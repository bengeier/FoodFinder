{"text":"One of my fave Filipino fast food restaurants here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Jollibee is a filipino fast food chain. The first time Kalila ever had it was in the Philippines itself! 

This place is great for a quick palabok (they call it \"fiesta noodles\") fix. Their chicken Joy is comparable to Popeye's or Church's fried chicken.

Kalila's favorite is their Jollispaghetti. Filipino spaghetti is typically sweeter and has hot dog in the sauce.

My favorite thing to get is the corned beef mini sandwich.

They have other filipino favorites like halo-halo, taro drink, sotanghon soup, etc.

Only problem is that when you leave Jollibee (located inside the seafood city market center), you will leave smelling like food."}
{"text":"I guess I find this place fascinating.   I didn't love the food, but maybe it's not really meant for my palate.

The menu is filled with Filipino interpretations of standard fare (e.g. spaghetti with hot dogs, slightly gamey fried chicken) and then some new items that were interesting.

It's worth a try.    Not everyone will like the intense flavors and odd combinations.   But the place is kind of a treasure."}
{"text":"My all time favorite comfort food!! Yumburger, spaghetti, Chicken joy and mango peach pies are the best!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with their spaghetti w/ chicken joy, plus peach mango pie!"}
{"text":"Jollibee is like McDonald n KFC join into one. As a matter of fact, Jollibee is even more popular than McDonalds in South East Asia. This location is in a nicer part of LV. Plenty of parking space n others shops to visit after a nice meal at Jollibee."}
{"text":"You may ask yourself, why did this guy rate Jollibee so high?! 5 stars?

Well, I have my reasons and I will tell you. I grew up in the Philippines, lived there for 14 years and when I did, I never really thought much about Jollibee. When I moved to the US for school, that is when I began to really miss the unique menu and mascot of Filipino fast food. If I had lived here in the states and just tried Jollibee, I can understand a 2 or 3 star rating. But I rated it higher because of them bringing it to America. It let's me feel at home, even for 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere, the service and the customers remind me of the islands that I miss so much.

That's why I rated it 5 stars, how many places can offer garlic rice with longanisa? Spam? Corned beef?! Pan de sal? All on the go? Spaghetti! Not many.

When I go to Jollibee, I always get the yum with cheese and spaghetti. Only in the Philippines is where we offer rice and spaghetti in the same place. Now many non-filipino's may find that wrong or weird.. But to me, its awesome.

Heck, even the McDonalds and KFC in the Philippines offer spaghetti. It's not your regular Italian style, we put sugar and hot dogs in ours. Which I think is better.

I think it may be an acquired taste, when I was younger I never really liked the special sauce they have.. But now its one reason I go there. I have yet to try everything, I usually get the same thing but that's because I like it so much. Anyways, if you're in the area and want to try something new.. That's fast. Go for it. Also, the good thing about this Jollibee is it shares with Red Ribbon. If you get a meal in Jollibee, get dessert at red ribbon. That's my 2 cents.. Centavos."}
{"text":"The location is great for those who live on the west side, near the movie theater also. The Yumburger was soggy. Palabok, Spaghetti and Chicken Joy was acceptable. The restaurant overall was clean and I like the fact that it's right next to Red Ribbon. 

I thought the \"Chicken and Burgers\" sign under the Jollibee sign was brilliant, it can attract audience not familiar with the brand.

Near the restroom area a saw a party section if you do decide to have a kid's party. It's tucked at the back of the store."}
{"text":"2 stars for the customer service. We ordered a to-go family pack and they forgot to give us the family size spaghetti. We already left the store, got home and realized we didn't have it. We had to drive all the way back to the store just to get it. The cashier who took care of us apologized. Thanks but apology didn't take away the hassle of going back. In addition, the manager, named Chris, didn't give a fck about it. I worked as an Assistant Manager at a food chain similar to Jollibee and I usually take the initiative to apologize personally, especially when I'm right in front of the customer in addition to giving them extra side, or anything extra for the inconvenience. This manager didn't do anything at all. No apology, no hi or hello. Nothing at all. Even after the cashier told him, he still didn't do anything. Seriously. I'm not cheap or anything but I HATE IT WHEN I DON'T GET WHAT I PAID FOR. Jollibee is such an iconic food chain. People travel long hours just to experience it. Imagine if this happened to people that traveled so far and realized something is missing from their order. Do you really expect them.to drive all the way back?! No sir. Cashiers/Associate ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING IF THEY ARE GIVING THE COMPLETE AND CORRECT ORDER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. Keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I can only tell you that the pineapple burger my co-worker got for me, I really liked.  Can't wait to go there and try something else."}
{"text":"This is place is trash they need to improve everything also the place is very unsafe for kids due to a fake bench"}
{"text":"I ended 13 years of Jollibee sobriety here a couple of weeks ago. I hadn't had it since I was in the motherland in '98. 

Amazing is all I really have to say. I'm certainly biased, but I really don't give a damn.

Yumburgers and Chickenjoy forever."}
{"text":"There's a man about 5' tall, dark blue pin stripe shirt, glasses, anyways I witnessed him grab a napkin, clean his nose, then proceeded to put people's meals together without eating his hand. I'm thankful he didn't touch my food. How gross! This is the Jollibee I go to. He did toss up front in view of customers. This happened about 10 minutes ago."}
{"text":"I like their spaghetti and they have a couple friendly associates.  The length of time to make the food is too long and I was told to order before coming in.  I tried calling and they gave one of my spaghetti away so I had to wait for the second one.  The Jollibee in Maryland is better but too far."}
{"text":"Just like any other Jolibbee customer service is always horrible. Crews are bunch of idiots. Visiting Vegas from California i decided to drive to get some food to go and taken to my hotel , well i should have known better and check before i left but since i was tired after a long drive, hungry and just anxious to get back to my hotel did not bother to check i thought that MAYBE they have better service in Vegas well NO. One of the item was missing called the place and spoke to the supervisor and Robert said when are you gonna pick it up are you freaking serious no apology or anything. I would never ever set foot again to this horrible with bunch of idiots ."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here! The customer service was horrible. I ordered a tuna sandwich an when I received it, it only had mayo and NO tuna! I showed it to cashier and all she said was \"Oh well, that's how they come\" and she didn't even offer an apology or to replace the sandwich. So I basically paid for bread and mayo! I wished I took a picture, but I just threw it away because I was just mad from the experience.  I will never eat here again or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I Try the big yum Burger,
 It was very bad, the flavor of the meat was worse than the ones at other fast food chains.The bread very fluffy and mediocre.They put too much mayo and ketchup. Fries where ok.
I havent try their fried chicken, hopefully is better than their burgers.

 Honestly, I didnt enjoy it, I should have gone to Wendys, at least.

The only good thing was the pineapple drink."}
{"text":"Checked to see what time they closed on a Friday night. Says 11:00pm. We get there a little after 10. Place was closed and they were cleaning. WT?"}
{"text":"Bad customer service! This lady name Amber who worked @ Village Square branch needed to be retrained. Perhaps, she should quit because obviously she was not happy to be there. No smile on her face, she looked grouchy! She didn't even count my change. She handed or more like shoved the change into my hand together with the receipt, coins started falling on the counter, but she didn't care. She just turned her back to do other stuff. Very rude!!! A big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Friends,
Please do not allow this wicked company to steal your hard-earned money any further. On July 9th, 2012, I was almost killed at this establishment. All I wanted was a little snackaroo and what did I get? One heaping serving of Jollibee shit. Seriously I had the fucking yum burger and it tasted more like a yuck burger. I could not even see the meat inside, as it was concealed in a clusterfuck of buns and shit sauce. That's not even the worst part. The worst part was the fries. They tasted alright, but at the end I saw the gnarliest thing in my whole life. It was literally a hunk of black Jollibee shit located in the back corner of the \"Jolly Fries\". The proprietors of the establishment claimed it was \"burnt fries\" (their english was not very good), but we all know that is codename for King Jollibee's shit. Please, take my words into account, and do not eat from these evil tits."}
{"text":"The food was great. It was a quick service. The cahier was nice except for the manager named Marivic Perez.  She was rude with her employees. She yelled one of her employee infront of the customer.  I mean that was not right. Be civilize Marivic!"}
{"text":"I never liked Jollibee when I studied in Baguio at SLU, but when you need some Filipino style cooking, you can't go wrong with this place. I especially love the Peach Mango Pie!!!! Their breakfast meals are great. The place can get a little crowded during rush hours, restrooms are useable, but the prices can be expensive. Otherwise it's worth driving the 300+ miles from AZ to eat here when we go to the Strip for a getaway."}
{"text":"Filipino Fast Food. It's so good yet so bad for you. The chicken was flavorful but greasy. I albsolutely love love love the gravy on everything. I could just have it alone with rice."}
{"text":"This morning I went there to pick up  breakfast.  To make a long story short, I had the worst customer service experience from beginning of the transaction till the end.  I looked at the name tag to see who was helping me and it was the restaurant manager herself.  Marivic, if you dislike your job then please quit.  I have been going to Jolibee for 10+ years and never have I been rudely treated the way you treated me.  You were very, VERY, rude.  Plus the fact that you got my order wrong made me more disappointed that a person like you, a restaurant manager, is running the show.  A big thumbs down for Jollibee"}
{"text":"Okay, the chicken here is bloody amazing. Honestly prefer their chicken strips over KFC's. As well as their gravy. 
  I ordered a big yum burger, and it had their special sauce on it. I must say it was quite good. 
   Really cheap food, and good chicken. Can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"service is terrible long waits, we ordered the spam sandwich and when i was eating mine there was no mayonnaise in it. this is such a simple sandwich to make only pandesal spam and mayo, but no, i didn't  get any mayo at all. id make this at home but im too busy. this place is a rip off, there are so many other good Filipino places to try. this place is not worth."}
{"text":"If you're craving for a Filipino fast food, this is the place to go. The food are great! A little bit on the expensive side though and small servings."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location I get really bad service!!! I just went through the drive-through and still got the wrong food I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I just left this place. If you don't want your day ruined, do not come here! The cashier was so rude. She made me wait so long while she talked to the other crew members and even the manager. 

When my food was ready, I just grabbed it from the counter. Even if the manager and that rude cashier were standing there, no one bothered to check if I was taking the right order. 

Thank you for ruining my Sunday! I agree with the other reviews and wonder how you manage to stay open."}
{"text":"Super greasy Filipino food and horrible seating arrangement! I feel like I'm in a horrible cafeteria eating food that I am being forced to eat even though i ordered this food hahaha! Please close this place down your killing all the people who eat here nothing on ur menu is healthy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive compared to what you can get at KFC. Its basically alive because of the Filipino population in Las Vegas supporting it. When compared to any other chicken chain it loses miserably."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get lunch. The only thing good here is the chicken joy with gravy. The new 99 cent corned beef sandwiches are gross, the tasty burgers has too much lady's choice or mayo. If you had to choose, go right next door to chow king."}
{"text":"My review for Jollibee was months in the making. Somehow words were escaping me on how to best describe my experience here. I struggled on not turning this into a fecal focused review about the place. as you can see I failed miserably. Well.....

Holy Crap Batman, that is what I was thinking a few hours after visiting this fine restaurant. Now I am not one to be crude, but their food is not exactly easy on the bowels if you know what I mean. I give it two stars just because of the twisted names of some of their menu items,. I had the Aloha burger and it does mean hello and goodbye!"}
{"text":"Do not get me wrong, the fried chicken here is good and so is the Filipino style spaghetti (sweet meat sauce with slices of hot dogs). I would give this place more stars but the only problem I have about this place is that the prices are so inflated! Fried chicken and spaghetti should not cost that much. Let us not forget that this is a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I wish they offered something for the pescetarians (why do they no longer offer milk fish?) but my little meat eating family loves this place. My love can't stop eating the bugers and my teenager loves the chicken strips with mashed potatoes and gravy. I do love their french fries. I can't get enough of them. Only when their freshly made though. After sitting out for 20 mins, I'd much rather starve."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and arrived at around 7:30pm. The line out the door had 2 rows. Although there was a line up, they are very efficient and provide you with a number/menu/order form while you wait to speed things up. Line up is also in a tent with fans everywhere. Overall, it was worth trying but I'm indifferent as to whether I would come back again. 

Food:
Ordered the B combo:
- 6pc regular chicken- crispy chicken is moist and tender on the inside but lacked seasoning. Okay but nothing special about it that would make me want to order it again
- Spaghetti - I didn't like it, it was sweet? Strange taste to it
- Peach mango pie - Good, I typically don't like apple pies but I liked the peach mango filling and just the right level of sweetness
And
Pineapple quencher- sweet but delicious

Atmosphere:
Fast food self serve environment. All the servers are polite and friendly. The service is quicky and well thought out to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"Got Taro bubble tea! Was yummy! perfect for me because I still can crunch on the tiny crushed ice. And the chicken was awesome as well. The spicyness, crunchiness. And the meat was very moist."}
{"text":"Ok now. For this location. I went to this spot on Wednesday, because I was on that side of town for a meeting. After my meeting, I decided to stop at the Jollibee because I really wanted something from there. As majority of the time, I usually get the Tocino meal. Well, needless to say, that is exactly what I got for lunch. I got the Tocino meal, a lumpa rolls, and a Baku Pandan drink with bobas. Of course because it was lunch time, I had to wait for a little bit since the Tocino meal is a breakfast. YES. the serve breakfast all day. THANK GOODNESS. Thanks to my Filipino friends, I now where to go, when the gals are not cooking. hehe. Thanks, ladies."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to have lunch at Jollibee for her birthday. We had never visited before, but she had always wanted to try it because she liked the bee logo and statue. Go figure. The place was very clean, but I thought the staff could have been friendlier, especially because we were newbies and not familiar with the menu. 

We got the chicken, a Yum-Yum burger, the spaghetti and some mashed potatoes. The food was okay-- the spaghetti and potatoes were the highlights. But the drinks just tasted awful (although they looked tasty). I may give it one more try, but I won't be rushing out to eat there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stop by for a Sundae, waiting to pick up family at the airport close by, NOT WORTH STOPPING! Associate by the name of Urika Ann on the receipt served the Sundae like she's serving a free Sundae to a small child, No question! Service is bad!"}
{"text":"Came here an hour before closing time and it was dead.  To start off, the spaghetti was delicious compared to other location.  Only downside is they are so stingy with their hotdog/sausages. 
Anyways every time we'd tell her what we wanted she'd whisper in her headset and ends up interrupting and cutting off our sentences, making us repeat our order at least two more times. From all the Jollibees we've gone too, everyone has waited till you were done placing an order to tell the people in the back.
Anyways, it took a good 10-15 minutes to get our order (and mind you it was completely dead inside) and when we finally got our order the side of the boxes was dripping of spaghetti sauce that ended up rubbing on the side of the plastic bag. When I had pointed it out, she just gave me a new plastic bag and had me transfer the boxes myself. Call me lazy, but when you serve me something like that its your job to fix it , not mine. On top of that, she just laid all the gravy on top without putting it in another plastic bag or saran wrapping it like other Jollibees."}
{"text":"After watching my cousin quickly devour half the menu at a Jollibee in Manila, I had kind of lost my taste for Jollibee. Now that there's one pretty close to where I live, I do wander in from time to time. That said, the service is sometimes really great and sometimes kind of off (or pretty off). I mostly come here if I'm feeling too lazy or cheap to drive farther for good filipino food. It's awfully convenient sometimes."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I tried there yumburger meal. What a joke. 
The name has no relevance to its taste. 
The name should have been yuckburger instead. 
The meat was dry, the tomatoes were soggy, and the french fries were hard! 

Only pro's about this Jollibee is the new location being near my area. 
Less crowded than the one in Maryland - and its clean."}
{"text":"Not so friendly staff but if you're craving for jolibee you have no choice. Just get your order in and satisfy your cravings for that fast food. The place is small and can be loud. This is definitely not a friendly atmosphere nor a place you can eat in a quiet side. By the way, don't try the halo-halo, it's not the best in town."}
{"text":"I come here all the time through the drive through. It seems like every time I need to verify my order is correct even is it's one meal LoL. Today I ordered breakfast about 8:25 A.M. With the friendly cashier at the window. For some reason it took a little longer then normal to get my food, but I wasn't worried because I'm happy they are making it fresh (which it was). While I was waiting I saw advertisement for a free coffee which the employee never mentioned until I asked. When I did ask she said it was not ready and it would take another 5-10 minutes for the coffee to be done. I got no apologies for any of the waiting time prior and none for the coffee not being ready. Who does not have coffee ready in the morning??? Especially if you serve it. 

P.S. Always check your order when you ask for all thighs or drums when ordering chicken. They always give you what they feel like giving you."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this particular Jollibee (I normally go to the one inside Seafood City) and it was a disappointment. I decided to go through the drive thru and the service was extremely slow. They were not even busy. You'll get your food faster at the other jollibee in town and they are way busier."}
{"text":"This location is extremely hyped up right now and wait time was three to four hours the first four times I tried to come. However, the fifth time I tried again but at 9 am instead and I only waited for 15 minutes. They open at 7 am so if you want to try Jollibee that bad, go early. Personally, I don't think this food is worth lining up more than half an hour for. 
The fried chicken is really good with the gravy. It's kind of equivalent to Popeyes for me. Their spaghetti is amazing and different, it is sweet. Their peach mango pie was also really good (much better than Mcdonald's). The pie crust was so crunchy and good and the inside is really juicy. I also tried their mashed potato but it wasn't anything special. 
I ordered combo A and B and it almost costed me $70. It is not cheap fast food but I would come back if I did not have to wait."}
{"text":"Ok... So for someone who has heard about this place from family/friends that came from or visited the Philippines & told me about this place, I find out theres one here in Las Vegas.  So, my husband & I try it & i was sooooo NOT impressed.  In fact, there's barely any taste & the sauce is watery.  Pretty disgusting if you ask me.  Sorry! The chicken joy is good though.  Similar to Popeye's (which i'm a fan of).  If I had to compare it to Popeye's, I'd pick Popeye's.  The only thing that i'll buy there is the chicken, the corned beef sandwiches are ok (i've had way better though), & the slushies (i'm sorry, I'm running a blank on the name of it right now).  The coconut favor slushy is good.  If it helps, it's the green one.  =)"}
{"text":"In terms of fried chicken and everything else they have to offer, I'm quite surprised how this restaurant took over my number one go to spot for fried chicken (Popeyes!). When I had it back home in the Philippines I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I guess since this is more of a North American take on it, it's taste is more suitable here! I've tried it in Cali and here and it's just as nostalgic to me as when I first tried it!! Aside from the wait times it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Tasty lumpia.
Feels good to finally have a Filipino restaurant on the southwest side. 
Prices aren't too shabby. 

Cons:
The name Yumburger is inaccurate. It should be renamed Yuckburger. Yuck. 

Will update once I try the chicken everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Long line up.. from 1.5 hours to 3 hour wait time.... the reason why it's because it's newly opened restaurant and Filipinos miss the jollibee from the Philippines.. when you taste their food its good but not that great. 

Jollibee chicken: its crunchy but if you will compare it to popeyes chicken i would say popeyes is still better.. why?! Popeyes chicken tastes good inside and out while jollibee its only outside which is the skin. Other than that you have to dip it into the gravy to taste good. Also, popeyes chicken is bigger n more tastey than jollibee... no offense.

Pineapple drink: it is good. 
Peach mango pie: it is also good.  
Palabok: it is good. 

I tried to line up for 2 hours to see if its worth the wait.. actually it is not bad.. also, my friends tried but only for their first and last. 

Its just really a newly opened restaurant thats why lots of people are lining up... thats all i can say."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken joy and some reason taste different and  no flavor..im disappointed and i can tell the oil they used its been old chicken was dark instead golden brown I wouldn't come back here after this."}
{"text":"UBE shake gets 5stars!!! Best shake that ever touched my lips. Not a fan of the spaghetties tho. The burgers are on point. And it's a lil pricey. It's good fun tho when I'm with my lil niece and nephews."}
{"text":"It's never like the original so you can't really expect that. Once you take thag expectation away, it's really good! Always one of my choices if I want to grab quick food. It's really good chicken joy! The service is okay, but I come for the comfort of home :)"}
{"text":"So if you're Filipino, you love this place.  If you have never been here, you probably think it's just aite.  Their signature dishes are the filipino spaghetti and the chicken joy with gravy and rice.  The spaghetti definitely reminds me of my childhood.  Slightly sweet tomato sauce with ground meat and hot dogs.  The chicken is awesome also.  Probably a safe bet to have your non-Filipinos try.  Skin is crisp and pairs well with the gravy.  And of course, like in true Filipino nature, you must eat it with the white rice.

This location is in the Filipino grocery store mecca and surrounded by other Filipino stores.  So there's tons of Filipinos. So Filipino transplants who've been deprived of this fast food will love it here.  This is the McDonalds of the Filipinos.  So if they are lucky enough to find a location, they/we definitely take advantage so we can get our fix.  Imagine if they took away McDonalds from your country.  Then on your vacation, you drive by a location.  Wouldn't you want to run in and order a 6 pc or Big Mac with fries? That's how it feels!  Love me some Jollibee!"}
{"text":"I've come to this location twice & it's been over a 20 minute wait for chicken. They've told me ahead of time that the wait is going to be 20 minutes so I just leave before finishing my order. That's they only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one, at least they let me know, but I would have rather just had my chicken joy :("}
{"text":"The spicy chicken and rice I ordered was good but I also ordered a side of fries and it was very stale and cold. It tasted pretty nasty... So my dad went back to ask for another batch of fries and they gave him a beeper, we waited 40 mins only to find out the girl forgot that he asked for some new fries. lol, horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I grew up on jollibees.  You get what you pay for. My biggest problem is is that it's a fast food restaurant that has the slowest drive thru I have ever went thru.  Mind you most of the times I am the only vehicle. So effin annoying"}
{"text":"Okay I thought it was all hype but I was wrong. Fried chicken was delicious and not greasy at all. Liked the sweet spaghetti with pieces of hot dog in it. Loved the pineapple quencher drink. I'll be back for some more chicken real soon!!"}
{"text":"So far so good, staffs are really helpful plus the food is served always fresh. My kids love jollibee so am I, so i keep going back here."}
{"text":"Came here today cause they open at 7am and they said the chicken will be ready in 15 mins so I waited but I was able to get my chicken at 7:45am.. why would you even open if the food is not ready yet its ridiculous"}
{"text":"First time I had Jollibee was when I went to the PI in 2005. Nothing beats having chicken joy (similar to Popeyes and KFC) with rice or Filipino spaghetti!! And the gravy that comes with it...sooooo good!

I wish there was a Jollibee in Chicago - but c'est la vie. When we meet again, Jollibee - it will be a great reunion!"}
{"text":"They recently put 2 Jollibee locations in the Chicago area but I live in the burbs and if I'm being honest with myself, I won't drive an hour or more just to have chicken. Instead when in Vegas you visit here! Place is clean and employees are friendly. The chicken joy and palabok were delicious! You can't go here without ordering the mango peach pie too. Try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"DON'T READ MY REVIEW IF..
1. You're not Filipino.
2. You're Filipino but you were raised in the US.
3. You haven't tried Jollibee in the Philippines before.

Seriously, this may sound racist but people who doesn't fall in these criteria understands.

I was born and raised in the PI and I grew up eating Jollibee on special occasions of my life (LOL). It is an acquired taste!!! You can't be craving fried chicken one day, come eat here and expect to have that American flavor to it. Same with Spaghetti. Filipino Spaghetti is sweet. Sometimes spicy. You can't expect it to taste Italian and be disappointed about it.

Their spaghetti is on point. Despite the fact that it only has 2 pieces of hotdog, or sausage (sometimes), it still tastes like home. I'm not a big \"chicken person\" so I can't really comment on the Chickenjoy. Their fries? It sucks. LOL Don't even think about it. Just pretend it's not on the menu. But my son loves their corn. It's just a little overpriced! I mean, you're better off buying a $1 can of Kernel and melt butter in it. 

But that's the point of coming here. Besides the \"hit-or-miss\" menu items, it's that \"I miss Philippines\" feeling. It's that \"teaching your kids their culture\", or that \"let's try something different\".

You honestly can't come here and expect a lot. Even the Jollibee's in the PI are not as it used to be when we were kids. Their servings are small and they only give you ONE packet of ketchup and ONE tissue to wipe with. LOL oh i know.."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for the past few years & have never really had any bad experiences. I feel pretty lucky after reading all these past reviews. 

Growing up in Manila, going to Jollibee was considered a treat for my brother & I! I enjoyed drenching my rice with gravy while eating that crispy, juicy fried chicken. Other times, I'd order the sweet, cheesy spaghetti instead. If I'm being extra fatty, I'd pair it with a cheesy, mustardy jolly hotdog & top it off with the ube pearl cooler (boba) for dessert. May I also add that the tapioca pearls here are so big & sweet & chewy soft that no other boba places can compare. Too bad they only have two flavors but you can't go wrong with ube!

And 20 years later, living here in the US, I still do the same! The taste may be slightly different but Jollibee will always be a favorite. It's nostalgic & I have little complaints here. Prices are fluctuated but I don't mind. I'm just glad I live in a city with a Jollibee in a good neighborhood. Most workers are always kind & patient so that's already a plus for me. 

Craving it as I type this! Can't wait to go back! Lol."}
{"text":"I watched Anthony Bourdain's new show \"Parts Unknown\" on CNN, and in this week's episode it was on Koreatown in LA. After watching this, I was starting to plan my foodie road trip to Los Angeles. I saw that he visited a Jollibee on that episode, and I remembered that there was one in Vegas. I went to the one here, so that it would help save some time when I get to LA (also to help save my stomach). I stopped by before going into work to get some food, to go.

This Jollibee is located in the Seafood City supermarket between Flamingo and Twain on Maryland. You can't miss it because it has a huge sign, and it is right next to the Best Buy. Parking here can be tricky, sometimes the lot is packed, and other times there is plenty of parking near the store. After you walk in, there is Chow King on the left, and Jollibee is on the right.

Jollibee is actually a chain of fast food stores. It is considered to be the \"McDonald's\" of the Philippines. There is a menu full of items: sandwiches, fried chicken, entree's, breakfast items and desserts. I wanted to try the same item's from the show, so I picked out an Amazing Aloha Burger, a little big bite Spam sandwich, and a Halo-Halo. There is a counter similar to fast food places where they take your order, and after ordering, the'll give you a number and you pick up your food when they call your number out. My order was done pretty quickly, and the employee's were nice.

Amazing Aloha Burger - A large burger that comes with Aloha sauce, patty, lettuce, cheese, bacon, and pineapple. The advertisement picture is misleading, you only really get a quarter of a slice instead of a round slice, of pineapple. The burger itself was very good. The meat was tender, and the lettuce was fresh. The Aloha sauce was more on the sweeter side, and it complimented the sweet-sour taste of the pineapple pretty well. The bacon was the key, it tied all the flavors together, without it, it would be a boring burger. The only complaint would be that I wished the pineapple slice would have been the same size as the one in the advertisement. But other than that, it was a good burger for a fast food joint.

Spam little big bite - A slider made from a sweet roll, with mayonnaise. This one was OK. The bun tasted very similar to a Hawaiian roll, but just bigger, and was coated with a light sprinkle of cornmeal. It was toasted as well. The spam was a little bit more salty than what I am used too, but it was OK. For 1$ each, it was a pretty good deal.

Halo-Halo - I think that almost every culture in the world has a version of a sweetened icy dessert. This one came with shaved ice, sliced fruits, red beans, fruit jelly, and flan. This version at Jollibee has a predominant coconut flavor, and is very refreshing. It was good.

For all 3 items I spent about 10.50. It was a good deal for the amount of food I received. The food was good, and so was the service."}
{"text":"Its Jollibee foo! \"Joylicious\" in every frigging way my friends! Where you can get your Filipino fix of fried poultry, garlic fried rice, lumpia, spaghetti, pilabok. and breakfast meats! This place is about comfort not quality; kinda like the McDonald's/KFC of the Filipino world. 

The food is always like a friendly call girl....cheap, easy, ready when you are, and always leaves you wanting more! lol

Definitely try out the breakfast foods, Tocino (Sweet Cured Pork) and Spam (Spam :) ) are the better ones, the Longanisa (Spicy/Sweet Sausage) its just a spicy hot dog and not the real deal here. Also they have burgers which are 2nd rate, so stick with the fried chicken, pilabok (Glass Noodles Vermicelli with a specific flavored sauce) and sides. They are greasy but damn tasty! The Peach and Mango pies are 2 for $3 and worth every penny!

Service is fast, friendly, and comes with a \"Thank You Mamsir!\" lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant is connected to a Red Ribbon bakery and in a nice shopping center that I frequent weekly. This particular Jollibee has absolutely the worst customer service and quality of food in the Jollibee chain.
 
The food regularly comes out cold (chicken, spaghetti) and what's astonishing is that front and back of the house staff is robust. The staff aren't really socializing with each other or rude as much as they seem to be focused on everything but providing timely and at best decent customer service. 

Do not come here doing meal times (lunch and dinner), they will either forget ringing up your order and you'll end up waiting for 30 minutes or they'll serve it right away to you...cold. 

As far as ordering the chicken here, beware of ordering the chicken \"spicy.\" They douse it in so many spices that its inedible as your throat burns on every bite. Our last and final meal here of fried chicken was so bad that my husband had an allergic reaction and we ended up going to the ER after that meal. Plus to add insult to injury, the bathrooms they share with Red Ribbon are always poorly maintained.

If you have a choice I would avoid this location and drive to the Seafood City location."}
{"text":"This is the only Jollibee I know of and go to mainly because it's near the UNLV campus down Maryland Parkway. It's located inside of Seafood City Market, it would be the first restaurant on your right when you enter Seafood City.

If you like filipino food such as palabok, filipino spaghetti, jollibee hotdog, chicken joy, or any of their popular items, then Jollibee is the way to go. It's almost like a Filipino version of McDonalds. It's fast food and there's also Red Ribbon next door to it or Chow King across of it. 

I like their palabok but my usual is their 2 piece chicken plate! You can have the chicken spicy as well. You can choose from a variety of sides (mash potato w or w/o gravy, french friend, or rice).

This Jollibee is pretty clean but most of the times busy because all the filipinos are into it. I would come here with my filipino student organization before too! Lol. Anyway, it's also open up until Seafood City closes which is like 11pm/12am! 

If you're craving some late night or lunch time filipino fast food, this would be a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"Okay so the customer service isn't as good. We walked in and immediately she glared at us then smiled. She wasn't clear with our order and she kept staring at us weirdly. When we took our order and she gave to us, she shoved the tray and turned around. Her name is Queenie Rio and she was kinda burnt out like our fries. She forgot a sandwich and left us hanging. I asked for more napkins and she rolled her eyes. This was unacceptable ! Never recommend this branch !!! I'd rather travel 45 min to go to seafood city ! It ruined my 10 friend's day. Smh !"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about? I came on a Saturday evening and waited 1.5hrs. The chicken which I'm told is pretty famous in the Philippines was so bland. The gravy didn't help and didn't taste good either. I'd much rather have Popeyes. Or even KFC would be better. 

The mango peach pie is basically a pastry with liquid. There was virtually no fruit inside just liquid. Careful when you take a bite, might spill all over you. 

The only saving grace was the spaghetti. It's a sweet sauce which I believe incorporates ketchup."}
{"text":"Good to have Jollibee in Toronto finally. Feeling like in the Philippines. Good food and good service. The kids are so excited also even they just heard it from their friends born in the Philippines."}
{"text":"So let me get this straight. I want to buy rice and gravy only, but I can't do that unless i purchase chicken also? Its unfortunate that Jollibee forces you to buy chicken when your willing to purchase gravy. My kids love their  rice with gravy but they don't eat chicken. Why would I waste food and buy 1 piece of chicken just to get gravy when I'm willing to purchase the gravy by itself at whatever they're charging. To top it off, their Manager Layda, was so unprofessional and ignorant, she answered her associates when they asked \"what my complaint was about\" in our native language (tagalog) right in front of me, assuming I don't speak or understand tagalog. I quote \"bakit daw hindi tayo nag bebenta ng gravy pag walang chicken, eh last pa natin  ginagawa yun.\" -end quote. (She asked why we don't sell gravy without buying chicken, but we've been doing that since last year) bad move in so many different aspects, Jollibee."}
{"text":"People that work here DON'T VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICE. They don't know how to provide it - at all! The food is pretty good though. I personally like how their food tastes compared to the other location on Maryland pkwy. 

But, every time I ask for a simple request, they say \"yes\" but never do it. For instance today, I asked if I could get two thighs instead of one thigh & one drumstick and the to-go girl (Jerlyn) nodded her head yes, but I still didn't get it. She should've just told me it was an illegal thing to give two thighs instead of saying yes and lying straight to my face...lol. I smiled and said thank you anyway and all she said was \"okay.\" Shockingly enough her Filipino mother didn't teach her how to say \"you're welcome.\" 

Please hire friendlier and nicer workers.. maybe non-Filipino ones because Filos tend to be rude 

PS I'm only writing this because this is the second time it has happened to me with the same person. Oh and the place is clean and well-lit."}
{"text":"Filipino interpretation of American Food, Hamburger and Fried Chicken. Of course there are the basic Filipino fare palabok.

over all the prices are comparable to Macdonalds."}
{"text":"Jollibee is a Filipino based fast-food restaurant. They have really good fried chicken. I love the spicy chicken. They give rice and gravy on the side. I always order a side of fries and the awesome mini pies. I had Jollibee when I went to the Philippines in 2007. It is almost exactly the same!"}
{"text":"I was NEVER a fan of jollibee in the philippines but I was curious to see what Jollibee Canada has to offer. Despite the long line- Jollibee Scarborough has excellent organization skills and you should not encounter any problems (besides maybe the heat- they do have fans) when lining up. The bring efficiency and practicality outside so that once you're in, everything goes smooth. The environment was also very clean despite the crowd. 

If you're Filipino, the Ambience is exactly  what it is back home. The music, employees, everything. I was just in the philippines 2 weeks ago and it was the exact same thing. 

Food quality is excellent. I got the 3 piece chicken , with palabok. Probably the top fast food fried chicken I have tried in Toronto (not just being biased). Chicken portions are quite large and not too oily. The gravy is so so good and I was impressed with the spice level considering when I had it in the philippines , \"spice\" is really non existent. The chicken was sooo crispy and their mashed potatoes were fresh (mashed in house) and smooth. I normally dislike palabok, but there's was yummy and I actually enjoyed it for once. 

Overall I wouldn't say I'm dying to go back, nor do I think I would line up 30+ minutes for it. But my overall experience was excellent. And I recommend trying at least once. I will be back once the lines die down. Great to have a piece of home here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Can't complain for the price, $3.66 out the door for a little burger, \"regular\" fries and a drink. Now the burger is kind of like a kids size but just the right size for my situation, I was just a li'l hungry and have been curious to try so I thought I would start by trying something simple. It ended up tasting kind of like meatloaf. They put what I would guess was ketchup/mayo blend for sauce. All in all it was okay, nothing to write home about. The fries on the other hand were better than your typical fast food fry. They were crispy, not oily but still had good potato meat inside'em. Hope that makes sense. I am interested to try the Jolly Spaghetti. Until next time."}
{"text":"The hype revolving around this place during the construction continues even after a month being opened.

 Be prepared to line up and wait for roughly an hour and a half to two hours before even entering the building. They do have a purchase limit of $50 before tax and no more than 2 buckets per customer. So if you do plan on spending more, have a couple of friends with you to line up. They implement a number system as you line up in order to prevent others budding in. So unless you're the only one planning to pay, then they won't have much of an issue.

The food however, does bring a taste of the Philippines here in the area. Their spicy chicken does not disappoint and is actually spicy. Each order of chicken does come with gravy as well (I use to drink Chalet sauce, but their's actually beat it) Their spaghetti is tradionally made sweet like in the Filipino culture and also includes hot dog and meat. My most favourite food off their menu however, is the peach mango pies. I can't help but order two every single time.

The line can be dreadful, but the overall satisfaction of leaving with two-three bags of food is worth it. Cannot wait for the rest of the menu to be released"}
{"text":"this is the Phillipino stalle of restaurabts in Las Vegas .   If you want a great meal then this is the llace for you"}
{"text":"Not being Filipino I did not know what to expect from Jollibee. I got two buckets of chicken with rice and mango peach pies. I got one bucket original and one spicy. The original chicken was nothing special but the spicy is comparable to Popeyes spicy but with more flavour. 
You get gravy to dip the chicken and pour on the rice which I enjoyed it was like a light kfc or simple chicken stock roux gravy.
The mango peach pies was great it's not too sweet and the crust is so crunchy be careful you might blackout and smash back two of three .... that's what happened to me.
I haven't tried the other dishes but I have heard good things. The recommendations was from my Filipino friends so It's probably biased, so I'll be the judge of that at a later date
In conclusion jollebees is a great comfort fast food restaurant,when you want something a little different from Popeyes and satisfy your Asian demon that wants rice with everything. 

Right now I'm gonna wait till the hype and line ups have gone down to go back it's good comfort food but I don't think it's worth wasting your day for"}
{"text":"Jollibee is the most fun you could ever have at a fast food restaurant.

It's called Jollibee for crying out loud! One of the plates is called the Chicken Joy. How can you not smile after hearing those words? Unless you are a complete banana.

The other day, I popped in for lunch and got the fiesta noodles. Basically, it's rice noodles, topped with brown sauce. I also got a side of the corned beef sliders. 

A funny story about these sliders. A few years back, I stumbled into a Jollibee in Koreatown (LA) after a very intense happy hour, and accidentally ordered these sliders. Ever since, this has always been a go-to item for me.

The service at this particular location was pretty good. I got my order within 4 minutes. I took it back to the office, but nothing was missing. Definitely better than the other fast food options in the area (McDonalds, Burger King, etc). Plus, who wants to eat at those places? Jollibee is where it's at."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, arrived around 3pm, steadily moving line through the tent and into the store, food in front of belly by 4pm.
Very streamlined workflow and greeted with smiles.
Juiciest fried chicken ever!!!
Pineapple Quencher was literally like biting into a fresh sweet pineapple.
Spaghetti is a sweeter sauce than the usual pasta. Nice complement to the chicken.
Peach and mango pie was oozing with filling, yums.
I'm a fan, but probably won't go through an hour line up again for what's still 'fast food'.
Excited to try the burger and vermicelli when the line dies down!
Everyone's bringing bags and bags of food to go."}
{"text":"Due to the hype i wanted to try this place out. Ordered the 6 piece bucket and got it spicy, peach mango pie, and pineapple juice.
If you want to avoid crazy lineups i suggest going before rush hours like major lunch or dinner times.  I went on a Friday night at 4:30pm and only had to wait 20 min in line and just 5 minutes for the food to be packed.
They are very organized with keeping the line moving and they look like they have plenty of food ready to go. So things do move pretty quick.
Was it all worth it? Yes and no. The chicken was definitely tasty, very crispy and not super oily. The gravy they include is a nice add on. Not used to dipping crispy chicken into gravy but it was like when you know something isn't good for you but you just keep doing it anyways. If there was a super long wait i would just hit up popeyes. I find popeyes has more flavour in their spicy chicken and its just as crispy. 
The other items however make the difference of this place to other fried chicken joints. The pineapple juice was very refreshing and the peach mango pie was super delicious. It is literally deep fried dough filled with sweet goodness. Think of McD's apple pie but 10x better. I would actually just go here just to eat the pie and get juice. Wish there was an express line just for those items.
All in all good place to try but not something i'll rush back to."}
{"text":"Spaghetti, Chicken Joy, Hamburger Steak, Yumburger... Can always satisfy my little, Filipino heart..

Brings back childhood memories.. 

Crispy-skinned chicken that comes with their oh-so-delicious gravy ; can be paired with rice, fries, corn, mashed potatoes, or sweet potato fries! Plenty of combination plates to choose from, ie. Chicken and Spaghetti! 

And their infamous Yumburger-- great mayo / ketchup sauce, meat could honestly be better in quality, but I still like it.

Overall -- good, cheap, Filipino fast food!"}
{"text":"Says they close at 10 pm we arrived at 9:10 and they locked the doors on us. So can they just close when they please?"}
{"text":"Tbh not worth the wait. The chicken was very mediocre. Popeyes is way better. The filling for the mango pineapple pie is just terrible. The pineapple drink is the best thing they have which is pretty sad. They might as well be a drink shop and sell just the pineapple drink."}
{"text":"Stopped in before seeing a movie and had a pleasant and affordable lunch with GF."}
{"text":"I waited in line for about 15 mins. I refused to wait in line longer for fast food. And I was right to do so. The good : staff was super friendly and helpful, place was clean and atmosphere fun and inviting. The bad: was all the hype worth it? A big NO. The chicken was fresh, crispy and juicy, but tasteless. Seriously needed some seasoning. The spicy chicken was too spicy for me, but some may enjoy it. The spaghetti was hit or miss. You either love it or not. If you like sweet spaghetti with hotdogs, you may enjoy it. If you're used to the traditional Italian fare, you will hate it. The mango pie is tasty, the dough is crispy and a bit chewy. Closer to the Popeyes pie than the Mcdonalds one. Unfortunately, smaller than most pies - disappointing. The burger parties and rice were ok. Nothing special. Portions small, but the gravy on top was decent. The Palabook was tasty, but the noodles a bit soggy. The fries, just ok, I prefer Mcdonalds or Swiss Chalet better. To be fair, I've spoken with Filipino friends of mine who have agreed that the food tastes different in the Phillipines and even in the USA. Not sure why, but I understand. LAST BUT not least is the price. For what you get, the value is horrible. I was willing to pay $70 to try it out, but never again. Chicken is cheaper and better at the competition.And did I mention they only sell the chicken in pieces of 6? So you either get buckets in multiples of 6 or single person combos with sides. You cannot buy single pieces of chicken to add to the bucket or order. Overall, I know most fast food places have rising prices, but at least you don't have to wait in line in a tent to get it. Tip, if you get he chicken, get the gravy to dip so that you have more flavor in the chicken."}
{"text":"Love the food.
Feels and tastes same as the Philippines'
My wife and I love dining here whenever we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Jollibee serves great traditional items like their famous Jolli-spaghetti, mango peach pies, and best of all..their crispy jolli-chickens! I'm a fan of their foods and I eat here regularly!"}
{"text":"When I'm on vacation, in addition to hitting up all the highly rated restaurants in the area, I also love to check out all the regional fast food chains that we can't get back in Chicago. You got Shake Shack on the east coast, In n Out on the west coast, Checker's in the midwest, Raising Cane's in the south, etc. After finally checking out the legendary In N Out burger a few days earlier, we made our way off the strip to get an old favorite, Jollibee.

Atmosphere: This plaza made me feel like I was back in the PI. When you first walk in the Seafood City grocery, you're greeted with the stench of fresh fish. Ah, I remember that stank. Near the entrance is both a Jollibee and Chow King, and then next door is a Valerios bakery. Pretty mostly everyone there was Filipino and you couldn't help but hear Tagalog everywhere you went. Even the service reminded me of the Philippines, with all the workers being super polite and addressing every customer as sir or ma'am. 

Food: Now it's been over 10 years since I've had this in the Philippines, but it still tasted exactly how I remembered. I wasn't that hungry so I didn't go too crazy on ordering. I originally wanted to get the cheese dog but it didn't look like they used those bright red PureFoods hot dogs that I used to love haha. Instead I went with the 2 piece chickenjoy meal. I definitely had to go with the white rice as the side. The chicken had a nice light breading on the outside and the skin was as crispy as can be. They gave a drumstick and a thigh so you know it was gonna be juicy. They don't mess with no white meat around here. The thing that binds it all together though is that gravy. It was thick, bold, and salty...a perfect dipping sauce for the chicken. Chicken + gravy + white rice in every bite...it's a beautiful thing. Some people may think that's a weird combo but just give it a shot. 

Overall, Jollibee gave me a nice flashback to the last time I was in the Philippines. Luckily I probably won't have to wait another 10 years before I get it again with a new location opening up in the Chicago suburbs pretty soon."}
{"text":"Love it. I ate here a couple of times, Since we don't have this fastfood chain were i live. Love the Spaghetti and palabok the most"}
{"text":"Jollibee and Red Ribbon is a great place to eat, decent food if you like Philippines fast food, however the dining tables and chairs are always dirty, I have to clean or dust it first before I use them... Miss manager pay attention to your surroundings."}
{"text":"Kalako motto ng jollibee \"jollibee happy\" bakit cashier kumuha order namin nakasimangot at masungit parang na iinis smile ka naman diyan BEA. Dika bagay diyan sa jollibee"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out but decided to wait for the lineups to die down. Came here on a Sunday morning at 11am. Waited in line for about 45 mins under a tent where the attendants gave us a number, menu to review, and took our orders on an order slip prior to entering the restaurant to present to the cashier. Overall I'd say the process and service was well managed during my first visit. In total we probably waited about an hour and 15 minutes from lineup to order to picking up our food. Once we got inside it was still busy so couldn't find a place you sit and took our food to go. Atmosphere was crowded but there were cleaners keeping the place tidy.
For food, I ordered the spaghetti and chicken meal and upgraded my soda to a pineapple quencher for $0.50 more and a peach mango pie. My husband ordered the Aloha Yum meal also with a pineapple quencher and peach mango pie. Here are our thoughts on the food:
Pineapple Quencher: Sweet and refreshing
Fried Chicken (Original): Crispy, juicy, tasty. Would go back to order a bucket meal. The gravy that it came with was THE best gravy I've ever tasted. We dipped our fries and whatever else we could in that!
Aloha Burger: The scent reminded me of the a Big Mac from MCDs but perhaps it was the sesame bun. It had a ring of sliced pineapple in the middle with some mango sauce. I am not used to eating a sweet Burger so it tasted different to me but not in a bad way. The beef was also like a different type of ground beef.
Spaghetti: This spaghetti was similar to a bolognese, however, the sauce was sweet...somewhat like a Ragu sauce and had bits of hot dog and sprinkled with cheese on top. It was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way just to order this again."}
{"text":"Sarap maging at home sa Jollibee! Everything is good, hot and yummy! Rice serving and jolly spaghetti is a very good serving size, way way bigger serving size then in the Philippines. Jollibee staffs majority are Filipinos and they're friendly too. But, I wish they smiled more. Always \"BEE HAPPY\""}
{"text":"Jollibee same as in Naga City, spaghetti with sweet tomato sauce and hot dogs
A bit overcooked and small fried chicken, like my native chickens in Bicol. But for a white man that loves the pinay it is a wonderful place to see the beautiful ladies of the Philippines.  I shall return ..."}
{"text":"Yeah I'm reviewing this watered down Filipino restaurant.  Reason why I came to eat here was because I was in the mood for a Filipino breakfast and this was the closest one to my gf's house.  What a bad choice. Sorry babe. Lol

I ordered the tocino breakfast, which came with like 6 small pieces of pork, garlic fried rice and fake scrambled egg with a tomato slice on it, and let me tell you... The tomato was so good! And that's it.  My gf ordered the spam breakfast.... The spam was cut the wrong way. How do you cut spam the wrong way? If it has squared edges you cut it the wrong way!! It has to have the rounded edges.  Spam lovers, YOU know what I mean! 

Our meals came with free coffee by the way and tasted horrible.. no wonder why it's free.  Good thing I got a cup of water too.  And the service was annoying, no kind of personality or enthusiasm, when I asked for ketchup, she gave me 3 packets.. I looked at it as she placed it in my palm... I said, can i get more please, she grabbed 2 more.. paused to think.. and grabbed another 1 packet.  Ay yi yi!  2 stars for the tomato, and good water.  Next time I come here is probably because I want something from Red Ribbon which is unfortunately, conveniently located inside Jolibee."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this very hyped, new fast food restaurant after a month of its opening! When I came by during the weekend, we were told it would be a 2-3 hr wait to get in, but luckily only took about an hour and a half since the lines were running pretty smoothly. 
For the overall service, I would say it was very organized. We were given numbers, already had people writing orders while in line, and once we were ready to get our food, the workers reread the orders before giving it to us to make sure nothing was missed. Despite how busy it was, the workers handled it pretty well. 
For the food, I tried their chicken, spaghetti, and peach mango pies. The chicken was crispy, sort of like Popeyes but had a lighter taste, and even better with their gravy. The spaghetti is really good if you're into sweet sauces, since it's on the sweeter side. My favourite would have to be their peach mango pies! If you're thinking it'll just be an average pie similar to what they sell at mcdonalds, it's so much better!! It's crispy, and the flavours just go so well together and is not overly sweet (bought seven and my family finished it in one day) 
I personally thought it was worth the wait and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Today is New Year's Day 2018! 
We are going home from Arizona and decided to stopped in Jollibee since I am craving for Palabok  (I usually get it from Valerios Bakery, but they only make it on the weekends).
The pancit palabok has barely had any sauce at all, it's like eating a dry plain noodles. Sauce makes it taste like palabok, but the one I got did not taste like it. It was a take out, so I called and talked to the manager, she just said sorry about it. I told her that whoever was in the kitchen wasn't  doing a good job. A little bit more sauce won't cost them a lot but will make the customer happy. If you are looking for a fast food , go somewhere else  or get some good bbq inside Seafood City grill."}
{"text":"Let me keep this review simple.
It is my first time here and had a great experience at this location.
The employees here are professional and nice, atmosphere is clean, and their prices are affordable especially their meals. 
Tonight I ordered the C1 spicy and I was impressed. Their fried chicken was moist and gravy was delicious! I will definitely be back and hope this place is consistent with their portions, quality of meat, the taste and texture of their gravy."}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast here...looks like they really cutting back but increasingly pricey but very little portions. This should not be considered fast food when in reality it's very slow service. Hardly anyone there but we were given one of those beeper when are order was ready. Paid more here compared to mc Donald's or jack in the box. I would not recommend this place to any of my Filipino friends. Looks as if they took away the tv. Maybe people were just using the place to view the Filipino channel and wouldn't leave. Another cut back to create more revenues."}
{"text":"Was told the wait time was 1hr. Waited 2hrs total to get our food. Finally got home to find out we didn't receive one of our orders. Missing the burger steak that I've been wanting to try. Honestly really pissed that I didn't get the order, tried calling and no one is answering the call."}
{"text":"Worst Jollibee customer service I have experienced. We were there on April 15, monday at 9:30 am - whoever was the attending Manager during that time should be fired because of lack of customer service skills. I have to specifically ask him to pack our chicken joy properly even though I have informed them that we will bring it on an airplane for present/\"pasalubong\". And at first he suggested to just put it in a sloppy box. I can tell he was upset and throwing small tantrums with the way he handled our orders, he didn't even talk to me, no eye contact at all and with a blank face. He didn't live up to my supposed to be a jolly Jollibee experience. No one should be putting up with this kind of manager. I hope the owner or higher supervisor should do something about this."}
{"text":"I'm really saying 3.5 stars... or 3.75.. 

Please, people, don't sleep on the spicy Chickenjoy! I don't know why, but it's some of the most satisfying spicy fried chicken out there. Plus, chicken and rice is a universally delicious combination that is exponentially improved here with spice and a side of gravy. It's taken to even higher levels with the ability to add fries, burgers, or filipino spaghetti (complete with cheese and hot dogs). Don't sleep on filipino spaghetti either. And, finally, if your greedy meter is maxed out, you can always pop in and order filipinos empanadas (less flaky, more doughy/thicker like pie) or desserts (ube cake and mango cake for the win) and breads from the adjacent Red Ribbon Bakeshop.

If you're too lazy to hit up Red Ribbon, the Jollibee dessert pies are surprisingly good. The banana langka is a pie version of turon (banana and jackfruit eggrolls) that are good but make me sad for actual turon. However, that and the alternate flavor - mango peach  are served flaky and warm. And, of course, you can't go wrong with halo-halo. 

A word of warning (and the primary reason I don't give more stars): The drive-thru almost consistently is either slow or makes mistakes on orders. Once, my sister drove all the way home, eager to share spicy Chickenjoy, only to find that all the chicken was sans the \"spicy\". Make sure to check your order - the red flag and specks of spice should be clearly visible. Also, I find that three family buckets options are weird and force us to order a lot more a la carte. Perhaps smart on their part, but frustrating and far from satisfying for me."}
{"text":"Lovin' it! Busog sarap! My favorite since i was a little kid. Now it's here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came to this location a few times now

I never had jollibee before 

The chicken is really really good. It's really simple but they cook it really well. It's perfectly seasoned, I prefer the spicy one because it adds a lot of kick. It's not greasy and you can keep eating it. The chicken also comes with gravy which makes it even more delicious 

The yum burger is pretty good too

The pineapple juice goes well with the meal because it's so refreshing 

The pie is freaking amazing, it's buttery and sweet and savoury. Never thought that peach and mango goes so well together 

The staff are nice and warm as well

5 stars for the amazing food and consistency."}
{"text":"Finally tried Jollibee to see what the hype was all about. When I went, it was like a 45 minute wait. You wait in line and servers come around and take your order. When you're inside, you give your order and pay. I ordered a few things on their menu because I wanted to try everything out. I ordered the Jolly Crispy Chicken that comes with a side of rice, gravy, and soda, the spaghetti, and mango peach pie. The chicken was decent. I like it here because they serve rice, and I love my fried chicken with rice! The spaghetti is sweet and has a nice taste to it. And the pies were great too! I don't mind the wait, but would probably come again when it dies down and isn't too hectic."}
{"text":"I didn't like anything about this place. The food was bad. Nothing I tasted was good and I don't plan on coming back ever again. For the price I'd rather go to a buffet or other fast food spot."}
{"text":"Is it worth an hour plus wait? No. Is it worth a 30 minute to 45 minute wait. Yes. While I've heard that Jollibee is very much comparable to other fried chicken that has already established itself in Scarborough/Canada. That being said, I was honestly really happy with my order! The fried chicken does have a unique flavour; just the right amount of oil, breading, and flavour. The chicken is moist and flavourful all the way down to the bone. I would definitely have to vouch for the spicy flavour. It had quite the kick and was really good. As for the famous peach mango pies; also really amazing. The outside is nice and crunchy while holding in the not too sweet filling which was amazing. Honestly, I was surprised how well the flavours were balanced within the pie between the salty crust and sweet the filling was. Overall, definitley worth trying! Try to go during off times when wait isn't too long!"}
{"text":"Jollibee at this location located in the Seafood City grocery plaza is a fairly good size. Catering to the Filipino fast food king of the Philippines, it brings a taste of home to the US. Price is a little high but the food gives that taste of the Philippines close to heart that reminds those who are home sick or craving a piece of that flavor. Chicken joy a crispy chicken is their signature entree but with everything from burgers to rice to sotanghon to spaghetti....they offer a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch... Not crowded... Clean dining area...Fried Chicken was decent... But they didn't have any white meat for 20 minutes... Who has 20 minutes to wait on a lunch break? Mashed potatoes were basic. Bathroom was downright disgusting..."}
{"text":"This place is a filipino fast food spot which specializes in fried chicken. I always get the fried chicken/spaghetti combo. Whenever I crave filipino spaghetti this is where I go. All orders of fried chicken comes with gravy......thats how filipinos eat it (no mashed potatos) I have never tried any of their burgers, but their desserts are good. They have a drive thru which is convenient. They also have another location in town on Maryland Pkwy.  Right next to it they have Red Ribbon which sells cakes, breads and sweets."}
{"text":"4 stars for the delicious fried chicken & friendly service. 3 stars for everything else I tried on the menu. I would *only* return for the fried chicken and mango peach pie.

Went on Wednesday @ 5pm and did not have to wait for more than a few minutes inside the restaurant. By the time we left at 6pm, lines had formed in the parking lot. 

Fried chicken - Pretty darn yummy. Crispy and juicy with a natural flavour. They don't overkill it with seasonings and I like that. The 'spicy' chicken is *actually* spicy, not like the popeyes phony spicy. 

Gravy - Surprisingly delicious. I was expecting a yucko KFC type gravy, but this was different in a good way.  

Mashed Potatoes & Corn - Both standard but good.

Spaghetti & Fiesta Noodles - I wasn't a fan. I satisfied my curiosity after a few bites and that was more than enough. I understand the appeal of these dishes to someone who has fond childhood memories eating them, but as a first timer, I don't have the same appreciation. I thought both were overpowering and the spaghetti was too sweet. I loved the cook and texture of the spaghetti noodles, though. I was expecting mush but was surprised they were perfectly cooked. 

Aloha Burger - This was okay but should note it is very sweet. The burger patty tasted like meatloaf. They throw a slice of pineapple in it and add a sweet dressing of some kind. Other than the fried chicken, this is one of the more neutral dishes. 

Mango Peach Pie - I didn't think I'd like this, but I did. The crust is CRISPY, way crispier than Mcdonalds. I'd get it again, but I'm not itching to go back for the pies. Everyone seems to love them, some people walked out with 30 pies."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. First of all, I ordered extra sauce on the side and the cashier didn't know how to ring it up. Second, the special sauce here is not great. It is basically just mayo. Back in Hawaii, they're special sauce is actually different. After getting my order, I noticed that they didn't give me the sauce and when I brought them my receipt, they said \"it's probably in the burger. If you told them to put it on the side, we could put it in a small cup on the side.\" Umm hello, I did say on the side by the way. Oh, and for a fresh burger, the bun was cold and hard and it was just a plain cheeseburger. I think I'll stick to mcdonalds for now."}
{"text":"What was I thinking going here?

Once you walk in, you're greeted in two different langues at the counter. If you don't respond in Filipino, they say hello in English. Ha.

Ordered a C1, the two piece with one side. Regardless, you will get rice. You have a choice of gravy, corn, and mashed potatoe. Got my food and it was all right. ***AIGHT. Nothing special. 

The chicken was super breaded and pretty much meatless. I was all breading!

Other than that, this place was EH."}
{"text":"This place made me so furious and mad today with the level of disrespect by the cashier. We came here for a cold drink with some friends of ours. One particular friend is 9 months pregnant and I asked for some ice water along with my pineapple drink. My total came out high so I asked why. Kim the rude cashier said you pay for large tap water. Wow...$2.00 for tap water. She laughed with her coworkers Geraldine. I also asked about the slushees they serve and she starts speaking Filipino so I purposely can't understand her. I asked what is that flavor 3 times and laughed at me again. Finally saying it's coconut flavor. I asked her why she didn't just say that. The cashiers were beyond rude towards me and my family. We were the only caucasians in the entire restaurant and I know she purposely wanted to make me feel stupid. How do I know? I spoke with the manager and under her breath she kept talking about us. I did not pay for the water and instead left with a terrible tasting pineapple drink and a worse experience. I've never felt so uncomfortable being a customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here for lunch. We both ordered the chicken joy with rice. It was so good and crunchy, the chicken had so much flavor. I also ordered the halo halo, I might say it was a disappointment. It had more beans then anything else, no jackfruit, no bananas, etc all I can taste is beans. Will be back for more chicken."}
{"text":"Came here from work, bought 4 jolly hotdogs, spaghetti, fries, coke and egg sandwich.  They forgot to give my egg sandwich again! i just found out right after i got home, this is not the first time!"}
{"text":"Uhm I don't know why I come here.

I think it's because I'm yearning for my Filipino childhood. I usually hit this place up when I'm desperate for Filipino spaghetti. You know, the sweet kind with the hotdogs. 

I usually get like the combo mixture whatever. Like spaghetti and burger, or spaghetti with chicken or chicken with rice. I know, it's weird.

but the spaghetti is usually runny or watery with their sauce. The chicken? It's aight. I'd come back here only for the spaghetti. I mean, this is the only place in town where I know they have it somewhat decent."}
{"text":"Great filipino fried chicken which is not your ordinary KFC or Popeyes taste, this has a different take on the fried chicken, their spaghetti is sweet and their dessert drink halo halo is a mix of all kinds of sweet to satisfy those sweet cravings."}
{"text":"The last time I visited the Philippines was way back in '97.  We only went to Jollibee once, and I was so sick I stayed in the car.  My last trip to Vegas was just last year, but I didn't even know at the time that there was a Jollibee opening up.

This past weekend, I had to hit it up.  Even if it meant paying the $13 cab fare there, and the other $13 to come back to the strip (note: make sure you get the phone number for a cab, they don't come around there very often).  I was hungover, hungry, and already on a losing streak...Filipino fast food was what I needed.

My friends and I each got the palabok/chickenjoy combo, along with a peach mango pie.  I generally prefer Filipino spaghetti to palabok, but a few weekends ago Filipino spaghetti was all I ate for three days.  The chicken was without a doubt the best fast food fried chicken I've ever had, and while I've had better palabok (I prefer the kind with the thicker noodles), it was still pretty damn good.

The pie was also a must-try.  It beats the shit out of a McDonald's apple pie any day.

Even if you're not Filipino, you can learn to love our food at Jollibee.  Now if only Vegas wasn't the closest one to me in Chicago, I'd be much happier.

BONUS:  There was a Chow King there too, and though we were too full to try it, it was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"One of 2 locations in Vegas, this Jollibee is located inside the Seafood City on Maryland Parkway, just south of the Boulevard Mall. If I come here, it's usually because I already happen to be in the area and it's only for their fried chicken, or ChickenJoy as they call it. Everything else is meh. The sides that come with the entrees are usually meh too...they don't look every appetizing because they're probably just frozen or canned foods. I mean I doubt they're making fresh corn or mashed potatoes here. 

Prices are mediocre for a fast food joint and really depends on what you get. The chicken seems a little pricey but most everything else is cheap unless you're getting some type of new or specially featured item that isn't on the regular menu. Basically if you're coming to Jollibee, I'd recommend the chicken only"}
{"text":"i come here for 2 things only. the \"palabok\" and \"halo-halo\" they serve it styro foam, upside of that is in case you cant finish, take it home. compared to many other home-style filipino restaurants, i find portions of the eats to be a little bit pricey, and not as comforting, maybe because it's a chain. but, the palabok portion is just perfect for me. and i like the texture and thickness of the sauce. 

anyways, best part of my meal would be the halo-halo. its basically a cup of shaved ice packed with a variety of tons of oriental boba's, ube (candied yam), red beans and more tasty goodness, i recommend trying it for dessert.

for the most part, i haven't gotten the best service transaction. some of the workers here always look a little stressed out, and in a hurry, i feel so rushed.

they also have a drivethru lane."}
{"text":"Rude people! Noticed they're racist, rude to fellow Filipinos but nice to Americans. 

And before I was able to ask for breast for breakfast without an extra charge and when asked when did they change their policy, they keep telling me it's always been like that."}
{"text":"Oh no! Halo halooooooo...
 
Ok so I've had Jollibee two days in a row.  Yesterday I had a 1pc Chicken Meal which comes with a drink, rice, gravy, and fried chicken for $3.50 or so.  Good stuff to satisfy the hungry beast.  I was disappointed they didn't have any lumpia shanghai though.

Today I got the halo halo which was refreshing.  Although it had more toppings -leche flan, ube & mango ice cream, and ube halaya? and bananas -than the surrounding eateries (Red Ribbon & Chow King), it seemed to lack more of the other stuff like the beans, coco gel, and more gulaman. I made it home and the bed of ice is what kept it alive until after a pancit and fish with rice dinner.  I also had 2 peach mango pies to go and man, what can I say but absolutely scrumptious!

5 stars b/c I was satisfied with getting my Filipino fix.  

The sweet spaghetti is not bad either. Masarap! =)"}
{"text":"I first had this in San Diego when some of my Filipino friends took me. It's fast food but, dang, it's good. I was comfortable eating here although it might be because I can speak Tagalog and already know my way around the menu. I have to say that I didn't notice too many 'outsiders' eating here. Not sure why though because the flavor is awesome. From the spices on the chicken to the gravy along with it and the perfectly al dente noodles and the sweet spaghetti sauce. Line is long but don't be intimated. It goes fast and people are friendly. Should have one of these on every corner like every other fast food. I don't always eat fast food but when I do, it's delicious."}
{"text":"something appalling and racist happened to me a few weeks ago, but i never had the chance to post it until now. 

i saw that there was a \"now hiring\" sign in front of jollibee, so i went in to ask if they're hiring and if i can receive an application (since i've been desperately looking for a job). the employee asked her manager, then the manager looked at me and hesitantly said, \"uh...yeah we're hiring...\"

after i got my food, i asked another employee if i can get an application, but she was looking at me weirdly and she was beating around the bush like, \"uh my manager is getting it for you now...\" when she never asked the manager in the first place. in that short amount of time, i was already fed up so i took my food and left. 

it was clear that they were discriminating against me because i'm not full Filipino. i couldn't believe what i was going through at that moment. for the manager to not even look me in the eye and for the employees to act like i wasn't even from this planet is so ridiculous and racist. chow king is from the same company. they may not have the same manager, but an African American individual works there! and jollibee won't hire anyone else except for Filipinos?! i find it extremely shameful. this location has put a shame to jollibee and its mothering company. 

i will NEVER return here again!!!"}
{"text":"A little update from my previous review. Rules at Jollibee: 
* There is a  $50 limit or 2 buckets of chicken. 
*Must enter the first tent to be able to get to the second tent(duh)
*At the entrance of the 2nd tent, you and your friends, if they want to, receive a number that allows you to get inside and into the purchasing line. 
*If you dont have a number you cant purchase anything and get sent to the dining section."}
{"text":"What the heck is all the Rave about this place?!  Ok!  Maybe it's a phillipine local thing and to appreciate it you would have to have grown up there.  I would describe this place as Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's - fast food gone wrong.  And what the heck are those over priced fried rice and fried spam?  Um???!! I can make that at home for a fraction of what they charge.  Ok,
The Halo, halo and the filipino spaghetti will at least each get a star.  Oh not to mention, the Palabok?  Let me just say that if you've had the home made version, then their's is gross."}
{"text":"I swear my peoples love themselves some Jollibee.

It's Jolibee! I don't like Jolibee sure I'll eat it once in a while like when I'm in a group and the majority want this over wise HELL NO you have to drag me in here. 

It's a popular Filipino fastfood joint. It's almost always busy especially when its time to eat. I can't never find an open seat. Their food is pretty much like the usual American fastfood but with a Filipino flare. They don't have just any kind of spaghetti they have Filipino spaghetti, laced with lots of sugar and mixed with hotdog. I kind of like their chicken but not as much as some who think their chicken is amazing. They have pancit, good desserts, and a mascot.

Ok, so maybe I like Jollibee a little but not enough to bump it higher.

It's located inside a center with Seafood City, Chowking, and.other Filipino shops. Vegas has lots of other options for Filipino food but there's only one place like Jollibe."}
{"text":"I love it! This is basically my childhood. Always craved for chicken joy and fries. Never get's old for me. So happy they finally opened here in Canada. I hope they stop the limit per order rule though."}
{"text":"I was excited when this place opened. I heard a lot of positive reviews how good the fried chicken. A coworker of mine even mention that he would take his family to California just to taste Jollibee's famous chicken. I tasted it and was very disappointed and I went back a couple of more times after that and still didn't like it. Let's just say Pop eyes and churches chicken taste way better than Jollibee's.  I don't really care to much about their burger either. Come on pineapple in a burger??? Or sweet redish mayo on a cheese burger??. I gave it 2 stars because it is part of the filipino \"culture\"."}
{"text":"I change my mind to give 4 start(before is 1 start because line up too long[5hrs] and give up). Now, they learn and improve the customer service, hire more worker, only use one tent for line up, and some people will tell you how long have to wait when you prepare to line up.

When you line up to the last line in the tent, their worker will give you a paper and menu to select what you want, when you go inside the store and pay money, only pass the paper to the cashier and the food will come after 7 minutes. They really improve the customer service and make everything clear! Now , line up only 2 to 3 hour.

The crispy chicken really better than Popeye and KFC, the grave is tasty. 

I do not give 5 start because I do not think that is the best fried chicken in Toronto, but it is really tasty. And this chicken do not worth  3 hours to line up, 2 hours I think is ok to try, if you never try that before. I try it today, in my mind, only worth one hour to line up."}
{"text":"Needs improvement both food and cleanliness.  The restroom was dirty, the table was sticky and the chicken that I ordered was not cooked all the way through.  I have visited this location before and had better experience,  it just needs more effort to do things better and more consistency."}
{"text":"Wait time as of 05/29 7-8PM was roughly 25-35 minutes from the start of the line to receiving my food, this may vary from day to day so don't base your experience with mine. 

The way they ran the line is very efficient you figure out your order before you even step in which speeds things up a lot because they eliminate the factor of people blankly staring at the menu. The kitchen staff seem to always be replenishing items so realistically all you're waiting for is them piecing your order together. Seem to know how to run a high volume business. 

They have now upped the max to $60 and 3 Buckets per person. I did find it a little expensive at first but comparing to KFC and Popeyes it's not the BIGGEST difference in price. 

As for the food, the chicken was good similar to Popeyes but wasn't as battered and none of it was dry what so ever. I didn't like the spaghetti but my friend did, something about it threw me off and it wasn't because it was too sweet. The burger steak with the mushroom gravy was good but just reminded me of those frozen Salisbury steak dinners LOL. The gravy that came with the chicken didn't really get used as it didn't really compliment it. The peach mango pie was okay but I could taste the oil off the crust and couldn't get over that. Pineapple drink tasted like a pineapple drink lol.

Everything was OK-Mediocre... until I brought a extra bucket home for family to try it and we found a piece that was obviously undercooked. With such high volume I understand but at the same time with the health and safety of customers on the line its something that should be taken more seriously.

I'll come back when things die down."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I came here, but I was surprised to find it was spaghetti with some sort of gravy for sauce and fried chicken as a side. Didn't really set well with my stomach as far as taste, and the price was a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"I had no idea it is a Philippino restaurant. Looks like a typical fast food joint. I live in the neighborhood and saw \"Chicken and Burgers\" so I walked in for some chicken.  
I ordered the 3 peace chicken. Asked for all white meat. They said it is a 25 minute wait for all white. Don't know why but I said I'll wait. On the menu it says $1 upgrade for white meat. That was fine until I paid, and discovered it is $1 per peace! 3 peace chicken = $3. Not cool. 
Chicken was served with two sides. 6-7 peaces of french fries and a tablespoon of corn. Chicken was decent but not worth $12. Pepeys chicken is much better for half the price. 
I'm never going there again."}
{"text":"It was finally our last day in Vegas and we were about to head home. Missed the free breakfast buffet from the hotel because I had too much to drink the night/midnight before and couldn't get out of bed.. anyone smell a hangover?

aaaaannnyway.. so we decided to grab something quick (and cheap) to eat. Jollibee!!! Never been so happy to see that red bee smiling at me.

I had ordered the usual jollibee spaghetti. Now, if you like sweet spaghetti with slices of sausage/hotdog in your chunky spaghetti. Def give this one a go. If not, then go... far far away.

The only thing I could stomach that time was the spaghetti so we took the peach mango pie (you gotta try this one!!!!) to go.

The place is nice and clean. The only difference about this branch is that they had the soda fountain open to everyone."}
{"text":"Heard people waited for hours for this Filipino restaurant-- save your time and money! Fried chicken and noodles -- odd odour, and mushy texture. 
No thank you"}
{"text":"Those employee so rude especially the one with glasses and the shorther one, i ask for the fucking ketchup they look each other and laugh at me wtf!!!"}
{"text":"I had the fiesta noodles which were okay but I wasn't in the mood for noodles though. My boyfriend ordered for me since I had a little difficulty in deciding. Their chicken is pretty good. Crispy and juicy! Fries were a no brainer as well. 

But then I had the peach mango pie... I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"satisfies your craving for filipino best selling chain for a price! good to visit with kids. The place is ususally packed on weekends. 
feels good to eat something you have been craving back home...
this place is the answer.
saw a couple of flies...maybe they were lost???"}
{"text":"After doing our groceries, my sister and I stopped by to get something to eat. My sister had a hard time reading the menu and without hesitation the cashier Alexandra D. offered my sister her glasses. She took her glasses off and gave it to my sister so she can read the menu. She's awesome! That's the best customer service I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"So I went to Red Ribbon next to this Jollibee and witnessed the most horrible customer service in my life. A guy comes up to pick up a phone order which apparently was wrong and the manager starts arguing with him saying that's what he ordered and she was not stupid. She literally kept saying she's not stupid to the customer and the customer said I didn't say you were but my order is wrong, can I get the order corrected and pay the difference. The manager said no and told him to get out. She had security escort him out with out his food and refund. 

I was like what the hell is happening, I had to pick up my jaw off the damn floor! The guy was polite and nice about the wrong order and this manger was going crazy. 

The people on the red ribbon side said this wasn't the first time she has done this to a customer, apparently this is on a regular. 

Just horrible, go to another location even if it's farther, giving business to a store like this just enables them to do what they please.

The managers name is Joy, which is so ironic."}
{"text":"I go here strictly for the chicken.  It reminds me of old school KFC.  The chicken is better than KFC these days and you can choose if you want 2 legs or 2 thighs in the 3 piece.  I prefer dark meat as well so I like that.  Then they still give you gravy and French fries as a side option, which KFC did away with years ago.  . So if you are going there for chicken, French fries, and mash potatoes with plenty of gravy, it is the place to go fast food wise.  The buko pandan cooler is also amazing."}
{"text":"I almost ate a crispy human hair on my fried chicken... Someone forgot to wear a hair net. Totally gross.. See pic."}
{"text":"Food that brings me back to memories of my childhood in the Philippines. Kind of took time for my take away order to be prepared. A couple of people behind me in the order line got their orders quicker - thus taking away 1 star."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for 3 things: organization, fried chicken, and peach mango pie. I'll also make this review right to the point because I'm sure everyone else has covered everything really about this place. 

The fried chicken? Get it spicy, and it actually IS spicy. I could see the reddish orange powder/spice on top of the chicken and it really sure has a kick. After chomping down 3 bites, I could feel my mouth actually getting numb. It was so crispy and that gravy, you really have to dunk the thing in there! It really adds to it.

The organization. I had reservations waiting 8+ hours, so I waited patiently till it died down more. The line was about 30-40 minutes on a Friday afternoon, you get a number and an order form. There are several staff down the road that will pass you a menu, tick off your order and then usher you inside to the magical land of Jollibee. 

The peach mango pie. I wish I bought 10 which would still be legal according to the limit. Crispy, tasted like a legit pie, and that filling was just oozing fruity goodness. I put my second pie in the fridge at home, and that thing was STILL crispy the next day. It actually tastes better than the Mcdonald's apple pie. I know, I know. Apples and oranges, but I just like the pie part (the shell) which was done better at Jollibee.

So everyone, go now. It's much more manageable than before. I would exclude weekends though because it's still such a hot joint."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Plain and simple.

And I'm not sure why everyone is saying that the staff wasn't great, whenever I visit they're always as courteous as can be."}
{"text":"I thought I'd check this place out since its near my job so I brought the entire fam. I had never heard of it before but thought it was worth a shot. Once we got in, I realized I wasn't in Kansas anymore. I quickly noticed I was the only white boy in the place and it this wasn't an American fast food joint. Once I got over that uncomfortable feeling of everyone staring at you because you seem to be in the wrong place, I reviewed the menu and decided that the food scared me. So I told the wifey, lets go and we went to Rubios instead."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to a Jollibee restaurant, but this particular place here in Vegas is always great! All staff are very friendly and accommodating! In regards to food, well it is Jollibee for sure! Chicken is always fresh, juicy, and taste like from the Philippines (at least that's what I remember ). Spaghetti is sweet and savory; and my two personal favorite, Jolly Hotdog and peach mango pie are the best!! I will definitely come back and highly recommend this store location! Need to try their breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Jollibee, why'd you have to go and break my heart like that?

I've always had a special place in my belly for this one of a kind Filipino fried chicken and fast food establishment, until yesterday. I haven't been here for a good 5 years...oh how much things have changed. 

First offense: an army of chicken fried in advance and sitting on heat racks. The chicken was soggy, slimy, very fatty and the crisp factor was out of the door. That's a fried chicken no no! Ugh

Second offense: 2 sausages in my sweet spaghetti. What happened to the promised \"meatiest, cheesiest, spaghettiest?\" This used to be my favorite item on the menu too! Double ugh 

Third offense: that burger steak combo meal was so bad, I really couldn't figure out if they wanted it to taste like a boot or what! Triple ugh

My beloved quirky Filipino fried chicken chain went down the drain. Cutting corners is what looses customers! Ugh to the ugh!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it minus 10 unfortunately I can't. Worst food I have ever eaten. French fries were cold and tasted like cardboard. The chicken sandwich is pressed chicken and it was dripping grease and the sauce tasted rancid. The ice tea was even bad!  Wow, stay away."}
{"text":"Long waits and it's not that good.  So expensive to be honest.   Not worth the line. I'm Filipino and I have gone twice but it's not that worth it."}
{"text":"Jollibee, jolliebee, jolli-jolli-jollibee! If you dont me, that's my chant for when we are on our way to Jollibee. If you get the chance you must ask me to hear the tune! Now, all kidding aside, this place is worth the wait! When I originally showed up the line was about a 20 minute wait. They take your order in the line while you wait and then when you get into the restaurant they just punch it in. Heads up, there is a $60 max per person.

I ordered the spicy chicken bucket, spaghetti combo, Yumburger and vermicelli noodles. My husband and I took it to go and we ate it at home. The chicken was delicious! It wasn't greasy on your hands as you ate it. The seasoning was perfect! My fav things were the spaghetti and Yumburger. The Yumburger was so yummy like later gator to the McDonald's cheeseburger! It's a must try. Whatever sauce is on it is what makes it. Spaghetti is super yummy, and was the one dish I was looking forward to trying. It was a nice balance of sweetness in the sauce and the noodles were not bad.  My husband said the vermicelli noodles were very good as well. 

In short, everything was delicious and I don't even have a bad thing to say because everything was worth the wait and I will be going back shortly for some delicious goodness and i suggest you should to!"}
{"text":"Well on the day I visited the line was 2 hours long and customers were limited to $50 before tax orders.  As a former York University student of the late 1980's a 2 hours line is no biggie.  I had a fully charged phone and my EarPods. 

The line took me 2 hours and 15 minutes to meander through.  Once in, the place runs pretty efficiently.  I ordered two buckets of chicken (6 pieces each) with fries, mashed potatoes with gravy.   I got one Yum Burger, three Pineapple pies and a Pineapple quencher.  

After such a wait the Quencher was served first and was downed.  I did like the drink.  I just wished they had refills or a larger size.  

The Yum burger was pretty ho hum.  

I took the rest home.  The food was still pretty warm.  The chicken was somewhat anticlimactic.  The daughter feels Popeye's was far better.  My wife, the one who sent me to Jollibee, was underimpressed.  The fries were OK and the mashed tasted like instant.  

I was hoping the food lived up to some of the Yelp! Reviews. Sadly there are better fries chicken out there and if you enjoy a good burger then this is not your place."}
{"text":"Love going to this branch whenever we're in Vegas. The chickenjoy and spaghetti and palabok are always spot on. It reminds me a lot of what we have back home."}
{"text":"So you wanna eat at Jollibee huh?

Coming from a Filipino, here's all you need to know. These guys are known mainly for their Fried Chicken, Sweet Spaghetti, Burgers, Hot Dogs and desserts. They have other items as well but these mentioned are what you will mainly see people eating when you go there. They also have all sorts of breakfast items as well but is only served during breakfast hours. Here is a link to their complete menu just in case you were wondering. http://www.jollibeeusa.com/menu.html

Whenever you see a Jollibee, in most cases you will see a Chow King and a Red Ribbon as well because all three are basically the same company. Now Chow King and Red Ribbon are completely separate reviews so lets talk about Jollibee.

Now why is it that most chains that originate from other countries just don't have the same appeal when they open locations abroad? I have always asked that myself. Could it be that something was \"Lost in translation?\" LOL. 

Anyways, the most common reason people come here is for the crispy fried chicken that comes in either mild or spicy aptly named \"Chickenjoy\". Now to many non Filipinos, when they get their order for the first time, they are surprised that it comes with gravy. Ironically, they are even more surprised that it tastes good with it! I for one think of biscuits, ham, or turkey with gravy. But chicken? Hay, don't knock it til you try it.

As for their Spaghetti, its definitely not what you are used to. Filipino style Spaghetti is kind of a sweet style of ketchup with sliced American hot dog slices and ground beef. Again that seems like a weird combination but in most cases you will be pleasantly surprised.

As for the prices, well the last time I ordered it was two 8 piece buckets. One was spicy and the other was mild. Total came out to about 23 bucks and change. So it was 11 dollars a bucket. Why is it so expensive you ask? Beats me. The only thing I can think of is that there aren't too many Jollibees around and the fact that each piece of spicy chicken has to have a little \"spicy\" flag on it tells me they have one specific person that does that and only that all day. So that person needs to get paid. LOL.

Service? Well it's pretty much the same as whatever other fast food chains you would patronize. Obviously the more packed the place is, the longer you gotta wait for your food. I recommend to just call ahead and order to go so by the time you get there, wait times will be at a minimum.

Last but not least. Desserts. For these guys, its simple. You have one of three choices. Halo Halo, Pearl Coolers, and Crispy Deep Fried Pies.

Halo Halo (translated in English as \"Mix Mix\") - Shaved ice with evaporated milk, mixed with certain fruits, jelly, and flan, topped with a scoop of either Ube or Vanilla ice cream. 

Pearl Coolers - These are basically smoothies with boba or tapioca pearls. They usually have several different flavors ranging from Ube to Avocado.

Pies - The best way I can describe these guys is remember when McDonalds used have their apple pies deep fried to a golden crisp? Well same set up here but different flavors. You got Peach Mango or Banana Langka

So overall an ok 3 star rating is my pick because the food is decent but a bit pricey. The fact that its a chain can significantly drop it to a 2 but these guys do a decent job of trying to serve the same authenticity as its original base in the Philippines."}
{"text":"An old time favorite always lasts. From the very first Jollibee in the Philippines, to California and New York, now it is here in Toronto, you are most welcome to be here."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed.... I've read so many reviews about Jollibee and was on the west coast so I had to some try me some Jollibee...I got the chicken and steak patty.. I don't eat pork so their famous spaghetti and glass noddles was out of the question... The chicken was avenge.. Not oily, crust light, and hot and fresh... The gravy so good as well.. The only thing I didn't like was the steak!  It was mushy and room temperate... Over all Popeyes is better with Jollibee gravy...."}
{"text":"Jollibee is a fast food chain restaurant that originates from the Philippines. The location at Kennedy Commons Plaza is their first foray into the Toronto marketplace. A second location will be opening at Seafood City Supermarket in Mississauga sometime in 2018.

I just got back this afternoon from Jollibee's and the wait times have died down. The wait this afternoon was only 1 hour, when the place first initially opened, the wait times were anywhere from 6-8 hours. You enter a tent and are given a number and you wait in line inside the tent,  When you get closer to the front, a staff member asks you what you want to order and you are given a slip with your order details.

I ordered a 6 piece bucket of the crispy fried chicken ($14.99 plus tax), you have the option of regular or spicy, I went with regular. A container of gravy also comes with the fried chicken. I also ordered the Amazing Aloha burger ($6.99 plus tax) which is a burger with cheese, bacon, lettuce and pineapple topped with a honey mustard dressing. I also ordered a pineapple juice ($2.49 plus tax) as a beverage.

The Amazing Aloha burger was surprisingly really good, juicy patty and the pineapple gives it a nice sweet balance. It won't blow you away in comparison to a lot of gourmet burger joints in Toronto but for a fast food chain burger, it's pretty good.

The crispy fried chicken was just okay. It's nice light, juicy and has a nice crispy skin but I found the seasoning to be a little underwhelming. Perhaps I should have went with the spicy option. I have tried a lot of fried chicken places in Toronto and I didn't personally get the feeling of wow, that's really good when I first bit into the fried chicken. At the same time, it wasn't bad but nothing special. The gravy was pretty good.

The pineapple juice was really good and really refreshing and something nice to offset a fast food meal.

Overall, Jollibee is a pretty decent option for a fast food chain and reasonably priced in comparison to other fast food chains in Toronto."}
{"text":"So we arrived in Vegas at the crack of dawn, not wanting to drive through the desert  from LA during the day where the desert heat would just kill you. First order of the day: breakfast - at Jollibee. 

MOST of their breakfast fare was just reeking with grease. Literally. Plus the salt, everything was just toooo salty, period. Jollibee, people are quite health conscious nowadays, and they start to watch what they eat. So please, tweak your products a little better to keep your customers somewhat healthy!"}
{"text":"The only reason this is a 2/5 star rating is because of the high level of customer service. I would rate the food 1/5 stars.

I went to Jollibee today as I live close by and even with the freezing rain storm, there was an 1 - 1.5 hour wait. 

It's that they have heaters in the tent to keep you warm while you wait out in the cold. They have security guards at both entrance and exit at each tent to help keep things orderly(I've been using them to check the wait time when I pass by on the way home from work every day). As you get closer to the front doors, a Jolibee employee brings you a menu takes your order and writes it down on a slip. They do this so your order is quick and easy when you get to the counter to reduce wait time.

To keep it simple, I feel all of the food needs improvement outside the Pineapple Drink and Peach/Mango Pie. The chicken is honestly the worst chicken I've hands down eaten. It didnt taste cooked all the way through, the \"spice\" they use on their spicy chicken is overbearing and has an interesting taste. The burgers didnt taste like normal beef, they had a unique taste. 

I'm told this food requires an acquired taste, not sure I agree with this...it just needs to be better.

P.S. PINEAPPLE DRINK & PEACH/MANGO PIES ARE MUST BUYS !"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick bite of Filipino fast food. If you haven't tried it, order a pineapple drink. Super refreshing!"}
{"text":"good food - but horrible customer service."}
{"text":"If you're Filipino, you probably will crave some Jollibee. Fried chicken with sweet spaghetti? Love it. But that's not the only weird thing, like showing sports at sports bars, why do some Filipino food places feel it's necessary to have bad Filipino dramas and variety shows on constant play? Perhaps they have a lot of customers that don't want to spring for TFC(The Filipino Channel) in their own homes. 

I haven't experienced any of the rude service that other people are talking about. The staff seems nice and tries to keep the place pretty clean. My only complaint about the service would be that I wish they would stop calling me \"ma'am.\" No need for honorifics. Plus, I don't look old enough to be a \"ma'am\" just yet. 

The food is pretty cheap here but overall, I've got to admit, it's not very good. The chicken and spaghetti is still a guilty pleasure of mine. Yes, I like sweet spaghetti. My mom still makes a better version than Jollibee but if I need a quick cure for a craving, this is where I go. So this place is OK in that regard. Out of everything on their menu, I will recommend the halo-halo (shaved ice dessert) and the pearl(boba) drinks."}
{"text":"How much do I love Jollibee? Let's put it this way, there's a picture of me my sister tends to circulate in social media wearing full on Jollibee PJs my first year living in America as a child. I grew up with Jollibee in the Philippines, left at an early age, but visited often while I was young. We stopped going there at age 9, so I was Jollibee-deficient for several years until Jollibee popped up in Daly City (with a 24-hour drive thru to beat... I went here for Thanksgiving one day lol). When I went to college, I drove an hour from UCLA to indulge myself with those flavors I loved so much as a child. 

This location is not as good as other locations, so don't judge Jollibee as a whole based on your experience here please lol; however, I'm still a big fan! They provide me my Filipino comfort food in Las Vegas. They have done a lot lately to improve - the spaghetti is now meatier with a tastier cheese. Katherine A. is right about a lack of consistency in their halo halo, but I still wind up getting it since it's hard to find a decent halo halo in Vegas near me that has all the ingredients I want. My mom loves halo halo, she gets it almost weekly back in the Bay Area. One hot summer day she got halo halo from here, and said it wasn't the same as the one in Daly City. The staff is very friendly and shows you that winning Filipino hospitality, but your food might just take a bit longer than you're used to at other fast food places. I've been told 10-15 minutes waits on food items, like the hot dog or ChickenJoy. The wait is worth it though to get to dip that crispy skin into their tasty gravy (and leave the white meat for someone else eat :D). If you miss TFC, they have a TV in here playing all day. It's also connected to Red Ribbon, so I tend to order at both if I come inside. If you haven't been here already, give it a shot, you might find something you like :D"}
{"text":"It's nice that this location has a drive thru and it's attached to a red ribbon. I can get my filipino spaghetti with my filipino pastries. I feel like the chicken here is a hit or miss, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. The pies are good and I haven't tried the burgers because I can get a burger anywhere else. The coolers are yummy when the machine is working and the halo halo is not bad especially on a hot day"}
{"text":"Since I'm dating a woman from the Philippines I figured we would give this a shot. Gotta say I impressed. Almost like KFC just less known I suppose. I enjoyed the food here. Very nice place right next to a movie theater. Can't ask for more"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! 20 minute wait for one item!!!!!! And for the 10th time, an incomplete order!! Sigh. I keep giving this place a chance but they keep on letting me down."}
{"text":"Worst play i been too... They wer trying to charge me for gravy when they didnt even give us gravy for our order and they expect us too eat with spoon or fork what kind of place are u... Bad customoer service i give one star just sonincan post it coz incant post with a star"}
{"text":"Ok, so when I go back on my trips to Vegas, this place is right acroos the street from where I stay..As much as I don't like this place, I find myself constantly trying it out again, and again and again...like a bad movie on replay...I think it's because they have Spam there...and yes that mystery meat people on the mainland thumb their nose down to...But we Hawaiians live on this stuff and Love it...So this is why I go there a lot, because where else in the states do you see Spam on the menu?...lol rhetorical.. Guess you could say I am a glutton for punishment!"}
{"text":"Today is December 29, 2015, Tuesday, 12noon, and they run out of SPICY chickenjoy. My family travelled all the way from New Mexico for it. What a big disappointment. We should have gone to the other location. :("}
{"text":"If I'm making an order and I can't have a certain side because it doesn't come with the items that I've ordered even if i'm willing to pay extra?!!! Really?! Any business that refuses money is not a smart business, as well as poor customer service. Canceled the order and left the drive-through, seriously the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Even with me being eight months pregnant they wouldn't make an exception."}
{"text":"Affordable fast food that taste good and is pretty filling. They aren't always consistent with the crispiness towards the last hours of closing. 

What's great is Dessert is right next door only 10ft from ordering."}
{"text":"2nd time around on a Friday afternoon: 2.5 hours wait!

This time, ordered more of the menu items we would like to try:
Burger Steak and Rice - delicious and comes with healthy serving of mushroom sauce and lots of rice! Very filling!
Palabok Fiesta - worth a try. Also pretty good. This is a Filipino dish and Jollibee makes it excellent!
Spicy version of Chicken Joy - actually really spicy! Definitely beats Popeye's spicy chicken. Fantastic Jollibee Chicken!
Pineapple Juice - soooo good! This would be the only drink I would order here :) sweet just the way I like it!
And for the 2nd time we got Yum Burgers, Peach Mango Pies and Jolly Spaghetti again! Consistent quality so far!
Over-all excellent menu items. They gave us a little menu booklet that shows new menu items like: BIG YUM and ALOHA BURGER. Should be coming soon, I hope? They didn't have them yet today."}
{"text":"My experiences with Jollibee at Seafood City and Regal Village Square are mostly disappointing.  I bought large fries today for $3.34 and get more or less 20 of french fries.  Yes, I literally count it.  Is this how they satisfy their customers' cravings for a Filipino taste of fast food?  I complained to the manager and all he said was they're just following the company's policy of measurements with food.  Are they weighing it or counting it?  All I can is... wow!  I was dumbfounded.  They would always mess up my order too.  I ordered C4 that comes with 3 chicken and I chose 2 rice for the sides.  When I arrived home (my bad not checking it) they either put 2 chicken and 2 rice or 3 chicken and 1 rice.  Hhmmmm... maybe 3x that it happened!  Are they doing it cause they know Filipinos miss the Jollibee that they have no choice but to buy?  Unfair!"}
{"text":"Went this morning at 7:15am. No line up, we basically ordered at the tent, then went right in to place the order.  For $33 we got two spaghettis, 3 pieces of chicken, butter corn, 3 mango pies, and 2 pineapple quenchers.  Not overly expensive, but not cheap either.

Food-wise, here's what we liked and didn't.

Like - Fried chicken

Okay - peach mango pie, corn

Dislike - Spaghetti sauce (too sweet)

Maybe next time we'll try the spicy spaghetti sauce, hopefully it'll be lessssss sweet.

Overall, not sure what the big fuss is about. Nostalgia probably plays a big part to the initial craze, but the food is similar to any other fast food joint.  Not worth a long wait."}
{"text":"This place is theeee worst restaurant in the whole city!!! Could care less of its franchise all around the world.. the fried chicken was horrible!!!  The cheese burger had green meat inside of it so i didnt even attempt  a bite of it!!! this place needs to be closed by the health dept, I just threw my food as well as my money away!! sTAY away even if your  ASIAN"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Jollibee? It's like McDonalds for Asian people. Love it. Gotta have my fix if I know it's in the area! Jollibee is a fast food chain and I wish they had it here in Florida. Instead of Ronald McDonald they have a statue of the big Jollibee for the kids.

It's affordable, and they have a breakfast and lunch menu. Their chicken is so good and their polabok is what I'm addicted to. Even the spaghetti is good. Everything I've had here is good and it's a fast food joint. They have pineapple juice!

I've been to the one in NY, and one in Cali near LA. This one was in Vegas and it doesn't matter where you go, it's awesomeyummilicious. It's so hot in Vegas, this one is inside a market so you can eat and shop or shop and eat. I didn't even bother looking inside the market, I went there for the Jollibee."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed because I really wanted to like Jollibee. The chicken was so much greasier than it had to be and the meat was bad quality. The fries were alright; similar to McDonalds fries."}
{"text":"This review is based mainly on chickenjoy. 

I am half filipino so it's no surprise to find myself at jollibee. This location is pretty big and also has a Red Ribbon inside which is a plus. 

I got the 3 piece chickenjoy that comes with a side. I was disappointed that it didn't come with a drink so I had to pay a dollar extra. The meal itself was $7. If this meal was $2 cheaper it would definitely be worth the money. 

As for the taste, jollibee's chicken is probably one of my favorites when it comes to fast food. It's always so crispy and juicy whenever I order it. The gravy that comes with the chicken is also unique and tasteful. 

As for the other food, I don't really remember how they all taste like. I grew up with jollibee but don't really have it now as an \"adult.\""}
{"text":"Decided to go to this location as my friends and I were around the area, and big mistake. It took so long for us to get our food and it didn't even taste fresh. I will stick to the Jollibee at Seafood City instead."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars, but no. Me and my cousin decided to go to Jollibee through the drive thru window. We order the food and one of the employee said to wait 15 minutes for the food to be done. After 20 minutes later, they delivered the food to us in the car. I was surprised that there was no ketchup in the bag. The food tasted ok since I got the two piece combo, but I wished I had eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"You'd think a place that serves my absolute favorite homemade breakfast meal would be great. There is a new Jolibee opening in Skokie soon and it reminded me that this has been in my queue for years. 

Jollibee is as popular in the Philippines as McDonald's is here. Same quality of food as well. You know what you're getting into. I know the spam breakfast is pretty basic but I love it. The tocino is pretty solid as well.

One time I went with my dad to get breakfast for the fam. I ordered two coffees and asked for a cupholder, since I was also ordering food. To hold the coffee, I was given a plastic bag. A PLASTIC BAG. I had to turn my head to hide my laughter. They told me they didn't have cupholders and that was the best they could do. A plastic bag. I was dying. At least I had a funny story to tell. 

Also, with the new Skokie location coming I will no longer have relatives asking me to bring back Chicken Joy for them. No shame. For serious, the last time my dad came to visit Chicago his carry-on luggage was a bucket of fried chicken from Jolibee. Sadly, that was not at all surprising."}
{"text":"I guess Jollibee is ok, I'm not a big fan of they're food. It's alright, not the best fast food place to eat but i do like they're apple pies. Other than that the just taste mediocre to me. Jollibee has a variety of food from burgers to spaghetti to chicken. Jollibee has two locations one in Maryland Parkway and one in Summerlin. It's probably the most famous Filipino fast food franchise, it's like the McDonald's of the Philippines."}
{"text":"I have not been to Jollibee in so many years. So I was really excited to find out that they have a Jollibee in Las Vegas. I ordered C1 - 2 piece chicken joy with rice. When I got my order, I was salivating but after the first bite on my drumstick, I tasted blood. I retracted and saw that the meat is VERY RAW and bloody. It was RARE. I lost my appetite and returned the box to the counter. They wanted to give me another piece but I refused and went straight to Chow King!! What a YUCKKY experience. I will never go back to Jollibee."}
{"text":"I miss the real chicken joy taste because while I was working in Qatar their chicken tasted different it was just like the ordinary fried chicken that you can order on the other fastfood chains. I was expecting the same when I saw the Jollibee here but when I got my order it tasted like the original chicken joy that I was craving for. And they had my favorite combo which is 1 pc chicken joy with spaghetti then I added extra rice and jolly hotdog. I wanted to order an additional Aloha burger but I felt guilty for craving and eating too much so I'm saving that for the next visit :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm jollibee, reminds me of my childhood, 2nd time already and still coming back to line up, very organize, they'll tell you about 3hrs wait,but I only waited for 1.5hrs.. once they take your order its very fast service and they also check to make sure you have everything. Chicken joy is juicy same as what we have back home,so as peach mango pie and spaghetti and palabok  very satisfied..hope they have bigger size for pineapple juice."}
{"text":"Aloha Yum, Big Yum, Jolly Crispy Chicken and Peach Mango Pies passed our taste test since they are all similar to Jollibee Philippines.

But the Jolly Spaghetti is such a big disappointment. The sauce and hotdog that they used are very different from the Philippines.  Big waste of money. Even actor Aga Muhlach would not like it!"}
{"text":"Hahaha this place is great for a Filipino craving of spicy fried chicken with some sweet savory spaghetti. Super unhealthy and it is to be considered as the McDonald's in the Philippines. I have it about once a year and I enjoy it."}
{"text":"Although the line was out the door the wait was 20 minutes from joining the line to getting my food.

I managed to try basically the whole menu 

Ahloha burger - interesting... but the bun and most of the ingredients were not hot or even warm. The pineapple slice did not have any caramel inari on or savoury element to it, tasted straight out of a can. Quality bacon strips were used in the making of this burger.

Palabok - looked really flavourful in pictures but kind of tasted bland...but I couldn't stop eating it.

Peach mango pie - superb crust! But you know how asians always say \"it's really good, not to sweet\"
This one was almost not sweet enough. Also lacked any intense fruit flavour even compared to the filling of McDonald's pies.

Chicken - ordered the spicy chicken it was well seasoned, inside and outside. Great crunch. Less greasy than Popeyes with just as much flavour. The seasonings just tickle the right taste buds, satisfying my Asian cravings in a way that Popeyes misses the mark. I had a piece of chicken 6 hours later and it was still delicious.

Spaghetti - imo the biggest surprise, the pasta itself was simple but cooked really well. A few pasta joints could take note. Cooked evenly, only just and not overly al dente, drained properly so the sauce sticks to the pasta. Then there's the sauce, the sauce that is most definitely marinara but has a pop of lingering sweetness, a lick of heat and spice, and aroma and notes of chilies. Varying meaty textures from morsels of hotdogs and ham(I think) complete the satisfying bite. A generous sprinkle of sharp and salty cheese balances out the sweetness of the sauce. 

Spaghetti and chicken both served at steaming hot temperatures make this joint a 5 star experience and I'll be back for it really soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place one time shortly after they opened. 

I wasn't really impressed with their food. The place did look neat and clean and the staff was very friendly.

Although I wasn't impressed with my one visit based on the customer service I'll probably try it again at some point."}
{"text":"Walked in and pretty much walked right out after a couple seconds...place smelled gross!!! Smells bad, the food can not be good!? No thank you, maybe another time..."}
{"text":"This jollibee location has been my favorite place to go since all the service crews are nice and always smiling. They serve the best chickenjoy ever  very accommodating store and you can tell that they are happy to work here. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Only one line to get in and it's generally 2 to 3 hours long there should be separate lines for dining and take-out only because takeout people aren't going to spend a lot of time in the restaurant they don't accept orders over the phone for take out only Filipinos can screw up a grand opening like this"}
{"text":"I love love love their fried chicken. I don't know what try put in it, but I find it highly addictive!!! The gravy goes well with their delicious fried chicken. Spaghetti is different, sweet with hot dog, but it is also tasty. But their fried chicken is out of this world tasty to me. I prefer jollibee fried chicken over any other fried chicken at this point."}
{"text":"your average jollibee with a thousand filipinos in it. the cashier person was rude.. i should of told the manager."}
{"text":"An ADD-ON rather to my earlier review and star value increase... I've become fond if their fried peach mango pies.  Jollibee's is the only place so far that carries them.  I frequent their drive thru and a couple things I really appreciate:
They inform me of the longer wait for the pies.
The pies are always freshly hot :D

I should also top this off with a couple other things:
The boba in their Ube pearl drinks are soft so I know it isn't stale tapioca pearls being used.
They NEVER forget the lemon juice packets for my Palabok.

Jollibee drive thru team you're awesome guys.  Keep up the polite and good service!"}
{"text":"If theres zero in rating i would totally put zero. This place is crazy stupid. Everytime I come here theres no chicken and you have to wait 20 mins. Which I'm getting used to it. But, the fact that they made me wait and give me 2 pcs of drumsticks when I told them to give me at least one thigh!! OMG!!! They should tot tally  closed this place down already."}
{"text":"Whenever I get a chance to eat Jollibee, I always opt for the spaghetti with 1 piece chicken and it never lets me down. This location is a mini Filipino town that has a supermarket, fast food, and bakery all in one. Inside the plaza includes Jollibee restaurant. The cashiers are very friendly and are fast workers. The spaghetti had lots of cheese and hot dog, while the chicken was crispy and not so greasy. I love that they provide a side of gravy to drop my chicken. The location is spacious and very clean. I would totally come back when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I was over joyed to see a new food place opening in the neighborhood, let alone a filipino joint!

The restaurant was busy and not very clean.

I brought my family to lunch in this area and had no idea what to order, but after a suggestion from the employees, I got the following:

- The Yum Burger
- Lumpia
- Chicken for my kids

After getting our food and taking our first bites, I knew it wasn't go to go well.  My kids didn't like their chicken and when I tried it I can see why.

The Yum burger was OK, but I wouldn't eat it again.  The lumpia came out different than what I expected...  Imagine if you took some real lumpia, shrank it to the size of a french fry, fried it dry in the microwave for 20 minutes and then added water and microwaved it again to reconstitute it.  You get an interesting concoction. 

Everyone also had a very heavy feeling after eating.  That is no good.  It's like you just put sand in your gas tank.

Regrettably, I do not recommend this place at all. :("}
{"text":"Huge clean bathroom, tasty breakfast food, friendly service. Nice flat screen for TFC and fans to keep you cool. Plenty of parking.  What more can you ask for in Vegas. We probably had three meals here. Jolibee, when are you coming to the Chicagoland area? Build it and they will come."}
{"text":"I grew up eating jollibee at the Philippines. It's nice to have one here in Vegas. Love their chicken and gravy. o n I can't stop by without ordering spaghetti."}
{"text":"Love jollibee. Love the Yum burger, spagetti, and chicken."}
{"text":"Second time ever going to a Jollibee. The first experience was in Stockton California. Last time I got the spaghetti which was delicious and more sweet. This time I got the Aloha Burger and fries. For a place that serves a variety of foods, they did a good job with my burger and it had tons of flavor.

Jollibee will forever be a unique place for me and this particular spot is a great place for any Filipino families or people."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their chicken joy with the side of gravy the BEST gravy I ever had. 
The yam burger is good and to add the dessert called halo halo omg it was so good!!! I will definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We waited about 40 minutes and ordered about $75 in food. We got two buckets and two family size spaghettis, 6 peach pies and the palak? Noodle dish. And a pineapple  juice. 

Overall the food was typical fast food. Nothing special. The spaghetti tasted like alphabet soup and the other noodle dish was quite salty. The fried chicken was good though, definitely better than kfc but very comparable. The gravy the chicken came with was good too, but the chicken on its own was batter.  The best part of the meal was the pineapple drink though. It had very strong pineapple flavour, that tasted like it came from concentrate. 

The restaurant space is a lot smaller than expected but once the lines settle down it should be sufficient spacing."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be straight up. This place did NOT make me feel good! I tried the cake or whatever, it was alright, nothing special. The chicken really greasy and felt weird when I ate it. I just really don't like the greasy chicken juice all over my body. Jolly bee? More like jolly B -hole! Am i"}
{"text":"After much insisting from people of the Filipino persuasion, I finally gave this place a second chance. The first time I tried the chicken from Jollibee in San Francisco, I didn't see what the big deal was...I thought they should have changed the name to Regularbee. 

So I was a little hesitant, but super hungry and ready to rip this place apart with my preconceived notions. But once I bit into that chicken,  my mind was definitely changed. OHHHH so this is what it's supposed to taste like? Okay NOW I get the hype.

Though there were a couple things I didn't like - they forgot some of the stuff we ordered with our meal and didn't give us extra utensils (it's not that big of a deal but we ordered enough for 4 people and only got one fork), so we kept having to check to see if we had all our food and went back up to the dude a couple times. Also the drink station and dining area was a little messy and unkept...the workers were bringing out food to people so I'm sure at least one of the many saw the state of things and clearly did not care. 

All in all, I'd say my chicken was a redeemer. If I ever stop by here again I'd take the food to go."}
{"text":"Simple: they gave us a buzzer to let us know when our foods ready, waited for our food for 20 mins almost.. Guy looked at my brother and i & put food on the counter..
Of course it could be anyones food & the buzzer did not vibrate.. 10 mins later the worker told us that the food on the counter was ours..

Ugh first off whats the point of giving us a buzzer if you dont wanna put it to use?
Secondly! Our food was already halfway cold when we opened it cus it took so long cus he didnt even let us know in any gesture it was ours"}
{"text":"My BF kept telling me how good the chicken is here so, we went. Not impressed at all. 

1. Not many options
2. Chicken is below average if you ask me
3. Overpriced for what they offer. 
4. Service sucked. I had a gift card and the cashier had never seen one before. 
5. Have absolutely no desire to go back.

It was busy in there ...  Not my cup of tea or should I say not my bucket of chicken"}
{"text":"Probably the nicest Jollibee I've ever been to. It's a Two-fer! You get Red Ribbon Bakery and Jollibee in one location if you have a hankering for Filipino dessert after your calorie bomb fried chicken meal. Food is up to par for a Jolibee. My kids love that you can get fried chicken and rice or spaghetti Instead of the standard KFC sides. They also love the peach pie dessert. I love the Westside location!"}
{"text":"Jollibee wait is no longer crazy  

I went back yesterday at 5:40pm and the tent is now completely gone. Wonder if it is my review (jk) or maybe the tents will be used for the new branch coming up in Mississauga next month. 

the wait time in line is 20 mins and it moved pretty fast. max line up: 20 mins and less than 10 mins of ordering and getting the food.  however the later it got, the longer the line at 845pm as the line tripled in size. 

I got a bucket of chicken this time: four original and two spicy. The chicken was so good and i find the Original is better than spicy :) not crazy about spicy as it is simply sprinkled powder on the chicken. too spicy. 

As there is no more tent as of this week, bring an umbrella or cover in case it rains lol

Tables are scarce. Wonder if Jollibee can offer outside seating for the summer"}
{"text":"This Jollibee location is the slowest, inefficient, unproductive \"fastfood\" I have ever seen! I came in to get lunch and there was only one counter open and only one person taking the order, preparing the order, processing payment and bagging the orders while about 5-6 people are waiting in line. Then I ordered a Spam sandwich and I was told they do not have the bread that day. Uhm, they had a few sandwiches on the menu (spam, chicken, tuna, egg mayo and corned beef sandwiches) so maybe they want to cross those off for that day. Then I ordered the Chicken Joy meal. It took 10 minutes before I got my order and when I asked for my drink I was told I did not have a drink. Uhm, it was a MEAL I ordered so I did not understand. They did not even bother to explain or ask me if I wanted to pay additional for a drink ....manager and everyone need to be replaced by faster, more efficient and friendlier (and smarter) employees."}
{"text":"Waited about 1hr and 20min from start to getting my food. The service is good and it's clean and the actual restaurant isn't too packed. They manage the large amount of customers pretty well.

Chicken was really good. So was the spaghetti, burger, pie, and the pineapple drink. Not a fan of the gravy though.

Prices are kind of high but that's expected. Food is pretty worth the price :)"}
{"text":"This store is dirty and the employee that took my order tonight couldn't well communicate...she look like she's on some kind of medication...and when I got my order it was for a different table..and thee are my people!!!! How embarrassing...bad service ! Dirty place!"}
{"text":"My Caucasian friend spotted the sign while passing by Maryland Blvd. He had severe craving for it (he last ate one in LA a few years ago). So we found the place for lunch the following day.

I was trying to keep an open mind but I don't go fast foods as a rule. I feel they are tasteless, salty, greasy, boring, and not worth the value.

I believe I had the Palabok Fiesta. The thin rice noodle covered by the sauce. I could not decipher what's in the sauce. It's a brown paste, with a 2 slices of boiled eggs on top. 

The taste was boring and bland and salty. The portion was so pathetically small that I swallowed in 2 bites, for $5 (I chose not to include drink).

My friend had burger steak. It actually came with a side cole slaw too. It was salisbury steak with mushroom sauce. I had a bite....  Wow! The cole slaw tasted OK in a Filipino fast foods chain. The dollar bite size corned beef burger... well. It's canned corned beef put inside a dinner roll. I can do the same at home if I really want to go for this.

So diners, if you really want to live an American life (Madonna, hear this), it's an option. It's too pricey for my simple taste."}
{"text":"My first Filipino fast food place I've been to. Not bad. $1 corn beef or spam burgers. I bought 24 of them for my friends before going out. This was cheaper than going to a lunch buffet at the Wynn.

I actually wished they had one of these in Chicago. The employees were really nice; always smiling. If I had to guess, I think they came straight from the Philippines."}
{"text":"My good friend Dennis Schulz who accompanied me to this place put it best.
\"TV dinner food made by Filipino people.\""}
{"text":"Before I start this, let me be clear that I didn't wait in line and I am not Filipino(no nostalgic factor), my girlfriend lined up for it and even she doesn't know what was her motivation.

That being said, this is GREAT Fried Chicken!!

We got two buckets(6pcs each) of them and I finished almost a whole bucket .. by myself!
The batter was very light and crispy and the chicken tasted good, the only downside is that chicken pieces had a little too much fat for my liking. The peach and mango pie was pretty good too.

I mean, the food is not two-hours-waiting-in-line good of course, but it's not just hype either. I can see myself going back there once the hype is over and I am looking for good Fried Chicken in the area, this blows KFC/Popeyes chicken by miles!"}
{"text":"The chicken is comparable to KFC and the gravy has a nice peppery flavour. The sweetness of the spaghetti compliments the saltiness of the meat. However, on its own it is a little bit much."}
{"text":"Always 15-20 minute wait for the infamous chicken joy everytime we come/dine here to think they know it's rush hour...always giving them a chance yet ended up disappointed...."}
{"text":"Just because I miss home, and been craving for Jollibee palabok, spaghetti, Pinoy burger and of course Chicken Joy!"}
{"text":"Eating their the spaghetti was nostalgic as it reminded me of the times I had it in Hong Kong as a child. It's a little on the sweeter side but it pairs perfectly with their fried chicken.


Having experienced the chicken from popular joints like Popeyes and KFC in Canada, we have grown accustomed to the quality of the chicken and the breading. At Jollibee, the breading is PERFECT, the spicy flavor is actually spicy AND sweet, and the meat fallsright off the bone and melts in your mouth, as if their chicken was freshly slaughtered the morning of. The gravy is also good. I am very impressed with their quality of their food, and my overall dining experience at their new location (Kennedy and 401). The wait is definitely worth it!

 

I need to go back to try their burger at a time where there's no line up!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Jollibee ever since I first tried it in Virginia Beach, and have subsequently tried some California locations as well. Now I can say I've had their Las Vegas food!

The layout of each store tends to be different, but the menus mostly the same with slight variation. This location is inside a Seafood City supermarket. As such, it is a little smaller, but still has a decent number of seats. Service is friendly, but minimal given that it is a fast food joint. Prices are relatively inexpensive.

They are most known for their fried chicken, but they offer a lot of other Filipino fast food options as well. There is also a smattering of drinks and desserts, most notably (that make it stand out) pineapple juice, ube or pandan \"coolers\" with boba, and halo halo. I miss when Jollibee offered bangus, but haven't had it since many years ago in Virginia. Nonetheless, I think the food is pretty tasty and inexpensive. That combination of spicy fried chicken, rice, and gravy is so bad but so good..."}
{"text":"Unbelivable no fried chicken on a Saturday at noon (Yesterday) and a 20 minute wait!

If I knew I would be waiting so long at the drive thru I would have actually ordered chicken. Waste of my 30 minute lunch"}
{"text":"I first heard about this Filipinos fast food joint when I was in Honolulu a few weeks ago. They just opened one up in Waipahu. There was such a long line up there everyday that I didn't even bother to go there. One day while I was driving along Maryland Parkway and happened to see the big sign of Jollibee on the wall next to the Filipino super market \"Seafood City\". Since I didn't see any line up, I decided to try out this place. Surprisingly, there was no one at the counter ordering and only 4 customers eating and this was lunch time! Someone told me to try their fried chicken but I opted instead for the Palabok Fiesta because it's healthier....LOL. I was disappointed as the portions were very small. 

I guess my taste buds are not used to eating Filipino food as I found the rice noodles overcooked and not that flavorful.  I don't think I would go back there again.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but I'm not sure I want to come back unless there are no other options available. I come here mainly for the Filipino breakfast, which does the job when I'm being lazy and don't feel like cooking it. The main problem is the woman at the drive thru. She just can't get it together. Last week, she messed up my order. Today, she shorted me change. I really don't think it's that hard...?"}
{"text":"I fell in love with jollibees on one of my trips to Hawaii I found out that they are as popular in the Philippines as McDonald's is to America. 
The good/skinny
I have to say the burgers taste very different than what I am used to but man if you have an open mind you should def try it (I think) they make there burger meat using there world famous gravy (I go for the big aloha cause it has a pineapple in it) they also use a honey mustard for the sauce and the taste combo is amazing. The chicken is always perfect and taste fresh with a side of banana ketchup (has no taste of banana and is so tasty) the French fries are so good as well always taste fresh and perfect a must if you are in Las Vegas. 
The bad 
They don't offer the aloha hot dog which I loved in Hawaii I always ask just to make sure they know they should get it in. And sometimes it can take a while for food to come out but with all good food it takes time so I'm patient :-).
This place is def worth it if your foodie like me and try the ketchup you only live once."}
{"text":"This palce use to have the best fried chicken until they stopped changing the oil! I defintely can tell the difference when the oil isnt changed! I tried this 3 different times and still the same taste old frying oil taste!!! This ruined it for me otherwise it used to be good!"}
{"text":"No matter what, their food will never be worth it or better than the Jollibees in the Philippines. At least the McDonalds in the Philippines has the same recipes. Jollibee just doesnt quite taste the same. Its overpriced and it takes away from the \"fast food\" prices. I still like their boba & gravy though. Hopefully, they add on something new to their menu that drives me back whenever I go to Seafood City."}
{"text":"A must try fast food chain restaurant their spaghetti was a super bomb and the crispyliciuos chicken joy...."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! Why didn't I read reviews before coming here.

Ran into this place and decided to check it out since I was pressed for time and it was on my way, convenient and it \"looked\" decent. Took me a good while to make a decision on what to get from their drive-thru menu (should always follow my food instincts, but didn't). I ordered the two piece chicken and my side of fries. 

Service:
When I rolled up to the window, I was charged for a 3 piece, two sides! Fine. Whatever, I wasn't in the mood for an argument so I paid the darn $8. Lady at the window was very sincere about her apology in screwing up my order but never offered to fix it. 

Food:
Mother-trucker! This place takes the cake in messing up fried chicken-ROYALLY. I took the first bite and my lips looked so greasy, it looked like I over applied clear lipgloss! Moved on to the fries in hopes for them to be so awesome, they would make up for the fried chicken lard drumstick I had just bit into. Negative. Salty, stale and with an odd flavor! 

Guess I can scratch this curiosity out the way for the next time they happen to conveniently cross my path."}
{"text":"Extremely yummy! I moved here only 7 years ago from the Philippines and I go here all the time ever since! It's also extremely affordable! Get the burger steak meal and it's like 5 bucks for a full meal and SOOOOOO GOOD! it's right next to UNLV as well so I usually go here in between classes. So yummy and filling! The only thing I wish for is if they had swirly bitz (sold in the Philippines jollibee) it's like the best Mcflurry ever made! :)"}
{"text":"You gotta be in the culture to be a fan otherwise you just dont get it. 

Can't go wrong. 

Chicken is delicious, with or without the gravy.

I'm in love with the spaghetti and pancit."}
{"text":"Taste of home! We had chicken joy, spaghetti, palabok, and peach mango pie. Everything was pretty good, and the price was decent. The only thing I found that could be better was increase the number per bucket. I think each bucket contained only 6 pcs, so we ended up having to order 2 buckets (there were 5 of us) just in case. Service was pretty good. We got our food right away."}
{"text":"huge lines for overhyped food. I knew this was coming . decided to give it a shot anyways. the linesup are long but the delivery time is quiet short. the fried chicken was okay, way better options in Toronto. the pie was decent the gravy sucked bad. I wouldn't honestly come back. it wasn't bad by any means but with the numerous options in Toronto, I'll visit other establishments and also support our local businesses."}
{"text":"Like most food, you would have to have been raised on or grew up with it to really like or appreciate it...

Such is the case, with Jolibee's Fried Chicken. Just about every table had one, so the wifey and I decided to share a plate to see what all the hype was about, and I also got a peach pie because it really looked like how the old school deep fried apple pies Mc Donald's used to have waaaay back in the day(STILL searching for that to this day)

How was the chicken? The Colonel still kicks the Bee's A$$....IMHO

How was the pie? Close but no cigar....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Gave Jolibee yet another try at this location, and I'm convinced that I'm not a fan of the overly hyped Chicken Joy. Definitely no joy anywhere on that plate.

I guess if I grew up on this stuff, it would be a different story. The place is clean, and the service was good, but this Filipino fast food does not appeal to me at all. Yes, this ain't  much of a Yelp approved business, but I'm sure the Filipino community will keep Jolibee from closing up shop.

The only thing that may draw me back are their pies, which are the closest thing to Mickey D's old school Apple Pies...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"One review noted it as an \"organized chaos\"...this is spot on. I went around 12:30pm on a Sunday for reference. 

Outside: We waited in the tent outside for roughly 30 minutes. You get a number when you first get in line with some rules outlined: $60 pre-tax max, 3 buckets max, 10 burgers max, 10 pies max. When you're close to the end of the line you get a copy of the menu. I'd highly recommend looking at the menu ahead of time so there isn't much delay. In line, a person with a notepad will mark your order down. After people file out, someone will let you know when you can enter the actual building. 

Inside: Once you get inside it's not much more waiting. You hand the paper with your order to the cashier and they enter your order, you pay, and you get a buzzer. If you plan on sitting inside, look for a table as soon as you're allowed inside.

Food: The food was just like I remembered. I hadn't had Jollibee since 2016 and it was just as expected. One downside, this location doesn't have Halo-Halo."}
{"text":"Went there twice to introduce this place to my husband. I had been telling him about the food here many months ago and he definitely loved that spicy chiken joy with rice & gravy. I super love the fact that all of the food I ate there, palabok noodle, regular yum, spicy chicken joy & peach mango pie tastes exactly the same in my home country, where this Fast food restaurant originally came from. That is Globalization to the highest level. This is a filipino made fast food  restaurant that had beaten McDonald's & KFC in the market, and I could understand why, with the taste and the local ingredients and products they use, I felt I was home for a moment."}
{"text":"Not worth standing in a line for half an hour . I think the food nd the place is to hyped. I would suggest if popeyes on this 100 times better nd tasty. Just so so chicken nothing special about it. Specially when there is options like kfc , popeyes available."}
{"text":"We stopped by last night. I'm with my American husband who loves Jollibee.; unfortunately this fast food gave us DOUBLE FRIED chicken, which means old fried and re fried old chicken. Very embarrassing experience for him. This is poor management and cheating customers is illegal. Watch out guys if the meat is harder and darker, it was old and re battered... very bad"}
{"text":"Jolibee has some pretty delicious filipino based food. They are known for their fried chicken which imo, really good. I also LOVE the spaghetti. Its really sweet and flavorful."}
{"text":"Jollibee has been open for a few months now, and finally had the lines died down a bit, thus saying there's still a line. I've been here twice now, and have both times opted for their spaghetti and 1 piece chicken combo ~$9. People come out of this place in buckets of chicken and spaghetti, it's crazy! Their chicken is definitely a lot more crispier and spicier than KFC and even Popeyes I would say. Definitely come check this place out if the way is less than 20 min."}
{"text":"Jollibee oh so popular because it's big in the Philippines. Many people eat this because it is a fast food place that's affordable. You get what you pay for. The only reason I can give this place three stars is because their Filipino spaghetti is very Filipino original with the chopped hotdogs. If you want good chicken, I'd say there are a lot of other options out for you. If you want the Filipino atmosphere with plenty of chismis and people staring at you, then this is your spot. I also like the fact that the Filipino channel is on all the time."}
{"text":"They call it a fastfood, but the service is way too damn slow. Even the drive through is too slowwww!


Chicken is good though, but is it worth the long wait? Nuh-uh"}
{"text":"Worth the wait? We got lucky. My family game on a Tuesday at 5:05PM and waited approx. 10 mins from line to food in hand. (We were surprised too)
The lines were very efficient outside as there was a designated line up area and workers that took our orders so we were ready when we went in.

We wanted to try everything but focused on the popular dishes. We got the 6pc chicken combo with  a large spaghetti and 3 peach/mango pies. We also added the Palabok Fiesta as it was recommended by someone in line with us.
I was impressed by the tasty, meatiness of the chicken. The chicken was juicy and batter was crispy. The spaghetti was a bit on the sweet side which is not to my taste.
I was presently surprised the Palabok Fiesta had perfectly cooked vermicelli noodles and a very tasty sauce.

We were really impressed by the speed of service and hospitable servers.

If we are in the area, will definitely try to swing by...if the lines are reasonable."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out that there was a Jollibee near where I was staying at in Vegas. My mom is filipino so, I'm very familiar with a lot of the filipino dishes.

Jollibee is honestly a watered down version of filipino food. It wasn't terrible, it was just...okay. My mom order the palabok & she didn't really care for it. The noodles we're thin, the same noodles that she uses in her pancit. I'm accustomed to palabok with the thicker noodles but, that's my preference. I ordered the burger steak with rice. It wasn't bad. I really liked the gravy with the rice. The meat well, it's your standard fast food frozen beef patty. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad. Don't expect super authentic filipino food at a fast food setting. This spot would be perfect for someone who's never had filipino food before & wants to take baby steps into the cuisine."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken Ive had. I can't even compare it to KFC, Popeyes, or Brown's.
This place is so popular in the Philippines, and are slowly moving East.
There's only one location in Las Vegas, but much more in California.
They serve Fried Chicken with rice or fries, they have burgers, they have pancit palabok, they have noodle soup, they have bubble shakes, its just pure heaven in the fast food race.
They definitely need to move faster East and open locations in Chicago."}
{"text":"Jollibee = fried chicken. & that's about it.
Everything else is too salty or too sweet. Meals & desserts, respectively.
The TFC they play gets pretty old, but I think that's just me.
Oh, the tocino breakfast is pretty good."}
{"text":"Very glad I dont have to go to seafood city just to get this... Although it would be nice if chowking was also part of the little shop with red ribbon and jollibee. It feels incomplete.  The service is nice , the food is good . It's actually better quality than the seafood city location!"}
{"text":"on the most recent trip to vegas it was decided that Jollibee was for lunch.  I lost the vote and followed everyone else.  We have Jollibee in San Diego and its not like i have never been there.

This Jollibee was new and the menu board were flat screen tvs. It was crowded despite going on Monday Lunchtime.  Prices seemed a little higher, but i got the Palabok and Chicken Combo.  I asked for White Meat Chicken, since the menu said there was an extra charge for it.  The cashier told me they ran out.  Always happens...how strange.  I a chicken leg and boy was it crispy.  The Palabok was greasy, but I still finished it.

If you haven't seen this location, its worth a visit."}
{"text":"Jollibee has been my favorite fast food ever since I was a little girl.  My mom used to take me to Jollibee for my birthday - so it's quite memorable to me.  

The Jollibee in Las Vegas was the first Jollibee I have ever visited outside the Philippines.  My first visit was a while back (not so sure about the date maybe 5 years ago), but I go to this place at least once or twice a year.  

My favorite food in Jollibee: Chicken Joy with spaghetti, Peach mango pie
Other than my favorites, I think everything else is OK."}
{"text":"Came here on a gloomy Saturday afternoon before 2pm assuming the rush would be over. Boy was I wrong. There was a queue in the parking lot and we waited over 30 mins before bring able to get in the store. Once you're inside the service is speedy so that's Not the problem. They give you an order pager once you've paid and the store and washrooms are amazingly Clean. 

Food wise, we got a bucket of 6 pieces with half regular and half spicey. And since the spaghetti looked appealing we got a single order of that too. 

The spaghetti was sweet and had sufficient toppings. Totally reminds me of the Asian style spaghetti. 

As for the chicken, it was hot and crispy with a Moist and juicy inside. I think the clear winner is the gravy sauce. With every bite i couldn't resist dipping in to some of that gravy.  I'll come back again but probably not something I'd eat regularly. Would love to try their burger and pies next when the lines are shorter"}
{"text":"This place is located inside Seafood City. Even though it is Filipino fast food, the food is still good. My favorite is the family meals. They are big enough to feed a family of four. If I was just ordering for myself, my go to meal would be the spaghetti and fried chicken. I also add ketchup in my spaghetti to make it sweeter. You can't really go wrong anything on their menu. It goes get busy and it might be hard to find tables to sit at. You might want to look around and then figure out if you want eat there or take it to go."}
{"text":"I heard about Jollibee by reading a Harvard Business Review case on the company and was interested to try it out for myself.  I was surprised to discover two locations in Vegas.  I gave the Seafood City location a try.

I knew it was a Filipino fast food joint that had food that catered to that demographic.  Since I'm an \"white-washed\" Pacific Islander, my taste in food leans more towards a traditional American taste than the islands....so, I knew I was in for an adventure.

I decided to sample a little bit of everything.  I had the Shanghai Rolls, 99 cent Corned Beef Sandwich, 99 cent French Fries, and a Champ Burger.  To wash it down I had a bottle of Water.  Since I ordered to eat in the restaurant, I was issued a number and waited for my order to be delivered.  The order came out in two batches since it took a while to cook my Champ Burger.

The Corned Beef Sandwich was very small....about the size of a Slider.  It didn't have much flavor to it....kind of bland to me.

The Shanghai Rolls were very good.  They were tiny, pinky sized Rolls that had the texture of Lumpia.  They were pretty good but you didn't get much for 99 cents.

The French Fries were just ok, nothing special.

The Champ Burger was a mess.  It was very sloppy with the Mayo and Ketchup running down the sides of the Burger.  It has a different taste to it....I don't know what it is....but it doesn't taste like a regular Burger.  I didn't like it at all.

The joint was really busy and had at least 10 people in line during my entire visit, which was around 2 pm.  That's pretty impressive.

Will I return?  Probably not, it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the ube pearl (boba) cooler drink. It was bad!!! The boba was mushy and the ube tasted nothing like ube. I had one sip and threw it away. $4 down the drain..."}
{"text":"Got a 3 pc meal and spaghetti to go. I got back to my hotel and noticed they didn't give me gravy. I didnt know I was supposed to ask for it, I figured it came as a staple. The food was great though, and portions were more than adequate. Will go here again, just have to remember to ask for gravy."}
{"text":"Comes with a hefty price tag. Not worth lining up and wait for hours. Peach mango pie is the best. Their fried chicken is crispilicious!!"}
{"text":"Slowly but surely becoming a fan of this Filipino Fast Food Chain. 

Service is friendly and very professional at this particular location.

Their fried chicken and white rice is my main reason for each of my visits.  

Jollibee is a unique fast food restaurant for Filipinos to call their own, Filipino traditional cuisine is based from array of stews to bake goodies from Spanish to Chinese influence so its hard to replicate that authentic taste in a fast food kitchen environment.

Though Jollibee does not fulfill those Filipino taste buds for most from the reviews posted, I would contribute the criticism due to implanted template from of their child hood taste buds produced from their mother's home cooking that causes the steer of complaints, Jollibee in my opinion takes Filipino classic foods and satisfies a quick fix at a fast food type of restaurant like any other food establishment with a mascot as a logo, Jollibee takes simple and cheap food into another level."}
{"text":"It's good for fast and cheap food, but it's a put off eating at the restaurant sometimes. Every time I come here, there's always a big group of flies flying around. It's super annoying. 

Also, since the workers most likely don't want to work there, they're a bit rude. I guess ordering in English instead of Tagalog was a big sign of make fun of me was put on my forehead, since they kept laughing at the fact that I was probably \"white washed\" 

In retaliation, I thanked them in Tagalog and sat nearby talking in Tagalog to my best friend."}
{"text":"If you want really quick Filipino fast food, Jollibee is the place to go. They serve fried chicken, burgers, burger steak, and Filipino spaghetti. They also have a life sized statue of the great Jollibee himself, so don't be afraid to take a picture with the bee! 

The fried chicken is very good. If you like spicy, try going for the spicy fried chicken. They will put a tiny red flag on the chicken to indicate that it is a spicy piece. Honestly, it isn't even really spicy. I prefer the spicy chicken over the regular fried chicken. 

There are usually a lot of people in the restaurant, and waiting can take a long time sometimes. They give you a buzzer while you wait, which will buzz when the food is ready. Prices are affordable and the quality of food is somewhat consistent."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5

*Soley based on the food as I did not dine in or wait in line...thank god!*

My parents informed me that they were going to try and get to Jollibee early to get a ticket. I'm like aight just make sure you bring home some chicken and gravy!

I've actually never had Jollibee before and I've never been back home, so I don't have the same connection as my parents or as the majority of people trekking down there. 

I've never been but OBVZ I've heard about it. I had a Jollibee radio when I was little!

Anyways, my parents got the family combo pack that included 6 piece chicken, spaghetti and peach mango pies (33.99). The spaghetti tastes like literally the epitome of Filipino spaghetti. Sweet and bland. I've had better versions from Filipino restaurants in the Peel region. I've even had better at family parties lol. However, with that being said. It wasn't terrible and I didn't mind it too much. I'd say 3/5. The chicken and gravy thooooo! The gravy was evvverything! 5/5 for gravy! I wanted to eat a second piece of chicken just to have more gravy but I was stuffed lol. The crispness and breading was on point. I preferred the skin over the actual meat lol.  I'd give it a 3.5/5 because of the skin. I did force myself to try the peach mango pie. It didn't intrigue me at all cuz I am not a fan of fruity pies unless it's apple. Well I had to try it. I can see why people would like it but ultimately it wasn't for me. The crispy pastry is nice and the filling is not too sweet buuut, it just didn't blow my mind. 2/5. That's more biased though because like I said, I don't like fruity pies.

Shoutout to my parents cuz I didn't have to wait in line or wait till next year to try Jollibee lol."}
{"text":"Good fast food Philipino style at a fair price. Friendly people working there and will be back..."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Jollibee's after reading great things about it. Although I was wary not to buy into the hype too much. How spectacular could a fast food place be after all? The answer is that it wasn't amazing, wasn't bad, somewhere in between.

As others have said they run a very organized and efficient operation. They must've had at least 15 people working from what I saw. At 9pm on a weekday I only had to wait 25 minutes. Much better than the hours and hours others have mentioned waiting when they first opened. They are more costly than your typical fast food joint.

The food:
Fried chicken (spicy) was tender, juicy, and had a nice kick of heat. The batter was light and it wasn't too crispy.

Aloha burger was a bit on the salty side but the slice of pineapple in there helped balance it out. The patty size was similar to that of a quarter pounder. Tasty burger overall.

Spaghetti had nice flavour (some sweetness to it) but I didn't particularly like the meat. It was slices of processed meat, almost like hot dog. The texture of the spaghetti was slightly hard and brittle.

Mango peach pie was great. The dough was perfectly golden and crispy. The filling was (not overly) sweet, warm, fruity goodness.

Pineapple juice was sweet and refreshing. Washes down the food nicely. 

I wouldn't go out of my way or wait hours to come here but they do have different food choices (e.g palabok, burger steak) that you don't see in most other franchise fast food places."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Fried chicken, yum burgers, peach mango pies, pancit palabok, peach mango pies, and pineapple thirst quenchers. 

Ppl giving bad ratings due to wait times are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Jollibee is close to where I live, open until midnight, has a grocery store right next to it, cheap and fast service... what more can I ask? Oh yeah, their bundle specials are back. On Tuesdays you get family size spaghetti and 6 pc chicken, Wednesday 2 buckets of 6 pc chicken and Thursdays family size palabok and 6 pc chicken for $15.99. That my friend, is deals you can't pass up. My favorite is defiantly their signature dish, spicy chicken. Spaghetti and palabok are also very good. Their yum buger is my second favorite here, the sauce inside is ahhhhhhmazing. Go here if you want something fast, inexpensive and satisfies your cravings."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Jollibee I have ever been to and I have been to a lot. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 

I have been here multiple times and every single time I have gone here they NEVER fail to mess up my order. 

Today, I went back with an open mind willing to give them another chance, but once again without a fail they messed up my order. I order a 2 piece burger steak with 2 sides (fries and rice) and the cashier proceeded to give me a messily put together box of  the 2 piece burger steak. When I asked her about the rice and mentioned to her that I had ordered for both rice and fries and proceeded to tell me that I only ordered the fries when I specifically told her I wanted both. The manager comes shortly after and proceeds to charge me MORE because it was my fault that I messed up my order? Despite the fact that I said countless times that I specifically mentioned both. As if that was not already inconvenient she hastily scoops rice and dumps it into the container and tosses it on the counter as if it was MY fault that I forgot to put rice. As if that wasn't already a problem the fries were extremely soggy and the meat was undercooked and barely had any sauce.

Will never be coming here again. This place is a disgrace to all Jollibee's."}
{"text":"Should be a - Star.burger was gross. dont know what Was in it, did not Looks or taste like any beef i have ever se en. You would have to be crazey to eat  there  reson for one Star, Cant post without."}
{"text":"The chicken bucket was juicy as always, happy about that. Seemed like everything we're freshly cooked. The spaghetti was excellent! And the peach mango pie was just right and wasn't too sweet, was also freshly made. Over all a really good dinner tonight."}
{"text":"By far the best friggin gravy and chicken skin ever..  The only downside was that it's pretty expensive for the portion size, and if you only like white meat like myself, then be prepared to wait 20 minutes or so.."}

{"text":"I love the foods... specially the spaghetti and chicken joy...

Dont forget the apple pie and halo-halo..."}
{"text":"sometimes you just need some filipino fried chicken with some rice. besides that, nothing else is worth getting"}
{"text":"mmm! halo halo :)

Came to this area on the Eastside one evening at Maryland Pkwy looking for a boba place. When I saw Jollibee I knew I wanted halo-halo instead! what? can't a girl change her mind? LoL! For those unfamiliar with the Jollibee restaurants they are a Philippines-based chain known for its burgers, fried chicken, spaghetti & Filipino dishes. But we didn't have any of that I mentioned, instead, we had halo-halo and it was delicious! Not all halo-halo are made equally... some do not taste as good.

The fast food restaurant is right next to the Seafood City grocery market with the 'bee' greeting you at that entrance but it also has its own entrance from outside. Just like any fast food place you walk up to the counter and place your order and your receipt # will be called when food is ready. The staff was friendly and someone kept the dining area clean at all times.

We came on Thanksgiving evening... it was around 9:00p and the place was packed, young and old! wth... no one cooked turkey that day and decided to eat at Jollibee? Anyway, a couple of seats down from us there was this cute little girl, I'd say she was around 5 years old and, well, you know, Filipinos love to sing...  she was singing the chorus line of 
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)

... then my mind kept singing that song all night after we left :)

{"text":"Chickenjoy is always good. My kiddo loves their gravy. Stay away from the palabok, it's not edible. Head over to the grill place, theirs is much better. Staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Being a proud Filipino, seeing a Jollibee is akin to seeing the Golden Arches for Asians.  Although I do like me some McDonald's every once in a while, I try to stay away from too much fast food.  Ruins the palette!  Not to mention the diet.

Jollibee is on the average with every other fast food joint in and around the US of A.  It does strike a chord for many Filipinos stranded in the 9th Island that is Las Vegas.  The memories are a welcome to most, and to food for me at least is just OK.

We visit Jollibee when the family feels like we get too American.  Gotta remember your roots!  Ironically, Jollibee is as Americanized Filipino as you can get!  Flavors are totally changed to a more Westernized taste bud.  For crying out loud, Jollibee's website it located at www.Jollibeeusa.com!  That said, they do serve some decent dishes.  

Jollibee serves breakfast, as well as a main menu that goes for lunch and dinner.  Ok, breakfast...is not your health-conscious oatmeal and egg whites.  You got your garlic fried rice (breakfast of Filipino champions & vampire hunters), fried egg, a slice of tomato for good measure, with your choice of pork, corned beef, beef tapa, milkfish belly, pork sausage (which looks more like a hot dog), or my beloved SPAM.  MMMMM...tasty!  Please be sure to have lots of liquid with your breakfast here, salt city baby!  But for some reason, comforting.  Although my mom does a much better breakfast with her leftover bacon-fat and garlic fried rice, scrambled eggs, and Uncle Louie's (Maui's own!) Portuguese Sausage.  *DROOL*  I miss my Mommy.

Jollibee's main menu is very, very varied.  Typical stuff you would find in a fast food burger place, but some curveballs thrown in for good measure.  You got your hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hot dogs and your fries.  But add on their Chickenjoy to the menu.  Fried chicken yeah!  Along with mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, and of course..white rice.  Wait, there's more!  Want some spaghetti?  They got it at Jollibee too!  Filipino spaghetti is the norm, but the difference is the meat sauce is made sweeter with the addition of a nice dose of sugar.  Ooh, my glucose levels.  What, not Asian enough for you?  Jollibee also serves up classics as Pancit Palabok (aka 'Fiesta Noodles'), as well as a nice crispy bangus fish plate.

Food's not bad, I usually end up getting a spaghetti and Chickenjoy combo plate.  Did I mention the gravy for some reason is really good?  I'd probably put it on a shoe (a clean one) and gnaw on it.  The burgers are decent, but I've had better pancit in other places.  But I warn you diabetics, choose wisely!  Me thinks a lot of their food has added sugar in it.  Sweet!

Jollibee also has some dessert offerings, mote notably their Halo-Halo sweet treat.  I like theirs because they add a scoop of vanilla and ube ice cream on top.  I just wish they added more fruit, more ice, and less sugar.  Plus come on, the price is a bit much!  About $5 for a large one.

So if you're new to ethnic food, or want to impress that Filipino date of yours, don't go to Jollibee!  Ha Ha!  Go eat at some real, authentic Filipino establishment!  If you're craving a quick fix of Asian fast food then Jollibee might just be the ticket.  And take a pic with the Jollibee mascot, all the other Asians do!  Although he does creep me out a bit.  Damn you, Stephen King and IT...scared me off of clowns for good."}
{"text":"Now being a proud Filipino person, I gotta say I love my people.  My peeps.  My bretheren.  But Filipino fast food?  Not so much love.  Jollibee does some things right, but some things not so right.  Damn...can you say over-processed food!?  

Jollibee is of course, the Filipino equivalent of your American McDonald's or Burger King.  It was created when settlers from the lost tribes of the Philippine forests ventured to the soil of modern society and proclaimed that the world was their oyster...errr...balot.  Okay, fine, fine.  Jollibee got its start in Daly City, CA by trying to give Filipino-American families a taste of home that was long forgotten.  Apparently my Nanay and Tatay both missed the taste of the PI with burgers, chicken, and sweet spaghetti!  And the joy of that strange red and white bee buzzing around.

Honestly, Jollibee is about as Filipino as I am to looking like an Asian Brad Pitt (though on most days I'm closer to Jo Koy).  Close...but no cigar.  This is Filipino trying to attract caucasians at it's finest.  No offense to caucasians (especially you - Most Desirable Woman of 2012 Jennifer Lawrence), but not much Filipino influence is to be had here.  It is for all-intentional purposes, dumbed down for American audiences.  Which is a bit of a disappointment because real Filipino food is bursting with real flavor!  Patis here, bagoong there, jufran here, 'all-purpose' sauce there...pork EVERYWHERE...that is real Filipino food.  Jollibee, ai sos, I don't know what to tell you.

Of course I eat at Jollibee occasionally because my kids somehow like it here.  My little one goes, \"This is how they eat in the Philippines?  Yummy!\"  Now I've never been back to my homeland, but I'm 110% sure this isn't how most folks eat there.  I've seen the PI episodes for both No Reservations and Bizarre Foods so I know!  Tony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern cannot be deceived!    

Going to the food.  For fast foods standards it's OK.  Nothing special for the most part, but somehow comforting at the same time.  It is nice to see Filipinos congregating in the same place considering what a melting pot Las Vegas is.  It's kinda like eating at the communal table.  Except we are all partaking in a lot of sodium and artificial flavoring.  But who said MSG was bad for you, eh?  Jollibee's menu is all over the place!  They got burgers, fried chicken, fried fish, Italian spaghetti, palabok, hot dogs...it's nuts!  Then of course you got sides like waffle fries, mashed potatoes and gravy, and white rice.  Filipino, right?  And who can forget the creative names for some of their food?  Fried chicken is called 'Chickenjoy',  and there's burgers called the 'Amazing Aloha' (it has pineapple in it) and the 'Big Yum!'  (I have never had it but I am assuming it is BIG and YUMMY).  Gotta love the marketing.

If you've had fast food before you know what to expect from Jollibee.  It all tastes strangely the same.  I will give them credit for their Chickenjoy though, it's pretty darn good!  Especially when it's fresh out of the fryer.  Something about getting a side of gravy to dip your fried chicken in is very appealing to me.  Add a side of mashed potatoes and corn and I'm in.  Jollibee Chickenjoy rivals that of your big chain fried chicken joints.  Masarap!

Jollibee does breakfast as well, and I think that this is actually better than their lunch and dinner menu.  What Filipino doesn't like garlic fried rice with a sunny-side-up fried egg and your choice of meat?  Especially when your choice of meat includes pork tocino, fried milkfish belly, corned beef, or SPAM?  Lovely!  Bring on some shoyu, Filipino ketchup, a Lipitor, lots of water and I'm all set!  Thanks for the memories.  Sure beats a friggin' Egg McMuffin!

Jollibee does dessert as well, boba drinks that they call 'Pearl Coolers' (UBE=YUM), peach and mango or banana pies (that look just like the ones from McDonald's), and the ubiquitous Halo-Halo.  International dessert of the Philippines!  It's kinda like fruit cocktail mixed with coconut shavings, condensed milk, shaved ice, and topped with a dollop of ube and vanilla ice cream.  This one is a bit sweet for my liking though, wish there was more fruit, and less milk.  It is kinda pricey though at around $5 for a large.  But unfortunately the large only feeds piggy ol' me.  

Overall it's an OK experience.  And yes, the cashiers at Jollibee can speak English as well as Ilocano or Tagalog and are very friendly.  If you go in here and think all Filipino people eat like this then you my friend have no clue!  Ok well maybe some of us eat like that.  Most of us rather be at home with a pot of chicken adobo or fish head sinigang or kalding (goat) calderetta simmering on the stove.  Just saying.  Now that's MASARAP!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype over the chicken when there's better options like Popeyes. The burgers are a sad joke and I've tasted far better chicken throughout the city. I wouldn't even recommend waiting 30 minutes in line for this place. But if you do dego, get the peach mango pie or burger steak! Everything else is either mediocre or below average."}
{"text":"I've been to Jollibee many times- Cali, Philippines, and here. It's all just Jollibee to me. If you're unfamiliar with the food, you'll probably enjoy the experience since it's very different from other fast food places. I don't really like the burgers; I always get Chicken Joy with rice or the spaghetti. I really like Filipino spaghetti so I enjoy this. The palabok is alright too. It's fast food so you can't expect too much. If you want something a little better, order the arroz caldo or palabok from the Red Ribbon counter right next to Jollibee.

I always order halo-halo from Jollibee. I just went there for it last night. I can go to other Filipino restaurants when I crave halo-halo but I always go here because I know what to expect and it's always consistent.

With that said, their customer service is the worst. They always forget stuff on orders and just generally lack friendliness. A girl on Yelp mentioned they were rude to her and she thought it was because she ordered in English. First of all, this shouldn't matter. But I can confirm they are rude to all people. It doesn't matter if you are speaking in English or Tagalog, they act like they can't hear you."}
{"text":"2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #2

Jollibee got the honors for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  They say pictures are worth a 1000 words. Well, when we walked into Jollibee, Bam! In our face was a beautiful sight...a poster of a perfectly made cup of Halo-Halo. For about $5, I was hoping we got exactly what the picture demonstrated...ube ice cream, flan, sweetened condensed milk, red beans, green jelly, and coconut packed in shave ice.  I think a little ube syrup was even added just for show (see pictures).  Our Halo-Halo tasted as good as expected. And with the Vegas heat that evening, our dessert only tasted that much better. Our Halo-Halo was sweet, cool, and had enough of the minimum ingredients to keep me satisfied until our next challenge.  So far, I'm a fan of Jollibee's Halo Squared.  My only issue...I wish there was more flan and some legit ube (not ice cream).

PS: For an appetizer before our Halo-Halo Challenge, I tried their Beef Tenders (Tapa).  This was basically seasoned and caramelized beef steak, eggs, and rice.  So good and a perfect quick meal before any Halo-Halo Challenge.

{"text":"This is my favorite Filipino restaurant, the food is always fresh and it always taste good when I eat there. Their chicken joy and mango peach pie is to die for. It is delicious. The best days to go there are during the week days, the wait is not as long as it is on the weekends. I would totally recommend this restaurant to people who wants to try Filipino food."}
{"text":"This is the first and only Jollibee I've ever been to. It's conveniently located inside of Seafood City on Maryland Parkway. First off, this place is always busy with people. No matter what time of day I've gone there, they always have costumers.

Pros:
1. Yummy fried chicken!
2. Delish Spaghetti
3. Orders are taken and filled quickly. 
4. The cashier person has always taken my order with a smile and was friendly.

Cons:
1. Always super busy.
2. At times, there is no place to sit, so I've had to take my order to go.
3. Tables aren't always cleaned in a timely matter.

My experience with this place has been overall a good one. No major complaints that would ever cause me to never come back. I think if you like fried chicken, you should at least try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"Waited a couple of months till the line up died down. Went here last Wednesday and waited for about 20 mins (from the line to picking up our order). Chicken joy is crispy, tender and juicy. Spaghetti is good (satisfied my chilhood nostalgia). Yum burger is a bit on a dry side. The palabok seems like its lacking sauce but once you mix it, its just about right. Peach mango pie is awesome as well. Dough is a bit crispy. Mango and peach filling combination is very tasty.
 
We'll definitely going back here."}
{"text":"This review is just for the halo halo! Last night we went and bought $10 halo halo at a restaurant. We were highly disappointed! So today we needed a do-over. My sister decided to go to Jollibee for some halo halo. The halo halo here is amazingggggg and a great price! Perfect for hot weather!"}
{"text":"it took them 30 minutes to cook a 2 pc chicken meal....that is not past pood....."}
{"text":"I am not a cheap person. but my concern is even their smallest gravy they charge you. I believe there is no more free stuff thing here especially in Las Vegas, but i also ordered a burger and which they said they do not have dressing for it, and then I asked if I could ask an extra small gravy in exchange for that burger without dressing, (I also bought a bucket of chickenjoy and of course the gravy they give you will not be enough for everything) but they said they cannot give me that extra gravy. I do not know if even that liquid gravy is included in their inventory. I just laughed, because I was thinking if it was their friends or relatives who will ask for extra gravy, what do you think? will they say they cannot have extra gravy?? no. I am sure they will just hand them extra gravy for no charge. haha
keep up ur bad customer service on how you answer the questions of customers. 
ang yayabang pa ng dating ng mga crew. kala mo kung sino. haha"}
{"text":"I have heard about Jollibee for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it out today.  A friend had told me that it was like the Filipino version of McDs and KFC combined with some traditional Filipino staples thrown in the mix.  And yep, that is what I thought when I saw the menu.

We had the fried chicken and the spaghetti today.  The fried chicken was tasty and I really liked the gravy to dip it in.  Yum.  The spaghetti was really different since it had cheese on top, a sweet tomato sauce, and some hot dog pieces all mixed together.  I know it sounds super weird, but it was actually good, in a strange way.  

It was a cheap meal too. For 2 adult meals and a kid's meal the total was only $16.  Not too shabby for lunch.  I wish I was more hungry because there were a lot of fun looking desserts to try.  Maybe next time...And there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Jollibees leaves me a bit perplexed.  I came in looking for a unique ethnic dining experience.  I left with root beer, a piece of fried chicken and sweet spaghetti with hot dogs and ham in the sauce.  I'm not saying it was bad.  Just not what I expected.  Sure, I could have ordered something more like what I was expecting.  Something with more Asian or Island influence.  But I honeslty did not know what any of it was.  I should not let that scare me and I usually don't.  I do enjoy trying new things.  But that is after some previously obtained knowledge.  I know very little about Philipino food culture.  So I went with what was familiar to me.  Fried chicken and spaghetti.  The chicken was not the best I've had.  It was not terribly crispy.  And the spaghetti was like something I would expect a child to eat.  Sweet and full of hot dogs.  That being said, I actually really did enjoy the spaghetti for what it was.  To pay around $6 or $7 for a drink, a pice of chicken and a scoop of spaghetti seemed too much.  And the restaurant was terribly hot.  Their air unit must have gone out.  The tables were warm to the touch and there were noisy fans all over the place.  I don't place any blame on the owners or management for this.  I just warn everybody out there in Yelplandia that it may be uncomfortably hot in the Jollibees on West Sahara if you go in during the summer."}
{"text":"Yes!  The McDonalds of the Philippines (food/people...etc)!  LOL, all my fellow Pinoy's, you know what I'm talking about.  Anyways, although this is a food place, let me recommend the Boba Tea!  It is delicious!  Probably the best I've tasted in a LONG time!"}
{"text":"Tonight we came here to try hoping the line up will be short.  Luckily we only waited for about 25mins outside.  The order still takes about 10 to 15 mins.  We ordered a combo of six pieces bucket original non spicy chicken, family size spaghetti and 3 peach pies along with pineapplr drinks.  The pineapple drinks was very refreshing.  Seem like they make with fresh pineapple.  The chicken is crispy, however I find lack of flavour.  I did not see any herbs or pepper on the chicken skin compared to KFC.  Maybe because I choose the non spicy version, need to find out.  I personally prefer Popeye Chicken.  The spaghetti seem to be unique and I find it tasty.  However that's just my opinion and not everyone agree.  The peach pie is surprisingly good compared to McDonald's apple pie.  Overall the restaurant offer variety of food from chicken, spaghetti to burgers.  I would come again if line up is not required."}
{"text":"Think this was my first time ever lining up for 30 minutes for fast food ever.  BUT you know what, it's still worth it. This location management has done a great job controlling lineup w umbrellas provided for sunny days, water for everyone that needed it!! Showing menu during lineup and ordering prior getting into the establishment. 
I was able to find seats easily once I got in. Food didn't take long at all & Kudos again to the management who organized the team well. 
Will go back when there's no lineup."}
{"text":"Finally a Jollibee closer to where I'm at! Faves include the spaghetti and crispy chickenjoy. The palabok used to be really good, now it seems to be suffering from cost-cutting measures with measley toppings and dilluted sauce. Why mess with a good thing? The burgers are okay but nothing compared to the real deal I've tasted in Manila and for the price it leaves me wanting more with substance and quality. Overall a good (and clean) place to go when craving Filipino-type fast food."}
{"text":"Was finally able to try this Filipino staple after several failed attempts. 2 weeks since opening, there are still lineups and despite the poor weather, we still had to wait about 1.5 hours. Thankfully they have covered tents set up while you wait and honestly, the line moves as fast as possible considering the amount of traffic they get per day. Due to demand, every person can purchase a maximum of $50 worth of food before taxes. 

I ordered a 6 pc bucket of spicy jolly crispy chicken, a family size portion of jolly spaghetti, palabok and some peach mango pies. For 6 pieces, the chicken are actually decently sized, crispy and have a decent kick to them. The jolly spaghetti is Filipino style so it has a sweet sauce along with hot dogs and cheese so it is not for everyone if they are adverse to sweet pasta. The palabok was really good and they should really have a family size option. The peach mango pies taste great, they have a nice and crisp pie crust and the filling almost has a jackfruit taste to it. 

Overall, great to finally see them open up a location north of the border but my next visit will be at the Mississauga location when it opens up and even then I'll wait for the lineups to subside."}
{"text":"This rating is for 3.5 stars. I only had the Halo Halo here; there is a Red Ribbon bakery inside along with a few tables and chairs- a small space, though it was clean. But I liked it- it wasn't as big as Chow King's inside Seafood City (which is the BEST by the way), but I did enjoy having it since there aren't too many Filipino restaurant options in this area- the west side. (As I said before, I am very picky about Filipino food because so often, it is greasy and I don't like the orangey fatty liquid that is left on your plate, yuck and gross.) There is a bench outside but it is cold in the winter time. There is a drive-thru window as well."}
{"text":"I never go to jollibee and I have my reasons which I will explain below. We had a halo-halo craving and this was the closest place at the time to get it. Man was I totally disappointed! I should have just spent that $5 on a tub of ice cream. 

Upon walking in, holy jeez it was hot!! The ac was not on. All they had were multiple large fans circulating hot air! It was like walking into a giant oven. 

Next, my halo halo was pretty much just ice. It was topped with ube and mango ice cream and flan. I mixed it in with the rest and it was still bland. A halo halo is supposed to be chunky with a whole bunch of ingredients. But did I get that?! Nope!!! Just a little bit of red bean and 2 or 3 of the jelly things. The rest was all ice. Complete fail of a halo halo. 

As for the food, I don't eat it. Spaghetti is uber greasy. If you want Filipino spaghetti, just go to seafood city, buy the ingredients and make it yourself. Hell, I was born and raised in California and I make Filipino spaghetti better. Plus it's supposed to have hot dog pieces in the sauce. There's like 5. Another fail. The fried chicken, I don't know what it is, but it always has this weird taste. Like it's fried with old oil or something. It's like a rich taste, but not good. The chicken is served with a side of a gravy. For me, gravy doesnt really go well with spaghetti. However, I must say that the peach mango pies are delish. The crust is crisp and light while the filling is not too sweet. I once bought 6 of them so I could eat them later on. 

Only reason I gave them 2 stars was the staff. They are always so nice and quick with orders."}
{"text":"Pretty surprised at how much spaghetti noodles and sauce they give compared to other branches. They are very generous in serving."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is another establishment that is dropping off my list of go-to lunch places.  Behind the building there's a sign that says Jollibee Parking with parking spaces lined out.  After getting blocked in by a delivery truck, I patiently waited until a Jollibee worker fired off on me saying I wasn't supposed to park there.  I noticed she was pleasant to the older white woman who was blocked in too, (this Jollibee employee probably thought I was another lowly Filipino like herself that she could talk down to).  I fired off to her that I just patronized her restaurant and that she and property management should consider changing the sign as it's misleading.  The parking lines are further misleading.  This establishment and personnel can burn."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Philippines two weeks ago (where I ate SO much Jollibee) and was really excited to try out the Jollibee here! Unfortunately it isn't as juicy and flavourful as the one I had in Manila and Cebu. Still worth a try though, hopefully they perform tweaks to get close to the version I had (and dream about)!!"}
{"text":"If you read my about me I have an absolute love for fried chicken combined with rice and jollibee is probably the reason for this.  Combining the epitome of soul food with arguably the best condiment what more could you ask for?

Jollibee is located inside seafood city and is difficult to miss considering its what you see when you first walk in.  They used to have a variety of different specials on particular days but they have since gotten rid of those deals. They have a flat screen tv that plays all the popular filipino dramas and shows which are honestly quite interesting if not humorous to watch. 

I always go for the C3 which is made up of 2 pieces of chicken (thigh or leg but you can ask for two legs or two thighs) and two sides.  I always get two thighs, spicy with two sides of rice no drink which comes to about $5.95.  Their service is quick, so quick often times they hand me my order after i'm finish placing it lol.

Their filipino spaghetti is very good and honestly if they served better portions of it, i'd probably get it more often.  

Halo halo isn't too bad but I normally go to chow king thats across from the restaurant (ask to take out the jelly, it tastes better without it in my opinion)

Overall this place is an awesome spot by school that's affordable and satisfying!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Jollibee until now. I recently moved to Vegas and my girlfriend, the Pinay princess, insisted we stop. 

I.....don't.......get.......it.

I'm crazy about my girlfriend, not so crazy about my initial experiences with her culture's food, and I'm have a pretty dynamic and welcoming palate. This place just confused me. There was the \"Chickenjoy\" which pretty much looks like your run of the mill KFC (I'm not much for fast food on-the-bone fried chicken) but apparently it's serviceable. After that, the menu is all over the place. Hamburger steak, spaghetti with hot dogs, hamburgers, corned beef, spam, slushies with beans in them? This menu seems like something I would be inspired to put together at 3AM after 6 IPA's and a couple of bong hits, right before grocery day, in an attempt to clear out my fridge and cabinets. Don't get me wrong, to each their own, and these are all great food items in their own right, just a weird menu to me. 

The girlfriend was excited to go there, I think it's a nostalgia thing primarily. I think these foods for Filipinos are parallel to the comfort foods I've come to know from the Midwest and South areas of the US. Like a little taste of home. The place was pretty packed and it was attached to an Asian grocery store that looked like an interesting browse. I have to admit, I didn't eat, she did. My stomach was being fickle that day and nothing seemed appetizing to me. Three stars because it made the gf happy and the ambiance was intriguing, made me feel as if I were somewhere else besides the middle of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love their Spaghetti  it's very tasty . Great service . Good customer service and prompt service"}
{"text":"This is a decent fast food joint that recently opened in Scarborough.  Everyone has been raving about it for weeks, months, and lineups since then have decreased from several hours to now 15 minutes during non-peak times.  I had heard so many mixed reviews that I felt like I had to try this myself.  Thanks to another Yelp reviewer, I came at around 4:30pm on a Tuesday expecting it to not have such a huge lineup.

And I was right--15-20 minutes wait from entering the tent at Kennedy Commons to exiting the doors with my bags of food.

Keep in mind that this is a fast food restaurant, like McDonald's, KFC, etc...inside looks just like any other fast food place. Very busy but also quite organized with their system.  You enter the tent, they give you a number on a laminated card (which also has info about limited food orders), you enter the restaurant, and pay for your food at the cash area. Cash area has maybe 3 cashiers running and there are 2-3 other people on the right side putting the food onto trays and bags. Once you pay, you get a buzzer and it'll notify you when your food is ready!

As for the food, I ordered $45 worth of food so that I could try everything because who knows when I'd be back here again.  Ordered the Bucket Treat \"B\" combo with 3 pies, 6-pieces of chicken (spicy thighs and legs), large gravy, and large (very) sweet spaghetti.  I also ordered two pineapple juices and medium sized fries. 

Fries were like McD's--very similar in taste, size and shape! Spaghetti with hot dog pieces was super sweet--I didn't mind it so much at first but definitely can't eat very much of it at once.  Gravy has a sweetness to it as well, which is something I'd have to get used to. It's similar to KFC gravy but just sweeter. Spicy fried chicken was crispy, actually spicy (seems like hot pepper powder was sprinkled on top), and juicy on the inside. Not as salty or peppery as KFC and very similar in crispiness of Popeye's (and I love Popeye's btw). Pineapple juice was tasty and sweet--reminded me of the juice from canned pineapples. Peach and mango pie was good but not so different from other places like McDonald's--again, very sweet, but very crispy shell.

Staff were friendly and when they give you your food, they tell you \"Have a jolly day!\" How can you not after that?!? :D

All in all, good fast food restaurant, but definitely not worth waiting hours in line for, unless it has some sort of nostalgic factor for you. It has similar prices as other fast food chains.  Their menu is limited as well, but they are known mostly for their chicken.  It's definitely worth a try if you like KFC or Popeye's or if you're looking for something a bit different to try."}
{"text":"Clean dining area as you walk in.  Great greeting with a smile.

Ordered two meals, dine in.  Plus halo halo to go.  They held it till I was finish with my meal and asked if I am ready for the halo halo.  Again, courteous from another worker.

Back to the meals.  My dads first time at Jollibee.  He was impressed the chicken was cook to the bone.  No red.  White meat.  And crispy.  He loved the sweet corn and mash potatoes with gravy.  Delicious.

My meal was also spot on, hence reason I took my dad who was craving a fried chicken.  We live 30 minutes away.  Worth the drive all the time.  Hope they are putting a Jollibee at the new centennial seafood market!  Haven't seen any advertising.  We need one!

Next time we will have the spaghetti."}
{"text":"I was on vacation last week in Vegas and I was craving Jollibee chicken and spaghetti, so I ate here.  The chicken was good but what have you guys done to the spaghetti?? I don't know if it was an off day or not but the spaghetti did not taste like Jollibee spaghetti at all.  It tasted more americanized aka not sweet.  Did you guys change the recipe for the spaghetti in this location??  If you did, then change it back!!!"}
{"text":"For a grocery shopping lunch stop the food really hits the spot for me. It's dark meat chicken fried and served with hot gravy and noodles... Yum!"}
{"text":"Another Chicken & Burger joint that has popped up over by Boulevard Mall...so I decided to give it a go.

Located inside the Seafood Supermarket I had NO IDEA it was a filipino fast food franchise..It simply READ Chicken & Burgers...

I don't really have much to say on this one....I barely got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite I tried before spitting it out. Definitely an acquired taste because the place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the chicken meals not too many eating burgers:("}
{"text":"My girlfriend often comes to Seafood City and she told me we needed to stop by to get something.  Then we happen to come along Jollibee, it seems like a nice little establishment.  I didn't really know at the time that this was a big chain.

I have tried the purple Boba slush and it is farely decent.  I don't really get the appeal of the place, I'm guessing this is like a KFC of Filipino food?  The staff seems helpful and I'm sure I will try the food selection sooner or later.

As for now, I think this place is A-OK.  The prices seem reasonable, I'll be back to give it a more in-depth try.

{"text":"I LOVE JOLLIBEE, since there isn't any in Northern Nevada, we take a pit stop here every time before the long drive back home. Please bring it to Reno! Anyways, let's break it down:
 
Setting/Service:
This location is fairly small, but they have a decent amount of seating. It is right before the entrance to Seafood City (a Filipino supermarket) and other Filipino food chains.
The workers are all nice (and mostly, if not all Filipino). I think most of the time when we come here we're out in like 10 minutes, it's great!

Food:
CHICKENJOY, not chickenSAD. The fried chicken here is crispy and juicy, I always get it with a side of rice, and the gravy that comes with it is also delicious!
Other menu items that are really good are, the mango pie, spaghetti, and halo-halo!

Overall: A-
The epitome of Filipino fast food and it is does not disappoint, HIGHLY recommend trying if you've never had it before!!"}
{"text":"Love this place but got a yum burger today and took a bite to find this. Looks like a knob from a watch."}
{"text":"Probably one of the few fast food chains from the P.I. that I legitimately like. Jollibee is probably not the best representation of Filipino food but it's still a decent restaurant chain. I do like the fact that after visiting four different locations their food stays pretty consistent. At this Vegas location, it's inside a seafood supermarket area surounded by a bunch of other Asian stores. The area is well kept, only thing was the bathroom was out of order the day we went. When we ordered we got rice, criss cut fries, chicken, and palabok (a noodle dish). They are known mostly for their chicken which to me is consistently good, same thing with the palabok. Only thing is, for a fast food chain they are pretty expensive, I think I almost spent $30 for everything we got. It was a decent size though and filled three people up. Most of the dishes are not common together at fast food chains in the U.S. so I recommend going with a Filipino if you can, just to get acclimated and help you order."}
{"text":"Good chicken and the ability to make your meal healthier with corn and rice as side dishes. All for about $7 including drink so for fast food it's not bad. Much better than KFC with an easier menu to order from. They also have a bake shop attached at this location."}
{"text":"There is a Kentucky Fried Chicken in the same vicinity but I choose Jollibee almost every time. It's not because of their chicken but because they offer white rice as a side dish. Jollibee's chicken isn't as crunchy as KFC's but I prefer white rice with my meal. Jollibee's chicken comes with a side of brown dipping sauce. I usually pass on it because I prefer making my own sauce (rice vinegar, 3 cloves of crushed garlic, crushed red pepper, and if you like it salty a little bit of patis). I also like the fact that I can get Mountain Dew with my meal because most fast food places don't offer it. Their lumpia (egg rolls) is okay but I prefer Jack in the Box's egg rolls because they're tastier. I've tried their mini sandwiches that have the corned beef and the spam in them but after a while I get nauseous because their is too much mayo on them. When I'm not ordering through the drive thru I like to go inside and look at their pastries and breads because their is a Red Ribbon Bakery in there.I like the fact that I don't have to go all the way to Seafood City for Pandesal (rolls)."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! It's got all the bests of fast foods:

Popeyes fried chicken. 
KFC's chicken gravy ( and even more superior mashed potato)
McDonald's fries. 
The peach mango pie is McDonald's apple pie equivalent. 

As a bonus, the palabok was quite flavorful. 

On top of that their efficiency and crowd control is very impressive despite the long line. 
Came here on a Tuesday night (7:30pm ish), waited just less than 2 hours. But the order took less 10 mins to assemble, and was devoured in 20 mins!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch, without checking out the reviews on yelp..... Big Mistake.... Big ..... Huge!
Definitely listen to the reviews. This is for people who know Jollibee... grew up eating it in another country, and are looking to rekindle a memory....
Otherwise, STEER CLEAR of this place!!!
My husband ordered 3 pieces of fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich. They told me it would be 6 minutes for my sandwich... I said fine, it will be fresh.... not a problem at all.
They brought my husbands food out right away, he said the chicken was okay... the mashed potatoes were bad! Instant potatoes... ugh
They said my sandwich would be right out......
15 minutes later...... no sandwich... went to the counter and they said \"it will be right up\"
waited 5 more minutes and left.... won't wait another minute for food that I know isn't good, and don't want any kind of replacement...... won't be back.

DO NOT GO TO THE RESTROOM!!!!
NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"Gross. I know my fellow Filipinos would decry me as unfaithful to my country but this shit is straight-up garbage. If being Filipino means liking Jollibee, then I am in for some serious identity crisis.

I simply cannot back up this establishment. Like seriously, this is not Filipino food, well most of it isn't. A more accurate description would be a disastrous take on American and Italian food. Sweet burgers and hot dog littered spaghetti? Ugh. Soggy fries? Ugh. So-So fried chicken? If I was starving, maybe. Filipinos who grew up eating here adore the shit out of this fucking bee. Their only redeemable item was their fried mango pie and even that made me go in to a tailspin. Why? Because there was a pube on my pie. Oh lawd. This is not good. 

On a forealzies level, if you're unfamiliar with this place, keep it that way. You'll save your hard earned cash and avoid food poisoning. It's overpriced and so not worth buying that teriyaki burger or hot dog spaghetti. Instead, for burgers, hit up In-n-Out, it's cheap and delicious. For spaghetti? Go to Parma in Summerlin, kinda pricey but it's far more authentic and savory. But please, do not be lured by the creepy bee. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Variety in offerings is nice but the store was cluttery, staff was unfriendly, and they were out of a sweet an sour sauce.  I didn't understand how a foos joint could be attached to a grocery store and say that they are out of a condiment with a straight face."}
{"text":"Inside seafood city market.. 
Filipino fast food.. 

Great menu for a quick bite to eat.. their main dish is spaghetti, chicken(with yummy gravy on the side).. chicken has a lot of flavor and vey crispy which goes very well with their authentic gravy and make sure to eat it with rice;)

Great customer service.. we came here on a Wednesday for lunch.. they were very fast.. great fast food..."}
{"text":"We had a family reunion this past weekend in Las Vegas and all of us tried to experience all that was Vegas together.

Coming from the Midwest, we don't get to experience Jollibee or any chain restaurants from the Philippines... so of course who would not want to visit this establishment when in town! The food... always as I remembered.. Chicken is always crispy and the gravy adds just a perfect touch to the crunchy wonder and to complete your Jollibee experience would be their famous spaghetti! 

Now.... for the service. Since it was the sunday before Labor Day... Jollibee was rockin at lunchtime and so was the chaos. But for several of my family members we shared a family meal of a bucket of chicken with spaghetti and rice.  I believe the order came with 3 pies. We ordered 2 peach/mango pies and a banana/langka pie along with a bottle of water. 

We got our order, but no pies.. We ate and after the meal I brought the receipt back to the counter and told the employee from which we ordered our meal...she referred us to the manager (she was wearing a blue top with glasses, bun on her head).  I explained we received our order except for the pies.  Instead of simply apologizing and giving the  pies... she goes on to tell me she filled the order herself and remembers the bottle of water and that she put the pies on the tray. I told her, \"no... sorry... we did not receive any pies.\" She then states, \"well... where were you sitting.\" I told her where we were sitting. (Not that I needed to do that... she basically IMPLIED THAT I WAS LYING!) Seriously!!!!#$%^&*() Then she tells me.... \"I put the order together... I remember I put the water on the tray. After going back and forth for a few minutes... I told her do you think it is possible (in this crazy world we live in) that someone else ordered chicken and spaghetti at Jolibee's along with a BOTTLE OF WATER! 

C'mon! 

It's not until I asked her... \"are you seriously going to argue with me about pies?\" then she looked embarrassed... and just gave me the pies cause she didn't want her employees and other patrons staring.  Didn't look at me... didn't say sorry. Just tossed the pies. I almost said prior to her giving the pies... forget it... just give me my money back. I would expect this from an hourly employee, but not a manager whom which \"should\" be setting an example. If this is what the managers do... I can only speculate what the rest of the staff does. 

I hardly go on to yelp... but I like to read many reviews. So this is a pretty bad experience in order for me to yelp. 

To the manager at this location... Thank you for ruining my nostalgic experience for the Philippines"}
{"text":"Growing up in the Philippines, Jollibee is a childhood favorite. I live in AZ, so there are no locations near by. Which is why whenever I go to Vegas, I make it a point to visit Jollibee. This time around, I had jolly spaghetti, big yum burger, and peach mango pie! Everything was as delicious as I remember. All of the staff were very kind, courteous, and welcoming."}
{"text":"Mango-peach pie totally caught me off guard!!!

My friend purchased it in the morning and gave it to me several hours later. I kept it in the plastic bag and ate it maybe 10 hours afterwards. I wasn't expecting much as I don't really like peach (I like mango) and it wasn't  hot out of the oven. What I like most about pie is when the crust is crispy from being fresh out of the oven. Despite not being warm, this pie was delightful crispy!!! The pie was also generously filled. I think the difference between this and a McDonald's pie is that this must be deep fried while McDonald's is baked, making it soft once cooled.

This pie was amazing and something I would highly recommend. It is too bad that the lines at jolibee are so long.

(I tried 1 spicy chicken thigh with gravy, but it was soggy after 3-4 hours being in the bucket so no taste review until I try it fresh)"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that my family and I waited 7 hours for Jollibee (mind you, others waited even more than that) I was glad to taste a little piece of home for Easter. Besides the Mississauga location (which hasn't opened yet), I think they made a smart move with opening a restaurant here in Scarborough. It's right in Kennedy Commons which is literally right beside the highway and if you're commuting there, it's literally a 5 minute walk once you get off the bus. There's a lot of free parking space so you can bring your 20 cousins. The restaurant itself is bright, pretty spacious, lots of seating areas and clean. Since it was opening day, the service was impeccable - from the moment you walk into the restaurant, the order taking, when you receive your food and even when you leave. Because of the crazy amount of people, beepers were given to customers but I'm pretty sure they're going to stick with this method as I don't see the popularity of this place dying out anytime soon. We got Bucket Treat B ($33.99) which comes with a crispy chicken bucket (6 pieces), spaghetti family pack and 3 peach mango pies (we also got 2 yum burgers and 2 pineapple quenchers - which came up to $51). 

The pineapple quenchers were very refreshing (good after waiting 7 hours in line) and not overwhelmingly sweet. The yum burgers were so nostalgic since they tasted just like HOME. The chicken was extra crispy and the size of the pieces weren't small either. The portion of spaghetti they offer as a family pack is to be honest, pretty disappointing since they serve it in a really large container. And if you're not into sweet pasta, I'd keep away from the spaghetti because filipino spaghetti tends to be on the sweeter/saucier side. But the item that really made it worth waiting in line for was the peach mango pie - the crust was super crispy and dough-ey, you can taste a good mix of peach and mango AND it wasn't crazy sweet. If you go there, I highly suggest trying it out. 

For those who have had Jollibee back home, you already know. I definitely want to visit again when the hype dies down (cause who really wants to wait hours and hours for fast food). But I can truly say that the employees of Jollibee did a great job in accommodating their customers for their first day (2 tents with heating) and already look forward to bringing my 20 cousins, nieces and nephews and aunts and uncles!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaalright. I may have a little bias towards this place because (uhem..I'm Filipino) And although it may not be the first fast food restaurant I run to or even really have at the top of my list for anything, I still have cravings like once or twice a year for it. There's just something about their chicken that I LOVE. Pair that with their Palabok & Ube Boba and I'm done! Thirst quenched. Cravings satiated. Thank you. Goodbye. For real though.. this place seems to ALWAYS be busy so I can't really suggest any 'down' times for the best Chicken Joy experience, but go anyway. The loudness of the crowds and the crazy children running around adds to the fun, HA!"}
{"text":"Triple F -- Filipino Fast Food -  but try the burgers and the hotdogs last.  The palabok is good, the spaghettis is passable.  The breakfast items are the best.  Service is always spotty.  Just remember this is a FAST FOOD place!"}
{"text":"The Jollibee stung me in the gut, and I'm still recovering! There's nothing mind-blowing about the food, it's just a fast food place that serves American food that's been tweaked to suit more Asian tastes. In addition to burgers, fries, and Asian style drinks like bubble tea, they offer crispy fried chicken (AKA Chicken joy! I do give them props for the amusing name) and spaghetti. 

I tried the aloha burger combo and the halo-halo dessert. The burger tasted kind of like a McDonald's burger, except they stuck a pineapple inside of it. The fries were decent, and there's a self-serve soda fountain. Unfortunately one of the diet Pepsi machines was broken and it spurted out carbonated water on your hand in addition to the actual soda in the cup.

The halo-halo was OK, but whatever fruit was in it was very thready so when I first spooned out some of it, it looked like they had accidentally dropped some synthetic Barbie hair in it or something. The rest of the dessert was filled with shaved ice, 2 scoops of brightly colored ice cream, various sweet beans, jello chunks, and red bean paste. 

There's enough seating to accommodate people during busy times, and they play Filipino TV while you're eating your meal.

My verdict? Meh, it's alright, but don't come in expecting a lot, because it's just fast food!"}
{"text":"Okay gonna get a bashing from all the crazy Jollibee fanatics that lined up hours and hours in freezing cold weather at the beginning of the year for some Jollibee's chicken.  But I don't get the hype?  Sure its some good chicken but is it worth losing sleep and freezing your ass off for?  No thanks, rather sleep in my warm comfy bed thank you very much!

My wife was in the area and she decided to line up for some take out tonight.  The line was about an hour long around 5pm on a Sunday so not too bad.

The chicken was crispy and tender but to be honest not that flavorful.  I was told that you are suppose to dip the chicken in the gravy but even the gravy was just okay.  The spicy version wasn't spicy at all.  Tbh my family and I all agreed that we prefer the taste of Popeye's chicken.

The Jolly spaghetti as most people said was an acquired taste but we actually didn't mind the sweetness to it.  The standout though as most people have said was the peach mango pie.  Deep fried pockets of peach and mango filling really hits the spot!

Overall Jollibee's was not bad but if I had to choose I would much rather head to a Popeye's for our fast food fried chicken fix.  

3/5

Now I better run for cover before a Jollibee fanatic trys to beat me up!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best tasting fried chicken I've had anywhere! Ordered the two piece meal with rice, container of gravy and a drink. Good service and clean restaurant. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've never claimed to be very Pinoy. I haven't been to the Philippines since I was about 8 years old and until a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, I had never been to a Jollibee before. Well that visit inspired me to finally check out one of the Vegas locations.

My mentality as I approached the drive-thru window was simple. I might as well order everything I want to try now. Just get it out of the way so I don't have to come back. I ended up spending $14!

The verdict? The fried chicken was just so so. The side of mashed potatoes tasted like instant. The side of corn fared better, but basically that fried chicken combo was a bust.

Fortunately, the Filipino style spaghetti rocked! Honestly, I used to hate the sweetness of Filo spaghetti sauce. I'm probably still partial to a good, tart Italian Bolognese, but I'm totally down with Filo spaghetti these days and it is something that Jollibee does right.

On to dessert. You can get two pies for $3, so I opted to get both the Mango Peach and the Banana Langka (jackfruit). The Mango Peach was pretty good in its own right, but OMG! The Banana Langka is a superstar. I would totally come back just for that. It's basically like Turon. And that equals yumminess.

Overall, I can't give Jollibee more than two stars. It just misses the mark on basic food flavor (I'm referring to the fried chicken deal and the one bite of my cousin's cheeseburger I tried in SF). Still, it is totally worth a visit just for that Banana Langka Pie!"}
{"text":"Drop in this morning to try this craze. Not much of a line up. There was a crew that lists and take your orders while on the line. We ordered PALaBOK, CHiCKeN JoY, PeACH MaNGO PiE, eTc., and was given an order ticket.
When in the counter, we decided to add more items for take out, such as: BuRGeRS, sPagHeTTi, eTc., GueSS WHaT?
The crew told us that we already exceeded the order of $60.00 and will not be able to add anymore. We insisted we want to order more for take out. The crew made a request to the manager, but was rejected outright. The crew came back telling us that, because they have to stick with their policy of serving the people within the SCoPE oF 4 MiNuTeS SeRViNG TiME OnLY, we have to go back to basic and line up again.

So I further escalated my views and look for another store manager in which no one was confident enough to speak. Instead, they point fingers claiming that they are busy assisting other customers. I understand the store is full and they were busy, or aRE THeY?
Finally, one store manager bravely came and advised me about their strategies and policy. She told me that if I want to order more, I should line up again and get another order ticket, as they only allow 1 ticket per family. Another way is to separate our order and split our family from being together so we can get an individual order ticket. I told the manager that we were not even informed of such policy and tricks, where our orders will only be limited to certain amount. iSN'T iT LaCK oF CoMMUNiCaTioN BeTWeEN eMPLoYeeS WHiCH CaN ReSuLT To CuSToMeR FRuSTRaTioNS & DiSSaTiSFaCTiON NoT WaNTiNG To CoME BaCK aGaiN?

The store should strike while the iron is hot. In this kind of business, the store should sell as much as they can in less amount of time and make more profit, which I believe is contrary to the managers point of view.
As we continue exchanging our views, I told the manager that even if we split ourselves to get an individual ticket just to increase our order, we will still use the same debit card anyway, the manager refuses and told us that they can only accept single transaction of each debit card per person.

{"text":"This place gets a 3 stars for its nostalgic value of the Philippines. Other than that, I wouldn't say the atmosphere or menu boasts anything special. They have their signature chicken joy, Filipino style spaghetti (it's comparatively sweeter than the italian um...prototype?), all day breakfast combos with a choice of corned beef, beef tapa, sausages, egg, and rice. It's really just another fast food chain - themed up Filipino style. 

On to the more positive aspects though, you wouldn't want to miss the halo-halo. It's a famous island delicacy dessert composed of shaved ice mixed with evaporated milk and topped with all these goodies like ice-cream, leche flan, beans, fruits, jello. Not bad, I say, although I've tried waaaay better halo-halo back in the Philippines. 

To be honest, with Jolibee, what you see is what you get for the most part - except their little pan de sal bites. Don't be fooled by the ad sizes, they aren't that big and for 99cents an order, you would rather get a pack of bread at the next door Filipino bakery instead. Also, if it helps, they've also got a television placed above the drink machines playing Filipino Dramas and game shows. So if you are into the TFC channel, this is a good place to stop by and enjoy your meal to."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 69/100

FYI, Jollibee is like the McDonald's of the Philippines: notice the flamboyant mascot, pretty 'eh' of a menu, and its prolificness. They both have kiddie toys and accommodate birthday parties for teeny tots! 

Tonight, I got to attend a birthday event for one of my good friend's daughter who just turned 2 years old. We were provided with a private room with enough space for the guests (make that roughly 30) and an open space for the kids to play around and dance. People were given an hour to munch and socialize, which was then followed by an hour-long program that consisted of games for the kids (and one for the adults!) and finally, a dance number by the bumble bee mascot. He sure 'stung' that one Psy song like a boss! We all had fun and I could've sworn tonight's experience felt like I was teleported back to the Philippines for a while. (or maybe even Hong Kong - Yes, they have Jollibees there too!) The cashier up front even greeted me with the Filipino honorific 'po' when I ordered some food to-go! Awesometastic. 

Nonetheless, as much as I loved the company of tonight's crowd, Jollibee won't go up to my top 10 (or even 20) of fast food joints any time soon. The chicken joy is basically another word for 'Popeye chicken', with jollibee gravy added in. Oh, and there was so much fat attached to the chicken's skin, I wouldn't be surprised if you confused its consistency with jello. On a brighter note, I probably like the spaghetti best, sweet red sauce with hot dogs, very Filipino - lovveeee! Halo halo (shaved ice with beans, fruits, jelly and ice cream etc.) isn't bad either. Choose that for dessert or the peach mango pie. It's probably their alternative for the apple pie at Mickey D's for all I know!"}
{"text":"This place.......pros and cons. 

Pros: During the day it's not too bad minus that you get talked to in multiple languages despite you clearly are not of Asian/Filipino bloodline. They have super fast service and 8 of 10 times it's fresh. 

Con: Do not bother with the night staff and the service in drive thru. 9 of 10 times no matter what you order and even if you are the only car there you will have long wait just to order and then a long wait to get the food. Usually the process at night drive thru service is about 15mins even if you are the only car there. That's from pulling up the the speaker box to the moment you get your order. However, there has been more than one occasion where it took double that time. One time they greeted me and ask for me to wait a moment before I placed my order. They didn't come back on the speaker for 11mins. There was only on car ahead of me in the driver through and have been at the window when I arrived. Overall, that night was about 35mins for the process and the food was not even fresh. 

Conclusion, go during the day and learn some Tagalog.  Do yourself a favo9r and avoid the night staff and drive thru service."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, subpar food, even beverage not drinkable, guess Filipino will appreciate this hometown join..."}
{"text":"Who can say no to Jollibee? 

Compared to other fried chicken chains out there, Jollibee is on the expensive side, however the flavor or their chicken is almost addicting. Slather gravy on everything and enjoy.

The service at this one is quite friendly, and is in a very convenient location as you can do some Asian grocery shopping after (See Seafood City Review)

One bad thing is that they close at midnight."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every Sunday because my parents never want to eat anywhere else. The chicken has gotten smaller since they opened. The food isn't bad but it just doesn't compare to the Jollibee back home. 

The service is okay. It's a fast food restaurant so it's not like the workers really cater to you anyway."}
{"text":"I rarely write a review on Yelp but I'm so compelled to release my frustration with this particular chain's drive-thu service. Food is good but oh my gosh... Today was a record wait (FYI there's always a wait with this location)! 3 songs later I finally got my 2 piece burger steak... No drink, no side order. Here's my issue, another car was in front of me that obviously had a gazillion of food ordered but the cashier could have at least requested that family to park their car on the side if it meant a 12 minute wait for the next car - which was me!!! I really wanted to ditch my order but I was badly craving for some burger steak... Finally I pulled up. I told the cashier \"that was a record wait\" and the cashier had no reaction... Fine, I was waiting for an apology because I would have apologized if I made someone wait that long. The cashier then handed me my order and still nothing so I said to her \"I'm sorry that I waited\". She then gave me a confused look. Wow. Hey jollibee owner, at least the jollibees' in the Philippines provide faster service compared to here."}
{"text":"My family loves to eat at this place once in a while. I specially like their cakes. If you want to get someone a nice healthy B-day cake, buy a 
birthday cake at \"Jollibee\"."}
{"text":"My favorite food since I was kid! My go to fast food. Chicken joy with spaghetti and extra rice is what I always get. And the pineapple juice just complete my day."}
{"text":"I never waited in line here so I can't comment on that. I have had Jollibee's twice and both times someone else lined up for take out.

First, let's talk about the fried chicken. There are so many fried chicken restaurants I can compare it to these days since Toronto has been booming with them! I have only tried the Jollibee's located in Scarborough, and both times the quality was the same to me, no big difference. The problem with Popeyes is that the chicken is VERY store dependent. Some stores make them juicy and tender, others taste like hay. Jollibee's is almost as good as the best Popeyes I have had in terms of the texture of the meat. The skin is less oily than most fried chicken places like KFC. They are also not as salty as any of the other fried chicken fast food places. The chickens come in two flavours, mild and spicy. I can take spicy very well. The spicy at popeyes taste like mild to me, but the Jollibee's spicy is actually distinct. Although not as spicy as I would like it to be, but at least you will taste it.

The mango peach pie filling is heavenly. The crust is a bit too thick, felt like I was eating the dough half the time. Recommend the pineapple drink. Mashed potatoes where meh."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Filipino spaghetti but love jollibee fried chicken. 

Yes, it's a little pricey but I love that you get a side of gravy to dip your chicken in! The mashed potatoes are good, corn is good, but the best part is the mango peach pies that they fry fresh! So worth the 6-8 minute wait. 

Only real downfall is that they no longer do corned beef sliders :( 

Anyways, yes, it's a little more expensive in comparison to Popeyes, KFC, or Church's. The buckets come in 6 - request dark meat only (so much better but no, it does not get any cheaper like it would at any other fast food chicken joint. 

It's always busy when I come here and the people are always nice and you get your food quickly. I have yet to have a bad experience here and will keep coming back for that fried chicken"}
{"text":"Only place I know where to get fried pies (like the old MCds apple pies).

Idk why I keep coming here because their prices are ridiculously high compared to other fast food places.  IT's a wannabe KFC mixed with PI food."}
{"text":"I typically do not come here for the food, I always come for the boba polar freeze. I love the Ube, but the boba is really bland. I also am not a fan of the long wait...it is always a 5-10 minute wait just for them to go from order to order....just to turn around and pour some Ube freeze into a cup and give it to me."}
{"text":"Hehehehe two toes up from me simply for the Boba tea. I could drink bucketfuls of that stuff and totally regret it the next day. Let me tell you a story. My younger cousin was taking Tagalog classes and was a member of the Filipino club at his local high school. I was staying with them for a month, and he was going off with all his newfound Tag-logs. I was getting reasonably irked, so I suggested we go for Jollibee. \"Kuya, what do you call the Burger with Egg?\" \"Oh, that would be the JOLLY BETLOG, Ray. Go in there and order us 5 of them, get the combos. Here's $20.\" So off he goes to order the JOLLY BETLOG. *hilarity ensues* Needless to say, all the wannabe-fobness around the house ceased immediately."}
{"text":"I love love love their spaghetti. I can eat a whole tray by myself. They are always giving the right amount of sauce which is a big thing for me since i wont eat spaghetti if the pasta is more than the sauce. -_- plus they have hotdog bits in it!   and right amount of melted cheese. I just love it. 

Their beef steak is pretty good too. They serve it with rice and gravy. You can order it with egg too if you want. 

Their chicken is just amazing! Never dry and add the gravy... omg. Delicious! You can get this with rice or spaghetti. 

It's never packed to the point that i cant find a seat. It's always clean and they serve it pretty fast. They even added a buzzer to let you know that your food is ready.

The price is not expensive but since a lot of their food and desserts here make you want to get them all, it kinda adds up in the end."}
{"text":"I'm confused. Nothing was edible. Fries were chewy and starchy. The fried chicken was old and smelly. The so called yummy burger was the most disgusting of it all I don't even know what kind of meat it was it didn't taste like anything I've ever eaten. I'm so confused how this place is in business"}
{"text":"So i always eat here but then again i ordered chicken strips and the cashier told me it will take 10 minutes so i waited for more than 10 minutes then i went to my car and eat my food but the chicken is stale and cold.I thought they are going to give me a new one but they did not."}
{"text":"It's a bit crowded at times but what are you gonna say? It's a Filipino restaurant. Spaghetti is so good staff is very friendly. Enjoyed it"}
{"text":"This is the worst jolibee here in the US. Customer service is zero. They don't care about customer satisfaction. Even the manager need a class in customer service."}
{"text":"It is located on a nice location off the south west corner of the shopping plaza. Plenty of seating available for friends and family. 

Menu on the television was pretty cool. It even showed a few pictures of what the food looked like and the pricing. There is quite a bit of items so the screen changes every few seconds.

I only came for the dessert so I ordered the halo-halo which is a popular Filipino dessert with mixtures of shaved ice and evaporated milk to which are added various ingredients, including boiled sweet beans, coconut, sago, gulaman (agar jelly), tubers and fruits. 

I also ordered the ube pearl coolers and the peach mango pie.

I enjoyed all the desserts and they all hit the spot. Customer service was satisfying and the tables were clean."}
{"text":"This Jollibee location is one of the cleanest I've been to. I've walked into some locations that the floors are sticky, tables are not wiped down. The staff here are friendlier too. 

This fast-food place specializes in Filipino food, with very limited selection. They are popular for their fried chicken. Food is pretty much consistent with small portions. But enough for a meal for one person. Don't forget to get their halo halo (mixed fruit with shaved ice) dessert, which is popular in the Philippines specially in the summer time to cool you down."}
{"text":"Jollibee is a staple in the Philippines. Ok seriously it's kinda like Fast Food Filipino/American Fusion. It makes me laugh because it's like McDonalds with a twist. The only thing vegetarian here is french fries. I was surprised and excited when I heard this was coming into town. I remember when it first came into town in LA. So this place is nestled in the Best Buy Shopping Center at Seafood City. It's next to Jason's Deli. 
There's a weird feeling when I came up to it this weekend. One....It was hotter than shit out. Two....I have never seen so many filipinos. It's like one of the islands crash landed nearby. Seriously they were like ants coming out of the ground. 
Jollibee is known for just a few menu items:
Yumburger, Double Yum, Champ Burger and the Amazing Aloha with grilled pineapple - The Burger itself is pretty thick - not your average burger. 1/3 meat. Cooked all the way through - kinda tastes hearty with beef broth or onion soup mixed into it. 
Noodles: Pacit Palabok - it's a noodle dish with thick rice noodles and sorta a thick sauce with ground pork rinds...scallions, hardboiled egg....Yea...I know Healthy right? Jollibee also carries spaghetti. But it's filipino spaghetti with sliced hot dogs and meat. It's slightly sweeter than american or italian. It's also topped off with cheese. Mmmm yea way healthy.
Finally there's Chicken Joy. YAY Joy. Fried chicken. Served with a side of gravy and rice. 
Couldn't decide so I ordered a noodle, burger, and chicken. I don't get that that often...so what? I do what I want. The lines are a lil slow, the food isn't really bad. It's not great, but you know it's a novelty. I took it back to work. Had a few bites of each and it was over. I'd definitely go back. I mean I gotta try the boba! 
If you want a taste of the Phillipines and filipina girls are out of the question - this is a good place for baby steps."}
{"text":"Something different to try, fried chicken was quite good, crispy and juicy. Spaghetti was overly sweet, but some people might like it. 

Here is my main problem with this place:

Me at the drive-through: Do you have the sweet pork?
Jollibee employee: Yes, but there'll be a 15 minutes wait, sir.
Me: Oh, never mind. Can I have one order of the chicken dippers with rice?
Jollibee: 15 minutes wait, sir.
Me: How about Chicken Joy with rice then?
Employee: Sure, will take ten minutes.

I waited at the drive-through window for about ten minutes to get the most common item on the menu. Come on. A full-service restaurant can do better than this."}
{"text":"I heard all my Filipino friends talk about Jollibee but never got around to trying it. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just more of an acquired taste type of thing... I might have also made the mistake of thinking that spam and spaghetti was a good idea. It tasted funny. That's all I'm saying. Kind of bland, the noodles weren't properly coked through so that didn't help either. I'm not sure why theres so much spam, I thought that was Hawaiian? Weird, anyways I took one bite and the rest into the trash. 

The chicken which everyone reaves about was pretty meh. It was warm and crispy, but the coating was so thick and dough-ey. I'd much rather get KFC, which I've steered clear of for years. Service is really bad, I was asking questions and the girl at the cashier didn't really know the menu, hence I got all the weird and bad stuff.  Why Jollibee, Why. I'd maybe go back but it'd have to be with some Filipinos so they can educate me on the Jollibee culture."}
{"text":"Honestly....I don't think I've had a bad experience ordering from this location yet lol its fast food and I expect grease no matter what fast food restaurant I go to. I really enjoy the chicken, gravy and spaghetti occasionally! The halo halo is great for those hot summer days and their peach mango pies are by far a lot more flavorful than a McDonald's pie. Just saying."}
{"text":"Like many other Jollibees across the nation, this location is located inside Seafood City Supermarket in Las Vegas.  When you enter, it will be located on your right hand side of the entrance.  Chowking will bee located on your left hand side.  For a Seafood City Jollibee, this one is pretty spacious.  There is a decent amount of table and seating areas.  I came here for the first time during the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight.  The Filipino pride is high whenever it comes down to a Pacquio fight in Vegas.  In regards to everything else, I am pretty much Jollibee biased.  The staff and customer service is good.  The prices for everything is pretty decent.  You can actually get a satisfying meal for a good price, for example, a crunchy chicken sandwich, side of fries, and a drink can get you for about 5 bucks or so.  The kids meals are also pretty good deals too.  I would suggest the yumburger one though.  My favorites are the breakfastjoys specifically the tocino one.  If you haven't tried Jollibee before, they are known for the chickenjoy, jolly spaghetti, and yumburgers.  I would say the chickenjoy is the most popular food item though.  The best dessert is probably either the peach mango pie or halo halo.  When in doubt, Jollibee."}
{"text":"To start off, the food is great! The Crispy Chicken(Chickenjoy) is to die for and juicylicious! The pinoy spaghetti, burger steak, palabok and my favorite Peach Mango Pie are really the best.  To be honest, It's not just the food...it's the experience, the memories and the pride that a Filipino fast food restaurant has made it this far, is what Jollibee brings! More than the long line-up and wait time, kudos to Jollibee for providing heated tents in an effort to make patrons comfortable. Not all store openings and product launches can be this considerate and proactive! Wishing Jollibee continued success! I can't wait for the opening of the Mississauga location!"}
{"text":"Is the food good?  Unless you're Filipino, the answer is a resounding no!  For some reason, this place is like catnip for my Fiancee and her Filipino family.  The clear standouts that make this place worth the trip are:
1. Cheesiness.  No more cheesy than your average fast food place, but this is Pinoy cheese!
2. Chicken Joy.  This is some damn fine fried chicken.  I'll give them that.
3.  It will make your Filipino in-laws happy!
4.  It is a quick and easy way to get some halfway authentic Filipino food somewhat easily.  

Give it a shot, I would even suggest driving across town for it, but you probably won't need to go twice.

ps.  I plan on copying and pasting this review into every Jollibee I've ever had the pleasure of being forced in to, just so you can see what I am subjected to on every vacation.  *sigh* the things we do for love."}
{"text":"If you are craving for some Filipino  spaghetti well here it is! Jollibee! 

I like this location better too!
You gotta have red ribbon beside it ;)

We got the bucket A or B? Lol it comes with chicken, spaghetti and peach mango pie! 
No rice so you gotta order them rice! 

Pineapple juice - is a must! Nothing compares pineapple juice from the Philippines.

Service is okay I guess. Cashier was snobby and she probably hates her job for some reason. Food is good though so eeehhhh

I do suggest to eat here than the one on Maryland pkwy"}
{"text":"Ang Crispylicious at Juicylicious! Chicken joy is a joy to enjoy. Ang sarap to.

Jollibee is a Filipino fast food chain. They specialize in chicken, spaghetti and burgers. The burgers are pretty horrible, but the chicken and spaghetti are very satisfying. Skip all the other menu items and order the Chickenjoy with Jolly Spaghetti. The salty and crisp chicken perfectly compliments the sweet and soft spaghetti."}
{"text":"Came 30 minutes before closing time on a Friday and expected there to be no line up, but of course there was. It looked like it would take a long time because we had to wait in the parking lot, but the total wait time was only 10 minutes. We ordered a chicken bucket, a peach juice and a mango pie.

Everything came out pretty quickly. The spicy chicken is really spicy, so be careful!! The chicken comes with gravy, which is really good to dip in. The peach juice was super sweet and the mango pie was a little gross. It tasted like can peaches stuffed in a crust."}
{"text":"yes Jollibee is open here, but unfortunately it is hard to tell because the place is new.  I found this by accident when driving by and said yes we have to go. The chicken joy was great as well with the corn and mashed potatos for very cheap.  You can get a reward card as well for a shirt or doll, but I do not live in Las Vegas.  I really enjoyed the food like always."}
{"text":"We went to go pick up cake from red ribbon. I saw Jollibee and immediately wanted to get some. I ordered the 2 piece chicken (spicy) with the side of rice and their spaghetti togo! Their spicy chicken is literally my fave! I love that they give gravy on the side for dipping the chicken and pouring over their rice. The spaghetti is also SO GOOD. Eating this definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna skip to the real reason why there's still a 45 minute wait to chicken at this joint. There seems to be enough info on menu, price and first take (or the 100th) on chicken a la 3 stars and the sun.
Here's mine.

A childhood anecdote of countless tv commercials showcasing Filipino celebrities digging into some crispy fried chicken making this famous Filipino fast food franchise a staple to every weekend's cravings. 

Touchdown and on route to a quick take out at J's while we take in the polluted air of Manila with the constant honking of the jeepneys and tricycles, home for a month and each item on the menu is in pesos. Currency conversion makes it so much more of a deal when you're bringing in the dollar.

In the Philippines, McDonald's was never a threat to 'the bee' for the target audience's taste buds never differed from home cooking. Fried chicken and rice is the ultimate meal for a child back home, even more so a treat for the less fortunate ones in families struggling to eat 3 meals a day. 

For some, this would be the best hot meal you could give a 4 yr old street beggar in the streets of Manila. At least that was what my experience was when I visited my homeland when I was 9 and realized how much of a brat I was for not being able to appreciate what my parents have mapped out towards my future for better education, healthcare and opportunity in general.

Most franchises opened up in Manila, one of the first of many my mama could remember was 1979 when my siblings were 5 and 3. They were amongst  many visiting from nearby Philippine provinces making an important pit stop to a chicken joy meal as they journey to embassies to get their passports approved to voyage to the next chapter in their lives, foreign countries.

So when Jollibee announced opening day this year, we were finally getting a piece of home in my foreign home, a landmark of that bloody bright red bee that used to scare the hell outta me when I was a kid! It took long enough for it to arrive in the great north! I saw countless Filipino Canadians roadtripping to the U.S just to get a picture taken with the mascot along with their spaghetti selfies and pineapple upgrades to hashtagging #Iloveyousabado to the extremes. 

So yes the food maybe pricey, the chicken may or may not be better than Popeyes, the spaghetti might trigger diabetes for the sweetness factor and the pineapple juice might just be straight from a Dole can stirred with ice, and why so much rice? ...but never question the loyalty of a Filipino to this chain because with the record breaking line ups still happening under that white tent, we might just be fanning harder than any female teen in any given concert, PERIOD!! 

We tried everything when we came here, my hubby went nuts on the buckets like it was the ice bucket challenge and the maximum $60 per person was highly unacceptable to him that he even wanted our 8 month old son to be given rights to a yellow card, just so we could order more mango pies. I got me a keeper of hubba, and because gout runs cold in his veins, chicken is his go to protein so this was a major cheat days of cheat years!!!!!

Thanks JOLLIBEE!!! It was an awesome FIRST EXPERIENCE!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait is over. I've been craving for Jollibee Chicken Joy for almost 4years and finally I get to try it again. The opening day of Jollibee was crazy, Came to line up at 4am and get to order at 10-11sh am. Jollibee fried chicken made me feel home(Philippines). If you don't have a patience waiting in line I recommend to try it after the hype is done. Lol"}
{"text":"Service is always slow. Wait for chicken is long. Today's visit we where told as always a ten minute wait for chicken dippers. After ten minutes our order was sitting on the counter getting cold. When I walked up to check on the status, the person who appears to be the manger informed me the order is not complete. Waiting on gravy and it will be another ten minutes. Our food is was going to be cold if our food was left to sit on the counter. The employees where more concerned about addressing a defective entry door than taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"This drive tru sucks made me go to the curb coz my food ain't ready .. and took awhile .. is suppose to be fast! Smh"}
{"text":"I don't know a single person who doesn't like Jollibee, like I've converted all my friends. The fried chicken is out of this world with that amazing batter, alongside with some steamed rice. Like Wingstop and Popeyes need to start serving white steamed rice with their chicken because it's awesome! And don't get me started on the palabok. Don't get me wrong, I love homemade, but this palabok hits the spot every single time. I really like this location in Seafood City because it's convenient, but I've had the same great food and service at the other location."}
{"text":"There are Jolibees in SoCal but I've never been there so I can't compare to this Vegas location. I came here on a Vegas trip with my Filipino boyfriend's family. Apparently they like it. This was my first time and according to the ratings, I did not have high expectations. 

Service:
Considering the large order, I'll say it wasn't that bad. Good job on keeping up with it. However, they did forget the toddler's large fries. 

Food:
I had the chicken joy combo with mashed potatoes. The chicken was alright. I prefer Popeyes if I'm going with fast food chicken. The mashed potatoes were terrible. They were cold and tasted like the ones you get in the frozen dinner boxes (sorry). Considering I was very hungry, I did not have a pleasant experience. I tried my bf's ultimate burger and it was okay. It was just ground meat drenched in gravy. Is there msg? Probably. We got one order in and one take out. I poked the egg in the take out order and it felt fake and rubbery. So weird! The yolk would not break. I ate his fries. 

The empanadas were okay even though it makes your mouth a bit dry. Needs ketchup. 

The peach mango pie was probably the only thing I liked. 

Drinks:
Pineapple juice - I like it. 
Buko pandan boba - it was alright. 
Halo halo - I didn't try it much. It was okay. Bf liked it."}
{"text":"Mmmm...Jollibee!  I love the fried chicken, it's lighter and tastier than say KFC or Popeyes (Popeyes=ewwww anyways) or anything Americans are used to as far as fried chicken goes.  Their Spicy?  Is SPICY.  One piece of their spicy fried chicken and I'm done!  But oh so good.  If you like spaghetti, don't eat their spaghetti thinking it's just spaghetti.  It's a sweeter sauce with hot dogs in it.  Yesss, hot dogs.  Don't dog it (hehe) til you try it!  Lumpia is delicious and crispy.  I wish there was a Jollibee closer to Henderson (not the Maryland location...I mean HENDERSON.), because they'd get my business like no other."}
{"text":"Sometimes I need to get my (Filipino) Chicken on. I love fried chicken and grew up going to Jollibee as a kid.

I am not much for their burgers and I dunno if I like the Flip \"interpretation\" of burgers....but I must say it is tons better in Philippines than it's done here. I skip it. 

It's about chicken. Period. I do think this is a good fast food chicken and rather go here than KFC anyday. Plus, I'm a ricer and I like my chicken with rice...unless it's a chicken and waffle joint then I heart that too. 

Spaghetti- keep in mind, again filipino style so it has ground beef, hotdogs, with a sweet sauce with cheese. I like this on occasion.

Palabok is okay here, but rather skimpy on toppings. The BF rather get it at Chow King if we're strictly picking from chains in the same center. 

Don't forget the sweet stuff. I loove Ube and Pandan shake and the mango pie is the bomb. Ef the pies at other fast foods.

 It's kinda a rarity for me to eat, I unlike my peoples are not magnetized to my peoples foods. Still, I come when I'm in the area and I am up always to eat some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"I love this place! There are a few items on the menu that aren't very good, however, that's why my rating is average. And I'm Filipina. 

I would order the cheaper 6-piece bucket, it's more worth your money! Split it between your family or something. I love the chicken, the sweet potato fries, and the banana langka dessert pie--much better than the peach mango, in my opinion. Jollibee is pretty satisfying for Filipino fast food, I'm likely coming back, I'm way too Filipina not to."}
{"text":"I am rating this location a ONE star because of consistently not having multiple menu items. 
A major chain restaurant should always have menu items in stock. Over the last several years, they have been out of the sandwhiches 80% of the time. 
When I order chicken they will sometimes get \"spicy\" and \"not spicy\" confused. 
I am not very picky but at least have menu items most of the time. 
The service is ok. 
The Jollibee in Cebu was much better than this location."}
{"text":"I barely come here, maybe twice a year. There's no need to...since home cooked Filipino food is so much better...and there are wayyyy better choices out there than \"Filipino fast food.\"  When I do come here, Jollibee doesn't disappoint.  The chicken is great with gravy and white rice.  You can't go wrong with the Filipino spaghetti. It's a different take on your traditional spaghetti, it is sweet with hot dogs.  To top off the meal the peach mango pie is a real treat.  Don't forget to take a picture with the bee!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 33/100***

Personally I've always been a McDonald's kind of girl growing up in the Philippines, unfortunately for me McDonald's in the US doesn't serve fried chicken and rice lol. I go to Jollibee on a rarity because first of all, the wait time for your food is always ridiculous be it dine in or take out regardless of the amount you're ordering it seems, and second because the food is beyond mediocre it's laughable. The chicken joy which supposedly is their money maker and star is pretty bad, most times I wonder if it's actually even chicken, it's comparable to Popeye's chicken but Jollibee's is a grease trap and not at all appetizing, although I have to admit I love the crispy skin.  

The spaghetti is ok for fast food quality I guess, the palabok not so much. My Husband and son likes their Yumburger with cheese mostly for the sauce but God knows what that is made of too lol. The halo-halo is never consistent either, we ordered 2, one was decent with just the right amount of ice and sweetness and the other was a total fail. Their peach mango pies are their only saving grace in my opinion.  

The lack of quality aside though, Jollibee will always thrive because there are tons of Filipinos who flock their locations for nostalgic reasons. Their brand represents the core values of Fiipinos, the importance of family and togetherness, a sense of belonging that no matter where you end up in the world you'll always have that little piece of home when you eat there. So with that being said, I'm sure I will still find myself coming back at one point."}
{"text":"Since I have always liked fried chicken, I knew I had to try this place. Having read many reviews on yelp and talking to my Filipino friends I decided to try this place. But I was not going to wait in those massive lineups. So I  waited for the hype to die down.

I went on a Thursday afternoon around 400pm and the wait was about 15mins. They make you wait in this tent outside. You are presented with a menu and you place your order. They give you another form which you take inside and place your order. This is a busy place inside but it was organized chaos! Everyone had a role behind the counter and it looked like a well oiled machine. I was impressed, many smiling faces

Food (3/5)

I ordered the 6 piece bucket. It came with 3 sides and 3 peach/mango pies. The sides I got were French fries, mashed potato and corn. The chicken ordered was the spicy chicken. It was really good, the chicken was the star of the show. The sides were bland, nothing special. The peach/mango pie was okay.

It's a good place to eat some fast food when your in the area, is the lineup worth it?! No! 

They of course have other items also but spaghetti does not appeal to me in a Filipino fast food place."}
{"text":"Not really a great Filipino restaurant but hey you can't expect much from any fast food joint anyway. When I'm craving Filipino food but in a rush this is the place I go. Not the greatest menu. Honestly, I only like the palubok with their chicken combo. The chicken taste great especially when dipped in that gravy sauce they give along with it.

If you've never tried Filipino food, I suggest going to an authentic Filipino dine in restaurant.  I don't want you to think this is how Filipino food is supposed to taste like. 3 stars! Can't really complain since it is a fast food joint. The McDonald's of Filipino food."}
{"text":"I miss Jollibee so
Much and I have to come back. 
Twice already since the opening day."}

The McDonald's of the Philippines. Also know as Filipino fast food. 

I usually bring friends and family from out of town here who don't have a Jollibee in there area. 

Because there are so many Filipino restaurants in Vegas now, I don't come here as often. 

When I do (usually when I need something from Seafood City) I will stop in for the Ube or Buko Pandan smoothie (with boba) and the Peach Mango or Langka pies.  

My other favorite and one dish I recommend trying here is the Filipino style Spaghetti. Comes with hot dog slices and cheese. The sauce is sweeter than Italian or Americanized Spaghetti. 

As of July 2016, they currently have a Pineapple Float. Limited time offer."}
{"text":"I thought the art of horrible hospitality in the food industry was a form left to perfection in the Philippines and parts of Thailand...didn't think the dark cloud of attention lacking lethargy would follow a Filipino fast food chain straight across our border and into the heart of Las Vegas.

Anyway, been here twice when I've craved a buko pandan shake and this was the only place to snag one (til I franchise my own Zagu). Both times consisted of customers waiting and waiting for their food with no one placing an order...which means they had adequate time to catch up if they were truly in the weeds (which it looks like they shouldn't have been). Read: Extremely slow help...took 10 minutes to get my shake.

The second time I came in was last Tuesday when they were about to close for a buko pandan to go...got my shake and realized there was a huge baseball sized object in my cup...hey look, an iceberg...no really...a huge baseball sized brick of ice. Was the person that oblivious to what they poured into the cup or did they think it was just for some child who wouldn't speak up?

I went back the following week and showed the manager the pic on my phone and explained what happened...she immediately made another and apologized. Star added for quickly correcting last week's foul but I think it's time I buy my own pandan syrup and coconut milk and create my own...not returning for a third strike."}
{"text":"Can you say bland? Ideally I'd give Jollibee a 2.5 star rating (mainly since the wife seems to like it). Their food isn't bad...or good...it's...food. The service was OK... the chicken was apparently fried on the surface of the sun (still waiting to see if my taste buds will come back to life) and the sides were forgettable. Reminds me of eating in a school lunchroom..."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is nothing special. The entire experience is like (what I would imagine would be) going to an \"American Fast Food\" joint in the Philippines. Which is kitsch and cute, but we're not in the Philippines, and there's both better Filipino food and American food readily available nearby."}
{"text":"What a joke. Everytime I come here I'm greeted with \"hello, just so you know, chicken will take 15 minutes\" 15,20,25 minutes later you get your food. I'm thankful for the fact they have jollibee here jn Vegas but come on! Service at the Maryland location is better."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place, so when I was in the neighborhood I decided to check it out. I walked-in and seen just one culture. I felt odd honestly, like I was being stared at. I was the only white girl that was in there lol. I walked out.. I don't know why it seemed to bother me so much, but it did. 

Years later I returned to try again. I have lived a very closed in life when it comes to trying different cultures of food. On the menu they had Bangus (Which I don't know what that is) Fiesta noodles, that looked like fish and meats on the top of the noodles. 

Since I am a scary cat, I decided I wanted to taste something I know..A burger. I ordered the Big Yum. It was a very soft burger. I know that sounds funny, but I don't know another way to explain it. Like the meat was soft. Makes me think of what kind of meat I was eating? It was a different taste.  They didn't skip on condiments! Big A+ there! 

I am making it a goal to try different foods. So many restaurants in Vegas and I always seem to go to the same places and the same foods. I want to go back to Jollibee and try the chicken next."}
{"text":"I was never really in to Jollibee and didn't see the big deal to it.  But, every time I mention that we have them in Las Vegas to some of my friends, they make such a big fuss over it.  I stumbled in to this one a few months back and was not very impressed.  I had their palabok and chicken dish with coke for beverage.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Their food is overpriced, not worth the money.  I actually thought that McDonald's is better to go back to.  That's a sad comparison.

My cousin came over to my house one time and brought over Jollibee from this same restaurant.  He got the spaghetti, pies, and forgot what else.  I was actually more impressed with it that time.  The spaghetti was really tasty and the flavors were impressive.  The balance between salty and sweet was perfect.  I wondered if it's just a hit and miss.

Today, I went back and used the drive through.  It's very slow and employees look a little depressed and unhappy to be serving me.  Maybe I just looked like I was not worth serving.  Who knows?  I ordered the JolliHotDog and Spaghetti because of the good impression I had in my mind from when my cousin came over with one.  I am convinced it's a hit and miss.  My hot dog was not worth $2.58.  The sauce they put on there with the cheese and banana sauce didn't go well together.  I give that a thumbs down.  The spaghetti was lacking the same taste as the one my cousin brought over.  I was disappointed once again.  It just didn't have that taste.

If I didn't have Jollibee again, it wouldn't make a difference.  I think this restaurant didn't give me the feeling of wanting more.  It was just \"eh!\""}
{"text":"I'll rate it 3 for the slow service but I'll come back here anyway. Lol you should still go back because this is the only Jollibee in the west side. I guess you can go to the one by seafood but it's so busy out there. I hate going to the strip. You will always be in business Jollibee regardless of my rating. Filipinos love Jollibee!"}
{"text":"The manager was very nice. So as the crew who fixed my order. They accommodate my request for changing my orders. Thanks so much for the great service."}
{"text":"Came here because I was in a hurry and needed something quick. Bought the 2 piece meal with a side of mashed potatoes and drink. Never been here before so didn't know what to expect. The service was great they give you a buzzer to pick up your food and their is plenty of seating. What I didn't like so much was the food. The chicken was crunchy but wasn't flavorful and the mashed potatoes were sweet which caught me off guard. Overall the people here were great all were working and one was even mopping the floor."}
{"text":"My friend and I and my baby went here yesterday..while we were ordering our food my friend was holding my 2 year old toddler and sat her on the counter for a while, while we finish ordering our food.. the cash register \" Jasmine\" took our order and she seem unhappy , lil moment later i heard her say \" oh shit!\" infront of my toddler because my kid accidentally wrote something on the counter menu board ( which i wipe it off to remove the marks and it did remove like it never happen) she didnt even say \"thats ok or ill take care of that\" which i dont even want her to take care of it since its my kids fault to write in there .. but whats annoying and very aggravating is that i dont even cuss in front of my 2 year old girl and she have the guts to loudly say \"shit\" wow.. I was looking for the manager but you know what never mind , the manager is missing in action anyway so I wont even bother wasting my time having this conversation with her.. well as much as we love jollibee we are not going back on this branch ever!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through the other day and ordered the spicy chicken. The order taker Jerlyn was amazing. She was very knowledgeable courteous and friendly. I saw a previous negative review about their spicy chicken which is funny to me because why order spicy chicken if you don't want it spicy?!?!? No Jollibee is not trying to kill you dear. It is merely honoring your request. Keep up the good work Jollibee!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. It's the first Jolibee in Toronto and after more than two months, the wait is less. Another franchise will open up at the big Filipino grocery Surf City in Mississauga.

Finally got into Jolibee in Scarborough. Burgers (even without a slice of pineapple) still better than MickeyDs, but not as good as Five Guys, chicken ok still like Popeyes and the polabok just ok. There are better home made meals. But man those mango pies very good. If you're looking for the typical fried rice, egg and longonissa combo it ain't here. $"}
{"text":"I grew up in the Philippines so coming here is pretty much to satisfy my nostalgia more than anything. Ordered spaghetti and a jolly hotdog. I'm a little biased with Jollibee though so I have to give it 3 stars. It hasn't changed since I was a kid so middle road. I wasn't disappointed and wasn't super amazed either. Just satisfied."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Jollibee in Daly City, the PI and this location in Las Vegas as well as the one on the east side of town. So for this location 3 Stars for the Food, it's Hit or Miss, Never Consistent. 1 Star for Service; compared to the PI, I miss the Hundreds of Employees offering their Help and Eagerness to Clean and take your Trash, but here It takes them Forever to take your order and it takes Longer than that to get your food. -5 Stars, that's right Negative 5, for their Lack of AC, ESPECIALLY during the Summer! We first assumed it was just Broken, but after Several of Years of them being in business and experiencing Hot Oven like conditions, we're now Speculating they have a Crappy AC system or they are just a bunch of Cheapskates for not wanting to pay their Electric Bill! It's Las Vegas for goodness sakes! We live in a Desert, it gets to 120 degrees in the Summer! Heck even all the Jollibees in the PI all seemed to have Sufficient AC!"}
{"text":"The good:
Fried Chicken
Chicken sotanghon (loved the glass noodles and broth)

The bad:
Tucino (deep fried, garlic rice no flavor, and egg that was cooked hours ago)
mashed potatoes (tasted worse than KFC's instant potatoes)
Corned beef (so salty)

An okay place if you want fast food and are in a rush, their fried chicken is very crispy and tender juicy deliciousness."}
{"text":"Toronto is finally about to be blessed with its own Jollibee, but I'm so glad the visit to this Vegas location gave me something to look forward to. Cause the legends are true! Had the two piece Chicken Joy and spaghetti combo and they paired so well together that I don't know how I can eat either of those two on their own again. The chicken was juicy on the inside like it was weeping cause it knows how good it tastes. And the outside was crunchy but not oily. The Filipino-style spaghetti was sweet but not so much so that it tasted like dessert, or maybe I'm just accustomed to the Filipino-ness of it. Leveled up with the halo halo which was just ok. The ingredients didn't taste that fresh. But that's ok cause the main stars at this place aren't eaten through a straw."}
{"text":"Food is good here but the service is so slow!!!!! Every Filipino food establishment I've been to has always inefficient service. Food is awesome just service is always slow. Goldilocks as well has inefficient service. Do they go to the same food server college?"}
{"text":"Wow I waited 20 mins for a 3pc & 2 sides the chicken wasn't ready but wen it was ready they were serving the customers that came after me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was So p-o!!!!! It was the worst service & to the Mgr I seen I with ur attitude smh only if u knew!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this branch ever since it opened.  Food is great especially when your craving for Jollibee. Location is great since there are not too much Filipino food options around the area. Service was great, and I am sure it will still be but this was not the case this morning.  

We came in as they opened at 7am before heading to work.  My son wanted their chicken but they told us chicken isn't ready for another 25 minutes, I am assuming they still need to fry a batch since they just opened.  My son went for a little alternative and just wanted to eat rice and gravy.  Well supposedly they do not sell gravy and you aren't able to get a side of gravy without ordering the chicken.  So we asked for the manager and she said the exact same thing.  I told her well we do not have time to wait for the chicken and it's not really my fault that their chicken wasn't available in the first place and that we have ordered a side of gravy before.  Her response was \"Well not under my management.\"

So we just brushed what happened off and just carried on and waited for our order.  Well it didn't stop there.

As many know, Jollibee isn't that big of a place.  So if somebody is talking crap in their kitchen, you can hear it out front.  And that's what happened.  The manager started talking crap about us.  I couldn't hear the entire conversation but a couple things popped out. It was in tagalog but she said customers think we owe them something and why would they say its not their fault that the chicken is not done, is it my fault they didn't order chicken?  

I called her back out and told her that its not right to be talking about customers like that, and if she does choose to do so, do it in the office and not where everybody can hear her.  

Her response... \"Thank you for your feedback.\"

I apologize Jollibee for the bad rating,  you are a great place and I am sure I will come back later on but one bad apple can affect the rest of the bunch."}
{"text":"Apparently tonight the cash register girl is deaf because she didn't take my order right. Forgot to add in what I asked for."}
{"text":"This was probably the last time I will enjoy Jollibee.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted great but you can almost feel your arteries clogging up from the unhealthiness of it all.

If I didn't give two cents about eating healthy, I would eat here all the time.  They have the best fried chicken.  KFC, Popeyes .... whatever .. doesn't come close to Jollibee's.  
Of course they are renowned for their palabok.. it is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"There has to be a good reason my parents would never let me eat at Jollibee when I was little.  They always told me the burgers are made of worms. Somebody gave me a burger from Jollibee and I would not touch it.

This is a Filipino fast-food joint. It's like the Filipino Mickey D's. It's not fusion or anything. Filipino, Filipino, Filipino! Pinoy! From the food to the old ladies that cut in line in front of you. And no, this is definitely not the best burger anywhere. Whoever says that it is is a liar...just because you saw Jollibee in Bourdain's show, doesn't mean you have to believe it. I would not recommend a Jollibee burger to anyone.

I've had their Chicken Joy and that's alright.  I'm not a fan of Filipino spaghetti with the sweet sauce and red hotdogs (also made with worms according to my folks). The only thing I like from this place is Peach Mango Pie.

Years later...parentless and living in Vegas...feeling like a rebel, I finally got the urge to try their burger. It's one of those \"The Prodigal Son\" moments where I was like \"I should've listened to my parents\". Pack this!"}
{"text":"Came here today. Waited for 30 mins on Friday morning. Paid $62 for 1 bucket of chicken, 2 order of 3 pcs chicken combo, 1 kids jolly meal, 3 peach mango pie and 2 pcs yum burger. Hands down to yum burger as it taste like back home. Pineapple juice taste too sweet and too diluted. Peach mango pie is just okay (don't know what the hype is all about), french food fries has no salt, chicken doesn't taste the same as back home. Spicy chicken is too spicy for my liking (mind u i like spicy food). Took the food home, ate 1/4 of it and the leftover went straight to fridge. Dont know when we will eat it again. Honestly, i didn't enjoy the food. Probably will come back 1 year after.
Suggestions: i hope they would offer white meat/rib part of chicken. Not a lot of people is a fan of dark meat just saying."}
{"text":"I love jollibees!
After having jollibees in the philippines, I had withdrawal. I made sure to make it a point to eat here while we were on vacation in Las Vegas.

I ordered the Chicken with gravy and spaghetti combo, and it was delightful! Everything I ordered was hot and fresh, so that was a plus.
My friend ordered the palabok (type of noodle), and it was pretty good!

I just wish they had a chain here in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Everyone should know (at least my fellow Filipinos should, anyway) that fast food restaurant with the red-and-yellow bumblebee as a mascot. Jollibee is a must if you're craving Filipino-style fried chicken, which I admit is better than all the fast food chains serving fried chicken.

I ordered the C1 combo (two pieces of fried chicken, your choice of a side, and a drink). I decided to get one spicy and one mild to taste the difference. Everything was at the perfect temperature. The chicken was what I was expecting from Jollibee, tender and juicy. The skin (the best part) was crunchy and flavorful. The spicy chicken was actually spicy; it tasted more on the sweet side which went well with the heat of the spices. The mild chicken was the same, juicy and full of flavor. Honestly, I'll just stick to ordering the mild chicken because the spiciness can be a bit overbearing (it lingers on your tongue a lot longer than usual).

This place will probably be packed when you visit, so if you're dining in you better grab a seat fast! Employees weren't really the nicest and there were flies in the dining room (which we had to shoo away periodically), but I think if you're craving some good chicken then you should venture on inside the Seafood City market and order some Jollibee."}
{"text":"My favs: 
Spaghetti 
Chicken sotanghon - glass noodles are great
Buko Pearl cooler



Its good for some quick Pilipino cuisine craving. However, I prefer Popeye's for fried chicken."}
{"text":"First off their parking situation is horrible! I decided to not walk a 1/4 mile and go drive thru. Bad decision. The woman taking my order could barely hear me and kept asking me to repeat my order. I wasn't even far from the box and was basically screaming! I got to the window and was then informed that it would take an additional 7 minutes for my chicken fingers. Well I ended up having to wait about 12 minutes. They lock the dive thru window after 'helping' you and you have to knock on the window for help. They don't have their sides or drink options listed on their menu. How am  I to know what sides to choose from? Overall horrible customer service and very rude.

After waiting way too long in the empty drive thru I started to eat my food. Wow it's flavorless. My fried chicken wasn't very crispy and very bland! The French fries were gross. They could have benefitted from a small sprinkling of salt or something. The chicken strips that I waited for were also flavorless. I was highly disappointed with my overall experience! I would not go back!"}
{"text":"Just awful! Stick to what you know! I gave this place a chance because I was hungry before a movie...and it sucked!  I was fooled by their cute mascot but you don't have to!"}
{"text":"It is a filipino fast food chain and I have always loved their fried chicken, since its the only thing I have ever ordered there.

The chicken is very crunchy (which I love about it) and juicy.  I usually get mines with a side of rice and either fries or corn.  If you like Popeye's then maybe you should give this fast food chain a try.  Also, while you eat your food you can even enjoy some filipino tv shows inside Jollibee.

Lastly, the service and the prices are A-OK."}
{"text":"Oh my! Are those Vienna sausages in my sweet spaghetti? That was my first reaction when I went to Jollibee in the Philippines. Just like how the Philippines are an amalgamation of different cultures and cuisines, the menu here reflects that in fast food form. The fried chicken is not the best but cheap. The spaghetti sauce is similar to ketchup. Their boba is fresh, warm, and sweet. Lacks the chewiness and the drink unsettled my stomach for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"MABUHAY! After waiting two months, we finally managed to visit Jollibee.  Went there on a weekday lunch, and thank god there wasnt much of a lineup. From start to finish it took 30 min, which is better than the 2 hour wait times a month ago.  I agree with other yelpers on their comments about the controlled chaos.  They had this whole system worked out perfectly, and i was quite impressed. We ordered the fried chicken, spaghetti, cheese burger and peach mango pie.

Fried chicken: it had the same crunch as popeyes but the inside was moist, flavour was okay

Spaghetti: if you guys dont know yet, filipino spaghetti is more on the sweet side compared to your normal italian spaghetti.  But this particular spaghetti was toned down a bit.  I guess they didnt want non-filipinos  to get turn off by too much sweetness. It had your typical hotdog and cheddar white cheese, which are all traditional filipino spaghetti ingredients.

Cheese burger: this one was my least favourite.  The meat patty was dry. Their secret sauce (mayo/ketchup) was in one spot, so i didnt taste it through out the whole burger.

Peach/mango pie: i am not a big fan of anything peach, but this pie was awesome. The mango and peach was a perfect blend and worked good together.  This was my favourite from our order.

Overall i was satisfied with our visit, when i first set my foot in the store, it felt like i was back home.  It satisfied my cravings for filipino fast food, and something that us filipinos can call our own. MABUHAY!"}
{"text":"The chicken I tried years ago might still be lovely..if I felt like waiting 20 minutes for it. I only drove this distance because my kid saw Jollibee on buzzfeed and wanted to try it herself. Next time I'll say no lol. She thought the burger steak she ordered was okay...not much flavor."}
{"text":"We came for a dinner with my kids and it was damn HOT, considering it is 110F outside. Freaking CHEAP management, so uncomfortable to eat.

If you can go somewhere, please don't visit this place  at this time of the year!!!"}
{"text":"Worth the lines! We went later in the evening on a Thursday and waited for about 20 minutes. There seems to be a line every evening but as of now it shouldn't be more than a 30 minute wait. They're extremely organized and hand you a number once you line up. In line you'll get a menu to look over and someone will come by to take your order on a slip that you'll hand to the cashier. 

Combining the two times I've been there I've tried most of the menu. The chicken is AMAZING, much more juicier and flavoured than the usual fried chicken chains. The spaghetti is great, more sweet in flavour than savoury. The mash potatoes really blew me away considering I wasn't expecting much. And definitely sub in the pineapple drink instead of a pop. The burger steaks with rice is basic but I highly enjoyed it. The palabok fiesta looks just like it does on the menu but wasn't loaded with flavour. Overall the portions are huge and they aren't stingy with the fried chicken! 

FYI they currently have a $50 (before tax) and 2 bucket limit per person."}
{"text":"Having a birthday party for my lovely daughter today! Helping spear head what food to serve, I IMMEDIATELY wanted to have the spaghetti and Palabok FIESTA!!
Why?! Because (A) the spaghetti is fxcking good. And (B) the palabok is FXCKING GOOD! So I placed my pre order for the party trays about two days ago and now I'm here picking it up...JOLLIBEE IS FXCKING GOOD!! Stop reading!! GO EAT!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to brag...was crowded, was only 2/3 in line ahead but moved very fast. I ordered daily special some extra rice 2 peach mango pie I for got to take pictures but everyone was nice friendly the food was fresh and hot I only waited maybe 15 minutes for my order and I was out the door"}
{"text":"Not a lot of filipino places but when i saw I had a Jollibee next to my place I was kinda stoked.  Just because I knew if I wanted to get Filipino Food, I could.  i didn't have to wait for my aunt to go come to town or for my cuz to make filipino spaghetti!  My boyfriend actually likes the sweet potato fries because they are spicy and sweet.  They could be spicier but it's still good.  Plus, seeing the big Bee outside is pretty funny!  Service is great, unlike some other filipino places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tapsilog is  but cmon guys. Clean windows and floor is sticky. I'm a jollibee connoisseur having lived in PH eating burger steak as often as I can. Keep up the quality of the food but take some time in cleaning. I come in early in the morning so it should be clean around this time right? I mean it's honestly as clean as the jollibee in the PH but then again that statement isnt a compliment. US stores should have higher standards. Also the one-time no refill drinks isn't popular. A small store can do unlimited refills but jollibee with multiple store locations can't? Why is that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Filipino fastfood restaurant together with red ribbon. Im always here and craving for anything that is on their menu. Everytime I come in here I would order something different that I haven't tried yet and it just keeps going down the list, lol. Love it!"}
{"text":"Tastes authentic to the Jollibees in Manila. 

We had the chicken, mashed potatoes, sundae, mango pie and pineapple drink. 

Very friendly staff.
There are so many people that they put up a tent for the line. Sometimes the line can be 1hr+ wait.

I hope the management contacts me as I could solve their operations problem."}
{"text":"I kinda grew up on this stuff when I lived in the Philippines for a short time. So, this is pure excitement and nostalgia for me. My nearest Jollibee is 3 states north and about a 4-hour (non rush hour) drive away, which means I HAD to take advantage of the proximity of this one during my visit to Vegas.

This is among three Filipino eating establishments in the Seafood City supermarket -- the other two are Red Ribbon and Chowking. Judging from the lines, they're all obviously popular eateries.

I wanted a 2-piece chicken joy, but they were only serving 1-piece chicken joys. So, I ordered that. My friend wanted a chicken sandwich, but they were all out of sandwiches and anything else he wanted to order. I'm not sure what the food shortage was all about, but it's very strange for a food place to run out of stuff they're known for. For now, I could only rate it 3 stars because it didn't have much variety. Hopefully, I'll get another chance to go there and all their food will be available for purchase."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try Jollibee found one in a shopping grocery store for Filipinos this spaghetti was awesome the gravy with support and the chicken was not to be compared with Popeyes but the customer service was awesome"}
{"text":"My favorite fried chicken fast food. Can't compare their fried chicken to other fast food. The place is clean and friendly crew. I come here weekly just to buy their Yay promo. My favorite yay is Weds-yay... 2 buckets of chicken joy for $15 whoorah.."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm Filipino who grew up in the Philippines so i come here for a quick bite and comfort food. but i can honestly say the service is just down right disrespectful and god-awful. the food isn't even great and they 3 out of 5 times they get the order wrong. but hey, still great chicken."}
{"text":"In and Out with my Fried Chicken in 15 minutes! 

Jolly Crispy Chicken (Spicy) 2 pc Combo with Pineapple Drink and Corn
Jolly Spaghetti 
Peach Mango Pie

Crispy Chicken is the bomb! Love how moist the meat was and the skin so crunchy without being oily! Both pieces were of good size. The spicy powder on the skin was tasty. No, not really my level of spiciness but really enjoyable!

Spaghetti was a missed for me. For $4.99, I could not expect much. The pasta was cooked al dente which did not turn soggy at all. Hot dog in sweet tomato sauce.....

Fortunately, that Peach Mango Pie saved the day!! The crust was so good and this should make McD's feels ashame of their Apple Pie. A happy ending to any meal.

There was only handful of people in line in front of me when I arrived. I would wait 15 to 20 minutes for this but hours?!?! I am happy to come again if the wait is short. They are much better than other Fast Food Fried Chicken: KFC and even Popeyes."}
{"text":"Wednesday special - 12 pieces for $12.99

I love their Wednesday deal. I usually get my craving for fried chicken in the middle of the week so it's perfect timing for us. The chicken is never too greasy or dry. It's always full of flavor and juicy, the way fried chicken should be.

We've been here a few times when it was really busy and we had to wait at least 45 mins for the chicken to be done. When it's that busy then my boyfriend will wait while I go get a few things from Seafood City. On our last visit, I was surprised that there was only a couple of customers ahead of us and we waited less than five minutes. 

There's a KFC near me but I'd rather drive the 25 mins to Jollibee's."}
{"text":"Moist, succulent pieces of fried dark meat chicken! I love chicken joy, my fatty self loves drowning the chicken meat in the gravy...the skin needs to be appreciated in its fullest, crispiest form without the gravy.  Even the little spam biscuits with mayonnaise are surprisingly tasty.  There is nothing healthy here that I can see....but bad food is my pleasure."}
{"text":"If theres any other way to describe it, its that it reminds me of my childhood when I would celebrate my bdays @ the jollibee in philippines.

I say 5 stars because of the customer service, the food, and the ambience.

Customer service with a jolly smile! You'll feel really welcomed soon as you come in. And when you exit, you are greeted by \"Have a Jolly Day Mam/Sir\"

Food: well tastes very much just like home! Super crunchy n delicious Fried Chicken. Gravy to go with it thats nowhere near as salty as the bigger chain fried chicken places. Ask any filipino and they'll say that nothin compares to the flavourful gravy. Ever had filipino spaghetti? Yes, its got the sauce thats on the sweeter side with tonnes of hot dogs n ground meat. N cant forget... PEACH MANGO PIE. For dessert. Crunchy, steamy, n scrumptuously delish. Dont leave Jollibee without having a PMP.

Overall this place makes dining in much more enjoyable and that Bee just makes you wanna dance you beehind off."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, finally!  After all these years, I finally got the opportunity to go to Jollibee!  

I didn't really feel like eating the fried chicken, so I got staple - tocino and eggs.  Delicious.  Heaping pile of rice, tons of tocino, yummy eggs - perfection!  They also have vinegar and soy sauce available at the front, so that's always perfect to top the rice with or dip the tocino in.

What really caught my eye on the menu were the lil slider sandwiches.  They had everything that brought me back to my childhood - corned beef, spam, egg.  It's like, this is what my Dad used to make me go to school with for lunch...seriously.  I couldn't resist and also got the spam slider - which really tasted like my childhood.  Oh, good times.

Oh, and they had an ube freeze/slushie thing.  Food coma, yo.  But, sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars for several reasons. The main one being I scored a tickets from friends and got in after 15 minutes of waiting in line. Second, this place is as delicious as the Jollibee from back in the Philippines. And third, despite how busy they were, service was very efficient. 

I was very happy with everything I had. And trust me, I had a lot. Would like to come back when it calms down. Probably wont be for a while though."}
{"text":"I HATE this Jollibee!!!!!!! I come to Vegas once a year and for the last two years they messed up my order!   Both years I asked for a cheeseburger plain just meat and cheese only. Any mcdonalds could get that right. But no jollibee can't. They had the nerve to tell me plain just means no sause and I have to say cheese only!!!  And then they take it back in back and wait fiv minutes an bring it back out with everything just wiped off with the sauce smeared all over still.  So never going back again!!! If you want anything plain or something different from them just go somewhere else becaus they don't have the brains to fix it for you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember.  Lol maybe I just don't crave Jollibee goodness anymore. The spaghetti wasn't as warm/hot as I expected and the gravy is bleh, kind of salty for me. Chicken was the saving grace, always good! The customer service is one of the best; they're always polite and courteous, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"We tried Jollibee for the first time tonight. We orders 2 3 piece combos with fries and mashed potatoes with gravy. The chicken was crispy & juicy. I appreciate anywhere that doesn't over cook and ruin fried chicken.  The mashed potatoes were cold. Like just came out of the fridge cold. My fries looked perfect, but were cold. It disappointing because they actually have a sign that says something about food being hot and being cautionary. My food was not. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"I loved Jollibee from the time I tried it in Seattle. So when I found one here of course I was going to go.  The fact it is it gives it an extra star it probably doesn't deserve. But hey they don't have them in Phoenix so.... 

Either way, this is a low rating for this place because honestly they try... but fail. The chicken is dry and not really that great. The palabok was okay but I felt kinda blah after eating it so I don't think it was really cooked right... or maybe it was the chicken. 

If they had screwed that up but gotten the halo-halo perfect I probably would have overlooked the bad and gave it 4 stars. But the halo-halo was not that great. I LOVE the amazing desert, but this was terrible. Everything was there, but the ice was so hard that it was nearly impossible to mix up (the whole point of it) Even half an hour later it was still really crunchy and still big chunks of unmixable \"shaved ice\""}
{"text":"The store is managed well and clean. The employees were very friendly. The chicken tasted fresh, crisp, and tasty. Overall a quick and easy meal! No complaints here."}
{"text":"Food was good, but they don't really listen to your order or say it back. So I didn't get my order correct. But again the chicken is good."}
{"text":"I was anticipating the long line up at the parking lot. However, the line took about ten minutes in which I was given a number. During the wait in the line up, someone was there to take you order on a slip of paper. Once you got inside, they let you pay at the counter and you are given a pager. There's a lot of people but when you go with someone, they can find a seat as you pay for the food.  

For $36, my husband and I ordered a six piece bucket of chicken, large mashed potato, large spaghetti, large gravy, two peach mangos and pineapple juice. The fried chicken was good but I felt that Chick n Joy is a little tastier. The mashed potatoes were creamy and I like how the gravy was mixed in. My favourite was the spaghetti because as I opened that red box, the smell and the taste brought me back to that one year I had gone to the Philippines and was taken to Jollibee so often. The pineapple drink was okay but it tasted like dole pineapple juice straight from the can (I probably wouldn't order it again). The peach and mango pies were the best and my husband was absolutely enamoured with it. He actually went back to buy four more for himself!

Overall, Jollibee was good in terms of the food they were serving and the service. The staff were friendly and very accommodating. They sometimes even went to go and clear your table and put your garbage away. The only thing that I wish they would improve on is the waste. Everything was packaged separately which resulted in a lot of garbage after food consumption."}
{"text":"Regular fast food. Nothing special. 

Its an attraction for expats from Filipins. 

Food 3/5 fried fast food. 
Service 3/5 they nice and friendly. But wait line is long and it's very hectic inside. NO wifi

Prices 3/5 $ 7 for fast food burger"}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit, I do not like the sweet sauce they put on their spaghetti.  That said, I hoped one of the other options would be edible.  It wasn't.  The Chicken Joy so many people rave about practically flooded my kitchen with grease when I bit into it.  The meat itself was poor quality and stringy.  They provided a very small bit of gravy for the chicken.  The gravy tasted like it was made with dirt.   The Hamburgers were overcooked but other than that they were typical fast food burgers.

The staff is very rude at this location and get impatient if you do not know your order when you walk up or if you ask any questions.

The restaurant itself always seems dirty, more than once we have had to switch tables because their was some sort of goo or food leftovers on them.

I tried to find some Joy in ChickenJoy but alas, my second trip was as bad as the first."}
{"text":"Jollibee over Mcdonalds any day !! Whatever you get to eat make sure to get the halo-halo afterwards or before lol.. It's simple and not as fancy other Filipino restaurant but keeping it simple goes a long a way and for the price.. I cant complain.."}
{"text":"The wait is finally over, Jollibee  has arrived in Toronto.  Heard about the hype and just had to grab some of the food. Got the crispy chicken and peach mango pies since I heard a lot about them .
The peach mango pies are very soft with a delicious filling of peach and mango in a crust. I haven't tasted anything like it before and it's worth bunch of tries.
The crispy chicken is quite good as well. It lives up to the hype  as the crispness of the chicken skin felt just right and I would put it up there with KFC fried chicken . And there was a good proportion of breading and skin as other restaurants sometimes add too much breading making it feel odd.  The meat itself is soft and tender. Definitely enough to make you want more.
That's all I got for this trip  since i am warchinf mu nutrition and will be returning to  this location to try other lovely items  or the Heartland  location which opens up as its close to me .
The restaurant is clean and very hospitable customer service. 
Jollibee  is great  and you must check it out asap.
Happy Easter Everyone"}
{"text":"I've always loved Jollibee, but this particular location is rather slow. The employees are less enthusiastic than McDonald's workers, and there seems to be little quality control at this location. 
I bought an uber slush yesterday, and the outside of the cup was smothered in gravy. How did the employee manage to get gravy on the outside of my drink???"}
{"text":"I like jollibee's it's really cheap to eat here and the spaghetti is awesome!! 
They always treat us like we are outcasts or something but we ignore and continue to eat here.  The burgers are not that good but everything else is yummy! 
Asking for a refill isn't ever fun here, they never give much ice and they make me feel like I'm annoying asking for more Pepsi!!

The chairs scrape on the floor which drives me nuts but maybe not to anyone else. 

The facility itself is pretty clean and bathrooms are
Clean. Hand soap is a little high for little ones though 

I would give them 5 stars if they were friendlier to us!!"}
{"text":"Went there with my best friend today (on a Saturday) apparently, they don't close at 11. They close at 10. Arrive there to order food at 9. My best friend was just making conversation with the cashier. From what the cashier says they close at \"9:30\". They really need to change the time on their door and on social media. 

Customer service was alright. Either way, I wasn't  expecting much from the reviews I read. 

Any who... Wanted to order Halo Halo but unfortunately they weren't available because they turned off the machines. Which I find kind of bullshit. I'm sure they just were too lazy and wanted to leave early. 

At least their food was still good & warm. Service needs a little bit of working."}
{"text":"Yummm love this place. Sends me back home to get that quick fix. Good customer service as always."}
{"text":"SO EXCITING!! I came by on a Friday afternoon 230p and I was still surprised that there was a line up. Didn't have to wait that long though, maybe about 20 mins total? Ordering food was smooth and straight forward. The store doesn't look that big from the outside but its quite spacious on the inside. Lots of seats avail. There is a max of $60 per person but we didn't get that much lol. Just ordered enough for my mom and I and we were STUFFED and didn't eat dinner till really late that night.

We got: palabok combo with spicy chicken
spaghetti combo with spicy chicken, upcharge to pineapple juice
1 yum burger
4 peach mango pies

Palabok.. wasn't that good imo. My friends made me some before and homemade tastes better.
Spaghetti was really good!! Lots of flavour and just enough portions.
Pineapple juice was refreshing, enjoyed this.
Spicy chicken I liked. Added a kick to it vs kfc/popeyes. It's crispy and tender.
Yum burger.. meh. I'd stick with mcdonalds mcdouble.
Pies = MY FAV! Must get!

They're opening a Jollibee in Mississauga soon so I'll most likely go to that one from now but maybe a year from when it opens.. will be way too congested to wait in line there."}
{"text":"I do not know why I ate here.. It was so hot inside and my food was cold. Do not get the chicken dippers, you could make it at home."}
{"text":"Food wasn't so quick, but a variety of things were offered besides the typical french fries and chicken or a burger. I think depending on how adventurous you are, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Fast and Fresh!  Filipinos eat rice with everything.  And it's good!  

I first discovered this place in 2000 when my dad took me to the Philippines.  Jollibee was all over the place!  I didn't quite get the weird hamburgers.  I didn't quite get the fried chicken and gravy.  But then.. it clicked!  I got the Filipino Spaghetti.  I got the pies..  and then I was turned onto the fried chicken.  Silly me.  

The Jollibee fried chicken is just like my mom would make at home with steamed rice.  The gravy from Jollibee, tastes like its made from a powder, was good with the chicken.  I was converted!  I was, dare I say, turned on.. by the chicken!  

Now, my 2 daughters and I go to Jollibee when we're at the Filipino market, or we're looking for the homestyle fried chicken and steamed rice.  They also make a yummy Pineapple Quencher..  Mango Peach pie..  YUMM..  And the Langka pie.  Get 'em and Eat 'em while they're fresh and HOT!  They're made the same way McDonalds used to make their apple pies back in the day.

So..  get the chicken, rice, gravy and pineapple quencher."}
{"text":"Love Jollibee! I'm so happy that they made it to Toronto! It's been years since I've had it and I was so excited to eat it again. First thing I ate was the burger steak, tastes exactly like how they made it back home! Had the pineapple juice.... so refreshing on a hot day! And of course, we ordered a bucket of the spicy chicken. It's my favourite thing on the menu. I love how it's actually spicy! It's nice and juicy and not oily like KFC or Popeyes. Can't forget about how delicious the gravy was! It was the perfect meal!!! I love Jollibee, I wish they opened more locations!"}
{"text":"I once did a case study on Jollibee, and it was about branching outside of Philippines and SE Asia.  Well, lo and behold there is one in Village Square!  I'm sure there must be one in L.A. somewhere but don't ever recall seeing one...  Anyhow, decided I would hop over for lunch just to see what it would be like.  And well, I like it!  Granted I only had one thing on the menu, but it's certainly off to a good start.

The place is pretty big, set up like a typical fast food joint but with more of a mickey mouse-like set-up.  I'm not sure what it was, maybe the big bee and the color and the plastic-y seating?  Anyway, thought it was quite interesting.  There are probably 30 tables inside, and at least a third of them were occupied with Filipinos, belying the poor rating from Yelp.  Traffic remained brisk during my stay, so I'm guessing they do okay.  The service was pleasant although not necessarily altogether sincere, I thought.  But, what more can you expect from teenage employees at fast food restaurants?

They messed up my order a bit - I ordered the 3 piece chicken with a side of fries, but received rice.  Okay, chalk that up to confusion between \"fries\" and \"rice\", which could sound similar.  The chicken was properly crispy and fresh, and quite good.  This is a departure from other reviews I read.  I am a fan of Popeye's because their chicken come crispy, and don't like KFC because theirs do not.  I would say Jollibee's chicken was crispier than Popeye's although I like the seasoning on Popeye's better.  So basically a wash between the two, which is a complement for Jollibee's.  And to the rice, not fries... Okay, the rice is typical rice.  But that gravy is delish!  Surely it must be half msg, but who cares!  I put the gravy over the rice and that was pretty irresistible.  

So there you have it, purely based on chicken & gravy, I'm giving it 3.5 stars.  Impressive for fast food.  I will eventually try some of their other stuff, including their Filipino dishes and the spaghetti.  Debated if I should give it 4 stars and work down from there, or 3 stars with a chance to work up.  Eh, don't think they'll work it up so I'll give it 4 for now."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite. I went here every day during my trip to Vegas and I'm still not tired of this place. The staff were nice. The only down side is there's only one washroom but other than that, everything else was good"}
{"text":"I finally made my way over to Jollibee to try their much talked about fried chicken. We ended up getting Bucket C ($43.99) which included 2 Jolly Crispy Chicken Buckets, 4 sides, 2 gravies, and 4 Peach Mango Pies. We also added on the Palabok Fiesta with a drink for $6.99.

The Palabok Fiesta consists of bihon noodles (very similar to thin rice vermicelli) topped with palabok sauce, pork chicharon bits, tinapa flakes, sauteed pork, shrimps, and a few slices of egg. I thought this dish was not bad. I liked the sauce which had a rich garlicy savory flavour with a slight sweetness of prawns; and the noodles were well cooked (not mushy or clumpy). However, I wasn't a huge fan of the chicharon bits which seemed a little hard; and the pork and two little pieces of shrimp lacked flavour.

What I did like was the Jolly Crispy Chicken. We got two different buckets - one regular and one spicy and found the only difference between the two is that one has a spicy powder sprinkled on top. Be warned - that powder packs quite a punch and would probably appeal to people who like a lot of heat! It's definitely recommended to pair the spicy chicken with the sweet pineapple juice which helps to tone down the spice. As for the chicken itself; it is extremely juicy and seems to be less salty and oily than most other chains. I liked how light and crispy they were able to get the skin without having that rancid, overly deep-fried flavour.

For the most part, the sides were average. The corn was lightly buttered and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy; but I would avoid the fries which I found to be bland and unappealing. However, the gravy that comes with the chicken was delicious and reminded me of St Hubert's gravy. I could drink the whole container on its own but it's probably a little more civilized to have it with the chicken or poured over rice/mashed potatoes.

The peach and mango pies had a nice crispy shell which was very impressive but I found the filling to be a bit sweet and artificial for my tastes.

Would I come back? Yes. But probably not until the crowds die down."}
{"text":"Love their spaghetti.All their food is good
I Service Very good. Everybody very friendly. Bakery is good."}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because the fries aren't that good. I like their version of spicy chicken compared to Popeyes which is heavily battered. I also tried the sweet spaghetti and I actually like it. The noodles were alright for me. I like the sweetness. Of course I tried the peach mango pie because I've been hearing it from friends, love it, the pie is so good, GOOD. Different from your Apple, blueberry, other berry pies served in McDonalds. The pineapple, juice, unsure if it's real, taste just like pineapple. I would definitely return. The price is appropriate to portion size. Service is excellent. Reminds me of how Asia is amazing at front line customer service compared to North American companies."}
{"text":"The food there was gross, and also the cashier was rude and didn't even give me the right amour of cash. I definitely don't recommend going here. The food is a little suspicious, I wasn't 100% sure of what I was eating."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've loved Jollibee since I was still in the Philippines. I would've given a 5 star if ONLY they don't have mistakes. Been here a couple times and they always forget something like fries. And then they get kinda snobby when you tell them they forgot to put fries and then they ask for the receipt without even smiling or apologizing. Weird. But it's okay because it was was busy. I just think they need to be better with their customer service and try their best not to forget a purchase. Overall, great food though."}
{"text":"Jollibee's fried chicken tastes \"just like\" Popeye's and much crispier than KFC's.  Two pieces of chicken per person will be sufficiently filling.  

Also their mango peach pies are lot better than varieties at McDonald's Canada. Pies did reminded me of pineapple pies in McDonald's in China.  

Overall, the fried chicken, mango peach pies are really exceptional.  Is it worth waiting long hours for? Not really.  I went on a weekday 5pm and only waited 20-25mins."}
{"text":"JOLLIBEE ALMOST KILLED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Last week Wednesday January 17,2018 I drove thru Jollibee on Sahara and fort Apache village square around 4pm I ordered 2 buckets of \"SPICY\" chicken and 3 side order of white rice. The girl even said that they have a special going on so instead of getting 1 bucket of chicken I got 2 buckets and I repeated twice over drive thru that I wanted it \"SPICY\" they even had me pull over on the side since the chicken wasn't ready yet. On my way home I stopped by Walgreens to pick up my medication because I had the flu then I got home around 5pm. When I got home I took my 2 medication that my doctor prescribe to me which I needed to take with food. I took 1 bite of my food and realize that it wasn't \"Spicy\" like what I ordered so I called the restaurant and the girl who took my order answered the phone, she tried to argue that I didn't say I wanted my chicken \"Spicy\" I told her that It's not my fault that she didn't hear me but I know I repeated it twice I know I ordered \"Spicy\" chicken, I told her I will wait for my bf then we will go back and replace it. I waited about 10 minutes until my bf got home then he drove me back to Jollibee since I was already drowsy from my 2 medication that I took previously. When we back to drive thru gave them the 2 bucket of chicken then they replaced it with \"Spicy\" chicken, or so I thought. When we got home I was already very drowsy from having no food in my system and medicated when I took my first bite of the food they gave us we realize that it was the same chicken we returned to them and they just put a bunch of \"Spicy\" powder on it that you couldn't even eat it!!!! It burned my stomach even more that I actually THREW UP AND PASSED OUT!!!!!!!!!!! When my bf called the SUPERVISOR ANSWERED.  MY BF ASKED IF THEY JUST GAVE US THE SAME CHICKEN AND PUT A BUNCH OF POWDER ON IT AND SHE ARGUED THAT SHE WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE ORDER AND THAT SHE NEVER HEARD ME SAY SPICY CHICKEN, MY BF HAD TO REPEAT HIMSELF SAYING \"THATS NOT WHAT I ASKED YOU, I ASKED YOU IF YOU JUST GAVE ME THE SAME CHICKEN AND JUST PUT A BUNCH OF SPICE ON IT, YOU CANT EVEN EAT IT ITS TOO SPICY. WE WERE BOTH SO UPSET AND THAT SUPERVISOR DIDNT GIVE A DAMN! I PASSED OUT THAT NIGHT MY BF HAD TO CALL THE AMBULANCE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS MEDICATED AND THAT SUPERVISOR GAVE ME SPICY CHICKEN THAT YOU CANT EVEN SWALLOW. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS AWARE OF WHAT THIS JOLLIBEE DID TO ME. I WAS PASSED OUT/PALE FROM 5 AT NIGHT UNTIL 3:45AM."}
{"text":"Great spot to get some good Filipino fast food. Located in Seafood City, it provides easy access for those coming in to buy groceries in the main market. The employees are friendly and kind. The food is always delicious and I constantly find myself coming back to it. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I really despise drive thrus but was curious about this place so I decided to go for it. I ordered a crispy chicken and was told 10 minutes for that, so I declined. 
They got my order wrong of course when I got to the window. 
The corned beef sandwich for $1.29 was tempting so I got 2. Really not bad at all, it tasted like that corned beef hash in a can I ate in college. Sort of tasty and spam like. 
Will return for a proper entree and skip the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Who'da thunk that something soooo American as Fried Chicken would be best served by Philipinos?

The fried chicken is nothing short of fantastic... which is something rarely found at fast food restaurants, especially the places that specialize in it (KFC, Churches, or Popeyes).  

I've had some of their other items in the past which weren't bad, but not so amazing either... but I'll go out of my way to get Jollibee chicken every time!"}
{"text":"I just loved coming here when I was growing up as a kid. There's just some Filipino pride coming out of me when I come here to eat with family or friends. The yum burger is my favorite item to get from here. Also there halo-halo is the Bomb! Filipino pride y'all."}
{"text":"I've never had an issue and their food is good for a fast food filipino chain.  Flavor is good, but I gave it 3 stars because I ordered a 3 piece chicken joy meal and only got 2 piece chicken.  I checked the receipt and was charged for 3 and unfortunately I didn't check the box until after I got home (to go order)."}
{"text":"my fav restaurant ever since i was a kiddd..:) lovee love their chicken wit gravy..and their rice wit corn beef for breakfast..yum yumm.."}
{"text":"I am Filipino and I am proud to be one, I give jollibee 5 stars because I am not a hypocrite, I will admit I EAT at jollibee because my kid is crazy about chicken joy and every time I feel nostalgic for my country of birth i come here. So I do not know why there are so many haters out there rating this place so low when they keep coming back here anyways... You know who you are... And why even bother to write a review...just to prove that you are above jollibee? FYI KFC in the same complex closed down... I think this is because jollibee was getting all the business instead. So don't listen to all those haters (especially if you are Filipino) go ahead and indulge yourself in the crispy skin of chicken joy and the yummy sweet spaghetti. Go ahead and relive your childhood days of yore..."}
{"text":"In the area for an appointment, we were trying to find something quick to eat at 10:30 in the morning and didn't want IHOP, so we decided to give Jollibee a shot. I've been to Jollibee in So Cal before, but never to one here in town. I've never been a huge fan, but figured I'd give them another shot.

I got the spam breakfast and it was ok. The best thing about this place is that everything is so cheap, even for fast food. Nothing amazing but it satiated our craving for a quick and cheap meal while we were in the area. Good for what it is, cheap fast food."}
{"text":"We had tried coming to Jollibees at least 5x but there were always lineups of at least an hour and tents for people! So we came today and there was only a 20 min line up and even seating. Ordered a fried chicken, spaghetti, mango peach pie, pineapple juice and a burger. Came out to around $25 which is reasonable. The service was great, very friendly staff. The fried chicken was very fresh, reminded is of Popeyes and the skin was very crispy. The spicy one was really spicy! Gravy has a good flavour and different. Tried their spaghetti, it is quite sweet with sausages and minced meat and roasted red pepper taste. The pie was a bit disappointing, very artificial mango sauce taste but like McDonald's. The pineapple juice was nothing extraordinary and very sweet. The burger tasted like a McDonald's burger but nothing too special either. It is a bit overhyped and reminded me of Mcdonalds. The chicken  though was very very tasty."}
{"text":"Jollibee has always been one of my favorite restaurants especially as a kid (I have pictures to prove it haha). I usually get the spaghetti with the chicken joy, and a couple of their peach mango pies. It doesn't say it on the menu, but it is possible to ask for a specific chicken piece (like a drumstick), and also ask to have a spicy piece of chicken instead, at no extra charge. The peach mango pies are a delightful dessert treat especially since you can't really get them from anywhere else (have you ever heard of such a thing at another restaurant? I bet not). 

It was a little busy when we went so the lady at the front mixed up our order a little, but they were quick to correct their mistake, and apologized profusely (like a true Filipino). Great customer service and even better food."}
{"text":"Jollibee is an okay place to eat.  It isn't my first choice in most respects but I do so adore their breakfast offerings which are far and away something different than grabbing a McWhatever or some other kind of bread, egg and sausage sandwich.  I can have fish for breakfast or longanisa with rice and when the family is away, this might not be Lola's cooking but it definitely is good enough to make yours truly content."}
