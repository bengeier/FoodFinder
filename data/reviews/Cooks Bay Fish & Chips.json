{"text":"Brutal. Go to the place in Newmarket instead. 100X better! It's called chip and malt and it's the best fish and chips iv ever had!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Standard pricing for a Fish and Chips place. 1 halibut and chips are $10.99. We opted for the 2 can dine special for $28.99 (comes with 4 deep fried shrimp, 8 deep fried scallops, a halibut and chips per person, 2 coleslaw and 2 drinks. For the value, it's a decent price but I was very disappointed in the quality. The halibut was okay, \"chips\" were bland, coleslaw came in a small half-cup. When we got the dishes, I glanced at the \"special's menu\" and laughed because it looked better in the photo. The scallops and shrimp were cooked from frozen (scallops were minuscule in size).   Facility: Quiet and homey, kind of like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen.  Washrooms are okay (only 1 for men, 1 for women). Located off Holland St, convenient but hard to spot.  The sign by the street says \"Cook's Bay\" but the sign over the door says \"English Fish and Chips\".   Service: Service... was well service. Nothing extraordinary.  Asian run (if that matters to anyone).   Overall: Okay, probably wouldn't come back. The experiences was underwhelming but not bad."}
{"text":"Tr√®s bon fish and chips au centre-ville de Bradford.  C'est un petit resto de quartier et c'est pas cher."}
{"text":"Nice fish portion and the fries were very nice. Venue is simple but the entry door creates drafts even with the \"airlock\" that was added. Not pretentious in any manner. Primarily geared towards take out service with nine tables. No alcohol served as far as I can see. Reasonable about of parking available."}
