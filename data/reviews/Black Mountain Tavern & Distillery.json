{"text":"Clean, attractive and comfortable place, good food, good service, $2 beer selection.  It's a 'yes' for me!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for Happy Hour last Thursday.  As you'd hope with a new restaurant, it was pretty busy.  We sat at the bar and looked through the menu.  For a Tavern, I was a little surprised at the minimal beer choices.  I ordered an IPA and my wife tried a light beer.  We talked a bit with the bartender and found out that the distillery part was true.  They are making moonshine now and gearing up to age some whiskey as well as rum and vodka.  We tried a couple appetizers - pretzels and beer cheese plus their chicken wings.  Both were okay but certainly nothing special.  The menu indicated a pound of wings but I doubt there were that many.  We're happy to have another place for drinks and food in the neighborhood, but right now there's nothing too special that would draw us here too often."}
{"text":"BMTD is a great addition to the neighborhood! Great food and great service. You can't go wrong with the fish & chips! Love the bar and love the atmosphere! Family friendly. Keep it up guys, great work and Thank you for opening here TR!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. Wish it was a larger restaurant because there's always going to be a wait time. Bad area for waiting inside. But the food was great, the cooking staff is looking to set the bar high for all the first timers coming in to try the restaurant. The beer battered fish tacos were extremely good, the rice that came with then was not anything too amazing. We also enjoyed the beer cheese and pretzel appetizer since it was 2$off during their happy hour. The wait staff seemed a little inexperienced but that's expected with a new restaurant. Unfortunately we didn't try any deserts but they all sounded amazing! Opt in for the sweet potato  fries for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is great, good food and good selection of draft beers. The honey BBQ sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. Just what we needed around here!  Great ambiance, can relate to the crowd"}
{"text":"Everyone beware of price of tequila at this place 14.00 per shot !!! We had 2 burgers 2 beers and 2 shots and it was a 70.00 tab !!! OMG will not be back !! We have been going there for almost a year and NEVER paid 14.00 for ONE SHOT EVER !!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch. What a great deal. Happy hour prices and really good food. The fries are the best I've had in a long time. The only thing keeping me from over indulging was my wife stealing from my plate. Cory, the bartender, provided great service."}
{"text":"as a sports bar we'd give it 4 stars. but we went for food, and it was just ok pub food. the interior is so nice we were expecting the food match. you'd also guess the food is better based on how the menu reads. too bad. we'll give it 6mo and go back again and see if they decided to upgrade their food to match the rest of the place."}
{"text":"We ate here last week and had an enjoyable experience. The food was good, the service was ok, we chalked it up to working out the new restaurant jitters. We went back tonight, we had Joseph as our server, and it seems like this might be his first restaurant job. Service was slow and uncomfortable. The food was just ok and very slow to come out of the kitchen. We were a party of 5, and had 2 friends stop and have a drink ( they did not eat) , when we got our bill, we were shocked to see 18% gratuity added on. Joseph never told us he added the tip on, there was nothing on the menu that states a gratuity will be added on for parties of 5. I'm glad we checked the bill, the service didn't warrant 18% gratuity and I would have been really mad if it had cost us 36%. Check your bills."}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely terrible. Like what the heck. I went here with my family hoping for a nice American food dish but little did we know how bad it was gonna be. Our waiter acted as if he was on drugs; making stupid remarks about what we ordered, asking his friends stupid questions while we ordered , and twirling around like a princess. Who in the world does that? We ordered our food finally, (which ranged from $10-$25) and it came out the size of a quarter. I am very disappointed that they put this restaurant in our little town of cave creek. Good luck to this restaurant and good luck to the people who eat there."}
{"text":"This place is going to be great!  They just opened and my wife and I went for lunch.  The Waldorf Salad is excellent; fresh mixed greens, lots of grapes and just the right amount of vinaigrette dressing.  We also split the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious.  They will be opening the distillery soon which will serve bourbons, whisky, and even vodka.  They have about 7 televisions and a big bar which will make for a great neighborhood hangout.  We met Steve, one of the owners and he has some great plans for our new local establishment."}
{"text":"Happy hour $2 off apps. Had poutine (fries with gravy and cheese curds) and meat & cheese board. Both were delish and service was great. Will be new go to for us."}
{"text":"Just what the neighborhood needed. A family friendly place to grab a great bite to eat and watch a game. Food was great. Beer was cold which is an absolute must....and the staff was really friendly. We for sure be back."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for helping us find this little gem.  Can't wait for their bourbon and whiskey!  Great food, friendly staff, cool spot.  The all summer happy hour doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"It was great. Especially with the complexes history. Service was good. The food, was exceptional. The cucumber Collins was a amazing mixed drink. The manager, possibly owner was so personable. And didn't mind switching out my brothers meal because he is TOO picky! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Would give this place a 5 but drinks are so overpriced. I beg the owners to look at this. $13 for a small drink is ridiculous. It won't stop me from going though. It's the only place in walking distance that you can get GREAT food and really nice service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing service and great atmosphere. This restuant/distillery is top notch. I had fish and chips, wife had hummus platter. The fish and chips were very good and wife loved her hummus. The hummus was made in house, we have never had hummus that good. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great place right here in town. Heck I'd travel for service and food like this.  Awesome service from Corey again. Service was above and beyond but not over the top or annoying.   I would call the Green Chile Pork Adovada a signature dish. Over easy egg sets it off! Always seem to be looking for ways to improve the customer experience. Great atmosphere even you are not a local."}
{"text":"Excellent food/drinks/service. Have been in a couple of times and have fully enjoyed our experience! Fish and chips and Mac and cheese are a must! So happy to have a great restaurant within walking distance!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! The atmosphere was great. Loved the decor! It felt like a friendly, neighboorhood restaurant. Our two kids liked the food. The staff was nice. The food was great, and we absolutely loved the drinks! Bartender was great! We will definately eat here at least once a month with our family. So glad to have a restaurant in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food and great service. We stopped in for the grand opening and the place was alive. It's an excellent atmosphere with live music. Very happy and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for drinks. This review is not based on any other food as I did not order. My largest complaint is that this place is a distillery,they make very good vodka however they do not feature any specialty cocktails made with their own vodka.  they had one vodka drink listed on the menu that was buried within other drinks. You would think since they are distillery that they would have a menu of specialty cocktails highlighting the in-house crafted vodka.  Staff was friendly but we had to ask different people at different times for suggestions on drinks. Everyone just told  is \"we will make any drink you want just substitute our vodka.\"  That is fine, but I was really looking for specialty cocktails that they would recommend."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were great. Came out smaller than normal, they noticed this and fried up more fish for me at no cost. Great food,solid atmosphere and super friendly & attentive staff. Can't wait to try their whiskey(still aging). Pretzels and kilt lifter cheese are some of the best in town."}
{"text":"I came in with my family and our servers name was Desire. Desire made the experience very enjoyable and did whatever she needed to do to make us happy. This place has a nice atmosphere, amazing menu, and nice staff. This restaurant is definitely a great addition to Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"This place has been consistently    good over time. We like the apps. Pot stickers and egg rolls   Flatbread is yummy as well"}
{"text":"Service is a five!  Food a two(ish)... drinks were amazing... so I'll meet in the middle with a 3... sorry guys... upon recommendation we ordered the Mahi tacos... we were told that they were fresh battered and fried to order... with 'batter made fresh every day'... well, AWESOME we'll take those and the 'New' item on the menu... the vodka 'something-or-other'...ummm the pasta ... 'under-whelming', as my husband put it... and the tacos were off... not in a bad fish kind of way... a 'fried-cut-refried-to-heat' kind of off...   First time here I thought SLAM DUNK... FINALLY a place to take the fam in the 'hood... 2nd time... ahhh it's good still, but not like the first... 3rd time, WTF IS HAPPENING HERE???   no 4th time... I'm so sorry... I wish it could've work... I love our neighborhood... I sincerely wish you good luck... and a little advice.  Whatever you changed FIX IT!!! and call us back... we will try it again... ONLY IF YOU FIX IT..."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this restaurant a few times now.  When I sit in the restaurant the service is good and the food has been good.  However, I've walked out of this place 3 times now when I sit at the bar because no one acknowledges me.  The first time I sat for 10 minutes and just left.  It was busy, but not that busy.  It seems to me they need an extra bar tender from time to time and could probably increase the skill set of the current bartenders to be more efficient.  I'm not trying to be mean, but watch Bar Rescue and take some lessons.  I hope they are successful as we need a place like this up here.  I'm a local and would love to make this my go to restaurant and watering hole."}
{"text":"Cute little place with good food and great service! We love trying new places and are glad to have stumbled upon this place.   From the second we walked in, everyone was so friendly.  We ordered wings as an app and they were better than most places we've ever had!! Better than zipps and that's hard to beat!  I ordered the club and my fiancé ordered one of the chicken sandwiches. Everything was so delicious. We will be back! And also want to try the brunch soon!"}
{"text":"First, please install purse hooks under the lovely bar. Second, check the prices; bar food is slightly too high! One can go to upscale Postino Wine Bar in Kierland & have panini & ciabatta for $10. Nearby Brisam's has gr8 burgers for $10. Few of us need an 8 oz burger. Staff is friendly & professional. We want you to make it, but you need some (healthy) adjustments (broccoli?)."}
{"text":"We live down the street. So decided to try this place out. When on a Saturday night it was really packed what about half an hour for a table but the wait time was tapered by a trip to the bar. Tried their only distilled Spirit they make. Their house made vodka. It was okay but since we're doing shots at a buddies house with grey goose and premium domestic vodka this one was kind of harsh. But they had a good selection of beer. Or dinner or group had the Mahi tacos the pork adovada beer burgers and chili mac and cheese. The food was pretty good much better than expected from small neighborhood bar. The wait staff was attentive and laughed at my not so funny jokes. Overall a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Think we went on day 2 of their \"soft opening\". Overall, we're excited about this place. To expect perfection this early is unrealistic. You must be patient as they're still working out the kinks. However staff is nice and owner was eager for feedback. This place has potential. Nice option to have close to home. Had Blackened BBQ Cheeseburger (shared with husband) and was good but very flat and not what would have expected. Prices make it a nice everyday option."}
{"text":"So glad to have this place in the neighborhood now! Very enjoyable experience every time I've stopped in. Steve, one of the owners, is great - personable, accommodating, and open to any/all suggestions or recommendations. And Misty, a bartender, is one cool gal!"}
{"text":"Good food and can't wait for the distillery process to be complete but too bad I'm not very patient. The atmosphere is nice but it's still hard to draw me away from Brisams since their food is consistently good. I'll be back to try it again at some point"}
{"text":"We were very excited to see this place was finally open, being one of the only places in this part of town. We just stopped by for drinks so I can't weigh in on the food. The atmosphere is great and the service was excellent. The drink menu looked promising and unique but fell a little short in execution. I got the Trouble Maker and it had a great flavor but was VERY tart. I personally like really tart but it was even too much for me. I think it was from the strawberries which weren't very sweet plus it had a lot of lime juice in it. It could have benefitted from a little simple syrup. It was also hard to drink with such a little straw since there were pieces of muddled strawberries...would have been easier with a wide straw. My boyfriend got the whisky and prickly pear drink (don't remember the name). It was also very tart but better balanced than the Trouble Maker. Since it was their soft opening, we definitely didn't expect perfection and we'll be back to see what kind of changes are made!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My family and I love to eat in or order out. Very clean. The staff is courteous. My husband practically lives there.  We love this place! The beer cheese burger is phenomenal. Yum!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled the Distillery finally opened. Staff is top shelf, ambiance is nice and unique. Ownership shows they care and the food quality is a pleasant surprise. Keep up the good work and thank you for providing us another option in the Creek."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my time here. Very creative mixed drink. They are going to make their own moonshine and other liquor. I haven't tried the food yet but looking at plates and reviewing the menu I found lots of interesting foods that I can't wait to try. This is not a typical bar so don't expect typical bar food like one of the person who commented seems to have wanted. It's a distillery so they are naturally going to be more concern about the food and offer a higher quality, more creative meal.   One of the owner was very friendly and came to us to ask how everything was and to offer feedback.  I hope they succeed."}
{"text":"How nice it would be to have deep pockets and to not worry about making money in your business. I have been in the restaurant business for 30 years. There is so much wrong with this place. When was the last time you ordered a $14 salad and it came on iceberg lettuce? How about the bartender that can't re-fill an iced tea, even after you asked. Or same bartender bad- mouthing the AZ. sport team. He was more concerned with his opinion and \"cool\" look, than servicing the customer. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Once is enough. Service was fine but food was poor at best. I had fish & chips. If not the worst I have ever had it was close. The batter was not fully cooked through and tasted very \"doughy\". It was like the oil they fried the battered fish in wasn't nearly hot enough. Thank goodness the beer was good so I could wash the bad taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Same heavy food as The Creek. Sauces and breading on everything. Overpriced drinks. So disappointed all the neighborhood places open with the same overpriced and unhealthy food."}
{"text":"I really want this place to succeed, which is why I'm writing this. It's going to be long ...  My husband and I found Black Mountain last year and decided to check it out. They had several craft beers to choose from and a pretty good-looking menu. We were excited to have found such a great place so close to home, however, after going back several times and trying different menu items we quickly came to the realization that they would just have to be a place to go for a quick beer and bread pudding (easily the best we've ever had!) Here are just a few examples of what we've been disappointed with ...  -The burgers are usually good but not consistently good -Penne a'la Vodka had to be sent back, completely tasteless -Green Chili Mac & Cheese is dry & overly spicy -Mixed drinks are just okay -We went for taco Tuesday and only liked the fish tacos  The service is usually good except for the last time we were there, which was Sunday, 5/20/18. We stopped in Saturday afternoon (the 19th) on our way to baseball game, sat at the bar because we had limited time, ordered two beers and the beer cheese burger to share. The bartender was new so she was a little slow and could definitely use more training, like \"if a customer tells you that they're in a hurry, make sure you take their food order to the kitchen before you go off to find someone to change a beer tap, even if it's for their beer.\" She was very nice though, we weren't delayed too long, and the burger was really good this time, so it was all good. While sitting at the bar we started chatting with the guy sitting next to us, who turned out to be one of the bartenders.  He was also very nice and mentioned that they would be open tomorrow at 10:30 am, for Sunday brunch. He showed us a menu and raved about the bloody marys. We were sold. We even invited one of my step-daughters to come to brunch with us.    The next day we arrived at 10:45 am, the door was open, and we could hear talking in the back, but there was no one in sight. We said \"Hello\", sat in one of the booths and a few minutes later a waiter came out and let us know that they would not be open until 11 am. We apologized for the confusion and asked if it would be okay if we waited inside and maybe looked at a menu. He said that was fine and brought us 3 regular menus and water. He asked if he could get us something to drink and we ordered three bloody marys and asked for the brunch menu. While he was off looking for bloody mary mix the chef came out and chastised us for being there early and proceeded to tell us that nothing is available until 11 am, not even drinks. Again, we apologized for the confusion and asked if it was okay if we waited inside. She said fine and went back in the kitchen. Then the waiter came back with 1 brunch menu, for the three of us to share I guess, and informed us that they were out of bloody mary mix. What??? We then ordered 3 mimosas just to find out that they didn't have champagne. He was noticeably embarrassed, and we can tell he felt bad, but at that point we really didn't see a reason to stay. We were looking forward to a good brunch and didn't want to be disappointed further, especially since the \"chef\" was so rude.   We really tried to like this place, but they need a lot of help.  Also, we heard they were trying to be a sports bar ... yuck! Don't we have enough of those?"}
{"text":"Ya know...I really like this place. The food is tasty and the bartenders are great. The owner walks around and makes things are good by touching base with each table. My dad owns a restaurant and that's the kind of thing an owner should be doing. Vodka (the owner just brought me a free sample shot) - amazing. Food - pretty darn good. They pour their Guinness right. Lots of tv's and good vibes only. Riding my bike home from this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible wine prices for what they serve. Food had been a hit and miss. Haven't gone back since last year. The service was spotty at best. Hope it has improved for who goes there."}
{"text":"Good service, Very good food, The best French Fries ! They also have a nice selection of Beers and a lot of Big Screens with Sports on. Overall an excellent choice in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The food is fine if you ever get it. We came here twice. The first time we waited forever for service, food and follow up  we waited so long the waiter paid for us a drink! Tonight we decided to try it again and the bar tender who was a male didn't greet us for 10 minutes then when he did he asks what we want to drink and flings the napkin and hits me in the face! My husband asks to see a drink list and he ignores him and then I did and he told me just to look at the taps or look at the wall. I was so shocked and we actually just got up and left. We are so disappointed"}
{"text":"Very nice place, comfortable atmosphere and good food.  I had the beer battered fish tacos.  Absolutely fantastic.  Lisa was very attentive and helpful.  I will definitely be back.  Can't wait for them to get permission to sell their distilled whiskey.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have been hear at least 5 times and truly enjoy it! Everything we've tried from the menu has been delicious and the service is always great! So nice to have a great spot to eat so close to home."}
{"text":"I would have liked to rate the food here, but they wouldn't serve us any!  My daughter and I walked in to a packed restaurant at 9:20 pm on a Friday night.  There were only two booths available.  Actually one booth since the two guys who walked in behind us took the other one.  There were two high tops open, but other than that, it was packed!  We sat down and the host informed us that they closed down the kitchen early because of the \"abysmal crowd\" and they were only serving appetizers.  Mr daughter and I looked at him like, \"what\"?  I said \"this is an abysmal crowd, are you kidding me\"?  Then he said they normally don't close this early, but they wanted to save money.  I was in shock, but we were starving.  So we looked at the menu.  We could choose from hummus or a cheese plate and some other \"abysmal\" choices (LOL)!  So we left!  Good luck guys!  Most restaurants fail in the first year, even WHEN they serve food! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"A Tatum Ranch gem! This place is so good...yet so few know about it. Great drinks, great food, chill atmosphere--just hope they can get enough business to stay in business. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome food! Flatbread pizzas, spinach salad, pretzels with beer cheese and fish tacos are the BEST!!"}
{"text":"Great spot and addition to this area of Cave Creek! The interior is very nicely done, with an ample bar and eating area. The only think missing is outdoor seating. The menu has a lot of choices, with a few vegetarian items. Prices are pretty good, with most options in the $10-15 range. I had the green chili mac & cheese, which I really enjoyed. It had a nice spicy kick to it at the end of each bite, and the portion was large enough to take a snack size amount home. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent summer happy hour. Food was good, service was a little on the slow side, so that could be improved. The burgers were great"}
{"text":"Tenth time eating here and tonight we were very unhappy!!!!! When we arrived there was hardly anyone there and then after we ordered lots of customers came in. My husband got his dinner 20 minutes before my daughter and I got our dinner. There seemed to be confusion in the kitchen. I finally just asked for ours to go. They finally brought it out with an apology and our full bill!!! They should have given us a little break on our $70 bill! We won't be back on a Friday again!  We got our dinner home and the big dinner size Buffalo Chicken salad was the size of a small side salad. So dissatisfied! I called and spoke with the manager and she apologized and said that they were really busy and to come back tomorrow afternoon and she would make it right."}
{"text":"Overall good. Cocktails are definitely over priced. Due to that I could definitely see the restaurant not making it long in the area it chose."}
{"text":"After a super long Friday, between work, practices and late rehearsals, my family and I were looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat that wasn't fast food which is hard to find when it's past 9pm in Cave Creek. We looked on yelp and saw that Black Mountain was open till 12, so we were so excited to have a nice meal. We walked in a little before 9:30pm and right as we walked in a super nice server greeted us and told us to go ahead and grab any booth. So we did, he came over and let us know that they had just switched over to their \"Late Night\" menu which was very disappointing. I was honestly quite shocked that they had switched over so early. When I asked what time they closed since it seemed odd to switch menus so early. He said they didn't really have an official close time, it just depends on how busy they are, if they stay open. So I definitely recommend calling if you're headed there in the evening.   Since we were all starving and exhausted we decided to go ahead and take a look at that menu. There's probably a total of 12 items on the \"late night\" menu, all fried and bar food. Definitely not what we had in mind. My daughter and I shared the Gravy fries, my other daughter had the potstickers and my husband had the wings. Everything was mediocre.   I do have to say though the service was great. Our server was extremely kind, friendly and genuine. He checked on us multiple times and told us we should definitely come back to try their full menu."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I'd actually forgotten about it until it popped up in my Yelp feed. I had the po boy shrimp sandwich when I went in and it was again ok. I regretted letting the waiter talk me out of the mahi mahi. My two companions also weren't excited about their food. It's a little overpriced for the portions as well, but that's typical in our area. Service was very slow too, and I'm pretty sure our waiter was new to the profession, we had to ask for everything (ketchup, silverware, refills). I think I'd stick to just drinks here and maybe appetizers. Cool look."}
{"text":"Says they're open until 10pm online- pulled up at 9:15 and people were still eating, we were told everything was closed. Please adjust your online hours so that customers don't drive all the way there only to find that you're closed early."}
{"text":"I read some of the other reviews and was hesitant to come. However after having lunch here with my wife,  I have to give it a four star review.  The food was absolutely delicious. I had the flat bread and a salad for seven dollars which was a afternoon special.  My wife had the Fish and chips. Their french fries are absolutely scrumptious.  The service was outstanding with a young man named Eric.  I'm looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"It gets three because Eric tried so hard. He clearly hasn't had training, but being an old F&B guy, I like effort. My steak came out rare, not medium. Eric brought it back. My wife ordered Waldorf salad which came out nothing  as described. When we pointed this out, Eric went to the kitchen and was told \" salads change when we run out of stuff\". Our Waldorf was iceberg lettuce, no grapes, blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola. Menus said mixed greens. Hostess body language was saying I wish I was anywhere but here. Drink service as lacking. Check was delivered with no effort to sell desert. Owners, that's your money not hitting your registers. Third time in where the food was just lacking. I will say my mashed potatoes were great. Any competition rolls in, you're gone. Hire a chef. Great decor."}
{"text":"This place took a dive fast. Service is horrible unless you like your server never being around! I asked for a glass of Glen Morangie scotch and instead I'm brought some watered down off brand stuff like I wouldn't notice and charged for Glen Morangie. Wife ordered a wine and was brought champagne and then charged for the champagne - and instead of being credited back, I was given cash back? Ordered a burger and it came with no condiments, I paid $1.50 for avocado and was brought 1/4 of an avocado 10 minutes after getting my burger. We were in there an hour and 20 minutes and saw our server three times. I also saw people at the bar ordering more beer and bartenders/managers reusing old glasses instead of bringing a new glass. We liked coming here because it was local - but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very impressed.... And satisfied.  I had the Mahi Tacos and a Sparkling Wine.  Steve had a beer cheese burger  Food was amazing .  Service was great .  Michele was our waitress  Very friendly and helpful.  We came on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly quiet.  Good music but not too loud.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Check Please. Looked good on the show, but my experience was sub par at best. Went on a Sunday night, early. Place was empty when we first got in, then started to fill up around 6 pm.    The most disappointing part of the experience was very poor service. A young guy appeared to be the only server, bartender, whatever of any kind. As more people came in, this guy turned manic literally running around constantly and providing poor service whenever you could flag him down.  He was moving so fast that every time he rushed past our table it created a rush of air (wind) that was fairly annoying.   However he virtually ignored my friend and I for some time as tables filled up, and rushed us so much when I ordered I felt I couldn't ask the questions I needed to make the right choice.  I felt if I asked for the minute or two of his time it would have been a problem for him.    I did feel a bit sorry for him as they seemed short staffed, but he could have made it better if at any time he apologized and said something about it or if he at least gave us a tad bit of attention when we flagged him over to our table. Instead he had this irritated look on his face, acted in such a rushed manner or when I asked him for something he practically tossed it at the table as he rushed by to go somewhere else.   My Sonoran chicken was a disappointment - a $15.00 one. On the Tv show, it showed it with fluffy rice and a nice side of vegetables. Flash to the  real experience - no veggies, just a plate of chicken and rice so wet it was like soup.  A serious rip off for that much money. A side of veggies or some salad would have made it a better value and not sure if the rice was done improperly or this is the standard way it comes.  I feel like the 'beauty shot' from the Tv show is just super misleading if the real food is nothing like it.  My friend had the fish and chips which I tasted. The fries were very good. The fish was just ok, a bit dry. The appetizer was the humus which was fine overall. Veggies were a bit poor quality but the pita bread was great.  Overall this was a bad 1st impression for me. Since this restaurant is quite a bit out of the way, with poor service, sub par food and high prices for what you get - I will not go back.  I read some other reviews that have some overlay to my experience. I wonder if the owner of this place cares enough to read the reviews or respond to customers. I would have talked to a manager tonight, but not one person in sight for 2 hours but our server."}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to eat lunch on Sunday. Found Black Mountain Tavern. I got there just after 1:00 PM. Place was not busy at all, only 4 customers at the time. Sat at the bar and ordered a beer and looked at the menu. Good selection from the appetizers to the entrees. I decided on the Green Chile Pork Adodava. Pork was very tender and was very tasty. Food came out very quickly and the service was very good. Stop by if you're out that way and check 'em out."}
{"text":"Had dinner here 3x in the past five weeks with my family (4 ppl total) - wait time, service, drinks and food have been great each time!"}
{"text":"I have yet to try anything here that I don't like. Excellent food, cocktails, beer selection, and service!"}
{"text":"Hands down Best bloody mary's around, idk if it's their personal vodka or the extra cilantro but whateverrr ... my FAV!  & the Waldorf salad is GREAT!  The staff is always so nice & attentive, even the owner is there & dbchecks with each table to ensure everything is on point!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here was about 2 weeks ago and the food & service was very good. Sunday night was a whole different story. It wasn't very busy & the bartender seemed friendly enough telling us to sit anywhere. The waiter couldn't have cared less. We asked about different beers & pricing (since the prices aren't on the menu). He was clearly annoyed and just walked away! After waiting a few minutes, my husband went to the bar to see if another waiter was available but she was busy. We ended up walking out & went to another restaurant. This was so disappointing as we hoped to work this restaurant into our regulars."}
{"text":"Ok...so I was super excited that a new restaurant was around the corner. We went after it opened initially and you could tell that they still needed to refine the operations and customer service. We went again today and well...I have to say we will not be back to eat again...we may have drinks...but not a place for a meal...maybe apps??  The menu needs more options and the cook needs to get more creative.    So why am I so negative? Well, we ordered a kids chicken fingers and they came out super quick, the were super dark, as I cut them into pieces it was clear they were not cooked through, totally pink/raw.  Most kids would have picked it up, dunked in ketchup and no one would have known they just ate raw chicken.  The server was apologetic and we got a pizza instead.  You would expect the manager to come over and apologize, nope...no one on the staff was over 25...maybe there was no manager?  Our food was ok...  Maybe they can add some food safety protocols and more options..."}
{"text":"The service here is hit or miss. We've been a few times now and have a different experience each time. I love the pretzel bites, the kale salad is pretty good and the gnocchi is real good as well, and it is a huge serving. My parents and husband likes their burgers. We have also tried their flatbread pizzas which are pretty good but not so filling."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. BBQ Garden burger was really good for vegetarians. They char it which adds some wonderful flavor. Fries were big, seasoned well, and crispy. Avoid the pasta - bland. Only knock is three of their drafts (all IPAs) were cashed."}
{"text":"Really good food, excellent service and ambiance. Really no complaints aside from the food being a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars and they really came close. I just want them to add some creativity to the menu and not be the same as every other place in Cave Creek. What we did order was good and the service was great. I was hoping for just a little more umph!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but certainly not great. Food is decent to good, but fairly expensive for what you are getting. The burgers are huge, which helps, I guess. Unfortunately, leftover burgers are gross, so it doesn't really matter how big they are. I went alone, and spent $40 not including tip, on a burger,  2 beers, and a whiskey. I may give it another try,  but not any time soon."}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I. American here for Sunday dinner. We arrived at about 5pm. The place was not busy which is why we came early.   This place is only about 15 minutes from us and we are always looking for a local place to go for good casual food.  This place was just highlighted on check please.   We started with the pretzel and beer cheese. Awesome. Soft pretzel be read with a generous portion of beer cheese.   My lovely wife ordered a cheese burger - medium cooked. It came out way over cooked like well.done. It had a decent beef flavor. Big l1/2 pound size. My wife said it was not.good.  We also had a small portion of the green chili Mac and Cheese. We so wanted this to be good. It was not. Almost no cheese sauce. Lots of heat from the green chilli but very little flavor other then the pasta. Watery. Very disappointed.   I had the pork adovodo. Very favorable. Delicious. Perfectly cooked intense pork flavored dish.   We don't drink alcohol, but the offers seemed extensive  and of particular note is their in house made vodka which is distilled 10 times. It is susposed to just disappear in drinks I was told.   Service was 5/5. Food was 2/5. We probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to many restaurants in the cave creek area and this restaurant is number one on my favorites! I always try to get something new every time I'm there and so far I have yet to even come close to disliking a meal. I've never been a fan of fish and chips until I had a bite from my friends plate and now it's my go to meal. My ideal meal is a BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and the best one I've ever had is from here. Their menu has a lot to choose from but is not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, they have decided not to serve the regular menu from 11-1 on Sundays and are only serving their brunch menu.  Went to The Creek instead since they offer both and it was good."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant and bar. Family friendly, good food, and a nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"First time here. Wanted to give them time to work out kinks. Overall was impressed. The place is small. Almost too small when servers are constantly bumping into each other. Great amount of TVs.  The menu is pretty eclectic. We had the medium wings. Flavor was fine but wings almost too big with too much skin. The fish tacos were tasty but the southwest rice tasted a little old. The service was pretty good. The prices seem a little high though and that's the reason I gave it 3 stars, not 4.  We've had similar meals elsewhere for less. We'll come back."}
{"text":"Second time here - we came last night.  I had the Mahi tacos - only a couple of statements! 1-AMAZING and 2-best Mahi tacos I've had - a definite must!  Wings are full of meat and great tasting.  Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this great little restaurant.  We've enjoyed our meals on both occasions.  No exaggeration, the fish and chips were some of the best I've had anywhere.  Service was prompt and friendly. The atmosphere is great and music not too loud for caring on a conversation.  Prices are reasonable.  We'll definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"Went here this past Monday,  2/12/18 for lunch. Our server was very pleasant. My group of four ordered four lunches, three were very tasty and the fourth was outright poor. The poor one was, a burger that was ordered as medium rare and came out medium well. No excuse as there was only one other in restaurant at time we were there. We ordered four drinks, two wines and two beers. The initial glass of red wine had passed its time, already turning. The two beers were tasty, but were they worth $14 a glass,  NO! The server never indicated the price of the beers and it was published nowhere. Very poor customer service. Won't be rushing back, nor recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice local eatery. Good mix of bar seating and family Dining. Staff competent and mildly Pleasant. Good for locals and very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was very good, but the food not so much. I got fish tacos. They didn't come with a lot of sals and were very bland. I will definitely try this place again but will get something different. The ambiance is great and I love to see new business here!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere great food waiter very attentive but not overly attentive.  We ordered the wings to start and they are awesome!!"}
{"text":"We had the pretzels with cheese sauce (YUM!) and shared the mac and cheese and Mahi mahi tacos. The food was fresh and delicious, and our server Aubrey was great. We are fans and plan to add this to our local restaurant rotation. Go, check it out!"}
{"text":"We showed up during big the soft opening to a huge crowd & had a great night! The food was prompt, wait staff friendly, and everything was delicious! I had the fish tacos, which were plentiful. We had the pretzels & beer cheese dip for appetizers& they were fantastic! My wife had the fish & chips & the fries were well seasoned, the fish light & not greasy at all. The owner stopped by a couple of times to checkin, which was great! Definitely a do-over! Glad there's a restaurant near by again!"}
{"text":"We've been going to BMT pretty regularly and are usually very happy, but not so much this past Sunday.  Since no one bothered to ask us how our experience was, I thought I would post and maybe someone who cares would see it.  First of all, I do want to mention the hostess.  When we entered, she was slumped in a perfect attitude of 20-something boredom.  Then we got seated near the hostess station and DH said---my back was to her---that she was just staring at our table, but he said it was a somewhat blank stare, so he thinks she was just out of it or stoned.  Then, near the end of our meal, the busboy joined her and they both stood at this rail near the door and again---close enough to our table it was uncomfortable.  When we left the table, we hadn't even taken three steps and they descended like locusts to clean up.  I would suggest management needs to find both kids something to do when not occupied with serving guests.  However, our server was awesome, except that he never asked us how our food was.  I have a feeling he knew what I was going to say, so he didn't ask.  But he was on top of everything and did a great job.  We shared a house salad with blue cheese and it was very good.  Fresh, not imaginative, but nice and fresh.  Then DH ordered the Blackened BBQ hamburger and regular fries.  I ordered fish and chips with sweet potato fries.   DH raved about his burger and fries and I tasted them and they WERE good.  The fries were so hot when first delivered they almost burnt the roof of my mouth!  My food was cold.  Seriously.  Do you know how disgusting cold fish and chips and limp sweet potato fries are? And I couldn't ask for them to be warmed up because you know what a microwave does to fried food.  And a re-fire and DH would have been eating cold food, cause he would have delayed eating his meal so we could eat together.  So I just wanted BMT to know---cold food Sunday night, guys, not a good thing."}
{"text":"Went during soft opening week..limited menu, limited beers--was told new menus were coming. Prices fairly high, quality OK but not outstanding. Went back after official opening, and yes there were new menus (attractive printing but that's about it), however no new items on the menu to speak of. Way too many items with fish/seafood. Where are items such as Reubens, taco salads, taco platers, pizzas, BLT's, missing normal foods most expect?  Here's the bad management part..during the soft opening the manager was fixated on fixing glassware and straightening items behind the bar..not once did anyone ask for feedback. No feedback from customers with action taken will translate into yet another failed bar/restaurant in this area.  Management..ask your patrons what they want, get their feedback before it is too late!"}
{"text":"Great service, outstanding drinks, and very good food! Try the pretzel' appitizer......yum. beer burger was really good!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late night snack last night and was pretty happy with my experience! The atmosphere was nice, I liked the wooden walls and the neat bar area. We got to sit wherever and had really good service. Like the quickest service we have ever had. We were in and out of there in 25 minutes, it was incredible ha! We ordered pretzels with beer cheese and also a hummus plate. Both were delicious. Also both were $2 cheaper than listed on the menu which was a nice surprise, idk if they do reverse happy hour or something? The food was delicious except the carrots served with our hummus were nasty, all dried up and white. Hummus was not my fave but I did like it. The pretzels and beer cheese were delightful, the cheese had just a bit of spice, perfect! Good amount of food for $15, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood spot. We started with the Crispy pork potstickers and they hit the spot! The fries are excellent. I ordered the fish tacos and they were great..they came with rice and the rice was old and dry and cold and crunchy. The tacos rocked so I was happy with that!   One of my sons had chili mac and cheese and he ate it all and said it was good. My other son had flat bread and liked it. My husband had a cheese burger and was pleased.  All and all it's a good place to grab food in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Overpriced with simple and unimpressive menu.  Went once and spent a small fortune for lackluster food.  Not the worst ever but won't go again.  Plus the place is not kid friendly."}
{"text":"Great food! Get the mahi tacos and green chile Mac and cheese! We will be back. Chaise was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very limited menu and food had odd under-taste..did not sit well with me about 2 hours later. Mom ordered a glass of wine..she's normally a real light weight..she said wine was rather blah so figured it was just an oddity so ordered another glass and had the same watered down taste. She had no effect after 2 glasses of wine..normally she feels tipsy after 1 glass..I suspect the drink was watered down. High bill, poor food, felt lousy a couple of hours later..won't be back!"}
{"text":"We just moved in down the road and every time we have been here the food and service has been excellent! I got tacos that were to die for and the pretzels with beer cheese are some of the best I've ever had! The happy hour is also very affordable and goes till 7 which is nice! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"What a great and very popular bar and restaurant. Hands on management, makes this place run like clockwork. Very good food, well prepared. Not a huge menu, but enough to make decisions difficult as everything is SO good. Beer cheese dip with soft pretzel. YUMMY. Excellent burgers with several choices. Great mushroom pasta in Alfredo sauce. Best fries in town! More that I haven't tasted yet! So looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening around 5:30, not many customers at that time but service was pretty slow.  We started with jumbo wings in mild sauce with blue cheese. Husband likes the flavor!  I had the prosciutto and arugula flatbread, which was delicious! It's an appetizer size or good for a small dinner. I also had a side order of the green chili Mac and cheese. I loved the flavor of the cheese and noodles, but way too much spice - and I love spicy food. So hot you can't enjoy It. Side size was perfect.  Husband got the chicken breasts over cilantro rice with a side of mashed potatoes - huge portion and delicious!! Chicken was juicy and all had great flavor.  For dessert, husband got the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. It was a huge cookie cooked in a skillet - so gooey and amazing!!! I should have gotten that. Instead I got the caramel apple crumble with ice cream. Apples tasted dehydrated and not much crumble, was lukewarm when It came out even though It took almost 15 minutes to arrive. Definitely would share the chocolate chip cookie dessert next time.  Overall, good food. Slower service. We would probably go back again."}
{"text":"I have been a few times now with groups of people since they opened tried a number of dishes. The only thing that has really kept me going back is the proximity.  Some of the appetizers are very good but only a few dishes like the fish and chips are actually worth the price. Wings were pretty good and the pretzels and cheese dip are very good.  Burgers: okay, nothing wrong with them but nothing special. Won't have one again since I can drive 10 minutes further to get one much better for the same or less cost.  Green Chili Mac & Cheese: had last night and people mostly say good things so maybe I got a bad serving. Had a nice bite but not a single piece of green chili. Also not much cheese. I won't get it again.  Fish and chips and fish tacos are the only dishes I would recommend. However, I am not a fan of their fries as it seems like they have gone from good to blah since they opened.   I have also tried a number of their cocktails and all have been good but not quite good enough to draw me there just for the cocktails. Again nothing really special, new, or uniquely creative. Some people have complained about the high price here but that's the going rate for cocktails like this, it's not the price that is off.  Basically every time I have eaten there or had a cocktail my thought has been \"it was okay, I wish I had paid $1-3 less for everything but that's the price I pay for being lazy tonight and not wanting to drive further\".  At the beginning of the summer they said they would have some house made liquor at the end of the summer and things like whiskey or bourbon wouldn't come for a couple years. I truly hope they make it that far and the distilling is executed a little better than the food especially since I can walk home."}
{"text":"This was terrible. They charged us $5 for a side of feta cheese. It was $13 for a burger. Will not be coming back.Our server Joe was stoned. It was $120 for my family of four to eat here. We each got an entree and one drink."}
{"text":"Did they get a new cook? Ordered the shrimp yakitorii (nothing Japanese in the flavor here) First the shrimp was good. But the small side salad had literally 1/4 cup of dressing-drowning !  And the veggie medley was mush and bland. :("}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant!! Great food and even better drinks. I had the pork sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!! They make their own vodka which is incredible !!! Going there tonight and I can't wait :)"}
{"text":"What a unique find! Everything here in Cave Creek closes by Nine PM so we were happy to find such a welcoming spot on a Sunday evening.  Closing winter Olympic ceremony on the Tele\"s and some great Bourbons, whiskey and in house distilled vodkas found here tonight.  Ms. Lisa was an excellent bartender and introduced us to Hanger 1's Rosé Vodka on the rocks. A perfect ending to our evening.  We also devoured prosciutto and arugula flat bread ... highly recommended!  Between the late night hours ( 10pm closing), warm service and delicious food I happily give Black Mountain Tavern & Distillery a 5 star \" late night sip n chat \" review!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We went on a Friday evening with a decent crowd. The decor was nice and had a good layout. We maybe waited a couple of minutes and were seated. Good, friendly waiter and staff. I got a cheese burger with a fried egg and my wife got chicken. The food came quickly and both dishes were fantastic. It seemed the quality matched the price. One of the owners came by and was very personable. We heard about future plans and we gave our positive feedback. If you are in the area, stop by. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: it's a tavern that tries to act like a really good restaurant. In someways that can be a good thing, but in other ways it takes away from what locals are looking for. It's in a great location for the neighborhood, and the atmosphere is fantastic. Very bright and very open is a nice change from the low ceilings and closed in feel so many \"saloons\" try for in the area.   The drinks are a little pricey and I would really like to see more \"pub grub\" on the menu for those quick snacks on the way home. When I think tavern, I think nachos, wings, fish and chips or something else quick and simple. The pretzels and beer cheese are great, and I'd like to see other items such as that. It's also exciting to see that they are finally starting to distill, so I'll be interested in what comes out.  The staff really makes this place enjoyable. Misty is really good behind the bar but appears to be managing more and keeping things running well. A couple of the staff have turned over but others have remained and it gives that local feeling when you walk in and see someone you recognize. Side note - what's up with the new button down shirts? They have very nice T-shirts with logos available and it's a much more relaxed, casual atmosphere. The button down shirts on the staff seem a little out of place.  I'm excited to see Black Mountain Tavern and Distillery open and doing well, so I hope it remains for a long time to come."}
{"text":"We love this place! Such a hidden gem. It is a cute, family friendly place with lots of choices in beer and delicious upper scale bar food. Our favorite was the French fries with cheese curds on top."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and I've been to many many across US and other countries. Reason: I ordered the chicken sandwich that comes with a side salad. First bite, I'm thinking why is it crunchy? Could it be? No... take a second bite, crunchy and rubbery! I spit it out, look at the chicken and it is completely raw! Completely!!!! I have never had a restaurant serve me raw chicken. Have they heard of salmonella? The owner or manager (older lady) was right by our table so I showed her the chicken. She asked me if I wanted something else, I said no my appetite is pretty much killed after that. I told her just make sure you don't serve this to others (assuming she knows salmonella can kill). She says ok we're sorry. Bill comes. She charged me $3 for the side salad that comes with that dish! I had some of the salad BEFORE I touched the chicken and realized what': going on. She had the audacity to charge for the side salad. I am not a demanding customer but if I serve raw chicken (completely raw) to a customer, not only I won't charge them for the pathetic small side salad, I would also make sure the customer is happy so they are not tempted to talk shit about you. I was not going to write a review and just simply not go there anymore, but the mishandling of this horrible mistake needs to be public knowledge."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, and food! Misty and the entire staff were awesome. The gluten-free pizza is tasty. Fish n chips have great flavor and aren't greasy. We also tried the mac n cheese with chicken - deliciousness and packs a zing. We'll definitely revisit on our trips to Cave Creek. So much more on the menu we want to try. Oh, and the drinks were great!!"}
{"text":"First time!  As usual, we discarded the menu after getting the feel for the chef's ideas. I ordered my low carb standby; Cheeseburger, no bun, crispy (not burnt) bacon, caramelized onions and a side salad. Well they not only got it right the first time, the burger was exceptional! Perfectly prepared 1/2 pound and wonderfully seasoned. This place will be a great addition to our neighborhood. The bar looks to be well stocked and staffed with two tenders. The wait staff was attentive and on it! Never once did my iced tea run dry.  We will add this to our weekly quick and convenient dinner list."}
{"text":"I hate places on Yelp that say they are \"open\" & they have a \"late night\" menu but the kitchen is closed. Really... Waste of time. Came back during kitchen open hours. Food is good but no late night dining kitchen closes at 9pm."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened within the last year, but this place as severely gone downhill.  We used to get takeout weekly from this place and it was always pretty good.  Never great, but good.  But then the quality started to slip and the last time we ordered it was downright inedible. I ordered a club sandwich and it was so gross.  The deli meat tasted old and laden with preservatives.  The cheese wasn't real cheddar and the toasted bread was not toasted at all.  Really bad.  The service is pretty poor as well.  We always seem to catch them off guard when we call to place an order or when we arrive to pick up.  Not sure if they are short staffed or have new management.  We won't go back to find out."}
{"text":"My new favorite!!  Great menu...everything looked so good, it was hard to decide.  The waiter recommended the Beer Cheese Burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  Cooked perfectly.  Steak fries also perfect.  Ordered the Creek Punch which was yummy.  They have about 12 TVs and they are not a \"Packers,\" \"Steelers\", or \"Bears\" bar, so I'm pretty sure I can go there to watch my game come football season AND enjoy delicious food and beverages.  This place is so close to my house and so convenient.  We need more places like this in the neighborhood, so I hope everyone will try them and they stay in business for awhile!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff,  food and totally fun locals! Shout out to Brian, Tanner, Brooke and \"Alabama\" Darrel, Great place fun and good people!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Spicy Bloody Mary and the Mahi Sandwich with Kale Slaw. I was highly impressed with the food.  The Mahi was perfectly made with plenty of fish and great bread. The Kale Slaw was fresh with a kick of spice, not overly saturated with sauce,  a solid A+ in my books!  The Spicy Blood Mary was descent but not the 5 star you get in San Diego however a good 3.5 rating. Service was friendly and attentive. I will be back if I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today.  Ordered the Sonoran Chicken plate.  Two chicken breasts cooked cajun style over mexican rice and beans for about $12, not a bad deal. The food was very good.  Server was friendly and attentive, place looked nice on the inside and the food was very good.  I will come here again and this time might even try it after work hours so I can enjoy a drink.  I do wish the visibility to the street would be improved as I'm almost certain this is why other locations within this strip mall have failed.  Check it out, it is worth stopping in, and giving it a try."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and very attentive. The drinks are reasonably price and the beer is fresh and cold. They make their own vodka, they have an amazing chicken sandwich with crisp fries and the fish tacos are just excellent. The bar/restaurant is fun and the people are absolutely great to be around. Super friendly crowd."}
{"text":"First time trying out this local restaurant and left with a smile.  Beer cheese and pretzels were extremely good.  Must try that when you come.  Both of us had a burger and the meat tasted like good quality and was perfect seasoned. The fries appeared to be double fried because they were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Only thing lacking was Service as there was only two people working the floor this afternoon. That is probably due to us coming off hours. Still didn't stop us from rating this as a four as the food stood out over the Service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. We ordered off the lunch menu, the fish and chip, and Waldorf salad. We also decided to split a shot of vodka on rocks with some lemon because this place was noted as a distillery. The vodka was very smooth! Honey love the fish and chips, The fries were outstanding! The reason for only three stars is the salad it was just a bowl of greens with the chicken breast laid on top. Very disappointed what about all the other great things that go into a ward off salad? Will have to say the service was great also!"}
{"text":"We decided to forego the travel to known Scottsdale locations and try something local. Good Mojito, beer was coldish, and the food was terrible. Kraft macaroni and cheese for the kids, the scallops were a bit larger than bay, dry cold potatoes, uninspiring pork. As my daughter said \"daddy the food is kinda bland here\" sums it up. When the waiter brings boxes because no one ate that is usually the sign something went wrong.  Skip it. Probably not a bad location to grab some chips and a beer for a sports game at happy hour, but beyond that I'd look elsewhere.  FYI, the prices are about 20% higher than the pictures listed on this site pushing them into $$ 1/2."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the reviews are so great other than our waiter. The chicken wings were overdone and definitely not jumbo as described! The Caesar salad dressing wasn't close to the traditional or modern twist. The potstickers were overdone. The bar looks inviting."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and saw this neighborhood spot & wanted to try it, hoping it could be our new go-to spot. We went late in need of something to eat in the way home. We were thanked & welcomed right when we walked in! The place has a cool, modern vibe. The food was surprisingly excellent - not your routine bar food. The service and overall experience was excellent! We are excited to be in the same neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was disappointing, the distillery was not a focus of this place, which I found odd. The waitress seemed to be bothered by having to be there and barely spoke two words and never shared any insight about their in house distillary and products. The bloody mary was made with a mix and nothing special, my husband had one of their specialty cocktails \"troublemaker\" and that was pretty good. The food was terrible. I had the fish and chips and they tasted like burned old oil. The burger my husband ordered medium came almost rare.  Overall very disappointing experinece and overpriced for what you get.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Let me just start with this, the food was GREAT! But server A. was simply childish...  We started with an easy order of 2 beers .. simple enough.. 1 came right and promptly the other was the complete opposite... fair enough, we understand mistakes can happen - here on the wrong beer and size being delivered, and when we told our waiter that this order was wrong, he told us not to worry, this one was on them, cool!  Very nice.  The food came, and soon after the replacement beverage (and it was absolutely delicious!)  But then we were confronted with the bill charging us with the faulty order... No big deal, we will let the waiter know...  After telling our waiter about the mistake we could tell something was not right..  our waiter disappeared leaving us for a long period of time making us wonder why $6 extra was causing a huge fuss. Our waiter was long gone making us just want to leave, but we waited to be courteous and because I still wanted to give the appropriate tip.  Instead 15 minutes later the bartender comes over to ask what happened like he didnt know the details already.  Apparently they charged the card and could not give us back money so instead would give us a little gift card.  He hands us a card without telling us its value and really without caring like the mix up is our fault.  It was a $6 issue that turned into a waiting night of frustration and made us feel in the wrong for nothing!  Ruined our night and made us feel so childish over $6.     We still had to sign the bill after the event, and our waiter came right by almost with a smirk.  Why - we were so nice and understanding and we didn't want an extra beer or we would have ordered another.  We left half a beer and a nice tip.  This is too bad because the food was great, but we WONT come back just because of the service from A.   Cheers."}
{"text":"The burgers are some of the best in the area..90% of the time they will show up as the temp you ordered.   (I.e...rare,medium,ect)prices are fair...service is mid level, but what do you expect for a 10$ burger from a server right? I'm hoping the distillery aspect will offer more soon..they have their own vodka which I'm looking forward to trying"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to watch football!! The staff is VERY friendly, the food has always been good, and I like the atmosphere! The only thing I wish they had was a patio but that in no way changes my rating! If you live in the area definitely recommend giving them a try!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, our last two recent experiences at BMTD have been shockingly poor.  On Nov. 21, 2017 we went in for dinner around 5:20 pm.  Only one other party was in the restaurant at the time.  As we were all hungry, we figured we'd be in and out fairly quickly.  Well, while we certainly beat the \"rush\", they came in pretty quickly after we were seated.  On this occasion, there were only two folks working the front of the house: the bartender and one waiter.  It took over 50 minutes for our food to arrive.  Here's what we ordered: a cheeseburger, a Waldorf salad, and the Shrimp Yakitori.  Oh, and two iced teas and one diet coke.  That's it!  Nothing \"off the menu\".  Our waiter was tough to get a-hold of (he was scrambling), but I told him of our concern (we saw other orders going out to tables that had come in way after us), and he said he would check on it.  Well, we were thinking about throwing in the towel just as the food came out.  The quality was still pretty good, but the ridiculous wait left a bad taste in our mouths.  This is the second such time the kitchen has been inexplicably slow.  Not acceptable.  Too bad as there are few choices in Cave Creek.  Oh, and because there are so few choices, more and more families are coming in with (very) small children...so this \"Tavern & Distillery\" is becoming another un-special eatery."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Had the Cajun chicken sandwich and the buffalo chicken. Both were cooked perfectly! The chicken breast was pounded flat making it easy to eat. The brioche bun was moist and made the sandwich.  The server Taylor was so friendly and attentive and the ambiance was a 10! We came at lunchtime and it was nice and not too loud."}
{"text":"Black Mountain Tavern is one of the better 'sports bars' in the area. I had the Sonoran chicken. The chicken was over cooked and dried out.  The sauce and side dishes were excellent. Very nice beer selection and waiter was attentive. I believe that Brisams grill which is not very far away serves better dishes."}
{"text":"Seen this place on a tv show and wanted to check it out. I had the fish and chips but substituted rice for frys. The fish was good and a good portion but the rice was salty.  Would come here again tho and try the distilled stuff!!"}
{"text":"Buyer BEWARE!  Delayed this review after realizing that I had been charged for adult flavored beverages that we hadn't ordered nor consumed.  Upon returning with receipt in hand, I presented my dilemma to the staff. The manager responded with, \"Yeh, this happens a lot.\"  What?!?!  I was offered ONLY the amount of the overcharged beverages in the form of a restaurant gift card.  Nothing more.  No apology.  No real customer service.  No reason to return- except to be overcharged again.  The food isn't worth the drama.  Go some place else."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The 2nd time not much better than the first.  (Lucky we even came back after the first disaster). Manager on duty both times checked in with tables and parties all around us but never stopped to check on us.  It was apparent management only talks to people they know and are not interested in welcoming or getting feedback from new customers!   Drinks went empty.  When we ordered replacement beers for the table only one was brought.  Salad was just okay. Nothing special for the money -  I don't think We will be giving his place a third try."}
{"text":"Came here once. The burger was one of the best I've ever had. The Mac and cheese was way too spicy but it did say it had hot peppers in it so fair enough. The wait was insane but it's a new place and it was a Friday so that's not a big deal! Overall I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the Fish Tacos!!!! So nice to have them in the neighborhood! Service was good. But really... Try those tacos!"}
{"text":"Jane and I met up with friends here, at their suggestion to combine a nice meal with game 7 of the World Series. Got there just before game time and scored a nice table. Place filled up quickly after that. Despite being very busy everything was wonderful. Server Joseph was amazing and have no idea how the bar and kitchen kept up with the pace. Food was very good...try the pretzel dip...and the price was fair. Bottom line is that any place that can give this good of service across the board when packed with a rowdy crowd is a keeper. 5 stars on the old dude scale."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place. Good food and service. We usually stop by once a month or so"}
{"text":"Everything was good.   Decent flavors.  We'll come back again.  Fish tacos were delicious.   The buffalo chicken was good and mildly spicy.  Scallops were okay, but had some sand in them.  Waldorf salad was good."}
{"text":"so sad they cant keep in good help always a new manager  so now they are jacking the price on alcohol I have gone in there for over a year and I always  order a shot of Don Julio tequila its usually about 6 or 7 dollars a shot tonight it was 14.00 each wow I just about fell off my chair  I asked when this went up or was it a mistake its never cost this much they just blew me off didn't even get an answer never going back two cheeseburgers and two shots and two beers cost 70.00 I wasn't at the RITZ but I guess they think they are wow  terrible customer care"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. I had fish and french fries. The fries were good. The fish had twice as much breading as there was fish. After I peeled off five layers of breading, the fish was good. This seems to be a very popular local restaurant and bar. Service was slow. One of our friends had a burger and fries and said it was good."}
{"text":"So glad this place has opened.  Went in on a Friday, and was very busy.  However our service was prompt and the food was hot and tasty.  I had the fish fry and the hubs had fish taco both very good, but would have appreciated a non Fried option for both.  The menu seemed smaller Than what I had seen online, but that may just be a smart move as they just opened.   Hoping for an increased beer/wine selection and expanded menu,but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good Atmosphere alive Plenty of TV's Service a touch slow but I think it was more driven by the amount of patrons this night than any intent.... Staff polite and engaging"}
{"text":"A great little place in cave creek. Something it's residents had to wait a long time for. Add it to your go tos for yummy food and a cool atmosphere. Anything with their green chilies are amazing. They also have really good wings which is sometimes hard to find! In the beginning the service was a bit slow but they always haves  really friendly waitstaff so problems (if they arise) are handled really well!"}
{"text":"Phone is dying - but run don't walk to this great spot. Excellent vodka and Poutine!!!"}
{"text":"The location has a nice look inside. Place is pretty new. Average type American food menu. Burgers. Salads, Entrees are nothing special but so far tasty and cooked right. Our bartender seems to be distracted by some of the drinking pretty girls sitting at the bar and messed up our food order because he concentrates on flirting and sports talk rather then doing his job to satisfaction. The chef also joined the flirting party at some point. Not really professional. Overall ok not great."}
{"text":"It's the second time I've been there. Beer selection is decent. The first time had the potstickers. They were okay a little pricey for what they were. Yesterday I got the Margarita Flatbread. It was small and nothing special for the $12 or $14 that it was. Food value there doesn't seem that great.  Also there is no set hours they may close at 9pm when they are slow. So either go someplace to have a drink that you know will be open or call ahead to see if they are closed."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price. In my opinion they have the best food in the Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for game 7 of the World Series.  This was my second time here and it was a very busy night, but we managed to find the last two seats at the bar.  For such a big crowd we did receive excellent service from the bartenders, Jess and Jason.  Jason made me a delicious margarita or two. Since we were watching baseball, we ordered wings and poutine. The food came out pretty quickly.  The wings were tasty with a bit of a sweetness to them.   The poutine was yummy and rich although I would have preferred the pork was shredded rather than in chunks on top.  It would be nice to get some pork in every bite. We were checked on regularly, but neither of us were hungry enough to order more food. We will go back for sure to check on their entrees."}
{"text":"This is a very much welcomed new neighborhood spot.  The decor is warm and rustic with barn wood on the walls and a distressed bar top.  They will be distilling spirits soon which will be unique to the neighborhood.  I have been in twice and have had the mahi tacos and shared the poutine fries and the buffalo chicken flatbread.  It would be hard to choose a favorite but I would probably say the tacos (so far).  The portion was very generous and the fish was fried perfectly.  I am looking forward to sampling more of the menu.  Service was friendly, attentive and helpful.  This place has a great vibe and appears to be off to a great start!!"}
