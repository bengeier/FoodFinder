{"text":"We just found this place - they have the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Braised lamb or real turkey... all home-made... need I say more.. no processed meat here!!!  They also make their own bread, pastries, soup... etc.   They just opened 2-3 weeks ago - finally a good sandwich place!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and ordered a club. Overall I give it a meh rating. Portions were large but it was very messy and I had to wipe down my desk. Also there was a random bacon strip in it, I'm sure that was an accident. I think I will stick with Hannah's or Aroma. Overall lunch cost was $12."}
{"text":"Serious Sandwiches not only makes hot/cold sandwiches, they also have soup, pot pies, and a variety of desserts on the menu. 

Although they only opened recently, the line during lunch time can be quite impressive. They seem to be a little short-staffed, with two people working in the kitchen and one lady working at the cashier. 

Sandwiches are priced between $7.00-$8.50. I've tried the Serious Club, and it was delicious! The chicken chunks were a little dry and the marinara sauce can be a bit overpowering, but the bread is amazing & certainly fresh/homemade like advertised.

I gotta try their pulled pork sandwich next time. I saw someone else order it, and it looked delicious! 

Tip: I recommend wearing a bib when dining here because things are gonna get messy!"}

{"text":"After months of gourmet sandwich deprivation following the closure of our local Sandwich Box, I was hungering to find a new lunch spot that would know how to make their bread sing.

While there's no designing your own sandwich here, the options sounded delicious and would fit most palates, but most do come with red onions.  The two ladies behind the counter were very accommodating and sweet with us, as we took almost 15 minutes to decide what to order. When I asked about the onions, they said they could prepare my sandwich without them -- Bonus points right there!

Apparently the chef had to remove them manually (which gave me visions of my mother picking the onions of my McDonald's burger for me as a kid).  The staff did actually double-check to ensure this was okay and that I didn't have an allergy. Again - loving the service!

My Balsamic Chicken Wrap ($7) was actually two small wraps.  This place is not skimping on serving sizes! I grabbed the dripping, juicy wrap and bit in. This delicious mess was stuffed with green and red peppers, some lettuce and big chunks of marinated chicken and coated in the best mayo I've ever had. Apparently it's just the House mayo, but it took on a whole other level of flavor with the chicken.  I think a good wrap should always have a bit of drip. In fact, it's a necessity.

Another friend tried the Serious Club (a marinated chicken breast with bacon and more famous mayo) and said it was delicious ($8.50).  Sadly, the only failing was The Turkey Day sandwich. Meant to be a play on the Boxing Day leftovers, it has real in-store roasted turkey (not deli meat), stuffing and cranberries, but this one fell flat and bland.  My friend commented that maybe it needed to get doused in a side of gravy.  I tried a bite and agreed it was definitely not salty or messy enough to mimic true Turkey indulgence.

Overall, I think this place is great!  The chicken and veggies are the stars of the sandwiches.  And with a few modifications (offering the wrap in a whole wheat tortilla and adding another layer of flavor to the turkey sandwich) this place will soon have lunch lines out the door. Today there was no lunch line at 12pm, but I think this will change when word gets out.  Try this place if you are serious about fresh ingredients, house made sauces, friendly service, and of course, sandwiches."}
