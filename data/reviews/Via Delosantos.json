{"text":"After my second time eating at this establishment I was once again disappointed and will not be returning. You can get better Mexican food at the food truck in the Charlie's parking lot."}
{"text":"My husband took me to this place for our first date nearly 8 years ago, and we've been regulars since. Yes, it's not the fanciest Mexican food,  but that's not why we're regulars...the food is good and cheap, the margaritas are excellent, and my whole family is addicted to their salsa. Great joint that I hope stays in Phoenix for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Seriously been going to this place since I was a child! AMAZING FOOD! Service is great and everything on the menu is so tasty!!! When I go I usually go on a Sunday. I'm a super fan of their menudo and I had it today at lunch!!! Our waitress was kind and anticipated our needs! I would absolutely recommend trying the fried ice cream! I always get it without the chocolate. Not a fan of the sauce so I just get it with the whipped cream and I'm never disappointed! Also def recommend their tacos carne Asada in particular so yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have found in phoenix.   I have been here many times and have yet to try something that I haven't loved yet.  This place is a bit of a hole in the wall but to me that is what makes it even better.  Great cheap margaritas and excellent chips, salsa, beans and rice.  Every time I have been the service has been fast and really good."}
{"text":"Took the hubby and our 2 grown sons here for dinner last night. We were seated right away, and our server was very sweet and on the spot.  The chips were thin and salty, but ours were a little on the greasy side.  The salsa is good and the food is very tasty.  I had a Machaca beef chimi;  great flavor and all the fixins on top, but the meat needed to be cut up a little more...My son and I thought the meat was to stringy. My other son, he had the cheese enchiladas and beef taco...EXCELLENT.  House Margarita's where YUMMY, YUMMY! All in all, we went home \"happy gringos\" with our bellies FULL."}
{"text":"I actually love this place, very good food and excellent salsa.  Its a little seedy around the gills but has the biggest selection of tequila in the world.  99c margaritas are good but small, salsa's are very tasty with the gratis chips.  I'm not a vegetarian by any means but DO get the repollo and corn enchilada....its a fantastic mix of grilled cabbage and corn on a tasty tortilla.   mmmm, fabulous!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Vias since I was a little girl, 25+ years. Of all the Mexican Restaurants in the valley that I've tried,  It's my favorite. Great food, prices, and service!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to Mexican places. They have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. Their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. The servers are always consistently great. The only thing I don't like is their guacamole...it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a large group of friends (15).  I didn't hear any complaints about the food.  My chorizo con huevos burrito was good, but not great.  I ordered it with the green chili sauce and it was bland.  I ordered a \"top shelf\" margarita and specified Patron Silver tequila, but I'd bet that wasn't what was in my glass.  I couldn't really tell because it was an extremely light pour.  And the service...OMG!  Everybody working there moves at a positively glacial pace!  I had to ask repeatedly for water, salsa, etc.  And I didn't even consider a to-go box.  The final straw was when the busboy scraped leftovers from a stack of plates onto my plate right in front of me! Yuck!  That was disgusting!  I had intended to check out this place for happy hour, but unless I just want to sip tequila (after I watch the bartender pour it), I'll go elsewhere.  I don't understand what all the rave reviews are about."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE !  WILL NEVER GO BACK ... A dirty hole-in-the-wall ... $3 margs ... Good deal right ?  Yeah if you like the taste of dishwater and ass... According to the bartender, 3 ingredients in their house mix are water, OJ and sprite ... And from the taste of it, the water came from tje toilet ... Don't get sick ... Order top shelf ... The food is bland and greasy.  The service is rude, terrible ... Dont ruin your evening going here ... There are plenty of places to get good food and service like American Taco or many others.  But if you like abuse, terrible service, and sickening margs, by all means go here !!   I will never go back. Oh one of the salsas was good (Chipoltle flavor)."}
{"text":"We love it here!  We usually sit in the cantina because it's more fun and the bartender provides great service.  The margaritas are good and amazingly cheap - not just during happy hour!  Food tip: no matter what you order, you should have them put fundido sauce on it."}
{"text":"About as close to authentic old timey Tex Mex as Phoenix has to offer. Drinks are affordable as is the food. Lots of different tequilas. If you like trendy avocado Cali Mexican recommend you stay away (please). This place is traditional tacky, but if you like this style you won't be disappointed. Been seeing more and more German cars in the parking lot lately. Ugh."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best authentic Sonoran Mexican food in Arizona, no wait anywhere!!  This place seems like a total dump, but trust me the food is awesome!   Try their cheese crisps, chili relleno (anyone who likes this dish knows it pretty much sucks most places), Shrimp fajita burrito pollo fundito style... Some of their chicken dishes are not great, as I am not a huge fan of shredded chicken. Opt for the fajita meat instead.  Try hitting this place during dinner time on the weekend, and you will understand why all the locals to sunny slope don't tell anyone about this place. Unfortunately the wait during peak hours sucks, but worth the wait! Parking can suck so just park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. Also, *some* of the servers are not great, but again, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I will have to go there four times this week to achieve my goal as duke of delasantos (hiccup)"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a co worker that frequents the place.  Tacos, rice and beans were fantastic.  Jimmy the bartender is very friendly, and quick with service.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It's not exactly authentic but definitely unique in it's own sense.  The have a decent amount of vegan/vegetarian options especially for a Mexican restaurant.  The service is fantastic."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the valley.  Looks can be deceiving.  This place has the best chips and salsa.  They have a wide variety of menu items.  I always go for the chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite salsa in town, right now.  The old adage holds true: the less impressive the architecture, the more impressive the food.  You're not going to impress your boss with this Phoenix gem, but for an afternoon of $3 margaritas, or a BIG plate of flavorful food Via Delosantos can't be beat!"}
{"text":"food is off the hook!! I had 2 tacos with a spicey carne sada dish, rice an beans, My lady had the Chimi with rice an beans... The only thing is the service sucks, kinda rude ppl. I.found a Louie V purse in or booth, I turned it in Asap, I only hope they did the right thing."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE restaurant. I celebrated my birthday and they made us feel special! Before Darling Son, we came every week. We don't eat our as often now, but De Los Santos remains our go-to spot. There are fantastic choices for vegetarians as well as plenty of meat for the omnivores! Do it!"}
{"text":"Two colleagues and I visited this place for lunch today.  Only a so-so experience.  I have been to Via de many, many times having grown up in the Sunnyslope area.  They have consistently had good food and great margaritas.  But today's experience will make it tough to recommend.  We were seated promptly and had waters and chips and salsa soon thereafter.  We took some time to look at the menu and decided on 2 MaryLou's with red sauce and a green corn tamale.  They were all lunch specials that came with our choice of rice and beans.  The food arrived within about 10 minutes and everybody enjoyed their meal.    My major gripe about this place was the service.  Once our meals were delivered we didn't see a server again.  I had to stop a staff member who was passing by to get some water refills (we were all down to less than 1/2\" inch of water in our already small glasses).  No one came by to check and see if we were enjoying our meals or if we needed anything else to complete the meal.  When we were ready to leave, we had to go up to the front to get our bill and a to go box.  Via de is a place where you pay at the register but I still expect the bill to at least be dropped off.  They didn't appear to be exceptionally busy and I saw customers at two other tables looking around for someone to assist them.  Bad, bad service.  I don't know that I would head back when there are plenty of great Mexican food places in town with much better service."}
{"text":"I read about this place in a guide for Arizona and really wanted to check it since it is an authentic mexican restaurant. On our way to the airport from the Grand Canyon we briefly stopped here to pick up lunch. Since we didnt have time we ordered two take away burittos which we ate in the plane. This food even 3 hours later was DELICIOUS. i really want to go back to Phoenix just for this. The service was excellent too. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"This is out go to Mexican place. The food is the usual choices but taste is good . They accommodate my active 2 year old well but they are always busy!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Via was about a year ago for a friend's birthday. I was kind of surprised that she chose this little place 45 minutes away from her home in Tempe, but immediately understood as I walked into the front door.   It's kitschy-cute, loud, unpretentious, and STACKED with hundreds of different options of tequila. What's not to love?  The veggie-friendly menu is pretty awesome, too, and definitely a huge plus for a sit-down Mexican food restaurant. I've literally had cravings just for their rice alone. So good!  The house margaritas are something ridiculous like $2 or $3 a piece but are pretty syrupy sweet. I ask for half the syrup and a splash of ice water, and they're actually drinkable.   This may not be a place you want to go to for a romantic date or a 'light' lunch, but it will be the place that resonates in the back of your mind anytime someone suggests grabbing Mexican food. Listen to that voice."}
{"text":"Wow, were we pleasantly surprised.  Our first time here even though we reside in North Phoenix. Excellent value, and so many interesting vegetarian enchilada (and other) options! From the moment we walked in, the service was great, the staff attentive, the food fresh, not overcooked, not over cheesed, nor over sauced.... perfect! The least expensive glass of wine I've had out (under $4 and generously poured, and unexpectedly tasty for a house wine)! We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"The margaritas are always strong and the food is great. The service lacks at times, but everything else makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy \"Taco Tuesday\". They have cheap amazing tacos and their house margaritas are delicious. I normally would have something negative to say about a business, although that is not the case here.   You can definitely expect me here more frequently."}
{"text":"This place should change its name to Via De Los Banos. Pull up a chair and prepare to swat flies away from your plate!"}
{"text":"Via is a lot like that 10 year old beat up Honda Civic that got you through college and the first crappy job after. It's pretty reliable, you don't really want people to see you drive up in it, it's better than nothing at all, but you're always thinking about that time when you can finally get something better. Highs = chips/salsa and the margaritas. Lows = same old cheese and bean mess you always see and a nasty bathroom and smell at times. It's the North Central version of Tee Pee. Head South and go to Gallo Blanco if you have the time."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 20 years! I was born at the hospital next door lol  Best salsa and huge tequila menu. You cannot go wrong with anything you order. I wouldn't expect super classy. Its a neighborhood restraunt and has always been that way."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a few ladies and was surprised by the diverse selection the menu provided.   However, being that I was adventureous in even trying a new place,  I settled on chicken enchiladas for dinner with their white queso. I questioned going to this place altogether due to it's unfamiliar location, and while initially questioning my sanity/safety, i have determined their food is DEFINITELY worth dying for :)  One of the ladies i was with raved about their food prior to us arriving, so my expectations were set pretty high. She also mentioned they had good margaritas, and to my pleasant surprise she was right! And, um...hello $2.99!! Their chips were good, their salsa was lacking flavor/spice (IMO), but their white queso was phenom! Perfect amount of flavor and spice. And yes, notice i said WHITE queso. Saw someone else mention they only use yellow cheese. Last i checked, i wasn't color blind. Forgive me, I digress.  The other ladies ordered a bowl of the green chili, and a burro. Didn't try the burro, but it looked/smelled great and the green chili was also a success. To finish things off, we had their fried ice cream with half honey & half strawberry. WOW! First time i've had it, and i'll definitely be going back if only for their $2.99 margaritas and fried ice cream. It really is the small things in life that make us women happy :)  The staff was entertaining, attentive, and polite. My only complaint about my whole experience was that on the menu the enchilada I ordered indicated shredded chicken, and it wasn't. It was chunked/cubed, and in turn made it very \"chickeny\" (it was STUFFED with Chicken) In addition, it was ALL dark meat. I prefer white meat over anything, but I suppose \"to each their own\". I think i'll just try a beef or cheese lada next time.  All in all, very good experience, and at the top of my list for best Mexican in the valley!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is our consistent meat the Caris' joint at least one night a week. Chicken Quesadilla for the kids, burritos, enchiladas and baskets of mini tacos for the big kids. Plus a $3 margarita or three... the first time we went for a business meeting our server was about 150 years old, but bless her sassy heart she was fun and had no patience for us until we sassed her right back, then she was great. Since then, the younger staff has been great, even when we wipe them out of chips!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and drinks. Completly family run authentic mexican with super generous portions."}
{"text":"This is my chimi fix restaurant!  I cant believe I have been eating here regularly for a few years now and am just getting around to reviewing.   I always order the same thing... a plain cheese crisp and a red chile chimichanga.  It's a lot of food but soooo good."}
{"text":"Our favorite Phoenix Mexican place. Best salsa in town,!  We have been coming here weekly for over 10 years and look forward to another 10, it is that good. Service is OK but it is all about great local food."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for the size of portions. Very loud due to the fact many teenagers hang out for hours."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on Yelp and also was recommended by a local.  I'm from New York and there aren't a lot of great Mexican places there, so I was excited to get my hands on some authentic tacos.  My boyfriend and I ordered 6 chicken tacos.  While we waited for our order, we munched on some chips and salsa.  One of the salsas was tasty and had the right amount of spice.  The other tasted like the sauce from a Lunchables pizza.  We both agreed and joked about the taste but it didn't really bother us.  Here is where the two stars comes in:  We get our tacos and they are hard shell.  I really dislike hard shell tacos so I asked the waiter for an order of soft shell and offered to pay for my original order (I felt bad).  When the new tacos arrived, I was greatly disappointed.  The cheese looked like Kraft and both the lettuce and tomato looked like the cheapest produce one can buy at the grocery.  The worse part was the chicken.  The chicken was boiled and flavorless.  I forced myself to eat at least one.  My boyfriend felt the same way about his tacos.  The people there are really nice and sweet  but the food is really not good.  Maybe other things on the menu are better but after that experience, my boyfriend and I will not be coming back on our next trip to Arizona.  Fifty dollars down the drain :("}
{"text":"Great prices, excellent food, friendly staff and lots of tequilla"}
{"text":"This has become a regular spot to meet friends for dinner and margaritas. Food is great, prices are awesome and the margaritas rank amoung the best in the city."}
{"text":"Great house margs, and a very good price. Came in for tacos on a Tuesday (no Taco Tuesday specials but that's totally fine). I enjoyed my food! Ground beef taco, cheese enchilada and pinto beans. It was not memorable to me, but certainly was a very tasty meal at the moment. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love Via Delosantos. The food and service is great. The pomegranite margaritas are amazing! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the main dining room needs some TLC on the walls. Exposed drywall that's breaking into pieces (window seats) isn't very appetizing."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.  I love the fact that they serve grilled veggies and a wide variety of them.  I also enjoy their inexpensive margaritas, enjoy their chips and salsa, and the laid back atmosphere.  This is a true hole in the wall, but this establishment's food and margaritas are the treasure in that hole!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food never disappoints! Recommend the enchiladas and the burros, but everything is great here."}
{"text":"Very good, very affordable Mexican food.  The employees of the restaurant were very welcoming and friendly.  I went with Roman's Street Tacos, which is three carne asada street tacos with hot sauce, steak, onion, and cilantro.  They provide optional lime and lettuce on the plate as well.  The tacos were very tasty.  The meat was generously portioned and flavorful.  I saw a number of other dishes come out of the kitchen and everything looked good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican food restaurants in the valley.  Stay away from the Americanized dishes; instead go for the corn and cabbage enchiladas with while sauce, egg noodles covered in green chili, and assorted tamales."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes. We love the kitchy Mexican decor, local drunks at the bar and awesome Phoenician staff. As residents of the (re)developing neighborhood, we couldn't be happier with this restaurant. The happy hour menu is big enough to call it dinner. The margaritas definitely do their job and are delicious to boot! Good place to meet up with friends and hang for a few hours. They serve green corn tamales, which is becoming rare for Mexican places and something we greatly appreciate!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to be well known to the locals but hidden to tourists. We just happened to find it when visiting and were pleasantly surprised.   The waiter and others on staff were very friendly. I had the spinach con papas (potatoes) enchilada with rice and black beans and my husband had the veggie fajitas. Both dishes were delicious and plentiful. We were served 2 salsas, both homemade and delicious. The chips were good. I had a frozen margarita that was just average. I wouldn't order it again, but would try on the rocks. The flavor was ok, but I had lots of shaved ice left over.   We made special dietary requests (vegan) and they were happy to accommodate us.   We ate in the bar and it was fun. They had a jukebox with every type of music that you can imagine and TVs. It's not a fancy place, but very homey, comfortable, and affordable."}
{"text":"Been going here with my family for the past dozen years. Great place. Friendly service, good margaritas, and great chimichangas and pollo fundido."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  I was introduced to this place when I first moved to Arizona, and has been my go to place for Mexican food since.  Whenever I get company in town to visit I always make sure this is a trip we make out to eat.  Great food, decent prices, and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great bar; particularly for day drinking!  Dingy, dirty and glass hasn't been cleaned since....well maybe never, but the bar has character that is solely lacking in many spots today. Tacos are good and menu seems pretty affordable. Only had Tacos but other food I saw come out looked bomb, and portions were pretty bigly! As for the question below inquiring about 'Gender Neutral Restrooms\"? They have a Men's room for Men and a women's room for women, which is all they need."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! It's the kind of Mexican food you can eat once a week, it's great every time! We always ask for Katrina as our server, she is always friendly and attentive. It's definitely a little \"hole in the wall\" but seems to be very clean. Great food, great service, we love it!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I really, really don't.  People swear by this place.  I know people that have gone here for years, and for that reason I gave it my three strikes chance.  If a place has potential, or great reviews I will generally give it three tries to see if I had just missed something previously before I will take it out of my rotation of restaurants.  Well dear Via Delosantos, you're out!  This place is a hole in the wall, so you expect it to be a lil quirky,  but I always left feeling like it was more towards dark and dingy. The service was never anything to impress on my visits, on my last visit it took around 8 minutes for our server to show up in the first place and I was considering walking out all together.  The food here is mediocre.  Definitely nice sized portions, and there are a couple winners to choose from, but with a menu this large it is expected that there will also be some losers as well.  They pride themselves on their margaritas, and maybe I am just used to stronger pours elsewhere, but I found them to be pretty weak.  Basically, I find this place to be lackluster.  I am all about supporting the mom and pop, but there are plenty of other local Mexican restaurants to choose from, so all these people that swear by this place can keep it, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap margaritas! I've been a fan of this place since I was little! Really great mexican food and the best salsa around. Always a fun trip in with friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious! definately a little hole in the wall but its great! haven't ordered anything I didnt like :) a must try."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  I have lived here for over 25 years and have been around most of the well known Mexican food places  from upscale Scottsdale to dive South barrio.  Via De is the best there is.  Their Pollo Fundido is the best and their burro selection can't be beat.  My favorite dish is the Calupas with a side of grilled corn.  If you are looking for the best Mexican food in a casual family friendly environment or if you like a W I D E variety of Tequilas to choose from, come here  I know they don't serve any IPA's, but hey, Mexican food deserves a Mexican beer or a margarita anyway."}
{"text":"Above average food & average service, but it made me feel like I was in a Rocky Point dive bar.  Who doesn't love Rocky Point?  Good margs and a ton of tequilas to choose from.  Pricing on food was more than fair for the quality and portions."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  About a year ago my husband and I both became violently ill a few hours after eating there, and after reviewing what we ate in common determined it had to be the salsa.  So we stayed away until Sat. night when we decided to give it a try again.  The place has always been scary by its appearance but we were amazed how much it had run down in just a year.  Everything was dirty, from the floors on up, including the inch of grime covering all the crap hanging on the walls, which keeps them from really cleaning or putting a badly needed fresh coat of paint on the place.  There are holes in the booths with stuffing spilling out and there was a big smear of dried salsa on the mirror hanging right next to my head.  All very unappealing!  Add to that stale, tough tortilla chips, a very bland green chili burro and watered-down Margarita and I'm writing off an old favorite.   Unless you really like the dangerous feeling you get when you walk into a border town dive, stay away!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Funky little Mexican cafe. Food was in generous portions. Atmosphere was just what you'd expect from a family-owned place, colorful and busy.  The tamales were very very good. Margaritas were fantastic. Our entrees were pretty solid. I would have liked a bit more spice to mind but overall I was pleased. For the price it was  a good dinner.  Service was a little slow and spacey. I'd say it's a decent stop to make."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food that I have enjoyed in a long time. Chips and salsa are fresh. Margaritas are strong, delicious, and 3$! The plates are filling and flavorful, the specialties are always a winner. Service is great, but I also don't expect servers to kiss my  bum. Feels like your in Mexico, without the drug lords, food is always good when I come! Mmmm good, that's all I can say."}
{"text":"This is our local hole in the wall Mexican place. All the locals go here and are repeat customers. Sit in the bar is possible. First start with the house margarita on the rocks. It's the best in town, not overly sweet like other places.  The chips and homemade salsa are very good and we always finish 1 if not 2 orders. The polo fundido is excellent, as well as the 2 tacos with rice and beans. This place is not for everyone ( Scottsdale attitude will not enjoy). We take all our family here every time they come to visit and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Wait 15 min it wasn't even crowed they sit us down nobody waited on us 15 min. We left very dirty & old. For the best the kitchen probably was gross"}
{"text":"Salsa had no heat, not even the hot one.   food was flavorless and over cooked.   Service was horrendous.   Nothing to say good things about.   Vegetable fajita had no seasoning and tasted canned and greasy.   Fish fajitas also lacked seasoning and fish was cut into small pieces and treated as though thawed.   Guacamole tasted store bought.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! I can't find authentic Mexican food like this anywhere else. Everything on their menu is great and their chips and salsa are THE best."}
{"text":"Man I haven't been here in Forever at least 10 years back then the food was not very good service sucked but they didn't have the best margaritas and I really cheap price 4 things have changed food has gotten a lot better not the greatest but still pretty damn good prices are good I had the tostadas which the tortillas are nice and crispy not soggy and you get a lot of places I liked the beans and it was loaded full of cheese and vegetables it was great chips and salsa or average service really good on top of things and fast and she had quite a few tables taken care of I was very impressed with her and guess what the Margaritas are so great at least the house when is plus they have like a hundred different types of tequila I think definitely start going back here"}
{"text":"If I can add a half I totally would be at a 3.5 on this place.  The Mexican food is probably the best I have had in Phoenix.  The price is very good.  The service was fair, skip the guac but I would recommend two magaritas."}
{"text":"Great margaritas at a good price. spicy chorizo dip it delicious. Staff is really friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"This bar must have the largest selection of tequilas in the west with 180 choices. The bartender mentioned, at one point they had over 300. I was introduced to this one of a kind establishment by a friend and immediately became a big fan!!  Small in size it packs a huge impression, as you walk in and admire the abundance of premium tequilas on display. Inside the bar, empty tequila bottles hang upside down from the ceiling that surrounds a cozy bar. Ordered the Tacos, because that's what goes best with tequila & beer and they've done themselves proud to make a great tasting crispy taco!  Prices for food and tequila match the quality of choices, but it can get expensive if you enjoy top shelf tequila. Can't wait to come back and sample other unique choices."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a local who had never been here, but was told this place had great, authentic food. Unfortunately, the majority of the menu consists of the same old Americanized-Mexican food that you will find at most Mexican places. There are a couple of standouts - the salsa verde chili Colorado was pretty good. The bowl of chili app was pretty good as well. Tequila selection is extensive. Overall, nothing really to rave about. A solid meal, at a decent price. Service was fast and friendly. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Oh my! This was an unexpected find! And to think I almost missed it! You will see a ton of elderly white people going into this hidden gem-- but do not be afraid! It is not one of those bland, Mexican for people who don't know anything about Mexican food places.  You know what I'm talking about.  And I know I'm probably ageist and racist or whatever, but when I see only white folks over the age of 65, I think bland.  I think Taco Bell and chimichangas.  Sorry, that's been my experience. Well... This is not that kind of place! OMG! The fry bread with green chile stew was the start of our gluttony, but it was only the start.  The chile rellenos were outstanding.  The huevos con chorizo-- awesome.  The beans and rice on the side-- perfect.  Chips and salsa were also way better than average.  Next time, I think I'll just have them bring me a trough of the obscenely good green chile stew!  I am too stuffed right now to contemplate it.  I can't make this a habit or I'll be buying bigger pants.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.  Though you may have to get bigger pants..."}
{"text":"The restaurant as advertised is filthy which is inexcusable.  Service was good and the chips and salsa were excellent. However the Pollo Fundido  which was advertised as being excellent was far from it. The sauce was skimpy and the worst part was the inside was about 3/4 of the cheapest cut of dark chicken mixed with just a little bit of white meat thrown in. The refried beans were runny and the rice was bland. Overall would not recommend coming here when there are far superior options available in Phoenix."}
{"text":"An excellent choice for authentic Mexican food. The bottomless chips and salsa the waitress brought at the beginning of the meal were excellent. These were constantly refilled throughout our meal.   My personal favorites are the carne asada and the cheese, beef and jalapeno nachos. My dining companions enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and the cheese quesadillas. There is a list of tequilas available for every taste. They have Dos Equus Amber on tap (my favorite). The sopopillas for dessert are the best in Phoenix.  The decor is shopworn but comfortable. The service is very good without being intrusive. There is parking available in their lot or on the street. They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Bad service slow service seriously how long does it take to serve a glass of wine and a tostada ? Well I guess about 53 minutes !  NEVER EVER again.."}
{"text":"Not that bad but honestly a hybrid of Top Shelf, Garcia's, Manuels, Macayos.... Sorry, but really not sorry. It's just ok at best Mexican food. My wife had the #15 combo, 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I had #8, two shredded beef tacos, with rice and beans. Of course chips and salsa were served. The salsa was weak and was just a notch better than Pace. The taco sauce could have been from a jar also.  My tacos lacked any rich flavors, and not only were the shells stale, they were cracked beyond even being able to be held. Would have made a good taco salad. The rice and beans had an odd odor, which I think was old grease or lard. The beans were super bland and the rice was just nasty. If I am going to raise my cholesterol level, I usually expect top notch artery clogging fare. This isn't a place to obtain Crestor helping levels. Two other places are better if you ask me, hands down - Carolinas and Guadalajara.   I will leave this joint to the local area patrons looking to get their buzz on in a run down (basically a bar) joint slinging some premium tequila and cheap house Margs.  I don't think I will circa de Los santos instead of traveling via the saints!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by the front desk clerk at the Sheraton Crescent. She said it is their first recommendation for authentic Mexican food in the area. She described it as a mom and pop hole in the wall with great food. She was so right. I had a combination plate with a tamale, cheese enchilada and a beef taco. The enchilada sauce was exquisite with an amazing texture. The red chili beef tamale had a nice kick to it and the cheese enchilada was a nice balance on the plate. Also try one of their specialty margaritas."}
{"text":"Too much flour in the sauce. I want them to do well, but they need to put more flavor--spices, herbs-- and less fat."}
{"text":"Really...filthy dirty place...cant imagine what the kitchen looks  like..went for happy hour on taco tuesday with a friend was told by bar tender no happy hour food at booths you must order entree, happy hour only at the bar..which is filled with old time regulars who probably tip less than 2%...why let them stay all day and they look like they match the interior... filthy vents..holes in the walls..stains of food on the walls...never will i visit this filthy dirty resuraunt ....."}
{"text":"Not the same as it used to be.  Watered down margaritas and food was just ok.  We used to come once a week.  Not anymore.  Seems like new management?"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant offering great Mexican food in a casual atmosphere, and at Great prices. This is not a trendy chain restaurant, but a local favorite.This is the home of the 99cent Margherita.   They have good chips and homemade salsa. Their food is fresh and well prepared. They offer a full bar in this fun and friendly restaurant. The decor is interesting and fun...we have enjoyed this place for many years."}
{"text":"Great reviews, big disappointment.  Cute place, I felt like I was in Mexico. Good chips. okay salsas. Food . . . chile relleno was a salt trap, green corn tamale was not exciting, my friend's pasta dish was entirely bland and kind of a goulash without sauce.  I did something I've not done in 20+ years here in Phx: I left more than half my meal on the table.  When I rejected a to-go box, the hostess/server didn't bat an eye . . . Service, nothing special.  Too bad.  My friend and I love Mexican food (not Americanized, either) but we'll cross this one off our list."}
{"text":"Not as good as it once was. Last two visits have been disappointing with cold food and poor service. Recipes are sound but the staff seems burned out. Via con Dios amigos, we are taking our weekly business elsewhere."}
{"text":"IN LOVE! This hole in the wall is amazing. Don't let the appearance lead you a stray! the staff is awesome and always waiting on you in a quick manner. The food is great authentic food that is very fresh. The margaritas are fantastic and very cheap. I need to learn to venture out on this menu, but I usually stick with what I know and order a number nine. I love bringing out of state family here to experience this gem. I might become a well known customer real soon as the pace I enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Met up with some of my favorite folks last night because I NEEDED some cheese enchiladas paired with a margarita or two.  This little place has great service and really nice servers and wait staff...it was an enjoyable evening from start to finish.  The food is good ol' sonoran-style and I changed up my regular order to include green chile .  Yum Yum Yum!!!!  I like the fact that there are vegetarian options and the prices are really reasonable.  One of my friends has been eating there weekly for several years now so that's a pretty high recommendation.  I'm finding out that they have other regulars as well.  Still looking for the perfect red sauce but this place is OK in my book."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burro enchilada style with guacamole. It had absolutely no flavor. With so many good Mexican restaurants around there is no reason to eat here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great friendly staff, and really good food! Love sitting in the bar area, where you can get any kind of beverage you wish for, chips , salsa, food, all at very reasonable pricing. I would have like a little more heat to the green chili, but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible!! My wife dragged me here once again last month for her birthday and it was our last!! Here's how the nite went - sat down waited 15 minutes before we flagged down a busboy for chips and water. Chips came out hot and fresh with some tastey salsa! Thats when we should have left! We finish our chips and salsa - still no waitress, no menus and no waters!! And not just us mind you, the entire section!! Finally, a waitress gets to us and asks are you ready to order? Again, no water and no menus!! After another ten minutes makes her way back with water and menus and we order. Food comes out in five flat!! Precooked slop! Fish tacos stunk! No flavor - all fishy smell! Heres the kicker - shes drops a check on the table when we start eating and then gone again! She never comes back - no refills, no boxes for the kids meals, nothing! Again, this is the entire section!!! Well, I was going to skip out on the bill but, I paid and of course left her zero tip! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN!! My wife even apologized to me about going there - on her birthday no less!! AVOID! THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay nothing to rave about.  Sorry to say not authentic Mexican food.  Typical Mexican food served at a Mannys or Macayos.  Hostess not very friendly, servers said we could not order from her, it had to be from waitor/waitress.  Instead of saying \"Let me get her/him for you\" she walked away.  More attention needs to be paid to cleaning as restaurant was dirty, walls very dirty.  Pretty sure I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is good Mexican food.   I wouldn't say it's THE best but it ceratainly is good.     The chips are pretty much what you'd expect (thin and crispy).  The salsa is very good and will make you keep dipping buckets of chips.   I had a Carne Asada buritto.   I liked it.  It tasted good (spicy, good meat, good texture, etc.).  The tortillas are good as well.   I say good a lot because I wasn't blown away by the taste.    One of my friend also had a carne asada burito and agreed with my assessment.  My other friend had the carne asada fajita plate and really liked it.  They have an EXCELLENT tequila selection.   You will not be disappointed.   There were equal compliments about the margaritas.    The ambiance is authentic mexican.   It is a family owned establishment with a long history in town.  It definately feels this way when you are in the restaurant.   Overall, this is an \"A-OK' place to eat and drink.  You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Part of me really wants this place to have 3.5 stars...damn Yelp!   Anyhow, my rating is as follows:  Location: 2 stars, though something is oddly mysterious about this place.  Service: 2 stars, ALWAYS have bad service.  Food: 5 stars!!!  Yea!!!  I discovered this place when a good friend of mine took me here.  He said you will love it...I did...well, the food at least.  This restaurant is located in the Slopes, so come locked and loaded.  98% of the time this place is PACKED and their parking lot is super small, which means crappy parking in general.  I have had issues with this and have had to park in the neighborhood or in the establishment across the street.  The facility itself is rather small too, which is maybe why it always seems busy.  Upon entering I have found that it takes a while to be greeted.  The wait staff runs around frantically, although it only seems like I have ever seen only the 3 same servers each time I go.  The bar is located to your right and is small (sorry happy hour goers), and there are two separate seating areas, with seating outside.  For the tequila lovers, you have A LOT to work with!!!  Their selection is huge.  I often just close my eyes and point, and there is my shot for the evening.  They also have cheap margaritas too if that is your thing, with your basic beers on draft and bottle.  The ambiance is filled with old decor, but adds to the theme of the place, making it cozy in some aspect.  There is a large variety of food to select from on the menu.  I usually have the carnitas or carne asada.  ALWAYS delicious, never questionable.  I LOVE their chips and salsa.  To me, a good Mexican food restaurant in my book MUST have good chips and salsa to be considered worthy of return.  I just don't eff around with this.  They have this covered!  The only thing I can really complain about in this case is the service.  It always seems like it takes forever to be greeted, forever to have the wait staff take our drink order, then forever to return with them, then another eon to take our food order, and another eon for refills, and even longer for the check and processing.  Why is this?  Can someone please explain it to me?  If you are on a time crunch, this is NOT the place to go.  So, with that in mind, I leave you with the humbling message to try it out!  If you can tolerate their lack of prompt service and risky neighborhood, than you are a okay and ready for take off.  Bring a group of friends, have some shots, eat some good food."}
{"text":"usta come here a lot several years back. It was one of the best places in the valley. Now the menu has a lot of things blacked out. The Mexican spaghetti I ordered was so dry I was dumping salsa on it to eat it. After I was finished the waiter told me I could of ordered an Alfredo type sauce for it. Thanks for the heads up. I would never order it with out it. The service wasn't bad and my friends got more than they could eat. They both enjoyed their dishes, chimichangas , but mine was bland and dry."}
{"text":"I love this place, the bar is really small but it's totally cool.  This is what I call a local neighborhood restaurant/bar.  Great food and I just tried the Carna Picada for the first time and it's my new favorite dish.  If you like jalepenos and carna asada (or pork) you can't go wrong with this dish.  Make sure you try one of the house margaritas, they are $2.99 all day, every day.  Salsa is really good and so are the chips.  This is an old school Phoenix Mexican restaurant, you can't go wrong.  I am docking it 1 star because I think the carna asada could be trimmed better, I have had some fatty pieces before in my meals.  This is something easy to fix, they just need to pay closer attention to the details."}
{"text":"I have gone to a lot of mexican restaurants and being mexican i know how real mexican food tastes and Via Delosantos is the closest one ever. I love enchiladas and i was never satisfied until i found Via Delosantos. So if im craving enchiladas i know exactly where to go."}
{"text":"Never ever fails to disappoint for the best Mexican food in the valley. It's been open for many years, it's family owned, and the quality is great. I always skip the bar after my youthful failed frozen margaritas and just go for the combos on the huge menu. Their enchiladas are excellent and the owner is so nice!"}
{"text":"Good food.. reasonable prices.. definitely not a chain restaurant. The waitress was happy to wait on us and really cared what we thought of the food.. The atmosphere is vintage, not the cleanest place, but have been there a few times and always had a good meal."}
{"text":"Authentic old school Mexican restaurant. I love their albondigas and green chili burritos. Friendly staff and very well priced!"}
{"text":"i really hate this place.  but i have spent a lot of time here.  cheap drinks. decent salsa. and old men who buy these drinks for you is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This is a review for our visit in August 2017.  Via Delosantos is the place to go for delicious traditional Phoenix style Mexican food.  A hidden gem for us during a staycation.  Loved the salsa and the bean burrito.  Our waitress was attentive, and even though the restaurant was busy, our food came out fast and our drinks were filled promptly."}
{"text":"The salsa is by no means hot, but always taste fresh and delicious.  As for the notorious .99$ margaritas... I think they are now $2 but still definitely get you messed up and are tasty enough for only 2 bucks. It puts some people off that the margaritas are poured from a tap like a draft beer, but once you have two or three you are fine with it.  I witnessed such a lady make an issue with the draft margarita who insisted on having it shaken in a cocktail shaker. The bartender reassured the senorita that this was the house margarita that everyone was enjoying. She just couldn't wrap her head around it. I wanted to say \"Listen lady, Its $2... and it will get you fucked up, just enjoy it\"! But my reserved nature dictated otherwise. The atmosphere and the food are above average, standard Sonora Mexican fare that is not very spicy.  The location is ideal if your buddie's girlfriend is having a baby at John C. Lincoln hospital and you want to have the \"Holy Shit! your a Dad\" talk over 3 pitchers of margaritas. Because when you are done he can just walk back over to the maternity ward while you finish your green chile quesadilla."}
{"text":"So a normal Friday night with family and friends turns into worst nightmare imaginable.  First of all Mexican Pizza was cold, meat was dry, and olives taste like rubber.  Service was substandard with waitress bringing extra drinks without request.  Owner at 11:00 is drunk or something, starts a fight with a patron across the bar from me.  I witnessed the scrum started by the owner and other employees.  The owner is lucky he is not being sued by the man he struck. I immediately left with my wife in case things got worse.  Definitely not a place I would recommend!  Please stay away from there at all cost, something isn't right..."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything I don't like here. The carne asada taco has been a go-to for me. But it seems like one of those places you keep trying new things and keep liking them. Definite to return!"}
{"text":"the salsa was very spicy, the chips  were luke  warm, liked their green pork   burrito. the green corn  tamales were dry and hard . rice was overcooked. i would rate  the restaurant  a little better than average, service was attentive"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is a dive of a joint, but you will not be disappointed! They have 200 tequilas in the bar and their bartenders are always fun! It's a family owned business that serves really really good mexican food - their fundido is amazing!  The atmosphere is so so fun, we always have fun in a crowd there.  Their waitstaff is wonderful - they give you good suggestions and are really friendly.  A must visit and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"WoW! Wowie, wow! Food was sooooo good. Tastes authentic, it's rare I can actually say that. Chips & salsa=great.  Chips were thin, warm & fresh. So many tequila choices...OH MY! I had a margarita=$3 good. The pollo funido burrito dinner was so yummy, two can share it. It's delish and a LOT! Tried the beef flautas, they were ok. Beans and rice were done perfectly. Place is yummy and worth the trip and cost. Will venture out again sometime."}
{"text":"Not much to add to my review from July. I had the same dinner, the same drink.  LOVE it...LOVE it.   Keep the margs and warm tortilla chips coming!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, aside from that I wish there was a location in my neighborhood! A friend and I came here after receiving recommendation from the hotel we were staying at and I'm so glad they did.  The service was great - our meals arrived in hardly no time at all. And they were DELICIOUS. The margaritas were great, and STRONG.  Our waiter was the sweetest, and checked on us regularly to make sure our waters and margaritas were full. It seemed family owned/run, so I'm not surprised by the level of attention, but it was still a great surprise."}
{"text":"Lots of character. Food was good. Waiter was attentive. My beef Flauta was better than the chicken. But think they used corn tortillas rather than flour.   Lots of food choices.   Mom liked her Chile relleno and cheese enchilada.   Bathroom could use some updating.   Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Although I don't think this is the best Mexican in town, they are close. I crave the spinach and asparagus enchiladas with the white sauce. That is for sure the best enchilada in town!"}
{"text":"Always on point. Best pollo fondito in town and amazing service. We love this little cantina!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week and have been for several years. In all that time I have yet to have a bad meal or service. I have eaten at dozens of places in Phoenix but this is our favorite spot. Good solid Mexican food that is consistent. There are fancier places, but no one beats the price and service."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers that the appearance of this place may turn some people away, but that is all the better for you because you will get a table faster.  If you go on the weekends prepare to wait 20-40 minutes, but it is indeed worth it.  The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.  The parking sucks,  the servers are sometimes not nice and the place sort of looks like something in a bad dream featuring Antonio Banderas and a mariachi band,  but the food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"I was a little uneasy coming here just based on the area around however I quickly found that for real authentic mexican food, not a whole lot can compare.  What I love about this place is that it is true mexican food.  Places like Macayos and Garcias may be good but they try to slop so much chile and baja sauce on everything that it really loses out on the real flavor.   However, Delosantos is delicious.  I always get the Via Chalupas which is some sort of marinated beef (carne asada) soft tacos.  They are massive and comes with 3 per order with rice and beans.  They are mouthwatering.  I never have to add salsa or sour cream to them and have never been disappointed with those.  Most of my family loves to get some form of the tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  Just depends on what they want mroe of that night I guess.  And the cheese crisps may be simple but they are cooked great everytime.  I don't drink however others in my family will dine on pitchers of margaritas there and they absolutely love them.  I myself hate tequila so no thanks but to each their own.   The chips and salsa are staples but the hotter of the 2 salsas has the best flavor in my opinion.  The regular has too much cilantro in it for my liking and I could do without it.    I had tried the chimichanga initially going there and it ws good but nothing too special.  But overall this place has solid mexican food, a friendly staff, and although it might be small and you may have a few minutes to wait, it is well worth it.    I'm giving it 3.5 stars because I haven't tried the entire menu and I am very particular when it comes to Mexican food.  But from what I have tried, well done!"}
{"text":"Remarkable!  I had the huevos rancheros and the underlying tortilla was soft and fresh. Two salsas, of course, both with clear tomato flavors present. The coffee has what I thought was a touch of Mexican chocolate but it turns out was a hint of cinnamon added. Delicious!  The beans were light colored and flavorful as was the rice.  I am a vegetarian and the options on the menu were extensive for folks like me.  If we come back to Phoenix we will definitely, definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!!! I had the pollo fundido and it was amazing!! I would want to try something else next time but I'm Kinda craving the pollo fundido already!! Definitely going back next time we are in the area!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm ... tasty. My friend and I split a giant entree for maybe $15, two frozen margaritas at $3 each, and I had a draft beer for $3.5. The meal for two was $40 with a generous tip. The ginormous tamales were especially memorable. It was what I expect Phoenix to be. And the cuisine is different from Mexican in Dallas or Albuquerque. Nice fresh salsas."}
{"text":"I mean it was ok. Nothing special. The food is pretty good but there are just so many other better places. The inside is just ok too. Sorry not sorry y'all!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place, although the $.99 margaritas are pretty good.  Great place to come on a Friday afternoon for a liquid lunch.  I though their food was bland for Mexican and rather uninspired.    If you aren't a huge Tequila fan, there are better laces out there in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I have to say this place one of the best Mexican places I have had since moving to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Period. Nothing compares to their delicious cheese-crisp, fresh tortilla chips and yummy salsa. Oh, and their machaca beef enchiladas with a little extra cheese will have you turning your car around by the time you reach Bethany Home and uncontrollably driving back for round two.*   Their service can be a little rough around the edges at times, but in the end it really doesn't matter. You didn't go to this place to bitch and moan about service; you went here to eat the best dinner you've had all week.   My only last piece of advice... eat a lot early on in the game, their dessert leaves a lot to be desired. They could get some legit honey for the sopapillas (vs. Kraft packets), and the fried ice cream is so-so."}
{"text":"One of our favorite hangout spots. Tortilla chips and salsa made fresh daily. Roman street tacos are yummy. Love to go on a hot summer day cause the A/C is ice cold in the bar area. Sure, the place is worn but it has character. A pitcher of margs and some DosXX and you won't want to leave this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Food is outstanding and the margaritas are solid, with everything being a fairly reasonable price.  Only things keeping it from being 5-stars is that the service can be hit or miss depending on who your server is and the seats (particularly the booths) aren't all that comfortable.  Really like the outdoor seating as well but it would be better if they had something else going besides cheap plastic patio chairs."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times & it has always been a nice experience. I went in the other nite by myself & the bartender told me to grab a seat so I chose a booth. It was @ shift change so he grabbed me a drink & then Mike (the new bartender) came on. There was an older man wasted @ the bar who was going on re how he'd been there drinking nonstop since 1030am ( it was now 6ish). He was yelling all kinds of profanities & talking about getting weed & getting high then says that he needs his keys so he can drive home. I said to Mike that he should order the man an Uber & he snarkly replies,\" he's not my problem!\" & walks away from me. Fast forward a few moments & the old man fell backwards off his barstool & slammed his head on the step & was OUT!!!  Ppl jumped up & literally Mike stepped right over him & carried on..... like it was no big deal!!! He never once acted like he cared. Fd comes & after they left, Mike came over completely cleared my table & gave me my check!!! I said is there a problem? He said, you need to go, I need that table..... now mind you in my 45+ years, I've NEVER had that happen!!! I said I didn't realize I was done. Then he says, you can sit w them ( referring to the couple in the booth next to mine WHO I DID NOT KNOW!!!) The whole thing was so bizarre!!! Then he tells the 2 guys who were sitting @ the high top next to my booth that they could have my booth!!! My head was spinning!!! I was seriously confused!!! Again, never had that experience before."}
{"text":"I have 2 words for you: Fundido Sauce. That's all you need to know. Go forth and conquer."}
{"text":"I had the Pollo Fundido which was awesome.  Chips and salsa were good as well, and the waitress brought us hotter salsa upon request.   Service was fast, prices are reasonable.  The Fundido was $9.95, with beans/rice was $12.95.  It looks like a small hole in the wall place, but it's right in the heart of Phoenix and fits in with the area. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Via de Los Santos for 28 years. Food is amazing Sonoran style, margaritas are delicious and fairly priced and the service is great! However, I had to give them a 3 star rating based on food portions. I have noticed that the food portions are getting smaller and smaller every time. Not on all dishes but on those that require fish or meat. I've noticed that they have increased their prices (understandable) but either you increase the prices or reduce the portions but never both. I hope management notice and make some modifications."}
{"text":"Yummy food and the BEST service!  Rick was our server and was amazing!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The waitress was wonderful!!! Very friendly, she made the experience worthwhile. Great margaritas and the chips and salsa - whew! Wonderful! Chile Relleno, not so much. Too much breading. I would go there again, though and try something else."}
{"text":"Tried one more time. Better than last, but still not up to where it was in the past. So sad."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant with really good Mexican food. Huge menu lots of variety and choices. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my pollo fundito was dark meat chicken and I expected Breast meat. My mistake for not asking, usually it is chicken breast. Our mucho macho meat burrito was very good. Great chips and salsa and excellent friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you don't want to read the whole review, I'll sum it up in one sentence -- Via Delosantos only uses yellow cheese.  I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.  Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.  It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.  The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.  This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.  The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.  I'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Great place! This is Arizona style Mexican food, not the snooty $12 taco plate stuff.  Atmosphere isn't fancy, it's Authentic."}
{"text":"I went here last week. This place seemed okay, I have never heard of it before, but my friend suggested it and really liked it before. So, we went there, and the staff was really nice but everyone was quite 'blah'.  Not too happy to be working or something? (Who really is, right?!). So not too many smiles coming your way if you go here. Anyway, the salsa/chips that they bring to the table were pretty good. They have hot and mild on the table and I didn't know which was which (usually I can tell), but found out right away! If you like hot salsa, then you'd like the one on the table!  But def. good flavors.   For dinner, I ordered the fish tacos (Tacos de carnitas is what the item was on the menu) . And the flavors were quite good and good portions I must say. However, the fish was overcooked so it was a little rubbery.   **Just a note, they do have a Vegetarian menu which I found very interesting at a Mexican restaurant. So there is food for everyone!  Overall I had a good experience here, the prices are a bit high to me, but that was really the only downfall. (And that I wish some of the staff would of been more personable.) But no matter, the company I was with,  was entertainment enough! :o)"}
{"text":"Most definitely a whole in the wall place, the food is very good.  On a recent visit the waiter suggested the cabbage and corn enchilada. Since then I've ordered them, they are very tasty.  The cheese crisps are a good appetizer to get you started as well, great variety."}
{"text":"Was there recently catching up with a good friend. Small, family owned non-chain place. Good food. They have a lot of vegetarian items on the menu for those who are vegetarian. Great staff."}
{"text":"I think you can tell a lot about Mexican restaurant from they're enchiladas sauce.  And the beef enchiladas were delightful!  The sauce has a little hint of heat, that makes you come back for more.  You can't go wrong with over 150 different types of tequila!  Wish it was closer to my place.   If you ever in the area def have to stop by"}
{"text":"I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking \" Dammit Arik B was right\"!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time ever last week.....  And I loved the food!  Delicious.  I shall return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the green chile. I have never really had good service here, but the good food makes me not mind as much. I had lunch there today. The food was served less than 5 minutes after I ordered it. The food was hot and fresh. However, the server never asked how the food was or asked if I would like a drink refill. If you are looking for good food then I recommend it. If you are all about great service then skip it."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have stayed away from this restaurant for some time, because my last few visits would rank at around a 2.  This most recent visit was closer to a 3.5 stars, but I'm giving them the 4 because of the vast improvement over my prior visits.  A couple weeks ago I found myself \"stuck\" going here.  I hoped for the best and was a good sport.  We ordered a cheese crisp and shredded taco appetizers.  A basic House Margarita, frozen, was good.  The cheese crisp was super crispy and the perfect balance of bubbly hot cheese to tortilla ratio.  The tacos were the best I have ever had at this location.  Service was a little slow, but competent.  So, I can say that I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by this most recent visit.  More cautious optimism, less avoidance, for now."}
{"text":"The best Sonoran Mexican food I've ever had--even in Mexico. An absolute institution. The best chips, the best salsa, delicious true Mexican cocktails.  Definitive. There's no other way to put it. Dream-worthy."}
{"text":"Very casual setting.  Close to divvy.  Friendly service.  Tomato sauce based salsa.  Not really authentic.  Too tomatoey.  Chicken quesadillas and mini tacos were good but nothing special."}
{"text":"great food and service we love to go all the time. gets crowded and sometimes parking is hard to find. but its worth it."}
{"text":"My fiance's favorite meal of our vacation. This was recommended to us by the front desk staff at our resort and turned out to be less than a 5 minute drive away. The chips are a little thinner than we are used to but the salsa made up for it and then some! Definitely worth check out if in the area."}
{"text":"Huge menu, gluten free friendly, vegetarian friendly, best chips, nice and thin. They have salsa and hot sauce, both have great flavor. Huge selection of top choice tequilas.  Great service, fast and very pleasant.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation...did not disappoint. Great atmosphere, food is excellent and their salsa is on point. Definitely some of the best Mexican I've had in the Valley."}
{"text":"I drive by this place quite often not even realizing it was here. Surprise surprise what a little gem we found! I went big on my 1st visit and I'm glad I did. Not everyone cam mask a chili relleno the way I like them. Well well well they did Definitly be back for more chips and salsa probably the best in a very long time other then my besties moms salsa Can't wait to try a happy hour out specially in the patio when its cooler. Glad I found this place and decided to stop. Service was great our server very nice and the rest of the staff as well. Thanks for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Another great experience  great bar happy patrons lots of regulars  to much food yo eat drinks a flowing truly a gem glad not too many peoe know about it.   If your up on central north of senator  Mcains .  Check this place out"}
{"text":"So the salsa has way to much black pepper.. the service isn't always friendly.. but the list of tequila's is TDF! I generally frequent this place for a cheap yummy lunch, green chile Navajo taco, and is super close to work.. nothing like tying one on at lunch time to make the rest of the afternoon smooth by.. just kidding, I never do that!"}
{"text":"It is just North of Dunlap and Central on the West hand side.  But, it was a nice mexican restaraunt with very YUMMY chicken enchiladas for great prices. Lately I haven't been liking the red sauce that comes on enchiladas, but this red sauce was killer!! And served with the traditional rice and beans. I love when you get those great big plates for nothing of a price, and the free appetizer of chips and salsa (they gave two different salsas!). Also, they had house margaritas, small one was only $1.99, not even on happy hour!! they weren't holden back on the tequila either! Service was very nice. Highly recommend for some good cheap margaritas and food with flava!!"}
{"text":"One Liner: Good for lots of margaritas and food  Food: (scale of 0-4) 2.2 You get a lot of food for very little damage. The salsa is awesome. The hot salsa taste a bit more chemical and it isn't really hotter either. Whatever you order, you get plenty of food. This is a great place for getting full while getting some margaritas.   Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.7  Service 0.2:   Decor 0.1:   Speed 0.1:   Dessert 0.1:   Prices 0.2:   My score for this experience is 2.9 stars."}
{"text":"The Via Mexigo was an excellent sampler, the staff friendly and attentive. Two salsa dips, crisp chips."}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall mexican food.  The shredded beef taco was solid, but they put it on top of my beans, which makes it soggy.  Good margaritas too.  The cheese enchilada was perfect."}
{"text":"Best in town I've been going here for 10 years...  pollo fundido death row meal ..."}
{"text":"Okay yes this place is not super trendy and yes the chips come on a plastic bowl but the food has been consistently good since I have been coming here for the past three years. When I want good, cheap authentic Arizona Mexican food I come here.  I am not sure why people are coming here expecting a high class joint.  It is in Sunnyslope and you park in a parking lot that you are not sure your car will be there when you return.  I promise it is still worth it.  The margaritas are good for what you pay and the pollo fundido is delish."}
{"text":"Incredible tequila selection! The food is consistantly very very good. Service is always attentive. Both the mild and hot salsa are two of my favorites but I'd suggest asking for some of the freshly made pico de gallo.  This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The shredded beef tacos are very good but the machaca are even better."}
{"text":"Very good chips and salsa and great green chili! And believe it or not, one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever ate! And oh those margaritas... what a bang for only 3 bucks!  It's very old and eclectic looking, and the service can be a bit spotty on very busy nights, but we love this place."}
{"text":"it was really bad.   Walked in and smelt like sewer. Seriously I can't believe the place remains open. I am going to contact the health department.   The restaurant is in very bad condition. The whole place looks run down.  Food was Filabertos level.   Do not go here. One things for sure is people dont know real good food. Those reviews and reviewers are crazy."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Good authentic Mexican food. Very affordable and the service was really good. The place is old but charming like a real authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been bringing friends to this neighborhood find for years and only today learned it's not Via de los Santos! It's named after the owner, Delosantos.   I went to Sunnyslope High School, so this is my old 'hood.   If you like a place that's cozy and funky with nice staff and tasty Mexican food, go here! I asked our server whether she recommended the chicken or the shrimp fajitas, since I love veggies and chicken or fish. She recommended the shrimp. ($11.95)  Wow! I ate the whole plate...which should have been enough to have a small plate for leftovers. But no-oh! It was too addicting to not devour it fresh off the grill. Whatever they spread on the shrimp? I was in heaven.  The chips are decent. The chunky salsa was tasty. When I asked for a spicy bloody merry with a garden, they did put in two olives (no celery) and the server came back to ask if it was spicy enough. Nice, right?  It was yummy.   They have $3 house margaritas all day, every day. And 200 tequilas, which I can't report on because tequila gives me a hangover before I go to bed. And I hate hangovers. Just like you.  It's located just north of Dunlap on Central, on the west side. If you can't park in the lot, park on the side street.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best home made Mexican food in Phoenix great service fresh ingredients super nice server. Delish!"}
{"text":"Huevos rancheros! New favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't give ratings this low very often but after looking forward to the evidently over-hyped Via Delosantos I was as thoroughly disappointed as can be. Our server was kind and attentive, and the crispy cheese app was actually quite good, but that's where the praise ends. And the demerits were enough for their rating to drop from what would have been a 3 (if the food just wasn't for me) down to a 1.  The beef fajitas were not plentiful but that's okay because they were overcooked and utterly tasteless. But that wasn't the worst of it. The shrimp enchiladas were disgusting. Usually (but not exclusively) shrimp or seafood enchiladas are covered with a cream sauce. These were covered in a tomato sauce that was closer to the taste of a tomato paste however. A poor chef's choice perhaps, but also poorly implemented. But even then it got worse.  The shrimp were either of an extremely low grade or not cleaned well, or both. Each bite seemed to introduce more and more grit making the dish completely inedible. We didn't complain and paid the full bill but left most of our meal on the table and left unsatisfied, disappointed, and with absolutely no desire to ever come back.  Via Delosantos came highly recommended and hyped even more. This was reaffirmed by the high ratings. Well maybe all that comes from the experience of an earlier time, but don't believe the hype. To even call this place ordinary is giving it far too much credit. There are SO many MUCH better places in the area that even \"average\" should have a tough time... much less \"well below average.\""}
{"text":"Parking lot always full. Great Yelp Reviews. WOW! Great food. Friendly service. Authentic charm. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Overall I like their food. Lots of chips and great salsa..both hot and mild. always free and as many as you can eat. Beer is cold cold cold. staffer pleasant and prompt. great with drink refills. All items are delicious. Sopapillas...really good.  Best mexican food around. Pleasant , casual atmosphere and not expensive. good value for the money."}
{"text":"When it comes to finding an extensive selection of 100% Agave tequila, in Sunnyslope, look no further."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Tequila selection is the most ive ever seen, probably my favorite Mexican restaurant, sit in the bar if you can-small but fun."}
{"text":"Food is good really enjoy their hot salsa. Sure could do without the heavy perfume one of the waitresses was wearing. The smell competed with the taste of the food. Also gave me a head ache."}
{"text":"Green chile burrito is the best. Via De Los Santos has the best chips and hot sauce in town. I am no fan of cilantro so I do not eat the salsa, but my family loves the salsa."}
{"text":"Who can complain when you're dealing with 99 cent margaritas? After I order a couple and a large fried quesadilla, I'll even forget that I recently read Via Delosantos received the worst report in 2004 for their numerous major Health Department violations!"}
{"text":"love via delosantos - good friend GREAT customer service!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places. Really I can't believe that they expect people to pay for this stuf they serve as food. We ordered fajitas & were served scraps of meat. Also, for a Mexican food restaurant to serve guacamole from a package is a bad sign."}
{"text":"Oh no!  Me thinks not.  Food is bland and lacks creativity.  Service is also not attentive either.  I received a soda refill with a hole in the glass which I discovered a stream forming on the table.  The waitress didn't understand leaking glass so I had to explain HOLE in glass.  I received another soda but the stream was still alive and well.  She did not come back to soak up the spill.   Our plates were surfing Baja style.  Ten minutes later,  gut bomb has been set off.  They may have an extensive menu, but I would pass even on the table of contents."}
{"text":"After Don Jose's on 36th Street and Thomas closed, I spent a year at home in tears, venturing out to eat mexican food very rarely, and then a friend of a friend turned me on to Via.  This has been my saving grace, and the variety on their menu makes it easy to take even the pickiest of my friends.  Being a fairly routine person myself, I regularly enjoy their mexican pizza, but have also tried and enjoyed their chalupas, tostadas, burros and enchiladas.  It's difficult to get a seat in here on a Friday or Saturday night, but I'm usually there in the early evening on a Friday for a much needed (and very affordable!) margarita!  Definitely a great little hole on the wall place!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Co-winner of the best chips and salsa in the valley. Best house Margs at $3.00 each...top that one! The Mexican pasta with wide egg noodles topped with their green chili is addictive and you won't find that one anywhere else. Its always busy and hectic but somehow they find you a table quickly. They also tend to remember you on return visits which means they don't have turnover of their help like the chain places do.  Highly recommended and would give it the coveted fifth star if they would someday do a little remodeling as it is \"rustic\" and then some if you get my drift."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had anywhere. They deep fat fry the taco shell with the shredded beef in it so it's all cooked up together. Then the lettuce, tomato, & cheese on it are perfect.  Order the tacos!  The rest is really good. Everything 4 or 5 stars.  The beer selection sucks. They have a good choice of Mexican beer but no American microbrews. The margaritas are a 4.  Did I mention the tacos?"}
{"text":"Dinners were good, but chips where stale!  Tables are way to close together, (we were shoved in a corner with 4 people). We did not get refills until we were done with our dinner...  It was just not a Pleasant evening. We have not eaten here for years, and I don't see us returning..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It reminds me of my trips to Nogales as a kid with family.  The plates are always hot, the food flavorful and the staff consistently friendly and attentive.  Great chips and salsa and they keep them coming.  The only recommendation I have is to double check your bill.  My uncle mentioned that he regularly gets overcharged here so we started paying attention to our receipt.  Sure enough, the last three times we have been here we were charged more that we should have."}
{"text":"A toss up between here and El Bravo, both about the same distance from Point A. (my house).  Delosantos wins because of the real margarita's.  My favorite entree item is the red beef burro, some of the best in town.  Excellent tequila selection.  What most Americans would consider \"authentic\" Mexican (Sonoran) food.  It is kinda ratty, and any restaurant that has been around this long might have trouble keeping their health dep't rating.  Edit:  After another year (and 5+ trips back), I have to give it another star, and amend my comment about the cleanliness of the restaurant.  First, the red beef chili burro is _still_ one of the best in town, I've been using that as my barometer for other Mexican restaurants, and this place still wins.  Also, they've cleaned up the dining area quite a bit, so I take back the 'ratty' comment.  Lot less dusty then I remember it, and maybe a fresh coat of paint, who knows.   Still, the prices are good, and the food is great.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The largest tequila selection in Phoenix puts this place high on the list of my favorite North Central Phoenix mexican food spots. It is awesomely tacky, and the crowd at Via Delosantos is always ready to have a good time. Of course, it's hard NOT to have a good time when they have great margaritas for 99 cents at Happy Hour.   The food is good, the service is good, but the drinks and drink specials are (*) great. (expletive deleted)"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing Place to come and enjoy your evening  with friends and family.. The service was awesome.. Food on point .."}
{"text":"Best salsa anywhere - great chips - perfect service! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"As a newbie to Mexican food this is a nice transition from taco bell.  The rice and beans are savory and the enchiladas are guaranteed to lull you to sleep soon afterwards.  Fresh salsa,  cheap drinks.  Friendly  and colorful environment.  They were  patient as I inquired about the variety and my general ignorance and misprouncation of the food.   I shall return!"}
{"text":"I'm going to miss this place!! Amazing workers and food is delicious! My all time favorite Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is indeed once of the classic Phoenix Mexican restaurants. I've been here dozens of times, and love bringing out-of-towners. The menu is vast!   We like the veggie section of the menu. They do not use lard, so I usually get a vegan bean burrito (no cheese). The tortilla is excellent! My husband likes the spinach enchilada. The chips are fresh and warm, and the salsas are above average.   The interior of the restaurant is perfect on a scorcher of a Phoenix afternoon. It's almost cave-like, especially if you are in a booth. The service has always been prompt and friendly.    While I appreciate the veggie section of the menu, maybe next time they print it they could mark what items are vegan, or could be made vegan? Other than that, this place is great!"}
{"text":"They had me at fresh tortilla chips.  SO.  AMAZING. I personally love the flautas and guac, but everything is amazing (and that's no exaggeration).    Beware: this isn't a hip, trendy place to take that one friend that can't get past the orange booths; this is where the foodies go."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was nice.  Margarita was mediocre.  This off the beaten path little place was great for my out of town group.  I would suggest the shredded beef chimichanga.  It was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Lunch here yesterday. Service was terrible and my friend was served her lunch without utensils. She asked for utensils and the waitress left and did not return. I got up and asked the hostess and she gave me attitude. I didn't get what I ordered but ate it anyway. The food was good. The fly buzzing our table was not. I'll never go here again. Bad service."}
{"text":"I needed a margarita... yes, needed.  I needed it immediately and I needed it icy cold.  Closest watering hole was a mile away.... and it was open.  Via DeLosantos has a list of tequilas that is 2 pages long... you can get a terrific margarita and a good dinner for 2 for under $30.    After our emergency first aid kit of frozen margaritas and margaritas on the rocks, we relaxed our way through 2 bowls of salsa, chips and guacamole... then came the tacos and chili rellenos....  The atmosphere is a little of Rocky Point meets garage-Quonset hut shabby Mexican craft chic.  It is ultra casual, but in my opinion, NOT seedy.  It's colorful, and loud, and comfortable with liberal use of paint.  It was the perfect way to wind down after a long day.... I think I'll have one more.  Did i mention that the house Margaritas are $.99.  Good too"}
{"text":"Jimmy is my favorite bartender. This is where you come to find out what is going on in the neighborhood. The beans r the best in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here sense I was a baby. It is where I learned how to behave and not piss off others as a child.   This place is an awesome gem off north central in a neighborhood that has been described as the hood. The food is delicious, the decor is authentic and hasn't changed for years.   I'm a BIG salsa lover. I need my own bowl refilled through out my meal. Their salsa is one of the best I've had in Arizona.   You really can't go wrong ordering anything. The only thing I'm not a fan of if their premade margarita (because I don't like them sweet).  They don't have a website, they are old school just the way I like em.   I posted pics of the menu because- I can.   Eat up, so worth it!"}
{"text":"No good service. And good was not good and house margarita was nasty. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Awesome, best Mexican food I've had. Asked the hotel Consiair for the best local Mexican restaurant and they recommend this hidden gem. Don't be fooled by the exterior because the staff and food are primo."}
{"text":"If you are in a rush and need to get in eat and get out, Via is not the place for you!  I've been here 6-7 times and every single time the service has been so slow!  I'm pretty understanding when you are short staff'd and all, because one time it was pretty apparent no one showed up for work that day. Seriously, I saw our waitress once in 10-15 minutes, and it was during the day, so there were not that many people there.  It was a little embarassing because I'm pretty sure I suggested the place, to a couple of people who had never been.  That was just one time though, but I will admit, they are pretty slow all the time. I can handle the service so anytime I'm in the area, this is the first place I suggest, because I really do like the food though. Its similar to the mexican food I grew up on at La Palma, which is now a CSV, so any mexican place I eat at is compared to LaPalma.  I miss you LaPalma, especially your take home Hot Sauce mix!  I've only been here once at \"diner\" time, and it was packed!!!  I usually go for some lunch, to sit in the tiny bar area with my corona, lite of course.  I need to go back on a cool day to sit on the patio and try the margarita's enjoying the fact that I will not have a waitress/waiter bugging me all the time."}
{"text":"I personally think this little place is great .. I love the old school hole in the wall Mexican joints ! If your looking for fine dinning or expecting fine dinning then move along .. but if you want good dive authentic Mexican food , the kind where everything is touching and melts together then this IS your place to stop and try ! And did I mention the margaritas are only $3.50 ?! Kinda syrupy sweet , but aren't all house margaritas anywhere you go ?"}
{"text":"Pretty typical sit down mexican cuisine. It isn't super authentic, but it is better than those other commercialized places like Azteca.  I would put this on fighting ground with that Irish Mexican place on 16th st. (i forget it's name). definitely would prefer this place. it is more hole in the wall.  Food has HUGE servings. I walked away happy.  The green chili quesadilla isn't bad (not the best i've had though)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't have anything really good or bad abt this place. It was just ok. Although the chips were great. The food was pretty basic. I didn't like that I was served a margarita in a non margarita glass"}
{"text":"I adore this place. I've been here several times. Here are my tips. The margaritas are pretty good. They are just mix, but they are cheap. XX Amber is on tap, which is great. As far as eats, I love: the beef tacos, enchiladas of any kind (their sauce is great), and the pollo fundido. BUT! My two go to dishes are the the beef machacha (sp?) with eggs and red chili beef tamales. Both are amazing. The tamales are heaven. Creamy in texture, beef falling apart, and super moist. I like them with enchilada sauce too. They don't need it, but it is YUMMY. Lastly, it's a kitchy gringo place but still fun. A great spot in Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"I've been to Via about three times now, and I have had nothing but a great experience! The quaIity of the ChiIe ReIIeno bIows the chain Mexican food restaurants out of the water! The portion to price ratio is fantastic. They offer fresh, thin, corn tortiIIa chips with IittIe bowIs of yummy hot sauce and miId saIsa. I wish those bowIs were deeper, because my husband and I are at the bottom before you can say crazy quesadiIIa ten times fast.  The house margaritas are aIways $2.99 and made with decent tequiIa. Not to mention they make the mix fresh each morning, and it's deIivered POOF! right after it's ordered.  The onIy thing I think couId bring Via up to five stars, wouId be the decor( it's Iike sensory overIoad waIking in there at first), but, it's charming in its own right. :)  I wouId definiteIy recommend this to anyone who Ioves a reIiabIe, authentic, Mexican meaI from time to time( or in my case, every other day)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the whole world! Their food is authentic, good quality as well as delicious!  They have very good customer service. The servers are friendly, attentive and consistent.  Their margaritas are amazing for drinks. Everything that they offer is good. I've never tried something here that I didn't like.  It's amazing food for an inexpensive price. It's a place that will leave your taste buds happy."}
{"text":"I cannot say one bad thing about this place. Just get there early because the wait can be ridiculous. I love everything on the menu, but my family and I share the via mexico dinner most of the time. We share dinners because the chips and salsa are amazing!! yum-o."}
{"text":"So I've been to Via Delosantos a number of time since I moved to uptown Phoenix six years ago. Finally, I'm getting around to writing a review. If you want classic Phoenix-Sonoran Mexican food and great service in Uptown, this is where to go. Service is quick and happy. Chips are thin and crisp; the salsas, regular and hot, are tasty. The menu is extensive and the food is delicious. I can't imagine something that you would want in a Mexican restaurant that isn't on their menu, including vegetarian options, egg dishes and their own unique pasta dishes. Walk into the dining room and look around. You'll see that this is the place that locals and especially Mexican-heritage families go. 'Nuff said (except note that this is for the dining room; the bar room experience can be different as in a different kind of local crowd that's not everyone's cup of te...quila.)"}
{"text":"Does anyone else think chips and salsa are part of the foodgroups? I do! Yes this is a hole in the wall, yes it is in a scetchyer \"hood\"  but it will be worth your time.  Margarita's...check out their 2.99 deals or just for the heck of it get a piture and share with some friends.  The atmosphere can be loud (decor and patrons alike), but for this reason, it is a good place to bring kids because no one cares when your kids are as loud as your adults. On to the food....Chimis are great, my husband always gets the heart attack style (this is not the name) chimi with white cheese sauce. There are a lot of vegitarian options here for all you non carnivores. If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid, then Via Delosantos is your place."}
{"text":"This is totally the coyote ugly* of Mexican restaurants.   *Not the movie or the bar, you ass. I'm talking about the phenomenon. If you figure this out, you can figure out why I give it 3 heated and questionable stars. But, yeah, what everyone else has said, basically."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for something different and hoping this would be greatness. Unfortunately, this wasn't it. The experience was \"okay\". The food was okay.  Neither one of us was a huge fan of the salsa or chips, ( we were hoping to get closer to the salsa my fiance's mother makes since one of the reviews says \"Not white people mexican food\" however according to my fiance the food we had was a mere okay, and didn't live up to that.  The service was a bit slow on drinks and we barely saw our waitress. It was terribly busy so that may have accounted for the service...although the food was out ridiculously quick!  It wasn't anything I got really hyped about, not being big drinkers I don't think we fit the primary people that this place appeals to (those who love tequila).  So if you're into drinking, this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila, if not, you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices. By the way, if you're going around dinner time...you're probably going to have a little trouble finding parking because they are packed!"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood Mexican! Margaritas for days! Love the pollo fundido and really anything on the menu. Service is always fast and friendly. Won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in Phoenix!  I'm partial to Mexican food in Tucson but was wowed tonight!  Eddie is awesome and I can't wait to bring my whole family here!  So good!  Thank you for the great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with the hubby. It was recommended by several people. It is definitely an old school place. Older crowd too. The food was amazing. I had the muchaca chimichanga and it was the best one I think I ever had. Very flavorful. And the prices were so good! We are absolutely going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant a friend brought me in and I never knew this place was there I've been there 5 times in the last 2 weeks yes I have a problem! Joanie at the front is truly amazing and the servers are on top of their game. The food is so amazing and addicting.  I can't wait to try one of their famous margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years... probably my favorite North Central Phoenix Mexican 'comfort food' restaurant.  Great homey decor, HUGE tequila selection, good chips and salsa.  Delicious enchiladas, tortas, combos.  Good margueritas and good Mexican beer selection.   Recommended."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix this week on business and had my favorite soup.  It is still YUMMY!!!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food great service excellent Tequila selection.  Check out the red Chimichanga"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! Our waitress Grace was awesome. We had a party of 10 our service was flawless."}
{"text":"Far and away my favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ.  Food is always fast and great, carne asada is spot on and everything is delicious.  Always leave full, happy, and when off the clock with a little buzz on.  Great place to bike to as it is close to the canal path through central Phoenix.  Good for Breakfast lunch and dinner.  I don't live close but it is worth the drive.   Cool patio when the weather is nice.  Middle of Sunnyslope just south of Hatcher, if that is too much of an issue for you well than thank you for leaving a seat open."}
{"text":"My uncle and my other uncle took me here for like a birthday slash lunch thing, and it's a great Mexican food place I recommend it to anyone if you're around this area. And it's really really good it so I think it's a hole in the wall if you can find it go there it's awesome place I recommended God bless."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time with a group of friends. Neat place with a good ambiance vibe. Outdoor seating available as well as take out. Service was excellent and food was very good. Overall great experience. Parking could be better."}
{"text":"I'm seriously confused by all the positive reviews. My husband's co-worker said this place was good. We've driven by many times and it's always crowded so we gave it a try last night.  The interior is nothing to write home about. Maybe the divey look is what they are going for so I won't knock it. Surprisingly, they have a decent vegetarian menu. I ordered the veggie fajitas, no rice and no beans. I'm used to the fajita being served in a mini skillet that's sizzling hot with goodness......NOPE. What I received was a hot plate with diced vegetables, a side of corn tortillas and a side of guac & sour cream. The veggie mixture consisted primarily of tomatoes and carrots. Where are the bell peppers??? The veggies were not marinated or seasoned so I relied heavily on the salsa to punch up the flavor. My husband got the carne asada plate which came with rice & beans and tons of cheese melted on top. He too relied heavily on the salsa. I will say that the wait staff was friendly.  If you want Americanized Mexican food then go here. If you want an extensive tequila selection then go here. I don't care for either therefore I will not be back."}
{"text":"Holy cow what a great hole in the wall. We read the reviews and needed a pollo fundido fix since we had not been in Phoenix for a few years. It was a 25 minute drive but totally worth it. She had the pollo fundido and i had Via Mexico. Both great. The special extra hot salsa isnt really hot but has this smokey grilled  chile goodness that we couldnt place but want to duplicate. 3 margaritas on the rocks were $8.97. We are Austin foodies so we have no shortage of good tex mex but this place is special and a do over for us. Oh yes...fantastic service."}
{"text":"Really slow service, people too busy talking and not enough serving. I had to leave and didn't even order cause they were so slow and unaccommodating"}
{"text":"Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!  Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!  I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!  Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew...."}
{"text":"Via Delosantos is one of the few places in Phoenix that a vegetarian can get a good Mexican meal.  Neither the beans or rice are cooked in lard, which is hard to find in this town.  The chips and salsa are premium, just watch out for the fried potatoes and such - very greasy.  Thanks to Philip's illuminating review, I hadn't heard about their health code violations.  It's something I'll keep an eye on in the future though... if they take another dive like they did in 2004 I'll keep my distance for a while."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on the recommendation of one of my coworkers about 4 months ago, and it has become my definite favorite hole in the wall mexican place, with very flavorful, smooth, red enchilada sauce and very fresh, large portions.  This is a lunch stop for me (you won't catch me in this area at night...), there is a beef quesadilla that is excellent or the mucho macho burrito will definitely fill you up, both for under $7.  The service can be brusque, but to be honest for this type of place I really don't want to interact with the servers any more than to give my order and ask for more of their salsa..."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch on a Sunday for the first time and the place was packed.  The food was delicious and reminded me a bit of Tex-Mex (my favorite Mexican food).  There are plenty of options for vegetarians on the menu so I appreciated that I didnt have to say I would like something and then ask to have it without the meat.  The restaurant is a bit cluttered and run down but that adds to the charm for me.  All in all, Im a new fan and definitely going to become a regular."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, the food is almost 5 stars. The decor and dish ware are lacking but it's a hole in the wall what do you expect?? First visit was two weeks ago and I took the family back twice since. It's definitely worth checking out...oh yeah, $3 house Margaritas and $4 small pitchers of beer-----good times"}
{"text":"The best corn and cabbage enchiladas (with white sauce) in the World; been coming here for twenty years."}
{"text":"Good food but extremely slow service.  Went in with a large group and everyone said their meal was good, but it took more than 30 minutes to get the check even after the plates were cleared.  I'd recommend this place as long as you aren't trying to squeeze in a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Bottom line, Sonoran style Mexican.  The first thing to contend with here is the old school menu. Too many items I have had too many times. I have a tequila and a beer, chip and salsa. The tequila list is long and looks good. My pour is heavy but I didn't like my choice I went cheap. Had a double cross lager, a good beer. The salsas were great.  I decide to try the spinach, asparagus enchilada, rice and beans. Now I'm very happy  that my ingredients are very good. I enjoyed the meal. Ate it all. I would love to see many more recipes from other parts of Mexico, especially tacos.  It's a new year, out with the old in with the new."}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  99c ritas, good food, good atmosphere.....  My family had been going there for years...  But... over the past 3 years or so the service has gone down hill fast!  On our final visit to Via's we met our waitress when she took our order and.. then never saw her again.  I had to get us more forks, ask for more Chips and Salsa, go to the bar for more drinks ect..  Then we the bill came there was a 20% gratuity added!!!  We asked if we could have the 20% taken off so we could tip what we thought the service deserved.... that's when we saw the waitress for the second time of the night... She said that she could not change the ticket since there were 6 or more people on the check...  At this point we were very upset and took our check to the front to pay and never come back.  As we were paying and complaining to the manager the waitress takes cash out of the drawer and hands it out to us and says  \"just keep the tip if you didn't like my service\" in a rude attitude way.    We told the manager to keep the tip since we would never be back to their establishment again.   Our family is very easy to please and we understand that restaurants get busy and service can not be 100% all the time.  But we do expect basic courtesy even if its the busiest night of the year.  I do miss the old Via's"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix, everything was perfect. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't think we've been in the restaurant but once(I'm sure the food is the same) but most Sundays (after church Mom!) You'll find my little love and I in the cozy cantina(on the right as ya walk in) if ya go say hi to Rick, he's our favorite barkeep and there's not a drink he can't make better that it's original recipe.. and please don't go Sundays between 1130 and 100pm because the FREE green chili, red chile,and beans w/cheese is for us, they keep.telling us to share with other.customers but we don't want too. Don't forget to tip what ya would have spent for lunch cause if your lucky ya might get a shot of one of 50+ tequilas avail there. I suggest the almond and chase with marishino cherry. Damn that's good food and good people.......no where else I'd rather spend my money and a little time. Cheers."}
{"text":"I wrote a big, long review yet it did not get saved!  In summary, great place yet the food is very similar to other Mexican restaurants in the valley (Valle Luna comes to mind). Great staff and they make sure you get your fill of chips/salsa. Will come back and looks like a great place to catch a football game (American or soccer)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. I did not see any roaches like Arik claimed. I did however find the place to be old and somewhat run down. What do you expect from an old family style Sonoran Mexican restaurant. Their salsa is tasty, and the burrito enchilada style was great. I'd go back but It's not on my short list. It's just okay."}
{"text":"This is one of the best old-school Mexican restaurants. Everything about the place is outstanding. Great sauce, cheese, beans, rice, salsa, enchiladas, tacos and the huge selection of Tequila. This is a legend of a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant because the food is home style Mexican and the atmosphere is fun and what I expect with great Mexican food.  Absolutely love the lady bartender on Friday nights.  Her margaritas are second to none.  There is usually a wait but it is truly worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Charning atmosphere. Friendly staff. Cute bar attached. The chips are homemade-as is most everything else. Great prices, great portions. Well done margaritas and plenty of veggie options. Please note they do *not* use lard AND they are open 7 days a week. Some searches will tell you otherwise. Chalupas and Chili Rellenios are recommended!"}
{"text":"The waiter was very helpful and suggested the Pollo Fundido.  Got it and it was amazing!  The chips and salsa were also very good and a few Mexican beers helped things go down smoothly."}
{"text":"This is my 5th visit,  the food is great and seems to get better with each visit.  Does not disappoint.   Love their chilaquiles be sure to add a fried egg.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for approximately 20 years, and considered it one of the top 5 Mexican food restaurants in the valley.  No more.  When I went tonight the first thing I noticed that 20-25% of the menu was blacked out, particularly the part about the flavorings in the dishes served. And it was true, the food is now bland. And the service is now atrocious.  My friend,  who also goes there with me frequently,  also agreed the restaurant has taken a turn for the worse. When I questioned our server she replied, \"We are going through changes. \" Definitely will never return or recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"So. Fabulouso! I'm cereal. From the chips and salsa to the green chile cheese crisp to the endless parade of margaritas and shots of tequila right down to my bean tostada, out of this world tamale and cheesey cheese ensheelotta....  Well...  If it were legal to marry a restaurant, I would seriously consider courting Via Delosantos. But it's not. Can't marry a goat. Can't marry a gay. Can't marry a restaurant.   We had attentive and friendly service and was informed because it was 9:30 it was last call. So we ordered up! Went with my besties who are regulars so I feel as though we were extra pampered.   Extremely generous tequila list. Comfortable and cozy decor. Clean restrooms. Great company and delicious food.  As Arnold says \"I'll be backito!\""}
{"text":"We ate dinner here with our three kids on a Friday night. We were told the wait was 15-20 minutes, but it ended up being 45. The bathrooms and the restaurant were dirty. The food was ok. Both my wife and I ordered fajitas - one chicken and one beef. The protein on both was tough and overcooked. The corn tortillas that came with the dish were OK, but they stuck together in the wax paper roll they were served in. So when you pulled them out they had holes in them...rendering them useless other than eating them plain.  They do have a nice selection of tequilas. I had a Don Julio margarita, but it was too syrupy for my taste."}
{"text":"First let me say I have been a customer for 20 years so it is with a broken heart that I give 2 star review.   And the only reason I did is because my server and the hostess were so nice.   I was in a party off 5 and 2 of the meals were not fresh.   My mom ordered a chimichanga and it came to the table soft,  not hot and crispy.   She dealt with it.   My best friend ordered the carnitas.  The plate and food were cold - beans, rice, meat - everything.   We were seated outside where the service is always slow (we expected it,  that always happens).  My best friend went to the hostess table to address the issue quickly and waited for 10 minutes before the waiter or manager would address her concern.   Then the manager - Eddie - copped an attitude and said she should have told her waiter, why was she telling the manager - at this point she still hasn't seen our waiter.  When she tried to explain she would have told our waiter if she had seen him at any point during her wait.   The manager then demanded to know what she wanted,  a replacement meal,  a comped meal or what.   He was so pissy she was nervous about getting \"secret sauce\" of she had a replacement plate, not to mention all of us were done eating by this point.   Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Via Delosantos, and not only because it's about a 5 minute walk from my house. Their house margaritas are only $3. Are they the best margaritas you'll ever have? Probably not. They're a little sweet and made with a mix. But will they get you drunk? You're damn right they will. And for the price, you really can't beat that. They make it easy for you if you want to turn any of their 50+ nicer tequilas into a margarita: just add $2 to the shot price.   As for the food, I've never been disappointed. Some things are better than others though. Their Pollo Fundido is truly the best in town. I've never had a better tamale, and they have red and green sauces. I believe the red is vegetarian friendly, so when I had my veggie friend visiting, she was happy to have an authentic tamale to try. My husband and I mixed it up last time we went and split the Super Mexican Pizza, which was surprisingly good. It was on a huge tortilla and had machaca beef, tomatoes, green onions and black olives. Ask for a side of sour cream and you'll be in heaven. One mexican pizza, a margartia, a Dos Equis and tip= $25. Not bad for a night out for two, and we even had a few pieces leftover. Personally, I didn't care for their guacamole. It just seemed like mashed up avocado to me, no especially interesting additions, so that's the one thing I'd steer clear of.   I don't personally know what \"real\" Mexican food is...I've never been to Mexico. All I know is my husband and I have been told by several people from Mexico that we're lucky to live by one of the best authentic places in Phoenix. So take that as you will.  The place is a little run down, but to me that's part of the charm. I love sitting in the little back room, it has a more personal feel. They get pretty busy around dinnertime on the weekends, but the wait never seems to be more than 10-15 minutes. Fair warning: They close at 9:30, even on Saturdays, which is pretty annoying. I thought the hours listed here couldn't possibly be right, but I called and confirmed."}
{"text":"IMHO,  Mexican food is an entire food group on it's own.  The best is here.  Agreed the chips and salsa are a staple in themselves. The Chimi's, Tacos, Enchiladas, all are great.  They are a long established business of 30 years.   Personally I just don't bother going anywhere else."}
{"text":"OK, i love this place.. i really do, but as you will read from other Yelpers, its not always the best.. i kid you not, when i first moved to Phoenix i noticed this building,and i have lived in phoenix for 21 years.. finally i went in, and i love it. then i turned 21 and i really loved it!! the margaritas are fabulous!!! the salsa is BOMB! the food,its good, the service..S L O W, but friendly and helpful. but really give this place a try, its good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Via was about five years ago shortly after we moved into the \"Slope\" aka Sunnyslope.  Back then the waiters were surly, the food was good, and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus.  About the only thing that's changed in that time is the margaritas are now $2.99, but you'll still get the same great food and the same surly service.  Well, that's not entirely true of the service.  It's been my experience that if it's a slow night and you have a female server, then your service will be top notch.  If it's busy or you happen to get a male server, then it can get a little frustrating.  I personally think they have the best mild salsa in town.  I always fill up on chips and salsa then feel like someone needs to roll me out the door because I'm so full after dinner.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can't go wrong there.  My favorite dish is the #3 combination, Green Chili Con Carne with rice and beans.  My only complaint is the same with every other Mexican Food restaurant in town, is the lettuce they use as a garnish on the plate.  I've said it before and I'll say it again...Heck I might even climb up \"S\" mountain and scream it from there...\"COLD LETTUCE HAS NO PLACE ON A HOT PLATE OF MEXICAN FOOD!\"  There, I feel much better now.  But seriously, you don't eat the lettuce, at least I don't, and even when I accidently do, it's hot and soggy.  Who likes that?  But I digress.  The bar is small, and always crowded.  The patio is nice if the weather is good.  Their list of tequilas is almost two pages long on their menu.  So if you're a tequila aficionado, then you should check it out.  If I had to rate Via on food alone, I'd give it four and a half stars.  If I had to rate via on service alone I'd have to give it two and a half stars only because it's spotty approximately half of the time.  So if I average them together Via would get three and half stars, but I'm going to round it up to four because the last few times, the service has been better and I really like the place."}
{"text":"Someone took me to lunch here about eight years ago and I had the Albondigas soup. Apparently, it was quite memorable! Overcast January day in Phoenix and I'm cuing up the Mexican soup memory. The place is just as hole-in-the-wall as ever and congrats to them! ... Celebrating 30 years on July 4th of this year.   I've never had a margarita here but they look legit. You'll be intimated to get a Dos Equis though. If the XX piñata doesn't pressure you, that guy who doesn't always drink beer but when he does is here in life size cut-out form. And on a poster. The salsa (hot) is a \"must-taste\" even if you don't do hot. It's got great flavor, doesn't burn your mouth but will clear your sinus. The mild is straight-away good as well.   The two chicken enchiladas with rice n beans were tasty too, though more meat wouldn't hurt (I always feel this way, really!)   Have I mentioned the Albondigas soup yet?! It's so flavorful. Two big meatballs in the medium (size) and among other veggies, carrots! Is this the only Mexican dish that contains carrots? I mean besides like home-pickled carrots n jalapeño?   Good service, good food, even if more Americanized Mexican. It's fresh and well-flavored. Haven't mentioned this part yet: reminds me of this place in Cancun - high school trip - some Mexican stranger who quickly became our tour guide & amigo took us down a narrow road and into a stucco room brimming with color and cerveza. This place reminds me of that place. Maybe not worth a drive for some, but definitely delivered for me today. Albondigas!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.   The chips and salsa were very good. So were the chicken chimichangas. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite awhile...and I like...a lot. Took some out of town guests here on Sunday night, and they loved it. We took a seat in the bar, and the bartender was on the ball. Hot chips arrived quickly along with a couple of their $2.99 margaritas! Yum! Two of us had the enchilada plate (one of us had green, the other red) and the other guy had the carnitas plate. No complaints here! Delicious! And if you are a tequila lover...there are hundreds to choose from! Really."}
{"text":"Love this place, it has become one of our go to restaurants for Mexican food. They have a huge tequila list but the $3 house margaritas are better than most and for that price I stick to those. Their chili verde is excellent, the tacos, enchiladas, beans, salsa, are all very good and the chili relleno is one of the best I have ever had. So hard to find really good ones!!  The only thing I have had that was so-so and I won't order here again (better elsewhere) is the albondigas soup. Also they give 20% all food orders to seniors on Thursdays. Wahoo!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot.  Absolutely amazing Mexican food and service. My albondigas soup was perfect and the fresh tortillas are to die for.  Green chile here is bursting with flavor  and the salsa is on point!"}
{"text":"If you want the full-on Sonoran Mexican food experience, this is your place. Everything on the menu is good.  They do the classics (chimichangas, enchiladas, tacos, etc.) just right.  Their margaritas and tequila selection are excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in town. Great food. Great service. They have happy hour specials Also lunch specials."}
{"text":"We are staying at Tapatio Cliffs and I will write my review on that place next, which believe me won't be good. As far as this restaurant, AWESOME food!! My mom ate at the restaurant 12 years ago and remembered it tasting amazing. She was right!  The restaurant had a lot of locals/ regulars than the typical travelers, like ourselves. The servers knew a lot of the people by first name, so that's pretty cool. My 12 year old nephew ate every last bite of his 3 taco carne asada plate! He said it was the best Mexican food ever. My 5 year old son had the open faced quesadilla and ate more than half (which is a lot for him), my step daughter ate every bite of her bean and cheese burrito. I had the veggie fajitas and there was so much food! Plenty for two people to share!! The veggies were fresh with carrots, onions, asparagus, green beans, potatoes... Such a mixture but believe me it was good! I'm not a meat eater so it was delicious for my liking. My mom got a fish dish that was delicious, cooked perfect with great flavor and not fishy tasting at all. The staff was friendly and welcoming even after my son spilled an entire water all over our table ( we actually had to move tables). We didn't go to the restaurant for decor, we went strictly for the food. So if that bothers some yelpers that's their opinion. Small and dated would be the only negative but I would still give this place a two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Loved the chile relleno! Large portions. Fast service. Excellent prices. We will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I come to this place often. You must order a cheese crisp. They are to die for! The portions are massive if you get the combo dinners. I would suggest maybe sharing one with someone since they are so big. Unless you want leftovers which is not a bad thing! If I could say one negative thing about the place, the seats definitely need to be reupholstered or something because they are looking (and feeling rough) but that won't stop us from being back!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Mexican place! LOVE the Margaritas!!! Me and my husband frequent this place often. Amazing Queso dip and Steak burritos!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, to say the least.  Mediocre (cold) chips and salsa.  Good Margarita (I upgraded to Milagro tequila).  I asked my waitress what she recommended (beef fajitas) and tried everything on the plate, but I will not be bringing the leftovers (lots!)  home.  They can put in the garbage or \"re-gift\"!!!  I don't understand how/why this place has so many great reviews....no atmosphere, run-of-the-mill Mexican food, average service.  Will not be returning...too many really good Mexican food restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Great local place with great food. True Tex-Mex queso with chorizo is awesome!   Everyone super nice. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is NOT real Mexican food..it is TOURIST Mexican food.  Look at the pictures here if you do not believe me...typical rice, beans, lettuce, flour, and NO MEAT.  A good place to do if you have relatives in town and want to get rid of them...take them here and they will go away in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Good foot, cheap prices on Alcohol and food!  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Perfect family run local Mexican food joint with some of the finest tequila in town.  At least the variety is fine.  The flautas are great and the service good.  Busy on weekends"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this restaurant. This is your old school Mexican joint. Not fancy, been here for years and a great Tequila alter."}
{"text":"Back here in Phoenix again, and our first stop for dinner is always Via Delosantos. Love, love, love this place.  It's nothing super-special, just good food, good service, excellent prices.   We always sit in the bar - love the vibe in there. It's casual, and definitely a \"local\" spot, but you never feel out of place. Free chips and salsa and the two salsas are delish.  Only weird thing was this time, I wanted two different kinds of chili rellenos... one cheese and one shredded beef, with a side of rice and beans.... they brought me TWO COMPLETE dinners..... each plate with rice & beans. Odd.  Stopped back a couple days later for a margarita at the bar after an evening out, and the bartender and all the patrons were fun and friendly and you can't beat the $2.99 margaritas.   It's always busy - that says it all."}
{"text":"update, and a warning to you.  repeat visit 1: a nickel in the nachos, not a dime, a fucking nickel....last i check this is a major health violation.  repeat visit 2:  egg shells in my Chorizo Burrito.   on a positive note: i didn't see any insect diners on my table. but i didn't look underneath it in fear of seeing a swarm. remember that movie Candyman..remember the bee's in the toilet...yea that gives you a mental picture.  this place must have some serious pull to not have been shut down by now."}
{"text":"This is basically a one or two star dive that gets 4 food stars for an extensive menu dotted with quirky vegetarian options rarely seen on a Mexican menu.  Several dishes feature calabacitas (zucchini), corn, cabbage,etc. - including a calabacitas stroganoff type dish over a bed of egg noodles (instead of spanish rice), which was filling and tasty.  I'm not vegetarian - I just think it's different and interesting. The salsa is also unusually good.   Our service has been below average more than once and the atmosphere inside can be quite dark and dreary. Once, a guy in the front of the parking lot was trying to sell his shotgun in broad daylight.  I dont say that to imply any sense of danger as to convey the marginal Sunnyslope surroundings that might offend certain sensibilities.    I'm glad I tried Via Delosantos.  We still joke about the shotgun, and the menu's a kick. But I dont plan on returning anytime soon...not unless someone puts a gun to my head"}
