{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. Classic, no frills great barbecue. Easy in and out and friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our go-to for barbecue. Definitely a no frills destination.  But, the food cannot be beat.  The service is lightning quick.   The food perfectly hot or cold--depending on what you order.  And, the side dishes are not the typical commercial style beans and potato salad.  Nope.  You have to try the cucumber salad. And, the Mac n Cheese tastes homemade.  Finally, the large banana pudding is perfect for sharing..later on that night. You're just too full of BBQ goodness to eat it right away.  Give it a go.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great lunch! From California and travel the states and this BBQ stands up to the nations best. Fast, cheap, friendly and good food!"}
{"text":"Agree with the others.  Having tried multiple BBQ joints around Charlotte this is definitely the best.  The Q is clean (no fat, gristle, etc.) and it was moist.  The side were all very good. Like the fact that they have both red and white slaw.  Portions are large and staff was friendly.   Would definely recommend."}
{"text":"We were in town for a few days visiting and I wanted to find a local BBQ \"hole in the wall\" establishment.  We were not disappointed...

The staff was very accommodating with us as my 84 year old mom is in a wheelchair and we needed space.  We ordered the family platter with a slab of ribs and sides.  Now, I love BBQ and this place does BBQ justice.  Reasonable pricing and close to where we were staying.  
Great Staff
Great Pricing
Will come back if we are back in the area - it's that good!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken with mustard sauce (Carolina Gold) is super tasty. We recommend that you branch out and give it a try."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ every time I am down this was I get two sandwiches best BBQ around. Very fast and the people are very nice. Have to get there early sometimes they sell out"}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious BBQ at a decent price.  I strongly recommend splurging and getting some banana pudding, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Great bbq at a great price. The macaroni and cheese is out of this world! I received my food quickly and everything was cooked perfectly. The guy behind the counter was friendly. I am making this my new bbq joint :)"}
{"text":"Great bbq joint. The pork is delicious by itself, but I believe they have 4 choices of sauce (my favorite being the mustard based), with a red slaw and white slaw to choose from. (I would recommend the white if you get the sandwich, red if to the side). The pricing is very reasonable includes tax which really seems to simplify and speed up service. The only downside is having to choose between the pulled pork or the ribs..."}
{"text":"I had ribs here tonight.   They were OK.   I have had better . . even in my Native Ohio.   The ribs were tender ... smokey .. but way too wet with sauce.   The sauce was average . . . I would not call these Carolinna Ribs either . ."}
{"text":"My husband is so obsessed with this restaurant! It may not look like much from the outside but it is fantastic! My husband got the full rack of ribs and I got the Pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were great. My obsession from this place is definitely the corn bread It is so sweet...almost like cake :) && I love cake! 

Definitely a great place to try if you are looking for a local joint with awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pulled pork BBQ at a good price. This is no frills - not many seats so takeout is best, sides are good but nothing extraordinary. But, it's definitely worth the BBQ! We live nearby and come often."}
{"text":"Simple menu at one of the best stops in town, sweet tender and juicy BBQ with your choice of sauce.  Quick service but expect a line at the busy time"}
{"text":"A lot of people around here love this place.  Its not bad,  I just think there is better out there.  I think some additional sauce options would help."}
{"text":"Omg! This is like the best barbecue place everrrrrr! The guys working are super nice and the food is just flat out awesomeee! I love the place so much; as a little girl (I'm 17now lol) my dad would always bring me and I would always get banana pudding! Try it you won't regret it!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to rock store for years and unfortunately the quality is getting lower. I used to come here for BBQ and corn bread all the time and the pork was fresh and had great smoke flavor. Now I feel that the pulled pork is very lackluster with little flavor. If I do go there I get chicken and even it it overlooked and just sitting in juices. I prefer fresh food and all theirs is sitting for quite a while before it's served. If you want good BBQ, go to Elwood's or saucemans."}
{"text":"The sandwich combo is one of the best deals in town. The guys running this place are very friendly and the food is delicious. Try the red slaw on your sandwich!"}
{"text":"Have been twice, both times for takeout. 

The place is weirdly attached to a gas station, but don't let that fool you. This place is really good and the staff is very friendly . They were out of brisket the first time, but the pork made up for it. I also really like places with numerous sauces to choose from. Both the tomato based and the carolina-style sauces are good. 

Went back a second time to get the brisket and it was some of the best in the area. Our favorite has been Mac's Speedshop, but this is definitely up there. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that the brisket was chopped up, would love the option to have it sliced. 

Will be back.....SOON."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  Their cornbread is to die for and you gotta love their tomato based bbq sauce.  Goes well with the pork, yum!  Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Charlotte!! Wonderful customer service! Love them! Highly recommend!! The restaurant is always clean and welcoming and the staff are so friendly and helpful! The food is Amazing! You will love it!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place by any means but it's bbq, who cares. That being said, Rock Store is some of the best old school bbq in the Charlotte area and the prices are great! My personal favorites are the pulled pork, ribs, mac n cheese, Brunswick stew, and of course maybe the best corn bread I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would have to put this in my top 5 of best bbq that I have eaten. I had the ribs... Tender and lean.  They had a mild tomato based sauce . The sauce was slightly sweet and tasty. Mild smoke on the ribs. Very good. The Mac and Cheese was well worth trying. The corn bread had to be the best I have ever had! sorry mom.... It was moist and sweet.

I will be back on my next trip. Give it a try. You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Nothing but love for this place.  Simple, cheap, fast and soooo good.  They offer a variety of sauces and sides to suit all tastes."}
{"text":"Ribs!!!  The ribs at this quaint, tiny BBQ location in Stallings are to die for.  Personally, I like the Carolina BBQ (sweet vs. mustard based), but they have plenty to choose from.  Ribs come with plenty (some say too much) sauce, but that's the secret stuff.  

The pulled pork is great and the chicken is by far my wife's favorite.  Take some home and be sure to get a bottle of the rib sauce to take with you.  The corn bread is more like pound cake, and perhaps that's why I can't get enough of it.  

Not many places to sit, so if you love their food and want to eat at the restaurant, then come early, or eat at their location in Mint Hill off of Hwy 51.

Don't forget the banana pudding for desert.  Only complaint is that you can't get it in a gallon container.  :-)"}
{"text":"We are pretty new to the area and have tried a few BBQ places that were just OK, nothing special. Saw this one was close by so decided to give it a try. We had the Family Special with Mac-n-cheese for the kids and the baked beans plus a half-rack of ribs.......sooooooo good!!! The order was ready in just a few minutes and the staff were super friendly. There are a handful of tables to sit at but we took it to go. This will definitely be our go-to place for BBQ."}
{"text":"BEST Bar-B-Q in the Charlotte Area. Friendly staff that know how to smoke. Love the pulled pork. The sauces are great. But my favorite side of Cucumber Salad is what keeps me coming back for more. I tried to duplicate but I can't get the balance they have mmmm. Located in a historic old Gas Station building, Small eat in area with Picnic tables, great atmosphere what you want when you think Bar-B-Q.  THIS place is where we always take family and friends when they visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after living in Indian Trail for just over a year and a half. Stopped in with some out of town company. We had the pulled pork lunch special and banana pudding. Very delicious and I loved the variety of sauces. Casual atmosphere, uptight people stay clear if you want privacy."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken is magnificent. I prefer the Carolina Gold sauce. The corn bread is mouthwatering and you should finish with Banana pudding!  Make sure you look at their hours  because they close earlier than most restaurants.  I suspect this is because they are so busy that they don't have to stay open late to make money.  If you love good southern BBQ, then you have to give this place a try.  They have a great selection of sauces that are all good.  You will just have to decide which is YOUR favorite!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best bbq joints in the area. The meat is exceptional, the staff is always smiling and exceptionally friendly, the sauces are well worth buying and taking home. The sides seem commercial, but I'm there for what comes out of the smoker so sides don't matter. Definitely recommend, I feel fortunate to live so close to this treasure!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of BBQ, but I do like it from time to time. i think this is the best I've ever had. The flavor of the pulled pork is delicious. For sides we have gotten the baked beans, macaroni and cheese, cole slaw and corn bread-all were excellent. Very affordable, too. I thought the BBQ sauce was good, but I'm from New England so what do I know?!"}
{"text":"Mouth-watering, crave-able  (is that even a word?) finely chopped, aromatic Q on a little bun. Red slaw is my choice of side. They have no fryers, so, no fries, onion rings or hushpuppies, but you will not miss those fillers with this sandwich! Banana pudding is popular, too- but I'd save room for another sandwich! Oh, the all stone exterior is cool, all pine inside is traditional and cool to see these days. 
 Small establishment, so take-out is easy; nothing to spill."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.

The \"cleanest\" pulled pork I've ever had.  A choice of 4 sauces.  Great sides that aren't fries!  Ribs to die for.  UNSWEET tea!  What a wonderful little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Indian trail nc you owe it to your self to stop and check this place out. Some of the best baby back ribs I have ever had the pleasure of eating. This place is road side bbq at its best! Bbq beans were wonderful as well with the corn bread. This place just rules and you should try it some time."}
{"text":"A killer little place. If you can't drive out to Waxhaw NC and get the best BBQ in Union County at South Main St BBQ, then you can eat here at the second best BBQ joint in Union County. That's high praise coming from me. Tell Bubba Jack, Big John says Gitter Done."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The BBQ is so, so good. Get the Mac and cheese, you won't regret it. The service is awesome. Eat here now and eat here often."}
{"text":"Was a nice little place in the middle of no where. So glad we didn't miss it. The food was spectacular! Ribs were fall off the bone quality. Corn bread is a must try! So moist. Definitely will be coming back if we ever go back this way. Must try spot!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!! Best BBQ around! The staff are very friendly also :)
The only thing bad I have to say about this place is there not open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, just tried it out of the blue and glad i did. owner was very helpful, quick service, and amazing food. definitely going back!"}
{"text":"There was a gentleman sitting outside who greeted us as if we were long lost friends, and this set the atmosphere for the rest of our experience. The service was great and the food was even better! Their barbecue is exactly what we've been searching for. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ, definitely not the best I've had but hits the spot. Wasn't a huge fan of the Mac and cheese, too fake cheese tasting. Corn bread and banana pudding were both excellent!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive BBQ.  Way too much sauce on the ribs.  Couldn't really taste the meat.  I'd stick with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Flavor used to be good, now it's losing it's taste. Might be switching to freezer made stuff, not sure."}
{"text":"It's affordable!  And my parents love their pork BBQ sandwiches.  And there is a fantastic produce stand adjacent.  The young man that helped us was friendly enough.  That's the end of the good points for me.

Located on Old Monroe Rd, the rock store itself has been there for ages.  I dated a Union County boy for 6 years and passed this more times than I care to think about while it was convenience store.  My folks mentioned a couple of times how good the BBQ sandwiches were, and always on the search for excellent BBQ and ribs I thought I should make a visit to bring some takeout to the parentals to score inheritance points.  

I wanted to try a variety of things so I got the 1/2 rack rib platter, which comes with 2 sides and a drink ($13), and a pork BBQ sandwich ($4).  I chose the mac and cheese and beans for sides, which come in small styrofoam cups.  The ribs were tender with plenty of meat but were boring - I make better ribs in my crockpot (then broiler) with Bulls Eye sauce.  The mac and cheese tasted like Stouffer's.  The beans seemed to be straight out of a can - my mom's baked beans (with BACON) are exponentially better.  And the pulled pork BBQ was tasteless - I guess you add the sauce to make it better, but I like BBQ that can stand on it's own - the bun had more flavor than the pork.  And the slaw served with it tasted weird.  Mom said it was mayo slaw, but bleh.  I put it on my sandwich, only to scrape it off.  The cup of mild sauce that we got was fine, but it is a very thin sauce that ran off of the sandwich.

If you like plain BBQ, this is the place for you.  If you want any kind of food with any kind of flavor, keep moving."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Bar-B-Q in the area.  Even ignoring the value it has the best BBQ in Matthews-Stallings-Indian Trail.  Throw in huge portions that you get for the \"Family Size\", and you can't beat it.  Even had them cater our daughter's graduation. They delivered and set everything up.  Great price for that as well.  Note that this is mainly a \"to-go\" outfit.  They have a few places to sit and eat, but almost everyone gets it to-go.  Parking can be a little tricky with the odd road angles, so be careful!"}
{"text":"Amazing find, thanks Yelp.  Came in for a meeting and had to grab lunch so I found this gem.  The food is amazing and the service is awesome.  I got the pulled pork Sammy with baked beans as a side and the slaw that was vinegar based.  Everything was on point.  I wish they had places like this is Cali...."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was nice and tender. it had a good flavor without the BBQ sauce. I didn't like the flavor of the BBQ sauce. it was pretty runny and tangy , but I'm used to thick and sweet/spicy sauce....."}
{"text":"loved the pulled pork.  Moved from TX and the land of beef BBQ.  Couldn't wait to get some PIG.  YUM!!!  Would highly recommend you give Rock Store a try.  

They also carry a local sausage (made in Wadesboro) that is worth the money.  Great flavor and enough fat to make good gravy.  These days that is hard to find in commerical sausages."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent pulled pork barbecue and ribs. Today I brought in my in-laws from Boston and they absolutely loved it. We mentioned that they were visiting and they threw in extra cornbread and even ended up giving us two T-shirts. I highly recommend the macaroni and cheese banana pudding and cucumber salad. The corn bread is to die for. Delicious food and inexpensive and you get real southern hospitality. This is definitely my favorite barbecue place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rock House barbecue. The people that wait on you are awesome, the barbecue is lean and the homemade sauce is out of this world. You won't find a better value than the pork barbecue sandwich combo.  Be sure to try the homemade Brunswick stew!"}
{"text":"Grew up here and this is the best Carolina BBQ in the area. I always make sure to stop by a few times whenever I'm in town. Incredible sauces, good sides; everything's just rock solid. I've been wanting to try the ribs for a while but the pulled pork is so good I haven't gotten around to it. They also have an amazing little farmer's market right next store. Too bad these little places aren't all over the country..."}
{"text":"My husband loves barbecue, came here because of the amazing reviews and was worth it! Firstly can we say how adorable this place is?? I know that's not important to the boys but the charm is incredible, love the building. I can say that because the food is great!! The pork is just perfect, the ribs are so meaty and fall off the bone, incredible! Now I asked them before choosing sides what they would recommend. They said they don't make them in house and I appreciated their honesty... I haven't been a fan of the sides, so I just get the meat here take out style and use my own sides. Can I again say how cute this building is??? Seriously!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the pork sandwiches are awesome, I will go there everyday when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is good BBQ. Don't get me wrong, I just don't find anything exceptional about it. It's all pulled and in my opinion the chicken is some of the best in this area. The pork tends to be smashed together. There are many sauces to choose from and they are very good. I have and will go back here, I just wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"1st visit today. An old high school friend works here. I've eaten it all, Memphis, Eastern NC, Lexington, you name it. This is as good as it gets. Had the pulled pork sandwich with the sweet tomato sauce and Brunswick stew. Porky was very smoky and flavorful. The stew was perfect. Thick, just the way I like it. Took home a pound of the pork. I'll try the ribs next time. You will NOT be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This hideaway is a best kept secret.  I been going here for over a year and the food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS.  The Ribs are #1 hands down.  I Luv the homemade barbecue sauce.  This is a keeper!!"}
{"text":"Used to have a Good lunch deal for $5.. Now it's a lot more for average BBQ cooked somewhere else ... Moe's in Matthews runs rings around this. Mac and cheese taste like freezer made microwave  brand."}
{"text":"The price is fair. The ribs are above average, but the pulled pork sandwich and hushpuppies are the real reason to visit."}
{"text":"Want some delicious famous, smoky Carolina 'Cue?!?  Head out to Stallings to the unique Rock Store Bar-B-Cue!  Try the BBQ Sandwich special which includes a side and drink for only $6 including tax.  There are 4 different types of sauce (vinegar, hot, mustard, and Stallings secret).  The barbecue baked beans are delish but the brunswick stew I wasn't really crazy about.  Overall great food and affordable!  And lucky for me...close by!"}
{"text":"Very good bbq in a small venue 6-7 indoor tables.  Nice staff.  Good portions. Meat was flavorful.  Only complaint would be remove the membrane from the back of the ribs.  I had pork, ribs, Brunswick stew and beans.  I was not disappointed.  Need good Q?  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Locally-owned, friendly, efficient, and delicious. Pretty soon my blood type will be vinegar based..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Staying in town for just a couple days and was looking for a good barbecue place. I read reviews on yelp and let me tell you, they did not let me down!!!! The pulled pork and chicken was amazing....the barbecue sauce was out of this world. The service was great, they kept checking on us and making sure we were ok. If you are looking for a great place to eat, chose them!"}
{"text":"I love this place My father loved this place! You guys rock ! The mac and cheese great pulled pork great! Thank you for the great food!"}
{"text":"Very rustic and southern style joint. You walk into the small building and there's deer antlers and pig antiques by the tables. The BBQ Pork sandwich was a good portion with a nice smoky flavor and it came with a side and a drink for only $6.50. And when I say $6.50, it was EXACTLY $6.50, they don't bother to play with tax. They had 4 different types of sauce, Texas Pete, a homemade sweet/tangy BBQ, homemade Eastern Carolina Vinegar based sauce, and their very own Stallings Secret sauce. Overall great experience, I'd highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Don't have words to explain how good the food is, All I can say is it can't be better than this. No matter what you get, everything is so yummy."}
{"text":"The brisket at Rock Store is delicious! I do wish they had it sliced, but what do I care it still tastes fantastic. This is a new tradition on the way home from the beach...stopping at Rock Store to stuff ourselves silly one last time before vacation ends =)

Their sandwich combos are $6.50 (I believe) and you will be stuffed! Last time I got the brisket sammy and potato salad .  

Wish I lived closer so I could make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork, definitely tell they put everything they got into their cooking!!! If anyone has a better recipe than they have for corn bread I'd like to try it!! Absolutely the best I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Rock Store has become almost an every-week lunch place for me. I love the pork BBQ sandwich special - an affordable and filling option that comes with a drink where other places charge $2 for a soda...

Priced like a fast food restaurant, but the food is so much better than anything you'd find in a McDonald's, BK or the like. 

They have 4 sauces on the table - hot sauce, Carolina Gold (mustard based), Stallings Secret (ketchup based) and a vinegar based. Personally, I love the vinegar sauce and the Stallings Secret sauce. 

The building sits on the side of the road in a historic store made of rock (hence Rock Store), so it's pretty easy to spot. Seating inside is limited, and can be hard to find a spot during the busy lunch hour. There are 2 picnic tables outside when the weather's nice, and as a bonus during the spring/summer/fall months, the Providence Produce stand is directly adjacent.

Everyone has differing opinions about what good BBQ is, but Rock Store is the best BBQ around for me."}
{"text":"The cornbread is awesome!  I know that sounds a little strange with a barbecue place but it is just amazing.  The pulled pork was really great as well, the original sauce is my favorite but the mustard based was very good as well.  The mac and cheese is definitely not Kraft!  Staff are super friendly as well, great place!"}
{"text":"We picked up pulled pork BBQ based on the great reviews on yelp. I found the pork to be bland and soggy. The place is very tiny and we had to wait in line to order right next to people eating. I was definetly invading their personal space but had no choice. I do not recommend"}
{"text":"My go to place for a no-nonsense rack of ribs. I'm a Yankee so I have them put the sauce on the side. Cucumber, onion in vinegar side perfectly off sets the BBQ sauce. An added bonus in the summer, a farm to table produce stand right next door. Peaches, oh the peaches!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, where the Bbq is best!  However, the pulled pork sandwich and Mac-n-cheese are excellent here!"}
{"text":"The VERY best BBQ Sandwich anywhere!!! Their sauces are amazing and their tea is great. We like the beans, slaw, banana pudding, cucumber salad."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, good mac & cheese, and great corn bread. I didn't try the iced tea, unfortunately. The service was friendly, too. It's a nice little place with tasty food. I would return."}
{"text":"Have always heard about this place and we was in the area this past weekend so we checked it out. The first thing the place is small but the employees are very friendly. The prices are good and get a large amount for the price. We did the sandwich's and the BBQ was great & the different sauces was also very good. I would recommend this too anyone in the area or BBQ fans. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Building is neat, employees helpful and polite, sauces were good, great lunch price but I found the food itself bland. The pork was tender but the only flavor it had was of propane.  It required quite a bit of sauce to enjoy. With that said I have had much worse BBQ but I was expecting more from past reviews."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and a nice selection of sauces! This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"While driving around on my latest adventure from Colorado, I came across this gem. I ordered a half slab combo meal with coleslaw and banana pudding. The ribs were delicious!!! So much so I had to get the other half slab, hahaha. The coleslaw was very tasty and the banana pudding, perfect dessert. I got a T-shirt so I could always remember where I had some of the tastiest ribs ever!!! The staff was way beyond nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ! Just got the pulled pork and it was excellent. My wife gave a hearty thumbs up for the red slaw and my daughter said the mac and cheese were awesome. Baked beans were a bit of a disappointment.. but after eating the burnt end baked beans from Haywood Smokehouse in Dillsboro, nobody's beans are going to come close. The Brunswick stew was good."}
{"text":"We stopped at this little joint while traveling back to PA, and we were not disappointed. The staff was super friendly, and the BBQ was great. The baked beans, white slaw, and macaroni & cheese were also delicious. I would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Man, a little taste of home (eastern NC).  Like another reviewer said, very 'clean' pulled pork.  Probably best I've had in years.  Great eastern Carolina sauce.  Cucumber and onion salad is delicious and the Brunswick stew is just a hair off awesome.  

Simple styro plates and cups, plastic spoons, etc.  

Affordable too! Lunch special for $6, plate and 2 sides is $8 (flat!)"}
{"text":"We are down here from Ct visiting our daughter. We wanted some place for some good eats and BBQ is always a top
Priority. I would rate this place a 10!!!!
The pulled pork is amazing and the sides of mac and cheese, Cole Slaw, baked beans, and corn bread were the best I've ever had!! Little mom and pop place with excellent food. Can't wait till next time we come down."}
{"text":"Love this bbq.  You might pass it by, because of the size,  but you won't be disappointed.  Usually get the pulled pork.  All the sauces are good but mosty I have the vinegar sauce.   It's always consistent so you know what you're getting.  The cornbread is really good as well."}
{"text":"This is only  a review of the pulled pork as I've only ordered that at two of their locations. I was really disappointed , both times. Did not at all taste as if it had been grilled, smoked, or ever come near a BBQ. Tasted as if it were roasted in an oven. Bland, too moist, and not a lot of flavor. I went here looking to find good pulled pork and left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ
Ribs way over sauced, wiped off, then bland and fat not rendered. 
Pork bland, but ok. 
Beans nothing different than canned. 
Good corn bread. 
Nice staff with friendly service. 
Chop their brisket, which means something to other BBQ people"}
{"text":"This place is cute on the outside but Not so good on the inside. The barbque sandwich was not my favorite. But my hub said his barbque platter was ok.

The seating area was ugly, old, cramped & felt dirty. Worse than an old Hardee's.  I guess I was expecting a cute decor to match the outside. 

The guy at the order counter was rude & uptight. Hub had opened a cooler door which was right at the register (on our side, not behind the counter) to get a cup of coleslaw & the guy said, \"Don't touch that. We don't allow customers to get their own.\" Well then why is right beside the counter?
This place needs help. It's in a great location & has a beautiful exterior. It could be a gold mine if the inside decor matched. And they hired nicer people."}
{"text":"I must say that one of the benefits to living in Matthews is that the very best BBQ place in the Charlotte area is just a few miles away in the Rock Store.  While the exterior is very unassuming, the throng of cars parked around the building should give you an indication as to what awaits inside.  

The pork is pulled, not chopped so it holds the flavor better.  I prefer mine with coleslaw on top and their sweet sauce however they have mustard-based and even that inferior vinegar stuff if you so choose.  

While you might be tempted to go for the pork sandwich special, the better deal is the pork plate, which comes with a bun and enough food for two sandwiches.  Still better yet is the family-size which has enough for 6 or 7 sandwiches.  

Pork BBQ not your thing, don't stress.  They have chicken and beef available as well but their pork is unlike anything I've had anywhere.  

I've also recently ordered a slab of ribs to take home all for my self - which was delish.  The meat fell off the bone!

For those that revere Lexington BBQ as the best in the state of North Carolina, I must respectfully disagree and say that The Rock Store is clearly the best by a country mile"}
{"text":"Great little place for BBQ - emphasis on the \"little\".  It's tiny.  However, they have excellent pulled pork, and the mac and cheese is really good, too.  The sides are packaged in individual containers, hot or cold, and you eat on paper plates with plastic silverware, so there is no evidence when you're done.  Everything goes in the trash, and you leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Seriously good BBQ!! The food is great! The ribs are a family favorite. The service is fast, efficient, and friendly - everything you'd want!"}
{"text":"First time here after seeing this place for several years. Let me tell you it's the closest to the place dad and I used to eat at in Lexington NC home of the best bbq in the US. I really liked this little place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been on a bbq kick for lunch lately. This place hits the spot. A tiny little rock store, literally, right on Old Monroe Rd in the Stallings area. They do a $6 sandwich special with pulled bbq sandwich, side & drink. Super quick and tasty. I really like the pulled pork. Nice flavor. Good sauces too. I'm a fan of the baked beans, mac & cheese and the banana pudding. Friendly service and there is a fresh produce stand right next door. If you're in the area, looking for a quick bbq lunch, this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, have been here several times.  It is a gem of a BBQ place, best beef brisket around...and the banana pudding is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We got the half-rack rib platter, and the pulled pork sandwich combo. Both were decent, but certainly nothing to write home about. The ribs were SLATHERED in bbq sauce so much so that you couldn't even taste the meat. As for sides, the cornbread was more like a cake consistency, the slaw was rather bland, the mac & cheese was just ok, and we are 99.9% sure the beans were actually Bush's Baked Beans from a can - not bad, but also not winning any awards. Bottom line, we'll be sticking with Midwood Smokehouse for our bbq needs."}
{"text":"Gotta say I was surprised at this place...I maybe a frequent customer.

They dry rub the ribs then add a tomato based sauce on top of it. The meat was just about falling off the bone and good. The sauce on the ribs, frankly I gotta try it again. It was good I just couldn't get a feel for it. Not spicy, a little sweet with smoky

I also got a pulled pork sandwich, yes I did get a half a rack and a sandwich, what, big man gotta eat!  The sauces on the table where good I tried eat one. The mustard based one had a kick to it that I'm gonna venture and try again.

I asked about the rib sauce and they don't keep it on the table just for the ribs.

Only bad part was how the served the corn beard in aluminum foil for some reason that reminded me of school lunch back in the day. I ate it though!

I'll be back at the Rock Store and we'll update when I've got a clearer picture. A solid 4 star on the Que for now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Some of the best bbq I have had. It's a small place, but big on taste. The service has been nothing but stellar every time I have eaten there. Food is always fresh, highly recommend. They recently in the past year expanded their parking lot making it easier to get in and out."}
{"text":"My first taste of North Carolina BBQ.

All the meats are pulled, smoky, tender, moist and delicious...key elements of BBQ. I walked into the place and it felt like home, smelt like home but if the two dudes at the counter were in my home, I'd be slightly taken aback. 

We had a half rack of ribs and the Family Meal(1.5 pounds of meat and 3 sides) so we ordered a half pound of chicken, pork and brisket with red slaw, brunswick stew and baked beans. Slaw was awesome, stew was a little too tomato for me and the beans were great 

They cover all bases, saucewise. They have the South Carolina mustard base, the runny east Carolina tang and the tomato base Carolina sweet and hot, some of the best sauces I've tried.

Ribs place 2nd all time, behind Jim N Nicks...they come clean off the bone.

They're doin' things right at Rock Store...

{"text":"Great pulled pork and ribs.  Their meat is some of the best in Charlotte and they have reall good BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Definitely had better barbecue. Their sides were just average as well. Expected more from a barbecue restaurant."}
{"text":"My go to place for ribs and pork! Love their rib sauce. Corn bread and banana pudding is amazing. Don't care much for either of the slaws though."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!!! I got the pork sandwich which was delicious. I put carolina sauce on it along with slaw and it was the best BBQ sandwich I've  had in a long time. I also got the Mac n cheese which was creamy and heavenly and the cornbread. I have never been a fan of cornbread, but it tasted like cake!! So sweet and fluffy.
This is my new go to for BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!!! We got the pulled pork, mac and cheese, corn bread, and banana pudding. It was all freaking amazing. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Sooo yummy! Good portions too, not skimpy. Cornbread is super moist and their \"secret\" sauce is amazing! Inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Well I want by there yesterday for the first time for a quick lunch and of course after reading all the reviews with high expectations . 

I walked in the door and of course you can smell this amazing barbecue aroma . I ordered the pulled pork plate with a side of mac & cheese . Now I've had pulled pork before and on its own and it's usually this warm smoky  juicy and awesome tenderness thing going on . 

Yesterday when I got home after a ride of maybe seven minutes to my house it was ice cold dry and flavorless. Needless to say my first impression was not great. Now I did get the spicy mustard sauce out of the bag put it on the cold pulled pork heated it up the microwave and Bam it just woke everything up it was great I really enjoyed the meal as I thought it should've been prepared or should've been presented when I pick it up. 

I've been around long enough to know that sometimes first impressions aren't always correct no matter how much we research or anticipate I still believe in the three strike rule. Trust your instincts trust your gut whatever you want to call it people inherently use this to decide whether not they like something for me I believe integrity loyalty honesty is truly important. Wow I was really rambling on sorry, anyway I'm going back to try again"}
