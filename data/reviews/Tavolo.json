{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing service ! If you come to charlotte you have to eat here ! Best Italian margarita I've ever had ."}
{"text":"Had dinner with group of six. Food is OK, not anything to talk about! Service was very slow! They were not busy at all! To many other great option in Charlotte! Would I go back? Nah."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I was with a group of 8 and it took well over 2.5 hours to finish dinner. I think it took over 45 minutes just to get our check, let alone pay for it. Staff & managers were just standing around staring at us while we all actively looked for our server with our money out trying to pay. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great Italian food in a fun environment. The wood fired pizza was excellent and the portions are big."}
{"text":"Dropped in on this relatively new establishment on a chilly night while in Charlotte last week and had a wonderful experience. Since I was solo I sat at the bar. The staff was exceptionally attentive and helpful with suggestions. After a neat glass of scotch to take the chill off, enjoyed a delicious bowl of minestrone soup followed by a perfect veal marsala over linguine. The meal was accompanied by their house Italian red wine which was a very reasonable $8 glass. Nice atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"I ordered the calamari appetizer and the frutti di mare. The calamari was cooked well and was good. The frutti di mare wasn't bad, just bland. If you are in the mood for Italian food in Uptown it doesn't hurt to try out Tavolo. I've definitely had worse; I just wasn't impressed either. No complaints when it came to the service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice holiday lunch with my co-workers today. The food was incredible and the service was as well. It was not crowded at lunch. The pizza was delicious and so was the Risotto Rustica. Good menu for vegetarians and carnivores with a wide variety of options on the menu. We will return!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, ambiance, and staff!

We had a private party here, and Anthony was a breeze to work with - confident, happy, and quick to respond. The event itself was great.  We received excellent attention from staff during cocktail hour and dinner.  The food was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We used the full first floor, and our presentation could be seen and heard by all.  Would highly recommend for a private event.  They also have a cool smaller upstairs area with a bar, and it looks like they can accommodate a party of almost any size."}
{"text":"It was nice to see the decor change from the previous restaurant (Cosmo's).  I would go to Cosmo's for drinks so I usually only focused on the bar area.  This time we decided to try Tavolo and have a meal after a show Uptown.  The layout is very open but at the same time we felt it was intimate enough that we weren't staring at people and in their conversations. 

Our waiter George was phenomenal and very attentive.  He was able to answer our questions and made suggestions. 

The drinks were okay but I was not happy they added champagne to one of my drinks and it wasn't listed among the ingredients.  I don't like carbonation.  I was given another drink and was pleased.  

The food was okay.  We had the seafood risotto and the pepperoni pizza.  It was reasonably priced so it may be worthwhile stopping by again after a show."}
{"text":"I have only had the best experiences with Tavolo. 

I was recently in charge of planning our company party for 150 employees. I searched high and low for a restaurant to host the event and meet all of my high-maintenance needs. Tavolo not only meet all my needs, but was able to host the best event within my budget. Anthony was amazing to work with. He is very on top of things and has very strong communication! Any time I needed him, I was able to reach him!

The day of the event was very smooth. I showed up a couple hours early to set up and Anthony and his team had already done everything. They were so on top of things. They even brought in extra furniture and supplies to make the event extra special. Anthony and his staff truly made my event a smooth and memorable experience, accommodating to all of my companies needs and wants. The food was perfect. The drinks were perfect. The set up was perfect and the staff was perfect. 

It's been a couple weeks since out party and I am still receiving compliments for the wonderful celebration (even though I really owe it all to Tavolo!!!!) 

Since my event, I have gone back sever times with difference groups of friends. Every time I go, my group gushes over how great the food is. I have tried almost all of the dishes and each one is delicious!!!! 

I encourage everyone who reads this to stop by and eat at this amazing restaurant at some point!"}
{"text":"Great service from hostess and waiter. Food was delicious. Absolutely loved chicken saltibucca and chicken parmigiana foods danced on the tongue. Restaurant was very accommodating to our time constraints and attentive. Can't wait to come back when we have more time to enjoy this little gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last Sunday night and had the worst experience ever! We made reservations for 8p. When we arrived, the place was empty except for two other small tables. Right off, our waitress was odd. She mispronounced items on the menu and just overall had a weird presence and an odd way of \"recommending\" menu items (before even greeting us, she handed us the menu and blurted out her \"two favorites.\" We ordered two appetizers to share (which came out at different times). They were pretty bland and we didn't finish either. When ordering the entree I ordered by saying \"Can I do the spaghetti and meatballs with a pink sauce?\" and the waitress acted like I was absurd and had no idea what I was suggesting. She said \"well it comes with a bolognese sauce.\" I responded with \"oh okay, I didn't realize it did. I'll just take it like that then.\" Less than 10 min later our entrees arrived. Mine was a small rigatoni like noodle with bolognese sauce and a giant \"meatball\" in the middle. I asked \"is this the spaghetti and meatballs?\" The waitress muttered something about \"yes, well no, nevermind, it's my fault, I thought you wanted, hold on.\" and turned and just walked back to the kitchen with my plate. I insisted my husband start his meal. We were sitting (in a now empty restaurant with only one other 4 top table occupied) when the waitress, manager and two kitchen staff can be heard arguing about my meal and talking about me and what \"she wants.\" (I just ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, no alterations. The waitress is the one that said it came with a bolognese sauce.) The manager never bothered to come talk to us, they just stood there and talked about how I didn't like my meal and what else could I possibly want. We could hear everything, the place was empty. Less than 10 min later they brought out spaghetti noodles with a SCANT amount of bolognese sauce and a the exact same meatball from the prior dish, sauce scraped off the side and everything, haha! My husband even made the comment that everything must be pre-made back there bc there was no time for food to actually be \"cooked.\" Needless to say, I took one bite and this dish was as inedible as the apps and my husbands entree (he had a couple bites and pushed it aside before my meal even came). Neither of us mentioned not liking the dishes. It took longer to get the check than our meals combined. When we did get it, the waitress is not speaking to us at this point. The check was wrong, I don't even know how to explain but several random charges. I see the manager watching us from the kitchen. It's silent in the restaurant so I literally just ask him to come over, haha. He does and I ask him what the charges on our bill meant, I didn't mention the mix up or the dissatisfying food and service. He agrees that the charges are wrong and that he'll fix it to say I ordered the spaghetti and made some comment to the extent of \" since that's the closest thing to what you ordered.\" (um it is exactly what I ordered!) I apologized and told him I was sorry for any confusion I caused and I explained to him the conversation bw myself and the waitress. He didn't apologize but did say he would comp the spaghetti. Long story short, we paid over $50 for two half eaten appetizers, 3 bites of \"veal parm\" and two glasses of water. We were in and out of there in 35 minutes. This was supposed to be a romantic date night celebrating my husband's bday and it was so bad!"}
{"text":"They were across the street from our hotel. The valet said they are never very busy, but glad we came. I had the linguini with claims. It was really good. The bread they serve tastes really fresh. Not sure if they make it or not. Everyone with me enjoyed thier meals so yes I would come here again."}
{"text":"The wait staff and food overall were unimpressive..

Bread and Sun dried tomato oil - you have to ask for this! It was a pretty good sour dough bread. If you want butter, it's available by request. 

Cheese pizza - it was decent, I've had better. The sauce was a bit much. It also came with a pesto swirl on it. 

Fettuccini Alfredo - good sauce, but on the watery side. I asked for no parm on top and a side of mozzarella. I got a huge bowl full of mozzarella. That was pretty good."}
{"text":"Friendly, yummy and affordable Italian food! I tried
their bruschetta--nice balsamic drizzle, rice/cheese balls, and traditional thin crust pizza with mozzarella and basil. The bartender recommended the bocce ball cocktail which easily quenched my thirst. It's amaretto, vodka and orange juice very subtle and delicious. They have good happy hour specials. I parked in the 7th street deck around the corner. This is the old Cosmos location right by the Spirit Square theatre."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a pretty large group of ladies. They were able to accommodate our reservations with no problem. And minus a small hiccup while we waited to be seated....the service was friendly and efficient.

We ordered a wide variety of items off the menu. I sampled the mozzarella sticks and calamari and both were good. I'd say if you're undecided go with the mozzarella. It's a good size portion and the sauce is delicious. 

For dinner I ordered the seafood risotto. It comes topped with shrimp and crab meat. It was a good dish, a little salty (I have to keep these reviews honest) but overall it's a very filling dish. I love that they use the large shrimp! 

Overall, this place is A-OK for me. I'd definitely come back and give them a try with another dish. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"We visited this cozy Italian restaurant on a Saturday night, we had reservations but the place wasn't overly busy that you would have to wait without them. The decor is comforting, and the waitstaff very friendly. Our waitress even stood and talked to us for a while. 

Our party started with arancini's and calamari. The arancini's were good, but could have used more sauce. I personally like my calamari a little on the chewy side, which this was not. However those in my party who did not share my preferences said it was the best calamari that they have had. 

For our entree's we chose chicken parm, chicken Marsala, and a ravioli dish. My chicken Marsala was delicious. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and my partner was satisfied with his chicken parm although he said it could have used more sauce. 

For dessert I treated myself to a cannoli , and was not disappointed. 

Coming from a town with an Italian restaurant on every corner, I was pleasantly surprised with this Uptown establishment. Only complaint would be the portion size for the price. When dining at an italian place I typically expect to bring half my meal home, whereas these portions came with one piece of chicken per plate. Other than that a great place to dine Uptown before enjoying your night."}
{"text":"Food was reasonably priced. It was more of a casual restaurant. Limited menu. I tried the Chicken Alfredo, sauce was from scratch, chicken was good. Hubby had the lasagna, would defiantly  recommend the lasagna it was a huge portion for the price. Great for a casual date downtown."}
{"text":"When you are a great cook, it's difficult to go out to eat and find food more delicious then your own. When you grew up dinning on your Sicilian grandmothers homemade food, it's virtually impossible to find decent Italian food. Being a vegetarian, has made all these things even more difficult. Enter Tavolo.

I was pleasantly surprised by how many wonderful vegetarian options there are on the menu. Vegetarian Risotto, to Eggplant Parmesan, to a Vegetable Lasagna! I don't know if I have every been able to go into an Italian restaurant and have so many options to choose from. After scouring the menu for longer then I should (just so many choices!) I finally chose the Vegetable Lasagna. My husband ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. After devouring the delicious bread and sun dried tomato oil, our dishes came out piping hot! Honestly, not sure which dish I liked better. The red sauce had a wonderfully unique, yet traditional, flavor which accentuated both dishes amazingly. The noodles were well cooked, and the vegetables were fresh. No complaints! As a Sicilian, I couldn't cook better Italian food if I tried. Absolutely amazing. 

Wine list is on point as well. Great selection, and decent prices. I think my only gripe would be the fact that they don't seem to have any drink specials. They have a full bar, but it would be great if they had some unique drinks as well. 

This is a great little spot in Uptown. Wonderful food, great atmosphere, and fantastic location! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place in uptown Charlotte. Tavolo was a great place for us to get together for Happy Hour. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. As our group filtered in throughout the night, Paul, the bartender, would introduce himself and ask everyone their names. Throughout the night, Paul remembered everyone's name and what they were drinking. We ordered the Calamari, which was the best I have had in Charlotte and a flatbred/ pizza, which was also very good. I wish they had a wider beer selection and carried more of the craft beers, but other than that it was a great place. It is a huge upgrade over Cosmos that was in the location for years."}
{"text":"Do not come to this restaurant. Service is terrible! Management was not helpful when complaints were made. Still waiting to pay...#annoyed"}
{"text":"I went there fully intending on ordering the meatball sub off the Lunch express menu but easily talked into the Seafood risotto.  My friend had the same expectation but she also changed her order to the Rustico risotto.  Both were, in a hyphenated word, de-freakin-licous. 
I will definitely be going back to try other menu items.   As far as the service- it was a little slow but I'm fairly forgiving of that for a new place. The decor/ambiance is quite lovely and we took ourselves on a self tour of the upstairs lounge area.  Very nice!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Tavolo for a great Italian meal at a great price coupled with top notch service in Charlotte.  Our waitress, Kaila, was superb!  We shared a few appetizers, all of which were great:  calamari, bruschetta, rice balls.  Our main meals were equally great:  eggplant parm, penne with sausage, meatballs, meat lasagne.  The tiramisu was perhaps the best we have ever had!"}
{"text":"It's great new spot for Italian sit in restaurant near discovery place. The service was quick, well done and reasonably priced choices on their menu for vegetarians."}
{"text":"The old Cosmo's is now an Italian restaurant.  They offer a few express lunch sandwiches along with the regular dinner menu during lunch.  They don't have fresh pasta which is a little disappointing based on some of the prices.  The service was good and the waitress was pretty knowledgeable.  I tried the bolognese with rigatoni and it was not the best, not sure if it was the sauce or just too many noodles.  My friend had the margherita pizza, which was huge, but again it was just ok.  I think I was expecting more for the price....perhaps I'll give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here! It started with hot fresh bread with a flavorful olive oil with seasoning and minced roasted onion and/or garlic in it. The seafood risotto was fantastic and came with lots of crab and three large shrimp on top. Our waitress and service was fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great night at Tavolo,  the food was awesome the drinks was awesome, the staff was perfect if you want some real Italian food YOU NEED TO GO THERE!!"}
{"text":"I needed a vegan-friendly, fancy-ish business dinner, place that could fit 12 at a not-long skinny table, that was nearby some other cool places so we could party aferwards.  That was a high bar to meet, but luckily Tavolo met all of my criteria!

After chatting with a few restaurants over email & phone about their vegan options, I picked Tavolo for their willingness to work with us and generally super-nice email!

We almost had the place to ourselves on a Monday night after the Super Bowl, but the staff was very attentive, the food was great and the ambience was spot on.

If you're looking for a nice, but not too expensive place to eat in uptown - definitely give Tavolo a try!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken pesto sandwich and fries off the lunch menu.  Was $9.  The sandwich was a good size and the flavor of the chicken mixed with spinach, lemon etc was really tasty.  It was on ciabatta bread and the bread was warm and soft which made the sandwich more enjoyable.  The fries are really good as well. 

The service was ok but the food was good."}
{"text":"Beautifully appointed wine bar and Italian restaurant in their grand opening phase.  The bar is well stocked with many options.  Reviewed the menu to find lasagna, seafood dishes, wood fired pizza and salads.

We were greeted by very friendly staff who were learning the menu.  There is lots of room for groups.

We had drinks and dessert. The long Island Iced Tea was a great mix. The cheesecake is made in house and did not disappoint.  We will be back in December and I'll update my review at that time."}
{"text":"Omg it was delicious. I had some ravioli and killed the bread basket. Stephen was our server and he was really nice and attentive. The host hated me since I'm not a Duke fan lol. Good Italian spot in uptown."}
{"text":"5 star Italian cuisine downtown Charlotte!! From the hostess to the accessory staff and our wonderful waitress,  the service was wonderful!  The food was exquisite and plentiful!  Do Not Skip Dessert!  The cheesecake was heaven!  My daughter and I always get away to Charlotte from time to time for ballet and shopping.  This was the perfect restaurant on our girls weekend! We will Definitely revisit this delicious spot!"}
{"text":"WOW! Absolutely one of the best spots in town for casual Italian. Had the butternut squash soup (been under the weather) it was great! Followed by the Carbonara Risotto. To finish it off I had the tiramisu. So glad I stopped by would definitely recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have experienced in charlotte.  We had a reservation for 5 pm before a concert with 4 adults and 5 children.  20 min before we had water and almost 49 before the bottle of Prosecco.  Food was average at best.  No toilet paper in any stall in ladies room- only person I could find was the bartender who was also the manager and very rude.  He told me he didn't have time to replace toilet paper- and was very unfriendly.  Restaurant was at best half full.  30 minutes to pay- when went to inquire manager was rude.  Food was cold and not removed from bill."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends (Monday) and the place had about 6-8 tables full, but overall the place was very empty. We arrived at 7pm. 

We were greeted right away by our server and we're provided warm bread with olive oil. The wine list was very extensive-primarily bottles. I got a glass of the house red, which was a red blend. It was very smooth ($8). 

The menu includes a variety of salads, risottos, vegetarian options, pasta, pizza and Italian entrees. There is something for everyone. I ended up getting the veggie lasagna. It came out pipping hot. It took me a good 10 minutes to dig into it and it was worth it. The veggies were cooked perfect and it had great flavor. It also had a red sauce base, but I was expecting white. It was still good though. 

Three guests at our table got the spicy sausage penne and they all enjoyed it. Everyone said it was a tad spicier than they expected, but our waiter did warn them. My other friend got the seafood risotto and before I tried my food I regretted my decision. The risotto looked amazing. I tried a bite and the seafood was delicious and the risotto had a lemon flavor to it. Tasted light and refreshing. 

Overall I would return to Tavolo and I hope it succeeds as Uptown needed an Italian restaurant. I only wished they did some type of drink special during the week or half off wine night. There are no specials that I know of."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. The place is large and good for groups. There isn't a lot of ambiance and the lights were flickering which didn't really bother us. I ordered the zucchini for an appetizer and it was really good and followed that with a risotto which was good as well. The service was exceptional and our waitress was kind and attentive the whole time.

Overall I gave this place 4 stars because there was little ambiance and the food was good but not great. Again, service was exceptional."}
{"text":"My friend went for a dinner early on Friday night, we were seated right away, the restaurant was not very busy. We got mozzarella frittas to share, and they were delicious but nearly $12 for 4 servings total. We each had a glass of white wine and then I had the traditional risotto and added shrimp. My friend had the chicken Parmesan. She said the chicken was a little over done but the herb linguine it came with was delicious. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, glad I tried it but pretty sure I won't be back. I tried 2 appetizers that I didn't like (calamari & carpaccio). 1 was bad enough to send back. They didn't allow it. The manager never came over, they just told the waiter there's nothing they could do. Hostesses are unprofessional and bartenders aren't friendly. Maybe I wasn't welcome there. Anyway, the entree (risotto) was really good with lemon flavors. I guess if I'm with a group and they beg me to go I'll return and try a pizza (as if I can't get one from at least 3 other places within one block). This place took forever to open up just to be this underwhelming, it's unexpected, but the reality."}
{"text":"Amazing set up great bar for the solo traveler or large tables for the bigger groups! Wine list was extensive and the menu had something for everyone in the group."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a good review about this restaurant, but our experience was just horrible. They were obviously understaffed on a night while there was a huge concert in town. We had a 5:00 reservation and didn't even get a server to our table until 5:45. Our food came out cold. The manager was rude. They were out of wine and the food we wanted. They didn't have any toilet paper in the bathroom. The manager was rude. They didn't apologize or comp anything. In fact, the manager was rude to us. The waiter didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Super sauce (\"4-hour marinara\") provided the foundation for the outstanding Eggplant Parmigiano and Lasagna Bolognese dishes we enjoyed this evening. Coupled with the fresh-baked bread and great Caesar salad, it doesn't get any better than this. Responsive and friendly service from all. A wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I was excited to see what was here since there were good reviews and it looks nice. Lost 1 star automatically for 'being out' of the seafood risotto that my dad ordered. The oil given for the bread was meh, I would have much appreciated a nice clear oil with a side of parmesan cheese for the bread. The bread didn't taste like much, but was warm. My 8 year old daughter got spaghetti with parmesan and olive oil and she gave it 5 stars (picky eater, ate every bite). My carbonara risotto was good, needed something, maybe salt or extra parmesan (3 1/2 stars from me). My dad had to get mushroom risotto which was flavorful but he also said something missing (3 stars from him). Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I don't even know if this restaurant is open anymore. We were looking forward to trying out this restaurant  as their menu looks great. I made reservations well in advance for my husband and I for our anniversary last night . 

I have received no less than three text and email messages reminding me of our reservation. However, when we arrived the doors were locked and you could see the lights were off. We tried calling and the phone just rang with nobody picking up. 

I did indicate on our reservation that it was our anniversary so it is very disappointing that we weren't even notified in advance so we could make alternate plans. They state to contact them should our plans change, it would be nice if they treated others as they expect to be treated."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place since it opened and finally convinced a girlfriend to go on a girls' night with me here. We arrived around 6 on a Thursday and it was not very crowded inside. We were seated in a comfy corner in the raised seating area. The bar area and upstairs look like great places to throw a happy hour or party. Our waitress was very friendly and patiently answered all of our questions about the menu. We ordered wine and bruschetta as an appetizer and I ordered the ravioli and my friend ordered lasagna as entrees. The bruschetta was very good! It had a great balsamic on it and I really enjoyed the whole thing. Our pasta dishes were amazing. The ravioli, which is made in house with sun dried tomatoes and a creamy sauce, was probably the best ravioli I've ever had. I tried the lasagna and it was also very good. The meat sauce had a great spice to it and it was a big portion. We ordered tiramisu to share for dessert and it was huge. It was tasty but not the best I've ever had. It felt overall that even though this establishment is new they really have their stuff together. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I love what the people behind Tavolo have done to a popular spot in downtown Charlotte. Tavolo is now a chic, modern Italian restaurant in what use to be Cosmos. The space is large, the food I was able to sample was good , and it seems like it would be a great place to start the night out. It's not too loud, so you can still have a conversation if you visit with others. If visiting alone, they also have an awesome looking bar if you're interested. My favorite food item sampled was what I believe was a fried risotto. Coupled with a cold glass of white wine, this tasty appetizer was exactly what I needed after work that day. Seriously...I could have eaten about a dozen of them. Also note that they have weekly specials and parking nearby (hence a great place to start your night)."}
{"text":"Not certain why they're closed...maybe just making some needed improvements with staff. HOWEVER, MY experience while they were open...superb! They served a vegetable lasagna that makes you not care if you EVER have meat again. YUM!!! And the boo and I just moved literally 2 blocks from the place, so I was bummed to see they're temporarily closed. Hopefully opening again soon. Yummo from me Tavolo!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was extremely understaffed last night and entirely disorganized. The staff was polite and did the best they could. It appeared that the manager closed early to keep more customers from overwhelming the staff. 

They were out of tons of food and wine. The waitress recommendations for wine were twice as expensive as the one we ordered. 
 
Food was decent and I left perfectly satisfied but I really wouldn't want anyone to experience this. If I had come here for a special occasion it would have been very deflating. 

Some more pickier stuff was that they had track lighting directly in your eyes the whole time, and the AC was freezing. The dining is far from intimate. 

There was a concert in uptown which should have been a great night for them and it's very concerning they were not prepared. 

Fortunately I was with good friends and the experience was happy regardless."}
{"text":"Was really excited to experience the newly renovated Cosmos space and new restaurant with my SO for our rare date night.  The first thing that struck me was that they really didn't change much about the layout from COSMOS.  It's very big for an uptown restaurant, and the different sections and tables within each section are spread out too much and in an uncomfortable way.  The lighting is morgue horrible, with really cold blue almost flickering lights.  The service was pretty bad, too.  When my wife asked what was in a certain cocktail, the waiter asked what the menu said, and then proceeded to make sh!t up.  Finally, the service was slow, probably because most of the staff was congregated in pockets around the place having conversations."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent! I got the prosciutto and fig which sounds crazy but it was delicious and my date got the pepperoni pizza and he can't stop talking about it which made me want to write this review!  We will be back!  
Wait staff was super nice also!"}
{"text":"Pricey average food. Group of 4 and nobody's food was mind blowing. Bar actually made decent drink. Would I go back? Nah...."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was great.  Easy location to walk around Uptown and hit other bars/restaurants. Their sauce was a big hit with everyone. Sweet but not too sweet. Great night."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant - the ambience was chill, the service was wonderful, and the food was delicious.  Both dishes tasted extremely fresh - a veal Marsala and a pasta and bolognese sauce with a three meat meatball.  Wonderful cannoli, nice wine list, and a tasty chopped salad rounded out the meal."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for a birthday dinner date. Wine and cocktails were yummy. Had the arrancini appetizer (yum!) and the caprese salad. Salad was fresh but a little too salty. Husband had the chicken parm which he loved and I loved my saltimbocca entree. But what we really loved was dessert- homemade tiramisu and locally made espresso chocolate gelato. Both were YUMMY! Definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Old Cosmo's turned into an even better space! Great staff, marge bar and really great food. Mozzarella Frita, Bolognese and Canoli's are out of this world! GM Tony will make you feel like family when you walk in...new spot you must check out!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food yet, I've been waiting 40 minutes past pick up time. Update now that we've gotten food, great reviews on the ravioli and risotto(a bit skimpy on the shrimp;3) but the prosciutto fig pizza would have been better had at brixx next door."}
{"text":"I adore Tavolo so much that I had my wedding reception in the upstairs bar area so my entire family could enjoy it. Not only did we not have to pay a fee to rent the space (which was very kind and helped us a lot), but the staff and owner treated us like family. The food was absolutely delicious and they allowed us to bring decorations and our own cake. My favorites are of course, the bread with oil and seasonings (to die for!!), the chicken alfredo (so creamy and packed with flavor), and my all time favorite: The prosciutto and fig flatbread. The salads are great and the bruscetta is next level amazing! However, the combination of sweet and savory on the fig pizza packs a unique and incredible punch that makes it my all time favorite. I absolutely love this place and I could eat those fig pizzas everyday for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. Tavolo isn't just an Italian joint, it's a place for friends and family. It's a place of flavor, laughter, and memories. I would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We waited for 30 mins for our table to be waited on! After approach by the assistant general manger, the service did NOT CHANGE ! They did not accommodate us for the terrible service, and had us WAIT again just to tell us that they didn't want to do anything about it."}
{"text":"Prompt service and an excellent wine list. Kyle was very knowledgeable and made excellent suggestions. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tavolo is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. From custom and authentic Italian food, to divine hand crafted martinis (tiramisu martini tastes as delicious as it sounds) and an excellent wait staff and management team, my experience was nothing less than the best."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tavolo for Latin Night on Saturdays for a few weeks.  It is a very different experience compared to the typical (and fabulous) dining you might be used to here.  The ground floor is completely cleared and only a limited selection of drinks are available for purchase at the bar--beer, wine, liquor, and basic cocktails in small plastic cups.  Cover is $10 and people come for the dancing.

While the music starts at 10p, hardly anyone dances for the first hour.  There is a beginners salsa and bachata class at 10:30p.  About 15 or so minutes after class is over, people start dancing.  The DJ seems to go through cycles.  There will be a few salsa songs in a row, a group of bachata songs, several general latin club dancing songs, some merengue, etc.  So you don't have to get on/off the floor for one song--there are a few songs then you get tired and have a few songs to rest, regardless of what your dance groove is.

My only wish is that I could do a late dinner here and then transition into the dancing, rather than having to come on separate evenings.  I guess you can't have it all... on the same night."}
{"text":"The best cannoli in charlotte hands down.  Tony, the general manager, made the night extra special by making sure everything was perfect.  Wait staff and food presentation could not have been better.  My new favorite Italian restaurant in charlotte"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Charlotte. 

Being from the north I am pretty picky with pizza. And in Charlotte there just aren't many options for good pizza. Lots of \"chipotle style\" pizza but nothing authentic. Tavolo changed that with its wood fired oven. The crust is perfect and the margharita is a must. 

The cheesecake is phenomenal too. Staff is very friendly and I certainly love the addition to the north side of town. 

The wine loft area upstairs is incredibly unique and a great place to chill. Overall the decor is casual yet nice allowing the space to be approachable. Great Italian addition to uptown."}
{"text":"We came here after a recommendation from our hotel and we were not disapppointed. I had the sausage & penne and my wife had the arancini with vanilla cheesecake for dessert. All of it was delicious. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Came in here as it was on conveniently on the corner where my friend and I were trying to decide where to eat dinner. I'm new to Charlotte so didn't know this was a brand new place until we sat down at the bar and the bartender told us how new it was. My friend asked the bartender to make her a drink and he made a very refreshing cucumber cocktail. I just got a glass of wine. We got the arancini appetizer which came with 4 and was delicious! I got the prosciutto wrapped scallops that came with rice and my friend got the shrimp diavlo. Both were pretty amazing. The bartender, however, forgot to give us our bread halfway through the meal which was a little disappointing as it would've been nice while we were waiting for our food, but all in all it was very good and I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with our experience with Tavolo. We went into the city for a concert labor day weekend and knowing it would be busy I made a reservation at Tavolo for an hour before the concert. The spectrum center is right there and the headliner would go on later so I thought we had plenty of time. Boy was I wrong.

We showed up 15 minutes early for our reservation to a sign stating the bartender was seating people. So we queued up after a couple people and waited and then waited some more. Politely told the growing number of people behind us that yes we were in line. The line was at least twenty people all the way back to the door by the time the bartender pointed us to a table that had been open the whole time everyone was waiting.

We sat down and made our dinner choices and decided to skip the appetizers since we were sat late and the restaurant looked busy. We sat at our table a full 20 minutes after our reservation time before a waiter came to give us water. We had talked about going somewhere else during all the free time we had but being a holiday and a Sunday there weren't many options. Which was the reason I made reservations. None of the tables around us had food in the 35 minutes we had been in the restaurant. While I am glad the waiter was honest about it he said he couldn't get us out in the remaining 40 minutes we had. At that point we left and frantically ran around the city trying to find quick food. 

I have never seen such a disorganized restaurant and I doubt we will ever return."}

Did you know that this space used to be a bar called Cosmo for about 10 years before it was converted to a restaurant? Little piece of trivia that our server shared with us :)

I was looking to make dinner reservations for a large group from work and Tavolo fit perfectly for our group consisting vegetarians and vegans. I called in around 5 PM on a Tuesday evening and was able to get us a table for 7. When we got to the restaurant, our table was ready waiting for us. The space seemed huge and had a great open decor. Our server recommended a wine that we all loved, and they also had a decent cocktails menu and beer on tap. 
For the food we were served very warm bread with a delicious sundried tomato-thyme infused oil. We ordered quite a few entrees and though I did not try all I can safely say that the portion sizes are large. The vegetable lasagna, eggplant parm (Served on a bed of delicious garlicy linguine) and the sausage and penne were very satisfying. I would recommend Tavolo for big groups."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and top notch staff. Food was great, as was the atmosphere. Will come again next time in in North Carolina!"}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 - 3.7 ish....

After having been upstairs in the private event space for the Yelp Elite \"Yelp's Aperitivo at Tavolo\" event and the pizza samples disappeared before I got through the food sample line, I headed to the main level bar to finish my Gold Rush cocktail and order one of the tasty looking wood fired pizzas.

It took a while for the bartender to acknowledge me. I am one who feels I should not have to flag you down. You're the one working... Especially when I'm sitting right in front of you. Unacceptable. Maybe it was because I sat down with a cocktail already. Still shouldn't matter. Just check in on me anyway...

Finally after she recognized I was there, I ordered the Alfredo Rustica. Meanwhile, during that wood firing process, a friend at the bar had ordered a bowl of risotto and offered me a bite. Wow! So creamy and delicious! The ticket time on the pizza sure seemed longer than it should have. But, when it finally arrived I couldn't wait to dive in! Very rustic and alfredo-y. The entire pizza disappeared ... apparently into my belly. Ok, ok. I did share one piece. 

I helped wash down that delicious pie with an ice cold Giovanni's Revenge! My favorite, so far, on the specialty cocktail menu.

The aforementioned friend also saved me one bite of the homemade tiramisu. Not a fan of the typical tiramisu desert ... this I could go for! Again, I say Wow!

{"text":"Went here on my birthday and they made it a great experience. Food was great, service was great, and they gave me a piece of birthday cheesecake on the house. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food, so I took my wife here for our anniversary.  She remembered when it used to be Cosmo (which she loved), so she was curious as to how the new place was.  She had lasagna (which she thought was very good) and I had the Caesar Salad with Salmon (which I thought was very good).  The wait staff was pretty good, the atmosphere was great, and the prices couldn't be beaten.  We'll be stopping here regularly from now on."}
{"text":"Uptown for a show, reservations at 6pm, service was prompt and waitress was wonderful. Order calamari, very tasty and thought jalopeos were a great surprise. My wife order lagzgna  bolognese, ok but sauce was more of paste than a sauce. I ordered the sausage and penne, way too spicy and to my surprise again...jalopeos. way too many. 
Mouth was on fire and not from the sausages."}
{"text":"Tavolo did not hit high as one of preferred spots for Friday night dinner with friends for a few various reasons. Firstly, there were open tables in the restaurant, but since we were a party of five, the host staff was having some issues placing us. Not a problem- we went to bar. But, after again waiting another 40 minutes and noticing a four top table still being wide open we went up and asked them to pull a chair around for five. They did it, but why did we have to ask them? I would think they would give us possible options to begin with. Any who, the bread and oil were perfect starter- delicious! Sadly, my spinach salad with grilled shrimp added on top was a horrible excuse to grab a bowl of greens and slap three, tiny shrimp on top to call that dinner. I had to ask the waitress to bring me more cheese and dates because you literally could not see any in there. It wasn't appealing. My friend also had to asked the waitress about his drink since only mine was delivered. The check did not come out right at the end and I had to ask her to change it. Overall, poor experience for Uptown."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my daughter's birthday with a wonderful selection pout food.  The Bolognese sauce is absolutely the bestI have ever had! My son really loved the spicy penne.  No one was disappointed."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant was delicious, the waitress was very nice. The whole family was thrilled with the overall experience!"}
{"text":"I went to this spot on yesterday with a co-worker to take advantage of tapas and wine week. This place was really nice. It's pretty nice inside and everyone was very pleasant. Our waiter was great. He was attentive and checked on us just enough. Now the food... awesome! We both ordered mussels which were delicious. I also ordered the eggplant caprese. It was really good as well. Then we shared a calamari appetizer and the tiramisu. We really enjoyed this place. I recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Almost empty. Food gets a 1.5. Service a 2.5. Very small portions of processed food. Service was  nice but seemed like they wanted to be elsewhere. I'm fairly soon they will be.  Simply cannot  come back. So wanted it to be good. Extremely over priced for sub par food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with some work colleagues. Restaurant just opened a few days ago. It was pretty quiet - don't believe it has been discovered yet. Food and service were excellent - highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Restaurant \"Weak\"

A group of friends and I tried Tavolo for the first time this evening after having reviewed their menu for Charlotte's Queens Feast (aka Restaurant Week).

I typically start reviews with what I enjoyed most but on this occasion, there's nothing to rave over.

The main reason we selected this restaurant was for their clam linguini and the PEI mussels - but they were out of both on this second day of restaurant week.

The atmosphere was lackluster, the staff was wearing yoga clothes and Nike running shoes.

There were gnats swarming the table (see photos) and the marinara sauce made high school cafeteria food seem like high-end cuisine. 

I am embarrassed to have suggested my friends accompany me to this restaurant and will not return in future."}
{"text":"Visited Tavalo for a Where Magazine event. The venue space is beautiful. They have a traditional dining area on the first floor with bar and then  lounge-like area with a wine and cocktail bar on the 2nd floor-perfect for network mixers and happy hour. We sampled 2 pizzas , penne with meatballs ( the sauce was so yummy and a perfect consistency) and my absolutely favorite, arancini. I'd described them as mozzarella huspuppies ( it's OK to laugh) definitely a must-try. The manager Anthony was very nice and welcoming as was the rest of the staff. He even offered his card when I mentioned having my birthday celebration here. Added bonus during the week they have an Express lunch that is on average $10 with fries ( no drink because we'll have beer/wine later )  If you are staying in 1st ward Uptown Charlotte or near the Holiday Inn Express Uptown Charlotte, definitely stop by and enjoy some well-mad Italian food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! Best Italian food I've had since moving to Charlotte. If you live in Charlotte or are planning to visit, you NEED to go"}
{"text":"We had no trouble getting in and seated without a reservation.  Here is why the two stars... Our waitress brought our bottle of wine to the table and seemingly had no experience with how to serve it properly.  She left the metal cork covering in place after popping the cork which gave the wine a metallic taste as it passed over the metal shards when pouring it in our glasses.  Our pasta was great, but the tomato sauce that covered it tasted canned and void of Italian flavors such as basil and oregano.  We ordered dessert, a very small menu, and were told the \"ice cream\" may or may not be available.  First, Italians call it gelato not ice cream.  We ordered a latte and they had no idea how to make it.  It took several people around the machine and lots of giggles to make something vaguely resembling a cappuccino.  OH, and they served it in a COFFEE MUG.  I was SHOCKED!  Spend the money on mugs meant for cappuccino and other Italian coffee drinks!!  Lastly, the spoon that came with the dessert items was so big it was hard to actually eat the dessert.  They were too big and not appropriate for the course.  Soup spoons will never be an acceptable substitute for dessert spoons.  I just felt like they are making cheap decisions and not being authentic.  They need to train their staff on how to properly serve meals, especially wine.  We both left feeling as though we had just eaten at an Olive Garden chain restaurant.  Do better guys, if you wanna stick around!  I would also recommend adding affogato to your dessert menu.  It's simple, delicious and authentic.  Just don't serve it in a coffee mug!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed. My boyfriend and I split the chopped salad and spaghetti and meatball. The salad had no flavor at all at the meatball was tiny. Overall I could have made the entire meal better myself for less money."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated Italian restaurants I've been to in Charlotte! Food is delicious, decently priced and huge portions!"}
{"text":"Love this new place! Beautiful decor and atmosphere, very diversified menu with a lot of cool options. Our server Stephen was awesome and very attentive. I had the eggplant Parm pasta and my wife had the Shrimp fadiavolo, both had a caesar salad, everything tasted amazing. For a new place, I am very impressed at the quality of the food and service, you get the feel that they got their act together and know what they are doing. 
We'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this new restaurant and finally had a chance this week. Met a friend for cocktails around 6pm and initially the service was ok.  Cocktails menu was great, half price happy hour, and I tried a few. All were tasty and my favorite was the Che Figata. We decided to eat at the bar and placed our orders for pizza and vegetarian lasagna.  While placing the order my friend had a conversation with the bartender both teasing me about being a vegetarian (all in good fun). I was away when my food arrived and noticed that I did not have any flatware.  Tried to get the bartender's attention for a bit but he was talking to someone at the other end of the bar so I walked over to ask for that and more water.  Two bites into my food I realized that I had been served the meat lasagna.  Again tried to get the bartender's attention and finally waved at the guy he was talking to and he pointed him in our direction.  Note: There were only three of us sitting at the bar (my friend/ myself and the guy at the other end) so it was not a busy night. When I very nicely explained the issue there was no apology at all and he kind of chuckled and walked off.  I waved him down again and ask that the veggie lasagna be packed to go because it was past 10pm and my friend had finished her dinner.  When the bill arrived my friend asked why there was no discount of any kind for the mix up. The guy said he didn't charge us for the meat lasagna and didn't seem to understand the issue (we were charged full price for the lasagna that was now packed to go).   I hate to give a review on cold leftovers but the lasagna was ok the next day.  I've seen quite a few reviews for this restaurant with low stars based the staff and not the food.  I hope management works on improving this issue.  Even with the mix up, a different attitude from the bartender would have made all of the difference in my review."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst customer experiences I've had! We had a group for a friend's birthday, about 6 of us. After seated we waited for a few then our appetizer order was taken, it took a bit but not out of the ordinary. Then we waited quite a while longer before our order was taken, the assistant manager came to check on us and we explained our food was taking a long time and the drink of my friend never came. A while after they starting bringing food, my soup was wrong also. The food was good and the location nice, but the service was horrible. 
We waited some more, then a deferent server asked if we needed boxes and he brought us some. We still waiting for our check about 15 min later our server asks if we need our checks! After finally getting the check, they added 20% gratuity, which explains why our service was awful, since the tip was already included! 
We asked for a manager and both of them basically have the worst customer service attitude. Obviously they didn't care of our complain of how long the food took and the poor service. The assistant manager returned and said they couldn't do anything without \"evidence.\" After multiple back and forth , due to mentioning the bad reviews on yelp, he said he would be back. After about 20 more minutes..... he said they agreed to take off the 20% gratuity off for us and \"they will pay it out of their pocket. \" no apology, not a care in the world that we would never come back. No wonder their service is awful, it's obvious the managers set the standards with their example. Needless to say, I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Amazing food, every time we dine here we leave happy and full. We also choose this location for our private dinner with 20 people they  were so easy to work with and extremely accommodating I would recommend Tavolo for an amazing dinner or an big event. Thank you  for making out dinner amazing everyone loved it"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and the atmosphere was nice, if a little bit loud. A nice conversation could still be had though, so all was good. The wait staff was attentive and the food was good. Not remarkable, but was very solid. As I used to enjoy Cosmos, I was hoping for something spectacular but it was still good enough and the price point was very affordable. I would definitely eat here again and I would recommend people try it."}
