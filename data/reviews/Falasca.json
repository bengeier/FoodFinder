{"text":"SOUP NAZI

FYI I HAVE A RECORDING OF THIS ENCOUNTER. I will post a link as soon as I can.          

let me start by saying  that I am a big fan of independent small businesses, and I am by no means a \"diva\" when it comes to my expectations at hotels, restaurants, etc.
For the most part I enjoy pubs when I am looking for an night out. That being said, there is a certain level of service I expect when spending my hard earned dollar at a restaurant. This evening I attended this establishment solely for the benefit of my girlfriend, who happens to enjoy quality pizza made in the old world tradition. We have dined in this restaurant on several occasions and have found the food to be quite good. Tonight however we arrived to find a half empty restaurant (only 4 of the 12 or so tables were occupied). Given that the place was relatively empty we asked to be moved to a table in the back and were greeted with  rolled eyes. The waitress did accommodate us however she made it clear through her body language that were were being difficult. Once seated we both acknowledged that our reception was less than warm (I was glad that it wasn't just me being difficult). After a long but not unacceptably long wait we were given menus and offered drinks. We ordered drinks and conversed for a while before our order were taken. We (she) ordered a pizza and I (we) ordered an appetizer that was a breaded rice ball. We have had this appetizer on several occasions and every time we asked for a side of marinara or pizza sauce in order to add a little \"zest\" to it. Tonight, however the waitress said that she could not accommodate us. I thought that perhaps thee was no marinara sauce so I asked for a bit of pizza sauce instead. The waitress looked stressed and said she would see about it. She returned a few mins later and said that she \"Couldn't\" give us a dip. Thinking that the issue was money, I said that I was willing to pay for the side of sauce. She said that she couldn't grant my request because her boss would \"get mad\" If she gave me a side of sauce. Incensed, I walked to the entrance to the kitchen and asked to speak to the owner or manager. I was informed that the cook was the owner and he spoke with me briefly, he said that \"sauce doesn't go with (the rice ball)\". I said that I understand his position, however I stated that I had had this particular dish before and enjoyed it with a side of marinara\". He again insisted that he could not grant my wish. I pointed to a large pot of pizza sauce and said that I would be happy with a bit of that. He again insisted that he couldn't give me sauce because it \"doesn't go with that\". At this point I asked for my bill and said that I would pay for my drinks and the rice ball. I walked to the front entrance and was given my bill by the waitress who seemed to agree with me by stating \"I understand but, you know, they're Italian\".
I paid my bill and left.
I am a very good customer and I am more likely to speak to the manager about what was good about my experience rather than complain. I just felt really put off by this experience and would like to let other people know about what to expect when going to this restaurant. It felt very \"soup Nazi\"."}
{"text":"Great and authentic pizza , I have been there. 5 times and every time the service is average ... Very average."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Was really looking forward to this place as I've passed it many times but never been in.

Went in with my wife as a bit of a Friday night date and was not the romantic location.  We were seated in the middle of a number of young families with kids screaming, crying and running around (Kind of like a McDonalds play land).  This combined with the loud music made it really hard to even speak to each other.  So not a good start.

Food wise we had the tomato bruschetta and prosciutto bruschetta both on burnt toast.  Then the very generously portioned caprese salad let us down with a significantly bland flavour.

Still holding out hope my pizza arrive! Toppings were again generous (prosciutto and mushrooms) but with the first bite my hope was dashed due to a horrible tomorrow sauce.  It tasted like a very cheap canned sauce that just over powered any flavour or the pizza.  If they had just taken the time to make their own sauce fresh this would have been a very different review and I would be a regular, but cutting corners shows.

My wife had the spaghetti carbonara that was a small portion, too much egg and fake Parmesan cheese.  Another disappointment.

Guess my search continues for good pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place not only serves the kind of pizza that allows your senses to trick you into thinking that you are sitting in an authentic Italian restaurant, but the staff and atmosphere is that of a true Italian family home. That is to say, it's warm, inviting and cheerful.
I have tried both their lunch time pizza, which is on a thicker crust and sold by the weight, as well as their evening pizza which has the authentic Napolena crust. As someone who loves pizza, and especially craved it and carbs during my pregnancy, I can say (without a doubt) that this is the best crust in the city. Pizza Libretto is a close second, followed by Queen Margherita, but nothing touches the Falasca dough. 
I have also tried their Arancini, which is large and served with ample sauce, unlike the dried out rice balls that I was fed at GUSTO a few weeks ago. Also, I have tried several of their pastas and they were all amazing. The prices are reasonable and it's definitely well suited for groups, families and intimate date nights."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in midtown Toronto. Service can be slow, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the city! I felt like I was back in Italy--authentic and divine!"}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing staff! This is as close to Roman pizza as you can get this side of the Atlantic, including the custom of serving pizza by weight for lunch (I haven't tried that yet) and the round thin crust pizza in the evening. 
They import most of the ingredients from Italy so everything just tastes authentic. Make sure you try some of the imported wines. I tried the penne all'arrabiata and the mushroom pizza, both excellent. Oh and the chocolate mousse was really great, chocolatey and not too sweet."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing!  This is real authentic Italian pizza right near yonge and eglinton.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I just got (and finished) two whole pizzas: the funghi and prosciutto, and the spicy salami. The Funghi was OK but nothing amazing, and the salami was really good. I do like the dough (very thin and just a bit crunchy) and cheese a lot, and the sauce on the salami was just right. But I do take issue with the price: $30.17 for two pizzas which are very thin and small. Plus, I got a can of coke and Alessandro just said \"let's make it a round $33\". $2.83 for a can of coke? Are you serious? As much as I like Alessandro (the owner), the pizza, and the Gelato across the street (Alessandro's first shop), this was just pushing it. But I will go back to it, just not that frequently."}
{"text":"Haven't been here yet, but my husband spent $27 for two lil' takeout pizzas.  The crust was really good, but there was barely a suggestion of cheese on either, and after a forty minute wait, they were stone cold.  May just be the opening jitters, so I'll wait a while to try again."}
{"text":"Pizza is truly authentic to Roman style pizza. They have both round pizza and pizza slices \"pizza al taglio\". The sliced pizza is only during the day for take out or stand up and the rounds for dinner.  This is not napoletana style pizza. It is very different in style. I can go on forever trying to explain it, so your better of going during the day for the thicker square pizza (my favorite) or the rounds at night to judge it yourself"}
{"text":"Just came back from a late dinner with my wife. Wasn't very busy so the service was top notch and the food came out quickly. bruschetta was good (but a little on the expensive side) and my rice ball was less then average. Pizza was the salmone with aged and fresh mozzarella. Very, very good. Better then both Liberettos. Would go again."}
{"text":"After returning from Rome and fell in love with their pizzas I was determined to find something similar in Toronto.  I searched on yelp and finally came across to this restaurant which looked like they make similar pizzas and I was super excited to try it out.  

I happened to be around yonge and Eglinton area and decided to try it out one night.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed because the pizzas were not the way I imagined it to be. I ordered one white and one red.  The red one was artichoke with egg and the white one was mushroom, sausage, with fiore latte mozzarella.  I had the exact same artichoke with egg in Rome so I thought I could really compare the taste.  However, the pizzas here can't really compare to the way it was made in Rome.  The ones I ate here were pretty bland in taste and were some what soggy. Too much liquid coming from either the sauce or the mushrooms so that was a bummer.  Secondly, the ingredients were really bland, the sausages tasted like cooked ground pork without any seasoning and I expected the egg cooked along with the pizza but it looked like it was thrown on after the Pizza was cooked.  The portion size was decent but just lacking the taste.

The restaurant did offer other items in their menu and it seemed like a busy restaurant but I didn't have a chance to try them out as I was in the market to find the ultimate pizza joint.  Maybe better luck for me next time"}
{"text":"Our year here is coming to an end; we're about to move back to NY. Of the many things in Toronto that we'll miss, at the top of the list is Falasca--the terrific pizzas and pastas, and the warm and unpretentious service. In our humble opinion, it surpasses either Libretto. We'd love to have its equivalent in our neighborhood at home. It will definitely be on the itinerary when we come back to Toronto for visits!"}
{"text":"Just tasted pasta, it's excellent. And thought it's a pizza outlet !"}
{"text":"This placed has morphed just a bit from the old Falasca. Same Roman style pies, better service now. I think the new name is Quattro e Quattr8. 

I had a fairly large arugula, pear, parmesan salad with a good oil and lemon dressing along with a slice of pancetta y patata pizza blanco for $11. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for a reasonable and delicious Italian lunch. They offer a range of tasty pizza options and also really beautiful pasta dishes. I've never been for dinner, but from what I've seen, it's quite a bit more expensive in that regard. I've been here at least 15 times over the past few years and can't remember ever being disappointed."}
{"text":"Falasca is part of \"my 5 Stars\" because they do make a decent Roman Style pizza at a good price. Well, they actually make the two kinds of  pizzas I can find in Rome. \"Pizza al Taglio\", the pizza usually sold in bakeries by the weight and is a typical street food,. With a pop makes a very good lunch. Then, The usual 12\" dinner pizza, the popular paper-thin crunchy Roman pizza with the topping reaching the edge. Wish they had a wood-burning oven.

I was used to go with my friend for pizza in Rome and having 2 or 3 of dinner pizzas just for myself. Light as a feather it would never fill up my stomach.

I miss my Dolce Vita, but life can be as sweet in TO as is in Italy... well...the weather needs a little help..."}
{"text":"This isn't an ordinary pizza place, it is a nice small authentic pizza place which is not too pricy either. Great flavors and variety."}
{"text":"For lunch time slices - I like the pay-by-weight, the committed service and the commendable range of authentic pizza choices.

Flip side, I think if you hit off-peak you can't really expect that many slice choices, and they have lost their oven-fresh charm even when dutifully reheated to a proper temp and a slightly undesirable crunch. I'm a fresh pizza freak and North of Brooklyn does that fresh chewy-tender slices thing much better all day. Falasca has also some typical Italian slices that are bland without some wine or maybe fresh tomato/garlic sautee over it to accent - a bit rustic and crying out for some added flavor.

Falasca is good as expected, very sweet counter lady. Go now. If you need serious protein as well go round the corner to Boar."}
{"text":"Not too bad for midtown. I think the wine is a bit overpriced at  approximately 12 dollars for 6oz. I had a Peroni instead which was reasonably prices and tasty. 

I ordered the mushroom and prosciutto pizza which was lovely but the crust was burnt around the edges. The restaurant was quite empty so I'm not sure how my pizza burnt lol

Overall the service was great."}
{"text":"Terroni vs Falasco vs Libretto 

What do you think? I like it more than Terroni, partly because they'll let you make a substitution, and partly because the toppings I've had are amazing- the Parmagiano with Eggplant is my favorite and I've been there twice and ordered it both times. 
I don't like it quite as much as Libretto because the space is very loud, and a little stark with bright white walls and lights everywhere. There are also flies everytime I've been and the smell of burnt crust.  My crust always tastes amazing, but the smell is a little smoky."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only.
Setup is nice and clean and there is small dinning area. Plenty of pasta dishes on offer but pizza seems to be there forte'. I decided to stick with a classic and went with a Margherita dinning companions order a prosciutto in addition to a Margherita. The order was ready quite fast in the meantime there was a steady stream of regulars.
Prices seem reasonable for what they were offering. On to the pizza the crust is nice and thin. Sauce was also delicate so far so good. The cheese was amiss IMO and what about the basil leaf? nope not on this one.  Decent version of this type of pizza. I would say 3 stars and would try it again if I am in the area and in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"I love Falasca pizza!!  It is truly unique and authentic.  They are always consistent and never disappoint.  The crust is super thin, one of the thinnest in the city, and full of flavour.  The ingredients are simple and minimal, which make it so devine.  Its priced very well too, which is a bonus. It's so much better than Viva Napoli, which is way over priced.  The service is always good, and prompt.  They only serve house wine, which makes things easy (when you struggle with decisons like I do). The wine is well priced as well.  I wouldn't reccommend the pasta - but this is a pizza review anyway - so stick with the pizza.  Parmigiana is my favourte one.  One thing to note, go there for dinner.  At lunch they weigh the slices, so its more expensive."}
{"text":"Falasca is not pretentious, kind of like a cafeteria feel, but the food is amazing. And by food im referring to their pizzas....they come out so quickly and they're delicious!! I have also tried the potato croquettes they were good too. The staff is very friendly...
I came here once in the afternoon and the dining area was closed..so you might want to check their hours before coming..."}
{"text":"Extremely thin crust pizza (the thinnest i've ever had) with yummy toppings. 

I had the Funghi Proscuitto and it was the perfect size for 1 person (Me!). I really liked the thin crust here @ Falasca. 
Good service- the server was attentive, friendly and nice. We went on a night when there were just too many crying screaming kids but it wasn't anything the restaurant could really do about that. 

Prices, i thought were fairly reasonable. 
This isn't Pizza Pizza, folks. And honestly, my 1 and only experience at Pizza Pizza was NOT cheap ($10++)  and the quality was Disgustingly Awful. I'd rather pay a couple of dollars more for good quality, healthy options here. $14 for a pizza here is fine; and no one needs to have 2 pizzas to satisfy themselves, Please!

I've been to LIbertto and although I do like the innovative toppings, didn't think it was So amazing that i'd stand in line for an hour again. 
 
I'll come back to Falasca! A great pizza/ dinner option @ Yonge & Eglinton"}
{"text":"The pizzas are phenomenal and there is always a great variety.  I love the brie and zucchini .

I got the Arancini once - they were good, but unfortunately the inside was cold. 

Great for eating in or taking out"}
{"text":"Your resident 'za expert/lover/religious follower here! I'm generally a VPN girl (i.e. no stranger to floppy pies) but I'd heard good things about Falasca, so I came for supper on a sweltering evening. They were serving their dinnertime thinner round pizzas (the \"R\" in S.P.Q.R., which stands for Specialità Pizza Quadrata Rotonda - now you know).

I tried the Salmone (Scamorza cheese, fior di latte, smoked salmon and arugula, $13.75) and the Quattro Formaggi (also $13.75), both of which were too salty and fell apart immediately. They were still good, but the cheese consistency (note: I'm also your resident fromage expert/lover/religious follower) was very weird. Bouncy and squeaky and so rubbery. I've never met a cheese I didn't like, but I wasn't totally into this. I don't think I've ever said that about a pizza before so I'm pretty much questioning everything I've ever known right now and wearing a tin foil hat.

We also had an unremarkable house wine and another member of our party ordered a red pizza that she enjoyed.

Reviews are so positive that if I'm in the neighbourhood again during lunch hours I'll totally give it another shot with the \"Q\" pies (the al taglio dough is sturdier), but my dinner experience was average."}
{"text":"What a little gem!
In love with the simplicity, quality rich ingredients; we gorged ourselves on plates of delicious, fresh appetizers: bruschetta pomodoro, bruschetta prosciutto (omg so good) & arrancini. 
When my pizza (prosciutto) arrived, I could only eat 1 heavenly slice & took the rest home.
This spot is truly authentic - one of the closest experiences I've ever had to the real, Italiano, deal ;)
FYI - for whatever reason, it is so loud here! 
I made reservations, but I don't know that it was necessary."}
{"text":"Superb crunchy crust is the main attraction that's thick but nicely crisp. Love the choices and especially the spicy chilli cherry tomato!  Sommany choices as well, and can order as many variety and size as desired."}
{"text":"I have become addicted to this cheap eats (~$5-$6). I absolutely adore the prosciutto pizza! 

For the uninitiated, they sell the pizza by the weight. It does not come in the triangular shape us peasants know. You indicate how much of the square you want and it gets weighted. It is then re-heated in the oven. I am a naive, innocent foodie so I am assuming this is fresh made pizza. Once ready, it's served to you to enjoy. It's absolutely delicious.

If you're a peasant like me and want to learn how to order in this place, the current server behind the counter has no time for your peasantry foolishness. Come prepared. Memorize my review and make no mistakes. I am lucky to carry cash, but some poor schmuck was wanting to pay with debit and was rejected. Debit is only allowed for $10+ expenses."}
{"text":"We tried it tonight.  

Felt like we were in Italy.   Great appetizers.   Delicious wine.  And then the pizza.  

We tried one white pizza and one traditional and they both hit the ball out of the park.  We will be back to try more of the great pies that this place has to offer.  

Yumm"}
{"text":"I won't engage in the debate about whether this is or isn't \"authentic\" Roman food. I know it was good - very, very good in fact. We joined friends who had been before and recommended the place. 

We started with the Caprese di Bufala. A fine, relatively healthy beginning to a meal that would go on to have its share of less than heart-healthy options.

That's partly because we also ordered fried tomato rice balls with mozzarella. Now there was no turning back.

My wife ordered the Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe, a simple rustic dish of spaghetti, cheese and black pepper. The server warned her that some people found it too salty. As if.

I had the pizza reale - smoked mozzarella, fior di latte, black truffle, porcini mushrooms and parsley. Slightly larger than what I would normally consume myself, it came with a sheen of oil on the top. Visually, it was a little off-putting. However, my tastebuds didn't object, and so neither did I. 

Our friends also split a pizza and a pasta dish. Everything was truly delicious.

If you're drinking wine, bear in mind that it's probably cheaper to share a bottle than to order multiple glasses.

The service was deliberately slow, encouraging diners to linger. We'll definitely give it another try, perhaps even for lunch, when the pizza is sold by weight (the food's, not the patrons', thank goodness)."}
{"text":"Fabulous. We need more restaurants like this in Toronto.  They place does authentic pizza right. Sauces and doughs are homemade- just as it should be and there are plenty of original selections when it comes to toppings. The only problem with their dinner menu is portion size (at least when it comes to pizza) but that's probably better anyway since pizza isn't healthy anyway."}
{"text":"Wandering in the neighbourhood found this place and tried it for dinner.  Was very disappointed.  
Appetizer tomato bruschetta was not fresh enough for an Italian restaurant.  An unimpressive mixed-greens salad lacking dressing.  Finally a Diavola spicy salami pizza that was unsliced, served with a butter knife (at least I got a workout slicing the damn thing), soggy, and except for the salami... Bland and boring.  I was hoping the pizza would truly be like that served in Italy and it was very very different.
Service started off slowly but the young lady taking care of us was very friendly.
The wine was forgettable but not bad.
I won't be coming back sadly."}
{"text":"Falasca has it all.  At lunch, you can choose from a variety of awesome ready-made pizzas.  Your piece is cut as large as you like, and you pay by weight, which means you can sample a few of them if you want.

Dinner is bright, lively, and casual (not your traditional dark candle-lit Italian dining room).  A choice of a few types of bruschetta and two types of rice balls dominate the appetizer menu.  Dinner is largely pizzas but there are always a few pasta specials.  Thursday is gnocchi night, when any of the pasta specials can be made as gnocchi.

They have a couple of desserts each night, but you also have the option of going directly across the street to the awesome gelato shop, which is owned by the same person as Falasca.

Prices are very reasonable - a glass of house wine each, a rice ball each, two pizzas, and a shared dessert for $60 + tip."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Saturday with a pal. It's cafeteria-style where you order, pay, and then find a seat (and then repeat?).There's a menu with pastas and salads posted by the door, but you can also order slices of pre-made pizzas. 

My pal and I decided to order slices of a few types of pizza - you pay by weight so you choose how big a slice you want. I really liked the variety of pizzas on the menu. Both types I ordered were winners (see my photo). Considering you get gourmet pizza, pricing wasn't outrageous.

The decor of this place is quite nice. It's simple with white walls and black-and-white photographs around the dining area. Italian radio playing in the background is a nice touch. 

Would love to return to try other menu items. I should mention that they do not accept credit card for orders less than $10.

Good for: pizza, lunch, dinner"}
{"text":"Good pizza.
Not better that Queen Margarita or Liberto, but well one its way to compete in the future.

Since opening, they are figuring out their kinks.

The place does make good pizza's. Everything is fresh and top quality. It's fairly expensive at around $13 a pizza (of which anyone could eat two).

Nice touch was to give us a dessert on the house (and the waiter reminded us we didn't have to go accross the street to the gelato place for dessert, and he could say it because the owner owns both places).

I think all in all, the place needs to be tweaked. The inside needs an AC if they are goign to survive the summer. The menu is good, but they need to wrap things up to offer value to customers (like Queen margarita's pre fix menu for $25). 

But food quality and taste wise, they are doing a good job and it's not bad to have a napoleanite pizza place in the north."}
{"text":"Yes, Falasca closed a few months ago, but the same guy, Allesandro, has opened Quattro e Quattr8 in the same location.  Same great square pizza.  Lovely Italian food.  Warmer surroundings.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Only tried the margarita for lunch, loved the concept of serving by weight. Would gladly go back, want to go for dinner to try out some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with a very romantic ambience. The arancini appetizer was large and filling. The pizzas were fresh tasting. The service was great. The conversation was going so well that we ended up staying after the restaurant had closed and they let us stay as they were eating their own meal. It felt like a real family restaurant, like we were a part of their home. I'll have to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza at its finest.  Both times I ordered takeout pizza and both times they were so delicious.  I just finished the parmigiana pizza.  I meant to take a picture of it but it was so good I forgot!  I also met Falasca himself as my pizza baked.  What a gentleman!  Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! 

I lived in Rome for three years, and right near my apartment there was an incredible pizza al taglio (by the slice) joint called \"Da Simone\" (Via Carini). When I moved to Canada, Simone is what I missed most about Rome.

Let me tell you, this place is as close to Simone as I imagine I'll ever get in Canada. They have the same style of service: line up at the counter, order your pizza based on weight (min. 100 gr), choose from the handful of flavors they have on hand for that day/hour. The best part about doing it that way is that you can try small pieces of several varieties, rather than having one personal pizza. 

The crust is thicker and crispier than a Napoletano style pizza - it's truly Roman. They also have Roman pasta specials such as Buccatini Alla Matriciana and Carbonara. I haven't tried them, but I trust they are amazing.

I had the spicy tomato pizza with mozzarella, and the mozzarella, sausage and black truffle oil pizza. Both were delicious, as was my Suppli (fried risotto ball with cheese center). A table across from us ordered the arancini, which looked awesome, too. 

Others at my table had the arugula and pear salad, a few other pizza choices, and the ravioli. Everyone love their meals. 

I definitely plan to return for lunch, as this place is close to my work. I can't speak for dinner -- it appears based on the reviews it's different from lunch, but I can't imagine it's not great. These people are straight outta Italy, and their gelateria across the street is amazing, too!

So, andiamo a mangiare... or as they say in Rome 'nnamo a magna'!"}
{"text":"Been in three times for pizza al taglio at lunch - twice for take-out and once we sat down. It's so reminiscent of Rome and I loved being able to split a few different types of pizza. Great arancini and all the pizze I've tried were amazing - sausage, truffle and cheese; zucchini and cheses; tuna and onion; rucola, pomodorini and mozzarella di buffala. Can't wait to taste the suppli' and check it out at dinner time!"}
{"text":"Went to Falasca authentic Italian pizza eatery yesterday evening. Its in my neighbourhood, on a nice strip of Yonge St between Davisville and Eglinton. Got there at 8pm on a Thu, about half the tables were full. There were two young servers. I started with a rice ball, no meat in it, just rice in a crisp golden fried coating. It was very good. Very salty. Shared it with my dinner companion, might have been too salty to eat a whole one on my own. We then shared the arugala salad with capers, olives, tomatoes, and little balls of white cheese. It was good, looked beautiful, all of the ingredients were very fresh, not a brown or withered leaf in the bunch. For mains we had a marinara pizza, just a generous amount of their marinara sauce and thinly sliced cloves of garlic. I thought it was very good, my guest found it to be unbearably salty. We also had the pizza with prosciutto, cheese, mushrooms, and tomatoe sauce. It was very good. All pizzas are restaurant style very thin crust and all creations look authentically Italian. Also had a pear nectar juice which was delicious. Bill came to $45 with tax, before tip. Kind of steep considering we didn't order any alcohol. The pizzas were $10 for the marinara, $14 for the prosciutto one. I think the rice ball was like $4, the salad a hefty $10, and pear nectar $3. Nice place, will be nice when the weather permits opening up the wall of windows to the sidewalk. I like that they have wooden benches storefront. Downside: too expensive.
Oh, and the server didn't even tell us that they had a pasta selection of about half a dozen choices which aren't on the menu, they're on chalkboards in the dining area. I only realized because I saw another table eating pasta, just noodles and marinara sauce, but I saw other items on the board."}
{"text":"The Roman-style pizzeria is a decent alternative to Toronto's Neapolitan-style fad. The dough is thin crust with a soft and chewy consistency, much like a New York-style pizza. Their tomato sauce was very good. It tasted fresh and a bit tangy. I would have liked a higher topping to crust flavour ratio and by that I mean more cheese, more sauce. I stupidly forwent the waitress's wine suggestions and picked Castello from the Birra list. Italians should stick to making wine. I didn't think there was anything worse than Peroni before I had Castello.

They sell pizzas by the slice, priced by weight, and have a great looking dining area for casual dining. I should also point out that they do other dishes besides pizzas. For instance, they have a specials menu for pastas and lots of enticing appetizers and desserts. I give them 4 stars even though I had a 3 star experience. I think this is a relatively fresh concept and I look forward to giving them another try."}
{"text":"Falasca is in a very bright, well organized space. The specials for pasta and pizza changes regularly.

We ordered:

Arrancci - good saffron flavour 
Telepone - mass of rice, ok 

Average  appetizers, fresh ingredient however I wish I had something to dip these fried batter balls into. I asked for marinara sauce. They had none.

House salad - large, fresh arugula with chopped mushrooms and a lemon vinaigrette. I would share next time

Capricsssa pizza - thin crust well topped pie that I wish was cut. It was 

The service was clumsy and I felt lucky to be eating with only a few fellow patrons.
Total for two with tax&tip: $80"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA, SALAD, PASTA EVER!!!! 

Try the Matteo or the Parma pizza's or the Parmagiano! 

I don't know, but when they guy making them is from Rome, like Italy, it's like duh!!

You will not be disappointed. Even the house wine is beautiful. 

Cheap, cheerful."}
{"text":"Falasca!  Mama Mia!  Pizza!  Pancetta!  Moooozarell'!

(all of the Italian words I know - minus hand gestures and expressions of frustration, which I use exclusively during the Word Cup games - are food related.  And for good reason!)

Felasca is a great Midtown spot.  Worth mentioning: have only been here for lunch, where there is a presented array of pizzas that you pay for by weight.  This approach is good for the culinarily indecisive (see: me).  For $9 I walked away with a sampling of white pizza,  pizza with tomato sauce and sausage, and (my favourite) featuring cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and arugula.  I split the amount with a friend, and it was the perfect amount of pizza to not have us snoozing at our desks into the afternoon...

The toppings are high quality, the crust was top-notch in my book (on the thin side, but still...erm...hoping this is the right word choice...toothsome?), and - though this has no impact on the taste buds - I really like the store design/logo.  There's nothing like stepping out into the sun with a good lookin' pizza box filled with yumminess (not a technical culinary term) and carrying it to the nearest patch of grass for an alfresco* picnic. 

Yelp note: judging by the line-up: this is a popular Midtown lunch spot.  Plan accordingly.

*Italian word, score!"}
{"text":"Truly fantastic pizza.  The best I have had in the city and, as others have remarked, very reminiscent of the experience I have had when I've been in Italy.  Get a few different small slices as you pay by weight. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto hands down. The pizza is a thin crust, and very crispy. The pasta is made in house, and is very good. Salads are simple, and tasty, usually the dressing is made with olive oil, and lemon. They use simple ingredients, and the food is simple and good."}
