{"text":"BEST happy hour in Vegas!! $3 for a pint of blue moon (and they have a selection of beer) $5 martini (totally delicious) and their appetizers like Jamaican jerk chicken, empanadas and burger sliders are around $5 as well.  A definite must-try if you've never been!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and awesome bar tenders. I'm here for a couple weeks for work and they have been great. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 30 on 6/27 and they were able to accommodate us as a normal reservation. Drinks and food were great! I had a bahama mama drink and was so tasty. Ordered the calypso pasta with shrimp and it was the best tasting shrimp pasta I've ever had even my 3 year old chowed it down. Thank you for your great hospitality and service."}
{"text":"We went to Bahama Breeze to celebrate my Son and Daughter both completing their college degrees. The food was great,  as we're the cocktails,  but the highlight of the night was our server,  Tamikah.  She made our special event even more special.  One of our party has dietary restrictions,  and Tamikah worked with the manager to make sure her dinner was perfect,  and it was.  We were a large party (9) people,  and each one of us we're completely happy with our meal and the evening.  We are now fans of Bahama Breeze and of Tamikah!"}
{"text":"Dennis was an exceptional waiter. 
Coconut Shrimp (6) for an appetizer was a great recommendation. Ordered dessert too and went with the warm upside down pineapple cake, so make sure you leave room for it!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place,here for fish tacos, they were very good 
Been here several times and would come here again,they have patio seating if you prefer  to eat outside."}
{"text":"Usually we are pleased with Bahama Breeze. ..However we made reservations a week and a half ahead of time for a going away party and when we show up  early for our time slot and are still standing waiting 40 minutes passed the time the only response we got from an employee when we asked what the hold up is was...\"Obviously we get a lot of reservations here! \" very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday for mothers birthday had such a great time minus some waiting but we caught happy hour was amazing Steven was awesome thanks for your services!!,"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch on a gift card we got for Christmas.  Probably one of the best chain restaurants in have ate at. Our waitress [Ashley] was extremely nice and helpful. She was busy but prompt with our table and several others around us. My wife ordered a mixed drink and it was delicious, the food was great and portioned well for the cost. We will be visiting here again."}
{"text":"We went there for my brother's birthday. Our waitress was great. The food is a bit pricey. The dessert was amazing. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Poorly managed. Unnecessarily long waits despite multiple open tables. Servers lack customer service. Orders a steak medium rare and the serves it ice-cold-rare. After sending back to kitchen they re-served the piece seemingly in the same condition. The waiter then had manager come address issue 15minutes later after my family was more than 1/2 way done their meal. Committed to getting a different dish to the table in \"3 minutes\"... 12minutes later no one brought a dish or offered check. Bad night maybe... Incredibly bad service for sure. Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"They use special rum that's only available here. More authentic. Can't go wrong with any tropical drinks. You can taste the alcohol from a frozen drink.  Love the drinks here"}
{"text":"The food was average at best.  The service was below average.  We went for a birthday celebration and ordered some appetizers.  The Edamame arrived covered by a bowl but the bowl was dirty.  The Warm Spinach Dip was pretty tasteless.  The steak Frites and Jerk Chicken Pasta were decent but the Fish Tacos were a mess and not very tasty.  The drinks were overpoured and not very well made.  The service bar was extremely slow and it took quite a while to even get our drinks.  Finally, we had made a reservation several days prior to the dinner and the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us.  Not the best experience."}
{"text":"awesome spot for carribean atmosphere dining and drinks, good selection and great food, been coming here for years, always happy, favorite dish= Caribbean jerk chicken with plantains, yellow rice& black beans"}
{"text":"This place was pretty flipping fantabulous!!! Sam was our server and was hands down the best. We started with drinks, Coquitos mind blowing creamy goodness.  Our first time and we will definitely be back. I had the steak oscar which was cooked to perfection. My arm candy had the Jamaican Jerk chicken YUM! Such delicious food for an outstanding price here in Vegas and we have been to quite a few!!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of twelve people for lunch so may have overwhelmed the staff  but service was slow.  Had the Applewood Bacon  burger.  It was OK (pretty hard to mess up a burger)  Family member ordered the cuban sandwich.  He did not like it.  Probably  because it wasn't  really  a cuban.  They don't come with salami,  lettuce, tomato and your supposed  to use cuban pork which this did not taste like.  ( I live near Miami so know Cuban food )  Overall, it was OK, nice atmosphere with so-so food.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Maybe we got the wrong dishes. I got the chipotle beef rice bowl and my girlfriend got the fish tacos. The rice bowl was horrible. It was cheesy rice with beef smothered in barbecue sauce. I didn't eat very much of it. The fish tacos were OK. The sorbet served with the fruit salad tasted very good. We also got onion rings as an appetizer. Those were good as well. This might be a good happy hour place but I don't think I would suggest any one to come here for a normal dining experience. Service was OK."}
{"text":"You must visit this place when visiting Las Vegas. They have the best onion rings and portobello burgers. This place has a reputation of quality over quantity and the price for their meals are not too bad. 
If you want good food off the strip, you must check this place out!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews. This place is really fantastic! We had an excellent waiter - Marcus.  He helped us with all our questions,  suggested we come back for happy hour. .and was extremely attentive. We had the ahi tuna and jamaican chicken wings - both were delicious..the wings are FULL wings too - all 3 sections. I had the salmon and fresh greens tostadas and my husband had the salmon.  Both were so good..nobody was talking during the meal. .we were so absorbed in our meals! And lastly - THE MUSIC...Live music..music by Bob Marley, Jimmy Buffet and an easy, grooving island feel to the entire restaurant - which can easily accommodate large groups.  A new LV favorite for us! We will definitely be back for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Celebrating the wife's birthday we decided to come to Bahamas breeze. Some of our group had been here before so we were expecting a great experience. For the most part our server did her job well, but we received some drinks that were watered down. The food took a while to get to us but it was busy so that is understandable. What killed the night is my buddy pulling a 12 inch blonde hair out of his mouth while chewing his jerk pasta. Everyone's apatite was ruined after that."}
{"text":"ok so after 2 years of searching I finally found Jerk Chicken, I ordered the Jerk chicken wings and Jerk Chicken Pasta and as I was smashing I forked up a long ass blonde hair atleast 12 inches long didn't notice it until it was in my mouth, talking about gross that meeker up the entire meal for 6. We were out celebrating my sisters bday and no one felt comfortable eating their food. I also ordered a long island drink and it was weak. I'll never return 2 this joint again.  Oh an the waitress said this happened to someone else 2 night with the same dish. Dig that."}
{"text":"Visitor in the Pittsburgh area. Dinner was tremendous and our server did an excellent job.
We were fortunate to get outside seating so we were able to enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Terrible service,  we were told there was a 15 minute wait and then after 30 minutes when I checked back we were sat immediately and everyone else that walked in was sat immediately. No explanation was given. It was poorly run with the waitstaff clearly confused and frantic. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Loved my food and my drinks.  Yolanda was my waitress and she was nice.  I loved their margarita sampler.  It was more than I expected it to be.  Chicken empandas, the house salad and the chicken bowl were awesome. I wish there was a location in Southern California."}
{"text":"Allways great service and great food absolutely no complaints very inexpensive well worth it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant. I went on Sunday and it was pretty calm , not too many people inside. I had drinks, an appetizer, entree, and desert. 

Drinks:
Frozen Bahamarita - delicious
Ultimate Pina Colada - just OK. I wish it was in a bigger class

For an appetizer I had the Adobo Chicken Taco. It was good. I liked how it had a little crunchiness to it. It was a little cold though

My entree was the Island Hopper and included onion rings, conch fritters, coconut shrimp, and Jamaican jerk wings.

I ate half an onion ring, nothing special about those since I cannot stand the taste of onions. The conch fritters should really be called conch balls. I love fried conch from this local place in Miami so that was the main reason why I decided to go with this meal, I was disappointed. They were not horrible but could have been seasoned more and they barely had any conch in them. The coconut shrimp was standard though most of the seasoning was on the outside and not the shrimp itself. Being Jamaican I always go for things that are jerked. These wings were not jerked at all. No spice or kick to them. The sauces that came with the food were soooo good!!!

For desert I had the Banana Nut Bread Supreme. It was delicious. The only negative was the stale, warm, soggy banana slice.


I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!  We have always had wonderful meals and the atmosphere is so inviting!  We especially love the coconut shrimp, rice and green beans - yum!"}
{"text":"Thank you Bahama Breeze for helping make our Wedding dinner better than what we excepted!! They went above and beyond to help make our wedding night the most memorable night of our lives. Great food. Great drinks. Great accommodations. Friendly staff. 


Ps. They even moved tables so we could have our first dance and father-daughter dance. So nice of them. Yes, I did cry at my reception."}
{"text":"One of the BEST restaurants in Vegas! This West Indies Curry Chicken is delicious and reasonably priced. Umbrella drinks make you escape from reality. 4 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the Beautiful Decor!!...The inside of this beautiful restaurant looks like you are actually in an establishment, on a Bahama Island...The Bar is gorgeous, as well. And they offer great Happy Hour portions and prices! I loved their Fish Tacos, seasoned rice, and Jerk Wings. 

I was surprised that they didn't offer more crab and lobster dishes, since  a variety of seafood dishes are popular in the Bahamas. I have only been here once, but I will definitely come back! The staff was very friendly, attentive, and professional."}
{"text":"We love this place. We go each time we are in Vegas. They have our favorite ribs. It's a full rack for $20 including fries. Note: the ribs are coated with a guava-based BBQ sauce, so don't expect the typical smoky southern barbecue. They have a full bar with a complete catalog of mixed drinks, although the drinks are pricey. Located on Flamingo road just east of the strip, but not walking distance. Lots of other Caribbean inspired dishes, but we have never tried any other items because the ribs are too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Tim is an awesome server who deserves corporate recognition the general manager is also super helpful she had put together a catering order for me that was absolutely delicious and on point as well as economical.
The ultimate compliment was many guests felt that thought that it was a home cook meal."}
{"text":"My family LOVES this place, so imagine our surprise when we took company & discovered they got rid of the banana cream pie. What the hell were you thinking? NOTHING on your dessert menu compares. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I just  moved here and my sister came to visit me.  I wasn't familiar with the restaurants  yet, but we found this place on the Internet.  We went on a Sonday evening after making 'call ahead seating' reservations.  When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The service was immediate and friendly.  The menu has a good selection and a huge drink menu.  The atmosphere was  very  authentic  and casual.  Easy to find and  their own parking lot right off the street.  My sister had a fabulous tropical drink, suggested by our waiter, that she not only loved but only cost $6.00.  We both had seafood which was fabulous.  When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised how reasonable it was for all we got.  We will definitely be going back again and I will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and each time I was pleased with my experience. The staff was efficient friendly. The food impeccable and the management obviously trusts its employees as they should. All in all a great place to eat. First time we went just my family of five, next time was a party of 11. Either 2, 5, or 15 their staff was on top of their game. Kudos"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in and was greeted by Tiffany I knew this would be one of those \"memorable moments\"! Tiffany was awesome! Very professional and willing to address all my questions considering this was my first time. Once my guest and I were seated at the table our waitress Anita blew me away with her PHENOMENAL customer service! She was so knowledgeable about the drink menu, the appetizers, and the background of the different foods that I literally felt as if I were in the Bahamas and completely forgot I was in Las Vegas. After ordering our drinks and food came out quickly and everything was DELICIOUS! What truly made my experience amazing was Anita! She was fun, personable, and really demonstrated the epitome of what I consider a phenomenal customer service experience! Because of her service this will now be my go-to drinks & appetizers choice when scheduling my weekly hangouts with friends and coworkers. And yes, I will be requesting Anita every time! I was so impressed with Anita's service that I literally chased the manager Sean down just to rave about Anita. To my surprise, considering he was busy, my interrupting him didn't phase him one bit. He was very professional and equally as enthusiastic about Anita as I was! He genuinely thanked my guest and I for visiting and guess what else....genuinely invited us to come back and visit again! I can't say enough great things about this place!!!!! Thanks Tiffany, Anita, and Sean."}
{"text":"We love Bahama Breeze so much we invited over 40 of our family and friends  to join us for our wedding rehearsal dinner! Natalie's staff is amazing. Great food, wonderful staff and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always consistent and always good. Not to mention a very nice host and good service as well."}
{"text":"Almost perfect. The service was super slow. I still tipped 10%. I was at the bar. So no excuse there. The food tasted  excellent and alcohol are awesome. Price is neck breaker on regular days!!! Go at happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had.  We went for lunch on my birthday with my three kids and husband.  We waited 43 minutes (YES-43 minutes) for our drinks!  Our appetizer came and went and we didn't even have waters.  While our waitress was apologetic and I don't blame her, I should not have had to ask for waters when she came and told us three times that the bar was backed up.  We finally asked for the manager - which explains why the restaurant is run so horribly.  We explained the wait for drinks and all he had to say was \"I know, it's crazy\".  I will never, ever go back here.  We had our wedding shower here 10 years ago and it was great back then but so terrible now that we'll never go back.  (I would give it zero stars but that's not an option)."}
{"text":"The hardest thing is deciding where to start, especially considering I never write reviews.  We had never been to Bahama Breeze before and with trying any new place there is always that slight worry. We walked up to a restaurant that looks as if it was flown in from the Caribbean up to the hostess' stand and were warmly greeted. We were shown our way to the table and were given their menu which has an extensive selection, especially the house cocktails. We were delightlfully greeted by our server Sandra and we informed her it was our first time and we would need a moment to take in the vast menu. She was truly polite and gave us some suggestions and brought us our water while we mulled everything over, that's when our excitement started going up as we looked at the specialty drinks. 

I'm not a drinker and the fact that these drinks caught my eye is a good sign. We started off by ordering a truly delicious Bahama Margharita (an infusion of pineapple, strawberry and kiwi with tequila) and my girlfriend a Strawberry Banana Daquiri. Both drinks made to perfection. We started our appatizers in a simple manner with wonderfully crisp coconut shrimp as well as chips and salsa, both which were brought to us very quickly, while we continued to look at the menu. All the while Sandra keeping an eye on us and ensuring our satisfaction. Finally we decided to settle on the Baby Back Ribs for myself an the Filet Mignon for her. 

The meal was astounding. The ribs were falling off the bone and well sauced, and the mashed potatoes I requested with them were delicously creamy and flavorful. My girlfriends filet was cooked to perfection and her sides were enjoyed with gusto. We ordered another round of drinks (keep in mind drinks aren't my thing so they must be good for me to order another) but we decided to try something different. My girlfriend tried The Blue (something, I don't recall the rest of the name sadly) and I enjoyed the Berry Berry Good. Both of us would share drinks to try more of a variety and we fell absolutey in love with the Berry Berry Good, as i quote my girlfriend, \"next time I'm getting five of these.'  I'm confident I will as well.

Next we go on to the dessert. When we are as stuffed as were at the end of a meal we don't even consider it, but we figured this place has been so amazing how can we say no? Dulce de Leche Cheesecake and a Chocolate Island (a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse sitting in a delicate sea of a vanilla bean sauce) I didn't want to take it home, i just wanted to eat everything there and get another order to go, it was that incredible. We were so delighted at the end of the meal and asked to see the manager (Jesse is his name) and couldn't begin to describe how happy we were.

All this alone provides something worth noting, but what will truly brings us back beyond anything else is Sandra. We can confidently say that she is without a doubt the greatest server we have ever had. Truly charismatic and professional. When were were looking at our menus in the beggining we saw that she was busy but never once did she let that bother her nor take away from the quality she was providing not just us but everyone. We had great conversations with her and never once did we feel rushed or neglected, it was the exact opposite. She made our night, so much so that on the drive home we were still talking about how amazing she is (plus the quality of the restaurant) We will absolutely make sure that when we go in next we will request her (and if there's a wait we will not mind at all) I cannot stress enough how she truly is the greatest server we have ever had. She is a gem that must never be lost. 

Everything about this place is remarkable. They took two first time diners and in one fantastic experience made us die hard fans."}
{"text":"Happy hour is good here. The place is a hit or miss. My last experience was not that great. The table across from us went un bussed for the hour we were there. Never seen the front end manager."}
{"text":"So a group of 8 went there on Saturday as a get together of retired coworkers. My first time there.!! I had a Bahama Mama cocktail to start along with beef empanadas. They were tasty with the sides and then I had the Pork tenderloin with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans with the fruity Jamican version of salsa. My meal was delicious. I had the coconut cream pie for dessert. Waitress was great for 8 people. We stayed almost 2hrs then were abruptly being asked to leave."}
{"text":"I just love this place for lunch!  I work in the Wells Fargo Tower, which makes it so convenient.  The service is always great, and the food even better.  It's a must-try!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, and the ambiance was nice, but what I didn't care for was the food itself.  We ordered coconut shrimp as an appetizer, and thought it was very mediocre.  The coconut shrimp at Outback blows these away.  I ordered baby back ribs, and the wife ordered shrimp linguine.  The ribs had a ton of fat, but my wife did like her dish.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but I've had so much better, and I hate spending money on something that doesn't wow me."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this place! It really has that Caribbean feel to it. I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken which was delicious, followed by the chocolate pineapple upside down cake which was good too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, love the tropical ambiance.  Service is usually good. They have huge onion rings and the beef patties (like beef curry in little pastries with mango salsa on the side) are great!  Food always tastes fresh.  Desserts were yummy, too!"}
{"text":"I was here mother's day, my mom's first time here. It was filled to max cappacity and about 45 minute wait. At first the hostess told us we could not sit at the bar to wait for our table. Eventually another staff member told us we could help ourselves to full service bar. Our waitress/bartender was Nicole and she was very efficient for being so crowded, she really did a good job and was very friendly. We ordered tortilla soup, Cilantro lime chicken and chipotle beef bowl, and rum cake and banana bread for dessert, we got our food drinks and dessert all in under a half hour. Very impressive service and tasty dishes! The kitchen and bar were really working over time to please all of the customers.My mom was happy with our visit. Nice job staff and management!"}
{"text":"I ordered an Island Hopper Combo lunch of shrimp, onion rings and chicken.  The shrimp and onion rings were served and the manager indicated they were having problems in the kitchen and the chicken was still cooking.  The chicken arrived halfway into the meal and looked dry, overcooked and freezer burned. Rather than complain to the manager, I ate the chicken. 
Five hours later I was vomiting and had severe diarrhea into the night. Food poisoning I suspect from the chicken. (Note: Apparently, the Island Hopper Combo has now been removed from the menu at Robinson.)
I have a feeling that the chicken I was served had been improperly stored and rather than tell me they did not have wings, they served it and hoped I would not get sick. Well, I ate it and I got sick!"}
{"text":"Came here with a local after needing a change of scene in Vegas.   It was still prop-ish but atleast you did not feel overwhelmed with so many people like in the hotels.  Food was decent, not the greatest just somewhat different and there was live band.  Not really some where I would come to Vegas for."}
{"text":"The food was bland and lukewarm. I got Cajun meal and the only flavor was jalapeño. Even worse, my bf's black bean burger had bacon on it! He's been a vegetarian for five years!! Luckily he noticed and sent it back, which left whole table preoccupied with when the waitress will come back to check on us and bring back the meal. Then the manager came by a very uncomfortable, aggressive and disingenuous apology. They didn't even have the class to take it off the bill! Oh and no complimentary bday desert either. Going there was a huge mistake."}
{"text":"At first the environment was good. They put us in the back of the bus where it was less lively and no one came to serve us till like 10 minutes after we seated. Waitress come up to ask if we were good as she was walking away at the same time.\" Bi***. No we ain't good no ones serving us or even brought us drinks \"   SHe says \" oh im sorry what can I get you\" apparently she don't know what table she serves. Got the food and the drinks were ok. Environment kinda sucked.  Food was good.  Service sucked. As we were walking out we see our waitress in the damn patio on the damn phone while her tables are waiting. Please fire her a$$."}
{"text":"This place is big and decorated beautifully. The ambiance is very settle with a Caribbean feel. Our waiter was friendly and made sure we were content. I ordered a Calypso Shrimp w. Bahamarita and they were delicious! The food portion was big. It was big enough to go home and eat some more! The prices are very reasonable (very cheap compared to NY prices). I recommend this place and will definitely go back whenever I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"It has been a few years since we have eaten here and were looking forward to our favorite sandwiches for lunch. First let me say, that service here is hit or miss. Sometimes it is fabulous. Other times, horrible. There is no in between. This was a horrible time - waitress would not shut up, did not accept that we did not want alcoholic drinks or appetizers and tried to push them on us, she pulled a menu one of my party was holding and started flipping through it, insisted on telling us the \"specials\" despite we knew what we wanted.... anyway - we were looking forward to the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Portabello Mushroom Sandwich. Both were a disappointment - chicken was like rubber, bread tasted bad (not ciabatta anymore). The portabello sandwich was mashed flat as if someone sat on it and the vegetables were diced small and indistinguishable. More so - for a Saturday lunch it was dead... not the normal for this place. Usually it is busy. Looking out the window we got to watch a drunk/high gentleman purusing the parking lot, and then when we left we were confronted by a man who \"wanted to ask us questions\" and when we refused he started swearing, dropping the f-bomb and being obnoxious. It was very unsettling to our group - family members from seniors down to children. The place has not been kept up - although when we entered there was a young girl cleaning the windows, the table was dirty, the ledge where the plants are was full of dust, the menus had food on them. No reason for that. 

The area this restaurant is in has certainly changed tremendously and as well, other restaurants in the area seemed to have changed hands/chains as well. If you are on the Strip, I would advise you to stay there and eat. It is not worth the taxi ride over there and I certainly would not advise you to walk down there from your hotel. 

This used to be a popular place for lunch for the UNLV crowd, and possibly during the week things are different. But don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I officially love this place! Came on a Tues night, sat out on the deck to listen to live music by the featured Reggae artist who was performing. My son and I absolutely loved him! Great vibes. Great song choices. Just leggggggit. The food was great and the service was absolutely awesome. Travis was our server, was completely on point the entire night! 
We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing 1st time experience! Amazing food and customer service. Maurice was my server and he has excellent customer service!! Most definitely will be back! Thank you Bahama Breeze"}
{"text":"Good food, though a little overpriced.  I usually get the Carribean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which has a fabulous cream sauce, chicken and asparagus.  So good.  I also love the West Indies beef patties and the Ultimate Pina Colada.  I've heard other dishes are just so so.  The service  is usually outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Not sure of his name but her had spikey hair. I wasn't sure about what I wanted and he took the time to explain the menu to my daughter and I . I had the fish tacos ...yummmy and my daughter tried the burger. We left full, happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"I took my out of town guests here on a Monday evening for dinner. The service was absolutely terrible! There were only a few people in the place and it took them over 15 minutes to sit us. Then it took them more than 20 minutes to get someone to get outer drink orders. No one even spoke to us during that entire time. People were walking past us, but no one even noticed that five people were sitting at a table in the middle of the room. When some one finally did speak to us, she did not know much about the menu items. It took us three hours (that's right, you read that right) to get out of that place! Never again. They may have been short staffed, but I can't believe they would be that rude and ignore their customers. No excuse for this."}
{"text":"Food was great drinks were great...if you like jerk chicken try the jerk chicken entree...amazing!"}
{"text":"I have family that lives near there and we seem to eat at Bahama Breeze every time I am in Vegas.  Pretty good 'island' food and a fun environment for the money, and you will definitely not leave hungry, I have had leftovers each time I ate there.

You HAVE TO get their Cuban Bread for an appetizer, it is pretty simple but my mouth waters just thinking about it.  I have had the paella, coconut shrimp, a chicken pasta dish, and a lobster/shrimp pasta dish and I would order any of them again.  There was something about the chicken pasta dish that I REALLY enjoyed, a tangy garlic cream combo flavor and really tender chicken and mushrooms.

Their red beer is satisfying and for only a couple bucks for a 20oz mug you can definitely throw back a few with no damage to the wallet.  They also have a lot of frozen mixed drinks that looked good but I cant comment on them as I mainly stick to beer when I have a drink. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the easy going style and comfort of the decor.   A big menu full of choices but no scallops which I was in the mood for.   My wife and I each choose a different fresh fish which came with rice or mashed potatoes and green beans.  We specifically asked to have our veggies cooked and not served crunchy like so many restaurants serve.   The meal did not come with soup nor salad not even bread.  We asked about bread but was told we could order a loaf for extra charge.  I did added a side lobster tail for an extra $9.99.   When our meal came the green beans were not cooked hardly at all.  They did offer to bring more.  Our mash potatoes were warm but not hot.  The fish was good but not great and they forgot my side lobster tail.  The manager came over and apologized which was nice but did not offer anything other than his apology.  I would have declined a free dessert but that would have been appropriate.
I have eaten here before and it was better but will probably not go back for a while."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bahama Breeze and it was great experience.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Tropical Fruit on Mixed Greens and it was excellent -  a perfect balance of fresh fruit, greens, and spiced chicken topped with goat cheese! The service was also great. Our waiter was very attentive and it was obvious that he enjoyed his job. I look forward to going back and trying something else from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"As a local, one of my favorite places to go. 2 happy hours and mojitos are amazing. The only reason I didn't give 5 star is the lack of big tv's, sorry but I am a big sports fan. Also I had been a long time costumer, I usually arrive alone to meet my husband later after work and the hostess stuff are far from friendly, is like if you arrive as a woman sitting at the bar does not deserve to be greated!!!. The rest of the stuff are very friendly, from servers to bartenders to supervisors on duty.:)."}
{"text":"My family and i were on vacation and drove by this place. We decided to stop. Best choice ever!! I ordered the beef empanadas happy hour special they were awesome and the stuffed banana was amazing it was our 1st time trying new food my bf got the cuban sandwich very good. Got very busy at 4pm because of the happy hour but we will totally come again just for this place."}
{"text":"Strawberry Mojito: If they hadn't packed a half of a pint glass with crushed ice (instead of the cubed ice they put into their glasses of soda or water) it might've been fine. It watered the whole thing down. My opening cocktail was a minty lime water.

Appetizer of West Indies beef patty was delicious. You could probably buy them in bulk at Costco. The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)

Chicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.

Our server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.

It's a chain restaurant, meaning not truly ethnic. Can someone recommend a sweet hole-in-the-wall?"}
{"text":"We have always loved Bahama Breeze, and considered it a special night out!  NO LONGER!   We were a party of 6 seated outdoors and there were 2 large parties inside, but to WaIT 3 HOURS for food after ordering is unheard of!   What was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner was ruined!   2 tables of 4 ( we were 6) nearby came in after us, were served and left before our order arrived.   The Mahi bowl I ordered- 3 hours later was a soupy tasteless bowl of coconut milk!   The half off discount hardly made up for what was a sad excuse of service all around.   This location will not be visited by the 3 families in our party.  Very sad to say- but it all falls on poor management."}
{"text":"I loveeee Bahama Breeze !! The environment is so awesome and this place is so much fun. The food is also really great. It feels like your on vacation on an island when your in there. Love this place so much, if your looking for a great time this is a great place to go !!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant three times, the first time was for Valentine's Day. The service was slow and our food took a while ( 1 hour ) we figured it was due to the holiday. Didn't think much of it 
The second time, we were in the area and decided to give it another shot. So, after waiting over an hour to get our food AND water. I remembered I ordered an alcoholic drink, which was completely melted because the server forgot... 
We decided to not come back up. 
However, after receiving a large gift card for here. We decided to come, Once again. 
The service started off okay, nice server, helpful and kind. However it took us 15 minutes to get water. And once again, the food took over an hour and 15 minutes .. 
This will be our last visit too this restaurant! DO NOT GO"}
{"text":"Scott was the best server/waiter  ever, he was very nice and consist And he also helped  me pick my drink, food, dessert . Best customer service ever!!! I absolutely love this place. Awesome food and drinks.   I wish there was one in Los Angeles, but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Michael M. Is an hourly manager here and has worked for Darden for years.  He is an awesome addition to the Bahama Breeze and will hopefully help it to improve.  Jeno was a good bartender and both of them made sure everything from drinks to appetizers to dinner was superb.  Food quality could be a little better but the appetizers -especially when they are half off during happy hour are worth a try."}
{"text":"3 stars because it was comical that our server had the personality of an awkward boy going through puberty. I got the Jamaican jerk sandwhich which was fantastic. We also got the flight of rum and margaritas which was pretty cool  but when I asked the youngest brother from home improvement on what drinks were good he looked like I was asking him if I could kiss him mom confused and a little grossed out. Regardless it was ok I would try it again. Jerk food was good jerk kid serving was not."}
{"text":"Everything I got was packed with flavor and my taste buds are a happy camper!   My brother lived in Vegas and this was one of his favorite places and I'm so glad he took us there.  The Beef Empanadas make you say MMMMMmmmm after every bite and for the main course I got the chef's pic of Stuffed Crab, Rice and a savory sauce.  I was so happy that I literally had to go one more time before I left!"}
{"text":"First of all I have loved this place over the years! This restaurant has been one of my favorites. We went there tonight for my sister's 61st birthday!. The food was pretty good as always but the service was probably a 2 out of 10. Your server can make or break your experience and our server broke it. From our initial greeting to leaving it seemed she was going through the motions. I noticed other tables had a candle lit. Ours was unlit. I waited 15 minutes and finally lit it my self. Our server just did not want to give us the experience we deserved. Maybe our server was having a bad day or just tired as it was 8:30-9:30 pm. She just didn't smile or seemed enthused
about serving us. I was also unhappy that they did not sing to my sister and charged 8 bucks for her birthday desert. I have never been charged before at any establishment. My Mojito was all ice. I think the bartender needs a lesson from Havana Grill in Henderson on a proper Mojito. Seafood Paella, wood fire chicken and burger were good but not great. I hope our next experience will be back to the standards we expect from Darden and especially Bahama Breeze.

UPDATE:
The manager called me today 03/10/13 and offered to make it right.He also stated his first priority was to ensure that i will have a good experience...I want to thank the manager for the phone call and glad to see Bahama Breeze cares about the satisfaction of their costumers......."}
{"text":"Great food & fruity drinks. Enjoy your jerk chicken pasta while listening to a live reggae band.  Nice decor.  Reminds me of islands back home."}
{"text":"A few of my friends from work and I came here for lunch last week. I really like this place and the atmosphere. It's very tropical and relaxing. I ordered a Bahama Mama and the bar there does a fantastic job with that drink! It was delicious. My food was good and the service was very good. Our server was a very nice lady and she got us everything we wanted with a smile. Very personable. I have been here a few times and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze has good food but horrible management. We made a reservation two days in advance for a 9-person party on my sister's birthday. We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, cake in hand. They had not reserved any tables for us because they just didn't have room, and then said we would have to wait for others to finish. This completely defeats the purpose of a RESERVATION. But the worst was yet to come. The general manager lied to us repeatedly... first she told us that a party table in the back had paid and were finishing their desserts. We watched as their first round of desserts were delivered 15 minutes later. Apparently at some point she told the party table that another party was waiting and they would need to leave soon. I would have been insulted if they had said this to me while I was enjoying my dinner, just to cover up for their incompetence. She even stationed servers near their table to put pressure on them to leave (she admitted this to us... wow). Later, another 9-person party table opened up, but we watched for 20 minutes as it remained dirty. We asked the manager if we could just sit there (we had been waiting for our RESERVED table for over an hour at this point), and she told us that she heard from somebody we didn't want to sit there. Another lie. The table remained unclean. She wouldn't even look us in the eye unless we went up to her first and her tone was overly rude all night. Finally an hour and a half later we were seated and given one free appetizer. Hooray. The waitress was great. If you make reservations here, don't expect them follow through."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie - surprised to find how much I enjoyed the jalapeño mojito. The coconut shrimp were on point, and the bartender and service was above my expectation. Not a bad use of your money."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. I had a drink called something like \"Bahamacardi\" and it was so good! The shrimp linguine was delicious, and my sister said her fish was too. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  Food was very good.  My wife ordered the Frozen Bahamarita and is was good.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Not the best food experience. Ordered churasco medium rare the outside pics were cooked food and the inside pieces looked like they were hidden in the middle cooked well done?? Not the best flavor on this dish. My sister ordered a mojito... if you are going to call something a cuban mojito at least attempt to make it correct (it tasted like cough syrup). Service was good. I have been to the one in Tampa the food and drinks are night and day."}
{"text":"Great place in the dead or winter for a little Caribbean style fun. It's a little franchise feeling but service and food is great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants and go-to's for something other than Outback or in the neighborhood. I really like the Salmon, though the Jamaican jerk wings off the happy hour menu are always delicious!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.   My wife and I ordered and an entree salad and a Burger. The salad came without dressing and there was no catsup for the burger.   I asked the kitchen person who brought the burger for catsup and she said ok. She never returned.  We waited for 15 minutes for someone to come by to ask for these things.  I finally went to the reception station and asked for the manager at the same time my wife went to the waitress station and asked another waitress for some help.  Our waitress suddenly showed up and put in an order for a new burger (which was stone cold by this point). My wife got her dressing finally and it was the wrong dressing!   The manager never came!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant!!! You can choose so many wonderful foods:
Salmon prepared a selection of ways( other fish too)
Coconut shrimp, wonderful:
The best ribs in town: 
Sweet mashed potatos... Yummy
Onion Rings to die for. All delicious veggies! 
Could go on and on !!! Try it... It's irresistible ! Drinks are great too! Go there!"}
{"text":"Loved the Bahama Breeze in Tampa so I tried this one when I moved to vegas. Service was horrible. I never bring it up but it was so bad I told the manager since I had the same waitress twice. He said that is just how she is. It took forever to get anything."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos and they were great. Waiter suggested try them blackened and I'm glad I did. I will be going back when in town. Service was a little slow but still very good and friendly."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience!  The drinks were strong, the food amazing, the service top notch!  We wish we had one close to us!  AMAZING!!!

Standouts were the onion rings and coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"We love the carribean atmosphere and excellent food. The drinks are excellent and plenty strong. One of our favorite stops when we are in the area"}
{"text":"We went here our first night in town an its all we could talk about!
We were seated immediately. It was a little loud, but it was also busy. I do wish it ad been a little brighter, but it was still a welcoming atmosphere. The waitstaff were also pleasant and attentive without being annoying.

The food was so good! I had the calypso fettuccine.  It was perfect. The lighter portion was just big enough to make me full, but not so big that I was stuffed. We also had a slice of cheesecake that was also delicious, my fiancé's favorite part of the meal. We really enoyed our visit and plan on stopping in again the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Whenever I come here I come for just the lemonade. I do order food with it, typically the baby back ribs. My last visit the ribs were ehhhh. As I said, I come for the lemonade. Now the lemonade! Sucked... It used to be fresh squeezed and delicious. The bartender told me that now they make the syrup mix in the back beforehand. I came a week prior and it was still delicious. I dunno, I'm leaning towards him just being lazy. I even ordered two different ones. Both sucked and we're just syrupy tasting. Nasty nasty nasty. 

The visit I'm commenting on was about a month ago. I haven't been there since and probably won't return just because of the lemonade. 

To the bartenders credit, he didn't charge me for both lemonades."}
{"text":"Bad and overpriced.   Wanted to like this place, convenient location, nice patio outside on a Spring evening, but no. We ordered steak entrees, Oscar and Sirloin, neither was cooked correctly Carly.  Medium fully well done, medium rare was cold and bloody.  Asking for assistance from the waiter got no better results.  We were hungry so we ended up trying to eat what we had but they were so grizzly and tough we gave up.  The fish tacos literally needed to be held up and drained, pouring off some liquid ( wet lettuce?) ruining the crunch a taco should have.  Mashed potatoes were only potatoes side choice, white or sweet.  They had skins on, white mashed potatoes and were not washed!  Periodically, you could feel the crunch of sand/ dirt from potatoes not well scrubbed before cooking.  Yuk!  Ordered wings and quesadilla appetizers early, knowing the other two in my party would arrive hungry.  Waiter discussed hot or mild wings.  He brought onion rings instead and quickly dropped them off and left.  We ate the quesadilla, caught him later to correct and he said I said \"rings\". I said No and reminded him, \" spicy or mild?\" And he said Oh yeah. The weird thing is that he reached to take the rings away.  Usually, they say sorry Ill bring you the correct item, and offer you the other, since it cannot go to anyone else.  We may have eaten a few if he had, given how hungry everyone was, if he had. But no, and it was so late by then we cancelled the wings.  This whole fiasco was $75! $90 with tip.  Will never return, neither should you."}
{"text":"went beyond my expectations!!! food,ambiance and service was awesome. I highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the grilled chicken with cilantro cremation. we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Thursday night (service industry night) had good music and a 9pm-closing happy hour. Service was also very good, definitely a place I will visit again in Vegas"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had a pretty good experience. Our server Randy was great. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken (a bit too salty though) and when I cut into it, it was still pink on the inside so he took it back and brought me a new plate, one that the chicken was fully cooked. While I was waiting for the new plate, he brought me a salad to snack on, on the house. Then when we finished eating and asked for the check, I realized he didn't charge me for my plate. Free dinner. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for an early dinner/happy hour and it was delicious! The customer service was friendly and prompt! We ordered a few drinks and appetizers from the happy hour and it was fantastic. For dinner, we shared the large size jerk chicken pasta and it was plenty for two people. The piña coladas were made perfectly topped off with a fresh pineapple piece. The atmosphere is fun and laid back as if we were at a tropical resort on the island. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cortni was awesome. Perfect customer service. Food was excellent. Will definitely be back and hope to have her again as our server."}
{"text":"Live Music on the Enclosed Patio, while eating Carribean food near a fire pit on a cool December night...... Loved it!  Great waiters and management shows passion and professionalism at this location.  At the time of visit, our Restaurant dot Com certificates were honored and made the experience even more enjoyable.  Black Bean Burger (vegetarian style) and Rice Bowls were on point. Virgin Pina Colada was a bit on the sweet side, but no complaints!  The pineapple salsa....  a MUST have with Sambosa. 

Great location, away from the strip, but close enough to main streets."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar and had the shrimp and lobster quesadillas. They were excellent but the service at the bar was a little slow. If you like amber beers try their brand I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I kind of want to find something to nitpick about this place.  I hate being a guy that hands five stars out like they're candy.  But this place is truly amazing.  If I have to pick a restaurant outside of our usual rotation, or a place to go with friends, it'll be Bahama Breeze.  An amazing alcoholic drink menu (Painkiller, a bunch of mojitos) as well as some of the best lemonade you'll ever have (Lemon Breeze).

We typically have great service.  This last time featured a waiter that was very into his job and described menu items with words like \"exquisite.\"  It's refreshing to have a waiter who is knowledgeable and happy to help.  The decor is clean and aesthetically pleasing.

We decided to start with the Tostones appetizer, though we weren't quite sure what to expect.  The plantains were crispy and the flavors diverse and delicious.  Despite not being much of a seafood eater, I always go with the fresh fish at the front of the menu.  Normally, it's the mango glazed tilapia.  This time I went with the Mahi Mahi as per the waiter's recommendation.  It wasn't as good as the tilapia, but it was still yummy.  My wife's curry bowl was equally as appetizing.  We left this place as we always do: with a full belly and smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"My husband and I honeymooned in the Bahamas over the holidays and we fell in love with conch fritters. I came home and told everyone how much I loved them and then my aunt sent me a gift card to Bahama Breeze as a wedding present. This place is so good. Like, unexpectedly really really good. And obviously a lot of people know this because the 2 times we've been there for dinner it was super crowded and there was a 45-minute wait. As we were waiting, a manager called out for a party of 2 with a reservation. I never would have thought to make a reservation here but now I know for next time!  Bahama Breeze is very good.  And I got a pina colada that was outstanding!  Whoever the chef is definitely know Carribean food very well."}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here! Sat at the bar before heading out on a flight back west. Anthony was tending bar and made my mojito to perfection, after I asked for some minor specifics. He also recommended a great appetizer that hit the spot. 

Would give 5 stars, but I usually hesitate if I have only had one visit. I will be back (might be awhile as I live In California) and will update on my second trip! 

Try the jerk shrimp....yum."}
{"text":"I used to love Bahama Breeze, but my past couple of visits have forced me to leave a lower rating.

They have changed some of the recipes, and removed the Carribean element to many of their dishes. The flatbreads have become bland pizzas, for example, and several of the seafood dishes have had their fruity sauces replaced with garlic butter generic sauce. The fire pit was also closed down, according to our waiter, and so they do not fire sear their foods anymore. I guess it just broiled.

With those changes, there's nothing special to it anymore and I have not been a customer since. If they reverse those changes i may consider going back and giving a better rating."}
{"text":"I made a big deal to my wife that we had to go to Bahama Breeze this time while we were in Las Vegas.  We went Monday night and a lot of reviewers commented that the concept for the restaurant and it is terrific...it really is nice.  But for us, that was where it ended.  Our service was very good (Thanks Sparky!)  My wife had the curry chicken for dinner...it was so dry and lacked flavor she could not eat it.  She ordered a strawberry magarita and she got a mango margarita instead.  We sent it back and this time it came back with only a little mango in it.  WTF?  The bartender could not make a most simple drink?!?!  To top off our drink issues...The pour on the tequila had to have been a 1/2 ounce if that...it was like drinking mix only and then it was served in a martini glass!.  If you don't have margarita glasses put it in a hurricane glass, those they had..  I had the paella and a couple of beers...it was a safe bet .  My daughter had the jerk chicken pasta, again, just okay, kind of lackluster in flavor.  To drink, she ordered a Bailey's and coffee...served in a regular ol' coffee mug.  A place like this I would have expected a clear mug to showcase the drink...nope, didn't happen.  I know some of this may seem like petty things but...our bill was close to $100 for the 3 dinners, drinks oh...and an appetizer.  The entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either.  Over priced and the Monday night bartender(s) needs a bit work.  We did voice our comments to the manager (actually we were going to leave and our server sent the manager to us!).  He said he will talk to his staff and try to fix things.  He did give us 3 comp drink tickets to use anytime.  One thing we do not do is complain to the manager in order to get a comp meal, we usually will talk to the manager AFTER we pay.  Getting comp'd is not the point, bringing issues to management's attention so they can resolve the problem is the larger issue."}
{"text":"My school group and I found this place after asking the desk clerk at our hotel. Man was it good. The atmosphere is great, it's Carribean themed. For dinner I ordered the blackened chicken pasta which was very tasty and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. Yes, it's a chain but it is one of the better ones out there. Check it out if you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The place was packed. The drinks were fantastic, so was the food and not to forget great service!"}
{"text":"I luv the drink selection, always taste yummy on any day of the week!"}
{"text":"We stopped there late (9:30pm) after our kids hockey tournament game, staff was very nice and sat is immediately. We started off with the lobster quesadilla and bang bang shrimp, both were fantastic...

Main entrees that we ordered were the jerk chicken alfredo pasta, paella, steak oscar, and key west fish tacos. All were really good, EXCEPT the key west fish tacos, they were quite bland and lacking any real flavor, could've used a nice cilantro lime cabbage slaw, or a lemon lime, cilantro mayo....

I would def recommend this place, and would eat there again.."}
{"text":"Great place! Had a Birthday reservation there and they were completely helpful, the staff. The food was really good. Jamaican food with Caribbean vibes. They were busy, but that didn't delay the food orders. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My man and I went here for 'A night to remember'.  It was beautiful as always, wth live plants, live bands and a clean place to eat.  However, since the last time we visited the prices have gone up.
We were extremely happy to see our old barender, who make magnificent, frest Mojitos and also our waiter, who was very attentative and went above and beyond the \"Call of Duty\"
One thing that we do suggust is getting some discounts in the reastruant, it would keep a more steady crowd.  I strongly suggust the Crab Claws St. Thomas as an appetizer, and the Shrimp Liguine as a main course.  We were too full to do dessert, but I image it would be wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"The service was good except for the fact I had to request straws for my drinks. The food was delicious, but there was a small mishap with a possible seafood encounter and a mild allergic reaction. If you're allergic to seafood, make sure to request that your food is cooked/prepared separately from seafood. Despite the minor inconveniences, I enjoyed my first experience here. Also, it didn't take long for our food to be served which is a plus."}
{"text":"I don't want to admit this...but I am actually addicted to this place. In particular it's the coconut shrimp and the chicken empanadas. I guess I am ashamed because I know this is a chain and there is a great Jamaican restaurant in town which serves much more authentic food,but I am also a New englander who loves red lobster, so what can I say.Maybe it's cuz it's own by Darden. I'll figure it out later.

When I come here it reminds me of my trip to Barbados. I love the atmosphere, music,it's so much fun. I forget for a little while I am in a desert. The food is always on point."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday evening. The staff and atmosphere was great.  But the jerk chicken was merely seasoned baked chicken and my coconut shrimp was fried in old oil."}
{"text":"We missed the lunch crowd, so it was somewhat quiet. However, after having a couple of Pina Coladas, my girl friend and I were glad we didn't have to worry about folks thinking we were laughing too loudly! I think I had some kind of jerked shrimp dish, which was excellent. The bartender was extremely pleasant and a native Chicagoan to boot! I will definitely visit there when I'm next in Vegas!"}
{"text":"great happy hours!! Firecracker shrimps, spinach dip, sesame crusted ahi...soooo delicious! Drinks are amazing deal and prices are so cheap. But more than anything, the staffs working there are the most friendly people working at happy hour. Just super nice, fast services. My boyfriend and I love the place. We definitely recommend this restaurant!! If u r tourists and staying on the Strip. It's rally worth to come here rather than going to overpriced bars on the Strip with snobby servers."}
{"text":"Ate there on Sunday with Cousin and his wife.

Love the decor, wait staff great & the food is good.  

I had the lobster quesadilla.  It was good just not great.  I had part of my cousins cuban sandwich and it was good.  I tasted the fish from the fish tacos & they were good.  

OVerall the experience for me was just a ok.  There is a lot to choose from the menu and I am sure there are some great items, but I just didn't get great food."}
{"text":"1st time here few weeks ago and I LOVE THIS PLACE! the place was spacious, food was great, staff was wonderful and not to mention 1/2 off everything on the appetizer menu!!!! and if you feel like your breath is kickin' there's complimentary mouthwash in the bathroom ;)"}
{"text":"1st time here. My boyfriend and I went out for date night and choose this place. Nice atmosphere, very clean. Everything we ate we liked. When the music started it was very loud where we couldn't hear each other. Told manager and they did turn it down a little. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Ten minutes into my farewell to sobriety(I had been on the wagon since 2004, but
exigent circumstances had bent my arm), I was approached by a fellow pilgrim
who asked me if he could help me hold up the bar. \"Indeed, sir, I can use all 
the help I can get.\" It was a sound decision and my new friend acquitted himself well.
Our conversation was the faire you might hear in the watering holes frequented by
other raconteurs like Oscar or Tark or Stephen Colbert(bring it on Colbert, I know 
a lot of big words too.)
But don't let my account give you the impression that the Breeze is a toilet populated
by drunks boring the rest of the drunks with stories they've told too many times. The
Breeze is an island with all of the amenities you would find in a tropical locale. Stout,
jerk chicken, dirty rice, cuba libre, huachinango veracruzana, and conch fritters are
all spoken here. When's the last time you had a bowl of Paella Valenciana? Never?
Well we got it here, mon. They've also got the Cajun equivalent, jambalaya. 
The Breeze is online and you can check  the menu out anytime you want to. They have take out too.
My new found friend and I had a great time and you will too. Check it out."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday party for a co-worker of a friend of mine.  It was not my first choice to go to..honestly I'd only seen this place in passing on my way to the airport.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, nice big building on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo on the Northwest side.  Walking in, however, you feel transported to another place with the Caribbean theme of the restaurant and bar.

However, like a friend has told me, you can't necessarily paint something to make it what it ain't.

The food here is expensive for what you get.  We ordered quite a bit of food for the party: Spinach Dip and Island Chips, Island Onion Rings, West Indies Patties, and Creole Baked Goat Cheese to start.  None of these, to me, were particularly good.  The Spinach Dip was not even touched as my friend ordered it and then tried to pass it along to everyone else because she hated it.  The entree's were a little better: Cuban Sandwich and Margarita Chicken.  However for the $10 and $15 plates of food, I've had much better.

The service was slow for a slow Wednesday early evening dinner.  It was nice that we were able to sit in the atrium outside that was nicely cooled.  All in all, this seems like a poorly done chain restaurant based on a Caribbean theme.  My search shall continue (though how hard I look is yet to be determined)."}
{"text":"Great food. Solid Happy Hour. Tall drafts for $4 and half off appetizers! Everything is flavorful and well executed. There's a wide variety of dishes whether you're a fish monger, meat eater or veggie cruncher.

The ambiance and vibe just add to everything."}
{"text":"This weekend was my first time going to Bahama Breeze with two of my friends and I'm sad I haven't tried this place sooner! Everything was great, I tried the \"Zombie\" drink which was nice and tropical. They have a nice selection of appetizers and my grilled chicken salad that was made with fresh fruit was fabulous! The server was very nice and attentive. I was also a fan of the fact the menu had the calorie information beside each item, it helped me make smarter choices in selecting my meal, I think all restaurants should start doing that. Lastly, I would like to say I enjoyed the island vibe that the entire restaurant had."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a 9pm dinner.  It was a slower weeknight and we sat out on the closed patio area.  There was a guitarist playing some light guitar to some background islander music.

The service was excellent.  All our drinks were quick. The waiter made some good recommendations which we accepted, and we we're glad we did.  He was also personable.  He stayed and chatted for a bit, and we didn't feel rushed at all. 

They recently changed up their menu to include rice bowls.  And boy, the Carnitas bowl is pretty amazing.  I will be ordering that often;  It's a new regular dish for me. 

The reason this place hasn't earned 5 starts, is because their key lime pie leaves a lot to be desired (both my wife and I agree on this).  This should be a staple of a dessert for an islander themed restaurant, and it is a main dish the staff suggest for a dish."}
{"text":"At first they were friendly but the guy who took my order forgot my food. Drinks were good. Won't be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Our evening didn't start here, my husband and I were out to take my daughter to dinner for her 18th birthday, she decided on Hamada of Japan (DO NOT GO HERE, the service is HORRIBLE). Needless to say we ended up at Bahama Breeze we were seated in the area where there have some steel drums set up and a gentleman playing on them.

We were greeted by our server Ivan who was awesome...GREAT Lobster and Shrimp Linguine and Cuban Sandwiches...OOOH and the house Pina Colada!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time dining at bahama breeze was fabulous.... everything was great.... service... food... and the ambiance... so told myself i'd be back again...

2nd attempt... Horrible... brought friends n younger cousins to try the place out... we'll that's the last time i'll refer anyone and will i ever go to that place...i didnt mind what my friend found in the food and the manager giving my friend the option to have a new plate of the same item or order another item but the fact that they ddnt stick to their words... the manager told us that we each can order dessert n give it to us... so i double checked with server if we all can each get desssert as a complimentary.. he went n asked and he said yes... so three ordered dessert... there were 5 of us..when we received the bill... there was no discount... just one of the dessert was taken off... the server told us that he made a mistake understandin the mnager.. when it was too late.... the manager never came back ever again when we finished.. but when i looked back as we paid at the cashier the manager went back and the server probably askin what happened... 

i am the type who doesnt complain...pay it off and leave dont ever come back dont refer anyone..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great place for visitors from out of town or for special occasions. Food and greats are exxxcelent"}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times for dinner and also just drinks and apps and it is always good. We stopped in last eve for a cocktail and app at the bar and had a Moscow mule which was good and an order of Conch Fritters and Yuca Fritas (fried Yuca) which is like a fried potato but better. Everything was very good and reasonably priced. Service from the two female bartenders was excellent as well.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Again i experienced a well prepared meal here at bahama breeze!.... It all began with my servers aley & jason they both displayed professional & vivacious attitudes!.... The service & food are always prepared to perfection. I strongly recommend anyone to come in and experience a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"The worst...
Just because you have the recipe does not mean you can make it right. The paella was a joke it was more like mushy rice soup, could not tell diff. between any of the seafood, not to mention what they called sausage is more like pepperoni slices."}
{"text":"Best key lime pie EVER!  The coconut shrimp are legendary.  Great service and wonderful cocktails.  I had a small mahi and shrimp rice bowl.  Delicious and left enough room for the pie. Very extensive menu with something for everyone."}
{"text":"A very welcoming restaurant with a great menu that really makes an attempt to capture a Caribbean theme. The alcoholic menu was superb. We had Bahama mamas and a strawberry daiquiri and they were very enjoyable. Even though the restaurant seemed full of patrons, our meals were served to us in a very timely manner and we couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! With the birth of our son, my husband and I started a tradition that we would bring any new members of our family here on the day they join our home. We brought both our biological children and also our foster children here. It's a \"Welcome to the Family\" celebration!
We start off with the hummus appetizer which our 5 year old son is a big fan of. (Update: no longer on the menu) We also love their house salads with the cucumber sliver slices, pumpkin seeds, and crisp, tasty dressing! I ALWAYS get the paella which is AMAZEBALLS! Though I make it myself at home, theirs is way better! My husband always gets the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. We are creatures of habit and when you find something as delicious as these two menu items, you gotta stick with it! 
We used to LOVE their coffee as it was Jamaican Blue Mountain; but they switched a while ago, and it's just not the same. Kinda my one let down now.
Their frozen and tropical drinks are delicious, and we can never agree on just one dessert so we always order 2 or more. This time we got Chocolate Island (our go-to favorite) and a never-before tried Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake. Both lived up to expectations!

If you go on a weekend in the summer, they may have a band playing outside. Fingers crossed! 
For a chain restaurant, this is one of the better ones! Darden owns your classic Olive Gardens and Red Lobsters which are good for chains, but they hit it out of the park with this concept! We are partial to Jamaican themed anything though as we honeymooned in Montego Bay."}
{"text":"Haven't a negative thing to say, perhaps the pleasant greeting from all 3 beautiful Ladies as we entered, and Randy our server handled it well."}
{"text":"Bajama Breeze is a cute little themed restaurant that I went to for a friend's birthday. They accommodated us last minute for a party of fifteen so that was nice. We started off with the firecracker shrimp, coconut shrimp, and the fire-roasted jerk shrimp which were all pretty tasty. (Although I did prefer the coconut shrimp over the other two.) For dinner, I ate the lobster and shrimp pasta, without mushrooms, which had very little sauce, but was better than the one at Red Lobster. Our waiter was hilarious and also gave the birthday girl a long sugar cane, yes, sugar cane which was talked about for a good minute. My drink also came with a sugar cane inside of it, the Lemon Breeze, which I added strawberries too. Overall, the place was chill and the food was good, but not great. I think I would go back to see if it deserves that last star.."}
{"text":"This place fell off big time since '05.  I keep giving it a chance because they have some dishes I really can't get anywhere else, but I'm too through with thier poor service.  The last several times I dined my servers had attitudes, bartenders have made me pitiful drinks and act as if  they don't see you while they engage in personal conversation.  I always ordered thier breeze salad but the lettuce is consistently ugly so I have to peruse it first. The last straw were my parents choosing this place for a nice date night, only to have the waitress spill the drink in his lap... something from a sitcom.  No compensation, zero f**ks given ha! Step your game up you all."}
{"text":"\"The menu here is very different from BB's around the country. Less of a Caribbean food selection on the menu. However, their new wood fired chicken sandwich on naan was delicious!\""}
{"text":"I can't in good conscience give this place any stars at this point. We have been going to Bahama Breeze for about two years now. Until lately we have always received good, prompt service. We like to sit at the bar and the bartenders have always taken good care of us. There have been many changes in bartenders the last few months and none for the better. The last two times we have been there the service has been extremely slow. Last night we sat at the bar for twenty five minutes and finally walked out and went to Red Lobster next door. The bar was not that crowded and there were two girls behind the bar. They never even acknowledged we were there. I really doubt we will be back after that experience. The food is great at Bahama Breeze but until they get some decent help, they are going to be in trouble."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one favorite in Las Vegas this would be it! It has the best vibe, best service and best food. If you come here ask for Tina as your server. She is the best. Happy hour is where it's at too. I can't say enough good things about this place. I've been here several times and every time it's been perfect. It almost feels like you're not in Vegas but the Bahamas, hence Bahama Breeze. :) Enjoy your dining experience, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This has always been one of My favorite Vegas restaurants. We always have a large group of people when we visit and the service doesn't disappoint. For my most recent visit, I ordered the stuffed crab shells (definitely my new favorite) and an order of beef empanadas which I ordered to take home. So, I got full off of mango lemonade, lol. Did I mention it's served in a glass and the extra is served in the mixer? When I got around to the beef empanadas with the mango chutney (breakfast), I was pleased with the amazing flavors, even as leftovers.
This restaurant is a great place for happy hour. They have amazing drink & food specials."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because of all the hype that their paella was getting. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. You could say that I was disappointed with the paella. The flavor was a little bland and the rice was a little bit uncooked. The shrimp did not seem fresh to me. I was really disappointed because I love paella. The atmosphere is nice and the service was above average. They have a good lunch menu and some of the specials looked really appetizing. My experience would have been better if I did not have such a high expectation with the paella."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food in Las Vegas. The entire menus is spot on. They also have awesome drinks. The staff is friendly and offer spot on service. Very efficient at keeping the food and drinks flowing. Good location close to the strip for all visitors."}
{"text":"First time ever to Bahama Breeze.  I had the snapper shrimp saute and my husband had the sirloin with cheese and poblano peppers.  We all loved our food.  We also had the dynamite shrimp and empanadas for appetizers, again very good.  We went on a Saturday night and we had to wait over an hour.  So be prepared to wait if you go on the weekend.  The server was attentive and friendly.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Brought mom here for Mother's Day. Planned a day trip at her request. The one place she wanted to go for a nice meal before heading back home was Bahama Breeze. So we visited a few other places in Las Vegas, then ended at Bahama Breeze where mom wanted Paella. She says other than in Spain, Bahama Breeze makes the best Paella! So we ordered salad, which, by the way, was delicious with an array of cold, crisp vegetables with a dynamite vinaigrette, and two orders of Paella enough to serve four people. We even took some home since we couldn't finish it all. A family member and I ordered a glass of the Merlot which was a nice compliment to our meal. There was no room for dessert! Next time for sure. Definitely worth the trip. Will do this day trip thing again this summer. It was fun! Bahama Breeze is high on the \"do over\" list!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Had dinner with my boyfriend who has been here before. 
We had the lemon breeze to drink and they were tasty. 
We order appetizers from the happy hour half price menu and decided on the beef empanadas. They came out fast and were really good. 
My boyfriend ordered the carnitas rice bowl. The presentation was good and it was warm, starchy and tasted good
I ordered the fish tacos and was a little disappointed.  They weren't even luke warm.  Our friendly server, Lisa, offered to take them back and warm them, but I declined. I usually don't complain and never send food back because I'm afraid of what will be done to it.  
She left our table and returned shortly and said they were taking the fish tacos off the bill. Wow, that was really nice. 
I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ate at Bahama breeze Robinson twp tonight.... We have eaten there 50 times before with no problem.... Tonight my husband and I both ordered Cuban sandwiches which were funky tasting and really bad smelling... We send them back.... The manager assured us that they were fine..... Yuck..... He asked us to order something else....40 minutes later we received our new dinner and we were rewarded with a new check that was $20 more than the original would have been.... He never checked back.... I guess we were to blame for the funky pork..... Will never ever return...there are way too many great chain restaurants to frequent .... Bye bye Bahama breeze!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is a chain restaurant serving food and cocktails inspired by the Caribbean Islands. There is a traditional cocktail inspired from each island. The lemonade comes with a sugar cane stick in your glass, so you can chew on the sugar cane if you'd like. It adds an authentic touch to the sweet tasting drink.

Reverse happy hour from 9 PM to close is the best! It is half off all drinks and appetizers, getting you the most bang for your buck. There are a few appetizers with shrimp, but all are prepared differently. There are a variety of appetizers to choose from, including shrimp, chicken, and beef dishes.

There is live music as well at night, adding to the comfy island feel. This is a good place for a date night or even families, being open for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Tempted by Caribbean food we headed to Bahama Breeze.  What we really found was very bad Caribbean inspired chain restaurant food with fake enthusiastic waiters.

Everything is god awful.  Tasteless processed shrimp, fried chicken straight from the freezer bag, fake Caribbean food, obesity sized portions, to over bearing super enthusiastic waiter that just wants to sell sell sell... it was a disaster.  You could stick a knife in his gut and he would still smile and say that was the most thrilling fun he's had he ever had and then try to sell you a tasty signature yummy cocunut piss flavored drink.

For the first time ever, only half the food was eaten and doggie bags were clearly declined.  I felt so cheated, I honestly thought this was a non-chain, real caribbean restaurant."}
{"text":"The lobster and shrimp quesadillas are amazing! Absolutely delicious. I also highly recommend the hibiscus margarita. Very good!"}
{"text":"The good service, cool atmosphere, and tropical cocktails earns the place 2 stars. As for the food.. 1 star. Ordered the taste of Jamaica sampler platter. The only thing decent were the plantains. Jerk chicken was so dry you could sand with it. Pulled pork was so dry you could use it as a fire kindling. The rice was bland. And the greens were overcooked. Very disapointing. Seeing as 5yrs earlier I had eaten there and the food was great. Will return for the atmosphere and cocktails. But not the food..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  We always have great service and when we were there this week it was no exception. They used to serve a great chicken salad with their black bean and corn salsa, they took it off the menu a few years ago but they always make it special when we ask about it.  That is what I call service.

Prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly.  I wish they would bring this restaurant to Portland, Oregon!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, my first time there & was seated down immediately and food was quick! Didn't remember the name of our server but he was excellent"}
{"text":"Great food. Hard decision what to get, and even though our server was only \"4 days in\" he steered us in the right direction. Thanks Thomas!!!!! Nice atmosphere, music, food, and drinks."}
{"text":"I came here while one early afternoon while visiting Vegas. The food here is so flavorful. Seems like a great place for groups because there is a lot of space. The service was great as well. The waiter made sure our drinks never ran dry and that we had everything we needed and was very friendly. I got a sampler plate with empanadas, jerk chicken, and rice, and other yummy choices. Also tried the baby back ribs. Sooooooo good! I would love to try their seafood here."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite restaurants! Always seated right away and the environment reminds me of home

I don't think I'd actually get an entrée here but almost all their appetizers are big enough for 2 people to share. Of course, you should always come during their happy hour. Half off appetizers and drinks.

All the times I've been here, our server is always friendly and funny. I also love how it's near the strip but away from the madness. Definitely taking my family and friends here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"I actually really like the food and drink here. 5 stars for that! Liked it so much that I have been trying to bring my wedding party and guests here for our rehearsal dinner.  But 3 strikes for me is enough however.  Trying to book this has been the worst experience of planning our entire Vegas wedding. We have been put on hold for 10/20 min a time only to get someone that can't help us, doesn't want to help us, nor doesn't seem like they have any interest in working with us. Rude, don't care, unhelpful, constant runaround. Not a problem, we'll take the business of 25 guest we were going to come in with and enjoy food and drinks elsewhere. A little foolish on their end if you ask me... good luck with that attitude"}
{"text":"I just had my wedding reception there and the food and atmosphere is amazing! I was more than impressed with the quality of the food and wonderful service from the waiters that worked our party. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the happy hour. Prices and selection were decent, however service wasn't as great. After being seated, waited for 10-15 minutes until finally a waiter came by and apologized claiming that we were not in his section and that he would fill in for the server that was missing, maybe they got abducted by aliens or something? 

Anyway, the food was actually pretty good, ordered coconut shrimp, adobo chicken tacos for apps and mahi-mahi fish tacos as an entree. Each were flavorful, my favorite were the fish tacos, although the shrimp and chicken tacos were both close.

Other than the mishap at the beginning of my visit Bahama breeze was a good one!"}
{"text":"Love these places.  They are starting to replace Olive Garden as my go-to chain restaurant when traveling.  They have some nice lighter portions, and their food is very good and reasonably price. Most of their restaurants have someplace you can sit and hear yourself think.

This location is no exception.  I was very pleased with my appetizer (lump crab meat stack with avocado, shrimp, greens, and a very tangy sauce.)  My chicken main dish (a nice, right-sized, tasty platter for ONLY TEN BUCKS) was a very pleasant surprise.  The waitress was efficient and friendly.

General comment to BB management: I really mourn the loss of the corn fritters, they were out of this world."}
{"text":"Went their to get a pina colada, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! In fact, it was better than the ones my husband and I had while in the Bahamas; so kudos to Bahama Breeze!"}
{"text":"Another food chain that tries way to hard and misses the point of the food by over doing it! I had to dumb down the food I ordered because everything was just overboard, for example they had to much stuff in one dish that took away from the flavor of the food and my server was slow and kept doing a disappearing act. I'm going back for happy hr so I'll update again. I've been to several location in GA but you just never know what your going to get. Not my favorite restaurant at all!"}
{"text":"We were actually on the way to Olive Garden but were caught up by Bahama Breeze as there're many people setting at the porch at 5:30pm. We're first time here and found out they have happy hours 50% off on liquors and appetizers. Nobody taking care of us after we'd been setting at the table for 10mins. Finally a waiter named Gregory came to us explained and apologized for the wait. He also got us the 50% off appetizer (the wings) after happy hour. It's nicely handled. Despite the wait, the foods are great. We ordered the seafood paella, Jamaica chicken wings, and the BBQ ribs. 

The wings are really good, highly recommended! The paella has many ingredients in it; the size is quite large, good for parties of 2-3. The BBQ ribs are juicy and savory. We're glad that we did go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Foods great happy hour even better! You can get your drink inside a pineapple, or coconut!  How awesome is that, even procing isnt outrageous considering how close they are to the strip!"}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant ambience and food. Perfect place to relax with soothing live music, delicious food and great cocktails.

Need to mention especially about our server JD. He was so fun to talk to and made our decisions easy. He made the food even more delicious with the way he described them to us :). Employees like them make a place even more special.

Definitely order the jerk shrimp and Jamaican chicken. It's not like what we were used to in other places."}
{"text":"I was looking to get away from the Strip and all the pretentious,  way overpriced food there, when I stumbled upon this place. It was Tuesday afternoon, at least in the 80's. This place is a tropical themed place, with nice covered outdoor seating - perfect! There was a nice breeze & it wasn't  crowded, although I'm sure it is at happy hour & prime times.

Nice menu with carribean influenced items, and drinks. I had a great margarita, coconut shrimp & salad ( lunch special). Good value, and delicious. If I lived nearby, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Sehr lecker und nicht zu teuer. Die Tische im Aussenbereich sind etwas wackelig und schlecht ausgeleuchtet. Dennoch: Sehr empfehlenswert!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. The wait staff was great but the server is kinda d*%#.  I ordered coconut mojito drink and I asked for straw. He said \" that's the straw\" pointing to 2.5 inches of sugar cane stick. Next time I'll dare him to suck on that for $100 to finish my drink."}
{"text":"First dinning experience here. My wife is leaving 80% of her plate on the table. No flavor on the steak, under cooked broccoli, and sour mashed potatos. Save your money and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night at 7:30 place was about half way full and we were seated in front of a live singer, music was good, food was great and staff was even better.  Crowd was a little on the older side 45+ so next time we might come later.

Spinach dip was da bomb!"}
{"text":"I always receive great customer service definitely a favorite spot when looking for a place to sit and unwind.  They treat Vegas locals good."}
{"text":"Not great, I had a good experience my first time but on my second trip the empanadas were bland and the Mahi in my fish taco , wasn't even close to being done cooking... I mean completely raw and just sautéed. They comped the meal and gave a free dessert, but I'm pretty sure they messed up the check , either way I'll never be here again. Shame, I like the vacation atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour. Food and drinks were so delicious! The customer service was outstanding. Marcus was our waiter and made our first experience wonderful. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience and pricing better than restaurants  on the strip! I liked the island music and the relaxed vibe! I felt like I was on a tropical vacation. Lobster Mac and cheese was delicious and the drink in the pineapple hit the spot. I recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a chain restaurant. The theme is well executed and feels very authentic. The setting is casual and relaxed, but with enough ambient noise to make it kid friendly. Cuisine includes lots of chicken and seafood options. A \"lighter serving\" option is available for many meals, making for a cheaper - but still quite filling - meal. I didn't have high hopes going into this place, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and level of service. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new so we decided to give this place a try. It was such a great experience and a nice change to all the all you can eat places in town. The menu was mouth watering and so was the food. I had the Calypso Shrimp Linguine and the portion was so big that I had it to go. The waiter even added a little hand drawn picture of a sailing boat on top of my to go box which was kind of neat. My hubbie and I had the linguine for lunch the next day. I added green onions, sake and garlic to it and it was delicious! Our drinks were great too. Its not a surprise that this place was packed for a tuesday night. The only downside was the garlic bread. It was a little soggy. In all I think that this is a great place to hang out with friends or your significant other. Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Ahi stack looked like raw pink blobs on a plate and completely not appetizing. Within 2 minutes of getting appetizer the main dish was brought to table. Despite being piping hot, the shrimp in my bowl were nearly transparent and not well cooked at all. Manager tried to do right by us but not the first disappointing experience here . Will think long and hard before returning. Quality has taken a tumble over the years."}
{"text":"First time trying Bahama Breeze, and really enjoyed it.  Went to this location last Thursday.  Prompt service, with an personable and down-to-earth staff, fun and relaxed Caribbean atmosphere, great music, excellent food!  Ordered drinks and the Grilled Chicken with Cilantro Crema for myself, while my friend ordered ribs."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for my Dirty 30 birthday celebration. We had a party of 18 and I was trying to find a reasonably priced place with a large selection of choices. Thank goodness I picked Bahama Breeze! I tried to make a reservation a week or so in advance and was told to just call the morning of. I was a little skeptical but thought, ok fine, let's see. Called the morning of and got a reservation, no problem at all. Had to wait about 20 minutes once we got there for the table to be ready, and had to have them add more seats 3 times, for some reason they kept counting wrong. But all the staff was very sweet. Had two servers, one was named \"Red\", both were AWESOME! Took a while to get drinks out, but with 18 people that can be expected. My hubs and I had some Mojitos, the avocado crab stack, coconut shrimp, fish tacos and side salad with fruit vinaigrette. Everything was DELISH! I mean like super, awesome, very, very good!!!!!! They also let us each have separate checks which made paying SO much easier! Thank you Bahama Breeze for making my birthday dinner amazing! All 18 people loved their food and drinks, and that's not an easy task!"}
{"text":"drove by here so many times thinking I need to try that place out, finely did. Sat outside enjoying the band, dinner and a couple drinks. bartender gave great service and the empanadas were good. not quite as authentic as Jamaica but very close."}
{"text":"Love their Lemon Breeze Drink.. Ordered one Chef's special salmon for lunch.."}
{"text":"We love this place! Our family of 5 tries to eat here whenever we are in Vegas. The food and cocktails are awesome, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots: great food and even better service definitely coming back.....our server Donna was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I was seriously so disappointed by this place, we are locals and decided to try something new and hit up Bahama Breeze. They had a happy hour special so we got some half off appetizers, the carnita street tacos were good but that was the only good thing about this meal. My mans steak was filled with grissle and his mashed potatoes were generic. My jerk chicken pasta had nothing jerk about it and also very bland. So disappointed we spent $70 there!!!"}
{"text":"Let's preface this post with some crappy weather that ultimately was probably the downfall of our dinner. We were greeted by a server who didn't identify herself. She asked if we've been here before and I said not in a long while. She said, \"oh well, the drinks and food specials are in the front\". Monotone. Flat faced. And she walked away. I order our beverages. I actually lap timed how often she came back to us. The longest lap was 15 before ordering. In hop 2 bubbles chicks behind us trying the \"Thursday night special\" we weren't told about. I guess the promotion ends at 9, it was 8:55pm. Any who. While were there nearly an HOUR, the girls and our table get our food the same time. Sweet. I thought our lovely server forgot about us. Nope. She took our plates and promptly shuttered over herself to ask if we wanted anything before handing my check covered in some sort of sticky syrup which was over her hands. She was extremely nice when she handed me the check. Ya, know for a $50+ ticket and hoping for a 15-20% tip, you would THINK she'd be nicer. Nope. So, she got what she deserved. She made me feel like I inconvenienced her for doing her job. Wish it was better. Also Mgmt should take note that this restaurant needs a good DEEP cleaning. The window sills are disgusting. The menus need to be Lysoled & wiped down with bleach wipes. The carpet needs replacing. I can go on and on. But the most disappointing part of the evening was being treated \"less than\" the other guests by our server. Oh by the way, thank you Ashley S. for being one of the most unpleasant servers I've ever encountered. I only found her name on the actual receipt. 

PS if you smiled and were nice you would have gotten 20%."}
{"text":"We loved the Cuban Bread appetizer but they stopped serving it. The rest of the food is ok. The best thing about this place is the Chocolate Island desert. The wife likes the Mojitos."}
{"text":"Never thought we'd eat there as it's a bit off the Strip for some reason we ended up there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Employees were extremely friendly and accomodating, offering us advice on what's good on the menu -

The jerk chicken is awesome and so was the salmon salad. A lot of food for what you pay too! It was a Sunday afternoon so the atmosphere was pretty mellow - overall, a great find for lunch."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here and it was an amazing experience!!! Great food and wonderful staff, I'm so glad I chose this place!"}
{"text":"Came for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Before the rest of the family arrived, we sat at the bar and ordered apps and drinks. The pina coladas and lava flows were ON POINT. Thick, creamy, and not the least bit skimpy on the booze. The yucca fries and spinach dip were also pretty legit.

But then when we sat down at our table, the entrees were all appalling. I don't even remember what we ordered because nothing had any flavor. The décor is pretty cool though!"}
{"text":"Great fruity island drinks! Seafood dishes are absolutely fresh, not bad for a chain restaurant. Quick service, neat island style decor.  Try the blackened anything."}
{"text":"Had spicy jerk shrimp and almond crusted mahi. It was all very good and reasonably priced.  Cheap happy hour drinks as well."}
{"text":"For a chain, it was fine.  I was here for business and staying up the street.  We were seated right away, and the service was quick.  Our waitress was a little strange and over-friendly.  I had the chicken with cilantro crema.  It was better than I was expecting, but not spectacular.  If you need something cheap and fast, this place is fine."}
{"text":"Totally amazing.. me and my wife visited this restaurant  after a long day of shopping at the mall at Robinson .. it was excellent and we enjoyed the food a lot .. we are vegetarians but still we enjoyed this Carre bean sea food friendly restaurant  ... we loved the veggie sandwich and the especially the drinks we ordered . Painkiller I loved it :D"}
{"text":"Kurt was our fantastic server for lunch in the tropical area to the right of the entrance.  I always get a booth there cause it's cozy, & it puts a smile on mom's face, especially after chemotherapy.  The enclosed patio to the left of the entrance is very bright & also beautifully decorated, obviously has that Bahama feel.  On a rainy day, it was perfect for mom & I.  

Two of my favorites that I've never gone wrong with:

Jerk Shrimp w/ Cuban bread is the best, best, best.  I have had their appetizer sampler which was very filling also, but I highly recommend the Jerk Shrimp over that if you're hungry.  

On the lighter, yet EXTREMELY good side is their Avocado stuffed Crabmeat salad!  Real crab meat & lots of it, stuffed into one avocado.  The salad is light & flavorful.  I love it & crave it all over again just writing this.  Next time, I'm gonna ask for extra crab, no salad cause I don't eat too many tomatoes & there's a lot.  

Also a reminder to self, Margarita Flight or Sampler!  I have to try this next time.  I usually get the KJ Chardonnay.  

Our server Kurt was friendly, helpful, & although it was packed & super busy, he was always there.  Immediately got a knife to cut mom's Apple Bacon Cheddar Burger (she loved it), & a to-go box.  He also offered suggestions off of the menu & overall made our day.  Thank you Kurt, we will be back in your section.  

Just a month before, dad & I sat at the bar & the bartender was not so nice.  I thought I am only sitting in the dining area here from now on & I am glad we did."}
{"text":"I really would like to give them a 4.5, but I really can't give them a 5.  We started with drinks & appetizers:  Rumrunner for the wife, a mojito for me, with coconut shrimp and conch fritters.  Rumrunner was delicious, but the mojito was not tasty and not well executed (mint wasn't muddled, lime wedges were un-squeezed and rock-hard, and it had crushed ice instead of cubes).  Shrimp and conches were both delicious, but they had the same sauce, which is a very minor criticism.

We had our minds on paella, which we ordered, and after all the fried stuff, we wanted something vegetable-y, which was not on the menu (unless you count salads, which we were not in the mood for).  On inquiring we were informed that there were broccoli, green beans, and asparagus available, of which we ordered the first two.  To our surprise and delight, the vegetables were nicely cooked and delicious.  The paella was awesome, especially considering they did not skimp on the seafood.  My wife didn't like the style of rice, but I thought it was appropriate.  It was also too much for us, and we ended up taking it home.  Since I'm writing this the day after our visit and I just had a fairly large portion of paella leftovers, I can report that it was maybe even better the next day.  

Back to our visit, we were too full for dessert, so I just ordered an Irish coffee, which even after I verified that they would make it the proper way (coffee, Irish whiskey, and whipped cream), the waiter came back with this drink that he said had Kahlua in it, which I summarily sent back whence it came, which I felt they could have been a little more apologetic about.  The real drink, when it came back, kind of had an aftertaste like bottom-shelf spirits. 

The ambiance was nice.  There was a musician playing tropical-themed music, which we quite enjoyed.  The service was fairly good but not superb; no complaints."}
{"text":"Amazing service. We were greeted and spoken to by every employee we saw: the hostess, the busser, the servers, the food runner. Everyone was super nice and friendly. Honestly, some of the best customer service I've received in a restaurant ever.

The jerk chicken wings are tasty...unfortunately its not spicy whatsoever. They really need to kick up the heat on them. 

On two occasions, we got the Cuban Sandwich. Its large with plenty of meat. The second time we got it, the sandwich had lettuce and tomatoes on it, which we didn't like. But its really a good sandwich.

Get the Breeze salad. It has a delicious dressing...salty, sweet and sour all in one. The real star, though, is the pumpkin seeds.

The rice and beans are good, though on both occasions, they were not hot when they got to the table, just warm.

We also got the tostones, which are fried plantains with a topping. These were not too good. There's not enough topping for all of the tostones and they're dry. There's no dipping sauce or anything, either. They were kind of bland.

The price is a little higher  than average but its manageable as long as you stay away from  the pricier items."}
{"text":"This is a MUST stop here if there is one close! So delicious! We came with a party of 19 and had at least 9 kids with us. They were very accommodating and everyone single person in out party loved their food, including the kids! After trying our appetizers we began to share food, because everything was seriously soooooooo good. For an appetizer, order the Jamaican jerk wings, they are the best wings and cooked perfectly. They have a happy hour after 9 with half off appetizers and special drinks, so well worth it. Fresh lemonades made with real fruit and shaken for you. Really delicious! Kids pasta is great and serving size is big. Salads are huge also. Really, nothing bad to say about this place, food came fast, great live music and friendly staff.
Also had the empanadas, coconut shrimp, fire cracker shrimp (my personal favorite), ribs, jerk chicken pasta, shrimp and grits, steak and crab stacks. I'm sure there was more but bottom line everything was good. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unique dishes with beautiful presentations.  Decent prices.  Virgin Bahamarita is a good drink.  Good for groups.  2 Blocks from the strip."}
{"text":"Where do i begin, this place is FANTASTIC, the decor is beautiful. Takes up the corner spot in a large shopping center, big parking lot. Came in Fri 1/15/16 around 8:00pm, the lot was full but to our surprise there was no wait, the restaurant is huge. The staff are great our waiter Fred came over within a minute of our sitting down and gave us a rundown of the best & most popular drinks & dishes since this was our first visit. My daughter that doesnt drink, loves strawberry lemonade and orders it whenever its on a menu, she says this was the best shes EVER had. All i can say is this place is now in my top 5 of places to have a great \"experience\" meal. To me, the prices are low for the quality & quantity of food we received, if it were more i wouldnt complain. We were so stuffed couldnt try dessert. They do have small plates so we might do that with drinks next time so that we can try those delicious looking desserts."}
{"text":"Had the ahí and the sauce on it killed the taste of the ahí. Had the chowder very tasty! Need to serve with something other than oyster crackers!"}
{"text":"The drinks were really good, probably better than the food. I had the jerk chicken sandwich and fries. The sandwich was ok and they really didn't give me that much fries. I might try this place again but try something else."}
{"text":"This place is the theme restaurant of all theme restaurants! You definitely feel like you're not in Ohio when you walk inside. The decor is interesting and the staff is nice. 

My boyfriend ordered a flight of rum drinks and really enjoyed them. I got a pineapple mojito and it was just okay. 

We got the jerk chicken wings for an app and they were awesome! But our actual meals were really just okay. 

In addition, our server seemed very overwhelmed and mentioned having tables across the restaurant. Therefore we were checked on pretty rarely. 

Lastly, the place was pretty pricey, even considering the drinks and app. 

Overall, we wouldn't run back to this place"}
{"text":"Love Bahama Breeze, whether it is in Orlando or Las Vegas. However, the first time I ever dined at one was in Orlando. 

This is a fabulous restaurant and it has a great ambiance. It truly reminds me of a meal in the Bahamas. The only thing missing were the geckos on the walls. 

Food is great, service is ok. Decor is perfect.

and yes.....  I know it is a chain.  I typically shun chains and like all chains it will probably go down the big spiral.  But for now, I like it!"}
{"text":"I had a gift card for Bahama Breeze that I got on my birthday and I had forgotten until one day I drove by and decided it was the perfect time to use it. I was solo so decided to seat at the bar and blend in into the party ambiance, although not planned that way I landed there during happy hour which gave my gift card extra buying power.
As I waited patiently at the bar a couple sat by me and were instantly acknowledged and asked if they wanted drinks, they ordered two mojitos and the bartender left to make them, when she came back with their drinks she asked them if they were ready to order, it was then that I realized I have the power of being invisible if no one is looking. I sort of interrupted and asked if I could have a drink and that I was ready to order, she took their order and then took mine giving me that \"can't you wait for your turn? look\"
I ordered the paella which was very good although not authentic for it was made with long grain rice but the result was the same, a delicious zafron rice dish loaded with seafood! I also got the coconut shrimp with some kind of sweet n sour sauce that was equally delicious as the paella, there are also many more items on the menu that I would love to try like the Jamaican chicken or firecracker shrimp they both sounded good I just didn't have the belly space but I'm working on expanding.
The setting is also very nice, the building is like a large plantation house very spacious with high ceilings and nice breezy caribbean atmosphere with indoor and outdoor sections.   
The waitress returned to ask the people by my side if everything was ok, they asked her if she could take their picture and I took advantage of the opportunity and asked her for my check hoping not to interrupt a perfect customer waitress relation.
 I'm definitely coming back..what else can I ask for? Awesome fun and clean environment, excellent delicious food and outstanding service...........for the couple sitting next to me!"}
{"text":"Service was nearly non-existent. Employees were noticeably disinterested or awkwardly unhappy. Quality of the food was comparable to fast food. 
 
I keep hearing good things about this place, but I was disappointed. They sat us in the patio area. The patio is a nice open window area with a gas fireplace in the center. The fire creates a nice mood and the fresh air is lovely. However, its not the greatest on a warm day. Also you can smell the gas or propane that fuels the fire when down wind. It can be nauseating after a while. Our server is a nice guy, but noticeably disinterested. We place our order with an appetizer. The appetizer is delivered but utensils or napkins were not provided. We flagged an employee, and let him know we didn't have any napkins or utensils. A few minutes later he produced a handful of cocktail napkins. We needed to flag another person for the rest. The appetizer tasted horrible. Ahi tuna should not have a heavy fish flavor. Our main order was delivered by an individual who was not amused by our misunderstanding of what he said when asking \"who ordered what\". It was clear that he was quite unhappy with this duty. I had ordered a Cuban sandwich. It tasted fine, but was ordinary. You can find the same quality at any subway or port of subs. Nothing impressive. We decided we had enough and requested the check...I can still taste the tuna, it was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I could live off the buttermilk fried chicken breasts, so good. And don't forget my bahamarita!!! My only complaint is that there not one closer to my house. Devin is a great quick and friendly server. The best! Gotta come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Good food . I went for happy hour . Was surprised at how extensive the happy hour food menu was . I ate a lot for cheap lol"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner at Bahama Breeze at the suggestion of a good friend who's a regular. I was pleased to open the menu and find so many healthy options. The calories are listed with each menu item which is so awesome for us calorie counters!  I'm back to eating healthy and working out on a regular basis. I can definitely see myself having another healthy dinner here again especially after a good work out. This would also be a great place to grab a drink and to eat on your day off from counting calories.

I'd recommend trying the chicken tortilla soup(110 calories) and the grilled chicken and fresh fruit salad(660 calories)."}
{"text":"Buttermilk chicken is outstanding. I mean comfort food at its finest. The crab, shrimp, mango avocado stack is great. The chicken kabobs are really nice but kind of plain. Something about their yellow rice is quite tasty. The lobster and shrimp linguine is a huge portion and the brandy cream sauce is sweet and finishes well. Their tomato salad is great. I always get the Lemon Breeze lemonade drink here too. Chocolate Island makes a great ending."}
{"text":"We came here for date night, but unfortunately left disappointed. We ordered the chips and \"salsa\" but what we got was chips and bruschetta. We both ordered steak -mine medium and my husband got well done. We were served our meals that look small, but were almost average size on huge plates however the steaks were undercooked (we were given a medium rare and a medium) the steak was tough, chewy and under seasoned. My husband and I were both upset because of the great reviews but we both ultimately left dissatisfied and still hungry. 
Also, double check the bill- they calculate the tip after taxes are added. 
I'm only giving it 2stars because our server was really nice and the drinks were great (ultimate pineapple and pina colada).
Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is probably one of the best casual eateries to eat at in Las Vegas for a mid-price point. It is two blocks from the Strip, just far enough to spare you from the chaotic traffic but close enough that you can ride-share to it; and if location isn't enough to sell you, their happy hour will.

With $5 Wines, $5 Well Drinks, and half-off appetizers what is not to love? My highlights were their Jamaican Chicken Wings and Coconut Shrimp paired with a Frozen Bahamarita. They have something for everyone, their menu ranging from dishes of all sizes.

TIP: If you're going to eat here over the summer (which is like May through September in Las Vegas) make sure you are seated in the main dining room and not in either of the patios because while the tropical decor is to die for, you will literally die from the heat"}
{"text":"Delishhhhh!!!!! Food was amazing!!! Service was fabulous!! Would totally recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  It has a good menu, different from other Pgh menus.  We go here often, and I usually get the Cobb salad, its great.  On Tuesday I tried the coconut shrimp tacos, they were so good!  The spicy shrimp appetizer is my favorite.  The restaurant is pretty, we have always had good servers. If you have to wait they have a lovely waiting area, it is just always an enjoyable experience to dine here."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place but I had not had a chance to try it. I was on my way to eat brunch on the strip when I saw this place. My friend and I decided to eat here instead because there was plenty of parking and it had good reviews on yelp.

We started off ordering the panko onion rings as an appetizer, They were pretty good, I'm not a fan of panko bread crumbs but my friend is so we got them. We also got a side caesar salad, It was so light and delicious. It also had shaved pieces of parmesan cheese and the croutons tasted homemade. 

For the entree, we decided to split the Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the menu said it had shrimp in every bite so I needed to see if that was true. I love shrimp so I had to try it. They gave us the plate and there was a lot of shrimp, I mean, a lot! It was awesome! The linguine was perfectly cooked al dente, the pasta was sauteed with garlic, onion and tomatoes with a hint of spice and cream. The amount of cream was perfect and not overwhelming and there literally was shrimp in every bite. Pastas are usually topped with shrimp, this one also had shrimp in between. It was so good and the price was awesome! $18.00 for a large portion which my friend and I could not finish. We left some pasta, I ate all the shrimp and enjoyed every single one of them.

The desserts looked yummy but we could not try them because we were stuffed. 

I love this place, hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great mojito.  Very authentic and a nice size.
Service was very attentive in the bar on a very busy night with sports all over."}
{"text":"This restaurant is decent. The appetizers are quite good, but there aren't too many great options available for lunch or dinner entrees.  One nice thing is that there usually isn't too long of a wait at this location, even on weekend nights."}
{"text":"The crab cakes and Jamaican chicken wings weren't good. The lobster shrimp quesadilla was really good. The mojito is stellar and the martini was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is an overpriced chain food restaurant with a tiny dining area. Their wrap around porch is pretty sweet, except they totally built a tiny dining area to force you to wait for over an hour on the porch buying expensive syrupy cocktails. 

The best part: the porch overlooks the parking lot that is I-271."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and had two decent meals. Everything tasted good both times.  Just recently had the fish tacos.  They weren't the best I've ever had, but the tilapia was cooked well and they had fresh toppings on them.  So, uh yeah, it's good."}
{"text":"I had made reservations so I could easily get in but when we arrive the place was super dead and I was surprise actually. We sat on the patio area and it was relaxing, had awesome music as well. I didn't like the fact that I had to ask for silverware and I asked twice to have a booster seat for my child. They were very friendly though. I believe they are more known for there drinks rather then there food. The food was ok. I had a jerk chicken sandwich with asparagus. I had the pineapple drink which was amazing at least. They never came back to ask for refills or anything. I wasn't that impressed really I only gave stars because my drink was awesome. I will only go for drinks most likely and not food."}
{"text":"Happy Hour experience at the bar tonight - Ordered a Red Sangria which was 90% ice and 10% wine due to the wine glass being really small and filled to the rim with ice.  Noticed others were asking for light on the ice when ordering drinks.  A couple next to me complained about the drinks being all ice too.  People have obviously caught on.  They definitely rip you off on the drinks, even during happy hour.  Sangria was not part of happy hour so I paid $6 for a sangria that I finished in four sips.  Ordered the grilled chicken which was burnt and dry.  Overall a bad experience and never going back."}
{"text":"Read about your establishment on your news about racial profiling a group of black sororities. Calling the police on them and assuming some members of the party would not pay. Shame on you. That is a terrible way to be in 2018. You know nowadays of the repercussions of unnecessarily involving the police when dealing with minority ethnic groups in business establishments. Way to make yourselves look terrible. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"loved their chicken wings!!!
coconut shrimp was yummy!


love the caribbean theme!--"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place mostly for their amazing happy hour!

First of all it's a bahama themed restaurant for eating island favorites, tapas, and even drinking. I'm a big fan of their appetizers alone. During happy hour, all appetizers are half off so that's what my friends and I usually do. They also have a to-go menu for those on a tight schedule and wanna grab and go. 

This is to get an idea of their schedule:
Store Schedule // Sunday - Saturday: 11AM - 12AM
Happy Hour // Monday - Friday: 4PM - 6PM
Late Night Happy Hour // Sunday - Thursday: 9PM - 12AM

Happy Hour includes these appetizers to much on (and the portions are pretty big):
-Beef Empanadas
-Firecracker Shrimp
-Chicken Quesadilla
-Firecracker Shrimp Street Tacos 
-Pork Carnitas Street Tacos 
-Adobo Chicken Street Tacos 
-Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla 
-Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp 
-Coconut Shrimp
-Jumbo Lump Crab Stack 
-Warm Spinach Dip and Chips 
-Jamaican Chicken Wings Tostones with Chicken 
-Crispy Onion Rings 
-Habanero Chicken Wings

SO MUCH VARIETY HONESTLY. GOOD PRICE FOR GREAT QUALITY!

The place is clean, especially their bathroom, and I've heard their drinks are pretty amazing (they also have hand-crafted drinks for happy hour).

I recommend this place if you're hungry at night and looking for something cheap for big amounts to fill you up! Also, just go to their happy hour!"}
{"text":"3.5  Stars is A-OK.  I really enjoy coming here.  The service is pretty good, the staff has been really friendly.  Son that is always a huge plus.

The food is different from other local spots.  It has been really tasty.  The portions always seem small when it arrives, but still end up very full.

The drinks, alcoholic and non are always very well made and tasty.

My recommendation is the Jerk Chicken.  It is really good."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place.Quality and taste of food is horrible.I remember 5 years ago it was amazing.I used to have to ask them to make anything jerk not so spicy.Now it seems they don't use any seasoning.The jerk chicken was very bland and dry.Empanadas tasted microwaved and service is just not what it used to be.My favorite local place is now trash."}
{"text":"We just gave this restaurant a second chance this evening. 
It had been about three years since our last experience, be ause the food was mediocre at best and the service was poor. 

We hoped for a better experience and received what we hoped for.....but just barely. The food was still mediocre. The service was slightly better. They had pleasant entertainment. 
However, and sadly, it was not enough to bring us back again. 
Shame.  I did so like the outdoor dining porch."}
{"text":"4 stars because the drinks, customer service, and atmosphere are great. I would give the food 2.5-3 stars, though. It's really hit and miss. The food has really good flavor, but I think the ingredients are on the cheaper side. Drinks are seriously amazing though!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my friend and I had the best experience out there. The food was fantastic the crowd is lovely and F.J the manager made sure our food and experience turned out as expected . Our waitress Sarah was also very kind and helpful when it came down to explaining the menu. Over all I give this restaurant a 5/5 make sure to go in and check them out, guaranteed a wonderful experience and great food!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I probably would have given it 4-5 stars. The food was delish, service was excellent, and the had a bunch of good signature cocktails. Like alot of other places when they get popular, food, and service suffer. Went a couple days ago after not going for like 2 years and I just wasn't impressed with anything. Im mean it was still OK; but not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Ate here about a week or two ago and I got to say the food here is pretty good I had a party of 4 people with me and the service was exceptional they always came by to ask us if there was anything we needed they came by to give us refills each time and they were very friendly and courteous which made me feel really comfortable as for the food it was really good I had a couple of my friends appetizers and some of her dessert I also had the fried chicken sandwich and it was really delicious and I might think of trying it again overall I see myself coming back here as the atmosphere it really comfortable and I like the setting and the energy of the servers it is pretty pricey in my opinion but it is worth because the food taste that good."}
{"text":"We came with our three kids last night.  We had a great waitress (Jewel).  The one challenge we have going out with our kids are their allergies (several).  This is one of our main criteria evaluating places now.  This place was great addressing our kids issues.  The waitress was somewhat knowledgeable, but when she wasn't, she quickly grabbed a manager who answered our questions.  We finished ordering, and she came back five minutes later and told us that one of the items my daughter ordered did have Gluten.  We quickly changed that.

The overall food and prices were very reasonable for what we got.  We did have a manager stop by a couple times to see how we were doing.  

Now, it was a little loud and the food delivery was not really consistent.  I do agree with another reviewer that the front desk hostesses could be a little more pleasant, but overall, we did have a very good time at dinner.  We never tried this restaurant before and we have one in the city where we live, so we'll give that one a try soon.

But, in this one, our server made the evening great."}
{"text":"After hearing how great the happy hour is via yelp reviews, we decided to stop in. I had a free appetizer from the Yelp Elite event that was near expiring as well! The happy hour menu was definitely affordable and they had a wide variety of options. We got the nachos, chicken quesadilla and habanero wings. The chicken quesadilla was my top pick. I wanted to like the nachos more, but they were kind of cold and mushy :( and I was really looking forward to those! I only had a few chips before deciding that the calories were not worth the taste. Drinks were strong! Service started off bad (ignored for 15 minutes) but then redeemed when we were greeted by Josh. He was super attentive and checked on us often but not TOO often. He was also very sweet to take off the most expensive app whereas most people would take off the least expensive app."}
{"text":"Delicious food but this review is solely for the rum cake dessert. OMG, the tastiest and strongest butterscotch rum sauce (came w raisins) I've ever had. Thee best. Didn't even need to order a cocktail after. Amazing, ha. Mini bundt rum cake is delicious and moist as well - they might even inject it with a rum simple syrup after it's baked. YUM"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. Dined there back in April for my wifes birthday! Sent letter to their home office at that time.Never heard back from anyone. Upon dining our server Shannon was fantastic. Suggested a few drinks. We ordered bahamaritas and the island onion rings. This all came out great. We sat.at booth in the bar. I ordered.the island burger w fries. My wife ordered one of their bowls. I observed the fries sitting in a bowl for over 20 mi. A mgr appeared to be getting food out, however he looked confused and just walked away leaving the window full of food. Our food finally arrived about 30 min later. The fries were now ice cold and disgusting ...my burger was blackened char and tasted as.such. i ask for a mgr who arrives 10 min later. I show him my black hockey puck of a.burger. His reply \"my bad\" ??? No genuine apology only an offer of a bowl of soup??? All the while the GM is glaring at us from the kitchen ,never.to make contact with us."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze Grilled Chicken, TO DIE FOR! So so good, and my boyfriend ALWAYS orders, Calypso Shimp Linguine....LOVE BAHAMA BREEZE MY FAVORITE!   VERY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with both the food and service!   I ordered grilled halibut with mango sauce.  When it finally arrived it was no longer hot, and even with the sauce, it was so dry it was like eating a crunchy newspaper.  
The two other people with me ordered starter plates that sat in front of them long after they were finished.  Presumably this was when our order should have been put into the cook?
The waiter came to ask how our food was when one person had already finished and the other almost so.  I told him what was wrong and he offered to replace it, but it was too late.  : /  Sad to have not enjoyed my meal - but the company was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Food is fairly average. Nothing special. Slow service. Took almost 30 mins to get our food on what looked like a slow day."}
{"text":"Did the happy hour which is cheap and appetizers was really good specially the avocado with shrimp and crab meat and mangoes delish!!!!!! We also ordered chicken wings with BBQ sauce dip, spinach and chips and shrimp poppers... and my favorite drink was Virgin Bahamaritas (strawberry and kiwi slush yum)"}
{"text":"First time here for happy hour and got coconut shrimp and jumbo lump crab stack, soooo good! Definitely coming back for more Mon-Fri 4-6pm"}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off for years.  The menu seems to have changed but the one thing that has absolutely remained the same is their Mojito.  

The Mojito is made from fresh pressed sugar cane and it muddled to perfection.  THe standard comes with a light rum.  After your second or third start to experiment with some of the other rums...perhaps a dark one."}
{"text":"Great restaurant .. Amazing food and happy hour $3 -20oz beers ...Local place , great for your budget Dione our server was one of the best serve that I have had...if you want to eat and drink cheap this is a must ... Don't spend money on the strip go here it's well worth your money and it brings you to the Bahamas"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience here for a networking happy hour during a recent conference! We were able to rent their deck space, which was very cute, and had really good service. The food and drinks were good too. Everyone in our group of 40 or so seemed to have a good time!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant!!

We came here after we prepped all our models for a show and it was a fabulous place to eat.  It was more of a carribean type dining experience!

We asked to be seated outside since we smokers and their deck was still sort of indoors.  But airy enough for us to smoke.  There was live music playing, a bar in the deck area, and another deck for larger reservations/parties.  I was impressed on the decor already.  I'm a sucker for restaurants that are interesting to look at, sometimes I go with not so interesting people to eat. hehehe

Anyhooo...as soon as we sat, we were asked about drinks.  I ordered a mojito, but I should have gotten the Bahama Mama margarita...It looked dramatic as it tasted. DAMMIT!!! But nevertheless, my mojito was still delicious!!!

Apetizers:  Coconut shrimp....HOT AS HELL (temp wise) which meant it was freshly cooked!!! HMMMM to die for....

My plate:  Chicken Kabobs!!!  OH my god it was the best kabobs ever.  Chicken was cooked with red and green bell peppers, whole mushrooms, and red onions.  The kabobs were served over \"island rice\".  

SO GOOOD!! I toook it home to the hotel and saved it for the next nite!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night & I absolutely enjoyed the food and drinks! Friendly waiter as well"}
{"text":"I visited Bahama Breeze with my boyfriend on August 24th. A friend of his recommended the spot to us. Since it was off the Vegas strip we were seated right away. Our waitress was Jaime. She was very attentive and polite. She had asked us if we had been there before so she could properly introduce us to the menu and even made a few suggestions. I ordered coffee and mentioned I was tired and Jaime frequently stopped by to check if I needed more coffee. 
I ordered their fish tacos with fries. I really enjoyed their spread for the tacos it had a nice zing to it. The entree came with 3 tacos so it is a large serving. My boyfriend order the chicken and mashed sweet potatoes. YUM!
The restaurant is huge. Tall ceilings and lots of sectioned off seating areas with different decor, which made it visually appealing. There was lots of seating in the hostess area as well. I thought the wooden beach chairs were a nice touch.
I would definitely return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Items selected:

- Key West Fish Tacos
- Island Hopper: Jamaican chicken wings, conch fritters, coconut shrimps, onion rings

While the food quality met our minimum expectation, cleanliness fell short. Our server was throwing her towel to the table and sprayed the cleanser from a distance, the vaporized mist almost got to my table... The floor and the seat was not clean either.

And no wonder, they got shut down by the SNHD right after our visit.

Gross."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Bahama Breeze!  Stopped in with my family to have lunch and as usual, everything was just Great!  Nachos on point, Margaritas Amazing, Seafood Chowder hit the spot, and the Steak was great, love the sauce!  The service is always good there, and I love the decor!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with our experience here. When we were sat down we waited for a long time to for the waiter to come to our table. When he did show up we ordered 2 sodas but never received any water. The sodas took forever as well and when we finally got them they were watered down and Flat. We ordered an appetizer and when they brought it to the table they just dropped it off without even paying attention we didn't have any silverware or plates. More waiting finally I just got up and got silverware from another table and went hunting for a waiter to bring plates so we could eat our food. By that time I was over the entire experience and just wanted to eat and go home."}
{"text":"I think Olive Garden could have made a better fish taco. One ounce of cold white fish tucked into a stale flour tortilla with some cabbage. Nope! The second star is for the tortilla soup I got before the tacos, that was pretty delish. Normally I try to give a place the benefit of the doubt but my dining mates described their dishes as \"this doesn't do rice a roni justice\" and \"seems like boiled salad.\" Sorry Bahama Breeze, step it up!"}
{"text":"Meh. Got the shrimp linguine. The servings were large, but nothing had much flavor and it wasn't the best value"}
{"text":"Good food, Good service, Great environment and Fair Prices. Last minute reservation and they were still able to get us a table for our party of 11."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their happy hours special! Of course, their food is not as fresh as you think, but if you're craving a better option than Wendys or McDonalds, then this place isn't as bad. You have to be careful as well, I got my entree plate half-way done. How could you cook chicken half-way done? The manager on-site apologized for the mistake and comped the meal, however I wish they didn't make that mistake, so I could've enjoyed my meal. Will try my better luck next time."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of Yard House.  Similar food items.  We had the wings, beef empanadas, shrimp quesadilla, and the ahi.  The ahi was the most tasty thing."}
{"text":"I have visited Bahama Breeze a lot over the years. I have had varying levels of service and food qualify, but it has always been corrected if I had an issue and I have had more good experiences than bad. My favorite dish is the buttermilk fried chicken breast. I also like the onion rings and their dipping sauce is great. When I'm not ordering the fried chicken breast, I like the chipotle beef bowl. Their drink menu is great and I recommend the Zombie and the Painkiller."}
{"text":"even thou BB is a chain eatery  really like the food. i try to visit when in LV and really enjoy the food and service. all the appetizers are very good and if visit during HH are worth the money for sure. plenty of beer, wine etc buy i like the Bahamarita. 1 more tip........ ask for CHRISTINE  to be ur server. she has served us several times and is always friendly, helpful and a JOY to be around while in LV and the BB."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant during a family reunion.  I knew that we were a large group and I knew that it may take a bit longer but the time that it took for my drinks and my food to arrive was just ridiculous and we were the last table to be served when we were the first to have our order taken.  This is not the kind of service that I would wish for anyone and there would be no recommendation give to anyone ever"}
{"text":"It's so lovely here!!!! The inside is beautiful. Came here for the first time with a friend on Cinco De Mayo and I will say it felt very tropical here. We got there during happy hour so all appetizers were half off and the regular margaritas were $5. Everything was delicious. We ordered the nachos and the jerk chicken wings. Everything was enjoyable and had much flavor. 
The bad news was as we were paying for our check, the couple in the booth behind us frantically got up stating there was a huge flying roach on the window seal. I didn't stay long enough to see it. My friend and I both got up and paid our check in the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking for a light lunch and found the lobster shrimp quesidilla on the appetizer menu. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I've come here during Happy Hour twice now and will continue to come back for the great food, wonderful drinks, and quality service. This is the only Bahama Breeze in Pittsburgh (I believe the next closest one is in King of Prussia) so it doesn't feel like a chain to me. My favorite drink is the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula featuring rum, Reisling and pineapple juice. So good! I recently tried the Skillet-Simmered Jerk Shrimp which was AMAZING! The shrimp is served in a mini skillet in a wonderful juice blend of thyme, garlic, and veggies with a mini loaf of Cuban bread to dip into the skillet juice. This is one of the best dishes I ever had!

You can either eat indoors or outdoors. On a beautiful day, I definitely choose the outdoors. The only thing that would make the scenery ideal is a real ocean breeze and ocean to hear and overlook as you dine."}
{"text":"Best food since we have been in Vegas. Family friendly, affordable.  Very friendly service.   The coconut shrimp was to die for.   The coconut shrimp tacos blew my mind."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday & Monday (2/13 & 2/14)

I absolutely love this place.

I think I love the service more than ever. They have the best friendliest staff ever! (I know I sounded like a little kid over exaggerating) But, honest to God. You cannot find that type of service in LA.

This is like my favorite lunch spot in Vegas.

The plates are a hit and miss. Depends on what you order and if you know what you're ordering. 

Good luck and enjoy the good food. Cause there sure aren't any in LA.

*Get the cilantro cream sauce for dipping its grrrrrrrrrrrrreat!*"}
{"text":"I've always loved Bahama Breeze and this location is no exception.  The coconut shrimp and seafood chowder soup is my favorite.  The fish tacos looked awesome and is on my list for next time.  The service was friendly and quick too.  Love the tropical drinks especially the painkiller and coconut mojito."}
{"text":"Eh, I've had a lot better food at other chain restaurants in the area.  See, the problem here is that all of the food is simply reheated rather than cooked on location.  I asked that they hold the zucchini on my veggie sandwich at lunch- the server said they couldn't because it is what comes in the bag.  Now, I know that a lot of chain restaurants get their food delivered in bags, but don't tell me about it.  Just say that it is premixed or something.  Keep me in my ignorant bliss for just a few minutes.

But, that does speak volumes about the wait staff.  They are never very good at this location.  When you sit at the bar during lunch, you can hear them all complaining about everything from customers to the manager.  

For the price, you can do much better in the area- there's about 100 restaurants within 5 miles of this joint."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant several times and have always received very good service and food in a good environment. My last visit was on a Wednesday night at about 930-10pm. We were greeted and seated well. 

Then came the most flamboyant black male waiter ever. For some reason he completely lost it when I inquired about the chicken quesadilla. He told me they weren't that good and I still decided to try them. He then, while rolling his eyes, said,\" so you're going to try something and then send it back if you don't like it, AFTER I just told you it's not that good?\" I replied,\"yes!\" 

So the food was bought to the table and the food was freshly cook, and quesadilla was good. There were two male waiters that for some reason were extra loud and at times inappropriate. For example this waiter at my table continued to make it obvious that he was addressing my girlfriend alone, right from the moment he first approached the table. 

At some point, I'll return to the restaurant but they lost points with me. We were having a great night and this experience with the waiter messed the vibe up, completely."}
{"text":"It's like a trip to the Bahamas but a lot cheaper and quicker. Our favorite restaurant in greater Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"My Island oasis in the middle of Sin City.  We come here every time we come to Vegas.  I know you have no clue who \"we\" are.... but my whole family.  We plan where we are going to stay, club and when we are going to eat at Bahama Breeze.

Let's start with the Cons.... there isn't a location in Southern California.  Then again, id probably spend my rent money eating there all the time.  

The Service: Is always wonderful. Haven't had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always helpful and pleasant.  So cheers to them!

The Atmosphere: Wonderful!  For someone who has been to the \"islands\" this place is a good representation.  From the ceiling fans to the music being played.  Not loud, but mellow music.  Helps the food go down better... screw the sugar.

The Food:  OMG! Even if everything else was horrible the Food is so good you'd ignore it.

Jerk Chicken- my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  They have the perfect amount of jerk flavoring and are fried or baked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.  We made a mistake of sharing an order. Bad idea.  These are too good to share.

Beef Patties- Yummy! If flavor and good food aren't you thing... steer clear of this option. Truly a mouth satisfying appetizer.

Seafood Paella-So I have had Paella at a number of locations and this is one of the best.  The whole dish is a burst of happiness in your mouth.  I've had this 2 of the last 3 times I went here.  Everything else just doesn't seem to catch my eye.....

Always too full for dessert..... maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great drinks, Servers are polite and well informed. The food is average-great, depending what is ordered.  Have seldom had anything that disappointed.  I don;t recall ever saying to my friends - \"That was FABULOUS!!\"  It's a fun place to meet friends, yet quite noisy at certain times of the day.  I DO always feel like I am on VACA in the Caribbean when I am there.  WONDERFUL ambiance!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The service is fast, the food is delicious ~ try the jerk wings :)
The drinks are tasty.. we have never had bad service or meal coming here. The atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for meal, waiter was always within five feet of us (seemed creepy) and they don't even have tarter sauce! How do you serve fish and not have tarter sauce?!"}
{"text":"I normally don't love chains but didn't have much choice coming into Pittsburgh late. The food was fantastic. Very flavorful and fresh.
They don't actually take reservations but they put you on a running list \"in case.\" Didn't really get that but we didn't wait anyway at 830pm. 
Service was very polite and helpful. 
We started with the baked goat cheese appetizer stuffed into bell peppers with crostini. Unbelievable! I had the Chicken Santiago which was also very good and my colleague had the almond-crusted mahi mahi special with mashed sweet potatoes. Very fresh and perfectly cooked.
If I'm in the area again I will probably go back."}
{"text":"Thank you EARL.... we went out for a 6 person work dinner/drinks and he killed it with service. Theres not a lot of wait staff in the area thats good. We loved him!!!! He also seperated our checks and we didnt have to wait to long for our drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years. Don't know why we've waited so long to come back. Great menu and great atmosphere. Prompt and friendly service. Outdoor seating with this weather is perfect."}
{"text":"The place is HUGE inside!!!  The food was really good... the firecracker shrimp were my favorite for the night... only downfall, the service was just a little slow!"}
{"text":"Operated by racists.  Don't eat here while black.  Better yet don't go here at all."}
{"text":"I'm a Caribbean girl that cannot get enough of sweet Bahama Breeze. I always make an extra effort, to dine in here when I visit Vegas. Another 5 Star visit on a warm Saturday night. I made a reservation a couple days ahead, for myself and a few of my girlfriends. I was just a little disappointed that they didn't have the Reggae band playing. 

Overall the service was outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive & efficient. 
Now to the delicious food.
Here's what we opted for:
Taste of Jamaica - 
Awesome jerk pork, jerk chicken, beef empanada, callaloo, sweet plantains, white rice and black beans. Respek the flavor. Love, loved it. 
My very favorite is the Lobster & Shrimp quesadillas. This is a must try. There's no other like it. Two thumbs up!
Caribbean style lobster Mac&Cheese - 
Lightly fried lobster tail with Bahamian mac & cheese. AMAZING! 

Drinks
Goombay Smash - very strong but good. 
Yaka Hula - Bacardi Black Rum, pineapple juice for a tropical tribute to Island romance. This sweet cocktail was inspired by a Hawaiian love song. Excellent drink. One of my favorites.
Pineapple Coconut martini- This is one Sexy drink. Loved it.

My fellow yelpers, I would not steer you wrong, if you're tired of buffet food, fancy expensive hotel dining, come to Bahama Breeze. Prices are very reasonable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I will always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Although I've only been to Bahama Breeze in Las Vegas once, I've been plenty of times in Jacksonville Florida when I used to live there, even celebrated my birthday there. So I think due time for a review.

This restaurant is actually one of my favorite places to dine; it's not \"fine\" dining, but it's not cheap casual. It's a nice in between kinda place, affordable but definitely appropriate for special occasions 

They have awesome fruity speciality drinks but also a full bar so your dark liquors as well and standard type drinks. They have HH from 9pm-close Sunday thru Thursday which is great for Vegas! Love reserve HH!! And their HH includes food items as well. 

This BB is way bigger here in Vegas than the one in Jacksonville. Bigger restaurant means bigger decor and displays inside. Pretty standard dim lighting and Caribbean decor. We came on a Friday and surprisingly it was not busy at all. They had a small dj at the outside patio playing hip hop music that did not seem to fit the theme for the restaurant but the inside music was more fitting and appropriate to the island theme. 

They have a wide variety menu all incorporating an island type theme and taste, but I love how their menu is separated and really makes selection an easy task. 

I'm a sucker for their establishment favorite the Coconut Shrimp. I think I get it every time as an appetizer! The crispy coconut batter on the butterfly shrimps are fried to perfection and that citrus mustard dipping sauce is almost like a marmalade glaze. Not too sweet tho and that mustard almost like a Dijon flavor gives it a nice kick! Definitely one of my fav dishes here. 

My family was having seafood this night (we refrain from meat on Fridays during Lent) and this place has lots of seafood options, well lots of options period. We had the Key West Shrimp and Grits, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the Fish Tacos, and the Island Hopper (it comes with jerk chicken but we just saved it to bring home). 

The shrimp and grits was good, but I wish there was more grits that came with the dish. But the garlic light cream sauce on the shrimp was good and not too heavy, just right. The green beans at accompanied the dish were good, just needed a dab on pepper. 

The calypso shrimp linguine was the best tasting of the 4 main dishes we ordered. My sisters dish so I can only comment on that I tried a little bit of it, but it was enough and tasted good enough that when I go back I want that to be my order!! It's like a light pink sorta sauce, white cream sauce but with the Caribbean flavors and spices it turns it sorta pink ish. Every good and sauce was not too heavy at all. 

My dad had fish tacos accompanied by fries and guacamole. The guc was really good but the tacos shells were a bit too hard. 

The island hopper actually is listed as an appetizer, but mom got it as a main entreè.  Comes with coconut shrimp, coconut batter covered onion rings, shrimp stuffed hush puppies and jerk chicken. The onion rings were good and the coconut batter adds a nice twist of flavor. The hush puppies also very good. I like that they were not too dense, and nice a light almost fluffy. The dish also comes with the citrus mustard and a pineapple chutney - which also tasted like a sweet with a kick pineapple marmalade or glaze!! You can eat the chutney straight, it's so yummy. 

Also the bathrooms are big and nice and I like how the have little mouthwash cups and mouthwash available at the sink so if you're going out straight after dinner, that least you good on the breath check 

The place is a chain restaurant, so you get what you expect, but it's great food, reasonable pricing, appropriate for special occasions but not going to blow your wallet like if you were to eat somewhere on strip in Las Vegas and probably get less quantity. It's a good vibes sorta place and the service is good!! S/O to our server Matt for taking good care of us!! 

Solid good dining restaurant and I will be back! Yay"}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant. The jerk chicken was as close to authentic as you can get. The empanadas were delicious as well. Fun environment. Cute setting. Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give this a better review.   

Went here while in town, and because my boss was staying at the hotel next to it and was curious to what it was. 

There was an NBA playoff game that night, so we went in with the hopes of sitting at the bar and watching the game.   Not that every restaurant needs to have tv's, but hey, if you have them....  great.

We sat at the bar, and the game was on, the smallest TV i have ever seen at a bar.  It was about the size of the security monitors some place off on their park ling lots.  So, needless to say, we could see little, tiny guys running around but never could see the score.  

The server was super friendly, but they were super inattentive.  Our food was just ok, nothing to write home about.   I guess we were pushing closing time, because they started mopping behind the bar with that smelly mop water while we were still eating.    Then we had to wait -- the longest wait-- was trying to get our check and pay to be able to leave. 

Not sure if I'd come here again. Unremarkable.  Not what I remember from my youth.."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Saturday night.  Easy to get a table and the service was perfect, never felt rushed and never waited for a refill or a dirty plate to be taken away.  Food was delicious and the margarita was the best I have had in quite awhile."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing and at the same time hard to believe this place has a rating as high as 3.5 stars. After eating here I have to believe nobody involved with this restaurant has ever eaten Caribbean food. Myself having spent 3 years living in South Florida, eating at small, authentic, family owned restaurants (and eating authentic homemade Carribbean food) I have to say there was nothing remotely authentic with the food I received. I could go on but I won't, just save your money and your stomach and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Loved the experience of dining here! 

Food: We ordered a variety of dishes, including the nachos without beef, chicken quesadilla, and my personal favorite - the jackfruit tacos. Personally I found the chicken quesadilla a bit dry. However, the jackfruit tacos were mind blowing and very unique. They came with a side dish, so we chose the black bean soup which was better than most I've tasted elsewhere. Their drinks menu was also really impressive - I want to come back here to try the margarita flight, which includes a hibiscus margarita and tamarind margarita. 

Service: Our server was Earl, and he was very attentive, polite, and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised with the service we received, even during peak weekend hours."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I thought it was amazing. The second time not so much, it could be due to the fact that my mom was vomiting in her napkin(alcoholic) and it just killed it. It just didn't seem to deliver like i remembered. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places to eat in vegas.. I have eaten here dozens of times.  They have amazing drinks, and their food is like none other.  Unique, flavorful and just WOW. We have eaten at various times of day, and have always had A+ service and food. You MUST go there.. Love their Bahama Magarite with a sweet shot on the side.  The bread pudding was so good and love their specials.."}
{"text":"I always get the Caribbean jerk chicken pasta.  I love it ! YUM"}
{"text":"This past weekend we tried to attend a birthday party down the street at Paladar but due to poor management there, we found ourselves not receiving service or locating an empty seat so we headed down the street to Bahama Breeze.  The manager quickly welcomed our group of nearly 20 with open arms and fast service for drinks, appetizers and desserts.  He was a big part of the reason that our night was salvaged.  Thanks so much, guys!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and drink .Been there a few time and never had a bad experience bar tenders and waiters are very friendly.and the drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great and not very expensive, atmosphere was very nice. The only downside was the drinks were a little pricey which considering its Vegas, probably very common. We came on a Friday night at 630pm and had no wait. Definitely worth coming"}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour in Las Vegas. Half off appetizers and $4 cocktails. The Ultimate Pina Coloda is my fave its so refreshing. The jerk chicken wings are a must try."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food here but today's experience is not good.  My group has now been here for two hours and we still don't have our food.  We have a group of 11.  When we got here the restaurant was only about 1/2 full but we were told that it was a 45 minute wait.  They seated us after about 40 minutes but now on over an hour later we still don't have our food and the natives are getting restless."}
{"text":"If you wanna feel like you're on vacation come here! Tropical drinks, amazing food, & atmosphere that makes you think you're eating on an island. I'd recommend to everyone! This place is huge & the layout is awesome. Also good service."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?! We got a tip while around town that if you want to try an amazing pina colada, go to Bahama Breeze. We went over obviously with high expectations and we were not let down whatsoever. 

I would like to mention that the service here is phenomenal. Our waitress, Tina, was probably one of the nicest waitresses I have had in along time. She was personable, she would talk and joke with us and just super nice. I have no complaints about service at all. 

The atmosphere in this place is pretty rad as well. There was live music, a little covered deck with a fire pit, and a lot of cool decorations that made for a great environment. This place is mainly a seafood restaurant, so if that's not your thing then this place probably isn't for you. I'm a huge seafood fan so I loved it. 

Last of all, the sought after pina colada that we were searching town for were hands down the best I've ever had! There was more to it than just your average pina colada, it was called the \"ultimate pina colada\" for a reason. Me and my girlfriend both were very impressed with it. We weren't too hungry so we just got some street tacos to shared and they were great as well.

We sat and hung out at this place and just talked for a while because it was such a great environment to just relax and have a great time. 
If you're in Vegas,  GO TO THE BAHAMA BREEZE! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the food was good. My wife and I had the center cut steak   Medium well) with mashed potatoes and green beans. My steak was cooked great but my wife's steak was cooked medium. The staff was great and re-cooked it just right and quickly, though both could of used more flavor. We had jerk chicken for an appetizer that was pretty good and filling. Overall a good dinner out."}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken pasta and fresh lemonade!!! That's a must have with any meal. Food is always good and customer service is great! Always a nice treat for the family, especially when you have small kids since it's kid friendly. Always nice to have dinner in the outdoor patio area. Oh and make sure you attend happy hour!!!! Yummy!!!! Definitely a favorite spot."}
{"text":"We decided to avoid the craziness of the strip & come here for dinner last night, thinking it would be less busy. It was a lot less busy but very understaffed. We had to wait almost 40 min for a table for 4 at an almost empty restaurant. We were seated at around 10:30 pm. 

To be fair - the food was not bad. What was most upsetting is that I ordered the rice bowl with shrimp & fish. A few bites in, I bit into something hard. I thought it was a fish bone but it was a sharp jagged piece of a plastic - probably the remnants of a food container about an inch long and wide. I told the server & she asked if I wanted my dish replaced and I said no as I did not want to wait for another plate at that time of night as our kids were very tired. She showed the plastic object to her manager & I was waiting to see what he/she would say or do. Well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing. No apology from the manager & we got charged for my dish. Very disappointing.  

This is not the first time we have found unwelcome objects in our food at restaurants. In fact once at BJ's my sons Mac & Cheese had the corner of a plastic bag in it but we did not say anything as it was large enough to see & not harmful. The sever saw it as she collected the plates & reported it to the manager. She came to our table to apologize & said we would not be charged for the dish. 

So to the manager of the Bahama Breeze - your management skills need some fine tuning to say the least. Your food quality control obviously needs some work. It's not OK to find sharp plastic objects in our food & it's especially not OK for you to ignore it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It almost felt like I wasn't in the chain-ey burbs of Pittsburgh when I sat on the deck! 

Definitely a new stable in my restaurant routine.  

Pros: Fresh Fish, summery drink list, outdoor seating 

Cons: Cheesy uniforms 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"The extra star is for our excellent service-
To be honest the food was \"alright\". 
Alexis was very personable and informative. I was so pleased to have observed her equally attentive and welcoming service to all customers. My husband and I often go out and its rare and rewarding to get great service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great layout, music, etc; relaxing atmosphere. 

I was in Vegas for a work convention (exciting, I know) and on the way to the airport, for the last couple of hours, I wanted something quick and easy... but relaxing.  My local friends wanted to meet here for Happy Hour.  

I got here around 4:30 on a Monday.  I really love being able to just park and walk up in Vegas. Eating on the strip is a whole process of parking and walking through casinos... that's like a wasted 20 minutes there, another 20 back.  A place like this, nice and easy.  

The layout is great.  It goes for a Caribbean/Cuban feel, especially outside, without feeling cheesy.  Nice shutters on the enclosed patio area, warm air coming in, sunny... just a very relaxed atmosphere where you really don't feel like you're in Vegas.  I felt like I was on vacation, actually, which sounds cheesy but it's true.  The restaurant was pretty open, though, but it was a weekday.  

Now, the food...

Happy Hour is an amazing deal.  It's like $5-something per dish and beers and drinks are from $2-$3....!?  What... the... hell!  So good.   

We were starving so we got almost one of everything; the jerk chicken, pork sliders, burger sliders, empandas, quesadilla, coconut shrimp, etc.  Everything was great.  My friends were a little hesitant about the jerk chicken because it was black, due to the rub, but it was great.   My friends had a pineapple coconut martini (great), mojito (they loved it, had real sugar cane), I had a hefeweizen.   

So basically, you can't miss at Happy Hour - everything was great.

This is a small detail that I really appreciate. In the men's bathroom, they have mouthwash dispensers. It's a great touch because, let's be honest, your breath after eating isn't going to be the best so this is a great way to hit the reset button. 

It was just a fun, casual experience... it really felt like we weren't in Vegas, but on vacation."}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp and Mahi, vegetables,sweet peas and yellow rice- combined in one perfect mix, just the right Jamaican spices! Delicious mojitos and exotic island drinks make for a perfect touch with sesame crusted Ahi tuna!! the Jerk chicken is scrumptious.  The Lobster and shrimp quesadilla should not be missed- enjoy the island music, the superb service and the island ambience!! Special thank you to Brandon and Dan for making our dinner extra special. Happy hour is great and the fire pit always adds to the perfect island setting."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for lunch and it was pretty good. Had the sirloin and it was fine. Had the ultimate pineapple drink and it was on point. Service was good and restaurant seemed to have a pretty laid back atmosphere. All the food we ordered was pretty good, would recommend to others and go back."}
{"text":"Great place. We've been here before. As we arrived and were seated we spent about 5 minutes without a greeting or drinks. I was a little upset but the manager took notice and made everything great. She took care of us immediately. Offered 2 appetizers on the house and turned us over to a great server. The rest of the meal was perfect. The Mahi Mahi was cooked as it should. Environment is lively and inviting. Great dinner. Thank you"}
{"text":"#JerkWings..#HappyHour..Great food and service was on point as well..Must stop by if you are staying in the area."}
{"text":"Happy hours prices are VERY good, but sit at the bar.  I don't know if my waiter was new or what but service was very slow.  Never came by to check if we needed more drinks.  Only stayed for one round and appetizers.  Food was pretty bland but cheap.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain, this is your spot especially during happy hour!! My friend took me here since we both were craving for refreshing piña coladas. Happy hour deals are great. We came in at 5 and the restaurant wasn't so busy so we got seated right away. Our waitress took our orders and was very enthusiastic. The only thing was that she didn't commit to her promises. When she asked if we wanted lemon with our water, she did not provide the lemon. And many times she visited our table of empty cups, she did not quickly respond to refill them. Other than that, food and drinks were bomb and I also really like the set up of the restaurant. It's nicely jungle/exotic themed and they also offer patio seating for lovely fresh air! Will be back for more"}
{"text":"This place is a total joke. Our server was an absolute jerk who refused to give us menus because we sat down in the bar table area without getting menus from the dimwitted hostess. Then he went off on a tangent about how there was a miscommunication and we should not have been seated without menus. He is the definition of a low wage uneducated worker. So then i go to the bar and tell the bartender i want two drinks for me and my date (who looked better in her photos ) and he says he will let our server know because im in his section. I go off on the dude because i just want to get two drinks and carry them the 2 feet from the bar to the table right behind me, but he refused to do this cause it wasn't fair to the server. What a bunch of degenerates at this chain hell. The manager came over and eventually offered to buy me 2 drinks, but hell no because he defended his erver. Ended up walking out on my ugly date, who was sitting at the table wondering what the hell she should do and also this Bahama Breeze forever. Letter to corporate also sent, but a canned response was received. Punks."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on 8.12.15 and had a great experience. Our server Tina and her team were very attentive and the food was delicious. Happy hour is good because you don't have to be just in the bar to take advantage of the reduced rate. We have been here several times when visiting Vegas, I wish the restaurant was close to home in California."}
{"text":"We came into here, while in Vegas, off of the YELP reviews!  The inside is very cute and tropical. I had a frozen specialty drink and it was delicious.  My husband got ice tea and it was horrible.  So, they brought a fresh brewed glass of tea, and it tasted bad too!   It tasted like old coffee.  We thought maybe they brew the coffee and tea in the same pitcher. But he assured us that doesn't happen.  We left and did not order food. We figured if they can't do something as simple as tea, that there could be more disappointments!"}
{"text":"This is now the 3rd time we have been here and they have again failed to disappointment. First of, our waitress was wonderful. Her name is Tina. She was wonderful and friendly. She took her time to explain each item to us. When we did not like a particular drink, she immediately changed it for us. What wonderful service!"}
{"text":"We have been to Bahama Breeze twice so far. I would have to say their seafood is way better than their steaks. The drinks are reasonably priced and the staff are always friendly. Going there reminds me of visiting the bahamas.  Overall, we really enjoy this place and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Ugh, so many people that I know like this place, but I don't get it!  I've been here a handful of times because it is right around the corner from my office.

Located on the corner of Flamingo & Paradise, there is indoor and outdoor seating and a decent amount of parking.

I came here last week for lunch with 5 of my co-workers.  They ask where we would like to sit.  We asked if we could sit in the \"patio\" area; its this big round room and the windows can open when it's nice outside.  So they take us to the table; there are only 3 seats.  We look at the guy that brought us to our table and we say \"this table is a little too small, there are 5 of us\" and he says \"yes, I know.  I have no idea why they brought you out here.  Unfortunately, there isn't any tables out here big enough for your group.\"  We tell him no problem and sit us wherever there is room.

He takes us back inside to the room behind the bar and sits us at a table that is set for 4 people, but enough room for 5.

We ordered a handful of appetizers and each of us ordered entrees.  I ordered the combination chicken & veggie quesadilla and a caesar salad.  The caesar was barely dressed and wasn't that good anyways.  Now, I've had the lobster quesadilla here before and it was gross.  So I thought chicken and fresh vegetables couldn't be that bad.  Well, it's not good.  I don't know how to put it.  But the flavor sucks.

We get a discount to eat here because of where our office is located and I would STILL never come here again."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party! Kristine B And Kurt did an amazing service! The food was great. I ordered a burger and fries and it was so good. My boyfriend had a pasta that was just as good.
Nice atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"First time here around 1 pm on a saturday. When we walked in we were told a 15 min wait although there were a ton of empty tables. When I asked why the wait the hostess said each server could only have 3 tables. Maybe management should learn how to staff. The food sounds great on paper but none had any flavor it was very bland. The service was ok I wouldn't rush to eat here"}
{"text":"Came here on valentines day. :) I loved it. Great food and decent drinks. Spinach dip could have been a little better, but everything else was to die for."}
{"text":"Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no
EVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses"}
{"text":"Had a business mixer here and loved the staff and atmosphere. The waitress always made sure I had a drink and never went without. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food tastes like a cross between something out of a can, low end buffet food, and frozen mass produced microwaved dish components. 

I had the grilled chicken with cilantro sauce. It was slop. Nothing tasted fresh. The sauces were definitely from a gallon can or barrel. 

I've had a salad here my previous time which was edible but not great, hence the 2 stars and not 1star. 

Also, prices are very cheap for the area, and many office workers from walking distance go since there is a discount for Howard Hughes buildings employees. 

For the money I'd rather drive or walk a few blocks more and get something I'm going to enjoy."}
{"text":"I've never tried Caribbean inspired food before so when my friend took us here, I was in for a pleasant surprise. Upon entering the restaurant, I loved the décor and the ambiance in general. They had live music the night that we went, which added to our wonderful experience here. Our waitress was such a sweet heart and she gave us some very good meal suggestions. The food was delicious! I highly recommend, especially if you've never had any Caribbean style food before."}
{"text":"My co workers and I went here for lunch today during work.  We sat outside which I loved. Granted, today was extremely warm for November. It was 75 today but they have heaters outside just in case it is chilly and you wanna enjoy the meal outside.

Our waiter kita, was very pleasant and fast. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and super friendly. 

I order shrimp and lobster quesadilla with the seafood chowder. The quesadilla was ok, there was not a lot in them so I won't order that again, but the soup was perfection. It was enough food that was I wasn't super hungry after. I definitely had room for dessert but we didn't have much time.

The lunch combo was reasonably priced around 10 dollars but there was a very vast menu so there are plenty of options"}
{"text":"Awesome place located on paradise awesome drink a must to visit.  The food is very good to, parking is ok."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of hype. No tables available. Hmmmm so I sat at the bar. When the bar staff discovered I wasn't drinking alcohol it became cold. There was a female doing odd jobs around the bar with a crazy overdone laugh. Looked like a horror show actress. Had fish... Liked the spice but some bean side was tossed on the plate. It's a chain looks like a chain and taste like a chain."}
{"text":"What is not to love about this place, we usually come in for the happy hour deal, my favorite are ultimate piña colada, shrimp with lobster quesadillas, jumbo lump crab stack, Jamaican chicken wings and sesame crusted ahi, the price is so reasonable and they are very generous with their portion. Theirs waiters and waitresses are always upbeat and happy."}
{"text":"A new favorite!  We were looking for a casual seafood restaurant not on the strip.  Very happy we found Bahama Breeze and will definitely be back.  Our only complaint is there are no BB in Arizona where we live!   I had a salmon tostado. Delicious with lots of greens on the tostado, topped with the salmon.  DH had fish tacos which he liked very much.  It was just before Mothers' Day and I had their special Mothers' Day cocktail. What a trip. They put Cotton Candy (yes) in a martini glass, and dropped some raspberries on it. Then, at our table, they shook together rum and fruit flavored liquors and poured them over the cotton candy (which melted)  It was very sweet and really fun to have.  Service was very helpful and friendly and time waiting for food was fine."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service.  We had the grilled Mahi Mahi with mash potatoes. Also I ordered the lemongrass shrimp and Mahi Mahi, it was a big portion. I recommend the half size portion of your not very hungry. The Night Shift Manager MoMe is the BEST. Also the bartender Jason is also one of the best."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!

The atmosphere, food & staff have been great so far!

We came here for my daughters birthday dinner & she loved the atmosphere. She loves water fountains & water falls so she loved seeing a wishing fall right when you enter. 

Our food was amazing, I ordered the Stuffed Plantain and it was so good. All of their plates are pretty large, great for sharing or just taking the rest home. Our kiddos ordered the kids Mac n' Cheese and it was pretty good, they ate it all. Once again the plates are pretty big so our kiddos shared that plate and it was more than enough for them. My husband ordered the Skirt Steak Churrasco & enjoyed it, he as well ordered a Coconut Mojito which was fresh with a hint of sweetness. I ordered their Mango Lemonade for myself and the kiddos and we loved it. A little on the sweeter side but it comes chilled so it tastes good, I'm not big on sweet drinks but this was pretty good. 

We plan on going back for sure."}
{"text":"Just perfect after a cross country flight.  Chicken scirache sandwich and a stone ipa it doesn't get any better.  Fish taco and a top shelf margarita, again perfect.  All for 40 bucks, pretty good for Vegas."}
{"text":"Best service! My sister and her husband had her wedding here! Food was great and they even gave extra! Drinks are excellent too! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous. I had the jerk chicken pasta and it was great. My husband had the beef bowl and he was beyond pleased. The key lime pie was amazing. Great family atmosphere. The children's menu was healthy and delicious. We had dinner there 2 nights in a row because it was soooo good. Both nights our waitresses were wonderful. Tina and Marge were wonderful, welcoming people. Can't wait to go back. I'm sorry you don't have a location in California. Thanks again"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant a couple of times and there food is pretty good overall. I like the theme of the place...makes me feel like I'm on a tropical island. I absolutely love their bathrooms...I feel bathrooms say a lot about a restaurant. They were very clean, nicely decorated, full size doors for every stall, big size stalls, and they have mouth wash with individual cups so you can be minty fresh as you leave.

The food:

Lobster and Shrimp Quesadilla- It was good but I imagined something different so it was tasty but I felt it was missing a bit more flavor. Glad I tried it but I'll probably go with something else next time.

Seafood Chowder- That was delicious, had a good amount of shrimp and vegetables and was creamy, I loved it.

Cobb Salad- It was big and came with the usual fixings but I've had better cobb's in my life. 

Coconut Shrimp- Mmm...mmm...mmm...a must if you eat at this restaurant. Perfectly fried and packed with flavor.

Chocolate Pineapple Cake- I don't like chocolate but I do love pineapple and this dessert called to me. It was warm, rich, and melted in my mouth. I suggest sharing because it's very decadent...I needed a glass of water when I finished. 

They have a large menu so there's something for everyone and they have a good selection of tropical alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the curry chicken, drinks were stiff, food was great, and the waiter drew on my to go box with a date. I liked that, in case you have your food in the fridge, you know the date you put it there. The downfall, I asked for more water and she forgot. Always busy. I guess that's a plus, unless you want more water."}
{"text":"It used to be better.  But I still enjoy going there once in awhile."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Bahama Breeze in Las Vegas.  The food and service were great.   The prices were very reasonable.   The Shrimp Tacos were awesome. Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Erica helped us..she's awesome.  We'll be asking for the next time. 

The food was great also. The only complaint that I have... They run out of the food I wanted."}
{"text":"The food here is great...I loved almost everything we ordered.  Especially good was the jerk Jamaican chicken...annoying to eat the wings but the spices made it worth the bother.  Their seafood Paella is very yummy.  Drinks are pretty strong...especially the mojito.  If you want something sweeter, try their coconut pineapple martini.  For appetizers, I liked the coconut shrimp, calamari, and spinach artichoke dip.

Their bathrooms are really nice too.  They have nice smelling lotion and mouthwash.  Service is pretty good.  There is a large patio which is very convenient if you have a big party."}
{"text":"The food was about an 8 out of 10 to me. The bar server that served us was not attentive at all (and she was not busy. Lot of times just talking to co-workers..with her back to us the majority of the time). Therefore, her tip was very minimal."}
{"text":"Take a trip to the Carribean and enjoy coconut shrimp with a Bahama Mama drink; clean atmosphere, friendly staff, relax with Reggae sounds and marimba music. The menu is simple and reasonably priced. Sit outside and chill and meet new people."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The place is huge though and the noise a bit to loud for my taste.

We were quickly seated and served by Donna, which was such a nice girl! Very observant all the way!

Had a mojito which was delicious - not many people can make a great mojito, I think.

Had the shrimp linguine which was delicious too.

My dad had the lobster linguine which I tasted and it sadly enough did not taste of that much.

Ended the meal with a dulce de leche cheese cake which was soooo delicious and so sinful to eat as it contains about 900cal according to the menu card. 

I also had a margarita with my dulce de leche cake, which I will not recommend unless you really like tequila as it is really dominating in the drink. 

I am sad that the place was so big and loud as the food and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped by this place and we checked the reviews on Yelp and we came for lunch. We definitely enjoyed this place. It is a mixed of Caribbean food. Really good. In addition my wife order a pinacolada. She loved it. It has a little splash of run. If you don't like too much alcohol this is for you otherwise you can order something different. I ordered a margarita mango. This one, I really don't recommend it. Not a good taste. I couldn't found the taste of the mango. It was more alcohol than anything else. Next time I may tried something else. Very affordable and great food."}
{"text":"A little Caribbean in the desert. This is one of my favorite restaurants since I moved to Vegas. The restaurant has a relaxing feel and good music. They have a great selection of tropical drinks. I love the food and have probably ordered everything on the menu. My last visit I had the smothered pork chop lunch special and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"My local friends picked this restaurant for a get together/dinner after not having seen each other for many years.  While the restaurant got busy, they did not mind we stayed at our table talking and drinking for hours.  We shared the Jamaican jerk wings, quesadilla, and empanadas,  All were winners -- and on happy hour sale pricing!  We opted for salads and my Cobb was delicious, large, crisp, fresh and tasty!  Beer COLD on a very hot day and our waiter, Marshall, was top notch, attentive, and friendly!  Top marks for a relaxing, fun evening meal."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here! Every time everyone is so sweet and attentive. Not to mention the atmosphere- such a great get away from the suburbs I truly feel like I'm in the Florida keys when I am inside this restaurant. I usually get the \"coconut shrimp\" BUT I substitute it to be firecracker.... they offer the firecracker as the appetizer but let me switch it out to have a full \"meal\"'with bigger portions and with the sides as well. That's one thing I really want to stress... this restaurant is happy to make simple accommodations that other restaurants may be agitated to do. 

Great drinks, appetizers, and entrees. The sizes are good and the prices are pretty average considering the location, portions, and type of food of course. I would compare this to a more tropical Red Lobster if you will. Defiantly give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  This was our first stop (AFTER HOTEL) to eat and drink.  The food was pretty good.  My husband was impressed by the jerk chicken.  We devoured our food!!!!!  The drinks were good and CHEAP.  The staff helped our group of 25 people (many of them under 25) without issue."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Bahama breeze I remembered in Orlando.  Food was great as was the cocktails!  We got in during happy hour which meant $5 cocktails and 1/2 priced appetizers.  Their Pina cola da is  an island twist off the norm with strawberry swirled throughout, so yummy.  Their habanero wings were great with a sweet and spicy sauce which only left a slight tingle on the tongue but still packed with flavor.  We also enjoyed the jerk shrimp appetizer which was shrimp scampi bathing in a pond of buttery broth with very subtle jerk seasoning, not overpowering like I had anticipated, and served with a French bread loaf for soaking up the flavorful broth.  My entree was their special: A lobster, shrimp, and mussel bowl with baby potatoes and butternut squash, swimming in a tomato herb soup also served with French bread for dipping.  Slightly different seasoning compared to the Italian or cuban versions I've had before, with similar seasoning as their jerk shrimp, but not overpowering.  Overall the food was great and the service started out good, but at the end we sat waiting for our server and bill, so a little let down there, but otherwise a real treat!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food  awsome selection of cocktails.  Daniel is an awsome server"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great for a great price. I would not recommend sitting in the outside \"covered\" area because it has poor ventilation and it always hot and muggy. Other than that, great"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!  Honestly wasn't expecting much, but my chicken tortilla soup was really good.  Very flavourful and featuring a lovely broth.  My server, Victor, was delightfully snarky whilst demonstrating waiterly competence.  My lunch companions were equally happy with their meals and we all wished we could stay longer to enjoy the island ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go here with his parents for the holidays or special occassions. His Grandma always sends a gift card to this restaurant. I'm guessing it's one of her favorites. On this occassion I had the ahi salad appetizer and an iced tea. 

I saw ahi on the menu and I knew I had to have it. I've been on a real tuna kick lately and the menu pic looked divine. When I received my plate... after a very long wait it looked exactly like the menu. It was stunning. 

Sadly it didn't taste like they seared the tuna in sesame oil, so there wasn't a ton of flavor. Also it was an appetizer and not an entree. I knew this going in, but there was no entree sized ahi, and I wanted ahi bad. I ate it and I was still hungry. I resorted to stealing french fries off my husband's plate when he wasn't looking. 

The decor was beautiful and there is even a fun little waterfall and river running through the restraunt. I had lots of time to walk around and snap photos because the service was exceptionally slow. The iced tea tasted fresh brewed and was quite good. Despite slow service, my glass was usually full so I was grateful for that. 

So the bottom line... It was ok. I will be back. I wish they had a full size ahi salad, and I wish they used sesame oil to sear and maybe a touch of wasabi on the side just for fun. I've had better tasting dishes here that were more filling, so maybe next time I'll grab the entree portion of the shrimp instead."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went on a double date here tonight. We have never been to this restaurant before but heard their late night happy hour was nice. We got there just after 9 and it was fairly empty. I requested to sit outside because it was 80 outside but felt nice. We were seated in the \"outside\" with an AC unit blasting on us. I get cool easily so I wasn't loving it. We ordered 2 Pina Coladas, nachos, a burger and side Salad.  The drinks were good, good flavor but took a while to come. The food was out so quickly it was amazing. The burger was decent, as my fiance said it's hard to mess up a burger. The ceaser salad was, meh, limp lettuce and way to much dressing. The nachos were disappointing. Not enough chip to topping ratio, the salsa was a little bit meh too. Overall we didn't spend much because of the happy hour and we left full. We decided we wouldn't be back unless it was just for drinks because the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum...

The lobster mac is EVERYTHING.  The drinks were measured and everyone knows thats not my thing...but still worth it.  The bartender told me that happy hour started again from 9pm to 12 am, so as a visitor I really appreciated the great service.

I also met a great new friend here...so what more can I ask for!

4 stars because it feels like a chain and again drinks are measured."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife and my 8 year-old. Menu is pretty big and have something for everyone, including a good size kids menu. Server was very accommodating as well with couple special requests and last minute change by my wife and I. Cilantro chicken was very good, so was their chowder (very filling), my son liked their burger and fries, nice touch with some fruit on the side. He also got a kick out of individual playing carriers drums. Good experience but does feel like  chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We're always looking for a good happy hour and Bahama Breeze has a pretty good one.  Lots of drink specials and lots of food specials.  The drinks are good but the food and service is just so so.  It's a good place to go when you just want something quick but there are plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, the service, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for anyone. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"That chicken tortilla soup is absolutely delicious.  Could be I am a sucker for fresh chunks of avocado.  No, the soup would have even been delicious without it.

The rest of the meal was fine, and filling.  The drinks were reasonably priced.  The restaurant itself is nice... pretty decor.  Nice amenities in the ladies' room, I love the scope with little disposable cups.  Our server did his job adequately.

Overall, nothing to complain about, but nothing outstanding aside from that yummy soup."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain, but since this is the only one I've ever been to, it's new to me.  The waiters were good, and the menu very interesting.  What sticks out is the goat cheese appetizer that is served in the roasted red pepper terrines.  Now, don't be like a lot of people and not eat the pepper terrine, they are fantastic.  Seriously, the best thing on the menu that I have tried.

I think this would be a great place for a happy hour, assuming your work lies anywhere near this remote location on I-271."}
{"text":"In general I'm not a fan of chains but this place does it right and I've had some fun times here.  They make some really nice drinks and the food is decent.  Some of the food items aren't all that great with a few being grossly bland while others approach greatness.  The drinks generally outshine the food and are among the prettiest and most colorful concoctions I've ever seen while often being a bit too weak on the booze for my palette.  This is a pretty large restaurant that always seems to have a crowd and I really prefer sitting at the bar to be closer to the action so I don't get lost in the horde of other customers.  This isn't a place I would hang out all the time but it certainly can be fun on occasion for a little imaginary tropical flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's a convenient place for lunch.  I think what this place does well is drinks, desserts, and service.  The mojitos tend to be a little sweet for me but they get the job done.  The banana bread dessert was amazing the last time I had it, as was the pineapple upside down cake.  And the servers have always been fun and friendly.  Oh, and free wi-fi.  Gotta love that!

The entrees need some work though.  They all tend to be really greasy.  I did not see one pasta without cream sauce, except on the kids menu.  You can make some ok food here if you are creative, but it'll take you about 5 minutes to order with all the special requests.  My favorite is probably the chicken kabob with steamed broccoli instead of rice.  Yes, even the rice was too greasy for me.  But the servers have always been willing to put in special requests and get the meal just the way I want it.  The problem is that it has taken a lot of experimentation to get there.  They used to have a lemongrass chicken sandwich that was decent but they took it off the menu. Oh well, I can always just stick to a liquid diet.  :)"}
{"text":"I just don't get what people see in this place. I guess the food is just bland enough to appeal to the masses, and it's just cheesy enough to be \"fun\" (read Tchotchke's in Office Space). From the music, to the decor, to the food, this place is just packed with epic fail. I wanted to shoe the bargain basement Jimmy Buffet square in the nuts, not that I enjoy the real one by any stretch of the imagination.

We had the calamari appetizer, thinking it was a safe bet, and it was astonishingly rubbery. I mean, there's rubbery calamari, then there's this; it's like the difference between vulcanized rubber and the stuff they use in rubber bands. I ordered the seafood paella, and the waiter remarked that it was his favorite dish and it was just fantastic. The guy's nuts. There couldn't have been more wrong with it, save for the fish showing up raw (it was overcooked instead). Absolutely no flavor. They must not put any salt in the pot when they cook the rice, because I don't think there's any other way to make rice this unexciting. I suspect the origin of its yellow-orange hue didn't come from saffron, either. Don't remember what my fiance ordered, and neither does she, but we both remember it sucked. Bland, unexciting, chain-wide recipes aside, this kitchen had some serious issues seasoning their food properly.

All that, a beer, and a margarita for $53. What a gyp."}
{"text":"Service 5/5
Food 4/5
Cleanliness 5/5
Decor 5/5

Came here today and was pretty impressed by the waiter and the wide selection from their menu.  My favorites are the bahamarita, conch fritters, and lobster Shrimp quesadilla. Definitely a repeat!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas I love eating off of the strip. Just to get away from all the chaos of the strip.  Walking into this place not only are you away from the strip, but its like walking onto a small island. And u can smell the great aromas as soon as you walk in the door. Now i;m not a big fan of spicy food, but I enjoy some good flavor. Those jamaican jerk chicken wings are phenominal. Its the right amount of heat with the the best amount of absolute great flavor. They were amazingly good. The chicken tortilla soup was just as good. I can't wait to go back and try something else when I have a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"Every time I try and explain the inside of Bahama Breeze, people make fun of me. Usually because I start off by saying it's as if I'm on a Caribbean cruise. In all seriousness, I felt as though I was eating on a cruise ship overlooking the ocean. It was a different and awesome experience.

Both the food and service were great! I received a coupon in the mail and decided to take a chance. My waitress was very friendly and knew her stuff. I told her what kind of things I liked and she was able to recommend the Seafood Paella (assorted seafood, chicken, sausage and peas with yellow rice). Usually the first bite tells you how the rest of the meal will go. Immediately, I could tell how fresh my dish was and because of that, it made the meal even more amazing. Although Bahama Breeze was a bit pricey, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and very friendly people. The jeeked chicken was perfect. Great rum drinks. I wish we had a BAHAMA breeze in our area, upstate NY."}
{"text":"We had Isha as our server and she was awesome! Great customer service and awesome food! I would definitely recommend this place ecsepcially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"TOO BAD IT'S CLOSED!  Best Lemonade Around!  I weep for their fresh squeezed lemonade made with sugar cane syrup with sugar cane sticks to chew on.  (And they would bring you a 'side shaker' full of extra - like when you get a really good milkshake at a soda fountain!)  I used to love the Cuban sandwich, even though it made you feel like you needed a nap afterwards!  Why they got rid of this chain when there is such CRAP around here that should close down is beyond me..."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch today (Thursday) and the service was slow and horrible! Our server (Alejandra)literally dropped off our food and never came back until she dropped off the bill!!  The table next to us had the same issue! 2 Stars because the food and atmosphere was good)"}
{"text":"my first visit to Bahama breeze was for valentines day 2012. someone told my husband about this place so we decided to check it out. we fell in love! we now come here every other month or so (we live an hour away or we would come more frequent). the staff is always amazing! we have never had bad service here. my husband isn't very adventurous so he has had some of the burgers he has since graduated to the rice bowls. I however have tried half the menu! I haven't had anything I didn't love here. our food is always hot and fresh. my favorite however are the yucca fries. my husband loves the coconut onion rings. I have also been to other Bahama breeze restaurants in Florida when I see one I have to stop and eat! We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great atmosphere great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner, onion rings were good but huge so were the conch fritters. Our waiter Brandon was funny and helpful with suggestions. Love Bahamas Breeze!"}
{"text":"Overall, alright. I went here with two of my teammates and their families. We had an order of firecracker shrimp which was pretty good, big portion which was good. I had the pork rice bowl. Again, big portion. I was  underwhelmed with the pork, it was pretty fatty and not very good, everything else in it was good though. Both of my teammates got the ribs and they both really liked theirs. My dad got the jerk chicken which was pretty good too. Our server was nice, a little on the slow side but it seemed like a lot of the staff weren't doing much. Good atmosphere, live steel drum guy and lots of seating so waits can't be that long. If you're into better quality food, head up to wasabi, but if not looking for family friendly or not very pricy, come on down"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today. Service was exceptional. The pasta dish was delicious.
Will definitely be going back. Will probably visit after work for Happy Hour to enjoy the libations."}
{"text":"Let me first say that Bahama Breeze is where we go when we want to treat ourselves to a good dining experience and don't mind paying a bit more for quality.  We even call it the \"vacation restaurant.\" 
 However my visit on Saturday Jan 2, did not live up to our expectations.  It was busy and they were backed up, which was understandable as apparently the entire population of the city decided they needed to shop that day.  But once we were finally seated, the experience did not really improve.  The servers seemed to have no sense of urgency or hustle. Drinks weren't refilled promptly, or at all.  Appetizer was delivered literally 5 seconds before the entrees. I hate that, and mentioned it to the people that brought the food, they just said \"sorry and ran away. My actual server was conspicuously absent for most of the meal after that,  No one followed up,  I could see people stacked up in the waiting area, but for most of the meal there were empty tables around us. So either the servers couldn't handle a full house or the kitchen was fouled up.  Either way, the staff I interacted with did not seem to see or care about the problems I saw.
  Both adults ordered soup, one bowl was delivered before the entree, another was delivered with the entree. No reason was given, apparently that is a decision that is not made by the patron. I had the black bean soup and fish tacos. The tacos seemed bland, like someone forgot the spice. Really, it was just a hunk of whitefish over coleslaw in a tortilla. The black bean soup was mostly broth, with very little beans.  
 So I don't know if they were just having a bad day, or if the place is just not as good as it used to be. Disappointing, really.  Wasted someone's holiday gift card that wouldn't normally be able to afford to go there on there own income. That's what really makes me mad."}
{"text":"Ambience is okay. Dim lighting. Big space. Big parking. Wooden tables with a slimy touch. Cocktails were unimpressive. Mojito was sweet and not refreshing. Pomegranate Cosmopolitan was ok.
Chicken empadas were average. Hardly any chicken.
The fire.. shrimp was good.
West indies chicken curry was not good.
Crab stack was good. It's cold cocktail dish. 
Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"I had dinner at a Bahama Breeze years ago in Orlando Florida- great experience and good food.  So while visiting LV, I learned there was a location there and had to go! HUGE mistake! It started with a very nice waitress who came to my table... it started like this,
 
'Today's specials are A, B, C, and D. We are out of A and B, and if you want C, we no longer have chorizo that goes in it but we can substitute it for something else.'

Um what??! 

So we asked her for her suggestions and her 'most recommended' items were the Lobster Linguine and the Key West Shrimp and Grits. My husband and I ordered both dishes. Disgusting. You know what this reminded me of? It reminded me of something premade that comes in a bag and thrown in boiling water to heat up.

Really disappointed. We had just wasted money on food that tasted nasty and we were walking out hungry. Never, ever, again. Visited this location June 2014."}
{"text":"Such a fabulous happy hour deal!

The bahamarita was super delicious. Order it if you like tropical goodness, margarita style. If you like coconut..like the malibu rum coconut, you would love the Pineapple Coconut Margarita. Not my cup of tea, but could be yours! I wouldn't recommend the Mojito Cubano unless you're looking for an average glass of mojito. 

Recommendations off appetizers:
Coconut shrimp- Perfect balance of shrimp and batter. Flavor was on point as well. 
Crispy onion rings- JUMBO sized onion rings
Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- Crab can taste a little like the sea, but the shrimp avocado and mango salsa made up for it. This dish tasted really fresh, I would recommend it if you like crab and shrimp. 
Warm spinach dip, chips, and salsa- The salsa was delicious! Artichoke was mediocre. 

Chicken quesadillas- Nothing special
Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sliders- This was okay, wasn't extra savory or anything. 
Habanero wings- Disappointment. Wasn't spicy at all. 

Interior very spacious and our waiter was friendly. Will be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Went for Happy hour. Good menu and prices. 1/2 off for apps. Beer selection was a little weak.

Had the Buttermilk Chicken Sliders which were good. Flavorful chicken and a complimentary sauce. Pickles adding a nice zing to the overall taste.

Also had Firecracker Shrimp. WOW!!!! This was what did it for me. Awesome flavor, great burst of peppery taste with the sauce. Nothing too hot but had just enough heat to enhance the shrimp. This is a must order when you go!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like they're trying very hard to have some sort of authentic cuisine but I'm not sure what they're going for. My wife got the jerk pasta which was decent. A little bland maybe. I had the Cuban sandwich I feel was served exactly how they intended, it just wasn't as good as hoped it would be. I got the black beans and rice as the side and it just seemed as though they were trying too hard to make them authentic and they fell short. The service was very fast and efficient and everyone was friendly. Really no problems to speak of just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wish we had tried this place first when arriving to Las Vegas. Excellent, friendly service! We loved the environment. Felt like we were in the Bahamas with how it was set up. Delicious salmon and shrimp quesadilla. This is a place everyone should try when in Vegas. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like the Caribbean atmosphere.  Wasn't too sure about the mac & cheese w/ a deep fried lobster tail, but the lobster ended up being good & tender.  The jerk chicken & pasta was lacking mostly chicken although it tasted fine.  Really enjoyed the rum flight. Creme brulee good (made fancy by putting in a pineapple ring & using a paper umbrella)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, every time my friends and I don't know what to do for dinner, we always head here. Waiters/waitresses are always nice, speedy, and the price is very good for the amount of food that they stack on your plates."}
{"text":"Mahi Fish tacos were bland and boring...no sauce ($11). The Salmon Special ($13) was dry & tasteless too.  We've loving this place for 5 years because of the amazing flavors and sauces.  Food today didn't have any of those amazing sauces and was void of flavor. Asked the waiter if they forgot the sauce but he said they no longer include the mango sauce with the tacos. I think hospital cafeteria food would have tasted better than what we had today. New cooks? New recipes? The table next to me complaining to the manager about their food too. Sad that one of my favorite restaurants lost it's mojo....but I'll give it 3 stars because the staff was nice and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but I've never been here so I thought, why not?

Why not? Because the food is average at most, nothing special. I ordered four or five small plates to try out and none of them were impressive in my opinion and my friends also thought the same. They do have some good drink mixes that are quite refreshing though, so that I did enjoy.

Service is five stars, our server was SO pleasant and helped us decide on what to order, he also checked with us a few times to make sure everything was still okay. 

Overall, I don't think I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"Came back tonight & Tina waited on us. The food tonight was to die for. I took pictures of everything we had. I don't know what they did but everything is 100% The music was on point. I will bring friends and family to this location."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Tuesday not the best option for lunch. Maybe dinner is better but lunch not so much. The atmosphere is fun and lively and very tropical. But lunch sizes are small for such expensive price and what places doesn't serve fries with the lunch sandwiches but they do for the dinner portion. Makes no sense. The Resturant was clean and the hostess was warm and inviting but my server enjoyed talking to the old men more than little ole me. Strong pass on Bahama Breeze"}
{"text":"Out of town for work & went with co-workers on the recommendation of someone from the local office.

Wise choice! Solid atmosphere w/the island music & decor. 

We each did an appetizer - Conch Fritters, Empanadas, Ahi Tuna Stack & Yuca fries...each quite tasty.

Dinner - one had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, which was delicious w/nice crunch to the just about right coating of breading. One had the wood grilled chicken & seemed genuinely pleased. Another in the group had the Shrimp Creole which had a nice spice to it. 

I had the Carnitas bowl, which w/the combination of chorizo, sweet plantains, garbanzo beams & the cumin/citrus salsa was top notch. Not to mention that the depth of the bowl just seemed to keep going. Filling and delicious! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price.  The pinapple upside down cake was chocolaty and amazing.  Our server, Rand, was great too."}
{"text":"If you like Caribbean flavors and cocktails, this is the restaurant for you. I would go back when in town."}
{"text":"Happy hours my thing...but I do not recommend going here for it. Bartender makes a stiff drink maybe too stiff and when it comes to the menu his recommends were poor we got the two spiciest things with no warning. This comes from a person that hates spice. When I go to a bar I like a personable bartender that asks what do u like what don't you like and when you get a response of oh I mainly just make drinks that turns a customer away. This the reason we left."}
{"text":"It's worth it just for the bathrooms, but this place is excellent for groups. If you're looking for a place to take a work group or hold some sort of work-related event, this place is great. The variety in food will please everyone. The atmosphere is great, and the price isn't too steep."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a while, so good to see their menu has been updated with some great dishes! We had tamarind margaritas (so good), a great dinner and a wonderful server: Jerry. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in town. Both regular & late night if I'm on this side of town. 1/2 off apps & great drink specials. I recommend the lobster & shrimp quesadillas, simply a must try for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food! Can't wait to return to vegas to eat again. A must stop everytime! Live music and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Yuca Fries. All I'm sayin!! Ok, not fair. All the the food here is great. Great staff. Awesome atmosphere and ambiance, from decor to Caribbean music. But seriously tho......YUCA FRIES!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Prices reasonable. The firecracker shrimp was the bomb. Calamari was super tender and the shrimp and lobster quesadillas were right on point. Our first time in Vegas and my cousin invited us. We know where to go when we go back! Oh and can forget the tropical margarita to wash it all down. It waiter was super nice as well. A must stop!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Chain restaurant at its lowest. 

We ordered the coconut shrimp as an app. It was at our table in literally 90 seconds. While I get that it is nice for the food to be there fast, there is NO WAY that it was an order dropped for us, it had to have been a send back or misring as there is no way they could ring the order, fry them, plate them, and run them. The result was the shrimp, which actually tasted ok, were cool from waiting for us to order them.

As for the entrees: the mahi mahi tacos were boring, made with store bought and stale tortillas, and relied on too much crappy salad for the small sliver of fish. The cuban sandwich was even worse, the meat was dry and rubbery.

The coconut shrimp were okay though and would have been good if they were hot, and the tomato salad was tasty. Everything else was just crap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! Instantly makes you fell like you are on vacation! Love the decor and food! If you're open to new things, it's fantastic. They also have some conventional food if you are wanting a Burger, steak, or ribs!"}
{"text":"I was recommended the coconut shrimp and I was not disappointed by the coconut shrimp tacos I ordered. Yum!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card that was good for one of several different restaurants, including the Yard House and Olive Garden. But the one that looked the most appealing (mostly, since we'd never heard of it) was Bahama Breeze. Seeing that the closest location was the one in Vegas, we saved the gift card for our trip to the Strip.

Walking in this place was like entering into a different world. It was amazing. They don't commit to theme so blatantly like Rainforest Cafe or places like that, but in a natural and organic way where it still feels homey. 

The lady who sat us down spent a couple minutes explaining to us what she liked best on the menu. Then, our waiter, Eamon, got over to us and he, too, gave us his take on the menu, breaking down each section, since he knew we had never been there before. 

I'm the type of guy that likes to get what's popular at any restaurant, so he informed me that the Jerk Chicken was their best item. 

I was hesitant about it, because jerk chicken has not really ever been my style. But with risk comes reward, and this reward was worth it.

The meal ($17) came with three large pieces of bone-in chicken, black beans, rice, and plantains. The chicken was some of the most moist I've ever eaten, and the spices on the chicken loaded it with some amazing flavors without ever being too spicy. You'll definitely remember the taste more than the spiciness. The black beans were probably the best I've had. And the plantains were great (if you like plantains), especially when dipped in the Caribbean salsa that they put there on the plate. The rice was a little too saffrony for me and I wasn't a big fan, but my fiancee loved it.

She ordered the Skillet Jerk Shrimp ($12), which was amazingly tasty! It was jam-packed with flavor, and came with a garlic-thyme butter sauce that I couldn't stop dipping the bread in (her dish came with a roll of bread). 

Altogether, this place will now be a mainstay on our trips into town, much like the Peppermill has become. The waiter was amazing and so was all of the food and the atmosphere. The prices, also, were very reasonable--especially considering what town we were in."}
{"text":"I always love any chance to go here.  I love the coconut shrimp.  Usually the staff is really nice and never really had any issues.  The only down fall is that they handle big parties well.  We were having a going away dinner for a friend and we call about a week before hand to make sure that they could handle a party of 28.  We were told no problem, but when we got there, they were not ready for us.  We had a total of 3 servers to waited on us.  They were very nice and friendly. Which made up for the delay in getting our tables ready."}
{"text":"We had great service!!! And our food was totally awesome, we wish we had come here before!!"}
{"text":"I would like to formally thank Bahama Breeze and their staff for their sincere efforts towards RUINING my family reunion dinner on Saturday, July 23, 2011.  God Bless my mother and my aunts for their hard work in putting this thing on and for keeping everyone else patient while this disaster was taking place.  This was by far the worst6 display of service I have ever seen and several formal letters are being sent to their corporate office as I write this.  

My family had made arrangements with their business office to hold our reunion here for a buffet-style dinner.  We do not live in Las Vegas (none of us do) so we did everything via fax and phone.  We have been to this location on several occasions over the years, so we are familiar with the food and always had really good service here.  I also always enjoyed the food, so we thought this would be the perfect place to host our family reunion dinner.  Anyway, so the contract we made was for three main entrees (seafood paella, baby back ribs and Jamaican grilled chicken) , three side dishes (yellow rice, green beans, creamed sweet potatoes) and their signature green salad.  This was all to be served buffet-style with unlimited choice of soft drinks, tea/coffee and iced tea. The price negotiated was $35 per person.  We brought in our own cakes for dessert which they kept in the back refrigerated for us.  This was a group of approximately 31 people.  Kids' menu items were to be paid for separately as well as cocktails, beer and wine. Each table would get their own bill for those things separately (and for anything else you want on the regular menu).

From the beginning, service problems began.  There were two servers who primarily came in our area.  Over the course of the evening, we had to literally chase these people down for drinks and just basic service.  It was horrible.  I noticed that the buffet serving containers were quite small for the amount of people in party and they emptied very quickly.  Nobody was there to replace to food.  People sat with food while others had to wait a long time before being able to get food.  The salad bowl probably could serve about 6 to 8 people, so when that emptied (no other food was out or available at this point), people just sat their for a good 20 minutes before they brought out more.  This was the ongoing theme of the night.  Need a refill on that ice tea? Be prepare to never get it unless you run around trying to find the waiter to get some.  Nobody was attending to our party.  Nobody was busing the plates so we literally had pile them in the middle table.  Kids' orders were not brought out in a timely manner so the kids were eating like an hour into dinner service.  Remember the tea and coffee? None was offered to anyone and we paid for it!  And to top off , when the staff did make an appearance, they had really nasty attitudes about it.  No apologies.  So where was the manager in all this? Certainly not rolling up his sleeves trying to help his clearly overwhelmed waitstaff.  He was somewhere else, making excuses that there were other big parties going on.  NOT OUR PROBLEM.  

Look, this was clearly an understaffed event and the lack of attention to ANY sort of detail shows that, but come on! It was just blatantly bad.  Poor attitude and unapologetic staff is just a reflection of the management's nonchalance for literally pissing all over this party.  We had babies crying from hunger, we had piled up dirty plates, plenty of empty glasses and annoyed family members.  Thank goodness we are good spirited people, kept the party going and did our raffles and announcements and passed out cake as planned. We tried not to let our experience at Bahama Breeze ruin our getting to catch up with each other and have fun, but damn! Work with us here! We could have just gone to a buffet at one of the casinos for this and we probably should have.

 Oh and I haven't even gotten to how salty the food was!  The paella was nearly inedible even though they did not skimp on seafood, does it matter if they pour a whole container of salt in it?  Dry chicken, hard to cut with my knife.  However, the ribs were decent as were the green beans and sweet potatoes..but wait..something was missing.  Mom did not realize this until after but they forgot our yellow rice.  We have a few people in our party who are allergic to seafood so the paella was out, hence the reason for the yellow rice side.  I guess everything else was so bad we forgot about the missing side. Anyway, my mom called their business office and got it refunded.  Either way, I could think of sooo many other places to host a dinner like this that would have gone so much smoother.  They really should be ashamed for doing such a sloppy-ass job."}
{"text":"Messed up all drinks. They tried to fix but to no avail. Food is good though. Don't expect this to be like the ones in south Florida."}
{"text":"We had a work event here so everything was free. I had no idea that Bahama Breeze was a franchise because there is one in Raleigh North Carolina

Food was good, a lot of fried food though, so beware!"}
{"text":"We started out wanting some good drinks, non alcoholic of course, and it was happy hour. We asked if the non alcoholic drinks were available at a discount and thy told us only the alcoholic drinks were. We didn't understand so we requested a manager. So far not so good...but the manager had a change of heart...so that was good. We shared a chicken cilantro cream dish that was fabulous. We also had some great chicken sliders, coconut shrimp, and some chicken wings.
Overall it was great food, fast service, and cool atmosphere. 
We will defnitely come back."}
{"text":"This was the third time we have visited the Bahama Breeze in Las Vegas and it has been stellar each time.  The food choices are great and the quality excellent.    Our service has always been outstanding and the food delivered has been fresh and hot.  This is one of our favorite places to stop at when we are in town and the prices are very reasonable, especially for Vegas.  Very enjoyable and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever eating here. Thw food was great!  I always wondered and have heard of bahama breeze but where I live there isn't one close. I wish there was.. firdt of all our waitress was so sweet. She was telling us how they cook everything and how everything is fresh. And you can tell everything is! Everything is unique and different. I will be back and planned it already."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and drinks. We had several appetizers, drinks and entrees. It was all delicious! Our server Joe was awesome as well. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Set up is really nice but doesn't make up for everything else. The food is bland and really has no taste. I got the portobello manchega (no taste) my girl got some sort of shrimp plate that just tasted like tomato. Ill give them this, the beef empanadas and artichoke dip were pretty good. House drinks were also very good. Service started off really helpful but drifted shortly. Having the little one with us we found ourselves making a trip to the restroom that you could smell from the bar so watch your step. Don't see us coming back"}
{"text":"We were looking for a reception site for our wedding that was laid back and would give us more time to actually mingle with our guests.  We decided on Bahama Breeze, and it was great!  The food was fantastic!  Our reception was at 9pm so we did the appetizer buffet for about 25 people, and everyone loved the food!  The atmosphere was light and fun, and I think everyone had a good time!  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because a few times throughout the night the staff would come up to me and ask me what to do or what needed to be done, and I kind of felt like it should be their job to already know what should/needed to be done.  Other than that the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a mojito if it is made by Lauren or Nicole!!! They are perfectly made to my taste. I definitely love their menu but o do come for happy hour regularly!!"}
{"text":"We decided to veer off the Strip in search for something different and not \"Strip-priced\" and ended up at Bahama Breeze.

We were pleasantly surprised at their menu, as they offered some of our favorite types of food!  I ordered the jerk chicken wings (of course!) and my daughter ordered their West Indies Patties.  Both were awesome!  The service was also good and our drinks were never empty.

We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time here the food was amazing and it was the bonus happy hours on!!!! Appetisers were 50% off the drink was good the food was amazing and our bar girl Shelly was ours standing and Louis had us all laughing the name night long"}
{"text":"My girlfriend got me hooked on this place...  The jerk fire shrimp!!!!  YES YES!!!  please ask for the sauce be chunky and the bread that you can dip into the chuncky sauce!!! YES YES!!!   :)   The coconut shrimp is recommended as well...!!!

If you go to this place during the happy hour for $20 you can get full on the appetizers(jerk shrimp as I recommend) and at least two drinks.... 

And during the peak hours on the weekends, this is a place you can chill with that special someone and and enjoy a romantic eveing out..."}
{"text":"Less pricey than hotel food and just as good! The drinks were pretty good too. The waitress was a little slow, but she did have quite a few tables."}
{"text":"Service without a SMILE.

2 nights ago I visited this restaurant (Bohama Breeze) based on a recommendation of a friend who said that it would be a fun and tasty experience.It was neither......I left thinking that I have  more fun at Denny's or Jack in the Box.,  i was prepared to just talk about the under par service my group received, but I looked in the faces of the staff and did not see one smile on one face.  Then I wondered if the theory was correct \"A staff treats the customers the same way the management treats them.... then I am glad I do not wor here.   

The service is fair.... by that I mean all the appropriate words were spoken at the appropriate time..  The food was not  worth returning for a second taste..   Skip this experience you won't miss a thing."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, what could be better than a stop at a cool carribean-themed restaurant where the food is yummy and the tropical drinks flow like water. Sounds great huh? Well, you will not find that wonderful theme played out at this location. 

I sat down at the bar and asked if there were any happy hour specials.  There were no happy hour specials. Actually, no happy hour at all. OK, No big deal. Let's just get some food and a drink and move onto the good part! 

Wait, what is that smell all around the bar area? It smells like the first wash sink behind the bar minus the hourly water replacement to make it not smell like Donkey Ass. I am not trying to be funny, it was that bad. OK, No big deal. Let's move onto the good part? 

I ordered the Seafood chowder and an Oak Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Bacon and some pepper-jack cheese. Throw some fries on the side and get me a Pop because the Tropical Beverages are so overpriced.  I can't wait!

The Soup arrived in a bowl on a plate that was so overheated in the microwave that I couldn't eat it without a healthy cooling. There were small bubbles along the edge of the bowl. Never seen that before but anyways, who cares...the good part is coming, right? 

The \"Oak\" grilled sandwich lacked any actual oak flavor and looking back in the kitchen, there was no actual oak fires, unless blue natural gas flame counts. The Chicken Breast, minus Oak flavor or any Grill Lines whatsoever, was placed on one of those thin square buns that fell apart within the first 4-5 bites. No problem, I grabbed my fork and dug back into that grease soaked piece of bun. Certainly the service is the good part, right? 

Well, if being called \"honey\" every time you are addressed by an interesting mid 20's blond haired girl, who looks like a mix of Olivia Newton-John/ Bewitched/ Roseanne Barr, then this is the place for you. 

Oh, the dumb elitist business guys calling their wives idiots and using the F Word every other word was a nice touch. Way to go \"Bahama Breeze\", you thoroughly creeped me out!"}
{"text":"Variety of food and great selection. This place is great if you feel like having a big dinner or small plates and salads. Great service and delicious food. Our server, Jerry, went above and beyond to make out time special. There was also a reggae band playing. All in all, it was a perfect experience. I will definitely come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here again out with my gorgeous wifey,  great Sunday. Hung out nice lunch , took a Sunday afternoon nap now hanging in Vegas.  Life is Good"}
{"text":"After dinner drink and snacks on Wednesday, 8/5/15 (first time visiting)

I came with a huge party of about 40 people. It took about 30 minutes to be seated in the cabana area. They have a parking lot but it got full pretty fast. The servers were friendly. We grabbed drinks from the bar area while waiting for our table.

Outside the restaurant near our tables, they have a performer playing live music. There's a dance floor too.

The appetizers we had were average tasting. We ordered the coconut shrimp, chicken wings, onion rings fried with coconut flakes, garlic shrimp with bread, and mojitos. 

I haven't gotten a chance to try items off their regular menu. In terms of enjoying ourselves for late night entertainment and light refreshments, it was great especially with 40 of us all together. They were able to split our checks too."}
{"text":"No question my worse meal ever in LV; covering 40 years of coming here each year.  My friends didn't care for their meals either.  Chicken and chorizo pasta, crab avocado salad or fish tacos- all terrible.  No one should like writing a bad review; me especially, but terrible is terrible.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Restaurant is super cute.  Was asked to sit in the bar since I was alone.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  Had the coconut shrimp.  They were good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"We have stopped several times at this establishment on our way to/from the airport.  It is a decent restaurant but I guess its biggest plus is the actual restaurant and the \"summery\" atmosphere it gives you.  We also never had any problem with the service but the food is nothing extraordinarily good.  It is not bad too, just normal, \"neutral\" food.  Having said that I believe it is a good option if it is on your way - and I am sure I will go back at some point - but I do not think I would go out of my way to have a meal here."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I come to Bahama Breeze. The food is always quick, hot, and DELICIOUS!!! MMMMMMMMMM! the customer service is superb. My favorite dish, well appetizer, is the Jerk Shrimp! It's comes with bread for you to dip in the sauce and it is absolutely delicious!!! You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Great service! I came on a weekday after the lunch rush and enjoyed fast service.  I sat at the bar with Bob. Enjoyed a coupla tasty mojitos! The coconut shrimp are awesome!"}
{"text":"Seriously? Chicken wings came out in 3 minutes. That's amazing! How can you cook chicken in 3 minutes?
Chorizo sliders were soggy, had to send them back. If you're looking for pre-made food this is your place. If you like good, quality food I don't recommend Bahamas Breeze."}
{"text":"We sent back 2 dishes and decided not to order anything else. My entire mouth was assaulted by salt. 

We tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after 2 bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty; I couldn't get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.

The flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic - It didn't offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didn't even taste much jerk seasoning - only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for 3 people to share. 

Also, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and Yard-House makes it better. 

The manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes. He also offended us by suggesting that we probably didn't know what jerk seasoning tasted like. lol. I'm not even going to argue it. We ended up heading to In-N-Out and grabbing some burgers after this failed dinner."}
{"text":"Happy Hour M-F 4-6pm and Su-Th 9-close

Happy Hour Specials are $3-$5 drink specials and half priced appetizers.  

Came in for Rumtoberfest and to check out some drink flights I had seen online.  Drink flights are my fave cause I love trying everything.  Started with the Higgla's Happy Juice a 3 cocktail flight.  It was OK so we decided to order The Rum Raid an 8 cocktail flight.  We didn't realize that it had 3 of the same flavors as our previous flight.  Most of the cocktails tasted very similar, surprisingly we only liked a few.  We finished off with a margarita flight and that was by far the best drinks of the night.  

For food we ordered Jamaican Chicken Wings, Key West Nachos, Coconut Shrimp, Firecracker Shrimp and Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla.  Food was good.  Nothing amazing but a great price at half off.  Portions were large.  I was disappointed that the nachos did not have plantain chips like it said on the menu.  

Service was average.  We had multiple bartenders in the few hours we were there.  None of them were very personable or friendly."}

{"text":"Hearty food, good flavor and good quality. 

I wasn't dazzled but I left full. The Jerk chicken pasta was great but Huge! Service was good and ample free parking. 

I kinda felt like I was in an all inclusive resort in the Bahamas. Anyway, I would eat here again but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner out. There was half price appetizers and drink specials from 4-6.  Isha was our server and she was very nice and on top of everything.  Will definitely be back to try some of their drinks."}
{"text":"I thought 3.5 stars a little unfair for this restaurant. I was hesitating about this place but my friend had recommended it to me so I have it a try. They have a lot of types of drinks and I was glad they also had not alcohol drinks. BTY I recommend their Virgin Pina Colada. I enjoyed sitting outside since the weather was good, I felt I was near to the Ocean or in the West (lol!!) because of the decoration and the latino music. I just thought the meal took so long for coming so I recommend you order some tapas or little bites."}
{"text":"I have slept on this little gem.  The avocado & crab salad is a must!  Very reasonably priced and a good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is casual .....next to the strip I took my friend there for his birthday lunch because that's where he wanted to go... This was my first time here it is a Saturday we went at 2 PM no reservation was needed it was not packed however we were unable to sit outside because the servers had closed it for some reason so I was a bit disappointed. The reason this place gets four stars is because the server was great the service was amazing she was super attentive super nice and gave us a lot of recommendations. We ordered the Caribbean lobster and Mac and cheese plate the lobster was fried and it was oh so delicious... I made the mistake of getting a Caesar salad which was good but my eyes definitely went for the spinach dip and chips that we ordered as an appetizer... As far as drinks get the Hibiscus Margarita !!!tasted like juice yum!!! Or the Tamarind margarita with 1800 Reposado !!!...the whole meal for two with appetizers and drinks and even a chocolate dessert and $20 tip came out total $113!!!! Pretty good for all we ate !!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Hospitality and service was great. Got a table right away. Food tasted great. Great food variety. I just feel like I have to go there a few more times to try different foods."}
{"text":"The first time we went we were seated right away due to our reservation, we were seated outside, the environment was very relaxed, very roomy, played good music (sometimes a band will play) and service was very quick. The food was really good and properly cooked. We were constantly checked every 10 mins or so.

Second time was good as well, again seated right away due to our reservation, the lady at the frontdesk was a bit rude but only to her bussers, the table wasnt properly set but they fixed it right away once we acknowledge it. Same thing, the food was great and we were constantly checked. Overall, I loved it and we will definitely going back here."}
{"text":"Such a fun and tropical and happy feeling environment. The service was very good, although not very personal. The food is a little better than average. The cocktails are delicious."}
{"text":"Thanks to my boyfriend for introducing me to this place. They got a wide variety of selections to chose from. We went for lunch and prices were the norm.
There were plenty of appetizers and alcoholic beverages available. So for those of you who do happy hour with co workers, friends, significant others, on a date...etc..I think this would be a great place to go to whichever the occasion is.

For those who are always indecisive with decisions, Bahama Breeze's menu may be hard for you to choose just one thing to order. I was in between a couple dishes but in the end, I went for something healthy: a shrimp rice bowl with grilled/sauteed veggies. Portions were on point for lunch. It was just the right amount to fill me up without that \"ugh, I feel so fat and bloated\" feeling. However, I DO get full easily though so hmm... My boyfriend got the Caribbean jerk chicken pasta. There was mushrooms in it also. Mine cost $8.95 and his pasta cost....$10-13 I think??? It's been awhile so don't quote me on the exact prices.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you look at my profile it's all positive reviews..
I never leave a negative review 


Been to this place every day for the past 4 days. With a group of 4-7 people. The service was awesome everyday as well as the food...

Today we arrived and they were out of at least 8 items. We ordered blue moons for the entire party yet 5-7 minutes after the server came back and said he couldn't figure out what was wrong with the draft beer.?!?! How hard is it to change the keg? 

Some of our food was decent but our soup came out tasting like cheap nachos.. strangely enough...
The server was a nice dude he tried his best but the execution was garbage...he forgot two of our items  so we had to reorder...not a big deal.

A runner brought over an item that was supposedly out of stock to our table and then another runner took it away....confusing us 

We ordered 90$ worth of food btw

At this point we asked the manager to come over and talk to us.. we are from the industry, all corporate managers, chefs, It.... 60 years experience plus. So we were very nice and just brought to her attention these issues...she apologized and said they were experiencing a lot higher business than usual. No problem...we kept enjoying dinner with good conversation and a couple of beers

We ordered the churrasco
This is where things got bad. They brought over what looked like an unfinished plate...it was suppose to bring two sides and rice and instead t was just rice. When we asked why there were no sides they said they were out but st no time did the server or manager offer us substitutions or comps for the out of stock items...
Check the pic this is the saddest dish I've ever seen. 

The worst part is that when we talked to the manager again......she responded by saying that she had already messaged her gm...she said she was a marketing manager what type of marketing manager allows this type of product to go out to guests who already complained. She was in the expo window when that came out. Not to mention it wasn't churrasco it was skirt steak. Our server didn't even inform us that that would be what we would be getting...tasted horrible as well.... 

The manager said she didn't know they ran out ? Seriously guys? You need to take care of your guests...I come from the service industry and I take care of my fuck ups. It doesn't take much to comp a couple items or actually genuinely apologize and offer a solution. Instead she just told us that she that she told her GM and that she agreed with us, like okay and what? What are you going to do to make up for all these inconveniences ? 

She took the churrasco off the bill but nothing else.
The server was a nice dude and the manager seemed okay ...but this was just ridiculous. We are never returning again. It's sad because a couple of days ago a manager dropped business cards for us all...not thanks man, this is how you take care of guests? That have spent  hundreds of dollars consistently for almost a whole week. 

I don't want anyone to contact me I don't want anything for free. Just get a grip on your service.

We were charged for the entire bill, except the churrasco, nothing was done to make up for the lack of items or the lack of competence by not  being able to provide the beers we ordered....
Or informing us that we wouldn't get the items we ordered...very frustrating. No comps for the meal or offer to fix things. 

I'm done I'm just getting more frustrated...taking about it...very sad.

to feel like a non fatass i started with the tropical salad w mixed greens and veggies and all that bs.. and the chicken by itself was superbilicious!!

wasnt enough so i ordered my fat ass a burger with extra bacon. bada bing!

oh i love the vibe here but i def hate myself after i get out everytime

MUST START: with the layered pina colada

MUST TRY: tropical salad (this by itself is enough for the faint stomached)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing check it out! The servers are friendly and the food is great. I recommend the jerk pasta. When I arrived I was sat quickly and met by my server in no time. This is a great place to start or end a evening of fun. Ps... ask for Travis, Anthony or Quinton they are just wonderful!"}
{"text":"Glad to see corporate there last night. I had the best experience. All bases covered. My server...Danny anticipated our every need. Food was good. Glad they are turning things around,  will def be back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in years because I remembered spicey food, which I am not crazy about.  Obviously, I didn't know what to order.  A friend and I went there for lunch, and I had a memorable and fabulous meal.  In fact, there was so much food, I had three fabulous meals, and everything was almost as good as leftovers the next two days.  We started out with a virgin cocktail combining layers of slushy kiwi, mango, strawberry and margarita flavors, followed by an excellent house salad with a tasty citrus vinegarette house dressing.  The Shrimp and Lobster Linguine with mushrooms in a cream and brandy sauce was mouth-wateringly delicious. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse on a brownie base covered with whipped cream, toasted almond slices, chocolate sauce and Creme Anglaise.  I'd go back just to have that again.  It was a little pricey for lunch, but would be reasonable for dinner.  Our server, Tim, went out of his way to be friendly and helpful.  We had our choice of indoor or outdoor dining.  It was a delightful experience in all aspects."}
{"text":"Wandered into Bahama Breeze on Memorial Day Weekend and were seated right away. The restaurant is fabulously decorated in a tropical island theme and overall is a good place to go and avoid the chaos of The Strip.  

Whether you sit outside or on the patio, you will get the feel of the islands. Although the food is good, it can get a bit pricey for what it is. I had the Jamaican grilled chicken and it was $18. Tasty but $18 is a bit steep. My wife had a sandwhich for around $12.

The signature Mojito, \"Mojito Cubano\"  was overly fufu.  They pack the drink with ice and make it like a slushy.  I asked for my second with significantly less ice and it still had too much.  

Given the ambiance and good food, I have given 4 stars.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the firecracker shrimp, the outdoor seating is very breezy and nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful would def come back again"}
{"text":"We met 2 couples at Bahama Breeze for Sunday afternoon dinner to plan an upcoming vacation.  This was our first time there and we were looking forward to it.  

My boyfriend and I sat separately at the bar - he sat with the boys and I with the girls.  I ordered a glass of wine and found the service to be SLOOWWW (even though the barmaid was not busy).  The gentlemen were served their beers before the women received their drinks.  

We were seated at a booth for 6 in the bar area.  One of our party needed to sit on a stiff-backed chair due to a recent surgery.  When we attempted to pull a chair to the head of the booth we were told that because of the \"fire code\" we couldn't put someone in the bar aisle.  We were subsequently moved to a tropically steamy area of the restaurant that resembled a bad time-share at Disney World.  If I wanted to eat in the glaring light of day under plastic palm trees I would have booked a meal at the local tanning salon.

We ordered lovely appetizers (edamame - a little dry, firecracker shrimp - yummy, conch fritters - amazing!)  We ordered from the dinner menu (the lunch menu looks as if they couldn't decide what type of food was being served and we were craving something different).  We ordered the Lobster Paella for Two!  The waitress returned sometime later to tell us that it was not available that day.  So we ordered the Seafood Paella which was delicious!

They mis-timed the orders and ended up re-cooking all of our friends' entrees so that we could all eat together.  As a result they comped our appetizers which was completely unnecessary.

Overall the restaurant seems like a fun carribean-themed bar that seems to cater to out-of-towners and young crowds.  The food is ok and overpriced for what you get.  If you want ambience, candlelight, and quiet conversation go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We planned to go to PF Chang but did not want to wait an hour to be seated. Stopped by Bahama breeze and were seated immediately. The reason being the size and seating capacity is easily twice as big as the former. 
I had been to Bahamas breeze in Memphis in 2006 and had the artery clogging humongous onion rings. The chicken kabobs were bland. Never went back.
Now it looks like some of the menu is new. more chicken options. They have a great drinks menu.
 This time we ordered the buttermilk chicken and the chicken Santiago. Both dishes were delicious. Santiago chicken comes in a calorie conscious size. The red pepper sauce tastes so good.  For drinks the parrot punch was on the sweeter side, the blue carcau margarita on the rocks was slightly salty... Both drinks tasted good. Service was little rushed. Ambiance is as usual. 
I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Shelly made our stop great!  We had more than two bad experiences at Satay across the street.

The food was awesome.  I had the jerk chicken and my wife had chipotle beef!  Awesome.

The ultimate pineapple drink! WOW!"}
{"text":"A chain.  Ate at another one in a different state. I had a seafood paella that was dry and didn't have much flavor.  Expensive too for  the quality. Didn't seem fresh but we are in Las vegas as far as fish goes.  My husband got the shrimp and lobster quesadillas and they seemed ok.  Drinks weren't very good either. The Yelp happy hours weren't right.  It said 3-6, but didn't start till 4-6.  They should have honored the price due to wrong advertisement!  Anyway, won't go back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Eating in is okay, the menu has some good stuff but its the food doesn't really merit the price point.  On top of that, I feel like everyrime I go there there's a loud family nearby.

The half priced appetizers during happy hour were a much more worthwhile visit, so 3 stars."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing! I'm a researcher and please believe I did my due diligence to see what was popular, and what everyone loves here. I had the Beef empanadas (they were ok) shrimp pasta (super bland and watery so I sent it back) and my friend had the fried chicken (plate was super cold and we had to send it back). I then got the jerk shrimp appetizer and it was fine but nothing to write home about.  Not authentic Caribbean in any way shape or form. I did like the music and the ambiance as cool. Also my server was very nice so those are the two stars! Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Newer items and portion smaller. Quality still good as well as drinks are strong. Price for two about 80.00. Great family place and a nice location away from strip. Still had to box home so portions that are sliced are not really that small."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place because we were close by and were in the mood for some fruity drinks. 

I had the skinny mojito and my lady had the bahama-rita. The drinks were the best part of our experience. Both were awesome and reasonably priced. 

We had the fish taco's and a cheeseburger. The fish taco's tasted like a sewer, but my cheeseburger was ok. The quality of ground meat wasn't really of my liking, but the avocado was great. 

This place is huge and it felt like we were secluded in our own little corner--too lonely.  I definately would have preferred to sit closer to the center of the restaurant.  I don't think they clean that part of the building because we saw a lot of dust falling from somewhere right above our food. The table light illuminated the particles as we covered our drinks and plates with our hands. Ummm yeah. A few more drinks and we probably wouldn't have noticed. Unfortunately we weren't that saucy.  

WIth so many good restaurants in the area, I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Luis always makes the best drinks and the happy hour can't be beat. One of mine and my girlfriends favorite spots for our night off"}
{"text":"I'd love to rate this restaurant 5 stars on their food, however, experience and service, horrible. Our waitress, Paris? I believe, was awful. She seemed annoyed we were even there. Took about 20 minutes to get drinks, and then never brought a second round. We had to track down a manager to get them. 1/5 dishes came out correctly. And the last two dishes came out 45 minutes after everyone else's. I was very excited to come here and celebrate my birthday with my friends, however the service and the lack of urgency ruined it. Our server never came back to explain what happened or why it took so long to get our food. My friend and I waited 30+ minutes for our food after the other three at our tables received their food? Server never said what happened or sorry. She didn't check on us or anything. Forgot our sides as well. The only reason I would even consider coming back was because my food was delicious. We went through two managers and a 20+ minute wait to get our checks! Not sure what was going on here, but we were all very disappointed. A friend asked the server what they did for birthdays and she said very annoyed nothing really besides writing on a plate....... and never brought it out. I just felt I wasn't valued as a customer and an not welcomed on my birthday. Thanks for ruining it Paris."}
{"text":"Early lunch before we headed back to Cali. We had just came in from a flight from NY and decided to have lunch before we left the area. We had saw this place a week before we left and decided to give it a try. The theme is Caribbean cuisine. Lots of jerk choices and non jerk choices but just think being away on an island. The vibe and music playing all a taste of Caribbean and reggae tunes. We had beef empanadas, fresh juicy fried chicken sandwiched by fried green plantain, oxtails chicken tortilla soup (more chunks of chicken than soup) and jackfruit tacos. The food was tasty and fresh. They had a plethora of drink choices but since we were driving we didnt partake. But they looked yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a specialty drink that I requested be tweaked a little bit. The bartender came over to make sure he was making exactly what I wanted and it turned out delicious; Mango Jalapeno Mojito, YUM! 

Leilani was our server and she was great! She had awesome recommendations. I had the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Firecracker shrimp for an app. I would order both again.

They had live music majority of our visit. Great atmosphere. Will return and will request Leilani"}
{"text":"I love Bahama Breeze. I've eaten at several in the U.S. and this one is just as great as the others. The tropical drinks put you in a real island state of mind. I love the Rum Runner on the rocks. Reminds me of laying on a beautiful beach in Florida! The jerk chicken is great. Just like the jerk chicken in the Caribbean that I've tasted. Also the empanadas are very good too. There are a lot of great dishes here from full plate steaks down to specialty tacos and of course wonderful burgers custom made! Save room for dessert. Rebecca's Key Lime Pie is homemade and tastes like you're in Key West! Such a good place to go when you're craving food from anywhere in the Caribbean islands."}
{"text":"Dining here with my husband during a non busy time .Very disappointing service - Kurt ( name on the receipt) was our server and I ordered the fish tacos after specifically asking if the flour tortillas could be substituted for corn - at first he said \" we don't to that\" and the. I said - I can't east wheat could you ask- and then he came back to say he could have them made with corn. When the food came out I started with my soup, and then  went to take a bite of the tacos and realized the tortillas were flour. I quickly empty the content of tacos I to my soup bowl right when Kurt was walking by to ask how our food was - I told him that the tortillas were still flour and he said \" let me take them out of your way ' wow no attempt at service recovery ,no offer to bring out corn tortillas and no apology! We are locals who would have been back as This was our first visit and based on this experience it will be our last - please teach your team how to make things up of they make a mistake - everyone understands that things happen but staff need to know how to make it right when they screw up"}
{"text":"Below average I don't see why so many in here the service poor and the food is just average think twice before making the decision to eat here"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is so inviting and relaxing. The food is great and they make amazing drinks! The service is awesome and they all seem to like working there!
I am planning my 20th class reunion and I want to have our banquet here and I can't wait for next year to get here! The packages they sent are reasonable and I'm sure we will have an awesome time!!! Until then I will continue to visit them when I'm in the mood for Caribbean food and the BOMB drinks!"}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch (Sunday) and sat out in the indoor patio. The place was not crowded at all and so we got a lot of attention from our AWESOME server, Gerald. He was really silly and down to earth; he didnt have to try to impress us to make us like him! I got a salad with fruit and shrimp and it was heavenly! Got the top shelf margarita as well - it was a little more sour than im used to but was still pretty good. Overall, beautiful restaurant for a calm weekend lunch. We both felt like we were far away from the Vegas desert dining in there!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, I highly suggest the fire cracker shrimp or Habanero wings. Great service, shout out to Chanel for the amazing first impression and Donna for the outstanding service as well.
Bahama Breeze the place to go! I wish we had one in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My half tried their mahi-mahi, it wasn't to his appeal.  The jerk chicken is so good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years - the food and service was Great. I like the menu... Nice variety and don't forget the desserts"}
{"text":"Really love this place. I am giving two stars simply because the got rid of the buttermilk chicken sliders. Why would they do this? But they kept other crap on the menu?

Food is good so is service. However if you like the sliders don't come back. I will question if I ever do."}
{"text":"I went here Monday night with girlfriend's Cuban family with high expectations because someone recommended it to us. Exterior was very fancy, and beachy. The restaurant is bigger than I thought with many sections. 

I scrolled through Yelp to search for references of what to order. My family end up ordered Cheese Curds (cheese stuffed fried yucca) Jamaican Jerky Chicken, Seafood Paellas, a stack of Short Ribs BBQ, Cheddar Burger and fries sweet plantain. We loved the Cheese Curds. They were crunchy, cheese oozed delicious. We ended up with two orders of that. The Jamaican Jerky Chicken was delicious, the portion was huge! Half a chicken grilled with special sauce and yellow rice with fried sweet plantains. The plantains were thick cut and fried to perfection. We Cubans loved it. The Seafood Paellas were not that great. The consistency wasn't really true Paella but the flavor was there. The seafood wasn't as fresh, mussels slightly overcooked, though fish was flaky and cooked well. Paellas weren't impressive, average, but portion was also very big! Each can easily feed two people. My sister-in-law's burger was good (you can't go wrong with burger they should all taste how they should taste). My BBQ ribs were ok, again, they tasted just like how should taste. Sweet and smokey. There wasn't any special twist or spin added onto it. 

Overall the experience was meh. With the bill $120 in total, we expected more. It was filling but wasn't satisfying. I heard good things about it, but maybe we ordered the wrong things because everything was just ok."}
{"text":"Terrific place for a date! I had the Coconut Shrimp appetizer, which came with a sweet & spicy sauce! The Piña Colada drink was delicious, very sweet, & I don't think I could drink two because of that. I ordered the Mahi Mahi with a mango and pineapple glaze. The fish was cooked perfect, the presentation of the plate with the crisped banana slices inserted into the sweet potatoes with cinnamon was a fancy touch. We'll definitely be back, even though it was a drive from our house!"}
{"text":"I loved this place- nice Caribbean decorating, extremely friendly servers, good prices and a great menu. 

We ordered the 
Coconut shrimp tacos-amazing
Lobster and shrimp quesadilla was great
Beef bowl delicious
Steak was perfectly cooked

Our first night-Margo was our server and she was sweet, funny, informative and attentive. 

I enjoyed it so much.... several nights later when most of my friends went to Morton's- I opted to come back with my daughter. Our server on the second night was Anita- and she was just as excellent as Margo. 

We ordered the tacos (so good had to choose them again) 
Protein style cheese burger- just \"ok\"
Adler beer is INCREDIBLE 

Top notch waitresses, yummy food, fun atmosphere and good prices. Can not go wrong her!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice atmosphere, good food, and great drinks. This restaurant was next to our hotel and we went there on more than one occasion.  Nice \"at home\" feel while you're on vacation."}
{"text":"We come here periodically when we have out of town guests.  Everyone seems to enjoy the menu and food. I finally decided to write a review of 2 visits this past week.  The first was mid-week with a party of 10.  There was a special lunch menu that offered perfect portions.  Everyone loved the salads and I love the beef empanadas.  The food was very tasty and was served fresh and hot items were hot.  The service couldn't have been better.  
We went again on Sunday and got the same great service by Alexis H. and the food was again very good.  We appreciate that the service and food here are so consistently wonderful."}
{"text":"We've come here many times and the experience is always great!  The Jamaican Jerk Wings are so delicious and full of flavor we get them every time.  We try to get different things and every dish has been spot on!  This time I got the sirloin topped with crab and served with mashed potatoes and the steak was cooked perfectly!  Our server was awesome and gave us great recommendations-we talked as if we had known each other for years- a great time:)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch. Our server Troy was on top of everything. He made sure the baby's food was served right away. He checked back frequently and was always positive and helpful. Everything we ordered, food and drink, was top notch. Really...it's not just the rum talking ;)"}
{"text":"Everything was great the food was BOMB!!! service was excellent!!
I wanted to come back again while I was still there lol"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I eat here every time I come to Vegas. Thia trip I had a crab cake with cilantro lime dressing. It was delicious as I expected! The almond crusted salmon was fresh, flaky, and cooked just right.   I can drink their coconut mojitos over...and over...and over!! 

Our waiter, Jessie, was the best! He was helpful in referring foods to my friend and kept us laughing the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"We came for the outdoor music and drinks. Well, the music was great!! The reggae made you feel like you were on vacation!! The drinks were good, but not as pictured on the menu! The cactus juice schnapps wasn't even filled to the top????I felt like I was cheated out of what I paid for. The tiered layers on the frozen drink seemed like it was just mixed in. Disappointed with the drinks. I can't comment on the food,  but will give it another go maybe the bartender might have had an off night. If your looking for outdoor music this would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few dozen times over the past couple of years. Never had a bad experience or meal. Friendly service that is more than happy to provide accommodations if you have food allergies (I don't, but my family does). Great place!"}
{"text":"I generally don't like any kind of chain restaurant, so I walked into BB preparing to absolutely hate it.  (We were invited there by friends.)  I will say upfront that if, by some chance, we were in the Robinson Mall area and wanted something to eat, we would probably consider visiting BB again.  

We started off with a terrific server - Mike - but he had to leave in the middle of the meal.  He was attentive, warm and friendly.  He made some good recommendations (the marinated wings and goat cheese appetizers) and answered all of our questions patiently and fully.  Unfortunate, the server who replaced him - Sue - apparently thought our table of five wasn't worth the effort. if we needed anything, we had to flag her down - almost grab her - as she breezed past our table. 

As I said, the wings and goat cheese/bread rounds were very good.  

My wife had a fruit/chicken salad that was light, very flavorful and well-portioned.

I, on the other hand, ordered the coconut shrimp dinner and a caesar salad.  The salad was limp and tasteless.  The shrimp  coating was more bread than coconut, and the shrimp themselves were rubbery in both texture and taste.  The red rice was cold.  Chilled, almost.  The broccoli, however, was very warm but that's because it was cooked to death.  Limp as pasta; it almost fell apart in a pile of green mush when I moved it with a fork.  (Why do places overcook vegetables like this?)

So, as I said, we might stop back but only for appetizers."}
{"text":"The drinks are the best part of this restaurant they are all good but I suggest the The frozen drinks Their so good I like the Ultimate piña colada. The lobster Mac and cheese is rely good  also the jerk chicken"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often because the food is always delicious.  I'm sad they took my favorite dish off the menu."}
{"text":"This place is actually surprisingly delicious and may be one of my new favorite chains in Pittsburgh.

****

We were craving a huge meal after a long day of Outlet Shopping before the holidays and we decided on Red Lobster. It's hard to beat those cheesy puffs things. I can hit a whole basketful easily in one sitting.

Apparently half of Pittsburgh was craving those same puffs. There was a waitlist for up to an hour. The T family never waits for food - so we decided to go to Bahama Breeze.

We grabbed a takeout menu and scanned it quickly. The prices seemed right as did the selection. We went for it. 

And I can easily say that Bahamaa Breeze brought it. I was extremely satisfied with my almond coated tilapia fish dish, paired with garlic mashed potatotes, and thin green beans. The fish was fresh and buttery - and I almost felt like I was back in SF for a moment - the flavor was so distinct and delicious.

The rest of our party - was just as happy with their meal choices - finding the portions huge, and the quality and flavor - robust.

I have to dock a star though for the creme caramel cheescake, which I expected to be a stand-out. Especially since it was touted as being a Bahama Breeze special. It was grossly disappointing for it's off taste - and pricey for six dollars. I found myself doing something - which i NEVER do at a table. 

I let everybody else finish it, while I just watched. 

But sometimes - you just can't have it all - and I'd like to think that Bahama Breeze is capable of whipping up a quality desert - and I just happened to order the wrong one."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Caribbean food but do love the food offered here! The portion sizes are great and most dishes you can choose small or large. 
I'm a huge fan of their coconut shrimp tacos (choice of 2 or 3). The tacos come with a generous amount of coconut shrimp and an added spice is added with their house style pico. Last night I ordered this dish with a side of their beef tomato salad. The tomatoes were tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with fresh basil. Bold fresh flavors in every bite! My boyfriend always enjoys the Jamacian jerk chicken pasta. I've never tried it but it looks delicious (if you like jerk chicken). Bowtie pasta is tossed with asparagus, mushrooms and of course chicken. This is another dish you have the choice between large or small.
We came late and took advantage of their happy hour. We don't drink but they offer half off, full size appetizers. If you love quesadillas you have to try theirs! Cheesy, bold flavors and deliciousness!!
Our server last night was Fred. He was so nice and very attentive. Our drinks were never empty and our table was always manicured. He was extremely friendly but allowed us to enjoy our meal without being overbearing. Thank you Fred! I really appreciated your service last night."}
{"text":"Maybe 3 stars isn't nice, but not all places deserve 4 or 5. I'm getting picky. 
My husband loves this place and we've eaten here nearly every day this week.
And that's ok.  He likes the Cobb Salad with jerk chicken added, plus feta cheese,  no bacon. 
This time I got a grilled honey chicken dish with mashed potatoes.  It was fine.  Not incredible.
We like to sit at the bar, you always get better service when you sit at a bar.
The staff here is always great and the various drink options look tasty!"}
{"text":"The best happy hour to go in my opinion! The food to the drinks to the service. They have their game on! Very affordable prices on happy hour menu. I'll suggest sit at the bar section because they have some amazing bartenders back there very friendly and provided amazing service. Jamaican wings and jerk shrimp is a must have. It was tasty! Food came out quick and my drinks never left empty. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Caribbean Chicken Jerk pasta is good.

Service: 
The person that was with me ordered something outside of the menu and the waiter happily searched for it and came thru. 

They close at 11pm."}
{"text":"Soup and salad for a light lunch. Brian did a great job. No key lime pie. Manager made it right kinda. The pinapp"}

{"text":"I received a gift card for a Darden Restaurant for Christmas.  Choice of dining at Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52, or Bahama Breeze.  I was recommended by some Las Vegas residents to try Bahama Breeze. 

Wednesday night on January 14, 2015 was the first time I visited Bahama Breeze to have a meal.  This night I had my cousin and her family from Henderson join me for the dinner.  I found out that they have not eaten at Bahama Breeze as well.  A first time dining experience for the entire family to enjoy.

A total of six individuals in our group (M1, M2, and M3 are the men.  F1, F2, and F3 are the females).  F1 (my cousin) ordered the garden salad and the ribs with fries.  F2 (me) ordered the Bahamian Seafood Chowder and Buttermilk Chicken Piccata with mashed potatoes.  M1 (cousin's companion) ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer as well as the coconut shrimp meal with broccoli.  M2 (companion's son) ordered a Portabello Burger with fries.  M3 (cousin's son) and F3 (companion's daughter) both ordered pasta.  One had asparagus and mushroom in the pasta while the other eliminated the asparagus.  Everyone finished their meal.  They all agreed that what they ordered for dinner was delicious.  Each dish was served with the right portion...just enough to make a person stuffed to the max. 

The restaurant itself is pretty big.  There's one section of the restaurant that can be used for reserved parties and it had a television for the customers to watch.  There was dinner music provided by a man playing the guitar and he sang a lot of cover songs.  He was located near the bar area and right behind the wishing pond.  The ceiling fans are actually the propellers from the boats.  The restrooms were very clean and there was a mouthwash dispenser for customers to use before or after a meal....that's one thing you hardly see in restaurant restrooms.  

Overall everyone enjoyed the first time dining experience here at Bahama Breeze.  Employees were friendly and the waiters made sure that the drinks were not empty. Facility was clean and very beautiful.  Another major plus about the restaurant is that Bahama Breeze passed the Nevada health inspection by receiving a grade A. For my cousin and her extended family it would be a once in every six months treat for date night or family outings since the entree items are pricey."}
{"text":"We came here saturday afternoon for lunch and had a very pleasant experience! We had the crab, shrimp, mango, and avocado stack which was absolutely amazing.  The crab and shrimp was very fresh and the mango and avocado complimented them perfectly.  

I had the coconut shrimp and Bill ordered the swordfish.  We were both very impressed by how fresh and light his swordfish was....literally melted in your mouth! And....coconut shrimp is my absolute favorite and I felt that the shrimp was cooked just right and not at all rubbery.

The service was okay but the atmosphere was very peaceful and for a second made us think we were back home in Florida! I would definitely go back.

CON: It is on the pricier side but, nothing extreme just average \"chain restaurant\" prices."}
{"text":"Three of us got the shrimp and grits which I thought was very good and stacked up well to the others I've had and went well both one of their margaritas. The fish tacos were tasty and fresh from what my girlfriend said. The staff was very accommodating to our big party size and attentive with a good atmosphere I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix and discovered that this place was closed down! I'm so sad! This had to be the best restaurant I have ever gone to when i use to live in Phoenix. Everythig i had ever ordered  was amazing and the presentation was off the hook. So disappointed bc I wanted to take my new husband here to experience it. Now I can't."}
{"text":"I am never really a fan of chain restaurants, but Bahama Breeze always impresses me. The service is always quick and friendly, and their entrees are mostly high quality. I love the live one man band on Friday evenings!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, but this place was OK. The portions for what you pay is just ridiculous. One of my group members had ordered a Jamaican flavored chicken wings or something and it came out with like 2-3 wings. I ordered mildly flavored chicken wings and it looked like the microwaveable chicken wings from WalMart or Smiths. I had about 3 pieces of wings and a little bits of rice spread about to make it look whole on the plate. Idk about everyone else, but wouldn't go here again.."}
{"text":"I wish we could break out food vs everything else.

We arrived around 8 on a Saturday night and waited at the bar for 10 minutes.  We had fruity frozen drinks that were yummy.  I could only do one but my drink came with this little cup clipped to the glass that had an extra shot of tequila in it! Win!    Removing the little cup? Spilled half.  Fail.  And the bar was stickier than a daycares floors on ice cream day.

Place was clean.  A little worn...but again, sticky...there were carpets there too that were...anyone? Sticky. 

Server was nice...spoke English and knew she was there to serve and had valid recommendations.  I had the beef and rice bowl which had some other veggies in it...some mango too...pretty good.  Weak on the meat though.  

Wife had the fish special...she gave it four stars.

Drinks were very slow...but my real feedback is clean and repair.  Clean. And repair.

Food was large portions, had a island/carribean feel...solid four stars."}
{"text":"What the hell were we thinking? Did we actually used to like this place? Well, never again. There are just far too many wonderful, independently-owned eateries in Cleveland that serve natural, whole foods for us to ever waste our money again on such mass-marketed, lowest common denominator, processed  food again. The truth? We came here because we were headed to the Winking Lizard down the road but there wasn't a single parking spot in the joint, our judgement clearly clouded by hunger, lead us here.

I don't understand why places like Bahama Breeze are always crowded. Can someone explain to me why people think this is a \"destination\"? I can imagine all of the hotels surrounding this particular location, stuffed with overweight, middle-aged middle managers helps the bottom line (what the hell else should they do, eat at Red Robin or Red Lobster or Long Horn?). From the cheesy pseudo Caribbean decor to the sticky tables and menus (ick) it's a B-movie of a restaurant. Piped in ethic music, blasting over the outdoor speakers, some goofball playing steel drums in the atrium, a constant smell of stale beer and spilled sugary boat drinks, a staff devoid of passion and personality (our server looked through us the entire time and never cracked a smile), tables so close together that you can't get in and out of them without asking another diner to move, and the food, where do I begin.

For starters, the drinks menu is a diabetics nightmare. If you like syrupy, cloyingly sweet, novelty drinks with barely a hint of alcohol to warrant the prices you're in the right place. Here it's all about the fruit juice. The drinks get their own booklet on the table and just about every cocktail is some combination of rum and fruit juice. And the beer list? Boring. They have three draft beers, all macro swill,  and a bottles list that reads like a fraternity refrigerator. Don't be fooled by the Aruba Red, it's an AB-InBev product. It's essentially Bud Light with red #40 dye. Luckily they managed to sneak in a few Great Lakes bottles without anyone noticing (thank this for one of the stars).

If I had to pick a few words to describe the food I'd go with sweet and salty. Just about everything has fruit on it, is served with some kind of sugary dipping sauce and comes pre-loaded with enough salt to put down a rhino (a bowl of their black bean soup has a whopping 1200 mg of sodium).  I certainly can't say that Bahama Breeze is alone in this culinary assault on the American public, but they are definitely adding fuel to the fire. Our meal consisted of the following:

Conch Fritters: I was actually excited to see these on the menu. After all, unless you live in Key West, FL you probably have never even had them before. My excitement didn't last. Five miniature little dough balls, fried and served with a side of, you guessed it, fruity sugar sauce. They reminded me up hush puppies and I couldn't really detect any conch in them. Don't bother.

Bimini Pretzel Twist: I know it's a nutritional wasteland but soft pretzels (and donuts) are like crack to me. I swear them off only to find myself back in their arms time and time again. More a braided pretzel bread than a traditional version, it was great. Sourdough added a nice touch and the Aruba Red beer cheese sauce was guilty good (not nearly enough in the two tablespoon serving, though). For me, the highlight of my meal.

House Salad: Not much to be said about this one. As far as salads go it was actually pretty good. I'm not a fan of the cucumber ribbons because they're a pain the ass to deal with, but I did like the pumpkin seeds and the vinaigrette was quite tasty.

West Indies Chicken Curry Rice Bowl: I was carb-craving and I'm always down for some curry. First, let me say that I don't like hot fruit. It has no place outside of an apple pie or strudel. This dish was packed with it - raisins, pineapple, mango - and it was very sweet. The chicken, what few pieces there was of it, was dried out and chewy. The rice wasn't bad and who doesn't like Naan bread?

Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad: If you're looking for a healthy option on the menu you really can't go wrong with this one, just get it without the blue cheese dressing fat bomb. Sliced chicken breast, bacon, egg, tomato, cheese, pumpkin seeds and avocado. The veggies were fresh and crispy but, once again, they barely serve a half a chicken breast.

I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. It's overpriced, it's a chain, the food is processed, loaded with sugar and salt, and the service is anemic. I'm happy to have chains like Bahama Breeze. They are great for helping me to realize how much I've grown to appreciate small, local eateries staffed with talented chefs that turn out inventive, dishes. We won't be back..ever."}
{"text":"I used to work for Bahama Breeze, St. Louis, so I looked forward to going in and critiquing how this one was run.

The salmon I ordered was delicious, they have taken off the island rice, don't like the new rice. 

Service was good as usual, the servers are always very knowledgeable about the menu and they did not charge me to make a weird substitution. 

The garlic mashed potatoes recipe has clearly changed and they were very....well...shiny? If that makes sense, it was clear to me that they were not handmade or fresh like the used to be, so sorry, you lost a star over my potatoes.

Overall, enjoyable, they have very good specialty drinks. Bill was about $55.00 dollars before tip for three people, with one specialty drink on the bill and no desserts."}
{"text":"This is still my go-to restaurant on my Las Vegas visits... the last couple times have been disappointing though because my favorite menu items were discontinued.

But I decided to try it again and went with something totally new: the ropa vieja sandwich with the side of fruit, no sorbet.

The sandwich was pretty good, could have used something to add flavor or spice but I would get it again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chain restaurant to eat at. Great service and atmosphere, incredible food and delicious mixed drinks. They can be a little pricy so we don't visit often, but when we do it's always a treat.

My one complaint would be that they seem to change their menu a lot which can be disappointing when you go craving a certain meal only to find that it's gone, but there's always great new food to try so I guess it all evens out. I've definitely never been disappointed trying new things there."}
{"text":"The next time you're in Vegas, (particularly on E. Flamingo) don't fool yourself into thinking that Bahama Breeze is some run-of-the-mill, cookie cutter restaurant, a la Applebee's, Chili's etc... 

Simply put: Baham Breeze is the sh*t... mon! I wasn't even hungry and I almost finished my big ass plate of Calypso Shrimp Linguine. Might I add that they use 'Gulf Shrimp' in their shrimp dishes, which if you don't already know ,are not not small shrimp. My wife had the Wood Grilled Tilapia, my son had the Wood Grilled Chicken and my sister had the Jerk chicken and every single one of their dishes were excellent. For appetizers we had the Artichoke dip and the Jerk Shrimp, again both delicious.  
So the next time you're in Vegas, get out of your fancy hotel and treat yourself out to something different and worth your money!"}
{"text":"We went to Bahama Breeze again last night...This makes about 7-8 times now.  They do not disappoint. Service was great and so was the meal."}
{"text":"This place is very cute, yes. But the food is whatev. Service could definitely be better. And I don't understand why they call themselves Caribbean..they serve Olive Garden food (plus a little more seafood.)

Nonetheless, I ordered the shrimp linguine..and it was ok. A bit on the salty side and the pasta was just a little overcooked. The boyfriend ordered the pork tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes. Potatoes were delicious..pork, not so much. It was very dry and didn't have enough flavor.

Anyway, this is a great place for big groups..if you have money that is. Expect to pay $30 a person..and more if you're drinking."}
{"text":"This is formula fast food with a menu you look down at and pay too much for. Almost not worth writing a review, The Special Jerk Chicken is not even close to being a jerk. The mashed potatoes were beaten into a sticky gooey glue-like mess. The wife asked for Jerk-style ribs and got what the waiter said was a mango based jerk sauce. The Onion Rings were rock-hard tasteless hoops and the chicken wings were over-done and leather like. The high noise level made for difficult conversation. However the margarita was over-the-top and presented well. Go for the drinks and skip the food."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Stopped by with friends for lunch. 
The building is huge inside with a cool water feature as you enter. Two bars to choose from.
I ordered the Cuban. it was great. Tho I can't really recall much detail because I forgot to review right after I ate there and it's now like two months ago. BUT ! I can say we all enjoyed our meals and the customer service was great. 
I recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour, apps, drinks and beer are cheap, they got some great food too and I love this place, they have a few sides for a patio with palm trees all around to give you the island feel lol"}
{"text":"I love Bahama Breeze and sad that there isn't a California location. I am a big fan of their pan seared salmon pasta, however I learned it's been discontinued from their menu for years now :( (I was lucky last pregnancy, supposedly they still had the ingredients to make it when it was already discontinued) I'm very bummed because I drove from California just to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. I ordered their jerk chicken pasta instead which used to be my old favorite and it's still delicious. I told my family I probably won't be crazy about Bahama Breeze anymore since my favorite dish is no longer served. But..! my brother had ordered their Steak Oscar and I had a teeny bite and oh my! It was super yummy! There I was, sucked back in. Guess I will have to come back after I pop out this baby. Steak was topped off with crab meat in a creamy sauce and had such great flavors. Out of all our dishes that night, the steak was probably the best one ordered. My family really enjoyed their Long Island iced tea and I had their virgin pina colada which they are known for. My sister in law and I were also very impressed by their kids portion. We had ordered bow tie pasta for our kids and the portions were very generous for such a good reasonable price. 

Also, I didn't order their haberno wings this time as I get major heartburn with pregnancy. But their haberno wings are always a hit!"}
{"text":"Can you believe this was my first time here after living in Vegas almost 20 years?! This is one of my new favorite places! When we walked in I felt like I was on an island getaway. We were greeted by 3 very friendly staff members who escorted us to our table and introduced us to our server Deja who was the sweetest! She welcomed us and gave us their daily specials as well as made some recommendations when we weren't sure what to order. I love the atmosphere here it makes you so relaxed and they have the best selection of tropical vacation drinks, you know the kind with the little umbrellas haha. Our food came out lightning fast! Our appetizer was the Breeze Cheese Bites which are crisp fried yuca stuffed with melted cheese and cilantro crema dipping sauce. It was ok, to be honest it wasn't something I would order again because the \"melted cheese\" wasn't melted it was just a stick of cheese inside a fried yuca ball. For my entree I ordered the coconut shrimp tacos (2) and Deja recommended the fresh fruit with sorbet for my side which was amazing! The fish tacos were good but they were really spicy! I know it came with sriracha aioli but wow they were hotter than expected. The coconut shrimp had good flavor and the size was good too. The tortillas were cold and kind of hard. Ill come back because of the excellent service but order something else next time. This would be a great place to come with a group of friends they have a pretty big selection of food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food and also nice inside. My super picky family left raving about how delicious and fresh everything was. On top of it all, the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Dont waste time coming here!!!Service here is horrible!!! There were 5 people at front but everyone was confuse where to seat us. No communication..wasted 15 min. Was seated and very unhappy server after 20 min walks to us and ask us for our order. Our server had no sense of personality. First time experience a very horrible . For sure not coming back! Have to mark as one star since its not letting post the review"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to come and spend some time with the wife is love how thay decorated the whole place to have a tropical theme along with the live music makes it that much better  there happy hour is the best thay have so much to choose from and the drinks and food are amazing  today my waiter was amon he was always making sure my cup  was always full great customer service is love everything about  Bahama breeze"}
{"text":"Don't go here for Lunch. Slowwww service. I did not get enough to eat, as the portions were very spare. Server was arrogant, and condesceding towards me, I don't know why. Perhaps because I had to ask her to keep repeating what she was saying, she had such a thick accent. Almost as she just got over here today! Wish I had an \"American\" server as this would have made my dining experience better! Don't bother eating Lunch here, PASS IT BY."}
{"text":"Since I'm a huge lover of island cusine this is my go to place, not only do they have the best happy hour menu in town they have awesome drinks one in particular the Bahama Rita, reasonable price decent size and great on taste.
 I've dined here on many occasions, always pleased with my visit but tonight a group of coworkers and I decided to stop in for a late meal and we were served by a server named \"Tina\" not only did Tina give us awesome customer service she made us feel welcomed, she was patient, and had an outgoing sense of humor definitely one of the best visits I've had. 
With that being said if your ever in the mood for an awesome drink and meal at a reasonable price stop by during happy hour and ask for Tina I assure you, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks and yummy deserts - its like Olive Garden for the Island Fare."}
{"text":"We have been here many times because the food is so good, but this time the service outweighed the food. We went in the early evening and it was not crowded. It took 25 minutes before anyone came over to greet us, get drinks etc. after waiting 15 minutes and watching the servers repeatedly help other tables we went back up to the hostess to ask if there was a problem. Convinced that someone would come over after we requested service, which we should not have to do, we waiting another full 10-15 minutes. We were about to go to the red lobster up the street when we were finally greeted. We were so hungry from waiting for so long that we ordered everything we wanted right then. We didn't wanna lose the waiter after waiting so long. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. Assuming the appetizers would be delivered first. I think that how they work. Needless to say we the. Waited another 45 minutes only to be served our dinners, appetizers never came. I also ordered an $8 drink and it was delivered in a half size plastic cup. Ripped off. The waiter was only working with 1 other table. Only difference is we are white and his other table was 8 black women. He was also black and completely uninterested in helping us. Race probably had nothing to do with it but it sure felt like it did. When we were half way through the entrees, the dumpy manager brought over the tostadas, one of the appetizers we ordered. It wasn't made correctly, did not have any meat as described, and he said he would take care of the apps so we wouldn't have to pay. He seemed like a sociopath, emotionless. After our entrees were finished, the second appetizer arrived. We waited another 25 minutes after being finished before the waiter came over again. But don't worry, he was flirting with the 8top he had, assisted them and stood by their table relentlessly. The funny thing is we had a gift card so we were planning to leave a hefty tip. Waiting forever to be served, not getting the orders right, not bringing the food in the correct order, I felt so ripped off and backwards. I heard a different waiter going over specials with the table behind us which no one ever did with us and said out loud why couldn't we have had that guy. There were 5 bus boys walking around aimlessly. It wasn't crowded but it was the worst server experience I've ever had. It's a shame because the food is so good usually. I am making a prediction that this place is going to continue to go downhill."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying bahama breeze after passing it quite a few times. I saw that they have happy hour and was finally able to go with my sister and her BF. 

Lots of parking and a really great environment with live music. We weren't in the main dining room, but we were in the room with the live music and beachy feel which was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Our server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.

Lobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.

Coconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish. 

Seared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either. 

Habanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO. 

I had been wanting a frozen bahamarita all day and it did not disappoint me. I'm pretty sensitive to alcohol and yes... I'm one of THOSE people who get super red after half a shot but I managed to finish my entire drink without getting tomato red. Drinks here seem to be watered down because I also tried my sisters classic margarita and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it! I loved it but she did not. 

The next I come back, I'll be ordering their seared ahi tuna again and I'll be trying their empanadas"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Half priced apps and good deals on drinks. The firecracker shrimp app is delicious, and the service is always good.  The GM, Victoria, is the bomb!!! ;)"}
{"text":"What a delightful dinner experience at the Bahama breeze. I like the fact that they have full meals and a lighter option."}
{"text":"Great food and very flavorful ! Pleasant atmosphere with cool decor. Great selections on cocktails especially mojitos"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Food is good my favorite thing on the menu are the Jamaican jerk chicken wings. They have so much flavor! The drinks are great and the servers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Love love & love! Welcome to the Bahama Breeze where you are transported to an island and served cocktails out of pineapples. The building is beautiful. Quick tip If it's a beautiful day outside ask to sit on the patio! My server I forget her name but she's the lady with the braids wrapped up, I love her! I have had her as my server about three times and she really is the sweetest thing in the world. She makes this place feel even more cozy! This place also has a really good happy hour! If you're lucky you'll get to see live entertainment! I always get the tacos, fish or coconut shrimp. Get the firecracker shrimp ! Don't get me started on the drinks. I love the Bahama mama, the pain killer and the ultimate pineapple! You will feel like you're not even in Las Vegas but instead a tropical get away. Definitely head here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on a Thursday and loved it! The food and drinks were great along with the service."}
{"text":"Amber was my server, and she was very friendly.....I ordered a white sangria which was probably good sans so much ice.
For my entree I ordered their Chipotle Chicken Taco Salad, I like it but it's pretty basic......My item to order over and over again is their version of Conch Fritters (with a delicious citrus mustard sauce), Yummy!"}
{"text":"The live music made the night! I had the jerk chicken pasta with a pitcher of mango Margarita, everything was excellent. The service was fast and very helpful, I have nothing bad to say. Perfect Sunday dinner if you are looking for something different and decently priced."}
{"text":"do not get the non alcoholic Bahama mama! nothing really special here. maybe there happy hour is better. I got the cilantro cream chicken and an order of onion rings. the onion rings were better than the entree. it was an \"OK\" meal. I had high hopes for this place. even my waiter was rude. but the interior is clean and so are the bathrooms. that's a plus. I wouldn't come here again though. I rather go to cesars buffet."}
{"text":"Late Happy Hour around the fire with apps was just what we needed after a long day of travel, sight seeing and shows. The service was FANTASTIC, the appetizers excellent and the drinks strong. It was a spur of the moment choice that I am happy we made."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  It had a great atmosphere and a good vibe.  We went here because it had a claim that it was \"Gluten Free.\" Something I have to look for because of my wheat allergy so I was excited.

They didn't have a special GF menu which is not a big deal to me because typically the waiter will just fill me in or make his recommendations.  This waiter didn't know much about what foods or sauces had flour.  He didn't really have any enthusiasm to find out and come back and make some recommendations. So I had to McGyver my own meal which typically means I have to eliminate the sauces. I tip very well when waiters really know the foods and can make recommendations or atleast have the eagerness to find out for me. I don't typically eat out and this was going to be a real treat for me.

I ordered scallops in butter sauce and the scallops were burnt and then raw in the middle. When I sent them back, they replaced only the one I ate half of.  I asked for a dinner salad instead and they gave it to me with croutons.  He took it back and picked off the croutons as crumbles were still there. What part of \"I can't eat flour don't you understand?\"  

I sent back the salad and refused to eat as I swore someone would have spit in my food by now.  And let me tell you, I'm a very passive person when it comes to any problems with my food.  So I wasn't mad or anything and I didn't give the waiter any attitude. By the way, the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned.

There was a huge two parties going on and every staff member kept coming in and out the patio doors fussying over the parties and most people seated were ignored and were very openly upset about the service by stopping random staff members for drink refills and to check on their food.  I was with two other people who swore it tasted nice but I don't know if they were just being polite as literally \"utter chaos\" was going on around us and we waited 45 minutes for our table when we called in advance for a reservation.

I was treating my friends so I was shocked that I was given a \"$10.00 charge\" for food that was returned!  I hadn't eaten anything sat and drank myself silly over the ice tea and left more hungry than I came in.  There was absolutely no apology anywhere or from anyone and I couldn't believe the waiter was serious about this charge. So I didn't tip him.  Probably the first time in a really really long time that I haven't tipped a waiter.  Still feeling a bit guilty over it but it was a very bad experience and it wasn't me that night it was everyone else around us too."}
{"text":"You can't beat their late night happy hour!  My friends and I have become regulars.  So good and super cheap!  Nice easy going atmosphere.  The service is pretty slow.  That is the one drawback."}
{"text":"Came here for their happy hour after work on an extremely hot day since they have frozen drinks! Definitely an extensive tropical drink menu which I can definitely appreciate. The passion fruit mango white sangria is awesome! Definitely recommend that! The chicken quesadilla was a bit much for me, but still okay. BUT the beef empanadas were AMAZING! Definitely an interesting crowd depending on what you're looking for. One of the bartenders we had-Jason- was awesome! Super personable and great service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Bahama Breeze location a handful of times now, and I can't say I've ever been particularly wowed by this place. I do like the concept of this restaurant though, the island theme and the inspired menu. One thing I can say is that they have really good drinks! But, the food is mediocre and same with the service. About half of the workers seem to probably be still in high school, so don't expect too much service-wise.

They have a nice bar, so a good idea would be to just get some drinks a couple of appetizers. If you're vegetarian, there's really not a lot of options, but they have recently added Jackfruit tacos to the menu. Pretty interesting, but the guacamole that came with mine was way too garlicky and brown! One thing really good I had here was the grilled salmon salad. Definitely recommend it!

Overall, this is just another restaurant with a theme to me. Don't come here expecting too much of an experience."}
{"text":"Love the environment ! Reminds me of islands in California, except much larger with high ceiling and open space."}
{"text":"Want to have FUN? This is THE PLACE in Las Vegas! Great food, atmosphere, and DRINKS! Yum! Pictures tell in all. But you have to experience it to really appreciate how good it really is! Live music on Friday & Saturday's. Great Caribbean background music the rest of the time."}
{"text":"This place has always been a joy to eat at! My favorite dish is the Chicken & Cilantro cream 'a and the best appetizer to choose would be the full order of the Tower Onion Rings! Yum! On this visit they weren't that great :-/ I mean for $9.79 they could have been a hell of a lot better, were basically on the verge of being burnt! Any who the main dishes of the Coconut Shrimp and Chicken dish were amazing! The customer service was just OK this time. Idk they are slippin' just a tad. I will give them another try in a few months from now. Hopefully this was just a fluke!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas, and the first restaurant, and one of the BEST restaurants we attended while on trip. I kept it simple and ordered the quesadillas, my friend had the shrimp which were big and a generous amount. The food was good and flavorful, BUT the drinks were AMAZINGGGGG!! I'm really into the fruity-tooty, frozen and mixed type drinks, and their menu had plenty of options that were right up my alley. Loved it so much, we made it our last stop before we boarded our rescheduled flight back home."}
{"text":"I am a frequent regular of Bahama Breeze and I love this place ! The staff is always so friendly and the food is amazing ! Feels like you are on an island. The coconut shrimp, the seafood chowder & the grilled chicken breast dinner are my favorites. Ask for Jarrod he is so sweet and a great server !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I love their drinks and the atmosphere is really comfortable. The service is great and very fast. However, I'm not a big fan of the food. I was okay, but not great. If you are looking for something off the strip for a quick meal, then this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Bahama Breeze in many years since they closed in Rochester. During that time, I used to frequent this restaurant on a fairly regular basis and really enjoyed the food and carribean theme. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Pittsburg still had the location open and was eager to give it a try.

We ordered Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp for an appetizer. It was spicy and delicious. The sauce and warm bread that it is served with is amazing. For our entrees, we had Baby Back Ribs and the Coconut Shrimp dinner. My husband loves the ribs! The meat was falling off the bone and he felt like they were some of the best ribs that he's ever had. He would definitely order these again. I had the coconut shrimp meal. I was really skeptical about ordering the coconut shrimp, but went ahead and gave it a try. I'm glad that I did because it was phenomenal. It wasn't overly sweet like others places serve their coconut shrimp. The only down side was that the rice was extremely dry and hardened. We ordered a cocktail too. They have a very large variety from which to choose. 

Service was good. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"People hate on bahama breeze..but if you read my review of the popular West Philly American Caribbean restaurant 48th Street Grill, I called it \"the hood jamaican foods suburban cousin\". Bahama breeze would be the uncle who got a little money, moved to the burbs, and bbqs at all the family cookouts.

Bahama Breeze been around forever. The service is at sometimes shaky depending which one you go to but overall it's always a nice experience. 
This current one in Beachwood Ohio has very fast service compared to the philly one. Sorry philly, not sorry. 

I always order the jerk chicken sandwich that comes with a slightly spicy but very good jerk based sauce. The fries are pretty good too, but this place is known for the drinks. Yes bahama breeze is not light on the alcohol and 3-4 drinks will have you thinking you left your underwear there, only to realize you never wore any there in the first place....okay back to the review..

If you don't feel like hearing kids yell, you should probably sit at or near the bar. 
Your experience will be what you make of it....now where did I leave my underwear??"}
{"text":"This place is like a high end Applebees and trust me your wallet will feel it the day after, food was really good service was fast and I feel good there. One complain was the waiting time to be seated probably half an hour another will be that our appetizers arrived at the same time everything else but good thing was we did not have to pay for it which is the right thing to do for management when they screw up nice touch there and probably the reason for the four star rating."}
{"text":"I liked this place. The decor was nice, reminded me of elephant bar for some reason.

We got the coconut shrimp for our appetizer. Good size shrimp with a delicious sauce. A hit of sweetness and a hint of mustard. I'm not fond of mustard but this was an awesome dipping sauce. Truly enhanced the shrimp. 

For dinner, I ordered the lobster/shrimp linguini. Decent amount of lobster but a crapload of shrimp! Every bite had shrimp and that was well worth the 20 dollars! The sauce had the right amount of creaminess to it which was a plus! 

Yes, I'd go here again. YES YES YES. Especially for the coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure about this place. I might have to go back and try again. But here's what I am sure about. 

Service - very good, the redeemer of this place. 

Drinks - all of their signature cocktails were just sugar bombs with not of lot of depth. Cheap tasting stuff. 

Food - I got the coconut fried shrimp as a appetizer, and it was really tasty and well done. I ordered the fruit and chicken Caribbean salad and it was ok. The chicken was of the same quality you get in those giant frozen bags at Sams club, and it was just gross, it really felt like fake chicken, like they boiled it, idk. Don't order any of their chicken dishes. The salad was overdressed but was yummy at first. It's a very pretty dish. 

Someone at my table got key lime pie and really like it. 

The prices here are reasonable, if you don't expect above Chili's level cuisine. I will go here again and update this review after trying more of their \"signature\" dishes. 2 stars for now."}
{"text":"Food is great but customer service is terrible here. I am regular customer and call in phone orders weekly. This week I tried to pay over the phone with my card because I left my purse at the office, and they refused to take payment this way. I have done in the past regularly but Dan the general manager says they no longer take credit cards via phone- which apparently changed from the week before. When I told them I was a regular customer and this has never been issue before Dan didn't have the courtesy to come out from back to speak to me in person. When they took my payment because I had my assistant bring my purse they didn't even look at ID- Hello what's the difference? Although I like there food not sure I would go back since experience was so bad."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! The food was great and the service was even better! Thanks Tamika!!! You made our dinner a great experience!!"}
{"text":"So we were looking for a place to eat Caribbean food at Vegas and found this place... Just out of this world!!! The food, the ambient, everything is amazing!!! You have to try the coconut shrimp, margaritas, and mojitos. I had the Carnitas rice bowl, it is a blend of all caribbean flavors... A party in your mouth!!! At the end we had the banana nut bread dessert, it is amazing!!! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even live in Vegas but every time I'm here I have to hit this place for Mojito's!! its a great place to have happy hour before heading out for Dinner... I haven't eaten there.. I only get Drinks.... shots of tequilla and mojito's  ( a deadly combo i know ) ... maybe next time I'll actually try the food.."}

{"text":"First time here! Our waiter Jerry was awesome! He can tell you about every item and drink on the menu! I had empanadas as a starter, followed by jerk chicken pasta and a Caesar salad. Also there drinks are so good and happy hour is from 9pm to close!"}
{"text":"We had taken a drive to get to know the area and to wander for an early dinner. We found Bahama Breeze and after a warm welcome, a peek at the menu and a 3 minute wait we were seated and ready to go.
Christine B. Gave a great fun evening- humor, promptness, very helpful explanations about the meals and drinks.
I had the mango caipirosca drink with vodka and mango, the sriracha fish tacos with tomato salad ( light meal so I can protect my dear spouse from anentire key lime pie slice) and he had a great shrimp rice bowl. Delicious!!! Big portions.
The pie was excellent and almost tart enough to be killer- with a perfect crust.
The service was individualized and professional.
You know if my tough reviewer husband wants to come back, this was seriously very good!!
I have my next assignment: stuffed plantain with crab on top!!
One tip for management: we were both stunned to see that waitresses must bus their own tables. Now the plates and bowls here are large and very heavy stoneware. This is wear and tear on your very important team. We are hopeful that our concerns reach the ears of big cheeses. Maybe an undercover boss is needed- I can see no CEO working anywhere near as hard as did the staff tonight.
Docking one CEO a star for a really dumb move."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited this location on a Tuesday evening about 5p. The happy hour offerings were nice for appetizers, but i can't speak on drink options. They had no draft beers on tap. The restaurant was clean and quiet, which is something we both appreciated. Although we could overhear a couple complain about their meal (apparently not enough flats in their wing order), but management seemed to take care of it and them. The food service was on time and all the food was tasty. The jerk wings were not my favorite, tasted too much like fried, crispy turkey. The coconut shrimp were not impressive, but tasty. I rather enjoyed the Jerk Chicken Pasta. I would visit again."}
{"text":"This place to me is like gold in a pile of rubble. 
I always pass this place and never thought of going in, however my sister dragged me here and I'm glad she did!
The architecture is nicely done and reflects buildings found in tropical areas so well that i felt like i was back in Hawaii. 

There is also a water feature that is in the center of the restaurant, and a bridge takes you over it to the various dining places. 

We came during happy hour and got a the lobster shrimp quesadillas, skillet simmered jerk shrimp, fried chicken sliders, ultimate pina colada, and a frozen bahamarita.

I was really disappointed in the Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp and felt a little steered wrong by the menu. I was expecting it to have a lot of seasoning and flavor, however it was just normal shrimp scampi. The lobster shrimp and fried chicken sliders were amazing though and made up for the shrimp scampi."}
{"text":"First time here my first experience was not so bad the food was great the service was decent and the price was a little out my budget but it was to be expected hey we're in Vegas gotta live it up!!!! #heyyyyy  I had a mudslide yummy yummy yummylicious lol #heyyyyy #turnup #girlsweekendout #05242014"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and it smells dirty. The bartenders aren't very friendly nor do they seem motivated to serve people. Like right now my glass has been empty to almost 10 mins while one of them \"cleans the liquor bottles\". Meanwhile he should be cleaning the menus because the pages stick together!"}
{"text":"Amazing quesadillas!!!!  The shrimp and lobster quesadillas are to die for.  Service was excellent today.  Of course the margaritas are outstanding and three of us had lunch for a really great price."}
{"text":"the service was good at the bar and the waiter was helpful through a lot of questions by the group. I had the crab and avocado salad. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. very fresh, great option for a menu. it was a bit on the pricey side for the portion, but I wouldn't want the quality to be any less. the pumpkin seeds were a great add to the dish. everyone's food looked appetizing in the group and the drinks were also enjoyed by those having alcohol. we also had one person order the jalapeño mojito and the spice was overpowering. they did the right thing and took it back, making a new drink."}
{"text":"Good food, hoppin' atmosphere. Good tropical drinks.  Service a little slow."}
{"text":"Food is a 5 star but the service needs improvement.... The majority of servers seemed like they never served before. It's a shame a restaurant like this is tainted by bad service. Get them some training. Other than that, I loved the food."}
{"text":"Went there for a drink during happy hour and sat at the bar.  We ordered 1/2 price apps and $5 margaritas until we couldn't possibly eat any more.  The portions were huge.  I will say the Margaritas and mojitos were a tad on the strong side, but I prefer them that way.  The bartenders were fun and the atmosphere overall was easy going and fun.  It's the kind of place that melts the stress away."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Saturday (2/21) night because everything else had a long wait list. We waited for about 10 minutes before getting a table. Which isn't bad for a weekend. It took the waiter about 15 minutes to get to our table then 15 more minutes to come back with waters. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It was pretty decent. For our entrees we both ordered steaks. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Frittes and I ordered the Steak Churrasco. Our horrible HORRIBLE waiter completely forgot about our food so by the time it got to us it was completely cold. My rice was overcooked and the other sides were missing from the plate. My boyfriend's fries were completely rock hard and under seasoned. The worse part was the meat. They serve the lowest grade beef possible. Tasted like re-hydrated beef jerky. Our waiter once again disappeared for 30 minutes. I couldnt even finish my meal it was so disgusting. This may have been a direct result of having a bad service. The food may have been good if it were fresh from the kitchen. Maybe I will try again on a different and shift."}
{"text":"I love Bahama breeze. Anytime I'm in a city where there's a Bahama breeze, I go. I've always had great experiences at the locations I've visited, but that ended tonight. The 6100 Robinson Center Dr in Pittsburgh is the absolute worst location I've ever been to. I was disappointed in the flavor lapse in the food, the service was subpar, and the manager rushed us out into the cold with 48mins left until closing. No wonder this is the emptiest location I've ever seen. It's awful."}
{"text":"If Gilligan's Island had furniture, cushions, umbrella drinks, and served food, they may just call it Bahama Breeze.

I am not a big fan of chain restaurants - I am a \"buy local\" type of guy but the food was really well done.

I purchased the firecracker shrimp and a salad (with fruit, grilled chicken, etc.. - I forget the name but it really was because of the bliss due to the mixture of chicken, cheese, fruit, dressing, etc...)

Atmosphere - at first I was worried that i walked in to a Red Hat Society meeting because the median age was 62 years old but quickly realized the folks there just know good food.    It was great

Price - the appetizers are $5-12 depending on what you get.   The entree My salad had a crazy price - $10.69 - I am not sure why it was $10.69 - I made sure to add $0.31 to the tip just so I could continue my rounding.   The prices were good but they did try to increase my math difficutly.

Food - The firecracker shrimp was just a tad over cooked but still had explosive flavor.   The salad rocked and I was able to save my calories that evening for some high octane beer in Sewickly.

I will definitely go there again.   If you have not been you are just missing out ;-)"}
{"text":"Good food here and also I really love drinks here to and The Restaurant design look like garden that make you enjoy and relaxing here. And so many parking at the front of restaurant too."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time....place was pretty busy but not a long wait, drinks were good, food was overall good with a reasonable wait time and staff was nice and responsive.  Looking forward to trying out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour specials! Plus they start at 9pm which is earlier than most places in town. 

The appetizers were all really good and the selection of drinks is pretty extensive. 

My only complaint would be the drinks are more sugary than strong. I need a little more liquor! But I still come here pretty often. 

I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Ahhhh their happy hour is amazing!!! My boyfriend and I usually go for the late night happy hour because it starts at 9pm Sun-Fri. The app specials are delicious and the drink specials are great. We're both able to get pretty drunk for under $50. I also love how the place looks. It has a very tropical theme!"}
{"text":"Came here for my mother's birthday. We all regret it, especially mom. Mostly because the extremely slow and at times irritating service. Our waitress was obviously not having a good day, and she made sure we knew it with constant eye rolls and poor excuses for the delays. The drinks we ordered took forever to arrive, and after being there for 2 hours, I only managed to order 2 drinks. I would've happily had another but service left me without a drink for about a 45 minute increment. Spent over $100, wasn't treated like it however. The food was ok, but not worth the subpar service. Will not return."}
{"text":"Jerk wing and lobster quesadillas is a must always hot and fresh.Waiter was friendly and service was quick"}
{"text":"This place thinks it's straight out of Florida. In the summer its probably amazing to sit on one of the decks with the windows open and drink your favorite fruity drink. 

The day we went it wasn't busy, the room was cold, the food was eh and the live band- well they were so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. 

I think it's worth a second visit, when it's warm outside. 

Seems like a good social place for groups, not for \"romantic dates or a nice dinner for a couple\"."}
{"text":"This place is great for when you want passable food and delicious, sugary cocktails.

It is always packed, but they take open table reservations which is good.

I had the mahi mahi and it was completely unremarkable.  It wasn't bad, the stand out was the pineapple salsa that came on top of it, but the best part of dinner was my pineapple coconut martini.  It was delicious.

My friend and the cobb salad and it also looked okay.  Everything about Bahama Breeze is okay, but it's just okay.  There are obviously many better options in Robinson, but this is not the worst option.

It's just...okay!"}
{"text":"We go here a couple times per month and we love their Red beer. Great happy hour prices on drinks. They need to update their menu. Food for happy hour is just so so. Staff is nice but hostess' good use some training. Nice patio when its not too hot to sit outside. They have a great Caribbean theme but needs some updating."}
{"text":"While service and the waiter were very friendly and helpful the food was subpar. We just came from the islands and I have to say Bahama Breeze was a total fail. They fried and breaded my wife's lobster and my shrimp  was not very fresh I hardly could even taste the coconut it was stale or old. While the please has the Island vibes it fails to deliver on the food . Sure presentation is well thought but flavor leave a lot to be desired. It's just not comparable."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean food. Loved their rice chicken bowl. However, I didn't like thier Mango Jalapeno Mojito. I find it too spicy."}
{"text":"Very nice place. very delicious food. but no traditional cuisine. This is a common food for Americans. Fried shrimp...., it's too simple American menu. the Cuban menu or the Caribbean. This kitchen has a different meal choices. But if you're not a gourmet Caribbean cuisine. This restaurant quite a come down."}
{"text":"The menu is good for a lovely lunch. I believe you will enjoy the appetizers in place of your main meal. We really enjoy the seafood served here. Grilled jerk shrimp skillet is amazing!!! Also, my appetizer was a crab meat atop of shrimp tower and avocado and pineapple. The picture shows a tower up on a red spicy sauce that is really hot,but works great with the pineapple and avocado. Enjoy!!  Sometimes a group of servers can get you that five star rating. This group is almost there, but don't be sad if you are not dazzled by the service (just B- on service)."}
{"text":"As unforgiving a place for people of color as I have ever encountered. The wait staff was outwardly nasty and insisted I pay in advance for my order. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Carribean TREASURE! Love love this place. We always start with the Fire-Roasted Jerk Shrimp... AAMAZING! It has all the perfect ingredients you can taste. The shrimps are sitting in a pool of this tangy buttery sauce- garlic, tomatoes,thyme.. the sauce is so great you want to drink it but don't go for the spoon just yet, they bring out this warm cuban bread for dunking!... mmm!

Another favorite is the Jamaican Grilled Wings, they are slow roasted to get the skin crispy, but once you bite into them you will taste the tender chicken they pair them with spicy jerk sauce (which you will most likely want your own for dunking)

Drink favorite- Frozen Bahamarita! sweet, tangy and freshing.

This is a must try when in VEGAS! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a BB. Food was okay but I think under par for the price the demand. The best thing we had were the Beef Empanadas. otherwise, it was just Meh. Would I go back? Yes, if I was given a gift card. Otherwise, there are too many other great places in Vegas for a lower price point that deliver better food."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars for their drinks and appetizers. Every hot dish we ordered came to the table at room temperature, at best. The only item that arrived hot was the empanadas. We also ordered the stuffed plantain and it was super salty. Sadly we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Okay food. Nice drinks. I was rather underwhelmed by the bland food, considering it is a caribbean restaurant, and should have had at least some spice, it almost feels like they watered it down for the midwestern palate, because it didn't really taste like anything different.

The servers are friendly but don't show up too often, and the presentation (or whatever you call it when the dressing only coats half your salad and food is sloshed around on the plate) is somewhat lacking.

I may go back, to give it a second chance, and also because it's the closest thing to Kaya (a super excellent caribbean restaurnant in the strip in pittsburgh that i miss and would almost drive 2.5 hours just to visit)."}
{"text":"Eh the place is alright nothing to exciting . I had some jerk wings and I was expecting more spice to them and got nothing it was pretty disappointing . Drinks where okay . I was surprised that had a dark beer as a happy hour . The only good thing was our server Randy was amazing very knowledgeable . If I ever come back I'll  come back because of Randy ."}
{"text":"Family atmosphere. The food was amazing. The customer service was impeccable. I can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"When on the fence as a rating for lunch, after much deliberation I am using a 3.. Pros and Cons... apps had two chips salsa and empenadas. Salsa on point as well as empenadas main course was a letdown. Jerk chicken left me wanting but not in a good way.  I wanted something else... Shrimp and lobster quesadillas can lay off all the spinach or rename it ....Jerk Chicken pasta should have been ordered without the asparagus... it gives and unwanted flavor...soups chicken tortilla and the bahamian seafood chowder needed some umph... now the firecracker shrimp adds back to the positives..all in all I was confused, was this a island themed or southwestern themed menu too many items take away from that island theme...I can Pass on a future visit..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the hostesses and waitstaff and bartenders were all very nice people. I ordered a margarita which was not very good and had to send it back. It had a very medicinal taste to it. I don't think was the bartender's fault because they have a margarita machine. Don't recommend it. Never, let me repeat never ever, order steak from this place. I ordered steak Oscar and the Quality of the steak was so poor, it almost tasted like liver. Also, parts of it was so chewy, I had to spit it out into my napkin. If you are going for the atmosphere, it's a fun place. But if you want quality food, choose someplace else."}
{"text":"Such a great place for happy hour. Ask for Taylor, she was the best! Jamaican chicken and firecracker shrimp"}
{"text":"We went there for a wedding rehearsal dinner. So from the top, it was a very large group. We were also very spread out. 
The building was laid out nice with nice decorations. Our table was pretty good. The bench cushions were  a little low for some of the older people in the group but our waitress was really nice and accommodating.  For such a large group, she did amazing. She got the orders right and was very attentive. 

I ordered the firecracker shrimp to start. It was so good. Seasoning was off the hook. Large serving for an appetizer. My beer was nice and cold also.  

I then ordered the fish tacos. I have been a little spoiled living in California I suppose. The tacos were okay. Not enough pop and flavor for me. I was looking for that citrus pop of freshness but it wasn't there. The tortillas were a little chewy. Food alone would have gotten them a three, but when you throw in the awesome service, you can't beat it. The waitress made a fresh pot of coffee for us and the DJ gave my daughter  a Bahama breeze pen.  Everyone loved their food and there were no complaints. Decent price for what you get. 
I would go back easily."}
{"text":"The seafood chowder has one of my favorite elements - conch! Reminds me of the Carribean. The ultimate pina colada is DELICIOUS but low on the alcohol content. Tasty nonetheless. 

Lots of food for not-that-much-money, compared to the rip-off food options on The Strip. Our waiter even itemized our menu for each person, so we could easily split the bill in our group. Awesome service, good food, definitely coming back here again with friends!"}
{"text":"A fun neat place to eat!  Had lunch here and found the food to be tasty and pleasing to the eye. 

Restaurant was clean and wait staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Restaurant atmosphere is light and fun. A good place to eat. We will be back on a future Trip."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and i came here for hapoy hour it was My first experience here and I loved it. I ordered the beef empanadas, jerk shrimp, firecracker shrimp, pork street tacos, chicken tostones .... I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOURS!! Overload $7 Key Lime Pie margarita is my favorite lol 

My boyfriend and I loved this place the first time we went and every other time after that. We just went yesterday and there was a 45 min wait. Probably the only downfall. But what can we expect if it's so good? We had an AWESOME A-1 server named Tamikah who came to check on us every chance she got! Never forgot to see how we were doing no matter how busy it was! We loved it! Will be continuous customer."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good drinks, good food, average service, chaotic kitchen. Our local Bahama Breeze closed several years ago so when we were in Las Vegas we dropped in. We love the ambiance, we loved the specialty drinks. We ordered our salad, entree, and desert. We waited about 30 minutes before they finally bought out the entree before the salad. I told them to take the entree back and start over by serving the salad first, then the entree, then the desert. While waiting for we started noticing that all the orders in our area of the restaurant were wrong. The servers were running around like keystone cops trying to correct everyone's orders. We finally got our food and it was delicious. However, they need to organize their kitchen."}
{"text":"We had the most wonderfuld experience we have ever had in our life.  We had a gentlemen in our party with severe food allergies.  We explained this to the manager Steve who personally supervised the cooks to make sure the food came out perfect!  The food was exceptional.  The hostess, manager, and waitress went above and beyond the call of duty to accompidate us.  We drove 1 1/2 to eat here and will do it over and over again.  More restaurants need to follow the way Bahama Breeze does business.  Well Done staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I don't frequent mega-chain restaurants. However, when we're looking for something clean, fresh and relatively quick Bahama Breeze never disappoints. Today our server Ariel was speedy, knowledgeable and very professional. I thought my mojito was a little on the sweet side but our lunch entrees were perfect. Also a major thank you to the hostess for not making me do your job for you!"}
{"text":"Lobster and shrimp pasta was the best pasta I have ever tasted.

The server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered several suggestions. Lemonade was best I have tasted. Portions were too much for me to eat. Enjoyed the rest of it in the morning in the hotel room. Overall awesome experience.  

I visit Vegas for all Mayweather fights so this place is definitely on my short list."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I get a craving for jerk chicken pasta, which leads me right back to Bahama Breeze, so I was pleased when my group decided to go there last night.  I've never been disappointed with that dish, so it's my go-to, but I've also had the Cuban sandwich, the tilapia entree, the habanero wings, the goat cheese appetizer and these haven't disappointed me either.  I can't say that Bahama Breeze is absolutely amazing, which is why it won't get 5 stars from me, but for a chain restaurant I am impressed with the consistent quality and service that I receive there.  If you are in Robinson and craving some island fare head to Bahama Breeze and you should not be disappointed.  Oh, I almost forgot, and this may be unique to the Bahama Breeze in Robinson, but any time I've gone they have a live musician playing  Caribbean style music, which adds to the background quite nicely."}
{"text":"The ribs were burnt but the music outside was cool.. The bartender was very nice. The place is very clean. I lost my id there but overall the place was okau"}
{"text":"I brought my husband here for a date and boy did we enjoy ourselves. The waitress was very very helpful and recommended some good ideas for us to try (it was our first time). The place was set up very nice and I love the little scenery they have inside and outside. The food was delicious and served in very generous amounts. I highly recommend you trying the Pineapple-Coconut Martini it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at happy hour except for one thing.  The waitress up sold the group into having our piña coladas in hallowed out pineapples.  But she failed to mention it cost $8 more.  Guess caveat emptor right???  But we all felt she should have mentioned the additional cost as we were ordering off the happy hour menu.  Other than that great service and ambiance the apps were all tasty the jerk chicken wings especially phenomenal"}
{"text":"First time that we have eaten at a Bahama Breeze.  My husband and I were traveling to Nashville and spent a night in Cleveland.  Since the restaurant was close to our hotel, we decided to eat there.

We were a bit skeptical since we knew that Bahama Breeze was a chain restaurant operated by the Darren Group.  However, we were pleasantly surprised but the high quality of the food and the freshness of the ingredients.  We liked it so much, that we returned on our way back home a week later."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a million times... finally decided to come in and check it out. Neat vibe. Great drinks and a wonderful happy hour! Had a frozen bahamita and an ultimate pina colada. Like the colada better. Bartender was Jesse and he was excellent... helped me maneuver through the menu. Very helpful!!! Tried the key lime pie and it was great. Also tried the jerk wings... interesting taste that finished wonderfully. I am a very picky Mac and Cheese guy... so that one did not ring my bell. Will definitely bring back friends and family when they are in town!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I will definitely recommend this place to everyone. The food was excellent and the waiter was great. My pina colada was one of the best I've ever had, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Walking into this place gives you a relax feeling of being on the beach. Customer service was real good from our server. Took a little long for our food to come out and it wasn't layered with Apps first then meal. Other than that service was solid. I had the Habanero wings and firecracker shrimp to start and both were delicious. Followed it with the Cuban Sandwich. The sandwich was good but tasted a bit bland for my taste. Once I asked for the extra mustard it was good. I would definitely come back when I am in Vegas. I do recommend you stop by and have try!!"}
{"text":"I can't even say how many times I've been here with family, co workers or my boyfriend. Honestly just amazing food with a lot of flavor. Best time to go is any time they have a happy hour that you can't wait to run off to. There special Bahama drink are delicious you will probably order 5 of them from how good they are. The fire shrimp are bomb. And lobster shrimp quesadilla are dam near filled with gooey deliciousness. You won't be sorry you came"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Vegas so whenever I come back to visit I have to come to this place. They need to open up a restaurant in Arizona. My favorite meal is from here and it's a must try, the salmon tostada. The portion is huge, the salmon is perfectly cooked, and the dressing is to die for. Another favorite is the habanero wings, you get a ton of wings since it's an appetizer and the sauce is sweet and spicy. The cocktails are great here and the happy hour deals are wonderful! The service is always great, everyone is so friendly we haven't had a bad server yet. My mom and I come at least every two weeks, sometimes once a week."}
{"text":"After getting a couple of kid free hours to get my son's birthday shopping done I needed a bite to eat. My man suggested Bahama Breeze because he was in the mood for fish. I was just hungry and didn't care so off we went. 

Joanna was our server and she was lovely. I would definitely give her 4 our of 5 stars. We started with the Coconut shrimp (which is my man's favorite). It was good but I don't love it like he does. Something about fried coconut flakes just doesn't do it for me...to each his own. I ordered the lobster/shrimp quesadilla with a bowl of the seafood chowder. My quesadilla was fine but nothing to write home about...it could have used some hot sauce. The soup, however, was phenomenal. It was like a crab/shrimp chowder with little fried shrimp on top. It was creamy, smooth, not too salty and hearty enough. It was rich so I couldn't finish it all. My man was a fan and took the rest home for a late night snack. 

Overall an A-OK experience. I will be back if I think about it."}
{"text":"Bar/drinks review only. Great happy hour prices. I like the Aruba Red (beer) which is only at Bahama Breeze. I haven't had the food in a long time just because I tend to opt for healthier choices at other places, and I can't remember it well enough to write any opinion on it. I love to stop here for a drink from time to time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent customer service.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped me make a great decision.  I enjoyed talking sports with him...even though he is a 49er fan...lol.  Thanks for a wonderful lunch experience!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty generic. There's nothing particularly bad about it but there is nothing great about it in any way. Generic food, not slow but not fast service, servers are \"ok\". I did not leave upset or anything but nothing here impressed me or wowed me enough to entice me into a return trip."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancé and had Anita as our waitress...she said was amazing! Funny, engaging, genuinely sweet and knowledgeable!
We tried her recommendations of the lobster quesadillas, jerk chicken pasta, fire cracker shrimp, shrimp and lobster linguini and the ultimate pineapple drink and needless to say when my fiancé and I need a break from La and find ourselves in Vegas we will definitely be back! If you find yourself at Bahama breeze ask for Anita, It'll enhance your experience."}
{"text":"With its close proximity to the university, my classmates and I often swing by for their happy hour that goes from 4-6 pm. (Apparently there is also a reverse happy hour that happens 9-close!) We LOVE it.

With its tropical, breezy, just-sitting-out-on-the-veranda ambience, their specialty drinks are matched to boot. We usually indulge in these $4 perfectly garnished and charming cocktails. Ultimate Pina Colada, Bahamarita, Mojito Cubano, Pineapple Coconut Martini. (I've tried them all except the sangria and margarita on the rocks.) They're so pretty that you'll want to bust out your phone and be that person at the table. You know, *that* person.

If this doesn't suit your fancy, they also offer select beers for $2-$3, wines $2 off, and the standard mixed spirits for $3. 

Appetizers are half-off and are consistent with the quality of their drinks - flavorful, garnished appropriately, infused and influenced with its caribbean namesake. They offer a wide variety, so all mouths are sure to find something to pique their taste buds. The coconut shrimp seems to be a popular choice, but I recommend the beef empanadas, which is what I ordered on a recent visit. 

Round up your friends, relax and take a breather at \"Bahama Breeze.\" Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I am staying at the Residence Inn right behind this establishment.  My roommate and I were hungry but did not want to venture off too far.  We went here and were blown away.  Not only was the service great, thanks to Luis and Jason behind the bar, but the food was AMAZING!  We got there at exactly 9 p.m. and that is when they begin their happy hour.  I had the jumbo crab lump and shrimp tacos, followed by a mojito.  The next evening, I returned.  I had three of their Aruba Red beer and that was delicious.  To eat, I had the jumbo lump crab and the empanadas.  I was not disappointed!  Great place, music, ambience...it has it all."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to three Bahama Breeze locations: Raleigh, Seattle, and Las Vegas. We  revisited the Las Vegas location yesterday. 

The first thing we order, directly after the drinks, is the beef empanadas. Just as they were at every other location, they are unmatched and delicious! We went at lunch time for the first time at any location hoping to get a variation on the menu. We were pleasantly surprised. We got the lobster quesadilla combo with a caesar salad. The caesar had slightly too much dressing incorporated into the salad, but the amount of lobster and shrimp packed into the quesadillas made up for that minor hiccup. Great food and atmosphere as usual. Special thanks to the host staff at the front who were very hospitable!"}
{"text":"Very good food selection and a very laid back atmosphere. Does give the feeling of being in the islands. Prices are in line for the casual atmosphere. The wait staff and hostess are very helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"LOVE the beachy island vibe here! Live reggae band on saturdays & they aren't just ok, they are amazing!!! The delicious cocktails are just 7.99! We got appetizers & salads, everything was yummy!"}
{"text":"Located a little south of the strip but a true hidden gem. The prices were reasonable. We went during lunch. The Cuban sandwich was delicious. The house salad was amazing. My sister recommends the beef empanadas. Coconut shrimp were cooked to perfection. The drinks...they were amazing. Very tropical and fruity and you cannot taste the alcohol. Indoor and patio seating. It was great to be able to enjoy the warm weather. This will be a place we definitely will be coming back to and sharing with our friends."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out with the family ... Especially if I'm picking up the tab! The place makes you feel like you've escaped to the Caribbean.
Cool thing is they have live reggae music at night."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere but our server wasnt the best at her job. She kept looking at me and asking for my id and my husband had it our drinks were good but took forever food was was excellant ill go back but would like another server who loves her job"}
{"text":"This Caribbean restaurant has been a staple at the corner of Flamingo and Paradise forever it seems.  They consistently serve good food.  I really like their jerk chicken pasta and their seafood paella.  But this time, I decided to try something different and ordered their avocado and crab meat salad.  It was so good!  All the ingredients in the salad was very fresh and I got a whole avocado with this salad. They serve the avocado cut in half for me to scoop out myself and mix with the lump crab meat.  This place is quite busy during their lunch hour rush.  Their happy hour between 4 pm to 6 pm rocks with half price appetizers and cheap drinks.  If you like chicken wings, try their Jamaican chicken wings.  Everything I have tried has been tastefully presented and very pleasing to the palate.  If you have never been here before, you must try this place out.  You won't be disappointed as a they have a wide selection of menu items to choose from.  Oh, did I mention their mojitos are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in town. Forget the overpriced restaurants on the strip. Just go there and enjoy food, drinks, and live music for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Had the half price appetizers, sliders, chicken, carnitas, korean beef tacos, empanadas, and one more I cannot recall, kinda of a shrimp mango thing.....Anyways they were all really good, def got out money worth pretty big portions that we had enough to take home. I gave them to my brother and he really liked them as well.

Didn't get to try any signature entrees, but based off of our appetizer sampling this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food, service, and prices were perfect! Lindsey was a great bartender. Only thing I didn't like here was the terrible shirts."}
{"text":"This food was beyond good. It took me to my happy place. It was so seasoned and moist. I will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since I moved here. I finally made it and I wasn't disappointed.
We started with the panko/coconut onion rings, they were really good. Not to greasy and the coconut flakes gave it a nice flavor.
I got the avocado and crab salad. Very very good. I ate every single bite!
No run for dessert, but my two drinks were sweet enough. They were a specialty drink, kinda like a pina colada but without being frozen, very good!
I definately will come back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a friend to celebrate National Margarita Day because they had a deal going on where you could get margaritas for $2.22 each. Devin, was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. We started out of course with a margarita and it tasted pretty good, but they weren't consistent tasting each time. The promotion price was deducted from our bill with no problem and I was glad since the drinks were just so-so. 

Grilled Chicken and Tropical Fruit Salad ($12.49) -  Pineapple, red grapes, strawberries and mandarin oranges with goat cheese crumbles, candied almonds and drizzled with Island vinaigrette and grilled chicken. When it came to the chicken I was disappointed because it's described at grilled and the picture of it on the menu shows chicken with grill marks, but mine appeared to be seared instead of grilled and had no flavor at all. The chicken lacking flavor honestly left my mind once I tasted the greens, fruits and dressing underneath because there was a good amount of it and it all melded very well together. Good portion for the price and I'd order it again even if the chicken doesn't live up.

Rebecca's Key Lime Pie ($6.99) - Handmade with a brown sugar crust and golden meringue. I've had this dessert before and it tasted just as good this last visit. It's my favorite on the menu and tastes just right. Love that crust.  

Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake ($6.99) - Warm chocolate cake with a chocolate molten center topped with caramelized pineapple and served with raspberry sauce and fresh Island fruit. The first bite tasted a bit like burnt chocolate, but once I got towards the center it was chocolate heaven. 

Inside was clean and they have plenty of dining space as well an outdoor patio. 

Happy Hour is Monday - Friday 4:00 PM - 6:00 P.M.

Late night Happy Hour is Sunday - Thursday 9:00 PM - Close."}
{"text":"This casual and slightly Caribbean-style restaurant has a menu of tacos, shrimp, quesadillas, wings, salads, rice, soups, burgers, chicken, fish, and desserts. One other reviewer here uses the word \"passable\" to describe this restaurant. I agree. It is not one of my favorite restaurants, but I could eat here occasionally if necessary."}
{"text":"Happy hour appetizers and drinks until 6pm 

Pork street taco appetizers were delicious.  Just enough food to be filling as an early dinner.  With happy hour pricing tacos were just $4."}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve. It was my first time here. The drinks were good and the little plastic lizards they put in them were cute and were the highlight of the night. 
I did not like the jerk chicken sandwich, the chicken was lukewarm, not seasoned well and not the jerk taste I was expecting. The bbq sauce was good. The black beans and yellow rice were good, but again, lukewarm. Everyone at my table said their food was only warm, not hot, so I guess our plates were sitting for a while before we got them. 
I would give this place one more try and try a different dish only because I did like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was great, and food was tastefully prepared and served timely.
Our server was Neil and he was very informative and attentive to our needs.  The drinks were great too."}
{"text":"You better get really drunk because the food is horrible.   This our 3rd and last try at this place. We ordered conch fritters.just ok.  Chicken empenadas that were wet inside and doughy..disgusting taste. Sent it back for chicken curry rice bowl.  It was a small amount overall with about 5 small chunks of chicken. .the flavor was so so but after biting into a piece of chicken fat,and gristle that did it.  My guest ordered mahi tacos..it was,and griffin thin sliver of dried fish..looked like jerky more than fish.  Tge visit before we had a chicken pasta dish that was like a parmesan soup...Truly a terrible cooking.  We had a gift card which had money on it after we paid the bill...we gave it to another table as we won't be going back.  That's how bad it was.  Being locals..they must be staying in biz off drinks and tourists."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hot flavorful food, great happy hour, and from the moment we walked in the staff made us feel welcome! Gerry our server hit the spot. He was attentive, and outgoing. Jerk wings and shrimp n grits are a must try!
Mojito and new Major Lazor cocktail had a great kick. Atmosphere is a lively island feel. Best bang for your buck! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour around 4:30pm on a Friday. My server Alexis was great! Very kind and friendly. I ordered the Frozen Bahamita and Jerk Chicken. Both were so good. I would highly recommend trying this place out when your in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The portions are so huge for a happy Hour menu and they are half off. The drinks are only $4.. I ordered the Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp -  large  shrimp in a garlic-thyme butter with warm Cuban bread for dipping. It was good and I wanted to get more but found out the portion was big enough for me. I had the frozen Bahamarita that has 
Cuervo Gold Tequila, strawberry, kiwi and mango ices. My friends liked their food too. Richard our server was great, very attentive and made sure we were good. The place has a tropical feel and very airy, spacious. It is great for parties and you get tables for happy hour menu, it's not only at the bar."}
{"text":"Good service... I went on a Sunday lunch date, the waitress greeted me by asking me if I would like to start with a pain killer (speciality drink)... my kind of greeting. I opted for a zombie..  it was good, Wasabi' zombie is still the best I've tasted.  Delicious lobster and shrimp linguine."}
{"text":"Service here used to be good. Now the service is just o.k. Food is par, neither great nor poor. Restrooms filthy. No manager interaction, just walking around. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is always 5star, but it was tonight.   Great top shelf marg for the price (especially in vegas) and excellently prepared salmon salad."}
{"text":"Nice place! Christine B was an amazing server. I will return. If you want to come for a nice casual dining experience with great drinks, you should come here. The food is served at a decent pace, it come out nice and fresh and they make sure to keep you satisfied. I loved my server and the food was great."}
{"text":"Caribbean-themed restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere. We all -- Mom, Dad, big kids, little kids -- all really like this food!

Some suggestions: Coconut Shrimp, Jerk Chicken Pasta, Grilled Steak Kabobs, Ribs with Guava BBQ sauce, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, Jerk salmon w/ mashed sweet potatoes 'n plantains... Mmmm...

Save room for the homemade Key Lime Pie or Pinacolada bread pudding!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this place SO many times and it disappoints every, single time! Slow service and even slower food. It's a great location for my co-workers and I, only a few minutes from work. The menu is fun and different but everything about the service consistently leaves us wanting more. Plus, seems like every time we choose here were late returning to work. Today, our server Michael, took forever for drinks. Food was an equally long wait. He never checked up on us after the meals finally did arrive (yes, our empty glasses meant we were still thirsty). Then he stood near our table while we all waited, credit cards ready, before I finally had to ask for the checks. Word of advice: don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is a fun place to eat!  We came here around 7p on NYE before we walked the strip.  I was surprised we were able to get a reservation for 10, but it seemed like 7p was a bit early.

The food is pretty good, and for the price you can't really beat it.  I know that Vegas has all sorts of buffets, but there is something somewhat sad about buffets; most people concentrate on eating.  The ambience is great despite the somewhat tacky props and decor.

I'd imagine I'd give this more of a 3.5, but since they were so accomodating about adding another table (to make 10 from 8) and since I had such a good time (it being NYE), why the heck not, 4 stars for everyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place, nice ambience, has live music playing on the outside patio. Love the Jamaican jerk wings. The Cuban sandwiches are amazing. Everything I've tried here so far was really good. Just wish this place wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"My family and I were staying in Vegas for the week and we decided to have my aunts birthday there. This place is hands down amazing! Great selection, cheap drinks and the best service I've had in years!!! The burgers, pasta, and banana supreme is Delicious.  Gerald and Tina were our waiter's. We will definitely be coming back. They also came out with writing on my aunts desert for her bday"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! It's definitely a throw back to the 90s when these big themed family restaurants were all the rage. Along with mom jeans.

For portions were massive! So definitely a good deal.
I got steak with plantains and beans. Flavors were great but my steak was kinda cold. My husband got a cream cilantro chicken dish that was absolutely yummy.

Dessert was molten chocolate cake with pineapple. It was good but nothing really outstanding about it.

They also offer happy hour and late happy hour. I'd recommend catching those. Their appetizer options are all half off which makes that lobster quesadilla only $7 yum!"}
{"text":"By far this has been one of our favorite places to eat and drink in Vegas.  We come to town about 3-4 times a year for a extended weekend, and Bahama Breeze has always been our most anticipated stops.
Something went astray this time.  I ordered my usual ( Cuban Black Bean Soup, and Jerk Chicken Wings), my wife ordered the Portabella Mushroom Burger.  When he explained it was a hamburger, with a mushroom on top, my wife requested just a \"burger\" made with the Portabella mushroom as the burger.  I guess the special request was just to complicated.  First she got a open faced bun with a mushroom and veggie mix on it.  She requested the same thing again, and this time it came out as she requested, at about the start of the second bite, a small black bug crawled out from under the lettuce and casually walked across the corner of her sandwitch.  We called the waiter, pointed out the intruder, and he promptly took it back.
He then asked us if we wanted any desert.  We didn't quite understand the question, so we said no.  He brought us our bill.  
We didn't understand.  My wife had had nothing to eat at this point.  We didn't ask for anything else we just thought he would replace her un-eaten sandwich. 
The manager did come over and apologize, and told us how sorry he was, but her sandwich was not replaced.  
As we were leaving, I told the hostess the story, she hailed the manager who apologized again, but didn't seem to understand when I explained that my wife was leaving your establishment Hungary.  People shouldn't leave a restaurant Hungary.  
Not sure if we will try again, just kinda sad that our favorite place, now has a scar."}
{"text":"Menu has changed.  Less Caribbean flavors, more mainstream.  Food well prepared, generous portions.  Good experience, but not as great as it once was"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite place to eat in the last five years but with the service tonight they kind of dropped the ball. I was with a large party of about 13 and the first thing I noticed when I opened the doors were how dirty the glass windows were. The appetizers came out pretty quickly but our entrees took too long. I had the shrimp and lobster linguini which was hearty and very good with also a snack of 3 onion rings which were quite tasty. Once we received our food my friends entree was barely warm and they replaced it with a piping hot plate, but they took so long to bring it. We also had to ask for a refill of water two times. Hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"I am trying to like this place but twice I am asked to wait 15 minutes for a table when the restaurant isn't busy and there's no one waiting in front of me. After waiting they tried to sit me in the large dining area where no one was sitting. I traveling for work and dining alone so I think they are trying to force me to eat at the bar. 

My first visit was mediocre. I ordered a beer which came to me in a bottle that a runner just dropped on the table and ran away. The beer was warm inside but the bottle was cold and the label was about ready to fall off. I guessed they tried to ice down  a room temperature beer. The waiter at least offered a glass for my beer.

I ordered the grilled chicken with cilantro cream. The chicken didn't have much taste since it seemed to be grilled then some bland glaze added on top. There was a bed of mash potatoes that was smothered in a  green 'cilantro' sauce which I liked but I'm a sucker for any thing smothered in gravy. 

So overall I would go back here but I don't expect great good. It's is reasonably price but nothing special.  If you go during happy hour you can make out like a bandit with half price apps and drinks for dinner. Happy hour is 9pm to midnight."}
{"text":"Had a retirement party for a friend, 20-25 people were there, they shoved us in a small room with the fire pit in the center, some ppl had to stand due to the lack of chairs and tables, the service was absolutely terrible, very slow, some ppl had to go to the bar for their own drinks. My drink was basically a slushy with shot of tequila on the side , I had to drink some of the slush in order to get the tequila to fit in the glass .. Knowing how many ppl were there they only had two servers and one bus boy .. You could tell the girls were over whelmed and it showed in their service and attitude.. Some of the appetizers were bland , such as the spinach artichoke like dip was extremely watery and had ZERO flavor, the smoked wings were tough , the only good thing were the coconut shrimp.. I use like eating there , but after this , I probably won't return .. Party or not !!"}
{"text":"I had the \"fresh fish\" salmon with mashed potatoes & asparagus. 

Was actually better than I expected, no fishy taste and the potatoes were very tasty. They should be with all the butter they add. 

Excellent meal if you're not looking for something heavy.


Now about the SERVICE. 

- We sat at the bar and were greeted with an obnoxious bartender. 
- When asking for water he just had to say \"so you just want good ole lake mead?\" Tackiest way to try and upsell. I wish he would try that at a fine dining establishment. 
- He tried to memorize our two simple order and of course he messed up. Use a pen and paper next time.
- forgot to put in our appetizer & never realized it.

The guy definitely had a few drinks before work. 

If I ever return I'll grab a table.

FYI I love lake mead water."}
{"text":"It's a fun hang-out, as long as your expectations are managed.  It's basically TGIFridays or Applebee's, but with a more exotic menu.  The service is hit or miss. But if you just want a bite after work and you are nearby, you could do worse.  Stick to the basics, and don't be too adventurous, and you'll be alright."}
{"text":"The staff is really polite (5 stars) and the food is OK (2 stars.) I went with 4 because food is more important. The drinks are good if you're looking for tropical stuff (duh.)"}
{"text":"We love this place! Food is always great, especially the shrimp firecracker, staff is friendly and the atmosphere makes you feel like you're not in Vegas anymore. Their alcoholic drinks are always awesome! I definitely recommend this spot especially lunch time on a Sunday afternoon! Just relaxing to sit in the patio with a drink in your hand and great food in front of you!"}
{"text":"Good vibes. Great food. Phenomenal service. Counch fritters x Reggae Punch for the win!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great happy hour menu! Perfect for 104 degree weather!!! Their bahamarita is the perfect frozen drink and their sangria get a two thumbs up!!!! Happy hour is the best time to come and get the best bang for your buck!! And the crowd is pretty great!"}
{"text":"BBQ ribs were pretty tasty.

Also the mens bathroom by the bar smelled like trix cereal. I was oddly satisfied."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and drinks here and the service was fast.  I ordered the firecracker shrimp and would suggest that to anyone."}
{"text":"Our friend, Richard Maurer, is one of the rotating house bands at this location.  He is a very talented musician who lives, eats, and breathes music.  His percussionist stylings on the steel drum are worth a listen!

We went to Bahama Breeze last Sunday to watch Richard play, and enjoy the company of friends and a tropical meal.  The menu had an interesting variety of offerings that all looked so pretty in the pictures!  My favorite bites were the fried yuca, tostones with chicken, my husband's empanadas, our dulce de leche cheesecake (big enough to share!), and their pineapple salsa.  Flavor-wise, the food wasn't anything to write home about, but it was novel.

The service and music were excellent."}
{"text":"For a Bahamian off strip restaurant we had a great lunch at Bahamas breeze . 

Service : Service was attentive and good . 

Food: we had a bunch of plates for two people. We started with the tostones which were great but very filling . We also tried the seafood chowder which was very good but very creamy . I had the shrimp and cheesy grist which were good and loaded with calories . We also added plantains and a side of beans . 

Drinks : drinks were amazing and one of the reason we will be back . We had the coconut mojito which was amazing and also a margarita which was pretty standard . 

Overall experience : The patio is a great place for a lunch and is enclosed to keep out the heat of the desert . We will definitely be back for a lunch in the future ."}
{"text":"Food was good, Beef empanadas were fabulous with the pineapple chutney. I like the Caribbean decor, makes me want a vacation away from this desert scenery."}
{"text":"Called in a to go order at 130 to be ready at 2. Got here at  215 and they were making it.  The coconut shrimp was tasty.  The tortilla soup had unappetizing chicken chunks in it.  I'd be curious to try more seafood and the jamaican jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Love coming here for there happy hour every week. It has great appetizers. I highly recommend the beef empanadas, so good."}
{"text":"Awesome appetizers and awesome desserts!
 Unfortunately, I have been three times and cannot, for the life of me, seem to remember a single entree. Must have appetizers  are as follows: West indies Beef patties, fire roasted jerk shrimp, crab claws st. thomas, island onion rings,  jamaican jerk wings."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  Had a salad and onion rings.......we did order spinach dip for the group and that was solid. 

Service was really bad tho........our server was too busy paying attention to others.......he screwed up a few times.....but the big one was when I told him no cucumber since I am allergic."}
{"text":"Paella was super flavorful and filled with substantial amount of seafood. Was way too much but our waitress quickly boxed it up for us without having to ask for it!  My husband had chicken kabob and he lived it. Love the ambience and lively Caribbean music. Our servers were attentive and on top of all our extra requests. Only advice for 5 star rating is up front hostess needs people skills. She's not well trained OR she needs to be reassigned to different position where she doesn't get overwhelmed with minute issues!  Chocolate upside down cake was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here for drinks yesterday. The bar staff was super friendly and we got our drinks quick. The first round was very strong but the second round tasted extremely watered down. Everything we ordered had the same Dark Rum in it so I'm not sure how the taste differed so much. When I told the bartender we were ready for the check he acknowledged my request then ignored us for at least 10 mins. I finally had to ask another staff member for the check."}
{"text":"Ok so I had to \"live in Vegas\" for a couple weeks while working on a Casino and my \"home\" ended up right across the street from this place. Which in case you were not aware, is apparently in a bad neighborhood. I was warned by 1) the cab driver dropping me off from the airport 2) a co-worker and 3) another cabby taking me home from work--that I should never walk alone after 5pm. The menu looked pretty good, so I was excited to try this place. The service was so slow. We were seated immediately and then ignored for like 20 min. then our order taken and then ignored for 30 min, we asked what was up and they had made the order wrong, but no one told us. Finally after being in the restaurant for about an hour and a half we got our food. It was okay, but definitely not worth the wait. It was the type of chain like food one would expect from a Chili's or TGIF and they got the order wrong. We talked to the manager and he did not seem to care. Moral of my story--this place is no breeze."}
{"text":"We love going here! The Jerk Chicken Pasta is to DIE for... 

Anyone who goes needs to try it out!"}
{"text":"Loved my Birthday lunch! I had the seafood tortillas. I did want the lunch to end! Loved the atmosphere. Music was great!"}
{"text":"Our server's name was Lindsay. She had a smile very unique to her. Warm and calming. She lightened up the entire establishment with her kind smile. She was very attentive and gave us our space at the same time. A quality and skill that not too many servers possess. 
Although I don't remember the manager's name, he provided helpful suggestions to wonderful food and ways to prepare it which were not all on the menu. He personally checked back with us later and offered other options... Including wonderful desserts."}
{"text":"Bahamas Breeze used to be one of my favorite restaurant a few years ago...not anymore.

The food to me has gone downhill. Before, I never had a bad meal here. Now, it's been a hit or a miss...more misses than hits. My favorite used to be the jerk chicken bow tie pasta but it's subpar to me now. 

The service is very slow & some of the waiters are just down right rude. The last time I was there the waiter was so nasty, our party just decided to leave instead of getting a new waiter. Worst service I've ever encountered & don't think I'll ever go back because of that experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for a gathering.  Sat in the enclosed patio and the service was fantastic. Jason and Brandon worked hard to ensure all of our needs were met.  Some friends and I took advantage of the happy hour menu.  I agree with all of the reviewers that the coconut shrimp is amazing!  The Jamaican jerk chicken wings were also awesome.  I'd also recommend the empanadas that were such amazing comfort food!  The $3.21 cocktails for their birthday wee great as well!  All in all I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at fair prices.  The coconut shrimp is the best anywhere.  It is offered as a combo with a side salad or soup, or as entire meal.  The service is friendly and efficient.  Good service is a real plus and the hostess and servers remember their past customers.  This is a chain restaurant, but operates with independence, except for its chain menu."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best time to go! The beef empanadas and coconut shrimp is flavorful.  The ultimate pina colada is refreshing.  The warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake is to die for."}
{"text":"It's like a TGIF type deal w/ tasteless generic food w/ some \"islandy\" decorations. There's no real carribean taste and no dishes that stand out. Two things to try though, are the tostones w/ chicken which is like plaintain nachos, the plaintains are deepfried twice and the blended island margarita."}
{"text":"Took mom for her 77th birthday. Never again.. It took 15 for the servers to figure out who's table was who's. We ordered drinks. Then food. They brought our drinks with our food. It took 25 minutes to get our Drinks.. Are you serious. We were in deep family conversation so it took us a while to realize they totally forgot our appetizers. Worst part ever after I told the server it was my moms birthday they NEVER brought anything out to sing her happy birthday. I spent over $100. For crap service. Very upset only thing manager did was offer to give her a dessert to go. Really you guys ruined her birthday party. You guys should be embarrassed. I attempted to call Corporate and never got a response. Kudos"}
{"text":"Can I just how much I love this place? LOVE IT. 

From the moment you walk in, walk to your table, eat, leave, sit back in your car...you think...\"Now that was just amazing!\" 

Every single time my wife and I go here to eat the food is outstanding and the staff is incredible. Now a days it's hard to get good food and good customer service, but these people get it and do well at it. 

We will always be back and will always want to tell others about this place too. Thank you all for producing a great product and taking your job seriously. See y'all soon again!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and had one very bad experience. I spoke with Dan the manager and he assured me it wouldn't happen again. We went back last week and Brandon was our waiter. I must say he was awesome. Drinks and food all came in a timely manner and he checked on us many times. This is what I'm used to getting at Bahama Breeze. 
I highly recommend this place.  I will be back. Thank you Dan and Brandon."}
{"text":"I love the Habanero Wings. If you are a wing lover like me Bahama Breeze provides a unique spin that you won't find anywhere else. The wings were all a good size and it's served with a nice flavored sour cream that perfectly complements the flavor of the wings and balanced the spice of the Habanero.  My server Devin was also very friendly and attentive.  I had a great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined here a few times and thought we had found another favorite. 
The Habanero wings are good. The Key Lime pie is very authentic. However when we decided to go there for my wife's birthday we were extremely disappointed. I ordered Jerk Chicken. I ate about half of the chicken when I realized it was getting difficult to pull the meat from the bone. This generally means chicken is undercooked. When I showed our server he called over the manager who insisted she have it remade for us. I told her I didn't really want a remake. So I opted for it to go. I was really disappointed when I told them it was my wife's birthday and ordered Key Lime pie expecting they would make her feel important with some sort of Birthday thing. But what we got was a waiter who said \" pretend I sang for you and then you blew out a birthday candle then walked away. 
I will never go back to Bahama Breeze nor do I recommend them to anyone else. I can see now why they were not busy near the strip on Friday night. Diners Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour is the best!

You don't have to sit by the bar or at a particular area of the restaurant to get their happy hour specials, which is a huge bonus!  Happy hour is from 4-6 pm Monday - Friday.  Their prices are outstanding, and the service is awesome!  Drinks are strong and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent drinks our waiter whose name is Dave is unbelievable we set in the patio with the rest of the meet-up group and had a wonderful time"}
{"text":"Had reservations for 10 on a Wednesday at 6pm, 630, still no table. Manager points to a table, telling that it's my table, have to wait for them to leave. Meanwhile, other possibilities to seat us are evident, even an unused room. Manager blunty reports \"room is closed'. No offer for a beverage or anything to possibly compensate for the inconvenience. We left, never to return. Seems he couldn't have cared less."}
{"text":"I love be the patio here!! Great service, very polite and attentive. They have a Jamaican hot sauce to die for and a great happy hour."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ingredients and food preparation at this chain restaurant. I had Ahi tuna and black bean soup and both were special. Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"This chain is part of the Darden Group (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, etc)

Pros:  Great Food (the last 2 times for both my husband and myself)
           Atmosphere is very nice and different from the usual PGH fare.
           There's a really nice patio/outdoor dining deck that's nice             (depending on the weather), if you can pick up the whole restaurant and plop it down on a beach, it would look totally @ home!  

Cons:  Pricey (as most large chains tend to be)
            Wait staff is inconsistent.


First Visit:  Fabulous!  Food was great and our server was sooo good that we earned him a \"Pineapple\"!  (which I will explain later)

Second Visit (7/19/10):  Food was great, service was absolutely awful!
We sat outside, which is \"seat yourself\" and 
A.)  it was quite a while before we were acknowledged and drink orders taken.
B.)  we were clearly not our waitress'  priority.
The food runner ran all of our food and my husband was in need of another drink after the appetizer which went completely un-noticed the duration of the meal.  We looked and looked for ANYone to grab a refill and it was a ghost town on the patio other than the other patrons.


PINEAPPLES:  If you have a great experience with the server assigned to you, if you ask to speak with a manager to tell him/her how awesome your server was, the server \"earns a pineapple\" for the guest compliment to their service.
Its a nice thing to do to show how much you appreciate it when someone does treat you right all night!   :)"}
{"text":"We came for late night happy hour.  We had two shrimp dishes.   They were excellent.  The service was great.  Good casual ambiance.  Lindsey was our waitress.  Lindsey did an excellent job.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine hosted a business dinner here and invited me to join them.  It's been a while since I've visited this joint, so I gladly accepted.  When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).

The Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.

For an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was \"rich\".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!

Overall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.

{"text":"I came in here with one of my co-workers for their late night happy hour. Their appetizers are half off during happy hour and the portions are what make it worth your while. 

I got the crispy onion rings, the lobster & shrimp quesadilla, and the Jamaican chicken wings. For a drink, I just stuck with the coconut water.

The crispy onion rings have a panko-coconut breading that's fried to a golden-brown. The coconut flavor is really subtle, but you can't go wrong with this classic appetizer.

The lobster & shrimp quesadilla was pretty amazing. Who would've ever thought that cheese and shellfish would be a perfect match? They came with pico de gallo and sour cream on the side, which go perfect with these little triangles of cheesy goodness. The lobster seemed a little sparing, but the shrimp was definitely there.

The Jamaican chicken wings had the perfect marinade to it. The jerk spices added a unique zing to the wings that blast your tastebuds with rich flavor! The spiciness factor isn't too hot. It won't burn your tongue, but it definitely has a noticeable kick. 

I'll be back to try their entrees, but their appetizers are really something special. Any place that has amazing deals for their happy hour is worth it to me!"}
{"text":"Was in town and stopped here for lunch. Good food, clean, great service."}
{"text":"The food was alright I had a burger however I had better. The drinks were pretty good I have to say. That's the only reason I'm giving them 3stars the drinks"}
{"text":"I generally avoid rating chain restaurants, but I am obsessed with Bahama Breeze and try to visit one everywhere I go.  Usually places that have an \"exotic\" decor relative to what you're used to are just banking on that, and the food isn't anything special.  Well, I've eaten at this BB on three separate occasions, and I've found the food to be consistently delicious, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere delightful.  I've been here with a lot of former Disney cast members like myself, and we've all agreed that the way the staff here handles its customers is admirably similar to the Disney standard.

It's been a few years since I've been here so I don't really recall what I had to eat besides the onion rings, which were big, juicy, and crispy.  I'd love to come back next time I go home to visit.  (I currently live in San Diego.)"}
{"text":"Though I am neither a big Caribbean food buff nor a Caribbean food connoisseur, I am proud to say that Bahama Breeze has hit all my five-star-diamond standard. 

The food is absolutely fantastic, and the service is excellent. It is a fairly good-sized restaurant, yet the food and the service are delivered at the great speed. 

Unfortunately, I'm not quite cool with the seafood. (I get allergic to seafood from time to time.) I did taste my friends' seafood dishes for a bite, and they were yummy. I personally liked to order BBQ Ribs and Pork Tenderloin. Great choices though."}
{"text":"Driven by the joint for years, finally stopped in. Was pleasantly surprised by large drink and food menu. Very friendly wait staff. Was Reggae Fest wth live music, guitar player/singer and his computer-track band."}
{"text":"Great quality food, customer service, and atmosphere. This restaurant feels like you are on an island somewhere- nice escape."}
{"text":"Some of the best jerk chicken west of da Islands painkillers are a great tease also when in Sin City this is my first stop gotta make happy hour for more fun so many great choices gonna visit tomorrow night also love bringing new people here they are pleasantly surprised a little taste of the virgin islands and Jamaica  you can't pass this gem while in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time the other day, and I have 0 complaints! I was a little skeptical because I've never eaten at a Caribbean restaurant before but the food here is so so good!!! The waitress that we had was amazing as well, she was so funny and genuine. I would definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant seemed mostly empty. Was given a pager and was told no more than 10 minutes to wait. 20 mins later i was seated. Waiter was very friendly, but a little too sparky for me. Took a half an hour to take our dinner order. Have been here over an hour and still haven't gotten my food yet. Wait. Just came. How am I supposed to eat this whole burger with this little bitty cup of ketchup? Smh. My daughter ordered her burger medium well. It was burnt to a crisp. Food over all was bleh.  Service was friendly, but horrible."}
{"text":"From the outside, Bahama Breeze looks like a franchise restaurant that should've been closed in the 90s. But, their happy hour is something worth checking out. From 4:00-6:00 pm, a 20 oz. draft beer is only $3! The firecracker shrimp street tacos (3) were my favorite and half off as were the rest of the appetizers. The habanero chicken wings weren't that spicy, but you get at least a dozen wings. The lobster and shrimp quesadilla was a bit lackluster. Otherwise, great happy hour find!"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating feels like your in Key West. Good, solid Caribbean food, happy hour starts again at 9:00, reasonable prices, good drinks."}
{"text":"Listen.  When you have a group of 18 to 21 people it can never be easy.  I'm sure the wait staff do not enjoy.  Plus issuing separate checks and keeping it all organized this cannot be an easy task.  Saturday night we were there and it was a very large party.  Jerry and I cannot remember the gals name kept up with us all night.  Very accommodating.  Very courteous.  Very attentive.  It was nice.  The food is ok.  It can cater to a lot of different tastes.  Pasta to steak to hummus and nachos.  Drinks were good.  It can get loud but we've obviously made it one of our stops each time we come into Vegas.  We always have a large crowd when we do our annual trip and this place just gets it.  

Thank you BB."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday party and the happy hour menu was amazing!!!!! OMG sooo much drinks and appetizers for such a low cost. 

You have to try the Ultimate piña Colada. If you like sweet drinks then... Please do yourself a favor and order one lol happy price is only $4."}
{"text":"Not very welcoming. For got my drinks twice luckily I had water in my diaper bag.

Didn't seem like they wanted to help us. Christina was our server. No one got refills and we couldn't even ask because she wasn't around. People that served our food didn't seem like they wanted to work. 

Food looked AMAZING just like the pictures. 

I got a salmon salad and it had to much dressing. 

Spoke to the manager very professional he said sorry still left a tip wish I hadn't service was horrible"}
{"text":"Heading out of Vegas after a nice weekend we wanted to grab a bite to eat off of the strip. It's my job to choose our restaurants so as we drove by Bahama Breeze something made me say say \"stop, turn here!\" I'm glad we did.  It's your typical chain restaurant with oversized booths and waiters in tropical shirts, but we were both pleased with our meals and our friendly waiter. We had the beef empenada appetizer, the chicken kabob over yellow rice and the fresh jerk salmon of the day. The food was seasoned well and the menu has plenty to choose from without being overwhelming. 

The food was reasonably priced for lunch and the portions were great, not too much food it was perfect. Our waiter was so sweet and even gave us a tip on a great place to go shopping! The tropical drinks looked great, so next time I visit I would like to try one.  It was a nice relaxing comforting lunch to end our fun trip in Vegas."}
{"text":"When will you put a Bahama Breeze in SOCAL? I love this place! The appetizer cajon shrimp platter with bread is the best thing I've ever tasted.  I have been writing letters to the company to expand westward for years, but no feedback and no outcome :( BEST FOOD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best decision we made coming here tonight was leaving our booth to dine at the bar and I am so glad we did! We had the BEST service from Russell & Evann. No exaggeration - these two fellas were on top of it!!! Plenty of conversation & lots of suggestions of cool things to do during our stay.

Now about the food .... WOW! Everything tasted fresh & amazing. Our appetizers were like entrees they were so big! We loved the seared sesame crusted Ahi, coconut shrimp & chicken quesadillas. If we didn't come hungry & ready to pack in some grub the appetizers would have been enough because we also had cocktails. But we also ordered bowls! The plantain bowl was my favorite!!!! sweet & salty all in one dish and I was able to substitute the ground beef for jackfruit #Vegetarian. 

This may become a regular stop whenever we visit Vegas! But ONLY if we post up at the bar - the service in regular dining started off suspect & unimpressive LOL"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after a long day at the Convention Center for the builder's show.  It's approximately two miles away and conveniently located on Paradise and Flamingo.  You walk in and definitely get the vibe of being in the Bahamas.  Fresh water flowing, tropical decor everywhere and many choices of rum mixed drinks with flavors that bring you back to paradise at sea.

Items Ordered:
- Firecracker Shrimp (Appetizer)
- Jerk Chicken Fettucini (Entree)

My initial appetizer was quite good and I'm not sure what the sauce was made from, but it was very flavorful.  Was definitely in the caliber for bang bang shrimp from Bonefish Grill.  The jerk chicken Fettucini definitely had a nice kick after each bite and made my taste buds crave more.  The portions for both entree and appetizer were extremely generous and I'm so glad I split my meal with my wife.  I really wanted to try the pineapple mixed drink, but unfortunately I was in working hours.  I'd definitely like to come back for happy hour and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"this is a cool place. . i went the people that were there for the wedding the food was good i liked the pasta ordered .  the survuce was fast  and they seated our large groups quickly. they had a good tropical look. like i said in a bast review i would not have gone there if i was by myself. i wanted to do stuff more unique to Vegas"}
{"text":"I love the Calypso Pasta with shrimp so much, that I learned to make it myself. West Indies Patties are soo good as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now.  There isn't really anything terrible at the place. It's just a little pricey for what you get. Each time I walk out I think to myself, \" Self, you could have done just as well somewhere else for half the price.\"  Overall, I would say skip it and find something else to satiate your hunger."}
{"text":"Tasty overall! Came for lunch. Sister had the habanero wings and the jerk shrimp, very good! Daughter had the chicken tenders, mediocre. I had the chicken curry over rice with naan. The naan, eh, nothing special. The coconit curry sauce and rice very flavorful and decent amount of spice. Chicken was over cooked and hard. Service was just ok."}
{"text":"I ordered fish tacos with yellow rice and told waitress to put spicy taco sauce on the side and it came with it on it so I literally ate just the fish and not the taco or contents bc it tasted like garbage and the rice sucked ass so I didn't eat anything but the fish out of the taco I rate it a garbage can."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Our waitress Sandra was great.  They were missing some of the items on the menu. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I attended a group event here. The food and service were exceptional! The staff was attentive to all of our needs.  I would recommend this restaurant for group or individual dining!  Their coconut shrimp is the best I've had!"}
{"text":"overall pretty good.. applewood bacon & cheddar burger was so bomb.. 

they use fresh ground beef so don't be scared 2 order it a little red if u like it that way...

service was fast and always attentive.."}
{"text":"Overall not too bad.  Nice service.  The pulled pork had a weird taste.  That is my only complaint.  the onion rings were hot and crisp.  The fries were also hot.  The yet of the meals were ok.  The price was a little high.  We had 6 appetizers, 1/2 price, and 3 drinks, 1/2 price as well, Happy Hour.  The bill was $55.00.  At full price would have been over $100.00.  There was not a meal.  So overall ok food, but the price is little high."}
{"text":"We took our mother out for dinner last night (5-27-2015).  I chose Bahama Breeze at the Robinson Town Center Mall area.  She had never been there in all the years she has lived in Pittsburgh.  My wife also hd never been to a Bahama Breeze.  I am very familiar with the ones in Orlando Florida.

Mom had the Jerk Chicken and my wife had the Coconut Shrimp. They were amazed .at the great taste and quality of the food.  I had never tried their BBQ ribs.  They were the meatiest ribs I have ever had and delicious. Our mom could not stop raving about the food and beverages.  At 92 she has been round the world and has very specific likes and dislikes.

I must add that we were seated promptly at our reserved time.  The servers were very attentive and well trained.  We all had a great evening."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. I usually get the tropical fruit salad which is a good healthy choice. I changed it up a little and had the salmon with mango glaze, cinnamon sweet potatoes, and greens beans; it was prepared well and very flavorful. I also love how the seating and the ambiance that bahama breeze creates."}
{"text":"I had a voucher for $25 for Darden Restaurants and from the choices available, I opted to try Bahama Breeze.

I arrived about 5:15 and was seated in a rather empty restaurant except for a private party in one room.  I was seated immediately and my server, Mike, came over and ask for drink order and let me know if I had any questions about the menu to ask.  He got my iced tea.

I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional. 

The main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.  

For dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as \"rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.\"  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.

Mike's service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.

Bahama Breeze was an OK place."}
{"text":"Called a simple quesadilla in, I arrived 22 min later to find out they never made it. I waited for them to make it and I was offered a beverage while I waiting, but lemonade was not an option, only fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Came in after my soccer game for a late night dinner. I ordered a water and ginger ale to drink... And BOTH beverages had mysterious items floating in it (yuck)! It looked like pulp from lemons or lines... Our server changed the beverages out, but it still looked like something extra was floating in the cups so I opted not to drink anything.

We also had to pay our tab right as we got our food. Slightly annoying but I can dig it. I ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken. It's actually pretty good and flavored/seasoned quite well. Their plantains are good as well. 

Not sure what was up with the beverage situation but I'd likely come back in 4-6 months."}
{"text":"Please go out of business!! Besides your restaurant being dirty a majority of the time, your managers are racist. I'm applaud at the lack of respect you gave patrons the other day. Since you were checking to see if they had money, you should have checked all their degrees. Yes, educated women with jobs!!! Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for first time and was told a 30 minute wait for sunroom or window seating because one server did not show up for work. Seriously ??  Lost several customers today. The greeter didn't seem to know what to do."}
{"text":"We have eaten here more than a half dozen times and we have never been disappointed. The food, service and atmosphere is fantastic. Whether it's shrimp, jerk chicken, fish tacos, Cuban sandwhich, or key west nachos, it's all excellent. My only complaint is that I have to drive 45-50 minutes from Canton to get here."}
{"text":"Worst Bahama Breeze I've ever eaten at. Went in there starving and couldn't even finish the Taste of Jamaica dish I ordered, meats were dry and rice was crunchy. Go by there quite often and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"First time at one of these chains. the atmosphere was cool the service was great the Drinks Alone deserve the 5-star rating. We had the drink that they make in the pineapple and it was awesome! coconut shrimp was delicious as well the main courses were good too"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Calypso Shrimp and Mojito Cubano! Huge portions seasoned to perfection. Service was great and food served extremely quick!"}
{"text":"Came here with a whole bunch of people but we sat around in different tables.  Someone on my table ordered the tower onion rings.  That was heavy, greasy, and alright.

I ordered a jerk chicken pasta which was good and had the right amount of spice.  But the grease built up quick and could be toned down some.  I was able to try my friends chicken breast and I liked the mango salsa that came with it.  So far we have:

Appetizers:  Onion Rings (3/5).
Entrees:  Jerk Chicken Pasta (3/5) and Grilled Chicken Breast (4/5).  

But the best was yet to come!  I ordered a chocolate mousse dessert, the chocolate island.  It was made with a perfectly baked brownie!  Taadaa... Dessert:  Chocolate Island.(6/5). 

Service was alright, the restaurant was busy and the fan above our table wasn't working.  -.-  I didn't really feel the Bahama vibe but it could also be because I didn't order anything that that could be found outside Bahama Breeze.  There is that cool firepit thing to the left of the restaurant when you first walk in, i want to sit there next time!"}
{"text":"Haven't really been to Bahama Breeze in years....but thanks to a Red Lobster gift card (both restaurants belong to Darden), and a Valentine's date for some KISS Mini Golf (review on that later), we were hungry!

Got to say, restaurant is still not bad for a Caribbean-themed chain.  Place was hoppin'!  Very, very busy.  Folks must like their congo music, eh?  Breezy.  Luckily even with no reservations our wait time for a table was less than five minutes.  Like the place - open, airy, noisy, and boy do I love the smell of Jerk chicken on the grills.  I'm really hoping that it's cooked on an open charcoal flame, but I'm pretty sure it's probably not.  Can't have everything I suppose.

After getting seated and giving our drink order (Bahama Breeze using bottles of Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach is tasty but a tad pricy) we were ready to view the menu.  It really is a bit of a mix, some Jamaican, some Caribbean, some American.  Fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty.

Wifey couldn't decide so she settled on the Island Hopper ($19.99) - appetizer sampler platter of sorts that included their signature Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings, and conch fritters.  It came with sauce sides of jerk BBQ sauce, citrus mustard, and a roasted pineapple chutney.  For the most part she enjoyed it.  The Jamaican chicken wings were a bit smaller than she remembered but they were still very tasty with a peppery kick.  Coconut shrimp were indeed crispy, but light, with good hints of sweet when dipped in the pineapple chutney.  Conch fritters were only OK, a bit forgetful because they tasted more of a hush puppy with very little conch inside.  And the onion rings, well they were just onion rings.

I ended up getting the Cuban Sandwich ($10.99) and while I did like it, I should have read the menu better.  Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce & tomato in a Cuban sandwich??  And salami???  Very, very strange.  Just do it like the Cubans guys - marinated roasted pork, good ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed in a plancha till golden brown.  Simple!  Thank you Jon Favreau of Iron Man and Chef fame!  I think I would have enjoyed this sandwich a lot more without the extra fluff, but did applaud the effort of Bahama Breeze trying to make the sandwich their own.  Next time I would just order it with no lettuce & tomato, or just put it on the side.

Overall a good experience at Bahama Breeze, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was stellar without being pretentious.  The food could use some tweaking but that's par for the course.  If this place wasn't so far from where we live I would be likely to check out their menu further or at least come down for their hoppin' Happy Hour.

Jamaican me crazy!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place just couldn't seem to pick a type of food and stick with it. Is it a burger joint? An Italian eatery ? A Caribbean restaurant ? The menu is all over the place and the quality of the food is barely edible. There isn't much else that I can add that hasn't already been said about this place, but I certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my family over Thanksgiving holiday for lunch.  We were getting sick of buffets so decided to try something different.  Food is average.  We ordered the wings (big size!), lobster quesadillas with side of seafood chowder, coconut shrimp with side of chicken tortilla soup and portabello mushroom burger.  Only items that stood out were the seafood chowder and wings.  Burger was not very good, something about all the ingredients and manchego cheese just did not work well together.  Their signature lemonade with cane sugar is very good.  Overall, the ambiance is cute and tropical inside.  Nice getaway from the Vegas crowds!!"}
{"text":"Great, beautiful, and perfect priced! I do reccomend the Jerk Shrimp Appetizer and the Banana nut covered in brandy sauce for dessert.. So delicious  The service here is very calm and assertive to your need and delivers well. Sunday through Thursday they have happy hour after 9 til close and all appetizers are half off great deal!! Come and try it yourself #jerksauce is good on everything"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and enjoyed every minute of it. Food was great not to mention the service."}
{"text":"I've lived here a year and never been to this place.  It's been on my radar

It was great.  Good food good drinks.  We sat on the patio and had a great lunch 

KAT the manager came and talked to us and was so friendly.    Ryan are server was great. Super nice 

Only complaint would be to have to pay $1.50 for the bread with my pasta.  I've never seen that anywhere ever"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Bahama Breeze while In Vegas. We had such a great time. But it was mostly due to the great team of Jarrod and Raven. They were the best servers EVER!! 

We got there just in time for a GREAT happy hour. We all ordered the pineapple coconut martini. It was the best!! And then got 2 orders of the best coconut shrimp I have ever had. Loved the crunch and the coconut was cooked perfect. The dipping sauce made it taste even better. 

We then ordered a bunch of apps and they were all delish too. We also ordered the coconut mojitos. It was like a dessert. Sooooo good. 

But our servers Jarrod and Raven made our night even better. They took such great care of us!! They were just amazing. They really know their stuff. 

I just wish Bahama Breeze was in California. I have to come all the way to Las Vegas to eat there."}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason to back to this place.  I wouldn't go back on my own, wouldn't recommend it to anyone & would suggest an alternative if it was suggested.  The only reason it's not a 1 is that the waitress was great.
All the entrees were overpriced & my jalapeno grits tasted like a bland bowl of cream-of-wheat.  
The food wasn't rancid & the environment was standard chain issue, but I can't recommend this place - go to a steakhouse if you're going to spend $20-25 a plate."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is a really beautiful location. We recently had a company dinner here. We are a large group. My group was able to sit at a large, fun, circular table with a fit pit in the middle. It was too hot for a fire, but we enjoyed the inclusive nature of our seating that allowed for group conversation and laughter. Our group had chosen a fixed menu (chicken or fish) that was able to appeal to everyone in attendance. Veggies offered were fresh and full of taste. I am only giving three stars because I would like to say that the staff did their best to accommodate our large group - but they fell a little short by serving everyone in our group except about five people. Those five were forgotten to the point that the staff approached and asked if we were ready for boxes while our settings were clear and we were awkwardly sitting there. We had to specifically ask to be served food (despite being served drinks all night). Large groups are tough to serve, but having experienced and aware staff on hand would really make a huge difference in these settings. Luckily, their strawberry margarita was ON POINT."}
{"text":"Very slow service tonight. Not even busy. Took at least ten minutes to be greeted by server. $22 steak somewhat gristly. Had to wait for a steak knife that should have been brought to the table before the steak arrived. Server seemed uninterested. Asparagus extremely small and hard. Only the yellow rice was any good. Not too much to be excited about."}
{"text":"Great service!! Food was good! Unclear pricing so minus one star. The orders came quick and the waiter was nice and handled our big party nicely."}
{"text":"Top notch service, wonderful food, great atmosphere, what more can you ask for?   Our server Mitch was great!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot out this week and was pretty good except the steak didnt have any flavor but the jerk wings were good the firecracker shrimp was good .. would come back again to try some other stuff here lots of selections on the menu"}
{"text":"3 stars for the fire cracker shrimps and customer service. But the Calypso shrimp linguine is absolutely disgusting, also do not order steak from this place. No seasoning and just wasn't good quality steak."}
{"text":"At first everything seemed great service was good drinks for refilled on time then I received my Jamaican jerk pasta which was supposed to have a cream sauce and it was extremely watery like someone just poured milk in it I was hungry so I ate it however I would not order it again our server then asked us to stack up our plates , which I thought was kind a odd because we don't work there 
however we did and set them aside 
we then ordered dessert however they forgot one of our guests And he had to wait for his dessert we pretty much had finished all of ours when his arrived and we asked why it took so long and she said we had to make more whip cream 
I do have to say the portion of sizes were large however they are way out of whack for pricing extremely expensive I will not be going back again"}
{"text":"I go to Bahama Breeze in Seattle & Vegas.  Love this  place.  Great atmosphere. Food, drinks & service are always right on point.  Tonight I had the jerk chicken sliders, jerk chicken pasta and key lime pie for dessert. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just average nothing to write home about. Very expensive average food. Onion rings ok. I had a steak just average."}
{"text":"If I never have to step foot in another Darden Restaurant ever again, my culinary life would be so much more diverse. My palate would be much happier too. But shamefully, I have been sucked into the Breeze a few times too many, but not without protest I must add!

[Chain Restaurant Rant] 
For some odd reason, way too many people find these places appealing. Typical Darden Restaurants and most other big fancy-schmancy chains are propped up in mass trafficked, comfortable, suburban safe zones. The buildings that these restaurants are housed in are often made to project an elaborate architectural structure meant to impress. (I'm talking to you too Cheesecake Factory). It's almost as if to trick those who don't know any better into thinking what they are about to enter into is the pinnacle of a all dinning destinations. What many fail to realize though is that these chains lack soul, character, authenticity and a sense of local community. Atlas, I struggle to find the appeal that so many others seem to be drawn to. 
[/Chain Restaurant Rant]

Whether it's the convenient locale or the familiarity of a chain, I've been invited to Bahama Breeze to meet with friends and family of mine on a few occasions. The wait on the weekend is usually unbearable. The sounds of the faux steel drum island beats in the background is corny as hell. 

To help temper the pain, my first order of business upon entering this torture chamber is to get nice and liqueured up and as fast as possible. Unfortunately for me, there's not much variety on the beer & wine list, which consists mostly of boring domestics and a nifty house beer called \"Aruba Red\" (I bet whoever thought of that name thought they were a freakin' genius!). I hate to burst their bubble though, but Aruba Red tastes like any other boring domestic lager, but with red food coloring. Blach! On a more positive note, I've been told the Mojito's were good, but I can't vouch for those either. 

As for the menu, it consists of uninspiring interpretations of Americanized Caribbean food. A starch with pineapple or corn salsa dumped on top seems to fit their idea of \"Caribbean\", while other dishes consist mostly of salt, lots and lots of iodized salt! I typically play it safe and choke down the Cuban Sandwich. 

Why the two stars? The majority of my friends and family seem perfectly happy after a night out here and when they're happy, so am I. The second because without boring chains, I wouldn't have nearly the appreciation I do for the local joints."}
{"text":"Well, well, well, Bahama Breeze. I thought that I would be able to go to this establishment with some close friends to enjoy a nice dinner. Our experience tonight has truly made us never want to go to this business again. I suggest that anyone that reads this takes this information to heart. My friend had to use the bathroom and he has Parkinsons so he cannot use the bathroom on his own and needed my help. To put this as clean as possibly I was directing his stream in the bathroom when a worker walked in. He made some rude, sarcastic comment to us and walked out. I was shocked. I thought that this harassment would be over but when we returned to our tables the owner came to our table to talk to us. We did not want to scare our dates off so we just apologized but the owner accused us of peeing on the wall. He told us that it was a family friendly establishment and it wouldn't be tolerated. Now this is 2017. I don't understand why people still cannot accept someone for who they are. It has been scientifically proven that the hypothalamus lights up for certain interactions and that it lights up in a different way for one's sexual preference. They cannot change the way they are. The owner refused to believe our story and its sad that he harassed my friend due to his disability. If you have any respect for the people on this earth then please do not come to this business. They are extremely homophobic and provided a miserable experience. The food was not even that good and not worth the prices that they were. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and have been satisfied each time. It is one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I have ever got here has been delicious. Some yummy and highly recommended dishes here are the jerk chicken pasta, shrimps and grits, and any of their fresh fish (I personally love their tilapia). The service is usually pretty good and fast and they have a fun atmosphere. They occasionally have live music playing. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I love this place..we come here everytime we go to vegas..jamaician wings are delicious..there my favthing on the menu..crispy and full of flavor!I tried the butermilk fried chicken sliders....they were good....husband had a salmon pasta that he loved..lots of salmon in it.alcohol drinks are great too..all of them!

{"text":"Ok , this review is just for their happy hour, which is probably one of the cheapest and best in town !!   3$ large draft beers and half off selected appetizers , hell yeah !! They also have 4$ and 5$ cocktails using decent brands as well , and happy hour is available anywhere in the restaurant, which is great for people with children!!  Some happy hour highlights are the spinach dip , a large bowl of gooey goodness served with warm chips , also their wings are amazing no matter which you choose ( the Jamaican jerk , tho are an acquired taste ) and the large portion of coconut battered onion rings are crispy and delicious ! So check them out !!"}
{"text":"I like Bahama Breeze for something a little different.  It is part of the Darden family of restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Long Horn Steakhouse) but this is neither Italian, seafood or steak.  Sure, they have pasta, fish and beef but that is not what they're about. 

Bahama Breeze is about the feel of the Caribbean.  The place looks like a beach resort that one may find in, say, the Bahamas. There are palm trees, torches, fruity cocktails and an overall laid back atmosphere.  The menu is substantial and has something for just about anybody.  It is a restaurant/menu I have been enjoying for over 10 years.  

I started coming here with my office for a holiday party.  Then we came back for a retirement party.  And again for a going away party.  Maybe even two.  I've come in with family a couple of times now also.  Each time I stop in I try somthing different.  Coconut shrimp (amazing and unfortunately not an option for me any more), chicken skewers and rice (not on the menu any more), West Indies curry rice bowl, jerk chicken pasta, buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I've tried the black bean soup.  I've tried a salad.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here.

I've had some of the drinks too.  A sample of the coconut mojito which was good but very sweet.  A taste of the watermelon jalepeno margarita.  A zombie (which I seem to remember liking very much).  I did have an off pint of Guiness once.  Not sure what happened to that keg but it wasn't good.  However, I've also had a Newcastle here and it was spot on.  

Service has always been consistent and pleasent.  Even coming in on Mother's Day with a 7:00 PM reservation went off without a hitch.  We were seated just before our scheduled time and were waited on equally quick.  Having taken the time to look at the drinks and food, we ordered and just got to talking.  Before we knew it we had all that we had ordered and the meal had begun.  We were out of there by 8:15.  Not bad considering how busy this place was on a holiday."}
{"text":"This was one of the more fascinating restaurants I have seen on the inside. the view was very pleasant, staff was extremely nice and fast with their food I am very impressed I recommend if you like seafood to at least visit this place in Pittsburgh it's worth the while."}
{"text":"Okay, I came back again to give this place a second chance and since I'm staying in a hotel across the parking lot for two weeks.  Plus all the other restaurants nearby were pretty crowded.  This time I sat at the bar, thinking I would actually get served this time.  And I did.  It was okay.  The food was alright and the happy hour prices I lucked into were awesome.  However, I was forced to sit on the side of the bar nearest the kitchen giving me great insight to this place and after sitting here for an hour I just can't help, but feel like I'm on the set of \"Waiting\" the movie."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas for relaxation... Wanted to try different restaurants and some food and drinks we don't get often where we live. My husband loves coconut shrimp, so I looked up restaurants that served them. There was  Bahama Breeze and Kahunaville, (which is in T.I.) I made reservations with Kahunaville for later in the week,... (which we HATED)... but went to the early happy hour at Bahama Breeze.(they even have two happy hour times, early and late) Kahunaville, ended up being one HUGE MESS of noise, and the food was mediocre and expensive,( I reckon because it being on the strip). 
  But back to Bahama Breeze. The place was great! It is in a mall of restaurants and parking was a ...\"breeze\"...(get it?)... It had the atmosphere with the truly tropical feel of  shutters, lanais, wood,  bamboo, gardens, fire pits, open and airy. Man, even the men's restroom was great! 
  The happy hour menu was fantastic! $3.00 & $4.00 drinks, and 1/2 off appetizers! Our server was Sam, and she was great, fast and efficient.
We had the beef empanadas: nice and spicy, with a nice fruity salsa, the warm goat cheese dip with flatbread crisps: GREAT! The cheese comes in warm bell peppers. The coconut shrimp: you get 6 fairly large perfectly seasoned shrimp with a spicy mustard sauce... in fact my husband ordered two of them... The tropical drinks we ordered were far more superior and tasty than Kahunaville... and a lot less expensive! 
  Over all Bahama Breeze got our vote for BEST \"Island food and drink\" in Las Vegas.
In the words of a past Governor of CA, \" I'll be back!\" I want to try it all!"}
{"text":"great happy hour specials, this place makes you forget about the desert"}
{"text":"I have not often been to a place of such trashery. First of all- how do you burn sautéed salmon. This is debauchery! The building was cold as my asparagus. I wrote a haiku about the Bahama Breeze in Robinson township.

Bahama Breeze ew.
My salmon was burnt ew gross.
Get me out of here!"}
{"text":"Ok I get the customer is king thing but this was over the top...the waiter was at the table so much that we couldn't  hold a conversation fish tacos were good lunch special was a great value I ordered Mt Gay and coke...and received coke only... I don't think he knows the brands of rum.Lol...but all around fun place good food...affordable...sorry not picture worthy lmao"}
{"text":"Service was great. Our waitress was Courtney. She showed us her favorites and told us all about the menu. First time eating here. Portions were great took half home so that I could enjoy it the next day."}
{"text":"A return to Vegas is not complete without a visit to Bahama Breeze, one of our all time favorite restaurants along with Lee's Roadside Grill in St. Maarten in the Caribbean. 

Last night we had:

Jamaican Jerk Chicken marinated with authentic jerk seasonings and then roasted, served with yellow rice, black beans and ripe plantations.

Chipotle Beef Bowl 

Seafood Paella 
With sauteed scallops, shrimp, fish, mussels,  chicken and chorizo sausage with yellow rice.

Add live music and its a fantastic atmosphere and dinner.

{"text":"Bahama Breeze is amazing for happy hour! The prices are so cheap for both drinks and appetizers. They don't just have happy hour on crappy drinks no one wants, you'll definitely want these drinks! I The appetizers are delicious as well, for a good price. Customer service is also great."}
{"text":"I had a great time. I ordered the paella and it's delicious even though I know I make it great if not better at home. The beef empanadas was slightly greasy but still yummy. The shrimp and crab with the toasted bread was above mediocre. The coconut shrimp was amazing and so was their fried shrimp. The baby back ribs was falling off the bone tender and my 3 year old ate one after another. The jerk chicken taste way better than it looks. The nachos were a classic fave. I know you are reading this and must be like wow this girl eats a lot but FYI I'm pregnant so I have a big appetite. The singer played and sang me Happy Birthday and he sings great music. The waitresses were on point, friendly, and nice. The only thing that could've made this experience better was if my husband was there but I understand he had to work. Someone has to make money but I definitely would go here again and my sister loved it so much she wants to come here on her Birthday. Oh and last but not least the mango beach drink is to die for! Best drink I ever had(non alcoholic)"}
{"text":"I do love Bahama Breeze even if it is a bit of a walk from the Main Strip, Its a Caribbean Style Restaurant which just looks like you've stepped into the Caribbean in Las Vegas, All the staff are really friendly and willing to help, We went on a Sunday evening when it was happy hour 9pm until close they also have it Monday through till Friday from 4pm-6pm and Sunday through to Thursday 9pm until close, I had a 20z Beer in an iced cold glass for $3!!!! They have a great selection of beers and cocktails in the happy hour! No wonder this place was soooo busy! They also have a great selection of appetisers half price so we choose the massive Crispy Onion rings! they were huge and so tasty!!! For the mains i had the Jerk Chicken pasta which was good!!! And my partner had the one of the Burgers which was also huge! The portions here are not small so come on a empty stomachl!! The whole place was buzzing and had a great feel to the place and it was nice to escape from the Strip for a while, They also have live entertainment on some nights including some great Reggae and Caribbean tunes so you can just pretend youre in the Caribbean. If youre planning on taking a visit here  from the Strip i would recommend taking a taxi as it is a bit of a walk and the area can be a little sketchy."}
{"text":"I love steak so I'm always looking to try some new flavor to my steak, the sirloin I had at bahama was good and cooked true to order (I prefer my steak medium, and it was). The shrimp salsa was also quite delicious :)"}
{"text":"Good food, slow service.  The ribs were not as good as the 1st time we were here. After the food was served the wait staff was more attentive.  The store was pretty empty for a Friday night."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I visit the Bahama Breeze. A very good casual restaurant with decent food and good service. This time, I actually get to write a review and it is quite a pleasant one. Ordered a Cubano sandwich that came with fries and lots of ham and sauces that the sandwich had. A very substantial portion, by the way. Will definitely bring more people to this place as it does deliver the Bahama Breeze experience."}
{"text":"Here we go again! 
First impressions last a lifetime. Upon entering I was told my party of 3 would have a 15 to 20 minute wait time. One third of the tables were empty and there were employees everywhere standing around doing nothing. I am not a fan of open kitchens, i watched several employees  goofing around, pushing and shoving in the food prep and line area. I went to use the rest room during my wait. Filthy and unkempt,  this is typically a bad sign in any restaurant, they definitely do not have a daily cleaning regime. After being seated at a dirty table I had look at menu, very predictable.  No thank you. Our waitress had an afro the size of a beach ball, I thought we had health codes regarding hair in food service industries in Pennsylvania. I guess they wanted me to feel like I was in the Bahamas. I don't like eating human hair, I opted just to have a cup of coffee, acceptable at best. My wife got some seafood dish that resembled a bad idea. My daughter got pre packaged frozen chicken and stale tasting frozen fries. Well once again I am focusing on the bad, but when you are slapped in the face with it, you get my point. This place is nothing more than fast food. I just can't figure out how the bar got lowered so low. It's just embarrassing.  I am always expected to give my best performance at my job, no less. Why have we become so accepting of pre packaged, mediocre, lack luster, lazy, dirty and ect. These chain restaurants are disgraceful and when the ownership and their staff don't get it right the first time, I will not ever be back.
Thanks for your time."}
{"text":"what a great place!  it has everything...tropical atmosphere, reasonable prices, fantastic menu with super good food.  nice selection of exotic tropical cocktails. we tried hard to find a blemish during our visit, and found ourselves planning our next repeat visit to try other menu items. it was like being back in Key West again."}
{"text":"The breeze is cool. Not too fancy. The drinks are a little watery but the grub is decent."}
{"text":"I came in here the other night because I wanted to try Caribbean food for the first time. I was lost looking at the menu because everything looked so good. Tamikah was my server and seemed to know exactly what I was looking for. She suggested the key West nachos and I swear she read my mind. Then she told me it was happy hour and that the food was discounted so I decided to get a drink she suggested an ultimate piña colada I thought it was too girly but she insisted it would be great. I ordered it and it was so strong very good. I was so happy with her passion and knowledge of the food and restaurant in general. This girl deserves and award with the way she treated me and my family. I will be a regular here from now on. Thank you tamikah for a great experience."}
{"text":"I had a very horrible online ordering experience it was horrible I placed my order on line on 01/11/17 to be picked up on 06/18/17 order was not ready you have to stand in the area of waiters and waitresses trying to get clients their order so it excuse me u jumping around like a idiot they should a area for pickup of orders not in area where they trying to seat people! They had 1 person trying to find our orders I wasn't the only one waiting finally got my food and it was put in the bag so that when I got home it was cold and the sauce was in the bag all I can say is won't do that again! Beware of online ordering with Bahama Breeze people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!













Thank you for space to vent!!!"}
{"text":"Aww SNAP, go visit LUIS at the outside bar.  

Yep, that's how I'm starting this review.  So, me and some friends were looking to have a GREAT margarita since it was Cinco De Mayo (you know being in the spirit of the 'holiday'.  We found ourselves at Bahama Breeze, to to grab a drink or two and listen to the band.  I'm glad we went, it's always the nights that are NOT planned that you have the MOST fun.

We seat ourselves at the outside bar, there was an island band playing that night.  FYI: There's a live band every Friday...ok, so at the bar get the menu and see that they have a special for the night $5 Margaritas (Mango, Classic, Strawberry and 2 other flavors).  6 Margaritas and a chicken quesadilla later we were SAUCED and that's when the night got live.  The band was cool, it was a Caribbean themed band that week.  

This review is not about the food or the band, even though BOTH were great, this review is about the BARTENDER LUIS @ the outside.  Out of this world customer service, he was definitely in charge of his bar that night.  Not only assisting in making the drinks for the servers, he still maintained a great quality of service that he provided to us at the bar.  Very attentive to all, even took a moment to crack a joke or two with the folks at the bar.  I LOVE service like this, it makes me come back on the regular.  I will definitely be back soon, no need to wait for the hostess to seat, I walking straight to the outside bar to go hang with LUIS!

Go visit him, he's really cool.  I promise this is not personal review, I did not know Luis until last week.  Good thing I was looking for a great margarita because I found one and it was accompanied by an AWESOME person/bartender."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Happy Hour! Great drinks and appetizers with friends that will not break you if you are budgeting. The server and bartenders are fun as well. A lot of my friend who come to visit are jealous because many of the Bahama Breezes don't have this type of happy hour or has closed. I also love the burger for lunchtime. Nice and juicy.

Daytime Happy Hour is Monday - Thursday, 4pm-6pm
Late Night Happy Hour is Sunday - Thursday 9pm-Close"}
{"text":"Me & 3 other friends come to celebrate one of my friend's birthday. We order their nachos, shrimp (scampy like) in lite dishes, coconut shrimp plate, jerk chicken. The plate comes with rice, black beans & fried banana. Sit Inside more quite than cover patio (they have live music), next time I like to sit inside because outside by cover patio to much fan at the ceilling and make my food get cold faster. We all like our food
We got fun server but  I forgot his name."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelpers we had a very good experience at this funky place.  I was sold on the mixed drink pics (didn't have one).  
I did have the most delicious black bean soup (Cuban style) and so tasty.  
I also had the lobster and shrimp quesadilla which was very good.  I did share and every one said it was their fave.  
The service was excellent and the
Bathrooms were very cute ... 
I would love to return here.  Good food good service and cute atmosphere... winning combo"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant- so much that I had my bachelorette party there. I love the atmosphere (the decor is tropical), the food is excellent, and the caribbean music (free entertainment) adds to the overall fun feel of this restaurant. It's easy to feel good in this type of restaurant. I've only been here for dinner, but about ten times. (Twice for an e-mail member event- that was fun!) The service is really good. The location (Paradise/Flamingo) is in \"Restaurant Row.\" It's very easy to get there from the Strip, if you are just visiting. If you're coming for dinner, make a reservation, because this is a very popular restaurant. Outside seating is nice, if you can stand the heat during the summer months.  

My favorite appetizer is the Coconut Shrimp. It's now the best all around in Las Vegas, since Red Lobster's version has changed. I don't like a whole lot of breading- like how they do so often at chinese restaurants. It's definitely not the case here. Also, the size of the shrimp is pretty good.  

My favorite dish here is the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta. I am not usually a fan of creamy sauces, but I make the exception here. It is the perfect blend of bowtie pasta, jerk chicken (love that spice combination), mushrooms, and asparagus. It's the best thing on the menu. But that's my opinion. I've tried other things on the menu but I keep coming back to this dish. 

About the prices, it's a chain restaurant, so the prices are going to be slightly higher than some restaurants out there. Frankly, I didn't think that the Planet Hollywood restaurants are anything special, but they still remain popular today for some reason. I would rather go to Hard Rock Cafe, but now, my husband doesn't think those restaurants are anything special either.        

SInce I love this place, I am sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5

I love this environment. Great bahama drinks, great food, great live music! They use to have one in Oklahoma City but it closed down. Now the only time I can enjoy it is when I visit Vegas! Service was slightly slow, but the bartender was pretty good when we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Never been here before, but I had a gift certificate. My daughter & I came. We started out with ultimate pineapple drink. Yum!! Ordered spinach dip. Super yummy.  Then dinner. We both ordered the tenderloin pork with sweet potatoes. It came and my daughter is allergic to mango. We thought we read it carefully. It said nothing about the pineapple salsa, which had mango.  Our server (Travis) was awesome he took it away & made her a new one without salsa. Will definitely look for another Bahama Breeze near us. Great job."}
{"text":"I ordered a dish a specific way, which came out incorrect the first time. The second time the dish wasn't cooked all the way, which I had sent back. Before the dish was brought out correctly the manager came over (with a slight attitude) to ask what the problem was, and after he explained he pretty much made excuses and admitted that certain foods weren't made fresh and authentic to any Caribbean way. The whole conversation was unnecessary for him to come over defensive, I didn't ask for any dishes to be compt just made right. 

I will drink at bahama breeze occasionally and eat light appetizers, but not certain dishes."}
{"text":"The fresh Almond crusted Red Fish was delicious and light, try it wood grilled! Oh and the conch fritters were a great choice.. Crispy and moist."}
{"text":"I really had very high expectations for this place when I first found out we were attending a wedding reception dinner here. I have had great authentic food on the islands so I was excited about Bahama Breeze ( island grille ). Well I would like to say it is more like an American breeze with a Bahama inspiration. But after getting over the fact there is really no authentic food here this place is pretty good. We had a party of around 30 and were seated privately in a covered patio section of restaurant. This place is huge, nice and spacious. Seemed like everyone really enjoyed their drinks, I had the Bahamarita and it was very good. Ok so menu items we tried were beef empanadas: their version is good and the sauces that came with were very good. Coconut shrimp: I have had better but it was good, the sauce to dip was the winner. BBQ ribs: very good like rib joint good, Seafood and jerk pasta I was told was excellent, plenty of shrimp and lobster. The portions here are pretty big too, most guests had to go bags. I found out after the fact from a local that the one authentic item they had was conch fritters, man one of my favorites so can't wait to try them.  Our great, very patient, and very nice waitress Christine informed us about their happy hour, so we will be back since we visit Vegas frequently."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant that takes you away to the islands, even though it's just a chain.  They really train their wait staff to give you the best experience. 

The service at the bar was slow, but that was due to a call off.  When the drinks did come, I was pleasantly surprised. It was the flight of margaritas. The perfect size and taste for an evening of dinning.  

I would come back again and again. The jerk chicken is legit, even if it's not from Jamaica. 

Have you tried the plantains? Yes please! If you're new to this place, don't hesitate on trying the most delicious thing on the menu. 

Don't write off all chains, they aren't created equal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome. Food was great and super fresh and the service was amazing! The bahamarita was out (when we wanted our second round) and they were super quick to comp our second round of something else! Everything is clean and well spaced out."}
{"text":"I will admit that General Mills did a good thing by spinning off its restaurants into Darden Restaurants in the mid 1990's quality and innovativeness has gone up across the board. So I was expecting good things from a chain restaurant.

The chain creates is one of the nicest casual dining ambiances that I have been into lately. The Beech house concept with wrap around porch, live music, fire pits, etc was beautifully done. 

The biggest complaint I had was their Mojito - having lived in Florida for several years I have had many Mojito's and there's was not very good. First of all they get compliments for using spearmint - too many bars use mint, but spearmint is much closer to yerba Buena that is used in Cuba. A true mojito is actually complex drink with sweetness, a slight sourness, and mint. There's was a shallow one-dimensional drink with very little mint. It also appeared that the mine was simply placed in the glass, I could see no crushing (muddling) of the leaves that release the oils for flavor.

The Cuban black bean soup was very good albeit just slightly on the salty side and the West Indies Beef patties were excellent.

I had the Jamiccan grilled chicken breast for my entrée, it was suppose to have jerk seasoning on it but I couldn't taste any. The picture on the website shows 2 chicken breasts and yet my plate only had one on it. The cook who grilled did a very nice job, perfect marks and it was done perfectly, not overcooked one bit. The pineapple mango salsa was pretty  plain and needs some work. Green beans were cooked nicely but greasy. And I really enjoyed the cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes.

For a chain the food was pretty good, however very pricy imho. Would I go back, yes, for convenience, different style of food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tonight I had seafood paella at Bahamas Breeze the scallops were those little ones about the size of a quarter and that alone makes this dish underwhelming. I am not really sure why I thought the seafood would hearty and cooked properly but I did.  
I probably won't be returning but if I did I definitely would try something other than paella."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I checked out the drink menu and was amazed at how many cocktails they have. I was still recovering from the night before of drinking, so I did not order a drink."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.   Staff are clearly overwhelmed.   Appetizers were cold.  Waited about 45 minutes for dinner to be served dinner that was poorly played and average at best.  Friendliness of waitress and design of the place were the only positives for this experience.    Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine. Bahamarita martini is a must and signature drink. It's refreshing with their coconut shrimp pasta. Customer service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Friends of friends have dragged me here twice and twice too many times.  Do yourself a favor and opt for something, ANYTHING else in Cleveland's diverse and lovely foodscape for your dining needs.

Overpriced, mediocre to sub-par dorm-foodesque dishes, very slow service (despite hordes of wait staff milling about), garish decor and vibe, mostly classless clientele.  In short, a fun-filled destination guaranteed to make you lose your boner.  If Sizzler's were your penny-pinching old-school grandpa and Chili's your party-loving, alcoholic cousin, Bahama Breeze would be your cheesy, loud, annoying uncle who constantly cracks painfully unfunny jokes and wears cheap purple Hawaiian shirts that can't button over his gut so he leaves the last three buttons open.

This would have been a 1.5 star review--all 1.5 stars for our very friendly and courteous server second time around who unfortunately, could not redeem all the negatives that made up the rest of the experience, including his much-to-be-asked-for follow-up time on drinks, food, etc.  And the guy even drew crude little bahama seascapes on our to-go containers, for chrissakes.

The only items I've had that could have been categorized as fairly good are the fresh-squeezed lemonade and some of the appetizers (quesadilla and butterfly shrimp).  But then again, if you mess up quesadillas and butterfly shrimp, that basically means you don't know how to operate a toaster oven.

Everyone loves to rave about their signature Jerk Chicken Pasta dish--a palatable but unexceptional mixture of pasta, chicken, a miserly pinch of asparagus bits (more stalk than tips) in a white cream sauce.  I suppose if you were to pick something every time, that'd be a safe bet.

The second time around, I got the Calypso Shrimp Linguine--what a mistake.  Don't be fooled by the menu descriptor's alluring promises of scallions and garlic.  In fact, don't be fooled by their alluring promises of shrimp.  Instead, be prepared for a one-dimensional, salt-flavored pile of pasta swimming in balls of bland, fishy-textured meat molded in the shape of shrimp.  It was as if their shrimp--and there was a huge portion of it--were frozen, defrosted, frozen, and defrosted again to the point that it had almost no shrimp flavor left and only a strange, slightly crunchy texture.

Unless you're a huge fan of consistently subpar-to-mediocre faintly starchy cuisine reminiscent of dorm food and waiting at least 20 minutes to get your drink refilled, the Breeze ain't for you.  However, if you're ever stranded at Bahama Breeze, you'll probably be safe with appetizers and maybe drinks (which run on the strong side; mojitos will disappoint)."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved this place. 6 happy hour appetizers down the gullet loved. Nice atmosphere, we had great service. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"VERY GOOD. I had the jerk shrimp appetizer with the cuban bread and LOVED it. The service was ok, but then again, we had a party of 23 and I dont think they were very well prepared for that. The reason I'm giving 5 stars is because the food was SOOOO good. and the conch frittters; TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"This was my second time around and I ordered the same appetizer as I did the first time because it was so good. 
The crab, shrimp, avocado and mango salsa stack. This is a wonderful glorified shrimp cocktail. Fairly fresh seafood (It means alot for me to say that because I'm from Van where fresh seafood is in abundance and anything but uber fresh is yeck) piled into a lovely cylinder with a generous drizzle of spicy red cocktail sauce on the plate. Perfect combination and balance of flavours in my book. 
As for my main, I ordered the lobster and shrimp linguine. This was alright. Nothing spectacular in terms of flavour, however, the portion was generous. 
I ended up picking off hubby's plate who got salmon with a side of cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes and fried plantains. I ate at least half of his sides! 
I like this place mostly b/c they use alot of fruit flavours such as mango's and bananas in their dishes and well, anything with fruit in it I pretty much love. So needless to say my review on this might be a bit biased based on that fact alone. =) Don't know how Caribbean this place really is as I've only been to the Caribbean itself twice and that was on a cruise ship, so I'll let other more experienced Caribbean food eaters give you a rundown of its authenticity."}
{"text":"I had the very bland fish tacos and my husband had the fried chicken. The service was friendly but the food is was very disappointing, because it didn't have much favor. We asked our server for various sauces trying to add taste to our meal but it didn't improve much. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was very tasty! Dinner and drinks with my mom. Mom was little hesitant at first but they offer a lot on the menu, and our waiter was from Burbank Ca, which I forget his name but he was awesome and very helpful in helping choose dinner. Thank you for good food, good drinks, and  great experience"}
{"text":"After some great visits to this place, this one was a complete bust. I might still be waiting for a server if I didn't grab someone 3 times.
Ordered Long Island teas from the bar and not sure what I got. Waitress could not have been more inattentive.
Luckily my lobster Mac and cheese with plantains didn't disappoint.
I guess I was disappointed because my last visit was so great. I'll be back but they need to fix uneven service problem."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We've come here many times. Great menu and amazing service. Bahama Breeze has the best pina coladas and mojitos. I highly recommend a visit to this place."}
{"text":"They racially profile & call the cops on people WHO HAVENT COMMITTED ANY CRIMES!!!! What the hell is going on? Will be boycotting B.B."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great experience. Hostess was able to seat us quickly on Friday night. Service was quick and delightful. Everything we ate was good. Drinks were tasted good. At the end of the night I thought it was a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"The place really took care of my gluten and dairy intolerances. Service is just excellent. Great ambience for a cozy dinner. Not a crowded place but close to the strip. Good selection of drinks, I got high with just one of their strawberry mojitos. Huge quantities of food too."}
{"text":"Located on Flamingo Blvd, just east of the Las Vegas Strip. Ok so it's a chain, I have no problem with that. This is a great place to take visiting family if you want to avoid the strip. The service is great, the prices good, and food is fun. Oh and they have a great selection of drinks as well. What else do you need? Nothing you say? Good, then stop on by. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for an escape and catch up with my uncle and was very pleasantly surprised. I'd been to a Bahama Breeze near Seattle a couple years ago and it screamed chain. So did this one upon first inspection, but a few things stood out.

First, our waiter was top notch. Friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and even engaged us as we asked about how the local dining businesses were faring in the current economic state. He was actually a PT waiter at another restaurant, and he helped us pick our dishes.

The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the jerk chicken bowtie pasta, which was slightly spicy but in a good way.

Although I might not go actively searching for this place next time I am in Vegas, I would recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably priced, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Work dinners - you want to go somewhere affordable, has something that everyone would like, and have okay food. That's how I feel about Bahama Breeze. Affordable and OK.

Our server was fantastic - bright and bubbly, recommended a handful of items. It took us about 20+ minutes to get ready and order, yet she checked on us ever 5 minutes to answer questions.

I personally got the Jerk Chicken, with cinnamon sweet potatoes, green beans and a mango pineapple salsa. I didn't taste much of the jerk seasonings - but then again, the menu DID say \"mild\". The sweet potatoes very very sweet, but it balanced with the salsa and chicken.

One of my co-worker's dish was forgotten by the food runner, so our server came by and said the manager comped the dish and a hot plate would be coming right up. Good service!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is throughout the whole resturant and every appetizer we ordered was better than the last! We had so many we didnt make it to the dinner!  The empanadas and crab stack were amazing loved this place and will  be coming back again tomorrow!."}
{"text":"Ask for layer pina calada 5/5* eating with coconut shrimps  5/5* and watching final FIFA world cup. Nothing else us better than this!! Germany vs Argentina 1-0.. Goal....."}
{"text":"I find the food to be simply overrated. Service is okay. The table was sticky. This would be my first and last time to eat at this place."}
{"text":"For anyone who takes the time to read my reviews, you know I'm critical and somewhat unforgiving.  That being said,  Bahama Breeze knocked my socks off. We started with the beef empanadas, then I ordered the chipotle beef bowl and hubster ordered ribs with garlic mashed taters.  The app was flavorful and so delicious. I had agreed to get the full order beef bowl to share, but, after I tasted it,  I wanted to protect it like the last package of Twinkies in a zombie apocalypse. Hubby loved on his ribs while I shielded my bowl from his wandering fork.  There's no room for dessert, but, my flashy green drink was good,  too. Our waiter was attentive and the water was flowing. Thank you,  BB, this meal was such a pleasant, last minute surprise.   Mwah!  Hugs and kisses....till we meet again."}
{"text":"Is there a new chef or new recipe for classic dishes? I LOVE this place but the food tasted different. I usually order the jerk chicken pasta and it is good but the oder from 4/29/17 was different. It wasn't very good, it was greasy too. I love the leftover portion for later but this time it wasn't good.  I don't know what's going on but if it wasn't broken, don't tweak it!"}
{"text":"Somehow being in a Caribbean themed restaurant in Las Vegas just didn't feel so out of place as the entire town is full of make-believes.

On a whim, a colleague loved this place so introduced this restaurant to us so we came here and tried several dishes. The place felt lively, yet relaxing. I particularly liked my virgin ultimate pineapple drink -  essentially piña colada and strawberry ice in a freshly cut pineapple without the alcohol. It's so refreshing & satisfying! The Jamaican chicken was just okay and the portion was plentiful.  the waiter was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and conversations.

Another reason to dine here is that it's pretty close to the strip, has plenty of parking and easy to hail a cab or get rideshare to and fro.

I would definitely return if in a mood of something different and tropical in Vegas."}
{"text":"My parents love Bahama Breeze so if I go out to dinner with them this is usually where we end up. I'm not big on chain restaurants but this one gets my seal of approval! We always do the call ahead seating which is great because usually the wait is 45+ minutes around dinnertime on a weekend night.  My mother has a shellfish allergy so when with them we usually start off with the chicken tostones-very similar to nachos except instead of chips, it's fried plantains. Very tasty! When not dining with my parents, I like to start with one of the shrimp apps. Personally, the coconut shrimp is my favorite (and I'm not a fan of coconut except on shrimp). I also like the skillet simmered shrimp which comes with bread to sop up the juices. The firecracker shrimp comes with a spicy red pepper sauce and is good as well. For entrees, I almost always order the wood-grilled tilapia off of the fresh fish menu, mango glazed with grilled pineapple salsa. It's delicious! My parents usually do the same style but with salmon. Also the key west fish tacos are a good  choice. As for drinks, I always,always order a frozen bahamarita (tequila, and kiwi,strawberry,and mango ices). My favorite reason for coming here,believe it or not, is for dessert. I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE the chocolate island and I would seriously come here for just that!  It's rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie Island in milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. It is hands down the best dessert I have ever had in a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food - service could be a little bit better - but they have great food! 
I had the Shrimp, avocado and crab tower and it was delicious! 
Nice place in Vegas that is off the strip and a nice place to eat when in town for business purposes..."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Always a pleasure to eat here.  Staff are very friendly and quick on service. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Me and my wife have been here several times and we have not been disappointed once. If you get a chance sit at the bar and ask for Doug he is very knowledgeable, fun, and can tell he really enjoys helping the customer with making decisions on food and drinks.  I must say every time we have come in and he is here Doug hasn't let us down with his recommendations so kudos to him. Great place keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"i havent had bahama breeze in like 6 years, but my fiances cousin had her wedding reception there and their food was definetly better than the last time i had it. the DRINKS too. delicious!!! I had a jerk chciken pasta which was bomb i also had a strawberry margarita and a flight but cant remebr the names of the drinks, but they all were good and there was no holding back on the alcohol. the waiters and waitresses that served us were really polite and attending so thank you all for a good time and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place off The strip. Fab happy hour on weekdays from 9 to closing with half Price delicious appetizers ( Coconut shrimp and onion rings favorites but all was good) bbq baby ribs also a good choice to share ( large portions). Cocktails hit The spot at 3-4$ happy hour. Been a few years back and came back twice this time."}
{"text":"food is ok.
Specialty drinks are better."}
{"text":"The best coconut shrimp wish the had one in Ca. The place is big the service is great. When I'm in Vegas this is where I eat."}
{"text":"Last month was my first time checking out their happy hour. & let me just say.. amazing!! Great prices on great drinks and food. Bahamaritas are my favorite. A must try! The sangria was ok.. not the best, but hey I drank it anyway. I also got a Blue Moon which I love. As far as food goes, we ordered most of the happy hour menu. Lots of food! The only reason I'm giving them four stars is because the service was pretty slow. It took foreeeever to get the check and then even longer to pay. But overall, very nice happy hour experience. I've been many times not during happy hour and I always get the jerk chicken pasta. It's soooo good!"}
{"text":"Good location away from the middle of the strip. Ample parking. Went with a large group and was seated in the outside patio. Had a fire going and there was live music. The atmosphere was very nice. 

The waiter took our drink order right away. Great selection of fancy drinks. 

I had the Coconut Shrimp with extra broc instead of the rice. The Coconut Shrimp was outstanding. It came with 7 very large Shrimp and I could not eat them all.  Would be plenty large to split with someone else. It came with a salad that was good but nothing special. 

The rest of my table had the Chicken that was served with mashed potatoes and corn. They all said it was very good. The serving was enormous and easily could be shared. 

Overall a very good experience. I would eat here again. The atmosphere is casual, the service is good and efficient and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner when we arrived late before Thanksgiving. The food was just fine and the customer service was on point but I cannot recommend the drinks. Honestly, not really picky but the margaritas were really really sour- and I love a dry drink. Ordered a different kind after the first one to see if it was more balanced and was just as sour. Did not finish it."}
{"text":"Great for a laid back Sunday afternoon lunch!  The staff was friendly,  the food arrived quickly and hot. The atmosphere was great,  chill for an afternoon margita (Sunday,  1pm) with no waiting for seating.  Our Waiter was Gerald,  I think.  He had some good suggestions and a great attitude.  Lunch special was good (Mahi mahi).  I suggest adding the $2.5 side salad,  a great value.  Margarita was a little on the sour side (many near the strip have been to me) not too weak though : ).  Will keep this place on the laid back weekend afternoon selection."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for over two years and the food has retained its quality as well as the professionalism of staff. The food is still great and I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Management sucks! Manager placed me on hold for over 15 minutes. Never ever going here and I will never recommend it. 
2 thumbs DOWN!"}
{"text":"Everyone's food was excellent. I had the salmon with some kind of fruit salsa and it was cooked perfectly. Server was friendly and attentive. Restrooms are always clean. I've had some other dishes here in the past and can't recall ever having a bad meal or experience"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas, we come...  Delicious Food... Great service and the cocktail's very creative ;)))))"}
{"text":"Great place if your ready to get off the strip, reasonable prices and the service is top notch, the atmosphere is great. Our server Josh was superb, full of fun and knowledge about the menu. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for a company Christmas party, so I understand the service and food might not be as it would for say 2-4 people... With that said....

Appetizers were cheap: Chicken quesadilla was just bland, edaname was good but c'mon. Fun, but cheap.
Same thing goes for the meals. I had the fish tacos, TERRIBLY FISHY. I'm a HUGE fan of Wahoo's, so this was such a disappointment. My husband had the cuban, I had a bite of it and the bread was grilled and pressed, but tasted so dried out.

The drinks were amazing though, for that it gets 2 stars. =o)"}
{"text":"Tina and the assistant manager were awesome! They took care of my gluten free diet and served a tasty  meal. Tina was very attentive, personable and just so much fun! She even brought a bag of ice for our friend's knee. Our guests loved their meals and cocktails too. Even though BB is a chain restaurant, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"If you want a taste of the Caribbean in your mouth, Bahama Breeze is the place to go. Very friendly staff and a fantastic menu to choose from"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite chain restaurants. Ever since I discovered the jerk chicken pasta dish years ago I have been hooked. I've tried making the recipe myself using recipes found online and nothing ever compares to theirs. If you've never tried it I highly recommend you give it a try. The chicken is cooked perfectly, the sauce is the perfect amount of spice, and the asparagus and mushrooms are a great addition to the dish.

On top of that this place has delicious drinks. This time around we went with the jalapeño watermelon margaritas and it was so good that we ordered a second pitcher. The ambience of this restaurant is always delightful as well. Even on a wet rainy day you can go here and feel like you are off on a vacation."}
{"text":"I love place! The first time was many years ago, where I had seafood paella for the very first time. I think that dish made this restaurant memorable, plus the island decor. I think I had a mojito, which was strong, and I couldn't finish it. I don't go to Las Vegas very often, but when I do, this place was always in the back of my mind, and I do get a little sad when we don't get to go eat there. Service had been great for the times we went. We even brought kids with us one time, and they enjoyed the food. I'll be waiting for the next trip to Sin City, and soon so I can use the coupon they sent me by email."}
{"text":"After a late show on the Strip we headed over to Bahama Breeze for an even later Happy Hour.  Happy is the key word:  I was happy that they're open till midnight, happy at the extensive food menu available, and happiest at the triple-flavor Frozen Bahamarita available for 4 bucks.

Having been to a Yelp event at the one in Princeton, NJ, I was pretty familiar with the menu choices.  But I hadn't tried the tostones with chicken, which our waiter recommended.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The large, thick plaintain slices were covered with an impressive amount of chicken, cheese, and other goodies.  Think nachos on speed.

My husband, the non-seafood-eater, let me talk him into the Lobster and Shrimp quesadilla, which came with pico de gallo, sour cream and, I think, guacamole (though that may have been with the tostones.  One Bahamarita is all it takes for me!).

Service was great, the food was delicious, and paying half price was the best of all."}
{"text":"I stayed next door at the Hampton Inn & Suites for three nights during the week.  I ended up at Bahama Breeze on two occasions.  Once was for lunch.  The restaurant is HUGE but not overly noisy when busy, and the design of the restaurant is very appealing, giving you a hint of the islands.  The staff was really friendly especially my waiter, Cory.  He was extremely outgoing and went out of his way to make sure everything was to my satisfaction even though I was only having a salad and a lemonade.  By the way, their lemonade is excellent!  However, I couldn't give them more than two stars as I took an associate there for the late night happy hour a day later and the place seemed to have done a complete 180.  The staff looked like they had been put through the wringer!  Not a single one of them looked happy to be there, no smiles, no pleasantries, nothing, except for Cory, or course, who was still wisking around with a smile on his face!  The food and drinks were OK, nothing special.  The worst was the BATHROOM! It looked like nobody had come in to clean all day.  Paper towels were overflowing the trash and scattered all over the floor.  A fowl odor emanated, stains on the floor and walls, and the sink hardware looked like it had seen much better days.  Oh boy, this place gave me high hopes at first but it let me down.  I let the hotel staff know as well so they think twice about sending guest over there, especially during happy hours!"}
{"text":"We were starving when we left the Atomic Testing Museum. I suggested Bahama Breeze because it was conveniently close and their Coconut shrimp was beckoning me! I also love their dessert drinks. 

I feel like I'm on a mini vacation when I come in here. Maybe it's the Banana Strawberry Daiquiri that puts me in the mood. The sips I took were fantastic ! My husband didn't like his Sangria (they don't serve it with fruit in the glass) so he drank half of my Daiquiri. My sister in law who is the \"non drinker\" wanted to taste it so I let her. 

 I started with the Coconut Shrimp ($9.49) for an appetizer it is big enough to be the whole meal. I just love the Citrus Mustard sauce it is served with...it's addicting! My sister in law shared her Roasted Cuban Bread ($5.99) . It had sliced vine tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan cheese. It was good ...It think it would be nice to eat with a salad. 

My main entree was the Calypso Shrimp Linguine ($13.99 lighter portion). I'm glad I ordered the lighter version because it tasted okay but it was nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit bland to and I would not order it again. 

We ended the dinner by ordering two desserts to share with the table. We had the Chocolate Island which is a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie swimming in milk chocolate and vanilla bean anglaise. This was my favorite of the two! The second dessert was Banana Nut Supreme it has sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream topped with butterscotch brandy sauce. It tasted okay but everyone at the table liked the Chocolate Island the best! 

This is a nice place to unwind after work because they also have a Happy Hour menu!"}
{"text":"I was here with my friends about a month ago, and the atmosphere is very nice. I had a shrimp pasta with a pina colada and my friends enjoyed their entrees and appetizers. The pina colada was very dark rummy and alchoholish so if you like to taste the alcohol in your drink, this place is for you. That is not my preference. My shrimp pasta was very good. :) And this place has minute maid limeade :) and the server was very nice."}
{"text":"I met a friend here during their happy hour. Very pleased with the variety of items, service was very good and the price was very reasonable. We had three appetizers and a split a nice dessert. The server was attentive and friendly. Another staffer stopped by and asked how everything was a very nice touch."}
{"text":"My first BB visit was down in Tampa Bay, FL, where I was impressed with the decent food items and the margaritas. So I was sure glad to find one in Vegas while roaming around for a supermarket. 

Eh, who am i kdding. Come here for the kickass margaritas, then take a taxi to the strip to party!"}
{"text":"Literally had bugs in my salad not once but twice! They did apologize both times and were just as surprised and weirded out as I was. Let's just say the second salad I trusted them and ate half the salad then boom a bug the same kind on my fork!! Only reason for two stars is because the manager and our server were great, clearly the kitchen needs to get it together! Asap...  at your foods smh."}
{"text":"The manager was very accommodating.  We arrived later than our reservation but were still seated in a comfortable booth.  This is very surprising for a Friday night.  
We ordered just about every appetizer on the menu.  Hands down, the jerk chicken wings, with the perfect blend of seasoning and crispness, are the best item on the appetizer menu.  I also enjoyed the empanadas as well as the crab and shrimp stack.

Unfortunately we were too stuffed to order a dessert....maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Doesn't matter what you order. 

They aren't playing around here! Happy hour on point and the drinks are strong! 

YEEEEE!! :)"}
{"text":"Nice Find!

We just happened on this restaurant during the lunch hour while taking a walk (far off the strip near our hotel). It has a Jamaican theme to most of its dishes. I had coconut shrimp that was to die for (though only four, needed at least two more) and the house salad with the house dressing (very fancy, delicious salad). My companion had a jerk chicken sandwich and soup (can't remember what kind) he said was good. Lovely atmosphere (played island music) and nice wait staff. Lots of rum specialty drinks in the offerings, but since it was 90 degrees and we had to walk a bit, we didn't indulge. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"my husband and I come here every time we r in Vegas. delicious food. great live music. friendly and attentive staff. always a favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"It's okay.  Nothing to write home about.  My classic house margarita tastes like orange juice (and I'm not talking Triple sec).  Kinda odd.  Cool atmosphere though."}
{"text":"The portions are huge! Ambience is nice and casual. 
Had a Spicy Mango Mojito minus the sugar cane juice, and it was very good and plenty sweet. 
We ordered the Firecracker Shrimp which was delish!!!!  About 15 shrimp very lightly breaded with Shiracha Mayo drizzled on top and a small bowl on the side. The mayo was so good we used it on everything after this course!  
Then we had the Jerk Chicken Pasta with a side Caesars salad and the Island Hopper appetizer as a meal. 
The pasta was loaded with asparagus and mushroom with some chicken all cooked well.  The light portion was huge, so no need for the regular portion.  
The side salad was fresh and tasty, but absolutely too big. 
The Hopper was tasty with great coconut shrimp, huge crispy jerk wings, big onion ring and conch fritters.  WAY too much food!!  Everything was good, but the 3 sauces on the platter can't hold a candle to the Shiracha mayo! 
Would definitely return here, but wait for happy hour to get 1/2 off appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"So, I finally tried Bahama Breeze for the first time this past weekend  and it was \"Off da Hook\"!!!

My father kept telling me about this place when he's in town.  I came with my entire family (20+ members) while vacationing in Las Vegas.  They booked us a private room and the service was very helpful and friendly.

We all ordered the Bahamian Seafood Chowder (recommended by my dad and now I recommend it to you), it's a Seafood Chowder w/Fried Shrimp on top.  We also tried the Coconut Shrimp, West Indies Beef Patties (curry empanada, Simmered Jerk Shrimp (soooo gooood!!!) with a warm roll and the West Indies Ribs (huge slab and the best I ever had!)"}
{"text":"Good food and a pretty friendly staff, but they were very aggressive about asking us over and over again if we were ready to order. We had our own server as well as another server who didn't seem t to like the pace at which we read the menu and made our choices. Good restaurant, but the service was a little too corporate and too focused on turning our table around, rather than on hosting a good meal."}
{"text":"I always love going here with friends for fun and yummy food and great island cocktail concoctions!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 14 visiting this restaurant for graduation, and had mixed results on the food reviews. The rice bowl had everything great-except the rice! While A beautiful golden color-it lacked flavor and consistency. Also, likely due to our large party and it being Saturday night, it took us an hour before someone came for a food order, although they were happy to get drinks."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night to relax and take advantage of their happy hour special. The environment is pretty cool. We sat in the patio area where there was a live musician playing reggae classics, very enjoyable. 

I ordered the habanero wings and a classic margarita. The wings did not seem to be habanero. More of spicy BBQ sauce rather than habanero. They were actually pretty good, but calling them habanero is very misleading. For the drinks, it appears the other reviewers are correct. They are either watered down, or have barely and alcohol in them at all. My classic margarita tasted like pure lime mix. I had to order a beer instead. Be cautious of that before ordering. 

All in all, I would give this place a second try again. :)"}
{"text":"We love the appetizers (especially the Mahi-Mahi stack) and all of the great dishes and beverages that we've gotten there. Great atmosphere, too! We love this place so much that my husband and I have picked this restaurant to celebrate my birthday tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've literally drove past this restaurant so many times and finally had the chance to stop by. My friend was in town for her bday and wanted to hit up their late night happy hour, 9 pm to close. The specials were great.. $5 drinks and half off apps. I also loved the decor of this place. It's a bit corny, but overall tropical fun. It sort of reminded me of Margaritaville. 

As for the food my boo and I ended up sharing the fire cracker shrimp and shrimp and lobster quesadilla. Both were very tasty and especially great for such a cheap price. My favorite though was the fire cracker shrimp, it essentially was fried shrimp with a siracha Mayo dipping sauce. I'm sure it's very unhealthy, but so so good. 

Can't wait to come back here again for another happy hour. My only wish is they open another location closer to the west side of town."}
{"text":"I love the Jamaican jerk wings and butterfly shrimp. Happy hour is pretty much the only time I go there but it's the best time . You can sit at the bar and try a mojito, the bartenders are friendly the hostess are ok too. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bahama Breeze a total of 3 visits and the food has been consistently decent. I would have given them another star but during my last 2 visits, I was completely ignored and had to flag or get up & find a waiter to request service after being seated over 15 minutes. WTH?!! This occurred in the dinning area & at the bar. Once I did get their attention, their service was attentive & on-point. 

They have a great Happy-Hour going on twice a day. Half price appetizers and beer & well drink specials. I recommend the coconut fried shrimp, the firecracker shrimp tacos, and the chicken wings. The beef empanadas are good but can be a bit heavy if you eat more than two. They have great margaritas also. Not too sweet and taste like fresh squeezed lime...very refreshing. I will continue to return. Good bar food with a \"tropical\" twist at decent prices. Hopefully, I will not be ignored when I sit at the bar or table next time!!!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place for quite some time and have always thought it some regular chain joint... well I was so wrong. Great food from the island (and I've spent a lot of time on the islands). Super impressed with its authenticity and the service was outstanding ! Well done Bahama Breeze"}
{"text":"Came here for a a last minute dinner.  The waiter was very funny and nice."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and never was the biggest fan, but I will laud Bahama Breeze on my experience today: my friend Susan D. dropped her business card in while at lunch a few weeks ago and won a free happy hour party for 10 people (drinks we had to buy at happy hour prices, which is $3-$4) but it included all sorts of appetizers...and it was seemingly unlimited...for TWO HOURS!  Happy hour is 4-6 PM Monday through Friday, and there are lots of drinks but it looked like only 5 or so choices for apps.  Well, our bartender Melissa hooked it up with more than that and even though there were only 5 of us, she furnished a second round of our faves and almost ordered a third round...of FOOD...and we had to turn her down!

To drink I had the bahamarita, with strawberry, kiwi and mango slush and margarita on top with a side shot of cactus schnapps...interesting and almost like alcoholic jamba juice.  I tried a variety of apps (beef patties which were really empanadas with creole seasoning, coconut shrimp, spinach dip, chicken wings, and chicken sliders) and they also brought out cheeseburger sliders, chorizo sliders, and pulled pork sliders, none of which I tried.

My conclusion is this: 
1) a good deal for a free meal,
2) the empanadas, shrimp, and wings were good, the dip not so much, and
3) THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG: the chicken sliders tasted like MINI CHICK-FIL-A sandwiches!
I hardly ever eat fried food but I had 4 of these, 2 each round.  Hearty juicy fried white meat chicken, 2 pickle slices, and a tasty bun (that probably has less butter than CFA, a good thing!)

I might die tomorrow but I have to say that after being away from Chick-Fil-A for quite some time, Bahama Breeze solves that craving.  Now if only I can find good waffle fries ever since Caribbean Cooker went out of business.

Moral of this story: Go to Bahama Breeze between 4 and 6, order 1 happy hour priced chicken sliders app and 1 drink for $3 and you will thank me later.  and get Melissa as your bartender, she rocks!"}
{"text":"I go here every time I'm in the Celveland area! Every time I get the coconut shrimp app, a coconut mojito, and either the tropical salad or the mahi bowl.
The mahi bowl has a light coconutty flavor and is not too spicy considering its a curry dish. Well balanced between vegetables, rice, and fish.
Recently i tried the mahi fillet with mango sauce on top since they were some how out of the mahi bowl. And wow- deviating from my usual has never been so good!
My sister in law got the lobster mac and cheese, it was a lobster tail split in half, fry it, and plop it on the plate. She was given both halves of the tail. So amazing! Not being short changed at all!
The new crab shells are delicious! Huge portion! It has a bit of a kick to it, but its amazing.
The firecracker shrimp appetizer is also very good, but the bowl is not entirely filled with shrimp, the bottom is tortilla chips- still a good sized app I would say. It served my party of 4 just fine. The sauce was delectable. 
(now for a list of things I've tried here in the past prior to my recent visit)
The jerk chicken, which was very good, I was very impressed. Huge portion too!
The tuna stack i got one time, was a bit of a let down.
The tropical salad is amazing, the dressing is like no other. big portion and lots of fruit in it!
The fish tacos are pretty good as well, the jicama slaw is a nice addition, it's a good portion size too.
The lobster and shrimp quesadilla I got years ago and it was a bit of a let down compared with what else is offered on the menu.
And I think that rounds out everything I remember off the top of my head. 
It's a great place, reservations online are easy to make, beautiful restaurant inside, fun decor, nice staff. I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Now this place got everything right!

From the outside and again on the inside - the entire place is quite interesting to look at - plenty of really cool spots to grab something to eat or just have a cold beer or an incredible specialty drink!

The sitting areas are numerous and the menu is extensive, but no overwhelming. The prices are reasonable until you taste the food and then you realize the prices are incredible - well within our company policy. They also except credit cards!

I'm not sure how \"kid friendly\" they are, but Renee - our server was on top of her game. She explained everything to us - made an outstanding recommendation and was right there with refills!

There were two things I must comment on that prevented them from a 5 star - they were out of two different beers my colleague asked for and the head radiating from above cooked our head while my feet remained cold. Otherwise - this place was awesome!

BTW - I had the steak, which was cooked perfectly - side of amazing mashed potatoes and stemmed broccoli that was cooked just right as well. Renee added some freshly ground Romano cheese to the broccoli that just added the right touch. ALSO - the house salad is a must try - best tasting salad I've had in a long time and remember - TOM HATES SALAD so when I like it - it's not just different - it's GREAT!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the customer service but the food just brought I  down to two.. we all go to restaurants for the food, not the workers so I have to be super honest. The food has gone downhill since the last time I've eaten here. Menu looks FABULOUS, great photos, but the food tasted freezer burn/from a box and bland. Very unexpected and disappointing. I literally lost my appetite after trying my dish, it was a rice bowl with mahi and shrimp. So NASTY! I recommend the chicken quesadilla instead, those are tasty. The environment was nice but out dated, I feel it is due for a remodel. When we sat down the dining room was very hot, I noticed many people outside on the patio but I prefer eating indoors. It seemed like they turned off the AC since customers weren't sitting inside(weird). I would give it a try again but stay inside my box and only order items that are safe and hard to ruin. The cocktails and drinks looked great."}
{"text":"Drinks were good. Food was overrated and over priced. I really do not understand the raving reviews regarding the shrimp and lobster quesadilla. Mediocre is being generous.
Firecracker shrimp was decent. Not sure if I will return based on the food. Outside enclosed patio area is super cute though."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I had a good time. The atmosphere of this place really sets the mood for a laid back time. But every time I have had food her it blows. There is just nothing special about it that draws me back. To me this place is more of a place to get tootie-fruity drinks and some dip. Then it would be for an actual meal. It's almost like an upscale TGIF with bad food. 

The waiters that helped us were quite helpful and were prompt. The place is clean and I had a good time. There food is just not my thing I guess."}
{"text":"The food is good here. Anita is a very nice and attentive server. I would come back forsure."}
{"text":"I got a $50 gift card for my birthday and I haven't been to a Bahama Breeze in ages so I thought I would check this one out. Our server was very very friendly and attentive. Beef empanadas were freaking delicious. I ordered the spicy shrimp I guess it was more of an appetizer so I got a small side salad as well. Salad was very good best part was the croutons. I didn't get that much shrimp unfortunately. If you're looking for a fruity drink try the Bahamarita. Drinks were priced fairly. Dinner for two with a drink and appetizer was about $53."}
{"text":"Great food. Exceptional service!! I have no complaints. We were greeted warmly, sat right near the fireplace (where they seemed to be sitting all the couples) and we had two of the most lively, and nice waitresses. Service was prompt, the menu easy to read, and the portions were HUGE for the price. Loved the guitarist playing live music and it was the perfect getaway for a cold night in Vegas. I've been back twice since my first visit."}
{"text":"i had my wedding reception here. i purchased a food and beverage contract. the booking process was some what painless. the wait staff was very friendly. the food was pretty good. my reason for 3 stars is that it was very apparent the wait staff had been told to slow serve the adult beverages as it took many times to order a beer or glass of wine during my paid for 2 hour drink window. you could absolutely tell they were dragging their feet. piss poor tactic to try and save a buck at a girls wedding reception. shame on you."}
{"text":"Warning!
Our party of 4 was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. After waiting for 20 minutes (no problem. Expected on a Saturday night at a chain restaurant) , we checked in and were told it would be another 45 minutes!  There were many empty tables that were apparently \"closed.\" The hostess seemed shocked we were upset-we could have been informed earlier and made the decision to go elsewhere. 

We wasted valuable time on our way to a performance and ended up having to eat Five Guys in the car. I am beyond disgusted by the incompetence and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Ms. Tina made the visit worth it.  I had shrimp and grits.  I think,  forget I know this is tge best shrimp and grits I've had.  I was pleasantly surprised!!! And did I mention my waitress Ms. Tina.  Best shrimp and grits also there's Ms. TINA."}
{"text":"Setting:  Tropical.  They did a good job with the decorating.  Very nice, very clean.  Nice bathrooms as well.

Food:  The food was great.  I just had an appetizer (yummy habanero wings), and it was big enough for a meal.  The food all around was tasty (tried my friends' dishes as well  :).

Service:  Very happy-go-lucky, especially the person who seated us.  An upbeat group of folks."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but Bahama Breeze was just perfection to me. For a chain restaurant the food was really good and our server (Steven/Stephen) was awesome. He represented the food and company very well. 

I have ate at many places on the strip and Bahama Breeze far exceeded them. 
My only suggestion/complaint is that they update their logo and the color of their restaurant. It blends too much and can easily be passed over."}
{"text":"we have been visiting Las Vegas for a few years now and many times have driven by this restaurant always saying \"we have to come here one of these days\" as it looks very inviting because of its tropical flare and never doing it. We are so glad that we did it on this visit.  we were sat out in the gazebo area which added a nice touch to the evening.  Daniel was our server who tended to us with a great smile all evening long. His recommendations were on point! My wife and I had the Jerk chicken with the bow tie pasta mushrooms and asparagus in a very delicious creamy sauce. Our daughter had the Jamaican Jerk chicken with ripe plantains rice and black beans; she was in heaven and ditch the fork in order to enjoy the chicken to the fullest. Grandma had the grilled chicken sandwich which she reported there were no extra frills so it was just good.  Somehow we managed to have enough room for dessert and are now in a very delighted sureene sugar state of being. Daniel again pointed us in the right direction and we decided to have the banana nut rum bread with caramel sauce and ice cream and the chocolate pineapple upside down lava cake, do I need to say more?   If you are ever in Las Vegas, this is a place that you can not just drive passed."}
{"text":"The food here is OK. Nothing adventurous or ambitious, but prepared well and there are many choices. The reason I give 5 stars is for the excellent service our party received from Tina. She is a sweetheart and a real pro. I won't eat there unless she waits on me. Sorry, she spoiled us."}
{"text":"Had an unexpectedly delicious meal this evening, which hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed.
I went for the Steak Oscar which came with the most amazing dressing/sauce.
Our server, Alexis, was extremely friendly and accommodating and made our experience all the better.
Great value for money.
Can't wait to return for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Happy hour provides great specials so make sure you sign up your email to hear about upcoming events. Staff is friendly. I've not had good luck getting fresh fish (fresh?) but have enjoyed everything else."}
{"text":"I love this place every entree, appetizer and drink is so island tasting and amazing. A must when I'm with friends."}
{"text":"My favorite place to come eat in Vegas! The food is just amazing, can't go wrong with the coconut shrimp tacos. Service and ambience was great loved the classic reggae playing. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I LOVE BAHAMA BREEZE!!!

Bahama Breeze has the BEST margarita's I've ever had!  Mmm, mmm, mmm!  Um, it's triple flavored and sooooooo good!!

I used to go to the Bahama Breeze in Austin, TX all the time (now shut down).  When I moved back to Cali, they didn't have one on the West Coast!  WHAAAAAAAT?  Luckily, they opened this one up in Vegas!!  Not that close to me, but only a 9hr drive or 1hr plane ride!!

Oh yes, I like the coconut shrimp too!  Not all the food items are that good, but the atmosphere is great.  Okay, the atmosphere is not-as-great at the Las Vegas location, but there is no way I can give this place less than 5-stars based on their Margarita's alone!  *yum!*"}
{"text":"Located next to the Marriott Residence Inn. If you're a patron of the hotel, you can get 25% at this restaurant which is why I'm giving this place 4 vs. 3 stars. Cute, chill, island ambiance. Good service. Just missed the mark with the food.
Crabstack- so, the wording \"premium crab\" got me salivating. Sadly, both the shrimp and crab we're tasteless and you can taste that it was probably defrosted as the shrimp was a bit soft. The mango and avocado added to it was the best part. 
Stuffed plantain bowl- we requested adobo chicken instead of beef. Mixed with rice , beans, onion, peppers, mushroom, rice, etc. It had a good flavor, but we could've done without the onions and peppers.
Key lime pie- definitely tart which is why they have a thick layer of meringue on top to offset the tartness which I didn't really care for. I liked the berry and passionfruit(?) Sauces on the side to eat the pie with."}
{"text":"i just love the customization of seafood you can make. how you want it cooked, what sauce, what rub, what sides..it's an amazing restaurant with fantastic environment and great service. top 5 restaurant in vegas to me..along with capriottis and secret pizza at cosmo."}
{"text":"Tried for lunch with my wife. The combination lunch was good 
we both had coconut  Shrimp and soup
The conch chowder was good as well a bean soup

Had been here for drinks and appetizers with a group nice place that time but week service

Today's service was very good"}
{"text":"Love thier empanadas and the best best best paella ever 
I only come about once a year 
But the paella is good"}
{"text":"We had not eaten at Bahama Breeze in many years. It was a hot summer night and anything with the word Breeze in it sounded good. 
We started with two rum flights. We ordered two different kinds so we could try more kinds of drinks. I thought I liked rum but that doesn't seem to be the cases. LOL. The drinks were all tasty and they all tasted differently. It was fun to try them all. 
For dinner I had Shrimp & Grits. Oh My Goodness was it good!  There were a lot of shrimp, the green beans were delicious, but WOW did I like the grits!!!  They were creamy but still had texture to them. There was bacon that gave the dish a touch of saltiness, but not too salty. It also came with mushrooms but I'm not fungi friendly so I asked to leave them off. It was a great dish and I had a happy tummy. 
My husband had the Seafood Paella. It was loaded with seafood such as mussels, scallops, and fish. It had a nice flavor and seasoning. The rice was cooked perfectly. It was a great dish. 
We enjoyed our whole experience-including our service. We will definitely won't wait too long to go back."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception there last week, and the staff there was amazing and accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure my day went smoothly. I ran into a few hiccups during the planning process, but things were always ironed out and fixed quickly. 

The food is OUTSTANDING! My guests ranted and raved about the food, the drinks and the service! 

A big huge thank you to Momi who put up with a briefly stressed out bride during the planning process! 

If you need a contracted event, the staff at Bahama Breeze is able to handle it with attention and professionalism."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying...... their menu is super exciting and the place is very cute! 
That being said their food is awful. 
The quality of the meat is un real. It's not real. Its the shittiest meat imaginable. Same with the seafood and same for the veggies. 
Not only did my mouth not like the food, but my stomache hated it. Everyone I was with felt the same. There is soooo much potential. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is conveniently located on the corner of Flamingo Road and Paradise Road. Keep it in mind that entrance is from Flamingo Road. There are plenty of parking at front of the restaurant.
The building  reminds me of the Caribbean Islands.
Love the posts with fire like effects, the huge beach chairs at the entrance, and the music.

Bahama Breeze is open for lunch and dinner, and it stays open late.
Love the Happy Hour specials, on week nights 4pm-6pm and 9pm till closing. They are offering 50% off appetizers and reduced price beverages!
You have to be lucky to get seated immediately!
This place is very popular with locals and tourists.
When you signed up for a waiting list, you have to provide your phone numbers and then they'll be text you when the table is available for you. Usually it doesn't take long. Host/hostess is always very polite. They are asking you if you were dining here before, remind you to watch where you step up or down ... the restaurant has lots of little stairs all around.
Waiters/waitresses are also very polite, very knowledgeable about their food and drinks.

I'm a kind of person who is always looking at the menu for minutes and then I always get the same items over and over again.
My favorite dinner is the Shrimp and Lobster linguine ... It's a huge portion! Never left dissatisfied or hungry! Perfectly cooked pasta with lots of yummy seafood and creamy sauce. I always ask for freshly grated Parmigiana cheese to add. It really enhances the flavor of the meal.
I also like to add an order of Caesars salad. If you add the salad to the entrée, it only costs $2.99.
My other favorite item is a Seafood Paella. Lots of shrimp and oysters and baked chicken on top of Spanish rice. This meal has lots of flavor! Also a huge portion.

My daughter ordered Lobster and shrimp quesadilla from HH menu. Very tasty appetizer, lots of shrimp and lobster pieces with spinach and cheese on flour tortillas. It is served with very mild salsa and sour cream.
The Coconut Shrimps from HH menu is our other favorite item. It is served with mango salsa, very yummy!

Their specialty cocktails are very well made, always garnished beautifully.
Sometimes I order the Original Cuban Mojito. The only problem I have with this when it is made with way to much ice. I have to ask for a \"less ice\" version of it. 
The Original Lemonade is very good here! It's non-alcoholic, but it's coming from the bar, so it takes forever to get it, sometimes!
Other drinks, like soft drinks or iced tea ... never had a problem to get refills. Service is always good, servers are very attentive.

The restaurant is very casual. Happy to return again and again!"}
{"text":"Jason and Bob at the bar are awesome people. They make you laugh and offer drinks you may like. They made my decision to sit at the bar every time I go to Bahama Breeze."}
{"text":"Place rocks so much food and service was great I will definitely be back here and special drinks they make are wonderful"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to take friends visiting from out of state, since it's near the strip. The food is Caribbean style, so it's something a bit out of the ordinary. I love the jerk chicken pasta! The jerk seasoning is very close to the flavor I have had while in Jamaica. It has a creamy alfredo type sauce with bow tie pasta. They also have amazing cocktails.  The mojitos are deliciously made with fresh fruit. But be careful, these drinks are strong! For the non alcoholic side, try the strawberry lemonade. It comes hand made, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I like their happy hours. I've been there twice recently and I liked their service and food(even we ordered from Happy hour menu..it was very good). I wish they're close to where I live..I would go there more often. Our table server was J.D(usually I don't really remember names but ). He was very friendly and nice. We got our food pretty quick and he took care of everything so quick even they seem so busy. I would definitely recommend this place! Good place for big group."}
{"text":"So I normally love this place when it comes to dinner but I came here for lunch today and I liked everything except the Conch Fritters  

Let me first say that I'm from the Virgin Islands and know what good Conch is... that's when it's actually included in the food. After eating three fritters I decided to open he last two since I didn't taste anything but bread and vegetables.  They were devoid of Conch and it was only tons of filler breading and diced peppers.  

We enjoyed everything else so just stay away from the Faux Conch fritters and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of nice atmosphere. It's kitschy without too much.

I informed the waiter about my allergies to certain weeds (shitlantro) and he recommended a dish for me. Now, I won't die if I get cilantro, but it's kind of unpleasant to my body and it tastes like soap. I got a few bites in and he came running to the table panicking about how the sauce turns out to have cilantro in it. He sent the manager over who recommended a new dish, didn't charge me for either, and then gave me another drink which was hella strong.

The fact that they showed so much concern even though I explained to them that it's not a fatal allergy unless I get a fair amount in me, shows me that they care about their clients. 

The replacement dish, the mahi-mahi in a cream mango sauce, was absolutely to die for. Especially with a strawberry mojito. (the mango one was pretty bad, but was accidentally brought to my table by an errant waitress and I just took it rather than my strawberry one)

Would I go back? Definitely. The food was good, the service was very pleasant, and they apologized profusely for their mistake, while making sure I was very well taken care of. I'd gladly recommend this to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Don't care for this place. Went once, never to return.
Service is blah-"}
{"text":"This. is. my. spot.

I have been here several times and each time is not like the other. In a good way.  I absolutely love coming to Bahama Breeze!

My girls and I frequent this place. We planned a Secret Santa gift exchange and planned to come here. I called ahead of time to see if they can help us remain anonymous with our gifts. They allowed us to bring in our gifts and keep them at the front desk. When the time came, they wheeled all the gifts and handed them out to who they were supposed to go to. So awesome. They made our party fun. 

One lady who works there, I want to say her name is Denise, but I could be wrong. She is great! Every time we're there, she's there and comes to say hi, When we met her, we had found out our friend was moving overseas, so we were upset. Then when we came back for her going away, she was there too and stopped by. She even remembered the night we all had tears in out eyes. 

I love the food here! The firecracker shrimp and jerk shrimp are my favorite. I like my food with a little kick and these deliver. Firecracker shrimp comes with a really good dipping sauce, while the jerk shrimp comes with Cuban bread. Also love their drinks! I get the Frozen Bahamarita. I recently tried the specialty rum drink they had, and got a souvenir glass. 

For my birthday, I had planned on coming here for lunch after some activities. After telling my mom, she later told me that they were going to take me there for dinner! lol they know where to take me, that;s for sure. 

Some nights they have live music, but there are always different parties going on.I really enjoy coming here because the food is good, staff are friendly and I always have a great time coming here."}
{"text":"Friends in town from Australia. Took them to one of our favorite restaurant and everything looked the same, everything sounded the same, but nothing tasted the same. What happened to the Bahama Breeze. The starter, Jerk Shrimp, was a sweet garlic white buttery sauce with a small loaf of bread. What happened. Not the same. Our guest had Pork Medallions and Sweet Potatoes. She also ordered some Shredded Pork. It didn't agree with her. Has Bahama Breeze changed owners or is it just my imagination."}
{"text":"We order the lobster and shrimp quesadillas appetizer, lobster Mac and cheese and salmon. The food is pretty good, except that there's no much shrimp inside the quesadillas, we feel like we are just eating butter bread. Service is good. The black napkin is dirty, I'm surprised that they would give that to customers. The first two gin tonic we got at the bar are good, the third one we got at the table are mainly just tonic water. Overall, it's a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Server Jon D was great, had a lot of helpful information and really knew the menu. Came here expecting good jerk chicken but it was just OK. This place has \"Caribbean influenced\" cuisine. I had the chicken (jerk style) with the roasted corn over potatoes and what i think was a cilantro cream sauce, the dish was very good. I would prefer more of the roasted corn. The combination of the cilantro cream and corn work very well together. The Chicken wings are quite good as well. The food was ok and a star just for the service."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Bahama Breeze.  The whole island theme is kind of tacky, but the food is quite good and this place is a nice break away from the places on the strip.  

My good, ol' standby here is the Bahamian Grilled Kabob, which is fantastic.  

Prices are reasonable (esp. compared to the strip) and the employees have always been friendly.  I definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Recently in the area for an ultimate frisbee tournament, a teammate got this recommendation from their hotel.  We came in with a group of 14 and were surprisingly sat within 10 minutes in this great private room.

The service was friendly and fast, despite the large group we were with.  The atmosphere was fun and friendly - typical of bigger family restaurants.  The food was good; no one at our table seemed to have any complaints about their choices. 

Overall, a decent restaurant.  If you're at one of the hotels in the area and want a good spot for a large group, Bahama Breeze is a decent bet."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded us of another Caribbean style restaurant we enjoyed on the East Coast.

The hostess greeted us right away and there was no wait when we arrived around 5pm on a Sunday. We were looking forward to live music but the musician didn't arrive until we were having dessert.

Service was great. Food was good. The jerk chicken wings and conch fritters came with really good sauces. The chicken adobo street tacos weren't the best. It had a lot of guacamole (I love guac) and it had Crispy tortilla strip at the bottom but there was barely any meat. We ended with a rum cake, which was pretty good. We ordered the Bahamarita cocktail and the sangria. Sangria tasted horrible even after they added more juice to it.

They have a happy hour during the week where they have discounted cocktails and half - off most of their appetizers. We will probably end up going back during happy hour to try the other appetizers."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Jamaican wings are HUGE and the sauce is sweet and yummy. I got the guacamole and goat cheese burger- to die for! I can not wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy, I recommend that your try the skillet simmered jerk shrimp.
It's cooked and served in a hot skillet smothered in butter and herbs and has a nice spiciness to it, but it's not too spicy. It's also served with fresh baked Cuban bread which is great to sop up all the juices with. For an entree, I ordered the baby back ribs which were decent and came with fries. I'll definitely come back just for the jerk shrimp!"}
{"text":"Con: I didn't care for much of their menu selection but I am a picky eater. I got the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, I didn't like it. I thought it was going to be boneless thigh but it was not. I feel like boneless picks up way more flavor and as a result felt like this had no flavor at all. The rice and beans were ok but overall I was disappointed with my selection. It also took a long time to get drinks from the bar...like our food came out quicker than drinks did (alcoholic beverages).

Pros: great ambiance. Clean restaurant, live music, and decent pricing. My husband got shrimp scampi and said it was really good. We had a Carmel cheesecake and that was yummy. Our waiter, Joe, was awesome!  Great personality and really treated us well. Wait time wasn't long at all maybe 5 minutes but we did go on a slow Wednesday. 

In a nutshell: I didn't care for my selection but I would try it again mainly because of how awesome our waiter was."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze sits in the vicinity of corporate circle....aka Howard Hughes Pkwy. Its got purty decor like they got that tropical theme going. They make FLAMING DRINKS! Had a Flaming Dr Pepper here. The coconut shrimp is pretty good. Like the fans on the ceiling. It's purty too. Makes me feel like when i took the mirsus to hawaii...well not really it. was mah backyard and my cuzin Stu turned on the fan with some salt water to give us an ocean breeze.  Food ranges from Paella - to burgers - and yummy sammiches and jambalaya pasta, woodplank cooked fish and chicken.  I think one time I had the conch soup! I HAVE THE CONCH IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK!"}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of chain restaurants but my fiancée claims their buttermilk chicken is to die for so we stopped after bridesmaids dress shopping. Highly impressed, seated right away. Our server, I'm upset I forget her name (20s maybe early 30s, blonde) was amazing and friendly. Gave good recommendations and was courteous. Food was all tasty. Drinks were fantastic. Pricing was appropriate for the food we got. I would definitely come again if in that part of town, and like I said I hate chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there with my folks while they were visiting fun place great service and something fairly unique 2 break up the monotony of restaurants. I would definitely like to go back with a group of friends for an early dinner before a night out. They have great food and a lot of interesting and fun cocktails. Bonus just sit out on the porch next to the fire pit in the evening."}
{"text":"Love Bahama Breeze! Lunch menu is not too bad. It's a little pricey than normal, $8-$10 range but Bahama Breeze is a little more classy than your typical restaurant. And the island ambience is relaxing."}
{"text":"I love BB.  They have a great weekday Happy Hour.  My co-workers and I would frequently organize last minute Happy hours after our super long and stressful shifts (nurses).  Anyway, aside from happy hour we've been several time and it's usually pretty good. I'm an appetizer junky, so I pretty much enjoyed everything so far.  My absolute #1reason for going to BB is for their Ultimate Pina Colada!!  AMAZING!!  I will not go to BB unless I can have one...or two, okay sometimes there.  So good!!"}
{"text":"I went here for team lunch and ordered the Shrimp Linguini. The restaurant is very spacious and we didn't have to wait long to be seated. However, the food took awhile to cone out. We waited quite some time to get our food. The shrimp linguini that I ordered was a little on thw dry side. I wish they could have added a little more sauce. The atmosphere is very relaxing and makes people just want to hang around to listen to the Ragge music. Overall experience was good but I wish my dish would have been more flavorful."}
{"text":"As locals we love this place, its really good food, the fish is always fresh and delicious. Staff is courteous fun and knowledgeable. Close to the strip without the strips outrageous pricing!  We repeat at least once."}
{"text":"I'm in the area today shopping, and decided to stop here for lunch. It looks so cool inside that we opted to sit inside rather than outside, inspire of the fantastic weather today. That's how nice the décor is.  This time around we tried the coconut mojitos.  They were great!  For lunch, I got the half jerk chicken and tortilla soup. The soup was great, packed with flavor.  The jerk chicken not so much.  It was very bland, too bland to be Jamaican jerk chicken. The included on the side BBQ sauce, even just a little, completely dominated the chicken.  So if you want flavor, probably try a different dish. I'm trying a burger next time!"}
{"text":"I had the blackened chicken pasta. The chicken was perfectly cut, sliced very thin. It was very flavorful.. not too spicy & I am pretty sensitive to spicy food. The sauce wasn't too thick or filling. I will definitely be back to get this again! I got the full size portion & ate less than half of it for lunch. It was only $3 more so why not."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! They closed the one in Cincinnati so anytime I have a chance to go to Cleveland I jump on it."}
{"text":"Came here after the longest plane ride ever from Charlotte. Rode around and discovered Bahama Breeze. Me and my friend figured that since the parking lot was full at 2pm on a Friday afternoon...the food must be pretty good. We decided to order our food To-Go and the hostess was very helpful offering some recommendations. We order and we sit around chatting and people watching. After 15 minutes, our food is ready!

I ordered the Oak Grilled Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomato and goat cheese on Ciabatta bread....AMAZING! The chicken was tender and juicy and well seasoned. The cheese was slightly melted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and tasty! I ordered the tomato, basil and balsamic vinegarette salad on the side. I ate that on the way back to the resort so fast..I couldnt really tell you how it tasted...so I assume it was good. After the sandwich and and ice cold beer, I slept for hours :) 

Bahama Breeze?? You have a satisfied customer here! Now...build a restaurant in Virginia/DC area please!!"}
{"text":"We started with Cuban Bread and of course it was so delicious and my favorite app of all time. I am trying to transition into some non vegan foods and this was a fair start. It was a great decision. Next I had the curry rice but asked for veggies it has a chicken broth base but was told to me so I tried it and although I wish it had some coconut milk instead it was filling and huge and the chef and waiter were super accommodating for me! Last my whole family share everything thy had the ribs were a huge hit and the fish both salmon and tilapia were cooled perfect. Every plate was empty but mine and that is coming back to my suite with me :)"}
{"text":"Excellent,  beautiful Caribbean atmosphere,  extremely courteous staff !! Husband had fish tacos, I had Cobb salad, with Ahi tuna for appetizers, key lime pie for dessert, all outstanding, can t beat price either !!! Live band !!"}
{"text":"So I know it's a chain and all. But DAMN. They have delicious food! I live down the street and have been here a couple times. The bartenders (I usually sit at the bar) are always awesome and accommodating. I can't speak highly enough of the ahi tuna app and the mahi mahi and shrimp bowl. Freaking amazing. 

This is my neighborhood go-to spot! Without a doubt. Give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"The bartenders here were really nice and funny. They keeps our drinks full and the food was yummy. I got the jerk chicken pasta and subbed broccoli no problem. I am on a low sugar diet but was watching the bartender pump out the different tropical cocktails and my mouth was wateringggg!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it!
$3 Sangria at Happy Hour was awesome! 
Our group of 4 all loved their food.
I had the Buttermilk fried chicken layered with spinach, tomatoes and melted cheese.
It was delicious.

Everything I tasted was good.
I will definitely go back... wish they had this place in CA.

Also, the bathroom is really nice and they even have mouthwash which is a cool touch!
Guess I'm easily impressed!"}
{"text":"OK, so I know it's a \"chain\" but I love it and wish there were as many Bahama Breezes around the country as there are the other restaurants in this family and others.  I lived in Puerto Rico for several years, and spent a lot of time in the Virgin Islands and I love Caribbean food!  This place is very popular at Happy Hour and very family friendly too."}
{"text":"Came in here with the wifey on a Tuesday around 7pm randomly because one of our favorite Italian restaurants was closed on Tuesdays, and I personally was taken away by how great our experience - both service and food - was. 
This place was made both inside and out to be as if you were somewhere in the Caribbean, and it definitely reminded me of how it'd be like. The folks dining there even looked the part with most even wearing 'island tiki' type of tops and dresses. 
I was also surprised by how decent the menu pricing was with majority of the dinner menu around $18-23/25 and that's with steak/seafood items! 
Our server was also a nice and attentive man, with whom I forgot the name of (sorry!). 
We both really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, slightly dimmed with a mini waterfall running upon entering the restaurant that you hear along with Caribbean pop-type of music. 
And the entree portions were good enough to get us full but not TOO full.
We'd definitely be back to try some of their l drinks from their extensive drink menu next time! 

Thanks Bahama Breeze (You made the experience way better than my prom experience couple years ago lol)."}
{"text":"heard a lot about this place, went to try one day had worst experience. They are rude to their customers. I went with my family on thursday night  they refused to give us table and serve food at 10:30 pm.They were like we are not taking orders anymore. We called the manager also but he never showedup.  Before going to this place we had called them and they were like we take last order by 10:45 pm. I wouldn't suggest anyone to go to bahama breeze"}
{"text":"This Is My Second Time Calling In An Order And Driving In Over 20 Minutes To Get There To Still Wait For My Food. I Have Been Told 20 Minutes Just To Wait Over 40 Minutes On Both Occasions. The Food Is Pretty Good I Guess But The Service Gets A Thumbs Down From Me. If I Want To Enjoy The Bahama Breeze Experi I Guess I Have To Sit In"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Damn good food. Every dish was delicious.
The drinks were perfect.
Great service. Great atmosphere. 
Love this place."}
{"text":"We had a great night celebrating my parents 40th wedding anniversary, good food and friendly servers, definitely we're gonna come back here again"}
{"text":"It's a nice place for after work. I ordered the firecracker shrimp and it's greasy. The tortilla chip was so greasy. Looks like the deep fryer oil is old and need change. I ordered the ribs and is not that good. Boney baby back ribs. I was hoping the flavor is more Caribbean. The cabbage slaw is not flavorful. The Mojito is so so. Too much ice.  Expensive overall."}
{"text":"Food is good and consistent. Great happy hour prices. Servers had trouble with our 10 top and paid more attention to the smaller parties."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! If you're looking for authentic Caribbean good, you've come to the right place. The theme is so amazing, each booth has different beach type theme with bright colors everywhere you look. It is pricey but totally worth it!! Everyone was so nice and friendly I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't go out much here but I would say, of all the bars I've been to this has been one of the best I've been to. They have this signature drink that only them have, the Bahamarita. Reasonably priced and serving is big. I love it. I also tried there jerk chicken and it taste great. The nachos that they have is to die for. Big serving and simply delicious. 

Service given to us by Billy was good despite a lot of customers and he was covering a lot of tables. He was able to come visit us 2 times to check on us and he was read to offer us napkins before we asked.

Two thumbs up to Bahama breeze grille, definitely to be recommended! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"If You Like Piña Colada...

Stopped by \"BB\" during a quick lunch break and was was extremely impressed how quick service was considering the decent amount of guest dining. 

I ordered the Skillet Jerk Shrimp and it was delicious and flavorful. I enjoyed dipping the bread into the skillet to soak up the jerk flavor! Yummy!

The firecracker shrimp was pretty good as well. Golden brown fried to perfection.

I wish I could have added a little rum in my Piña Colada but for a virgin it was still pretty fruity and refreshing.

$25.00 later I'm satisfied!

Of course I'll return especially for Happy Hour"}
{"text":"It's a typical Darden Restaurant. The server was friendly but not very attentive. A manager approached every table but ours. Our appetizer was missing the sauce and no one stop by our table in between the delivery of the appetizer and the entree. I probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Bahama Breeze in a long time, but let me tell you - we had a stellar experience. 

I went with a group of coworkers and we all raved about our specialty drinks and dinner platters. There were endless options which made it difficult, but we were all happy with what we ordered. 

I ordered salmon and it was cooked to perfection. It was everything I was hoping it would be. My one coworker is a vegetarian and she forgot to ask for no bacon in her platter. When it came out and had bacon all in it, we mentioned it to our sever, but she didn't bat an eye even though it wasn't her mistake. She took the plate back to the kitchen right away and made sure it was cooked properly. 

The restaurant had a really fun, festive vibe inside and like I said, our server was amazing. She was very attentive and seemed to really enjoy her job. Her name was Kayla.

Bahama Breeze is definitely a new favorite for me and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit. We've driven past this place for years. So glad we decided to give it a try."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had here tonight. After being seated, our knowledgeable server Margo pointed out some great starters and  answered any questions about the menu. We started with salads that were crisp and fresh with a chunky and creamy blue cheese dressing. The pepitas on top gave some extra crunch.I had the jerk shrimp off the appetizer menu as my main course. It was a generous portion cooked in a savory broth with plenty of spice and diced tomatoes on top. Hubby enjoyed his ribs with a tasty and unique sauce. It was served with a slaw that had jicama, cilantro, and probably jalapeno, yum! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A tropical island in sin city, who knew?? 

From the coconut shrimp appetizer to my seared tuna entree with Jasmine rice to my boyfriends shrimp & lobster linguine, my ONLY regret is that I got full way to soon... OOhh but the leftovers were oohh so good too."}
{"text":"40 minute wait, non full restaurant on a Friday night. Waiter, Mike, came right away, but just said hi, he didn't ask for drinks before leaving. Came back in 10 minutes to take order.  Had a sweet tea. Mid drink he topped it off with water.  I questioned him about it and he said it was tea.  Took his time with things, cleaning tables before even being our drinks initially.  Food was ok. Won't come back."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and wanted to try something new! Yelp brought me to this gem. Service was fantastic. Food was perfect. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We arrived for a 4:30p reservation through Open Table. Our appetizers arrived at 5pm and our meal arrived at 5:20p. Our waitress, Annie, was very kind but said they are very short staffed in the kitchen. We gobbled most of the meal due to a flight at 7:30p and boxed the rest. Notified the manager of our displeasure. Will not return. Then! I was notified by open Table that they cancelled my reservation at 5:30pm! This is not right."}
{"text":"Good dinner of fresh seafood and salad. Awesome mojito too. Fast device. Very clean. Excellent prices. And many locals here after work mixed with hotel guests from nearby half dozen hotels. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"They offer a great after work happy hour from 4pm to 6 pm monday thru friday.  It's half off appetizers and drink specials on some select cocktails.  The food was good and the price was better.  The libations were exceptional.  The outside of the  building could use some tender loving care but the inside was nice.  It has a very manufactuered Carribean feel which isn't a bad thingv in this case.  The service was great and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"An oasis in the midst of Vegas craziness. Rafael (make sure you ask for him specifically) made the most delicious Micheladas I've ever had! I was in Vegas for 3 weeks on business and found myself escaping with co-workers to the Bahama Breeze at least 3x each week. We would walk in and Rafael would automatically begin making our drinks. Clearly, Rafael was a very wonderful bartender!

p.s. nothing goes better with Micheladas than their delicious milkshakes, coconut shrimp, calamari, and chicken kabobs."}
{"text":"The food was great!! And fresh. Services was good too everyone was friendly!! And the drinks were out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start, this place exceeded my expectations and I'm soooo glad we chose this restaurant over the sushi place next door to it. 

We started off with the coconut shrimp, which was delicious (the dipping sauce is really good). We also had the chicken wings and they were flavorful and finger licking good:-)

The mojitos are by far the best mojitos that I have EVER had and I've had lots and lots of mojitos!!! They had just enough sugar and mint and they had a pretty good kick to them, not to mention they were only $4.00 (during HH). Did I mention they had a pretty good kick:-) They were so good, we went back the next day, just for the mojitos (and not during HH - they were $7.00 each). 

For our main entrees, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken breast..OMG this dish is delish!!!!It's a layered dish of mashed potatoes, chicken breast, topped with spinach onions and cheese, and then layered again with another chicken breast and potatoes. On the side, the dish also included corn and black beans drenched in a wonderful sauce.  It sounds like alot and it is, don't worry about that, get a to go box if you have to. This dish is awesome and a must to try. I would order it again in a heartbeat. 

The atmosphere is nice (tropical theme) and the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. 

Great job Bahama Breeze!"}
{"text":"Every time that I've come get I have never been disappointed. For all those looking for a restaurant that has a great atmosphere, excellent service and bomb food, you have to try this place.

Happy hour at this place is worth the money!!! But when its not happy hour, its still worth coming to no matter what. Let me recommend a few things on the menu:

Habanero Wings- OH MAN, I don't eat a lot of spicy food but this one is so delicious! It has a mix of a sour cream and pico de gallo dipping sauce. All I can say is all the flavors is like a party in your mouth! I was cleaning up the bone and I never do that lol! The blend is perfect! This is a MUST ORDER when coming here! 

Jerk Chicken- Love the seasoning on this. I know they marinade it overnight and put it in the frier to give it a lil crunch. Lemme tell you this, they know how to season this to perfection. Love the sauce to add too, its a touch of sweetness. The combination together is like heaven

Beef Empanadas- Great starter, ALWAYS good to order before the food is coming, they use the same sauce for the habanero wings. Still, the pairing is always perfect when it comes to their sauces and food.

Calypso Shrimp Linguine- All the flavors pop in this dish. My 3 yr old son who is a picky eater will share this with me. The portion size is enough to feed me, my 3 yr old and my 8 yr old. This is a popular dish at this place, I've ordered this numerous times coming here. 

Jerk Chicken Pasta- YUM!!! it may not look as appetizing when you see the plate but DANG this one is a must order also. My husband would order this when we would come here until he discovered the....

Chicken Breast with Cilantro Crema- you have to eat each bite with the chicken, mash potatoes and the sauce. You will be craving this.

For Dessert: Order the Banana But Bread Supreme- you will not be disappointed!!!!! 

Can't go wrong with this place, you will never leave disappointed. The ONLY thing I don't like is that every time we arrive, we are always greeted by a homeless person asking for some money. Seriously EVERY SINGLE visit. Other than that, I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a large group of 60 people. We have the restaurant two weeks notices that we were coming. When we arrived tables were not set up, we had to set up ourselves. It took thirty minutes before our orders were taken, then it took another hour and a half to get out food. Keep in mind we were prepaid and had three items from the menu to choose from, burger, tacos, or pasta (not complicated dishes). The food tasted good, however some were cold by the time we got it. Also 6 people did not receive their food until 30 minutes after most of the party received their food. And in the end two people never received any food at all. 

Over all it was a terrible experience, if you are traveling in a large group DO NOT go to this restaurant. I don't know how it is when you are with two or three people verse 60, but clearly the restaurant can not handle large parties, and should have NEVER accepted us as such a large party."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed our first visit to Bahama Breeze. I have been meaning to try it for some time. We went in on a Saturday afternoon and they were not too busy. The food was pretty good, but the best part of the visit was the staff. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked up to my kids who were looking and the fountain and pulled two pennies out of his own pocket for them to throw into the fountain. When we were first sat it took a couple minutes for our waiter to come to the table and two of the other servers (who had just gotten off) noticed and without us having to ask went and found our server. Our server was also very friendly and did a great job. My family and I will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"It was a really nice place.  Everything was reasonably priced. The atmosphere felt warm and it can be a social event or it can be a privet date , anything works. The service was also great. No complaints. It's off the strip and not in the safest area but, it's not bad. Worth doing !"}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food, extremely slow service.  It took 20 minutes to get a glass of water and we were seated by a group with a screaming child, very annoying"}
{"text":"Caribbean inspired cuisine. Great service great food and Great Service .  I always stop by when in Vegas. A must !!!"}
{"text":"First of all our waiter Charles T. was one of the best. The atmosphere is very beachy. Loved the food! We got an appetizer of lobster and shrimp quesadillas that were awesome. The hibiscus and mango margaritas were decorated so beautifully and tasted great. Very good prices for being so close to strip."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice decor... I'm having trouble thinking of any bad things to say about this place.

Located off the strip near the Hard Rock Hotel, Bahama Breeze was a delightful place from beginning to end.

Our server was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Seafood Paella without the sausage, which our server said could be done.  One of the chefs came out a few moments later and said that the paella was made with the sausage in it and that they would be picking it out, which was fine with me so long as there wasn't any sausage actually on my plate.  I really appreciate this gesture because I know that not a lot of vegetarians would be cool with that.  When it came, I devoured it, which wasn't easy because it was a big plate of food.

My wife had the Fresh Pan-Seared Salmon Pasta, which was also amazing!

We had a couple of their specialty mixed drinks, which are not on the on-line menu so I don't recall the names.  But they were also very tasty.

Seems to me like most of the good food in Vegas is off the strip, and this would be a perfect example.  

We shall return!"}
{"text":"I love this place and there's a lot on their menu I really like.  I decided to try their new hummus appetizer.

It came out VERY thing and served with some sliced veggies and some crispy pita bread sorta thing.  The side items were very good, and I did actually like the hummus but it needed more carribean kick in the flavor and not be so thin and bland.

I tried their new Shrimp and 4 cheese grits.  The dish was made perfect and so were the grits but again everything was bland. It needs more kick in the flavor dept.  

The pineapple upside down chocolate cake was soooooooooo yummmy though.  Their seafood chowder is always good, and I've had their black beans and fish tacos many times and it is definitely yummmy.  

I will definitely keep coming back to this place again.  I just prefer more spice/flavor in my dishes. (spice doesn't mean spicy, just fyi)"}
{"text":"Happy hour is Monday through Friday 4 pm to 6 pm. Appetizers are half off, some well drinks and some beer too. Sam( a lady)was a great mentor to her trainee who was learning on the Job. We had the Jamaican wings, well done. The Chipotle bowl was so tasty, the fresh fish, my mom had a Tilapia get it if you can, it's light and tastes great! The service and ambience was mellow and great, the overhead reggae music is so catchy.  For dessert we have the banana Rum cake, just deliciousness! Great spot for a birthday celebration! Go here... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is enjoyable and portions are big. Tried there Jamaican chicken wings and jerk shrimp. Both were average."}
{"text":"Really nice place. My friend always visit this place and requested me to come.
Nice coctails. Blue one is semi sweet refreshing.
Salad with shrimps was good too.
And we ordered salmon.
We left this place satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to find a restaurant that had good ratings, was something that \"locals\" would eat at, and was OFF The Strip.  This restaurant fit the bill perfectly.  Service was speedy, both in seating and in getting our food.  Our server was Sam and she was quite pleasant and knowledgeable, even joking around with me after I made some of my usual sarcastic comments.  I had asked her what was good here and what she'd recommend and, when she told me, I said that I'd trust her and that it would be her fault if my dinner wasn't great...all the time with a smirk on my face.  It turns out that she was right.  One of her recommendations was the seafood paella.  It was the first time I'd had paella and it was awesome!  She asked me later on why I hadn't left her any so that she could have some dinner that night and I said that it was just too good to leave behind.  We both chuckled and she said she was glad to hear it.  The pina colada I had was really good, but stir it up first.  Most of the rum goes in first and is then swirled in with the rest of the drink which resembled a very thick milkshake's consistency.  Yum!  I can easily see myself returning to this restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, AWFUL experience at Bahama Breeze the other day.

We were seated right away for an early lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.

Our server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fiancé.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, \"I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?\"  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.

I have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.

The manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.  

We paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.

Steer clear of this place - the service is sub-par.  There are much better places to dine in this city."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant I ate at this week. Was better than Gordon Ramsey steak earlier in the week. Plus it only cost me 50 bucks instead of 300. The specialty drinks were delicious. The shrimp tacos were excellent."}
{"text":"Our server, Fred, was the highlight of this experience. I am a vegetarian, and my husband and son are pescatarians. We don't expect people to completely understand these dietary restrictions, but Fred did. He let us know exactly what to order and not to order. (Fyi... the black bean soup has pork in it). 

I had the linguine. It was very good. The sauce had a slight spicy kick, but just enough. My son had the tilapia, which I was grateful to see on the kids menu. 

Summer is reggae time. I wish we knew this Saturday night. They have a 5 piece Jamaican band Saturdays, but we missed it. There was a live musician though, who was fun and friendly. Loved the music and the atmosphere at this place. 

The Bahamarita was fun and delicious. Even better, they have a virgin version, which made my daughter's night. 

When my daughter melted down and wanted to leave immediately (it was late), Fred was super fast getting us out the door. This goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because it was close to the hotel and it had good ratings.  I ordered a house margarita, a cup of seafood chowder and the firecracker shrimp appetizer.   The margarita was good.  About what one expects for the house version.  The chowder was excellent.  The fish and scallop pieces were perfectly cooked and the flavor was spot on.  The shrimp is very good.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's Bday get together and was also my first time here.  Cool, chill, island theme restaurant with very friendly servers.  It's a casual, family style restaurant and not really somewhere you would like to take someone out on a date if you are looking for something quiet to converse because it's pretty loud inside. It's pretty huge inside also, but I don't know how busy this place usually gets.  I doubt you need to call for reservations unless you're planning to come with a big group.

I ordered the coconut shrimp and calamari.  Pretty good but I can't tell you about the other dishes since this is the only one I ordered.  But I'm sure if you come in a big group, you'll end up trying other stuff also."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for the first time.  We sat on the deck and took in the fresh air.  I do enjoy sitting outside and eating, so having this as a viable option is nice. 
The service was OK.  We waited too long for re-fills, the waiter didn't make any real attempt to  make our experience better, but we got our food, we were served.  
The food also wasn't anything too special.  The wife got the creamy jerk chicken pasta.  The sauce was good, it had plenty of chicken and asparagus, but lacked mushrooms.  She would probably give it 4 stars, but what I tried I'd say 3.  
I got the goat cheese and avocado burger.  The beef tasted good, but was overcooked slightly.  There were plenty of toppings and it was messy as it should be.  But again it was just a bit above average.
That being said, slightly above average food, nice atmosphere, and slightly below average service gives Bahama Breeze a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is located conveniently on Flamingo and Paradise road. It's a great place to meet for cocktails, dinner etc. We had dinner Saturday night for a friend's birthday. I ordered the Caribbean chowder and the pineapple coconut martini. I also sampled a friend's cheeseballs which were excellent. Our server was very accommodating to our group, we had a party of 7 but each person arrived at different times between 730pm and 10pm. Our server did an excellent job of keeping track of our orders and the separate billings. We really appreciated that. The price of the food and drink is reasonable, I noticed that the menu has changed since the 5 years that I was last there. They have a lot more options and they are keeping up with changing tastes. We will return especially for happy hour"}
{"text":"I was there a few months ago but thought people should know if my experience...A few people in my life know I am allergic to seafood and I have to be careful where I eat and drink. However, I sometimes take chances when there is something I have a craving for. One recent night, I went to Bahama Breeze (http://www.bahamabreeze.com) because I wanted their West Indies Patties. The friend I was dining with can't eat spicy food so she asked our waiter Jay for a sample of their jerk sauce  but Jay didn't know  how spicy the sauce was so he went and got a sample for her and the chef Dan Strohecker came with him. Since the chef was at the table I figured I would ask if they use the same oil to cook everything. Dan said he couldn't guarantee that they didn't but especially when a rush comes on. He graciously offered to cook the patties in new oil for me in a skillet. I was floored because that has NEVER happened in any restaurant I have ever eaten at. He said they will do anything within reason to ensure their guest enjoy themselves and any allergy issues are addressed.  I thanked him and he went and got started on my patties. Jay brought them to the table and a short time later Dan came back and asked me how they were and he looked down and laughed cuz the plate was empty. He said there's my answer! He said he had never cooked them that way before and didn't know if they would turn out light and crunchy like they do when fried in the deep fryer. I told him not only were they light but the crunch was unbelieveable. Not too hard and not to soft. Just perfect! I thanked him again and told him I would tell all my friends and blog about it. Bahama Breeze is one of the more successful restaurants in Las Vegas and now I know why! The food is exceptional but the service and attention to customers is phenomenal! Beyond anything I have ever experienced before. They are better than 5 star in my book. When you are there, tell Dan what a wonderful chef he is and request Jay as your waiter. You won't be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Ghetto, bad service, gross food. And I used to love coming here, my last visit was very disappointing, I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was really good. Waitress was attentive and honest when asked her opinion on lunch choices. I had the jerk chicken wings as an appetizer. Although I remember the being much bigger in the past, the flavor was great and they were cooked really well. 
Shrimp and Grits were fantastic! Posted a photo. Hadn't been in awhile but will for sure be going back sooner than later."}
{"text":"So we usually enjoy the drinks here, but rarely eat there.   The food was decent, BUT the Tuna Poke (or something similar) that I ordered had gone bad.  The waitress was really cool about it and I just got a different appetizer, but I could have gotten really sick.   Everything else has always been good."}
{"text":"Third time that I have been there this year and every time I order a drink, they water it down. I asked for their strongest drink and I was disappointed again. I asked the server if he can tell me why, and he had no answer for me.  I switched to their coronarita, same thing.  Food was pretty good, can't complain there.  Also, that party room on the west side is always hot.  So here it is, if you want to pay $12 a drink to be in nicely decorated room that reminds you of the islands, then go for it. If not, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am notoriously picky and to go to dinner and have multiple courses come out with no issues is amazing. Service was friendly and quick to refill a drink. Conch fritters were crispy a flavorful. Caesar salad with their house vinaigrette- citrus flavor was fresh and light. And the paella. THE PAELLA!!! To die for! Amazing flavor with enough spices to keep things lively but not too much so. The pineapple crene brûlée was unique - almost more of a pineapple pudding with the sugar glazed topping. Definitely worth trying. All in all, 2 thumbs WAY up."}
{"text":"I entered this restaurant's name. I chose the number of stars it shall receive from me. I clicked my cursor in the review box. I shrugged and shook my head. See, I've been to this Bahama Breeze a couple times before, because I discovered it's a place I can get a bowl of some really yummy chicken tortilla soup, complete with freshly sliced cubes of avocado. And, it's certainly nice to dine in a restaurant void of video poker machines and giant flat screens displaying every single game you can bet on. The decor's nice -- they certainly did an excellent job of creating the outside indoors. The service, plain and simple, is just nothing to write home about. Or write about at all. Last night, I met up with a group of friends there for dinner, and they seated us on the patio. Why the patio was even open, I have no idea. Even with the heater towers, we were freezing. The hostess relocated us, and it took quite a while for our orders to be taken, and took days for our food to arrive, without so much as an explanation or apology. In fact, our server completely disappeared after our orders were taken. A food runner delivered our plates. I did notice, however, that the complaining stopped once we did receive our meals. The food certainly is pretty darn tasty, and the presentation impressive. I'm just going to convince myself that it's been the luck of the draw as far as service has gone on my previous experiences, and give it one more try.

Sure do love that soup. ,': )"}
{"text":"For a chain, this place ain't half bad. It's a great hangout specially if you get a table outside in summers.

Cocktails are the real deal here. My favorite would be Zombie and Mango Mojito. There are few other colorful options so every visit can be a new experience. No point if you play safe here.

Not a big fan of main course but appetizers are great. Having been to Jamaica, I can say that the jerk chicken here comes close to the actual authentic version. Coconut shrimps are good too. As for the main course, I always go with West Indies Chicken rice bowl. It has a mixed Caribbean and Indian flavor which appeals to me.

Make sure you get a seat outside, possibly facing the Robinson mall. That alone will add to the pleasure in a warm evening."}
{"text":"As a Vegas native this place is By far my absolute favorite for happy hour!! My favorites are..Best mojitos, best shrimp skillet with fresh Cuban bread, & best Jamaican wings! Sun-Thurs. 9pm- closing. A must try place with great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The service was bad and the food was worse. I ordered the seafood paella and beef empanadas and they were poorly presented and tasted like something you would get from the frozen food section at Walmart. I also had a $10 off coupon that I couldn't use because apparently, my strawberry lemonade (with no alcohol) is considered a 'happy hour' item. Well, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"At a loss for a new place to explore and write about, Kay and I journeyed to the chain restaurant stronghold of Robinson the other night for the dining choices in this suburban kingdom are multitudinous. 

If I was to eat at a chain on this evening (and I do so often and somewhat willingly), it was going to be a place that offers the kind of food we don't get much of in Western PA. 

The decor is as kitschy as a B-52's gig. Giant straw canopies hang from the ceiling. The pillars appear to be made from trees. None of the help looks or sounds as if they hail from the Carribean, but it is likely that some of them spent or will spend a Spring Break there. Billy Ocean didn't drop in. Ben Zephaniah probably wouldn't like the place. Jimmy Buffet might own stock in the franchise.

Authentic or not though (and I certainly have my doubts), Bahama Breeze lived up to its namesake in that the food was just easy to like.

Our opener was a serving of the Crab Claws St. Thomas.  Blue crab is used, the generous amount of tiny claws swimming in a snappy \"Island Citrus Butter\". A loaf of pillowy \"Cuban Bread\" comes to the table in a bag (to keep it fresh) for the purposes of soaking up that wonderful butter. The crab claws were fun to eat and required no hardware or labor. You just put them in your mouth and pull that dainty meat off with your teeth. If there were 100 of them, we would have finished them all with extreme prejudice. 

I so wanted to try Jerk Chicken, but at Bahama Breeze it's served with pasta, which seems so...touristy? Is that the right word?

Note #1-One really cool thing Bahama Breeze does is offer a \"lighter portion\" of many of their dishes, a godsend for those on a diet or on a budget as you get less food and pay a little less. That little perk almost made me order the Jerk Chicken Pasta as well as a few of their other entrees.

Being true to my blue-collar, sandwich-loving, Friday-state-of-mind self, I instead ordered a Cuban since I really wanted to try a good one, not a Panera-grade one (see my reviews archive). 

Lo and behold, it's a dandy and flattened oven-baked Italian hoagie with Swiss cheese in lieu of Provolone, \"Cuban\" bread in lieu of Italian, pork, and more familiar components in tomato, lettuce, and mayonnaise. No pickle or mustard was to be found, however. Not that I minded as this was one hearty yet tidy and planar hero, artfully sliced in half on a bias. 

Note #2-Another cool thing about Bahama Breeze is their choice of sides. In the case of sandwiches, the choices include mere french fries, a tomato salad, yellow rice with black beans, and my pick; the brisk, fresh, palate-restoring fruit salad. Grapes danced with pineapple chunks in a ramekin as a small scoop of orange sherbet oversaw the affair. 

Kay's Chicken with Cilantro Crema was good enough, but the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were a symphony of spud, roasted corn, and a trio of cheeses. 

For dessert, we traded off on the Chocolate Island and the Bananas Supreme. Once again, cultural cred is in question, but the flavors were undeniable. I preferred the mousse/brownie silo that is the Island and the sea of chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise that surrounded it. The Bananas Supreme is Bananas Foster collaborating with that school fundraiser classic, Banana Nutbread. It's warm, there's butterscoth, brandy, and vanilla ice cream involved; it's an effortless winner. 

Being that this Bahama Breeze is the only one of its kind in this side of the state, it's easy to forget that you're dealing with a chain here. The quality food only helps to further that end. 

And now...Bad Brains...

{"text":"It was not bad but not great...shame ...I was hoping for better food ...stay away from the house salad...the dressing used was barely on it...bland taste too"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this spot I was impressed with the decor. I heard sounds of a waterfall and the high ceilings were matched with bridges painted with appealing finishes. I got the happy hour experience which was enjoyful. Not only was my bill very inexpensive, my server was pleasant as well. There's free wifi, and lots to choose from on their menu. I ordered a couple appetizers and enjoyed the water. Some pros and cons are listed below.

Pros: wifi, appealing decor, kind service, not too loud, quick seating time, lots of table space, clean

Cons: Waited for straws, food quality was decent, food presentation decent, small quantities

Overall: I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is m-f, 4-6.
$3 cocktails.
$4 specialty drinks.
$5 appetizers."}
{"text":"What a treat. During my one day stay in Vegas for business and personal, my sister and her hubby took me here after they picked me up at the airport. With the name, I was quick to be like EGH...boy was I wrong. This just proves the saying, \"Don't knock it, till you try it\". For appetizers, we ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Tostones with Chicken. OMG, both were absolutely perfect, especially the Coconut Shrimp. Its considered one of their house specialties. As for my main order, I had the Chicken Santiago. YUMMY !!!!!!!!! The red roasted pepper sauce sealed the deal. I know this place is a bit off the strip but Yelpers if ever your in Vegas and need a break from the endless buffets, stop by this place, if you lost or possibly won in Vegas, at least you could go home full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!
We went for lunch one day of our stay at Vegas

Now, every time we're in Vegas..
this will be the spot to go to for lunch :]
All thanks to Jenny J. and Mike L. :D"}
{"text":"I was here for my friend who through a party over here. Utter Disappointed with food. The drinks were fine but the food is no Caribbean or freshly made. Just tasted like frozen food. Never going to any of this chain restaurants again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Vegas always have top notch service every waitress is amazing"}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times already on special occasions and we love the food, the staff and the ambiance. Great place!"}
{"text":"Not as terrible as you would expect~! The drinks were reasonably priced and tasty ($6ish for a decent fruity mojito). Coconut shrimp were tasty, and the skewers were great as well.. came with a good sized portion of meats and veggies. Atmosphere is nice and tropical (as one would expect)."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, there's a 45 minute wait despite having multiple sections open. 
However, the one time I was actually able to get a seat, we waited for someone to notice us at the hostess stand for 10 minutes. When finally seated, it was like no one knew who was working our table, so we didn't get our drink orders taken for nearly 30 minutes. The service continued to disappoint when no one came back after we got our food to check if we wanted refills. Although the food was good, the service is some of the worst I've ever seen. I honestly don't know how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"I Enjoy their drinks and the indoor/outdoor patio area. Fun relaxing place. Go a couple times a year whenever in town."}
{"text":"I went for mother's day dinner..it was crowded which was expected so that wasn't an issue. But I believed the cooks we're overwhelmed withe the crowd and serving not so tasty food. I ordered the buttermilk chicken and mash dinner disappointed it was salty and cold. Thought I would have better luck with the banana supreme...the presentation was so unappealing and thrown together...overrun was soup like it was sitting for awhile... I'm never going back"}
{"text":"Do not come here with a group. Their waiter takes a looong time to place and bring drink orders. The waiter then takes your order and come back after 10-15 minutes to say that they don't have the item you ordered anymore. They ran out literally a minute ago. Then you order something different and are told that they also are out of THAT item.  Each item was labeled as a \"signature dish\". How do you run out of something labeled as such and not inform guests before they order. 

Upsetting place. Tons and tons of other restaurant options around it to consider."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. The Food was bland and overpriced considering it was all canned/processed/frozen. I had a raw ahi tuna appetizer and the tuna was clearly frozen and probably past its 'use by' date. I've had canned tuna that tasted fresher. Our entrees were not that much better. 

First and last time. There are so many good dining options in Cleveland. Why we decided to try the TGI Fridays of Caribbean restaurants is beyond me."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people and the service was superb. 

I got the Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken and the meal comes with a side of vegetables and sweet potato and topped off with plantain chips.  The food was decent...I can't complain.  Maybe it was something that I am not accustomed to eating, but still well prepared.  

I do love the service here.  Red was awesome and was very curteous to our party."}
{"text":"This place is a nice relaxed feel with live music. The shrimp and lobster linguine pasta is good and they give you a lot! You can share 1 plate with 2 people and the drinks are good and fruity!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the South, so I've had some great ribs. When I saw the rum and coke sauce ribs on the menu here I thought it sounded interesting and I gave them a try. They were phenomenal! Seriously like the best ribs I've ever tasted.

The key lime pie was also tasty and my husband and I enjoyed great cocktails, as always. All in all, a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I come here once every year...once out of curiosity and the rest I was forced to do so because I was threatened with a free meal. This place reminds me more of San Diego and not the Bahamas. Service here isn't consistent. Good servers, bad servers and the in-betweens. The food is quite average. I've had great meals when I went to Bahamas so I'd always hope they'd remind me of my trip. They have conch fritters but it's disappointing. I must say their drinks are pretty solid though. Here's some that I've tried: 

Yaka Hula Hickey Dula:
Riesling, pineapple juice and dark rum. I like pineapple/pineapple juice, I like Riesling, rum is ok. Nice fruity but strong drink. 5/5

Ultimate Pina Colada:
Captain Morgan rum, strawberry and pineapple ice and dark rum. It's like drinking a smoothie - not much alcohol here. 4/5

Crispy Onion Rings:
Large onions rings breaded with Panko and coconut flakes. The sauce is a sweet mustard...I'm not a fan. 2/5

Coconut Shrimp:
Shrimps breaded with coconut flakes, citrus-mustard sauce on the side. This is supposed to be a best-seller. I'm still not a fan. 2/5

Beef Empanadas:
Fried dough filled with beef and potatoes.  Comes with mango salsa and a dipping sauce. Forgettable. 2/5

Tostones with Chicken:
Fried plantains with sweet peppers, mushrooms, chicken, cheese and tomato salsa. Biggest mistake and probably the worst item on the menu. I love tostones and this was a major let down. There's so much going on with this dish. 1/5

Shrimp Creole Bowl, Chicken Curry:
Nothing to write home about. 2/5

Chicken Tortilla Soup:
Chicken breast, tortilla strips, carrots, roasted corn, avocado and lime. This is my go-to menu item when I don't feel like wasting my calories. 4/5

Big Island:
Chocolate mousse, brownie, milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. Chocolate mousse and vanilla anglaise are yummy...the brownie, not so much. 4/5

Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake:
Warm chocolate cake with a pineapple ring on top and a molten chocolate center, raspberry sauce and fruits on the side. I love pineapple, I love chocolate but I do not love this dessert. If there's rum in this cake, it would've been delicious. 3/5

I've come here and have tried a lot of things on their menu but I just couldn't find anything that's good. I only come here for the liquid diet: soup and alcohol...and maybe the Big Island too. I'm just not in love with this place at all."}
{"text":"Ate here with a large group from work. Our service was very good considering the size of our group (about 20 people). The coconut shrimp tacos were so good! The other grilled fish tacos weren't as good. It was pretty busy even for a Weds night. My co-workers all raved about their food as well."}
{"text":"This is my second trip here and my first in quite some time. The food was really good and the drinks more so. I had two Bahama Mamas and we ordered the Fire-Roasted Jerk Shrimp and Crab Claws St. Thomas for appetizers. For our meal my wife and I split a hamburger. Our waitress was fun and paid attention to detail. Too bad the kitchen staff didn't. A friend of ours ordered the Chicken Sliders. When they came they were do it yourself. The buns, chicken and toppings all came seperated. As for our hamburger that we ordered everything on the side and sure enough it came all assembled. Hey, kitchen, here's a clue. Listen to your waitress. They usually know what they're doing and when you don't listen you wind up hurting them and your business."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced food.  Lots of seating and a good size parking lot.  There were 18 of us.  They waited until we were all there; then we got seated in the outdoor patio. 

A husband/wife team took care of us.  And they took the initiative to ask how many separate checks did we need.  How often does that happen?

I ordered a new item - mahi mahi and shrimp with lemongrass rice bowl.  Great ratio of seafood and veggies.  I would order it again."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Live music, great food, amazing cocktails!! One of my favorite restaurants! Jerk chicken pasta is a must have!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place! The restaurant itself is pretty huge and they do a terrific job maximizing the space and setting a great environment. There's a very diverse drink menu for anyone's needs. The Bahamarita is the way to go in my opinion. After two or three, you can't really feel your face. They have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone. My girlfriend never orders anything but the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which comes in a huge portion that can be shared or taken home for a second meal. I myself love the Steak Oscar, which is an 8 oz sirloin topped with buttery crab meat. How can you beat that?! They also have a great happy hour for those who are lucky enough to work close to the Strip but luckily, there is a reverse happy hour that starts at 9 as well."}
{"text":"I only had time for a beer and appetizer. Unfortunately for me i had tickets to criss angel(wish i had skipped the show and enjoyed a full dinner and a few more beers) i had a pint of aruba red and the buttermilk chicken sliders. Both went very well with eachother and look forward to having again some day. I really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is so good. The atmosphere is great. They sometimes have live music depending on what time and day you go. I usually get their jerk chicken pasta which has asparagus and mushroom in it. I usually replace the mushrooms with bacon and it's amazing. I also highly recommend any of their lemonades they're so fresh and good. Other people in my group have tried the jerk chicken sandwich and said it was great as well and also the chicken with the cilantro crema it comes with mashed potatoes and corn and that's very good too. I haven't had anything bad from here yet! However the service isn't the best. No matter when we go it's always very slow. We find ourselves constantly asking and waiting for refills. The staff is very nice and I understand it gets busy but even when we go on a slow day the service is still slow. But overall I highly recommend this place! Definitely try the pasta and lemonade and try to sit in their little outdoor area it's really nice!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bahama Breeze and I didn't know what to expect. We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Believe it or not, they had a 1 hour wait. But that's okay, we managed to find an empty chair in the huge foyer. Turns out that they have the best Piña Coladas ever. I had a Ultimate Piña Colada - swirled with strawberry ice and topped with Myers's Dark Rum and BJ had a couple Red Stripe beers. Yum. The wait time flew by, thanks in part to the island atmosphere and the live island music. 

The host staff was great. When we were finally seated, we got a huge booth. Our server was pretty sad. I'm not sure what industry she should work in, but definitely not in the service industry. But we managed to get thru okay. 

We shared a new appetizer on the menu. We got a Crab, Shrimp, Mango and Avocado Stack. It was a little stack of jumbo lump crabmeat, chilled shrimp, fresh avocados and apple-mango salsa layered and stacked; with a spicy honey-red pepper drizzle served on some frisée lettuce. The drizzle was very hot and the seafood was incredibly fresh. We loved it! 

For dinner, Jim had Calypso Shrimp Linguine. It was spicy shrimp sautéed with garlic, scallions, creole spices and a touch of cream. The portion was huge and very delicious. I had the Jamaican Grilled Chicken Breast with mango glaze, served with fresh mango pineapple salsa, cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes and green beans. Very good. 

For dessert, we shared a Chocolate Island. It was a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie in a milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise with vanilla ice cream. Very yummy. 

We loved the restaurant and can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Last night 2 friends and I were looking for somewhere to get food and drinks after the fireworks on 4th of July. We tried to go to Herbs & Rye but it was closed! We eventually ended up at Bahama Breeze, and it was honestly a great experience. I have been here a handful of times before and have always enjoyed it. I really love their late night happy hour, although we could not take advantage of that last night because it was a Saturday, oh well. Without a doubt my absolute favorite thing about this place is that every single item from drinks to food to dessert has the CALORIE COUNT on the menu! This is super helpful for me since I log all of my calories daily. I chose the Painkiller cocktail which was delicious, for dinner I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich on a brioche bun for only 400 calories, and I added avocado which was a generous portion and perfectly ripe. My choice of side was the Vine Ripened Tomato Salad which came in a balsamic dressing and was very good as well. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was great. My friends had the Shrimp and Grits which looked incredible, and a steak with mashed potatoes which was perfectly cooked, and a nice looking Caeser Salad and Clam Chowder. I would have liked to order a dessert but there was nothing even remotely low in calories lol. Service was great and we were all pleased with our meals, and I like that they are open until midnight every night."}
{"text":"Their smothered pork goodness is to die for. I loved the crispiness of the pork coupled with the awesome fried yuka balls with cheese inside smothered by guava sauce.
My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich which is just ok. Their Cubano Mojito is also good, refreshing and has a good alcohol in it. 

The only reason I gave this a 4 stars is because the server is not too friendly. I feel that hospitality has to be good for this place to get a 5 star. 

I'll recommend this place and will surely comeback."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her 19th anniversary of her 21st birthday. Everything was perfect. Food was phenomenal, service was friendly and attentive. We had so much fun! We even took a picture with our waitress! She was awesome!"}
{"text":"A friend treated me to lunch recently, and a treat it was.  The food was fresh, hot, service was good, and I will return, and don't mind paying.  The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food, and location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner with my girlfriend. Plenty of parking, it wasn't busy, we were seated right away  I couldn't help but notice how sticky the floors were as we walked through the restaurant. So sticky I could hear our shoes peeling off the floor. 
We ordered the lemon breeze drinks and they were good.  Beef empanadas for an appetizer and they were good
I ordered the carnita rice bowl and it was heAvy but really good. My girlfriend ordered the fish tacos and they were barely warm. The manager was nice and took them off the bill 
It's very unlikely we will go here again."}
{"text":"When we want to sit outside in the summer months for a quick bite to eat and have a drink, we like this place.  The outside seating on the wraparound porch is very nice and the plantings have matured so your view of the Parking lot is obscured.  

Bahama Breeze is a chain so the food is predictable but tasty   

Glad this place is at Robinson Town Center.  Nice stop while we're out picking something up."}
{"text":"Nothing special today but wanted to try something different, it had been a while since we had tried this place. 

Walking in, not a lot people here, about half full, we were seated and it was a while before our server showed up. She got our drink order and away she went. 

We finally got our drinks and we placed our app order, we got the spinach dip and chips, spinach  with artichokes in a creamy cheese dip was good! We also got a nacho made with plantans, this was good and a bowl of seafood chowder, also good. 

About here, I decided I wanted one of their specialty drinks so I picked out the blue hawaiian or something like that but after 25 minutes we had to ask for it again and when it came, tall skinny glass, I think maybe four sips and it was gone! 

For main fair, I got the mahi mahi. It was good but our food and drinks took so long coming we both felt like leaving! My husband got the shrimp and cheesy grits, it was good. 

Finally when she came to ask about dessert we just handed her the bank card and said bill please!"}
{"text":"Bahama Breeze is one of the better chain restaurants to go to. I went there to celebrate my mother's birthday and we shared the beef empanadas and spinach dip as our appetizers. It was happy hour so they were both half price. The empanadas are my favorite thing on the menu and the spinach dip is awesome. It also comes with plantain chips as well as the normal tortilla chips. Jerk chicken pasta is what I ordered for dinner. They offer a lighter portion as well- but then you don't get to take home leftovers! You can't go wrong with their jerk chicken pasta. It comes with mushrooms and asparagus, I added broccoli for no extra charge to mine. I've always had excellent service here, and they even put candles in our rum cake for my moms birthday dessert! With the fun Caribbean music- they really provide an escape. And it's not your typical burger joint."}
{"text":"oh so good. I came to Vegas and ate at Terribles, Ballys Buffet, and the 24 hour diner at Hooters so I was dying for some decent food. The spices in the dishes here are unique and really refreshing from the typical fare you find in the big casino restaurants. The service is uber slow, but it's almost fun just watching other tables' dishes come out since they all look so appetizing and smell like heaven- even though 90% of them had meat in them and I'm a bloody vegetarian. I think that says a lot. Or speaks volumes about how terrible Hooters food is?"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had the chicken tortilla soup and the jerk chicken sandwich. My husband had shrimp tacos and asparagus. Everything was perfectly seasoned, and the lunch portions were just right."}
{"text":"We probably make it here two to three times a year. The restaurant is large enough to accommodate our larger party if our family decides to go there last minute without reservation. Overall, the food is OK, nothing really has ever been mind blowing and nothing has ever been a fail. We like to come here because the restaurant is spacious with a laid back island feel and atmosphere. Service has never been an issue either and we have sat in all areas including the main dining area, the bar area, and in the indoor patio area.

The firecracker shrimp street tacos, the Jamaican chicken wings, and the ahi tuna stack are pretty decent starters. The whole wing is served as the appetizer so be ready to share. For entrees, the paella and the steak oscar have been satisfactory. But the last few visits I have ordered something from the fresh fish menu.

Our last visit was on a Saturday night and we sat in the indoor patio area. They had a gentleman playing live music for our entire stay. The music did not drown out our conversation, but you should request another seat if you would like a more peaceful environment. 

For drinks, we had the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula and the Painkiller. Both cocktails were strong but nice mixes with kick from the rum. They were too strong for my wife, so that meant two dinner cocktails for me. I had the sauteed tilapia with chimichurri sauce as my entree. My wife had a turkey burger. My fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky with the chimichurri being a nice accompaniment. For dessert, the chocolate pineapple upside down cake was enjoyed by both of us.

As long as Bahama Breeze continues to be consistent, we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"It is absolutely and unnecessarily unsanitary to eat in a racist shithole. Having dealt with worse as a customer and having been a chef in food service, this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable for a business of this sort. This business needs staff that have been trained in hospitality or they need to shut their doors forever."}
{"text":"Love this place drinks are on point you can get a hole pineapple drinks makes you feel like your in paradise, food is amazing they have happy hour and we love there coconut shrimp delicious"}
{"text":"This place is located on the corner of Flamingo and Paradise in a little plaza. I came here for my cousins b'day. We wanted to stay away from the strip for a change. To start off the night we ordered some frozen bahamaritas and appetizers. Warm spinach, artichokes and cheese, with a hint of nutmeg. It hit the spot. As for dinner, I ordered the Seafood Paella with seafood, chicken, sausage and peas with yellow rice. OMG...you can't go wrong with this dish. For dessert we shared he warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. It reminded me when I was back in the Caribbean.  yum-yum in my tum.  Our waiter was awesome.  He always topped off our drinks and was very attentive."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas with my husband and this restaurant located across the street where we stayed. I've never tried the Carribean food, but I really loved chicken past which I ordered. Also, hibiscus margarita was amazing! The server was very nice and polite. I'd love to go back again next time."}
{"text":"I mainly went here because when they were in Phoenix I really enjoyed the experience and seeing they were in Pitt I went for it.  Unfortunately that experience was not to be the same 10 years later.  The decor is the same but the menu is a bit different.  Not sure if they are really keeping up with the times but I ordered what I did the last time I was at a BH.  The service should set the tone but seeing that it was the pre-dinner hour I was totally ignored once my order was put in.  The waitress was preoccupied with the table with employees on break than she was serving the bar.  I was not offered a water while I waited and was only told have a nice day after she gave me the order.  She did not check it for accuracy nor ask me if I needed anything else which I did in the measly amount of salad dressing that came with the order.  Suffice it say the salad was a tad brown on the edges so I ended up throwing most it out less the tomatoes and sliced cucumber.  Anyway, the wings were my favorite back in the day but they definitely lacked any flavor.  To sum it up I would say this was a big thumbs down, sad because I really wanted to come back again before I left."}
{"text":"This place was eh.  The menu is not the best and the food is ok.  We shared the Spinach Dip which was good.  This item was the only thing we shared and a few hours later we all had some stomach issues.

I got the lunch combo of a salad and a qusadilla with lobster and shrimp.  It was tasty but nothing to write home about.  The salad dwarfed the quasdilla. It was a lunch portion though.

My colleagues enjoyed their meal but they have had better.

The waiter was ok, he had a little attitude.  

I would not recommend Bahama Breeze as there are many better chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Well I missed the $10 burger and a beer promo they have going on, but I didn't need that for lunch anyhow.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3\" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.
whoohoo

When we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4."}
{"text":"I came here for prom and the food was delicious. It was karaoke night and my friends and I really enjoyed it. The food was great and the customer service was awesome. We had 17 people and they managed to set us up with a reservation last minute. We all enjoyed ourselves. The atmosphere is really fun and everyone was outgoing and welcoming. I definitely would come back here."}
{"text":"After leaving Fremont we decided to grab a drink. My friend had previously tried out Bahama Breeze so we headed in that direction. We ordered: Bahamarita, Virgin Margarita,  and Ultimate Pina Colada.


We also ordered: Firecracker shrimp, Jerk chicken wings, Lobster shrimp quesadilla , and Beef empanadas. 

The Food was ehhh. We did not care for the empanadas. The lobster and shrimp quesadilla was the real winner. The firecracker shrimp and jerk chicken wings were just ok. 
The Drinks were better than the food. The drinks had a light alcohol taste. Service was fast and we never had to look for the server. He was always prompt with refills and checking on us. 

Not impressed overall with the food. Great thing is everything we ordered was on the happy hour menu so half off."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a chain place...I've spent quite a bit of time in Jamaica over the years, and the food is \"Caribbean\" like the Olive Garden is \"Italian\", but if you keep that in mind, it's a pretty decent dining experience.  Conch fritters were long on fritter and short on conch, but tasty nonetheless.  Coconut shrimp tacos were actually quite good - a nice combination of sweet coconut shrimp and a tangy sauce with jicama slaw.  The menu was a little too long and daunting, and service was just ok - refills were a little difficult to come by.  For lunch with a gift card, I was quite pleased, but if I had saved this for a treat date night, I'd probably be a tad disappointed."}
{"text":"Great selection of food and drinks and always friendly service. They have a very good atmosphere for any type of event. Sometimes the service can be slow but that's the only downside."}
{"text":"I had the firecracker shrimp and the jerk chicken and it was just mediocre. The jerk wasn't spread around the chicken but there was enough food to fill you up. The firecracker shrimp were an attempt for the knock off bang bang shrimp and a few of the pieces were hard."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but Pittsburgh is too overwhelming for me to brave driving downtown at night.  Well, at least it was last night, so I headed on over to Robinson Town Center Mall,  or whatever it is called.  

Not so big on suburban chain places but I was starving.  Compared to where my hotel is, Robinson was the \"big city\".

For what it was - suburban chain place  - I give it 5 stars.  Had the Pan seared tilapia with rice and green beans. I enjoyed it. Felt pretty healthy too!

After I spend some more time in Pittsburgh I'm sure I will laugh at the night I ate in the 'burbs because I was too scared of the highways to drive to a trendier neighborhood.  But I will always be grateful that this place was accessible and open 'til 11 pm last night.  I don't think I could have handled another dinner of Fritos from the hotel's convenience shop!

P.S. The last time I ate at a Bahama Breeze was when I lived in Orlando.  Bahama Breeze was like going to Disney to dine without having to drive the extra 30 miles.  This was a nice little reminder of what it's like to \"feel\" the Florida.  Sigh... why did I move away from there again?"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place. For a restaurant in this area it should be a whole better. Our waitress was nice , but not too attentive to our table. The food had a lack of seasoning. The first dish I ordered was $18 , and had to send it back. Talk about bla! No taste. The second dish I ordered was a chicken Spinach dish. Same thing really could if used some salt and pepper . I would of rather gone to Applebee's! If your going to eat in this area ...go to another restaurant. This is the place of fine dinning and great food. No need to waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"We had an all over amazing experience here! Amazing food, great drinks, and the best service we had received anywhere in Vegas! Amazing and fun atmosphere, and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Ate here with the bf about 2 years ago I'm surprised I haven't written my review. Oh well better late than never right? 

We ordered the jerk chicken, coconut shrimp, seafood paella and warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake for dessert. The coconut shrimp was \"yummilicious\" (Maggie C I'm stealing your  adjective). Just the right amount of crunchy batter on the outside and plump and juicy shrimp inside. The jerk chicken was ok, I was expecting a little more heat, but then again that's just me and my taste buds. The seafood paella was the bomb. Not as good as my grandma's but close enough so that really says a lot. Of course I had to leave room for dessert. Warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. Need I say more? It's got three of my most favorite food in the world: chocolate, pineapple and caramel syrup. Yes warm and uber moist chocolate cake topped with juicy, tangy pineapple slice on a bed of gloriously rich and gooey caramel syrup. Love it! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"The happy hour is absolutely fabulous. Always have a nice experience when I eat here on layovers. Friendly staff and fresh warm food."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place.  I wasn't really hungry when we came here, but I was really looking forward to a nice selection of tropical drinks.  The selection was definitely there.  They had well over a dozen drinks.  A whole page in the menu, and a             booklet on the table.  Unfortunately, the two that I tried were pretty bad.  The first was a zombie.  This drink didn't look, or taste like any zombie I've ever had, and I've had a few.  I actually wondered if my order got mixed up somewhere.  Whatever it was, it was mediocre at best.  I thought a strawberry mojito would be a safer bet, since that's almost impossible to mess up.  Well...almost, right?  It looked, and tasted more like a bad daiquiri.  It was way too sweet, and apparently made with Pucker.  The only mojito thing about it was the physical presence of mint in the glass.  I tried a friend's cocktail- The Painkiller, and wasn't too into that either.  The mix of rum, and coconut cream is nice, but again, way too sweet.
The food was...okay.  Our friend ordered the jerk chicken, and seemed to really enjoy it.  We wanted to order some fish.  Three varieties were available, but they were out of the one that we wanted.  The salmon was cooked well, but the sides were not.  Gummy mashed potatoes, and oily under cooked green beans.  Oh well, at least they weren't frozen.  
I won't be rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Most of the time, this place rocks!  The happy hour specials work!  The Bahamarita is, by itself, a reason to come here.  One recommendation that is a have to if you like this place: sign up to get their emails.  Once or twice a year, they have free parties.  You can RSVP for up to five people.  They serve free food and drink.  The last one, they only gave you one free drink (in the past it was unlimited).  BUT I won a gift card to come back and dine.
For regular dinning, the coconut shrimp or the seafood paella.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is from 4-6 or 9-11p weekdays. There are plenty of $5 drinks and $5 appetizers as well. Food/drinks are tropical inspired delicious. Cajun shrimp and pina colada were my favorites. Very fun atmosphere. Try to get there early since it will get very busy. Huge parking lot and staff so friendly."}
{"text":"How the hell did I end up here for dinner?  $10 gift card and a $10 off coupon giving us a cheaper meal here than at Marie Callenders.  

And better food to boot.  I got the grilled jerk chicken which wasn't jerk at all...just grilled chicken w/ a fruity glaze and some pineapple and mango underneath it.  Tasty but I could never justify paying $16 for it.  My wife got the chicken santiago which was a lot better than mine and probably what I would get if I did do dinner here again.  Its also great that they offer lighter portions so we didn't have to bring anything home in a box as usual.  

The place was packed!!  I guess this is a pretty popular place?  Drinks were ok and fairly priced.  It would be a great place for happy hour if they had one.  I think doing drinks with multiple appetizers would be the way to go next time."}
{"text":"My waiter was great thanks Adam, but who ever the cook was didn't know what came on the plate. My plate looked nothing like the plates of past dinners I was a little disappointed because when you have your mind set on that meal that's what you expect sadly I wouldn't suggest it to anyone unless there going for happy hour."}
{"text":"They have added some vegetarian options to their menu, but it's still seriously lacking vegan options. The veggie burger is so bland... Play-doh has more flavor. 

However, my carnivorous family loved their Jamaican Jerk wings & onion rings. Also, they had happy hour specials on some of their food items, so it was 1/2 off the wings & onion rings. 

Nice atmosphere, lovely decor. They have live music some nights. 

I wish they'd offer more vegan options."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere the bar the bartenders everyone is really friendly and nice. Their food is so good! I always have to get their lump crab stack and also their lobster and shrimp quesadilla ! They have late night half appetizers off sun-thursday for food! All their or most of their appetizers are half off and they are really good! I love their ribs and their fries also!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place last week. I live close by and we wanted something small to satisfy our appetite. We started off with some cocktails. I got the ultimate pina colada and she got the painkiller. All in all good but could maybe use a splash of rum to bring it all together. She likes spinach dip so we got that to start. Very creamy, hot and great. Like I said, we weren't really hungry and we shared the lobster Mac and cheese dish. Absolutely amazing. I've been in the restaurant industry for 10 years and it's hard to find a great spot without picking at everything but this was the exception. Well balanced flavors that can make you come back for more. We will be sure to keep coming back and bring more people with us."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! Can't wait to go again. Service was friendly, food was good. Easy location and easy parking.

Recommendations:
-Bahamian Breeze
-Bacon Cheeseburger
-Shrimp & Chicken Pasta
-Filet
-Potato Fries (? Appetizer)
-Coconut Shrimp

Basically, this is everything we ordered. And it was amazeballs."}
{"text":"It is one of the best authentic Caribbean restaurants in Metro Cleveland Area. The beverages there definitely made my family recall our happy time in Jamaica. The appetizer - lobster and shrimp Quesadilla disappeared in 5 minutes. My old daughter didn't like lobster at all before but this time was her first time to really enjoy it as an entree. Desert was delicious but we were all full already. I finished it next day and it was even still tasted not very bad. We will be back pretty soon."}
{"text":"Service was good and attentive, the seating was comfy and unrushed.  I had the Paella - it was gummy and tasteless, but my dining companion had the Jamaican Sampler and said it was a WONDERFUL meal and he would be back more often just to eat that.  The drinks are delicious (the Tamarind Margarita was soooooooo good).  Bottom line - food is inconsistent, but might be really good - and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I don't often frequent this place but now and then I will give it a try. Today's visit we had a very pleasant and helpful waitress. There is free Wi Fi here in the event you need it which is always a plus for me.

My girlfriend and I both decided to have one of the seafood specials of the day. We each had wood grilled tilapia covered with almonds along with a side of sweetened mashed potatoes and broccoli. Since we got there shortly after it opened it wasn't crowded but sure got crowded by the time we left.

The food was good and for a luncheon the prices were reasonable.It is not one of my better seafood entrees but passable. There is an extensive menu and they do have during the week lunch specials which you can choose an entree with either a soup or a salad.  They do have a bar area which we didn't take advantage of.

The restaurant sits off the road near the mall of Robinson where there are other restaurants in that same off shoot. So parking can sometimes be a problem.

Please note that this restaurant is a \"chain\" so you will find it in other cities as well."}
{"text":"Favorite place to have a zombie.  The Tilapia and Shrimp Oscar was very tasty, as well as the Buttermilk Chicken.  Key Lime Pie and Banana Nut Supreme were both amazing desserts.  Spring can't be far away."}
{"text":"Overall great experience!  Came for happy hour and got some half off apps- beef empanadas were particularly good, though it took a little longer for the apps to get out (probably because it was during happy hour).  The dinner food was also very good, the highlight was their shrimp and mahi bowl.  We also shared a banana nut bread supreme dessert which was also good.  Server did an excellent job- was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the Breeze, I'm a huge fan of really good black bean soup, no one does it better than the Breeze. They're version is low in fat, vegan, and pretty high in sodium, but so is most restaurant food. A bowl makes a great lite lunch and is rather filling.

NOTE* the rest of this review goes back to my pre vegan days.

The Breeze has the best shrimp 'n grits this side of New Orleans, I've had shrimp n grits in Bay St Louis, New Orleans, and Shreveport, and you just can't beat the fresh shrimp caught right out of the ocean, but Bahama Breeze makes up for it with tons of cheddar in the grits, lots of butter and cream too. The shrimp are good, not rubbery, they use 21-30 count shrimp and you get quite a bit. The creamy grits, the succulent shrimp, and the spicy coating on the shrimp is like a party in your mouth, it's not always available, the four times I had it, they were part of the nightly specials.

When I stopped here for lunch I'd always get a Cuban sandwich. They are big in Florida, it's hard to find them here. Delicious garlic roasted pork, salty ham, creamy swiss cheese, tart dill pickles, spicy brown mustard, all toasted on a pressed cuban loaf. Does that make your mouth water? It does mine! Wash this beauty down with a red ale or pale ale and you'll be thanking me for the rest of your life.

Bahama Breeze is one of the better restaurants from the Dardan Restaurant group."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the high-priced strip food then make your way over to Bahama Breeze. It's amazing how dramatically the prices can decrease even if you're only 2 blocks away from the strip. 

Save your money for the slots, check out Bahama Breeze. 

Great tasting food (I recommend the Calypso Shrimp Linguine)
Large portions 
Reasonable prices
Fun atmosphere
Clean restrooms
Perfect for friends and family

A solid 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Visited today, Sunday 2/24/18. I don' know if it's me or what but after not having gone there for quite awhile, I went a got the absolute worst waiter that I have had in a long time! First, I ordered an ice tea to drink Now I wear glasses, but, if I can see through a glass of ice tea, I know that it's not too strong, So after some wait, he brought me a Coke! Then after several return trips to see if we were ready to order, we did, so he could  go make someone else's life uncomfortable. He brought my companion's soup and when I asked where the appetizer was, he informed me that she ordered the soup ? No kidding AND I ordered an appetizer, but I guess that it doesn't come first at BB? Eventually, the appetized AND the entrees were delivered together? OK, make do! A manager (?) came over and asked if everything was OK, of course I like being served all 3 courses at the same time, it saves the waiter a trip. The waiter went into seclusion to pout and I had to walk up front to the bar to get a refill of the Coke. The waiter came to the table to ask if I needed a straw, NO I needed a refill! The food was good, as I remembered it being there, we ended up getting to go boxes. I did want to try a desert but, honestly, was afraid to take a chance with this guy! I  A terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Well its popular! I mean I have gone twice both off day, weird hour, it was crowded both times. The mixed drinks are great!, the food is typical, nothing special, atmosphere is good. Staff was very nice, but spread too thin."}
{"text":"I love Bahama breeze! It's such a fun atmosphere, you almost forget you are in Ohio. I love to order the fish tacos and the crusted almond tilapia along with their mashed sweet potatoes! My boyfriend typically orders the ribs and they are once of my favorites to try!"}
{"text":"I always have great service when I come here, although my attendance is more like once a year!  On this jaunt, we had fast and friendly service for a party of 7!  We arrived just as they opened for lunch and was seated quickly with all of the day's specials explained.  Drinks were quick to come and complete.  Appetizers awesome and the meal can't be beat!

The waiter was the best I've ever had and interacted with the boy better than anyone.  I will be requesting him again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a location for the \"meet & greet\" on the first night of our destination wedding weekend, and I was totally disheartened by the pricing of any and all on-Strip locations. While driving around, the BFF and I happened to see Bahama Breeze. I know, I know, it's a chain -- but it has a fun, vacation-y appeal, so we called from the car to ask about group events.

Options from the low $20s per person? Cash bar available? Sign us up! We swung in for lunch to try as many menu items as we possibly could. The tostones and coconut shrimp both made for very tasty appetizers, although the tostones were a little dry -- but once you add all the cheese and toppings, yuuuuuum-ola. We both agreed our entrees were good, although now I can't remember what Jess got (some sort of chicken sandwich?). I tried the tilapia and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was, and it came with cinnamon sweet potatoes! We even had dessert, fantastic dulce de leche cheesecake (with an excellent graham cracker crust).

I will readily admit that I would probably only normally give BB more like 3 stars; however, this location was so upbeat and fun, the staff members were all so friendly and helpful, the drinks were so cheap... that I'm bumping it up. AND, it looks like it will be the perfect place to host a meet & greet, so if you're looking for a group event place, I'd definitely consider it!

P.S. One other reviewer mentioned the bathrooms, and I will ditto that. They're beautiful. Weird, I know."}
{"text":"Although a little awkward, our server was very attentive and thoughtful. Didn't catch name but young black thin gentleman. 

The food was amazing. Best cheesy, chain restaurant EVER!

Highly recommended over Friday's, RUBY TUES, Quaker steak, and others in this price range."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in town. I love the variety of island dishes. Highly recommended the fried Yuca cheese bites, buttermilk fried chicken and the Mac and cheese is amazing. Drinks are tasty and the staff is usually pleasant aside from occasional unhappy employee but they definitely do their best to provide hospitable service."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place to eat in Vegas !  Food was soo good and service from Tina was superb.  Only thing was that the drinks was a bit light on the alcohol but they quickly fixed it with another.  The place is busy but the times with good people made it fly by.  Definitely would recommend this place to anyone in Vegas and would come back again.  Too bad California can experience this place but would do well if there is one!!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and food was great. The menu provides a wide variety of food. I would recommend this eatery to anyone that enjoys islands."}
{"text":"We LOVE this joint and make a point to go every time we are in Las Vegas!  The food is consistently good and the service has always been wonderful.  You can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  I had the scallops on corn cakes (a special that day) and my husband has had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken the last two times and loved it.  Also the Cuban Bread appetizer is so good.  At then end of dinner I ordered the Almond Mocha coffee drink but had them add their brandy butterscotch sauce in place of the chocolate syrup. OMG the drink rocked!  You have to like sweet coffee, but it was soooooo good!  Casual dining, awesome atmosphere, great servers; a bit pricey but worth every penny!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After reading great reviews on yelp and online, my parents and husband and I came here for dinner. Jesse,our server, was knowledgeable and very patient with us as he made recommendations that would accommodate my dad's special dietary needs. He made great recommendations for tasty foods. Even though it was a Monday night, our food and service was great. Thank you! Definitely try the Jamaica sampler Platter!! It has the best of everything! The beef empanadas are also to die for!"}
{"text":"Bahamas Breeze really is a local gem for Las Vegans. The ambiance is laid back and tropical. They even have a small water feature running the length of the Restaraunt. The staff are all polite and I have never had a bad experience here. In addition, the staff will do anything to make your visit enjoyable (including singing and dancing for my crying 3 year old). 

The drinks here are reasonably priced for the size - they are quite large! And not to mention mixed very well. They taste like kool-aid and, according to my husband, are quite dangerous on the intoxication meter as you can drink and drink as of there were no alcohol - until you stand up from your seat. 

Food: I personally love the jerk chicken pasta. The asparagus and mushrooms work very well with the spices of the chicken and the pasta sauce. The husband loves the chicken salad, and the burgers here are also very good. The portions are large, so a single entree is enough to share between 2 adults, which is nice. 

I think Bahamas Breeze is one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Off the strip. Not too expensive. Good for families. And the food quality is high."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some coworkers. We work in the Howard Hughes center so it's a convenient place to go for lunch. I was not very happy with the service we received. My friend is vegan and asked if she could make her own salad and the waiter said no and he didn't seem like he was in a good mood...then my other friend asked him what is in the seafood chowder and he said \"it's creamy.\" uhm, yeah I am aware that chowder is creamy but what is in it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt on that because I just assumed he was new and maybe didn't know. 

I orders the tortilla soup and lobster quesadilla. I've had it before and it has never failed. When I got my food, a ton of the soup was spilled out onto the plate that had the quesadilla so my food was all wet and soggy. I posted a picture of it.  I didn't send it back because I was here for lunch and didn't have time to wait any longer because I had to get back to work for a meeting. 

I've had some pretty decent experiences here and the food is pretty good. It's a shame that my last experience here was not great. It could have been that maybe the waiter was new, but who knows."}
{"text":"Have always liked Bahama Breeze, We love there pasta dish's and of course are big fans of the Half price happy hour Sunday - Thursday.  You can not go wrong with that deal.
Being a member of the email club you will receive a $10 off coupon about once per month."}
{"text":"Great service by nicky! Shes very sweet and attentive waitress ! But horrible attitude by maya the host. Very nasty attitude since we arrived till we cashed out like shes in a bad mood . Your a host your suppose to greet people girl not have a \"I have diarrhea face\"  . But everytime i visit vegas this place is a must go ! Great food."}
{"text":"Not bad for family dinner out. Tilapia was good, sides were decent. Drinks were ok. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour. The bar was full but as we were on our way out, a bartender, Wayne, stopped us and said he was setting up outside. Wayne, couldn't have been nicer he knew exactly what we needed (drinks, food, water, check) and we never had to ask for anything.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Our favorite in Veggy!! 

I love the Salmon Tostada salad! The lunch portion of the Fresh Fish Combo is also perfect! Love the cinnamon sweet potato mash!! 

This time we did the cocktail flights. I had the Hooch and Holler one ... It was so good. I hate drinks that have stupid names but this is basically like 3 shots. It was so good : ) lol. 

No wait on Friday afternoon and so much parking!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about 10 years decided to try out happy hour which is mon-fri 4-6 and sun-thurs 9- to close. Appetizers were 1/2 price and certain drinks were priced lower. Got the habanero chicken wings the barbecue sauce was too sweet and there wasn't any real heat to it wouldn't get it. Jamaican chicken wings were ok very strong jerk spice might get again. Next up was the chicken quesadilla not much meat inside was ok. The lobster and shrimp quesadilla wasn't any better wouldn't get either one.  Crispy onion rings were good would get again. The crab cake was decent probably get again. The lump crab cake was a cold dish but tasty i would get this again. We also got the steak Oscar which is a sirloin steak with crab meat on top with mashed potatoes and asparagus decent. Virgin pina coladas were awesome definitely get again. The service was great.  Overall the food was blah, drinks were great and service was good."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and it was great! I recommend the nachos, seared ahi, and spinach dip! The nachos were really good compared to yard house nachos.. they tasted like curry lowkey but i didn't mind LOL. Drinks and service was good! BUT MY FAVORITE THING WAS THE DESSERT. I forgot its exact name but it was the banana nut one. It was like banana nut bread with a butterscotch sauce, vanilla ice cream, and candied almonds. Our server recommended it and I was so glad he did. Definitely coming back for this dessert 10/10"}
{"text":"This is a place that has been here for a while and although off the strip a bit it is a nice place to get some food and a drink without all of the drop froo crap that resides in the strip these days. They can make a good steak and it doesn't cost $60!!! Drinks are pretty basic, stick to the menu. Lindsey was great and tried to fulfill my more exotic drink requests but just doesn't have to back bar to be a real cocktail bar. She does make a very respectable Manhattan"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood to hit the beach but it happens to be January in Pittsburgh, this is my go-to. True Caribbean feel. Fresh seafood entrees, refreshing fruity drinks and tropical decor and music! Recently came here with a party of 6 and I was so impressed that the waitress was able to memorize all of our orders without writing a single thing down, she didn't skip a beat! This place does get crowded so be wise about what time you go."}
{"text":"The tranquil setting and delicious fare at Bahama Breeze was a perfect selection for a lunch outing with my husband. This location was a hot spot for refreshing beverages and appetizing eats for night outings during my time in college, and never disappoints. I love the lunch specials, dinner selection, and island  ambiance here. Our server Dave was really nice and attentive. We will return!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We were a group of 10 and we didn't really have any problems with our orders. The food is delicious! The staff is really nice, depends on what time of the day you go to, though. We went during lunch, and it was packed but nothing I couldn't enjoy. I really wish they had this place in California!"}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp is tasty.  The tuna salad is really good.  However, most of the menu can be acquired at Red Lobster for about the same price and even better quality.  There is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian.  I would not recommend this place to someone craving seafood, as the quality and freshness are questionable.  Go to Red Lobster instead!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk sliced chicken breast with bow tie pasta in the smaller portion. This was excellent I would order again. My husband had a burger with bacon and cheddar which he says was excellent. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and wouldn't recommend this. If the drink was better I'd of given it a five star. We will return next month."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and appetizers! Can't wait for the main course

UPDATE: Sorry it took long. But the Caribbean food they serve, I would say is good. I would definitely visit them again to checkout the other items"}
{"text":"Dionne took care of us. She was very nice. Kia was pretty dismissive of us and an issue we brought to her attention. 

The Breeze cheese bites were nice and light, not oily. Loved the creamy (not spicy) dip. \"It's like a cheesy donut\"

Wife tried lobster Mac and cheese. 
She removed breading? But otherwise thought it was a good dish. 

The Bahamarita virgin was refreshing. 

The key lime pie was super!  A nice merengue crust 

The seafood chowder was way too spicy for us (we are wimpy about spice). I definitely tasted Cajun spice. The manager took it off our bill no problem. 

Our friend loved the mojito and said best in her life. She also liked Vieja Ropa sandwich."}
{"text":"The prices have increased, but they have added new menu options. I got here around 9:45 and left around 11:15. I ordered two margaritas, one spinach dip and one crab stack. The food was delicious as usual. The margarita wasn't the best, but it was tolerable especially for the price. I walked out paying $30 for my total bill with tip.  Leslie was my waitress and she was super nice and very attentive even with the large party she had to serve. This is my must come to spot every time I'm in Vegas. This is more of a local spot, but I feel like a local because I'm here everyone I come bringing other with me usually. I happen to be solo tonite, but I will bring others next time I come so that they can fall in love like I have."}
{"text":"When reviewing restaurants such as this one, immediately I want to lump it into a pool with other well known places like Applebees or Fridays simply due to its uncanning ability to seem mediocre. When you walk into Bahama Breeze, I can honestly say you will not feel like you are soaking up sun on the beaches of the Bahamas but I can say you will feel like you are in a large wooden building with slightly depressed servers all the while wondering why the ceiling fan is on in the middle of a 20 degree day in January to which you would later conclude that it's reasoning is to uphold the latter part of the establisments name. (That was a long sentence...pheww)

Well moving on, the food was pretty snazzy, I recommend the spinach dip since it was like giving your tongue a full massage. The beer was pretty normal..nothing special. I will say since there was no one there, I was asked if I was okay about 5 times..and that my friends is a new record. 

If you are in the area and like places like this..check it out, it's worth a glance."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!from food to the drinks. Heres what we ordered.

Jamaican jerk wings - oh so good as always!we ordered extra bbq sauce!

Jerk chicken pasta - yummyyyy

Lobster mac and cheese - the sauce was so delicious. 

Lobster and shrimp quesadilla - yummyyy

Virgin piña colada and mango beach!yummmyyyyyy"}
{"text":"Went here for a free lunch with my buddy who lost a bet. Place was pretty empty for 11:30am. Its a huge structure with a nice bar area (where we were seated). Service was pretty good, ice teas refilled 3 times during the meal.

My friend ordered conch fritters for an appetizer, a salad, and lobster tacos. I went for a salmon cooked my way, wood flame grilled and almond coated with a lemon butter sauce, side of mashed sweet potatoes, and green beans.

Food was just ok in my opinion. Portions were good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salmon because they put a lot of almond and other stuff on it, which took away from the flavor of the lemon butter sauce and the meat. The conch fritters were good, but a little greasy...never had them before so maybe that's the way they are supposed to be, but I was expecting something a little lighter.

I'd love to hang out at the bar sometime and enjoy some tropical cocktails. I don't think they ever seem to get very busy. 

Not sure I'll return....seems there are more options and better places to eat, but it was a decent meal for about $18 (mine) and an overall bill of $38."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY.
Tropical drinks & delicious food. As you walk in, you feel like you're on an island. Came here for happy hour with a girlfriend and it was both our first time here. We were seated outside, which by the way, wasn't really outside, just another room in the restaurant that had an outside vibe to it. 

We ordered lots of different appetizers and drinks since it was 50% off. We had the Jamaican wings, crab stack, seared ahi and firecracker shrimp. The Jamaican wings were so crispy and juicy. It was accommodated by a bbq sauce (5/5). The seared ahi was ok. It lacked a little flavor (2/5). The firecracker shrimp was the same. It was just a fried shrimp with a spicy mayo dipping sauce (3/5). But the crab stack was heaven!!!! It was mango and avocados with crab meat and shrimp with a sweet savory sauce. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it right now!!! (5/5) it is definitely a must try!! They use REAL crab meat. YUMMMMM

Our server/bartender I forgot to get his name... but he was great! He constantly checked up on us and was the one who actually recommended that delicious crab stack. I had no problems with him whatsoever. 

Good food & good service!!! A place worth trying. I will be back again for happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Great value here. Seated quickly, great and friendly service and good, casual food."}
{"text":"I was probably one of the last people in the area not to have dinner at Bahama Breeze. My family and I visited tonight. We were seated quickly, having made a reservation on Open Table. Service was outstanding. Our waitress led us through the menu. Drinks were promptly refilled. Servers were professional, pleasant and engaging. The food surpassed expectation. The jerk chicken was perfectly seasoned and not overdone or dry. The shrimp linguine wasn't too heavy. It was tasty and plentiful. Prices are reasonable. The reggae music added a nice atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Jordan and I were once big fans of Bahama Breeze.  Their menu was always unique and does offer some healthier options.  Since we live in ShadySide, anytime we found ourselves out in Robinson, we had always made it a point to make a stop.  Our most recent visit, we have both agreed, was our very last.  
If you have read my reviews, you may know that I do not like to give bad reviews based on just server performance.  However, it was the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE that has inspired us to give up Corporate Chains like Bahama Breeze completely.
We went on rainy Labor Day Monday.  Since I was once a server, whether it's nice our or whether it's crappy out, Labor Day is ALWAYS busy.  People are off and don't want to cook - plain and simple.  Apparently their manager just got hired yesterday because they were extremely under-staffed, and the energy of the place showed it. 
First of all, the hostess that greeted us was visibly irritated that people kept flowing through the door; but quoted us a 20 minute wait.  We waited for 60.
Still, being understanding and patient, we let the mis-quoted wait time slide, even though other patrons were getting more visibly irritated at this fact.  
When we were finally seated, we were seated at a table that faced the open kitchen.  I don't care where we sit - I really don't.  I always appreciated the Open Kitchen at Bahama Breeze; therefore, servers and line cooks couldn't engage in \"bad habits\" or bad food practices.  NOT SO ON THIS OCCASION!   We watched plates being stacked on top of other plates in the window (WHAT?!?!  SERIOUSLY!?!?  I would have been fired from 5 restaurants if I would have done that); we watched servers eating french fries and shrimp right off of people's plates on the line (which I have seen people get fired for!).  Then, after watching servers eat off the plates, they would touch their faces, and then grab the plates to take them to the tables.
While waiting for our server, I hate to sound snobby, but every single server looked like they hadn't showered in a week; therefore, whomever was going to serve us, I was going to be grossed out by their lacking appearance.  Every single server, contrary to the frantic kitchen, was a slow-paced tortoise not giving a crap about the food piling up in the windows, the Expo yelling for food runners, and some guests still not having CLEAN silverware.  Every single server, male or female, was very un-kept, all had hair in their faces, and chewed food in front of their tables.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww. 
When our server finally did greet us - OMG she was way over-perky.  Annoyingly perky, scripted, and high-pitched.  When she finally took our food and drink order, our waters came right away; however, it took a few minutes for Jordan to get his beer.
*(Oh - and did I forget to mention that even during the long wait - that there were still about 20 open tables and 6 servers standing around?*)
Then the wait for the food.  Jordan and I (who actually met working together as line cooks, 4 years ago) just watched the kitchen drown frantically.  Then I watched the Manager jump on the line - and that's when I knew it was all over from there.  When ANY Front of House manager jumps on the back of the line - just watch out.  Your food is going to SUCK!  Especially when every ticket that comes in, the Manager rolls his eyes.  Um...that is your job isn't it?  To make food and serve it to guests.  If you're rolling eyes dude...then PLEASE do the guests at Bahama Breeze a huge favor and leave and find a different calling.
Also - if Bahama Breeze is going to rock the Open Kitchen in the first place - that kitchen better ALWAYS run a tight ship.  Plus - the windows through that open kitchen should at least look they were washed in the morning.  Not caked on grease that hadn't been touched in a week!!!  Does anyone do sidework there?  The mistakes that we saw MAY NOT been so bad, or disgusting, had we not seen them.  But since everything was in plain sight, it made it that much worse, and hard to swallow when we did finally get our food (literally).
We saw our plates get put on the line.  And then we saw them sit for 20 minutes.  Without even an extensive knowledge of the menu, Jordan and I probably could have taught their kitchen a lesson or two.  We just watched our food sit there while the Expo and multiple servers just walked pass.  Not their table, not their problem, right?  
As we watched our food just sit in the window, our server came over to us and asked \"So how is everything going?\".  Ummm...we really didn't know how to respond - did she really not see we had nothing in front of us besides two waters and one bottle of beer?  I said, \"Oh the water is delicious.  Where is our food?\"
Finally a different server ran out our food and informed us that the plates were \"really hot.\"  Yeah I know - I saw them sit in a heat lamp for 20 minutes.  
Food tasted dry...like it had been under a heat lamp for 20 minutes.
Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Monday Thur Thursdays they have awesome happy hour specials. I love the coconut shrimp and artichoke spinach dip. The wings are huge but looks too spookie for me. 
The drink special are yummy too. There house drink is slushy and yummy.
Great place to get your happy you on with friends or family."}
{"text":"Ok, for a chain restaurant this is very consistently good. Jamaican treat was great, rum drinks were very good."}
{"text":"We were happily surprised by our experience here. This place has a fun atmosphere, good service, and great food. We had the Shrimp and Lobster Linguini and the Shrimp and Grits, and got the Cocoanut Shrimp as an appetizer. Everything was really nice, and there were so many appealing menu choices.  I was a big fan of the creativity that went into the dishes and all the nice flavors. Really nice service, great portions, lots of shrimp and lobster, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Bleh.  We made the mistake of stopping for lunch at a chain restaurant. Bland food, over priced, dirty. However, our server was very good."}
{"text":"Our family reunion was here today and must say...I am highly disappointed at the service. Ordered were confused, mixed up and our table ordered firsts, but delivered 55 mins later. All bad. All horrible. Never to return."}
{"text":"pretty good, very standard food, but not so standard decor. I went here with my dad after a convention at the las vegas convention center, and saw lots of other convention goers there too. Service was good, food was decent, and you get raw sugar sticks in your ice tea. I forgot what I ate, but the pina colada was super sweet."}
{"text":"First off I have to say Anthony is amazing and when you visit here ask for him by name. His personality and attention to detail is top notch. On to the food. We ordered the shrimp and lobster quesadilla which was solid along with the sampler. The wings were tasty and had good heat, the coconut shrimp were good along with the conch. She ordered Mahi Mahi special and loved it. I had the steak Oscar. Steak was cooked to order and crab was decent. 

For our drinks I ordered the red lager and she had a coconut mojito. The beer was good and not overpowering but the mojito was solid. We didn't opt for desert after all we tasted but can't wait to return."}
{"text":"It was another enjoyable meal at Bahama Breeze!

A bowl of Bahamian Seafood Chowder was good and creamy, but warm rather than hot.  Peruvian Corn Cakes bristling with kernels of yellow corn were quite tasty slathered with butter and topped by a vibrant and fruity housemade Pineapple Salsa.

A Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves and sheets of Mozzarella Cheese was graced with an excellent Caesar Dressing.  And, an abundant portion of sauteed Mahi Mahi with Shrimp Saute in Lemon Cream Sauce that was presented with fine Spanish Rice was moist, flakey, perfectly cooked, and delicious.

Once again, 4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely wonderful experience here. The host immediately greeted us and sat us to a table. Our server, Taylor, was very friendly, offering up various menu options and being patient as we took a longer time to order since it was our first time here. Our food was delicious and came out quick and hot! I literally had no complaints! 
But the part that made me very happy was the fact that the host made sure to check on the servers before seating them so that they had enough time to care for each guest. I work in the restaurant industry and to see teamwork like this is rare to be honest. You can tell they are working together, and looking out for each other, as well as the restaurant. I can't wait to come back!i"}
{"text":"Always frendly bartenders drinks are super gooooood OMG this is the best i had and the mojitos always excellent today i try the real pineapple piñacolada the whole pineapple is soak in rum sweet n strong of course..
I  be back !!! ,Terminator voice"}
{"text":"This has always been a family favorite  for years . But last two times we have been disappointed  not so much with the food but the service  When we are out to eat I don't want to listen  to the waitress complain about who left the dishes there and would  like  to see her once in a while. At our table And they should train their people  not to hand a hot plate to anyone  especially  a child"}
{"text":"Food is so good here. I had the swordfish last night and it didn't disappoint! The coconut grande dessert was amazing as well! We love the ambience here. Island flair with live music that makes you feel like you're on vacation."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this place is great I made a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday the staff there is very nice very friendly they even go through the menu with you if you're a first time customer they offer you drinks right off the top and the service is very fast and friendly the food came out shortly after we received our appetizer very presentable on the plate very tasty and exactly what we ordered because it was my girlfriend's birthday they found a man in there who actually has a very nice voice to sing her happy birthday and bring out the pie that she ordered I would definitely recommend anybody coming to Vegas that's never ate at Bahama Breeze to stop in and definitely try their food everything on the menu is very appealing and looks very good our waiter was kind very friendly and definitely deserves a tip that we left him I would say for locals this restaurant is perfect tourist as well it's right near the strip"}
{"text":"Took the kids on a Thursday night to try a new restaurant!  I was very surprised by the size of this place.  The decor is super fun and you feel like you are on a tropical island!  Maria was our waitress and she was awesome!!  

Food reviews:
Skillet simmered jerk shrimp - the sauce was delicious, the shrimp was ehhh!
Habanero Chicken Wings - My husband and the kids loved them!
Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken - A lightly grilled chicken with a light marinade-lacked flavor
Seafood Paella - The husband said it was good.  Large portion.
The kids had sliders which they enjoyed.  Kids meals are only $4.79
Yaka Hula Drink - Super strong!
Bahamarita - Yum Yum!
Chocolate Pineapple upside down cake - Awesome!

I will be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great first impressions---welcoming cantaloupe-orange and vanilla exterior surrounded by many colorful, healthy-looking, well-maintained outdoor plants and flowers.  (If neglected, would have been a bad sign.)  Inside, an inviting, up-beat, spacious, expected tropical-theme, with dimly lit and bright areas, and a variety of green plants clumped into groupings throughout.  Other servers may be fine, but we lucked out with ASHLEY.  Friendly, smiling, knowledgeable, and very likeable.  Ask for her section, and see for yourself.   (When we were ready to leave, she said she hoped we'd be back.  \"But only if YOU'LL be here.\" I answered.  She giggled, then said to please ask for her.)

If not famliar with Caribbean dishes, I'd suggest viewing their menu online before stopping in---unless you'll have time to take time.  Many photos, too.  We aren't familiar with \"authentic\"---except for the couple of times my husband brought wonderful Cuban sandwiches home from Puerto Rican business trips---so that's what we did.  Their site also has a very helpful \"All about Caribbean Cuisine\" tab.    

Being new to this style---and looking forward to trying---unfortunately, we weren't transported to Nassau or Montego Bay.  We were still in Beachwood, sitting in a booth. ... UNTIL tasting their luscious portobello sandwich.  We were still here, but I think Bob Marley's ghost walked past our table.   And the disappointments could have been our choices---some dishes might not be our \"thing\".   You just might love it here---as many reviewers attest.

~~~~

JAMAICAN CHICKEN WINGS   1 star
First time trying jerk.  Whatever Jerk seasonings were used---apparently there are several variations per their website---the results didn't taste good.  Very large, too.  More like turkey wings.  These are older, big chickens, which I feel are best used for slower stewing/braising along with other ingredients, which helps flavor elderly birds.  Smaller, buffalo style, remain our preference.  

CONCH FRITTERS   1 star
First time trying conch.  Nice mild flavor, but if conch pieces were mixed into the batter, they weren't visible.  Still don't know what conch tastes like---or maybe they taste like dough.  Looked just like dough.  Good dipping sauce.

FISH TACOS   2.5 stars
First time trying ANY fish taco.  The flavor of the delicate mahi-mahi and other ingredients, were lost to the aggressive cilantro. The flour tortillas may have been just warmed up in preparation for filling, but had then cooled and firmed up.  This method---inevitably---and anywhere, not just this restaurant---can end up chewing like cardboard, and tasting like it, too.  When I prepare any dish using tortillas I either bake them along with the other ingredients, or fry them separately.   Even though I'd expect these tacos to be much better with less cilantro and quickly deep-fried tortillas---for that crunchy/tender/blistered combination---we'll never become fans of fish tacos.   We love fish and tortillas---just not together.

SUN-DRENCHED PORTOBELLO  
& VEGETABLE SANDWICH, grilled   8 stars 
Excellent.   Caramelized onions and slices of portobello, soft pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce, with a wonderful sauciness and flavor---probably the melted Manchego cheese.   Heard of it, but never tasted Manchego until now---WOW.  (I'm going to buy this cheese.  Wish I knew the brand they use.)  It also had asparagus spears, which weren't listed as an ingredient online.  Cooked---but woody---so I removed them.  The bread---hoagie-shaped and generously-sized---was perfectly pressed, having a crispy, toasted exterior.  I definitely recommend it.  And If meat or chicken is your preference, I'd ask for it on this sandwich, it was THAT good.   If we ever return, I'd order it again.   Until then, I plan to try making it myself, since I'm a lot closer to my kitchen than Beachwood. 

BEAN AND RICE BOWL SIDE   2.5 stars
One of the choices offered with sandwiches.  Basic beans and rice---which I like and have prepared myself, but with other ingredients added.  Theirs had no discernible seasoning. 

BANANA NUT BREAD SUPREME   2.5 stars
Nicely-flavored dessert.  With a banana sliced in half lengthwise, vanilla ice cream, warm banana-nut bread, whipped cream, and hot butterscotch-brandy sauce.  Bananas were too firm---hard to cut into with a spoon.  Ask for a knife and
fork---or it might land in your lap.  Better yet, ask if they could saute the bananas to soften them.  That would make it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant 
When I want to treat myself or have guests come in to town this is the place that I take them 

I found this jewel many years ago and actually had thought about it over the years but could never find it again, after being here a week or two I happened upon it by mistake 
A fortuitous drive by 
Yay 

Now they are always BUSY and it's first come first serve so the wait can be very long 
If there's a bar stool empty, we opt for that as there is no wait 
Now service at the bar is extremely slow but again, this establishment is extremely busy so I get it 
In my opinion the food is worth the wait 

I always get the same thing, lobster and shrimp pasta 
NEVER disappoints 
I'm a garlic addict so I ask the chef for extra every time, it's perfect 

Was there last week and first time I've ever gotten a table !! Lol 
The waiter was very good, I had friends in town from France and he made them feel very welcomed 
Serving them first which I thought was just EXTRA !! ;) 

I will be back, and when I get visitors in town, even though this is 18 miles away (in Vegas there's a bazillion restaurants) this is the one we head to. And all my friends love it as much as I do 

Nice Ambiance, my only suggestion is to train their staff better 
When you check in at the door each time the staff of 3 that are there look overwhelmed and confused.... 
pretty much every time I go there however, they also informed me there's usually a 2 hour wait for a table, so I guess you can't blame them for feeling overwhelmed 

Cocktails and are very good, and in comparison to other establishments here in Vegas near the strip, these prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"This place is kinda depressing. I would normally never go here (or a place like this in Las Vegas) on my own but 'had to' because of a group of business folks I was with. They had live music but it was very drab. Happy hour had decent prices but the food was very underwhelming. Service was pretty horrible so we are assuming the girl was new or trained horribly. I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving."}
{"text":"It's freakin' 100 degrees in Las Vegas today, so my co-worker says \"let's try this place\" because he'd been here before and enjoyed the food.

I had to agree that the food was really good.

I ordered the Chicken Club Salad.  Fantastic and DELICIOUS!!!  Right amount of salad, bacon, cheese, dressing and chunks of crispy chicken!!!  Yum yum in the tum tum!!

For dessert, I had a slice of Dulce De Leche Cheesecake.  It was too good.  I could not finish it because I was full and it was very sweet.  This is saying a lot because I ALWAYS eat all of my cheesecake (I'll be working out a lot tomorrow morning in the hotel gym!!!!!).

Our server was friendly, polite and always checking up on us to see if we needed anything else.

Next time I'm in LV, I'll try the clam chowder.  I hear it's very good.

FYI - bathroom was clean.  There was even mouthwash and hair gel near the sink.  Really."}
{"text":"I love the seafood paella it's not too salty perfect! & the sesami seared ahi taste good and fresh!"}
{"text":"My party shows up, we tell the hostess we have a party of nine and after I said I didn't have a reservation she seemed like she didn't want to deal with me. Reluctantly she said the wait was fourty minutes. A few minutes later another member of my party showed up. After I said the weight was 40 minutes, she went to go ask again to double check. When she came back she said the hostess rolled her eyes and was sassy when she said the wait was still 40 minutes. They seated us in 40 minutes, I didn't mind the wait because we did have a big party but I thought the service was bad.
I've been here several times before and I love the ropa vieja sandwich and any of their flavored lemonades. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich again. It came out in a reasonable time, but it tasted awful. The bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved. Normally the meat is tender but this time it was tough and it almost hurt my jaw to chew it, and certain parts of the sandwich were cold. My raspberry lemon breeze tasted like it was powdery and way too sweet. Our waitress was nice but she didn't come back until it was time for dessert. We ordered a key lime pie. If you like eating straight up sugar, you'll love this dessert. The crust tastes like hardened brown sugar, it melts in your mouth. Which I would like, but it was way too sweet. 
Needless to say, I'm not sure I will come back to Bahama Breeze. Or at least not with a group or when it's busy. But I'm not sure if I want to pay for rude service and bad food with decent dessert and drinks."}
{"text":"So me and my Honey Anniversary was Yesterday 11-17-16 of 4 years. And I let him pick the Restaurant. At first I was A little skeptical because I never ate Jamaican food before. We arrive kinda late about 120 before closing. But to my surprise food was still very Fresh and customer service was on point. And by us arriving late it was happy hour as well. Omg their Drink is off the chain ... No complaints the food was everything. This place is a must!!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Bahama Breeze was not spectacular nor amazing. Food was good, nothing to write home about. I had jerk chicken which was not as spicy as I'd like but the side of rice and their plantains were very good. Service at lunch time was great, food came quickly, definitely a good spot for grabbing  lunch during a workday. If you're looking for real traditional Caribbean, don't come here. But if you want a chain style Caribbean version, Bahama Breeze is great."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp. Good!  Mahi fish tacos ....even better. Best Goombay smashes since we were in Key West...... Ding ding ding!!!!   Great job!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving BB 3 stars but it's a gift, believe me.  When my wife and I went to BB in Tampa, Florida back in March 2016, it was a super-awesome experience. The restaurant was superb, as was the food and service. This BB has A LOT to learn from the one in Tampa.  Best way to do this review is the good and the bad. Nothing was truly ugly, but a couple of things were close to not being able to get a date to the prom.

The good:
Plenty of parking
Told us 30-minute wait but sat us in 15
Food was decent
Service was decent
Manager came to the table to follow up on an issue

The bad:
Called at 5pm to make a reservation for 6pm and was told
all reservations must be at least 2 hours in advance -- shitty policy.
I thought the people who work at the host/hostess station could have
been way more friendly and receptive. Instead they don't even say 
hello or greet you. No eye contact.  They seemed more interested in
talking to each other than with the customers.
I ordered a pina colada. First one was not what I ordered. Second one
was a pina colada and it was HORRIBLE. Even my wife said ICK.
My wife ordered the chips and only got 1 type of chip when
it says 2 types of chips.
My wife ordered a dinner that is supposed to have edamame in it
but they did not put it in there.

We're not picky people or hard to please. We're usually pretty easy going.
But c'mon people, this restaurant should serve the dishes as described and not
forget to include parts of it -- FOR TWO DISHES WE ORDERED.
And wow, learn how to make a good pina colada. It's not rocket science, I promise.
The 2-hour rule for reservations is a corporate policy for all the BB's, so it isn't the
restaurant's fault per se -- but it still stinks.

We traveled 35-40 minutes to get to this restaurant.  While we wouldn't say the experience was terrible, we can say that it wasn't good enough that we would come back.   There's a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"The drinks are as expected, pretty good. It's nice island ambience gives it an easy going feeling. The service is ok, nothing special. Our waiter seemed impatient. The coconut shrimp appetizer is crispy delicious. The live music wasn't bad but I would love hear more reggae and Caribbean songs, instead of country or folk or pop. Definitely give it a go for happy hour."}
{"text":"Always love coming to Bahama Breeze! I have never had a bad meal here! Today we had the Jamaican Grilled Chicken Wings as an appetizer. The wing is the full wing and they are delicious! You can order in 4's or 8's! As an entree I had the Breeze Wood Grilled Chicken with a Citrus Butter sauce, Broccoli & Mashed Cinnamon Sweet Potatoes! Yummy!! The chicken was grilled perfectly! The broccoli was steamed just right and the sweet potatoes were mmm good! 
I had a bite of my husband's Calypso Shrimp Linguine and the shrimp was very tender and there was just the right amount of sauce! He also had a Barbados Rum Punch and said it almost tasted like the ones we had in Barbados! It was actually made with the same rum! 

We've been coming to Bahama Breeze since we lived in Orlando,  so about 15 years. Out there we would wait up to 3 hours(it was well worth the wait) on a Fri/Sat night! Was glad when they opened the one here that it was much bigger!! 

We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here, best prices for 65 party, amazing food,  so many drink options. Friendly and fun relaxed staff, we will defiantly be back."}

{"text":"Great live music and happy hour deals.  Felt like I was on vacation. Drinks and food were good. Service was a little slow though."}

Never saw the Vegas location so busy 
But we did get seats at the bar and sat with Taylor. 
My friend got steak and I got paella. 
We had the hibiscus margaritas and they were good. 
The paella was good. 
Saturday night is busy and crowded on Saturday night"}
{"text":"Appetizers delicious!!! Shrimp linguini delicious!!! Jamaican jerk chicken delicious!!! Cocktails superb!!! Service, ah-maxing!!! Great place for family and friends!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The theme was cute and the drinks were amazing! I went during lunch hours and I had the caesar salad/ shrimp and lobster quesadilla combo and both were delicious! I ordered the hibiscus margarita and it's an acquired taste but I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"We went there for a happy hour and had a blast. The service was excellent and super fast. Drink specials cannot be any better. I got 2 drinks as a matter of fact. Only 5 bucks each. I loved my pina colada with coconut. The food was very good too. We got coconut shrimp and crab stack which looked like a work of art itself. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad day, but hardly anyone in here, chicken crema was so over cooked, couldn't eat it. Bacon on a cheeseburger was almost raw. Ultimate margarita was not flavorful. Service was also slow... Wish it could have been better. Florida locations are much better!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner on a Saturday evening.  I was pretty excited to try this place as it came from a recommendation of one of my friends who had been here before.  However, I found the service here to be a bit spotty and lacking.  Despite it being early, our server was occupied with other things other than checking in to see how we were doing.

But, besides that slight nuance, and a bit of confusion over us wanting soup, and then getting bread, but then getting our meals at the same time as the said bread, I still liked the food.  My paella was delicious and so was my boyfriend's chicken and yuca. Their mixed drinks were also pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for Happy Hour.  Service was great!  The place is so much fun, live music, delicious margaritas and appetizers are 1/2 price!  Coconut shrimp, onion rings, street carnitas tacos, spicy jerk shrimp and Empanades all delicious!"}
{"text":"Delish! I had fish tacos which came with huge chunks of avocado and super scrumply seasoned black beans and rice.

Service was good, if a bit phony.

Bathrooms: Lotion, hairspray, AND mouthwash. I was bitching all weekend about how bathrooms should have lotion and voila! Also mouthwash is a totally nice touch, more places should have it.

If for any reason i'm lurking this part of Vegas again, I would return."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out. So long over due. Came here on a Monday night was a great time there was essentially no wait. This place is pretty big in size, there is bar, indoor and outdoor seating. Thy have good HH specials 1/2 off apps 9-12 and a lot of $5 drinks. Ordered the jerk shrimp app it's like a scampi def not what I expected but very good. The jerk chicken and rice meat was amazing and I just had to get the paella.. man it was amazing I am so pissed I didn't have a bigger appetite. The service and staff were all kind and attentive. All in all I'd go back for sure, so sad they don't have this place in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a huge fan of the place, but it is ok for large groups. 

I'd never heard of this place before I moved to Vegas, but my friend recommended it one night years ago for dinner. I had my reservations once I realized it was owned by the Darden Group, since I'm not a huge fan of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, but I held back on my complaints.

I've tried several dishes here over the years and some are hit or miss. The portabello mushroom sandwich lacked flavor and texture and it wasn't as hearty as I was hoping for. I tried a pasta dish on my last visit which I actually quite enjoyed, however.

Overall, what I really like about the restaurant is that it's a great place for groups. There are lots of spaces to socialize and and private places. I've even seen weddings and receptions held in the private area. They also have a great little happy hour."}
{"text":"Memoriesss, of when I was a wee girl and got hammered for the first time at a Bahama Breeze in GA. And also celebrated my 28th bday while on business in Orlando... And Now this location when my other flight crew showed up tipsy, embarrassed us by telling the bartender \"Just surprise me with any drink, but make it dark like my soul!\" (Then later SPILLED a drink all over the bar!) Anyway I throughly enjoyed the pinot with a \"light\" sized Mahi/Shrimp rice bowl and it was so friggin delicious. Lots of veggies, fresh and affordable. All ingredients for a four star+ review!"}
{"text":"If you like margaritas , you must try the margarita flight . Absolutely delicious!!!! As far as food the empanadas are also really good as an appetizer ."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Came here with a group of 8 people from work. Came in the girl (blonde hair) said it was happy hour then charged us for our drinks and said \"did he tell you that?\" She must have been training but she was the one who said it. Then she didn't offer to fix anything and continued to have a dirty look on her face the rest of the time. Thanks. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BIKINI APPLE-TINI, fyi :)

I had the salmon pasta that came with bread. It was decent, not terrible.
Hubby had and enjoyed the jerk chicken pasta.
Hubby's grandma had the seafood chowder and loved it.
We all shared the key-lime pie (which was my first time having it) and it, too, like the apple-tini was DIVINE!

If I'm ever back in Vegas (we came here right after we landed in Vegas), will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Eine nette Bar etwas abseits vom Trubel mit live Musik, angenehmes Ambiente, aufmerksame und freundliche Bedienung, empfehlenswert!"}
{"text":"Love this place.    Awesome drinks and food.   Coconut shrimp app was great.   Salmon tostada also great.    Super fresh and salmon cooked perfectly.   Christine B was a great server very helpful and quick and anticipated out needs."}
{"text":"Decided to try it because it was within walking distance of our hotel. Started out strange with the host commenting that we were different because my wife and I sat together in a booth instead of across from each other. Didn't get much better from there, server had to be asked several times for the beer that had been ordered, two rounds, two sets of excuses why we had to remind her. We were in a booth near the POS and got to listen to the disgruntled servers the whole time we were there. The food didn't make the experience any better, lacked flavor and seasoning. Would be hard pressed to recommend it based on this experience."}
{"text":"Always a good place to go. Can get fairly busy. I ordered the almond crusted fresh fish. The fish was fresh cut about a half inch thick with a salt and pepper taste with Allman crest and lemon butter sauce over.  Also my meal was served on a hot plate to keep fish warm and tasty The server was very polite and continued to ask us if we want to refills on our drinks. The service was more than acceptable. I left a 20$ tip."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow on a slow night. Food was absolutely horrible quality. Sitting at a business dinner, my boss sent back his epinadas. I ordered the pork tenderlion, and no joke, it was like a cheap flat iron steak. I choked it down because I was hungry. I would give this place negative stars if that was feasibly possible....."}
{"text":"So, one of the reasons I am drawn to this restaurant is the ease of getting here and the simple parking lot. However, I have been pleasantly surprised each time I come to this chain here in Las Vegas. I always get the fish in season, which comes with the chef's veggies and some sort of starch - my favorite being cinnamon mashes sweet potatoes. Every time, the fish is cooked perfectly and the service impeccable. So, for a fabulous, very reasonably priced lunch or dinner, and away from the craziness of the strip, this place is a nice option. Plus, there is always good music streamed in!"}
