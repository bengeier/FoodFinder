{"text":"This place has the best bbq duck in the GTA. I've had duck from a lot of places and this one is definitely the best. You also have to try their crispy skin pork. Yum"}
{"text":"I come here quite often when I dont have the time or energy to cook. Like any chinese bbq meat place you need to know your cuts of meat to get the best value or you will get too much fat on your bbq pig, your bbq pork will be too dry and hard or not enough meat on your bbq duck. Overall this place is great for takeout as I dont often see anyone dine in. The place gives me a feeling of oilyness or stickyness... if you know what I mean. Price is decent and they never hesitate to give you more sauce!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if the usual chef was sick or what. But something is totally a miss with the reviews at this sad little dive of a hole.  Absolutely the worst lemon chicken, BBQ pork and rice I have ever eaten. Ended up throwing it in the garbage where it rightfully belonged."}
{"text":"I guess only locals know this place hehe. Best Chinese BBQ place in Toronto. Cuts don't have too much fat like over at King's Noodle, and the pork is crispy and juicy. Strictly a takeout place."}
{"text":"They charge 15% on your bill it is illegal! 8% gst and pst 7% i thought that system was old school also on the recipes doesn't have their store name . So you dont know if they take all15% charge in their pocket   They should be shut down not charging us 13% taxes like ontario   They are very cheap on their sauce !"}
{"text":"Such an amazing chinese bbq joint. I went on a Sunday afternoon and there was quite the lineup. This was the second time I came here to grab bbq meat, and I was not disappointed. Bbq duck is one of my favourite foods since childhood. I can recall my brother begging for King crab, while I'd ask for duck whenever we ate out as a family (bless my parents!)  Not only is the bbq flavour done very well, but the meats themselves are well selected and prepared. I've had duck that was too fatty or didn't have enough meat on the bones. Here, many pieces only have a thin layer of fat, and unlike other places I've been, I don't get a whole takeout container of just skin and bones.   As for the crispy bbq pork I had, I was very surprised at how lean it was. I've never had crispy pork that was this lean, and I was slightly surprised. Perhaps the pigs are a little smaller than normal. Unfortunately I didn't notice which part of the pig the pork was from. I would've liked just a bit more fat, but I know some people have differing tastes! Flavour was still on point."}
{"text":"Came here for their bbq duck... it was pretty good.  One of the only places in the area offering Bbq meats."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese roasted meats. Yummy BBQ n Wok has been around since I was a kid. Now I'm no spring chicken with kids of my own, so time alone is a testament to how good their food is!  The place is primarily for take out but they do serve meals which consist of their roasts served on a  bed of steamed rice. Prices for a plate run under $10. They also have a very small seating area if you want to eat in.  The menu is kept to a minimum, but there is no need to expand, they perfected the things they sell. BBQ Duck, Roast Pig, BBQ Pork, and Soy Chicken, are the mains, and all of them warrant 5 stars. They also dabble in some other meat and veggie dishes to support the lunch menu.  There are many places that serve Chinese BBQ meats, including many restaurants that are now vying for that same buck, but very few have come close to these flavours. But individual tastes are very subjective as everyone has unique preferences. Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I grew up on these flavours, but it's always been the benchmark for which I compare all others. Try it after trying other places first and decide for yourself!"}
