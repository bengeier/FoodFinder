{"text":"Spider roll - $11.99 This roll was bigger than expected and I was definitely full from it. I was impressed with the crispiness of the batter around the softshell crab.  Service The service was good. We were given a complimentary pan fried salmon head which was unexpected and a nice touch."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the owners for this restaurant have definitely changed to a Korean family.   The sushi was average but maybe because I was having pretty high expectations from the pictures/reviews, I was left more so disappointed.   The sushi sizes seems smaller than average and the shape is oddly circular (refer to picture). The small platter is almost identical to some of the other pictures on Yelp (35.99+tax for takeout)  The place however though was really quaint, cozy and nice . A quiet place for a la carte sushi If you're around the area.   Overall it's been a more average experience and will be back if I'm craving sushi around the area"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend this past weekend after reading positive yelp reviews and I was not disappointed.   We ordered the small sashimi party tray  (30 pieces for $26) and they were very accommodating. My gf is allergic to red tuna and they let us swap for salmon free of charge. The tray also came with salmon belly, white tuna, mackerel,  octopus, and I think yellowtail. They also sell Bento boxes for $15 and less.  The place had maybe 8 tables and its a little hard to find, but the service was really friendly and the prices very reasonable for the quality of sashimi."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi for a great price! The lunch specials are very good and have a lot of good food for a great price. The atmosphere is very nice and a fun place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered several party trays for a lunch event and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and mix of the sushi and rolls. Had some difficulty finding a place that could have the platters ready for 11:45am on a Sunday. Most places opened only at noon and couldn't have it done until 1pm at the earliest, so this was a great find. Sushi4U was pleasant to deal with, did not need me to follow up, and had everything finished before the pick-up time. Appreciated the reliability because we were working on a tight timeline. The fish to rice ratio was better than other places I've been and the fish tasted fresh and came on a platter (ready to serve)."}
{"text":"Much cleaner and decent since it was a fish market in the beginning. However, compared to others, the value is steep. I tried the salmon sashimi a la carte and ordered 4 servings. The salmon was so thinly sliced it really felt like a ripoff. You can get a much decent slice of sashimi for the same price at Japanese Express in Pacific Mall. Even the Hwae Dup Bap has more sashimi slices than this place (Korean chirashi). If you want a better deal on sashimi, try Galleria Supermarkets. The thickness of the sashimi definitely affects the taste and this place is so cheap with its portions. Dare not to try others as the rating will be less. They need to improve on their basic menu first."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already.  Not too busy so seated quickly.  Friendly staff.  Sashimi is fresh.  Salmon teriyaki is moist. Tempura is perfectly fried... not oily and very crispy.  My only negative is the kalbi, good size pieces but could have a bit more taste.  Overall, good meal and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I came here based on other reviews on Yelp because Kiu Sushi at VIP Markham was packed and had a long wait list.  Unfortunately this place was not up to my expectations. Rice was pretty dry. Nigiri selection is limited. Uni had a strong fishy smell...some of the raw fish were dry. I did not order rolls, so I cannot speak for the rolls. But as a sushi restaurant, I must say that the variety of sashimi available for nigiri was surprisingly limited.   When I ordered a nigiri, the waitress told me they ran out of the fish. I said OK. Then the waitress asked me if I wanted to cancel the order...quite strange question to ask a customer after declaring the item is not available to order...  This is the second time I chose a sushi restaurant based on Yelp review and was disappointed...I guess I cannot rely on Yelp review when it comes to sushi."}
{"text":"Very consistent sushi quality. The cooked food is done well also. Large portions. Give the bulgogi a try!"}
{"text":"The owner changed since my last review. The quality of the sushi was good, but not as good as before (the red dragon roll was definitely not up to par). However, the quality of the fish was still fresh, but the service suffered a bit. We will continue to enjoy sushi here (one of the better restaurants in Scarborough/Markham) but less frequent than before."}
{"text":"Amazing fatty salmon sashimi, best I've had so far. I came here with two friends, ordered the medium sushi+sashimi platter and received a free cooked salmon which was pretty cool. The service was good and I found the pricing quite fair. I would caution people about the parking as it is limited. Otherwise, this is a great, unpretentious place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, nice presentation of food, and great service! We ordered a sashimi bento box and a few a la carte items: agedashi tofu, sake (salmon) sashimi, botan ebi (sweet shrimp) sashimi, uni sushi, and red dragon roll. The heads of the sweet shrimp were deep fried into a nice crispy treat!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed coming in and leaving. Always welcomed by the owners by a hot cup of green tea. Highly recommend spider roll and soft shell crab! For first timers, their bento boxes are very affordable with large portions of sashimi, sushi and rice!"}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, great service, and decent sushi. They charge a dollar extra for bento substitutions but I'm totally okay with that. The waitress was attentive and polite. Portions were generous and they had a good selection of fish for the sashimi bento as well. Tempura was crispy and the bento came with a miso soup and salad. Pretty solid place for sushi."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with approximately half a dozen tables.  A good selection on the menu for bento boxes and sushi and excellent service.  As well ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.  It's a very small place, tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across Pacific Mall at Steeles/Kennedy, but the food is delicious.  Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.    They even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!  The only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end, such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do, however I am very content with this place just as it is.  I will definitely be returning to this place whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for sushi. Came here with a group of 3 and ordered the 80 piece sushi tray. They also gave us a free fish head. The service is okay. The sushi came fairly quickly. The fish was fresh. But the variety of fish included in the sushi tray was rather limited. We had salmon, white tuna, red tuna, and mackerel.   The sushi filled us up. However, our bill came up to around $90. So for over $1 / sushi, I don't think we got anything amazing."}
{"text":"A small non-AYCE place with really good sushi! Fresh and artistically presented. I've been here twice and both times the servers were attentive and friendly. On my most recent visit we ordered two sushi combos that came with assorted rolls, nigiri, and sashimi along with salad and miso soup. Favourites included the spider roll as well as the salmon sashimi.   The location is pretty central to Markham/Scarborough at the intersection of Steeles and Kennedy. Parking may be a bit tough since it's in a rather small parking lot.   Definitely my go-to place when I'm craving sushi."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this little gem for a while now, and am only disappointed by the difficulty in finding parking at this plaza. If you arrive during peak hours, park at the gas station and cut across the grass, lest you find yourself making a 26 point turn to escape, whilst simultaneously being judged on your [lack of] driving ability by a grumpy curmudgeon, smoking on the curbside.  My automotive skills aside, this place has yet to disappoint. Arriving as a quartet on a Sunday around early evening (read: just before 7 pm) we were seated next to the window. A quick flip through the menu and we ordered (a) medium sushi and sashimi party tray, (b) chicken buldak (comes with miso soup, salad, and rice), (c) two glasses of tea, and (d) three glasses of water.  The spicy, savoury buldak was the first to arrive, sizzling away, excess calories in melted cheese oozing along the top. It is definitely something that is worth ordering... but probably not in conjunction with sushi. The flavours are bold and in your face, a stark contrast to other delicate flavours to come.  Blah blah blah, socializing, socializing, socializing. Waitress reappears... with... wtf... a... lazy susan covered in a selection of fresh, raw fish? It's like we're having dim sum or something. But it doesn't matter - it's time to dig in. The party tray comes with your standard assortment of sashimi, nigri, and rolls, all generously sized (i.e. no razor thin slices of salmon that could cut your tongue). Of particular note were the akami sashimi - fresh and sweet, leaving no metallic after taste, and the rolls (but I am a sucker for vinegared rice).  One other item worth mentioning is the grilled salmon head. The crispy, salty skin and moist, succulent meat was an absolute delight, and something that I would gladly order without hesitation. Our table received one complimentary - the waitress mentioned something about the party tray - but I did notice it on the menu and is something that I would order without hesitation.  TL;DR: Food's good. Parking's bad. Would come back."}
{"text":"Nichiban!! Both the service and the food is #1! The owner is so friendly. They serve us with the best ingredients! Saba with tobiko, what a treat! The sushi is just right in bite size! Elegantly done, just the way I like it!! While we have such a full belly with yummy food, the bring me complimentary miso soups and grill salmon heads! Everything is very authentic! Great choice in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Mostly do takeout from this place, but one day decided to stay and had their bento box.  Wow, so now I am order it every time I am there, tried them all and they all very good."}
{"text":"This place is decent. Not bad but not amaaazing! I Iike to come here just to order take out! They have quite a few tables. From my experience here, they are never packed. For take out, I definitely recommend ordering ahead of time just so you can quickly go in and out of this place. The parking lot is extremely limited and small. It's best to avoid during busy hours.. I always order the sashimi platter and they are always niceee and freshh!"}
{"text":"I'm going to echo the reviews before me and say that this is my go-to sushi spot if I'm in the area or even away from the area. ! The prices are average but what stands out is the quality of the food: it's delicious! The rice is nicely formed, seasoned well and at a good temperature; the fish is fresh and I normally don't like California rolls but I ate mine and asked my girlfriend for hers. I usually order the classic pieces of sushi but as soon as I'm off my diet I'm going straight for the special rolls, which I jealously gaze at the other tables. The presentation is also nice but that's just gravy or should I say tobiko. :)   The service is also very nice but the only downside is the parking."}
{"text":"My friends and I picked up two large party trays for 11 people. Total came up for $200 for about 240 pieces of sushi, sashimi and rolls. Pretty decent price for the food but nothing spectacular so don't expect too much.  Quick sushi fix and does the job. Will come back to order party trays when other options aren't available."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly so good. The service was absolutely AMAZING! It was definitely family-owned and you got that vibe. The food was super duper good. I got the Bulgogi Bento Set which I loved, everything was so flavourful. I never really like tempura other than the shrimp tempura, but they really made me like absolutely everything they gave me in that bento set. Everyones food looked great. I was in a rather large group (of 8), and they even gave us two salmon heads as a house treat, which was also fantastic. Super impressed with this place, and would definitely recommend it to anyone. A hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I know. I live in north york region but its the only place I go for sushi and it is worth the drive for sure. THE FOOD IS AMAZING, they take time and effort to make your food and they always use fresh ingredients and the presentation of the dishes are probably something you would expect from expensive restaurants. The waitress was very attentive to our needs and the environment of the restaurant was very clean and spacious for the privacy of the customers.  I would recommend Nichiban Sushi4U to any of the readers out there, the price is good for the quality of the food and their special rolls are outta this world."}
{"text":"I came here around lunch, the chef was dying his hair while making sushi for me. It was slightly disgusting the fact that you can dye your hair while making sushi.   I ordered the kalbi bento , the beef ribs was alright it wasn't anything special. It came with the sushi rolls , except I didn't eat it because I was disgusted by what I saw. Very unhygienic.   Probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"They changed owners about a few months ago. I've been back here 3 times after the change. I waited to write this review because I wanted to see the consistency on their quality.  Unfortunately I have to agree with some other reviewers that the quality and experience isn't as good as before. Don't get me wrong, it's still good but not like before. My sashimi slices are thinner. My friend's sushi pieces are smaller. The waitresses are still pretty attentive but because they are different every time you visit them, there's no connection.  One thing my friend complained about the  last time we were there is that they didn't really turn the AC high enough so we were boiling in this tiny restaurant eating sushi that was getting warmer and warmer by the minute."}
{"text":"The quality of sashimi is great, fresh and taste fresh Also as the California roll, good portion for me"}
{"text":"A hidden gem opposite to the pacific mall. Small but lovely, from the soybean sauce bottle and its stone pad, you can tell that they put lots of efforts into the operations.  The snow valley roll was yum! They put big chunks of avocado into the rolls, covered with torched white tuna and mayo, great flavor combo!  The yam roll was good too. My yam was not cooked through, but the thin rice & batter and teriyaki sauce covered that drawback.  Will revisit next time when we are around the pacific mall!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the takowasabi has such a kick to it, and my boyfriend and I always end up ordering their special - the 888 set which comes with sashimi, nigiri, and a special roll! For the Special Roll, I'd go with the Kennedy roll. Their tempura is average though."}
{"text":"A small little authentic place with fresh fish and decent prices. It's tight so probably not great for big strollers or people with wheelchairs. The sushi was beautifully decorated and presented. It was a wonderful time."}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi! A great selection of sushi and sashimi. The place is pretty small, about five or six tables but rarely gets too busy (not sure why). Parking space is also very limited. Service is decent and the food is always fresh and delicious! Price is also very reasonable. Lunch boxes are from $8! I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of people and ordered enough for five. We got a neat sashimi platter that came on a lazy susan for maximum reachability. We also had an order of the tempura. It was all very very good, and the sashimi was very fresh. The service was great. Will return!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday, it's a small restaurants (do not bring strollers in since there won't be any space), around 6 tables and a few bar seats. 4 out of 5 table were filled. Considered it's so busy and there is only 1 waitress, the service is a little slow. I find that it is the usual case in many small restaurants.  I ordered the Sushi A lunch special - California Roll and a few assorted Sushi. The combo comes with soup and salad. The soup is average, not much seaweed or tofu inside. Salad is fresh but I expected more with the salad dressing. The sushi is fine, the taste is a little on the salty side when I did not put any soy sauce already. Overall, it's an average restaurant for lunch. Might go back to give it another try for dinner since most of the reviews are based on dinner."}
{"text":"Fair quality of sashimi for a fair price but I feel that they could use more work on their maki rolls.   I ordered the small sushi and sashimi party tray for $43 (tax included) and it was just enough food for two, definitely not enough for three. There was a good variety of sashimi, all of which were fresh pieces of fish and regular-sized cuts. However, the california roll was mediocre and the spicy salmon roll was subpar because the crunchy bits were soggy and there wasn't a lot of salmon in it.  Overall, for $43, it's not the best deal. It's not bad, but it would depend on what you're looking for. If you're a sashimi kinda person, then sure. If you're a maki roll kind of person, then I'd probably advise you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on several occasions, and it is certainly one of the hidden gems of Scarborough. Nichiban is a small, cute, and cozy restaurant that serves fantastic food. When you first walk in, the staff all stop to greet you, already making you feel welcomed in their restaurant. This place has multiple chefs on site at the sushi bar, preparing to serve fresh & DELICIOUS sushi. I typically come here for lunch on Sundays around 2pm and there are usually not that many people.  However, on one occasion I was here at around 1pm, where all the tables were filled with other customers. If you're there during a busy time, be prepared to wait for at least 30 mins-1 hour to be seated, unless you want to sit at the bar (which is quite small). There is usually only one waitress on site (super sweet & always checks in on how you are enjoying the food), and it gets hectic for her to serve 5+ tables of people. As well, the parking is very limited in this hidden plaza, so beware of that. Despite those two cons, I love this restaurant. Their lunch specials end around 3-4pm so if you're a late riser, be thankful for places like Nichiban!"}
{"text":"I have never dined-in at Nichiban Sushi4U before, but I have ordered party trays to go a few times.  Walking in, it appeared to me that they have renovated since the last time I had visited. Instead of looking cluttered, the environment looked very clean and spacious. There were a few tables in the small establishment, but none of them were filled. It was 7:30PM on a Tuesday night and my friends and I (a table of 3) were the only ones there.  However, like I always remembered, the quality of their sushi is high and the ingredients that they use are all very fresh. It took about 15 minutes for our orders to come out, but I'd like to think that it was worth it because the presentation was beautiful! The waitress was very attentive to our needs as well.  Overall, I would give the place 4/5 stars because I feel that, although the sushi is quite tasty, the food and the service is not outstanding enough to justify over $1.15 a piece (after tax and tip)."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch on a weekday so it was fairly empty. It's kind of small and it has limited parking space.   Their lunch set is decent price. It comes with salad and miso soup. I got the sushi/roll set which is 20 pieces for $13.99  The overall quality of sushi was ok and depending on the fish, the quality differs. The salmon and butter fish was good and fresh, however the tuna was not good, having a weird texture...   Overall it was a good experience, good portion size and quality for the price being paid and friendly service even with only one server working that day."}
{"text":"I really liked the Snow Valley Roll!!  This arrived on a long and narrow tray.  There were generous bonito flakes on the top of this sushi.  I liked how the size of the sushi roll was perfect to squish one into your mouth.  I liked the sushi rice and the ingredients in this roll!  Turns out BBQ eel, avocado, and torched white tuna are all really great things to put together!  I really liked the garlic sauce too; it was slightly spicy but most importantly so creamy.  I like creamy saucy sushi rolls.   (I also didn't need any extra soy sauce or wasabi at all since the roll was already so well crafted.)  The Seafood Udon was as good as could be!  It came out steaming hot.  I loved the broth and how it was so clear and refreshing yet flavourful.  I could have drank all of this myself.    The udon noodles were firm but not too soft or chewy.  There were shrimps, mussels, clams, and calamari in the bowl.  The shrimp was just slightly overcooked for my taste but it was still decent.  The mussels and clams were good and I liked how the calamari wasn't rubbery.  Now I know why Nichiban Sushi 4 U is rated so highly online and why two people I know recommended this spot!  Other than the less-than-ideal parking spot (but popular area), I would definitely come here again to try more of their signature rolls and sashimi too."}
{"text":"Was here last week to grab a quick lunch with a friend. It was fairly empty, and the restaurant is small, however, the lunch specials are worth the price. We shared Lunch Combo B and C, and she had asked to change the California Roll in her special to Spicy Salmon Roll. The roll was nice and spicy! Lunch Combo C, my order, came with a Dynamite Roll, which tasted like it usually does. It also had several pieces of sushi. Very filling for a good price and the service was very nice."}
{"text":"Located at a tiny, dinky plaza on Kennedy and Steeles (on the scarborough side), lies this small sushi joint. Came here on a Saturday night craving for sushi but not AYCE. Got the tempura sashimi bento for 14.99 comes with soup, salad and some fresh fruit for dessert. The bento came with 13 pieces of fresh sashimi and some really tasty, crispy tempura. Although I'm not a fan of california rolls, this place managed to make them so that I actually enjoyed eating them haha!  The person I went with ordered the sashimi/sushi plate for around 15.99 and they enjoyed their meal too. The presentation was really nice, the food was presented on a wooden board with decorations such as a miniature fence and cherry blossom tree to mimic a garden. A+ for style points!!  The service is sort of slow, there was only one waitress and people were constantly coming in and out to pick up take out orders for sushi party trays.  I recommend this place to satisfy your sushi cravings without having to binge at AYCE places."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  Parking lot is small and around the back.  Restaurant is small but spacious; looks renovated.  Ordered the 888 Combo that comes with Sashimi (8pcs), Sushi (8pcs), Special roll of your choice (we picked Black Dragon Roll) and Nichiban Sushi that comes with Sushi (12pcs), California Roll (6pcs).   Sushi was fresh; good quality for price. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today.  The parking situation isn't very good, there is only a limited number of spaces.  We ordered the Mountain Roll, Tempura Bento and a Chicken Teriyaki Bento.  The mountain roll was nice, nothing amazing, but a nice solid roll.  The tempura, in the bento box was lovely. Not oily and crispy but not hard.  The worst item was the chicken teriyaki.  It was basically, a boiled tasteless piece of chicken breast, with just some sauce smothered on top.  Service was ok, the waitress was quite polite.  A nice place to go for some sushi but I wouldn't get the chicken teriyaki ever again."}
{"text":"We had Red Dragon and Dynamite roll, amazing taste and great presentation. Its a small and nice place, looks like a family run. Service and ambiance is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and I still think it's one of the hidden gems in the area! It's your hole in the wall type of place that is good for bentos  and fresh sushi!  I would suggest coming for lunch. Their lunch specials end at 4pm so if you're anything like me (late riser) then this is honestly a perfect spot! The parking is limited in this hidden plaza so just be aware of that."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place whenever I have a craving for sushi.  I usually order the Sashimi Donburi plate which is sashimi on a bed of vegetables and it comes with a side of rice, soup and a cup of hot sauce.  I usually order 15 minute prior to go picking it up.  The food is always ready when I arrive and they're always friendly.   You cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"First time here alone just to try it out. Nice little quiet place. But not very keen on quiet in a sushi restaurant. The fish was fresh and the service was good. But it would be my first thought if I want to eat sushi."}
{"text":"9 months later and the quality is still good! I think they did a bit of renovation, it's always been clean looking so I guess they tried to make it look more spacious?  The service is good as well!  Parking space is very limited tho."}
{"text":"Totally worth what we paid for! I'd never been here before and the small area/place did not seem to hold much greatness but wow! I'm super impressed with the presentation and quality of each thing we ordered, from the sashimi bento box to seafood udon. Completely worth a shot and/or frequent visits for satisfying your sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my parents and this place is on point.  A-la-carte menus are very reasonable.  We had the Med. Sushi/Sashimi Boat plus a couple of special sushi.  We were stuffed. I love this place.  Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"They have changed owners... Again.  The menu is the same with some changes to some prices.  Still Korean owned.   No complementary salmon head or Jap Chae anymore.   The miso soup is terribly salty.  Ordered the sashimi dinner bento, and the quality of the tempura, rolls and sashimi are still up to par.  The rolls are much bigger as 6 of them don't fit in the bento anymore.  The tempura are really fresh. Sashimi are cut into fatter pieces, but are stubby (little rectangle blocks)   For complementary dessert it was a small fruit cup with a blackberry, piece of honeydew and orange slice.   For the price and amount of food, it was pretty good.  3 1/2 stars due to salty miso soup."}
{"text":"We placed an order for take out from Nichiban Sushi4U, and we were very pleased with the quality and quantity of the food.  We ordered some Chicken Teriyaki dinner bento's and were very surprised at how many tempura pieces that came with the order! It was a box full of tempura! As a side, I expected only like 2 or 3 pieces, but when I found out it was at least 7 or 8 pieces, I was thrilled. Serving size is great for what you pay.  Sushi is fresh, nicely made, and tasty. Food was prepared well, and everything was fresh. Prices for Nichiban Sushi4U is also comparable to sushi places in the area, if anything, maybe a bit cheaper on some combos.  I would recommend this place.  Review 94 of 100"}
{"text":"I frequent this place a LOT, either to order sushi platters or for their Korean food. For awhile it was called \"Well Being Restaurant\" but now both the eat-in restaurant and take out sushi place are in one place, and called Ichicban.  The owner is a very sweet Korean lady so I love to support her business by eating here and sharing this great find with all my friends. The service used to be a bit sketchy but the last time I went, her daughter was helping out as a waitress and it made things run much better. Other times her wait staff are not the greatest so you have to be a little patient.   It's worth it though, the food is very delicious and authentic Korean! I love to order the Hae Dup Bap (sashimi and vegetables on rice), it is just amazing! I think it has 20+ ingredients including at least 3 different types of raw fish including salmon and tuna. It's just amazing! She serves a lot of different home made banchan (appetizers) and will often add on a few additional complimentary appetizers like grilled salmon head. A tip: They don't always have Kam Ja Tang, so you might want to check beforehand if that's what you have a hankering for. I've also had the Bim Bim Bap, which is also quite good.  More recently, you can order from here through Just-Eat, so if there's a deal going on, the take-out sushi platters are a great price. The don't do delivery though, so you have to pick up.   FYI, When driving here, it can be tricky turning into the building going south on Kennedy, so drive north on Kennedy to save yourself the headache. There's limited parking to so be prepared to do some jockeying if the lot is full."}
{"text":"Recently came here with my friend for lunch, really love their lunch specials. Never came here for lunch before but it was a good chance to see their lunch menu and service. We shared lunch combo b and c and it was the perfect amount of food for the both of us. Good quality food and good service."}
{"text":"Nichiban offers absolutely solid sushi at really fair prices.   I passed by this place so many times and have always wondered about it; it seemed to have decent yelp reviews so we finally decide to try it out. It's odd there aren't any decent sushi options nearby but I'm happy that Nichiban is one. It's kinda tucked and can easily be overlooked. It's easier to see the 4 U than the actual words nichiban.  We came here on a snowy Sunday evening and were one of only two tables there. It's always weird being in a somewhat empty place.   Pretty standard menu for a Japanese restaurant, really wanted to try their special rolls but instead opted for the medium party tray for the four of us. It was a really good value, 30 sashimi/20 sushi and 18 rolls for $54.99 and we all left quite satisfied. There was a great variety of sashimi that included: red snapper, salmon, salmon belly, tuna, octopus, mackerel etc. Rolls included spicy salmon, California and dynamite. All pretty standard selection. Quality was good/average, rice:fish ratio well done.   The service was good. They also gave us complimentary miso soup and salmon head (awesome) before our meal and the little fruit cup at the end. Very nice gesture!   All in all, I enjoyed nichiban and coming back is definitely not out of the question."}
{"text":"This is probably the best accidental find of me and my husband. We really were craving for the burger place beside it but the picture displays outside their restaurant intrigued us. So happy to have found this jewel. The food is soooo fresh, the service is exceptional, and the quality for money is excellent.   The first time we went here was probably 2013 and we've been going here for almost 2-3 times a month. And we've even influenced our friends to come here often as well.   My husband always orders their tempura dinner and I order their sashimi bento dinner box. Always hits the spot! The tempura is excellently fried, crisp and fresh, never oily. The salmon sashimi is very buttery and succulent. Sometimes they even give us free chapjae noodles or grilled salmon head. The servers and the owners already know is there and never fail to make us feel like family when we dine there. They know how to take our orders correctly even if we make several replacements or modifications.   Since this is a small family owned resto, be patient. They deliver with quality. But since the resto can only seat so much, you can opt for take out if there are no seats available.   This will always be our \"go to\" for our Japanese craving. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here after walking around Pacific mall, and that 5 minute walk across the street was well worth it! Despite it being advertised as a takeout shop, there's a place to sit comfortably  888 Special combo (~$23) for 8 pcs of sashimi 8pcs sushi, 8pcs roll of your choice Good variety of sushi, tastes fresh, beautiful presentation. Ordered the white tuna roll (last oneon the page) and it was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth fantastic It's a really good deal  I would come back here again for another sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place for sushi near the pmall area. Prices are very fair, sashimi is fresh and portions for sushi and non-sushi are good. I ordered their dinner special which comes with sashimi, sushi and a special roll. I was able to choose a torch white tuna roll as my special roll, and it was very tasty.  I also ordered their chicken Budaki with cheese and it was also very delicious and generous. It tasted similar to Korean restaurants that offer. Service is very good and friendly. Place seems like it's owned by Korean/Japanese people. They make their plates decorative so it really gives an elegant sushi dining without breaking the bank. Place doesn't seat a lot of people. Interior seems well kept and clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I loved this place much more with the previous owner because of the service and portion to price ratio however since they've changed owners it hasn't been the same. Still one of my go to sushi places because the food is good and the atmosphere is generally more modern but the service and portions have gone down. Their sushi combos/specials are not bad. The salmon bento is always consistent"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to sushi places, it's a little small but the food was delicious and the service is great. Their food quality however did fluctuate and while they're still good, they were better before. It could be due to a change of owners but so far it's pretty good so I will continue going here. Also parking in this tiny plaza can be very tight, be prepared to have to squeeze pass cars if it's busy."}
{"text":"Very cute place for a date or your casual dine in. My girlfriend and i ordered a kalbi bento and a bulgogi bento both cooked very well. We also got takoyaki and gyoza which was also very tasty. My favourite was the uni sushi very fresh and quite a treat. I recommend you come here and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I believe they changed their name as the giant sign outside says \"sushi 4 u\" but I'm not too sure. When I first saw this place, I was reluctant to go in. It's pretty small and hidden behind a fast food restaurant, easily unnoticed. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the food and had to go back.  On this visit, I had a sushi pizza and a beef bento box. The sushi pizza is so delicious and it was gone within minutes. The beef and the rice were amazing together as well and the sushi that came with the bento was good too. The bento might look small but it's actually really filling, my friends and I all had to get take-out boxes. I've come here a few times and I'm definitely going back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a Korean-run sushi restaurant, and it is one of the better places to get sushi if you're near Pacific mall.  I usually get takeout platters. The sushi is always fresh and tastes pretty good. No complaints. It's not terrible, but it's not the best either. The price is pretty standard.  I just wish they were open on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I came for dinner order. Rennovated frome the last time I came here. We ordered 3 special rolls. Spider roll, volcano roll and snow roll. Quite tasty. Prices for special rolls are comparable to other sushi joints in markham.   Service was ok. Food came out at a respectible time.   The restaurant ambiance was quiet. Not a lot of customers come to eat dinner here. Not sure why. But it is an average sushi joint in the markham area without driving all the way to highway 7."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi and sashimi at reasonable price for takeout. Wasabi, soya sauce, chopsticks provided."}
{"text":"I've been here once before but I don't remember how it was.  I came in early for a table of 6 and was really hungry after a long bike ride. I ordered an avocado salmon roll to tide me over until my guests arrived. I was really really hungry so anything you put in front of me would be really tasty but the salmon was very chewy and stringy. We got up and paid for the roll and left.   Now I know why this place is so forgetful.  Also, actually finding the place is a chore in the midst of the awfully designed drive way and \"fantastic\" drivers in the area, good luck getting there.   My girlfriend may have made me a sushi snob by taking me to higher end sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy their California rolls , minimum rice great ingredients!  You can fell the chief care about their customers   Good value bento set!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a new owner. This used to be one of my favourite sushi locations that is not AYCE and now I have to find a new one.  I can tell that they have a new owner because they have a complete change over of staff except for the male server. They also got new menus printed. It looks like the items on the menu stayed the same  I always order a party tray on Sundays, and I can say that the quality of the sushi and sashimi has changed. The sashimi wasn't as fresh. The slices of sashimi were a lot thinner than before. The sushi and rolls were rolled in a sloppy manner and the rice was under seasoned. I usually order the Medium Sushi and Sashimi Party Tray and the family and friends always finish the tray, but a lot of them even said that it tastes different now.  My previous experiences dining in and ordering take out were amazing, and I am sad to say that I won't be visiting this restaurant as often anymore. I'll probably give it another try in a month or two."}
{"text":"May 4, 2018 - it is very hard to get parking here since there is only about 15-20 spots maybe less. I didn't count. But we parked just a few buildings down and walked over.   When we got in it was a bit of a wait to get a seat. The restaurant is small and cute. After about 30mins or so we got seated. We ordered the small party tray (43 pieces), Octopus Balls and ribs.   We ate everything and we were so full, everything was yummy. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I came yesterday, a Sunday. Usually small eating places are closed on Sunday, but these guys aren't. When I walked in I was greeted by the chef there and asked if I wanted take-out. I said yes, and I ordered what I wanted. One of the guys working there gave me a hot cup of green tea while I was waiting for my roll to be made. That was really nice of them! Then I got my roll. I got the \"Crazy Roll\" (deep-fried California Roll with a special sauce). It was very nice. It doesn't stop there. The roll also came with salad and miso soup! Bonus! At some sushi take-out shops, they charge you extra for that. It's complimentary here. The menu has a great variety. It has special rolls, Korean options, party trays and bento boxes, just to name a few. If you're in the Scarborough/Pacific Mall area and have a craving for good sushi, go here! :)"}
{"text":"Really good fresh fish. The texture was soft and buttery, and the thickness was just the right size too (for both the sashimi cut and the sushi cut). The fish layered on top of the rice for the sushi was not too thick or too thin, and you can eat the whole piece in one bite, like you're supposed to with sushi. The amount of wasabi between the fish and the rice was also perfect, and I only needed to add a touch of soy sauce. Our server was also friendly and answered all our questions.  The place is a little small. We came on a week day, and so we pretty had the place to ourselves, but I wonder if it might be more busy during the weekends."}
{"text":"I agree with all the previous reviewers that Nichiban serves excellent take out sushi/sashimi party plates.  I have been a customer of Nichiban since the month it opened.  It was run by an older Korean couple then.  Years past, the husband stopped coming in due to health issues.  The middle aged Korean couple who run the store now are new management.  I am glad that they have left the take out menu basically unchanged.  The dine in menu has changed for the better.  The food also has better plating.  The lunch menu has good deals!    I am glad for the change.  Nichiban is no longer just an excellent sushi and sashimi take out joint, but is also a good dine in joint."}
{"text":"The sushi quality has definitely gotten better since I last came here. I've been there twice in the past 2 months and have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Portions here are ridiculous. It's great.   We ordered takoyaki ($6) and a Triple Combo A ($15?). I thought 6 pieces of takoyaki was slightly pricey. But when the platter came I understood why. These things were massive - golf ball sized if not bigger. It wasn't even all dough - there were two pieces of decent-sized octopus in each.   The Triple Combo A was 8 California rolls, 8 pieces of sushi, and 4 pieces of assorted sashimi. I could barely finish the fish. It was a struggle but a delicious one. The pieces of sashimi are so thick - I actually prefer thinner slices, so next time I might be inclined to get less. The various fish on the sushi was delicious - included mackerel, salmon, red snapper, tuna, white tuna, shrimp, and possibly yellowtail? not sure.  The presentation of food here is amazing. The wait was a little longer than usual but the presentation is worth it. While we waited we kept staring at other people's food, especially those who ordered platters (like that 120 piece platter - super intense).  So worth it. We also got a salmon teriyaki bento which also came with California rolls. We couldn't finish any of them and so we took home lunch (so 14 huge California rolls in total).  Will probably be my go to for sushi from now on."}
{"text":"I have never been to Nichiban before but they are under new owners from about a month ago according to the waitress. It seems like a Korean family run restaurant. There is a good amount of seating for dine-in but parking is very limited and cramp.   Everything from beginning to end was top notch for me. Its the little things that this place does right that made me give it the 5 star. Hell, even the tea tasted better to me here.  Kalbi lunch bento box $10.99 - For this price I really wasn't expecting much but man was I blown away by the quality and value. - 6 piece sushi (very large and filling. Fresh avocado and processed crab meat) - deep fried seasoned potato (inside is soft and almost like mash potato. Tasted amazing with  a nice crispy outer layer. I would order this alone if it was available on the menu) - the kalbi was soft and tender and the cuts of meat were pretty decent and good portion - meal also came with salad, miso soup, rice and steamed veggies  Tempura lunch bento box $8.99 - You get all the same things mentioned above except the steam veggies and kalbi of course. The tempura was deep fried well and tasted great.   Usually I am not full enough after eating one bento box so added the dragon roll but in this case I was already full after eating the bento box.   Black dragon roll $13.99 - nice big chunks of BBQ eel. Beautiful presentation. Tasted great. Huge and very filling.  Overall, the food was excellent. If you compare to other Japanese restaurants I feel this place is doing it a step above better and doing it for a lower price.  Service was excellent as it was not very busy for a Wednesday afternoon. I am very impressed from beginning to end.   Can't wait to come back and try their sashimi."}
{"text":"Ordered the medium sashimi sushi and roll platter here during Christmas and we loved it. It was a welcome addition to our holiday dinner. The fish tasted fresh and the rolls were tasty. They also made sure to pack lots of wasabi, soy sauce, and ginger for us. Platter was $65 which is about average for this size platter. Service was prompt and order was ready when we went to pickup."}
{"text":"Another great hidden gem. In north scarborough across from Pacific Mall. Very busy area, small venue with limited parking, bursting with great customer service. Sushi is a good-size, great tasting and one of my go-to's. Regularly order red dragon, green dragon, and avocado pizza."}
{"text":"This is definitely the sushi place I go to. Dinner for one? No problem, order take out if you craving for sushi. Their sashimi and sushi is very fresh and the price are decent. Their spicy salmon roll is my favourite. I normally order chefs sashimi or salmon lover for take out.. I like to order take out and have a bottle of sake at home. Of course you can dine in but try to go a little bit early because not a lot of parking spots there. sometimes I have to park beside petro and walk over. We ordered the fire attack last time at the restaurant, they set the sushi on fire  (hee hee). They accept credit card or cash. Wanna go back again and again and again"}
{"text":"Totally average sushi. I guess in this neighbourhood, it's an okay choice.   Ordered the Sushi A Lunch (~$13) to go - 8 pieces of nigiri and 6 pieces of California roll. The California rolls was good, rice wasn't too thick and the veggies were fresh. On the other hand, some of the the fish for the nigiri weren't the greatest. The seared one and the beige one (not tilapia) were quite fishy and didn't taste very fresh. Thickness of the fish was good, good proportion to the amount of rice. Lunch deal comes with soup and salad too. The salad was pretty bad though, the lettuce was all browning and probably looked like it was frozen.   Probably won't come back as there's nothing worth a return for."}
{"text":"Very good but intimate place for Japanese food run by Korean! Sushi wasn't all rice. Bento box was filling. Definitely would go back and recommend. Remember to park at Dragon Center or Pacific mall because the parking lot has limited space.  Excellent service, they even offered free ginger and wasabi for our leftover California roll. No lame orange desert."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the area that still cares about customer service. The staff are friendly and are happy to fullfill your requests best they can. Sure there are cheaper places out there but the satisfaction of their service more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner twice. They serve decent sushi and rolls for the price (5/5), but mediocre cooked food (2.5 or 3/5). We ordered the fire attack roll both times and really enjoyed it. As the name suggests, the roll is served lit on fire. So its warm when you eat it. Sashimi and sushi seems fresh and decent quality. As for cooked food, I ordered the beef udon and it wasn't that good...not much beef, udon is over cooked, and the flavour is just not really there. I am hoping their other cooked food tastes better. Overall based on my experience I would stick to the sushi, sashimi and rolls at this restaurant if you want a solid 4 stars experience."}
{"text":"It is a Korean operated Japanese sushi bar. You can listening K-pop music, enjoying Japanese sushi and Canadian seafood in here. Interesting.  The sushi is awesome and authentic, nothing to complain.  We are lucky, they offering oyster dinner special. It is seasonal dishes with buy one get one free deal. The oyster is big and fresh. 6 oyster for each people is pretty enough.  The waiters are well trained. They always looking for people who need help.  5 stars, I will come again."}
{"text":"*A little lower than a 4 star because of their slow service.*  First time coming here today and I was pleasantly surprised by the nice interior compared to what you'd expect from the outside.  As a group of 4, we each ordered one of our own meals and shared 2 other plates (Fire Attack and Chef's Sashimi). I ordered the Don Donburi ($18.00).  Don Donburi: The fish was nice and fresh! If you like something along the lines of poké bowls, I think you'd enjoy this dish. It doesn't come with sauce like most pokés do, but I like to dip my spoon in soy sauce before taking a spoonful of the donburi, which is enough flavour for me.  Fire Attack: \"Wow.\" I didn't expect there to be so much... stuff. It's got so many toppings and sauces and although I did enjoy it, it was too heavy for me. If you want to get this, share with friends! Definitely over-the-top with the fire and all the ingredients in it, but not exactly a bad thing.  Chef's Sashimi: Like in the Don Donburi, the sashimi was fresh! Aside from that, there wasn't really anything special about it, but it was good.  An hour into dinner service, we had only been served salad. Even though I saw only a few people making sushi, I was a little disappointed by how slow it took for our orders. The table of 2 next to us came and ordered after our table, but their dishes came before us and they even left a while before we had finished half our food. However, I could see the people making sushi put a lot of care and focus into making the food as well as plating it. I admire how they work so diligently.  Aside from the slow service, the staff was very nice and checked up on us once in a while. Hopefully next time, the food won't take so long. I will return!"}
{"text":"Had early dinner and decided to try out this place. Owner are japanese and the place looks authentic. Very please with what we ordered. Quality is superb! Will surely visit this place again"}
{"text":"So this is a true hidden gem.   Hidden behind gas station and Big Moe's.   It's a really good spot that serves fresh sushi and sashimi and if you eat in restaurant, then you will notice they put a lot of care and love into the presentation and taste.  I always get the Sashimi Bento Box for takeout and it comes to around $16 everytime with taxes :)  Tbh, fair prices and very convenient for me, so def worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants, the food is great, it has a good ambience and cute decor, the service is good. This place is a go to for my boyfriend and I. I usually go for a bento box because I like a variety. I've tried the kalbi, bulgogi and salmon teriyaki bentos which are pretty good. Their sushi is great and always fresh."}
{"text":"Really good place for sushi! Their sushi on fire is definitely something I'd order again! Would go back"}
{"text":"I needed to order a sushi platter for fathers day.  I wanted to try Seoul Banchan, but their phone was always busy, so i looked up some more yelp reviews, and came across this place.  I've been here before... years ago, it was under another name.  Anyhow, looked at their menu and decided to get the small party tray - 45pcs for $37.99  Very nice over the phone, and upon pick up as well.  Strange thing is she asked me how i'm paying, i said \"cash\".  I'm wondering if i pay by visa, will they charge me an extra 2%??  Sushi rolls were good! Sushi was good, sashimi was good !!  All good !!  Total was $42.95 with taxes.  They gave ample amounts of wasabi, and soy sauce and ginger, and chopsticks, napkins. Enough for 3 people.  Parking is a bit tight, there are only a few spots in the back.  If you are picking up during rush hour, then it could be tough making a left out of the driveway.  We are talking about Kennedy North bound traffic.  3.5 stars for this experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Average sushi for an a la carte place. They forgot my salad with my dinner but were very apologetic and brought it out. They also give a grilled salmon head on the house to virtually every table. A good use of salmon heads that would probably otherwise be thrown out!  The sushi was ok. The rolls were neatly made but had what I thought was too much cucumber. The fish was fresh. Note that wasabi is placed under the fish in the sushi."}
{"text":"Note:  If at all possible, avoid this parking lot.  It is very busy and narrow and you may have problems exiting if there aren't any spots!  If you're at Pac Mall and want to check this place out, it's easier to just walk across the street.  Very solid sushi option, especially for lunch, right across the street from Pac Mall, directly behind Petro Canada in the same plaza as Fat Ninja Bites.  Again, lot is precarious, basically a one-way, in or out, so either sharpen those stunt driving skills &/or I hope you have a back-up camera in place!  Restaurant is fairly small, around 6 tables (for 2-4ppl) and the sushi bar.  Restaurant filled up quickly and there were quite a few people who came in for takeout.  Our table ordered a variety of maki rolls and nigiri, a la carte and in bento boxes.  Pieces were large, fish was fresh, and there was a good variety of fish used in the sushi.  Definitely not a fancy place, better for lunch just due to pricing, area, & atmosphere.  Solid sushi option that's away from the depressing food court across the street!"}
{"text":"Review is only for take out.  I have ordered take out from Nichiban probably a dozen times. I have tried many sushi take out restaurants in Markham but this has always been the one that stands out the most in terms of quality and quantity.   The store is tucked right behind the gas station across from pmall. Unless you visit during non prime meal times, I suggest parking at pmall and some other lot. I usually come before 11:30 or after 2 for lunch, and before 6pm for dinner.   I have gotten Sashimi, bento boxes, and rolls from them, and their rolls are what keeps me going back for more. They are very generous with the amount of fish they include in the rolls. The avocados have always been ripe, never hard, never brown. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna they use are actually spicy. They don't load the rolls with a ton of rice either.  I always call 20 minutes ahead, and my order is always ready for pick up when I arrive.  If you are not a huge fan of raw fish, the beef gyoza is decent too."}
{"text":"First time I found out about this place was from my friend's instagram picture of their sushi. I felt I should take a chance to see how it is, since I live fairly close to it...   I immediately love their sushi. I find their coworkers very friendly and their quality of the sushi has appealed to my taste. I really like their presentation for their sushi and I feel the price is worth it for their cost. I really like their lunch special prices too! I went here twice so far and I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Their sashimi is always fresh, owners always friendly. This place is truly one of Toronto's best kept secret. This place is built more for pickup than eat in, as there are only 7 tables. This place can survive because almost all of its businesses are from takeout. Keep in mind also that there is limited parking available (about 15 spots). Worth mentioning, their rolls are full of good balance taste as well as creativity. Their soft-shell crab app is fairly good."}
{"text":"Markham is a far drive for us so when we go, we like to make it well worth it by going to the best food places! We searched on Yelp for the highest rated sushi joint in our area and Nichiban showed up. Sadly, it didn't live up to expectations.  We ordered the Hawaiian Volcano roll, salmon and avocado roll and a dinner combo that consisted of a spicy salmon roll (6 pieces), 8 assorted sashimi and 8 assorted sushi. The rolls were not bad but really nothing special. Maybe since management changed the quality has changed too?  Otherwise, the service was great, presentation is awesome (see photos) and prices were average."}
{"text":"Good prices and pretty good taste. Lunch specials are filling. Would prefer better description on their menu for their bento box options."}
{"text":"The ginger and wasabi are pretty fresh and delish, service is friendly and helpful. Sashimi is decent sushi is average. They are Koreans overall experience is alright."}
{"text":"Situated at one of the busiest intersection, Kennedy and Steeles, this Korean/Japanese restaurant is tucked inside a small plaza behind the gas station. I don't come as often as I would like because parking here (a narrow lot with one way in/out onto Kennedy) drives me nuts but of the few times I've been here, food has been tasty and consistent. Service has been friendly every time too!   Their rolls are larger than the typical rolls at Scarborough sushi locations and my favorites here are Kennedy roll and Mountain roll. In my most recent visit with a friend, we shared the takoyaki balls and salmon lovers set. The 6 takoyaki balls were nicely laid out on a bamboo leaf and served very hot with a large piece of octopus inside. As for the salmon lovers set, sashimi was very fresh and filling. Perfect for sharing! The presentation of their food such as this lovers set was beautiful (although the artificial aquarium plant sitting next to the sashimi did repulse me a bit..).   Good presentation starts with good preparation. When I see that the chef has prepped the dish with great effort, I'm tasting not only the flavors but his/her dedication toward their job/skill/passion what have you. Kudos to these chefs who remain passionate about sushi making!   Overall reasons why I think Nichiban Sushi4u deserves 4 stars:  -taste/quality has been consistent and delicious  -food presentation is just as essential as the taste and this place has proven to me that they take pride and time in creating their dishes to make them look attractive and appetizing"}
{"text":"Nichiban Sushi is one of my favourite sushi take out places in town. Been ordering platters from them for as long as I can remember. Occasionally, I would try new sushi take out places here and there, but were turned off by the mushy, freezer brunt sashimi, and \"bad-rice\"... Nichiban still keeps me coming back for more. I can always count on them for the quality sashimi and sushi. Highly recommended :) #worthyourmoney  This place has been here for decades, and it was originally called Ichiban Sushi. It started off as a tiny take out sushi store / fish market, and then turned into a tiny restaurant - offering not only quality sashimi and sushi, but also authentic Korean food (yummy pork bone soup!).  Pre-ordered a Medium Party Tray for $55 a few days ago, and picked it up this evening. It includes an assortment of sashimi, nigiri sushi and maki rolls. Comes with soy sauce, wasabi, sweetened ginger and chopsticks - all packed up and ready to go when I arrive at said time. I'm also very pleased with the friendly service... the sweet lady (possibly owner?) always puts a smile on my face :)  Coming back soon for my next party needs!  P.S. It can be a bit tricky getting to this restaurant. Head north on Kennedy Road towards Steeles Avenue, turn right right before Petro Canada to save you some trouble :) More parking spaces behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great quality of food!! The plates looked very clean and appetizing. The fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which I'm kind of particular about. Very nice service as well.  Parking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours.  Definitely would like to try take-out next time."}
{"text":"We tried this place from a good friend's recommendation and we loved it ! Been coming here ever since . if you want quality sashimi cuts this is the place to be. its a small place tucked at the back of a gas station (sitting to a now trending now also my fave korean katsu place). Hidden gems you would say. their special and signature rolls are not only tasty but equally filling. Serving is larger than your average Japanese restaurant (not kidding) I can only fit one roll in my mouth and that's stretching it.  prices aren't cheap but with the quality of food & ingredients its worth well it.definitely good bang for your buck! We came here tonight the place is already half filled with a number of take out party trays on the counter. People were just streaming in and out. quiet and cozy just the way we like it.  we always ended up getting their  888 Special combo ..why ? because for $23 we get 8 slices of sashimi, 8pcs sushi & a special roll of your choice also 8pcs (we chose Las Vegas roll tonight) ; we also tried their Crispy dynamite roll (two thumbs up emoticon here); takoyaki balls (one of the good ones in town that we've tried so far) . I'm excited for our next return to try other dishes theres a hot bbq chicken with cheese on top that I have my eyes on ...."}
{"text":"Wanna try this place long ago after reading the reviews.  Finally has a chance to try it with my friend and hubby.  Although it's a small restaurant but I feel it's quite cozy.  We ordered 888 combo with black dragon roll, chicken teriyaki & Sugar Mama Roll.  Overall I think all the sushi and sashimi r fresh and taste good.  The chicken teriyaki taste a bit bland, other than that I like this place.  Also price is quite reasonable too.  The only cons is limited parking as it is situated in a street mall.  But I will come more often when I crave for sushi."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Nichiban tonight.  We got there at the right time and managed to get seating, luckily, without any wait. The seating really is limited!  Anyone who showed up after us, was out of luck!   I ordered the small sashimi party tray - 30 pieces for $30. My hubby and I really enjoyed it - it was super fresh!   I also ordered the Tonkatsu ramen for $10 and my hubby ordered the Korean ramen ($10) with chicken ($2 extra).  While I liked the ramen, I felt it was average. My hubby's ramen ended up being too spicy for him.   Service was very polite and courteous but on the slow side. We also had to ask for our tea to be refilled a number of times, although in fairness, there was a large party there at the same time as us, and only one waitress.   There was a steady stream of take out orders while we were there - maybe this is the way to go next time. I will definitely return in the future - either for take out or dine in."}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi platter for $35 and it was really good! 3 people to share and we still couldn't finish it. Side order of spicy salmon roll $5 which was alright. The rolls are very big. Not those dinky ones you get at supermarkets or buffets.   The food also came with miso soup and salad. Yay!  The staff was so sweet and attentive. Very nice atmosphere. Platters are definitely the way to go! They do take out as well."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, both times were to pick up our sushi platter - the staff is super friendly and the food is great tasting.  If you're getting long wait times to order a platter during a holiday (like thanksgiving or a long weekend), this place can always seem to get your phone order filled within the hour."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years. Although it has gone through a few new owners, I'm glad to see it grow to the restaurant/ takeout place it is now. I usually order a small sushi/sashimi party tray from them for family gatherings, but decided to eat in one day to get a different experience. I was by myself and ordered their sushi/sashimi bento box dinner and have been raving this meal since. The portion was huge and you get a variety of sashimi, not just the typical 3 types of fish in other sashimi bentos. I wish I took a picture, maybe I'll update this review later. In addition to the variety of fish is the variety of items.. You get sashimi, the house roll, salad, miso soup, and a variety of vegetable and shrimp tempura. With tax and tip less than $20. I went back with the rest of my family and they all agreed that the sushi quality was better than most places.. And to get my mother to say that means a lot. Lol"}
{"text":"great place to pick up fresh sushi"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner with my bf went well considering we were just driving by, and found a sushi place we never tried before.   The presentation is amazing.  The maki rolls are huge, but they tend to fall apart. The only thing i would change about the dinner special 888 is that it should be more specific that it's all assorted, mind us thinking that we get to choose one specific type of fish which is extra of charge but not bad.   It's a little bit on the pricey side, but i would definitely try this again. The sushi pizza was good, but the only problem was that it lacked in toppings as the rice cake was a lot larger than the piece of topping. For 8.99, it's kind of pricey.  I looked at other items on the menu that i would usually get (unagi don) and that too was overly priced.   Overall my experience here went pretty smooth..."}
{"text":"My group came here after finishing some escape rooms famished. We immediately ordered a large sushi platter, with two signature rolls--- the fire attack and gold star rolls. In short, excellent value, delicious, fresh, and well-made sushi. The platter had a decent variety ranging from your salmon nigiri to rainbow rolls and futo maki. The Fire Attack roll arrived at our table aflame and was an enjoyable bite of smokey, savoury, sweet, and crunchy all in one.  That night, they also served tables grilled cod cheek? I believe, which was also a welcome addition. After everything was said and done, bill came just under what we'd normally spend at an AYCE, but I'd say the quality well above the average AYCE. For that, this place comes recommended."}
{"text":"First time here and got a large sushi and sashimi take out platter. Was a bit worried after one person gave them a horrible review for a Sunday takeout but pulled the trigger anyways and was quite impressed. Maybe they had a bad day that time.   Sashimi was quite fresh but wish they had more variety such as white tuna and hamachi.  They even gave a complimentary grilled salmon head."}
{"text":"Nichiban Sushi Takeout Platter did go downhill lately.  The fish selection is repetitive and you get the same selection for both sashimi and sushi in the same platter. The sashimi was usually cut without care and some pieces were still stuck together and some looked like odds and ends.  Without the 10% cash pick up discount it is no longer as good as before with the decline in quality.  Maybe eating in now is a better option?"}
{"text":"From the outside, you will probably have no idea where this place is. If you're really smart like me, you will pull into the garage next door instead of the sushi place, and then have to perform an elaborate double right turn in a super busy intersection.   But. Once you get into this place, you will see a cute sushi joint, with attentive service and nice decor. And the sushi is simply fantastic. Lunch specials are affordable and offer lots of variety. Their sashimi and nigiri are so fresh and expertly assembled. The maki were a bit too large (takes two bites instead of one) but still delicious.  When I went on a weekday at 3 pm, the place was ours and ours alone. A couple people came in for pick-up orders but that was it. So I didn't exactly see it during peak hours, but I can imagine it would fill up verrry quickly, as the place is tiny and has limited parking. But totally worth a fight, or at least a promise to visit during a quieter time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years (and even worked here as a waitress before!). they've changed many owners in the past and they've become less generous with their servings lately :( but I can always expect very fresh sashimi from them and usually order from them only in my area. Their sushis are a very good portion as the fish seems to be always bigger than the rice balls.  The menu never really changes but you can expect the usual platters/boats/appetizers from any typical Japanese restaurant. I usually always get the small party tray and it's enough to feed three of us. If you're lucky they'll give you really fatty salmon pieces and I even got Uni one time on the house from the owner.  They give out free soup and salad and sometimes small Korean dishes, but only for dine in. They are also known to sometimes give out salmon heads for free too. Seating is a bit limited but it's usually empty. A lot of people come here for takeout instead."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5/5 stars.  Seating is quite minimal, around 25 people seating.  Their bento box portions are quite big and very reasonably priced.  We got their Medium combo and opted to change all the fish to salmon sashimi, sushi, and also asked to change 10'pieces of the salmon sashimi to salmon belly sashimi for 8$ more in total.  The sushi was fresh, and the salmon belly was fatty. Our favorite was the spicy salmon roll.. they have one of the best spicy salmon rolls I've tasted.  We also got the t n t roll. It was good but too saucy."}
{"text":"Tiny place you would never find unless you are looking for it. Read good reviews of it on a blog and dragged my husband here. Made the journey across the city and happy we did. Everything was delicious and fresh. I am a vegetarian but they had plenty of options. I had a vegetarian bento box and a avacado crunch roll. I assumed the crunch roll would be  a small maki roll, for $5.99, but instead out came a huge 8 piece beautiful roll. Most of my bento box came home with me and made for an excellent next day meal."}
{"text":"Lot's of shady sushi places around Scarborough/Markham, but this one is unlike all the others.  Sashimi tasted fresh, great size rolls (other places make them monstrous size, you can't even eat it properly -- or they skimp out on all the good ingredients).   I ordered the sashimi bento and a spicy tuna hand roll. Filled me right up and I left extremely happy -- will definitely be back! Everything was 5 Stars delicious!  Restaurant is also very clean."}
{"text":"I don't care if it's Korean run restaurant. . This is by far my favourite sushi spot around this area.  Good Food is good food.   You can't go wrong with the mountain roll with either the chef special or the sushi party tray for 2 ppl.  I'm glad they serve beer now.  My experience wouldn't be complete without my cold Sapporo.   Been here 3 times.  The first was with the old ownership and then the last 2 with the new.  And it's change drastically for the better since the new owners took over."}
