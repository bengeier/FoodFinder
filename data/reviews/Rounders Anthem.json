{"text":"decent food, good service, much better than Olivos"}
{"text":"great food! can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The filet & the mahi mahi are so good you'll want to lick the plate. In the bar Laura, Brad & Ryan are the best around. If you've tried the food b4, come again because they've kicked it up a notch or two! And the clientele is so fun!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday at Rounder's the lunch special was 'Chicken Cashew Sandwich on Wheat Bread with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle', along with choice of side.  It sounded great, so all four of us ordered the lunch special (my husband and I split the sandwich) with onion rings.  The waitress asked me if I would like ranch dressing for the onion rings and I said, \"yes, please\".

Well...the sandwiches arrive and they're all on WHITE bread with one leaf of lettuce on the side, one pickle and the onion rings (onion rings were extra money, which the waitress neglected to tell us), but NO TOMATO and NO ONION.  The WHITE bread was so flimsy that it could hardly maintain the meager 'Chicken Cashew' filling and I only had ONE, that's right-ONE half of a cashew in my half of the sandwich (hubby said he had the other half of cashew-lol).  And, I never did see that ranch dressing that the waitress offered me, which I really could have used on this dry, bland sandwich.

The four of us who went to lunch live in Anthem and love having a local restaurant that is golf cart accessible.  Having said that, unless the folks at Rounder's get it together, their restaurant is not going to make it."}
{"text":"With more than one IPA on tap and an unexpected menu that's better than your average pub food, we are so glad to have this place in our neighborhood!  We just wished they had Green Flash West Coast IPA on tap again. Here's a picture of the carpaccio!"}
{"text":"Their booths are made for super skinny people. Good luck if you're just over 170lbs. Oh and you have to ask for extra sauce on practically everything u order. The quality and price for the food is excellelent. No matter how great the food is u want sauce with it. Super dry without it."}
{"text":"Gamblers beware. Machine payouts and gambler system rewards well below average. Only positive is food and rapidly improving decor, but if you gamble in anthem stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome! Except the Manager that glares at children for laughing. TURD!"}
{"text":"Good service very friendly staff. Food is actually pretty good. Unfortunately it is very smokey in the bar and it does get a little smokey in the restaraunt area as well. I would go back more often if it was smoke free. They have a bartender that needs to learn how to make an Old Fasioned."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the most uncomfortable experience I've had in a very long time. My wife and I arrived on election night to have dinner at the bar (not the dining room), and were immediately greeted by the regular female bartender and told we would need to move from our seats soon because she had regular \"players who eat dinner here coming in soon and they like those machines\". No biggie, we'll slide over two stools, I completely understand. Over we go.

I ordered my beer, we ordered our food, and I asked to have the channel changed to a specific news network to watch the election coverage. Shortly after getting my first beer, the news channel suddenly changed to the local news. No big deal, I'll keep my mouth shut until the moment is right, then I'll bring it to her attention and ask to have it switched back. Meanwhile the \"regular players\" arrive and sit at the two machines next to us. \"Hi! How ya doin?\"

I guess the two \"regular players\" didn't have enough space between us and them and couldn't say it to us... we must be living in a very passive aggressive society; before I know it the female bartender comes around the bar and tells me she's going to \"slide you over a little bit. It's ok, I'm big and strong.\" Before I can tell her I'd be happy to move myself, she's sliding my chair WITH ME STILL IN IT, AND A MOUTH FULL OF FRIES!!!!

I keep my composure and pay attention as this female bartender now coos over these two \"regular players\". It was blatantly obvious that she cared tremendously about their patronage and couldn't care less about ours. I understand, she makes her living off their gaming tips and we only tip on food and beer. Again, I keep my composure, and my mouth shut.

Eventually, the moment is right and I ask to have the channel returned to the news I had been watching earlier. She then proceeds to tell me that her boss changed the channel. OK, I'll speak with him when he comes around. He makes his way around the bar and asks if we need anything. I told him that we had been watching news \"channel A\", and that it had been changed to the local news. I then asked to have the channel changed back to \"news channel A\". He walked away and returned a few minutes later, before he changed the channel to news \"channel B\". I did NOT want news \"channel B\". I specifically asked for \"channel A\".

When I brought the discrepancy about the channels to his attention, he then tried to lie to me by saying, \"we don't get that channel\". I informed him that we had JUST been watching it and that HIS bartender had changed it for us, at which time he changed is reason to, \"we can't put it on that tv.\" I then told him that we had literally JUST been watching it on \"that tv\", at which point he said, \"we only have three boxes (cable boxes I presumed) and we can't do that.\" 

My aggravation was now beginning to spike. I told him, very politely, that it didn't seem to be an issue when we asked to have it changed. His response was one of the worst representations of customer service I had heard in a very long time; \"it's all the same anyway.\" Umm... actually, it's not. I just wanted to sit at this bar with my wife, watch the news, drink a beer, and eat a burger.

Needless to say, we ate, paid and left shortly thereafter. This is not the first time we have had far less than stellar service from this place. I am a very principled person, and I will walk away from things and never look back if I feel like they do not deserve my business. I wanted to give this place (the third business to occupy the building) my patronage. After this experience, I will NEVER return. In the future, we will be spending our time and money at PT's Pub on bicentennial... old faithful, been here since the beginning."}
{"text":"Used to be a very friendly place. I have spent several hundreds of dollars on food, drinks and gambling only to be told I don't gamble enough for a comp draft beer, what does a draft beer cost a bar now maby .50 cents minus  the IRS right off. So sad another nice neighbor bar bites the dust.  Thanks to social media alot of friends and family won't be patronizing Rounders anymore plus I live in a tight knit 55 plus community and am always being ask by newcomers where is a good place to eat or drink. WELL Rounders is no longer mentioned except to say don't go there. Plenty of other nice friendly taverns I'm the area. Rounders can kiss my comp *#×!!%."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful experience at Rounders. The beers were ice cold and the food was awesome. Service was a bit slow, but definitely to be expected during grand opening timeframe. I highly recommend their Famous Chicken Wings marinated in garlic. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect service. Wonderful people.  Management is on point. Must have the Ahi Crisps, Ahi Salad, and Fish n' Chips. Oh and can't complain about the selection of beers."}
{"text":"My neighborhood bar and grill. Fortunately, the food is actually really good and the service is great 99% of the time. 

My family and I come to Rounders at least once a week because it's close to home. We have never had a bad meal here. The chicken wings are cooked perfectly, awesome burgers, fish and chips, and definitely one of the better Caesar salads in town. One of my favorite sandwiches is their pastrami. It is served on rye and it's a pretty big portion. 

Rounders has a separate bar area which seems to always be busy (a good sign!) and the dining room is nice. 

The server who usually works the lunch shift on weekdays is always on top of it - especially for being by herself (at least it appears to be that way) and the evening crew has gotten much better! 

Overall, Rounders is a great place to grab some good food either with the family, a date, or solo!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and service was awesome both Megan and Crystal were very nice and attentive! We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, because there are great vibes, great staff, great food, and descent winnings. Some of the biggest winnings I've ever had came out of this place. Plus I come here to hang out with friends and some of the other regulars. But it's not a bad place if you're a first timer. After you've been here enough you'll start learning everyone's names. The chicken wings and nachos are my absolute favorites. I could eat some now if I could. There is never a wait for a table and it's a great family oriented dining area with a party going on in the bar."}
{"text":"Poor service. No one to greet us when entering, wandered around for a few minutes, then finally seated.  We waited several minutes after we decided what to order for our waiter to finally come over. At this point we had already decided to leave and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Under construction. Bartenders are great. Food very good when available. Would love to see more promotions for gamblers. Drinks are stiff and portions are great!"}
{"text":"been here 5-6 times, always sat in the bar. service is fast and friendly, shout out to the bartenders, your great.

food is great, nothing to complain about. spinach artichoke dip is awesome!"}
{"text":"Looking for a local place to have lunch with a buddy on Memorial Day. We heard good things about Rounders and felt we should give it a try. When we walked in around 12:15, the place was literally empty. Not something you want to see in a restaurant. Just makes it feel like a bad vibe. The good news, when we left about an hour later, the place was three-quarters packed. Much better vibe.
The Tommy Burger sounded great. Only problem is I'm not a big fan of chopped meat. Not a problem. Our server told me they make their own ground turkey patties and substituting it would be without a charge. The Tommy burger had two big strips of bacon, melted cheddar cheese, and a lot of grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. Also a healthy portion of lettuce and tomato. All of this on a pretzel bun. Very filling and very yummy. It comes with the side of french fries. No charge to upgrade to sweet potato fries. Another major Plus. All in all, an excellent choice for local lunch. Plus there was a buy one get one free coupon. What could be better??? I definitely will return."}
{"text":"The food is good one time but not the next. Not consistent at all. Service is alway good and the beer is always cold. I think we are done though."}
{"text":"Yesss!!! Awesome food and service Im In Love with the freshness of everything that i have had! Truly delish and great service.thank you chanic"}
{"text":"My first visit to Rounders durning their first few weeks open. I placed a to go order through the bar. The staff was friendly and the patrons were so fun! I ended up staying and enjoying a beer with people I'd never met. They let me try the food they ordered and I was extremely impressed. 

My second visit was last night (June 10). I came in to eat dinner with another friend and our boys. My boys are 2 and 4. Her son is 2. We don't get out to dinner much so we thought we'd come to our friendly local restaurant so we could be close to home. We were sat in a booth inside the restaurant, which looks spectacular! While we were eating our kids were eating, playing, saying hi to people in the both behind us. We were having a great time. OUT OF NOWHERE an elderly lady came over to tell us our children were out of control and we didn't belong here. She said we'd be welcomed at Denny's but that this place is NOT for children. Shocked I said a few nasty things and her friend and husband also decided make comments telling us we were bad parents and that she was a regular and she has already made sure we were blacklisted from the restaurant. After everything took place, I spoke with the manager, Ian and start crying I was sad, angry, hurt, you name it I was feeling it. He reassured us that we were fine and our children were fine. He said we are welcome there ANY TIME and so are our children. He was extremely comforting in a stressful situation. Our server, the staff and the management are wonderful! I will be back here again and again. I have a lot of respect for the way the staff handdled our situation last night. I can't say thank you enough. Not to mention the food is AMAZING! 

The restaurant is for families so go and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good most of time. Weekend brunch is the best. The service is great if you go when your regular bartenders are there. Overall, nice spot to chill at. Very clean and minimal cigarette smoke for a bar"}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service!!!  This place is so wonderful and happy.  The food is delicious, the drinks are just right and it's a very fun and friendly atmosphere.  My new place for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  The did have some service issues when they first opened, but the food was consistently very good.  This visit the service was excellent and I was very nicely surprised by their huevos rancheros.  They do over garnish (big wad of sour cream, olives, tomatoes), but next time I'll know to ask for them to hold that stuff.  The main body of the dish is really really good, excellent green chile.  It's great to have a place like this just 1.5 miles from the house.  We'll be regulars.."}
{"text":"Tried their Veggie Terran flatbread and it was great! Veggies were roasted so added a nice smoky kind of flavor combined with the fontina cheese. Not a bad place for a quick bite. Service was decent, but no windows to see outside kinda sucks. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"When you live in Inspirada/Seven Hills...  it's hard to get take out for a BURGER and FRIES and still be HOT by the time you get home, keeping that in mind this place is our solution!  The burgers are great!  The fries are great!  I did just find out they have three types of bread...  I think pretzel roll, chibatta, or brioche (softer yummy hamburger bun)....  and there are several choices Of \"burger\" beef (1/2 pound), vegetarian, turkey, chicken...   they have different toppings like bacon, mushroom, fried jalapeños, egg, grilled onions,etc...   different cheeses, Seriously you could build your own gourmet burger...  I prefer a plain cheeseburger on a regular bun and it's a beautiful big burger!  You can also change up the fries to sweet potato or onion rings OR change it a salad. Its around $10-$13. depending on your build!  So it's our fast food gourmet!  We have dined in/takeout over 20 times...   I also like their chicken wings (huge), wedge salad, and chicken fingers.  Their breakfast is good and a good value!  I'm not in love with their ribs, some weird spice.  Always had great service while dining in, and the bartender is always nice when picking up, offering us water and asking our name, getting to know us!"}
{"text":"I'm a staunch conservative, but this place is racist not welcoming to people of color. I was verbally abused by patron for being brown and bartender ignored this because she didn't know me? Really! I encourage all minority's to monitor this establishment for Racial biases Patrons should not be allowed conduct themselves in this matter unchecked!"}
{"text":"Beer was ice cold, food was amazing, Ashley the bartender was on point! Can I give ten stars???"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for breakfast. The place is a construction zone but that didn't bother us. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Waitress was pleasant. I am giving them four stars because I wish the coffee were hotter, our waitress was a tad more attentive and I wish they had better quality table and chairs. It's annoying to have your chair and table be uneven and would move when you shifted your weight. Good food though so we will be back and ask for a bunch of napkins to put under the legs of our table and chairs."}
{"text":"Took a long shot and went to this local Pub for dinner last night.  The service was good, restaurant clean, open and lite not to dark inside.  Lettuce wedge was crisp and very tasty.  The chicken wings were also good.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time there. Lunch. Had the best turkey burger! Going back soon! Happy to see them in Anthem!"}
{"text":"You would hope being one of the few pubs in the area that they would at the very least, have amazing service! People can't even write an order down properly. Don't even get me started with their food. Keep an eye on a long black hair. No utensils, napkins, condiments? Lucky to get a star. I suggest to drive a few miles for your buck. The end"}
{"text":"This place has become a regular for us.  We love their breakfast, lunch and dinners, even late night menu!  Sign up for text specials and save!  Rounders has AWESOME Burgers with home made CHIPS and dip that are out of this world!  You will walk away Stuffed!!!!"}
{"text":"It's the best local bar/restaurant. The food is EXCELLENT!  The bartenders always have a smile on their face. Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love going to breakfast but there's always a wait on the weekends at our regular places. Decided to give Rounders a shot for breakfast. Decent breakfast menu with some unique items so it's not like every other bar breakfast. Service was great and there was no wait. Portions are big and food was good. We will definitely be back and love that we didn't have to wait 30 mins to get a table and it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"We love to watch football on Sundays and eat here! We ordered to go since the food is so good and due to my pickiness I wasn't too pleased but Ryan took great care of us the next time. So happy there's a friendly neighborhood bar & grill so close to Inspirada! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Coupons were sent to all neighboring residents.  A free $20 game play was included.  When presented to bartender he appeared bent out of shape.  He put players card on top of machine, walked away and said nothing.  I had no idea how the free play worked or how to use it!  He was a jerk!  The food was ok and service was adequate.  Will never return and be surprised if this place survives."}
{"text":"After years of living here. This rounders has been the 5 restaurant to be on this piece of property. Since it open it has had new servers like the amount of customers that come through the door. It's amazing that workers want 15 hr to suck at there jobs. The food has declined since it opened. Wish Anthem could get something decent back here...... also servers need to realize to give equal service regardless the size of the party..... tips stand for time in prompt service...... the turn over is horrible here and the managers should take time in the training..... unless they believe this is customer service....."}
{"text":"I went back and forth on whether this place was a 2 star experience or a 3 star experience. Our server was very nice and attentive when she could be. It definitely seemed like they were running short on staff. I would think that for Sunday breakfast they would have been prepared to handle the usual traffic.

Food was good, but nothing to write home about. 

This place is a decent stopover in the back roads of Sun City Anthem, but no need to make the trek up the Oregon trail. Stop here if you're in the area, otherwise there are plenty of other options.

Would I come back here? I wouldn't go out of my way.

Would I recommend this place to others? Probably."}
{"text":"What a great place!!!  A little out of the way for me, but well worth it.  Clean, classy, exemplary service.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit leery about trying out this place with all the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Two hostesses at the host stand and a buzz of food servers milling around at your Beck and call. So the service is pretty good. Also a decent happy hour menu, cheap drinks, half off food. The kids enjoyed their kids meal and the shrimp tempura was pretty good and at only 5 bucks during happy hour I can't complain. Our server Sarah was cute and bubbly and came around several times to make sure we were doing well. Will definitely be back. Can see this spot as a hangout. Thank God Olivo is finally out! ROUNDERS is a good addition to the shopping plaza. Give this place a chance, people!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and unfortunately it was not the best experience. I recently had oral surgery so I was looking for something soft and easy to eat. I ended up ordering a Grilled Cheese sandwich from the kids menu. I got up charged $2 for ordering as an adult, but I certainly would have cancelled my order if they told me this ahead of time because $8 for Grilled Cheese is insane!! Pictures attached. This was only 2 people's check from a table of 6. Not only that the service was slow and refills or reordering drinks at our table was nonexistent. It wasn't that busy for the service to be this bad."}
{"text":"The food and service is great. We eat breakfast here several times a week. Hillary does a great friendly service, very professional."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we have Rounders in our neighborhood. Food and customer service are always great, and also convenient for when my husband and I don't want to make the 15 min drive to Eastern. All the bartenders there are friendly and the place has a nice vibe. I appreciated it even more after a recent trip to PTs next door - strict drink comp policy for playing at the bar. Place was dead and now I know why. Expect your winnings to go towards drinks at the end ;) ...go to Rounders instead."}
{"text":"We walked in on Sunday at about 12:10am expecting the place to be busy like most restaurants in Las Vegas at this time. The place was almost empty with just two tables occupied with a total of about ten people. I soon discovered why this place was empty at a time and day that most places have a 30-minute wait. 

We sat down and were quickly welcomed and given menus. You have to seat yourself here. We looked at the menu and noticed that there was no breakfast on the menu. Grandma has to have her breakfast after church on Sundays. We asked if they have a breakfast menu. We were told that breakfast is only served until 12pm. The question of why this nice looking restaurant and bar was empty was answered. What restaurant doesn't serve breakfast late on weekends? This place. Have they not heard of brunch? Most of these bar/restaurant combo places serve breakfast 24 hours a day. Even McDonalds and Jack in the Box serve breakfast all day. Rounders is missing out on a lot of revenue here. 

The service was below average. With no one in the restaurant, I expect great service. After our server dropped off our food she checked out. She was only taking care of two tables. It would have been nice to see her again since the mayonnaise was missing from my boca burger. I ordered the turkey burger and substituted it with a boca patty. The menu said my turkey burger came with mayo, but there was none. Our server didn't return for over ten minutes to check on us and by then I was almost done with my burger and didn't need the mayo. My mom also wanted a soda refill and never got that. The other server, who also had two tables, seemed more attentive to her tables. She even cleared our table. I guess two tables was too much for the other server. 

The food was just okay. I would say it is a step below Chilli's or Red Robin. The fries were good. They had a nice crisp on the outside. As we know from above, my turkey burger was dry."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for take out - Chicken Ceasar & the Chili pork Verde - VERY disappointed.  Ceasar had no dressing on it & none on the side...no parmesan cheese & chicken breast was extremely dry. 
Chili Verde was green soup with a huge glib of melted cheese & I think a few pieces of pork the size of a pea. Served with a tortilla, but who eats soup with a tortilla? If I wanted soup, I would have ordered soup. 
We live in the neighborhood and come here frequently, but may have to reconsider. Definitely not doing take out again. 
Lack of consistency is what killed the last restaurant that was in the building. 
Fingers crossed for improvement"}
{"text":"Quick 5 star review. Came on a Saturday morning. It was quiet, but college football was on. Put $20 in the machine, got a 1/2 price app (chili con carne queso dip) and the breakfast special. Service was pleasant and quick. Food was hot and satisfying. Atmosphere was exactly what you'd want for an adult day out. Machine was nice to us too, and our mimosas were never empty. Don't know why people are so picky when it comes to a neighborhood bar. Good food, good service = 5 stars to me. Going back tonight for HH."}
{"text":"Great bar food! Smoking area (bar) is separated from the dining area so you can bring kids in. Service and food is always good. Never ordered anything bad off their menu. Burgers are great."}
{"text":"Seems to us that food quality and options are declining as they expand their empire with more and more locations. Perhaps putting money into real estate and not into the same level of quality they offered formerly."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break. Waitress was friendly although I felt bad for her because she was the ONLY one working tables. They should've had 2 people for the size of the place. 

I had the Rounders Burger and it was really good. Wasn't pleased with the fries. Most of them were hard. I decided to get a martini and ordered the Lotus Blossom. Not a fan. 

Overall not bad."}
{"text":"I only ordered once ToGo. Hamburger and nachos they were just average even with the price kinda high. I would not order food here again."}
{"text":"Went to Rounders for the first time last night after a late soccer practice. Boy was it beyond smokey in there!! My oldest son was complaining the whole time that it smelled so horrible (and it did!) and he wanted to leave the second we got in there.  What's dumb is that they leave the bar door open where people are heavily smoking and it is drifting out into their entryway and dining room. I asked our waitress if she could shut the door and she looked confused and said maybe she could. She never did, I think she forgot or didn't care.  I thought if you allowed smoking in your bar area, that it needed to be closed off to an area where food was being served for the rest of us.  

Service was sloooooow too, nice staff but seemed to be busy with other things like talking to each other and sitting down with friends at another table whom were not even ordering anything.  

Food was actually not bad at all, but the smoke issue makes the experience terrible.  Sad because we could really use a family friendly place up here.  We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't really take the time to write reviews but this place was awful. We have lived in The Club @ madeira for 5 years and were excited to see that Olivios was finally gone and we now had a new place down  the hill. Well lets put it this way.....nothing has changed but the name! 
We went on Wed night to grab a quick dinner, We sat ourselves, and no one even came to our table for 20 min...then had to clean it. There were 3 different servers, none of which were any good. We ordered 2 beers and a sprite...took 20 min. and had to ask for water 3 times. When we finally got someones attn. to place our order the waiter seemed annoyed. We ordered.....our food then took 40 min. Needless to say it wasn't worth the wait, they screwed up my salad....my husbands Chili Verde was like a green soup and my daughters fish and chips were cold. We also ordered and appetizer of calamari, that came out cold with our the rest of the food.  We will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Went for food. Ordered two alcoholic drinks and it took 12-15 minutes to get. restaurant was quiet. Bar about half full. Out waitress only took care of the Restaurant side. Food was very good. My burger was cooked perfectly. Waitress was very nice but , very slow. I think chatting was what she liked best and it showed in the service. I would eat here again because the food was a bit above par , in my opinion. Service was poor. Hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to our area! Friendliest staff, great food and drinks! They are currently remodeling, but staying open. PTs better watch out, the food at Rounders is gourmet compared! Great Ahi tuna and sliders. The owner is always open to suggestions, and is very down to earth. It's our new favorite spot in the 89044!"}
{"text":"We go to Rounders often.  Service is great and so is the food.  A fun place to have a drink, play video poker, and grab some food."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Never too crowded and the happy hour specials are great! 2-6 have plenty of drinks on it and most appetizers are half off. Haven't found a better deal yet personally. Wings are always good and the calamari is a large portion. Kids pizzas are a nice big size , have never personally seen one that big and my son loves them. Will continue to return to this place. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am so relieved that this location has finally turned into something worth going to. I used to go to a rounders all of the time when I lived in the southwest side of town, so it was nice to see a familiar bar/restaurant. I've only gone to this location twice but I don't really have any cons.
The restaurant side is spacious and comfortable with lots of TVs everywhere. They also have a small lounge area with tables and couches. I've gone with several people and have ordered a little of everything. So far, everything has been pretty delicious. My favorite is definitely the ahi tuna on wonton chips (I don't remember the exact name). Tuna was fresh and the flavor was delicious. The best part about the food and drinks is that they have happy hour during game days. Both times I have gone the service has been friendly and quick as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time eating in their resultant...Ahi appetizer was amazing!!!  I was pleasantly satisfied and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We've found a new local - super close - place to sneak away for a drink and some eats at! 

Rounders isn't anything to write home about in regards to food or cuisine. If you want reasonable bar food, good drink prices and specials, lots of TVS for your favorite sports and games, this is a great spot in the Anthem area. 

The staff is inconsistent and sometimes nice while other times not very attentive."}
{"text":"Are the Rounders' owners aware that this place makes you wait in the lobby for 25 minutes when there are five tables open? Are they aware that this practice and closing the extra space off only pisses people off and makes them go to PTs right next door? Waitresses are great and the food is good, but business practices are abysmal! What kind of business conducts operations this way? Do you not want business?"}
{"text":"I have been back dozens of times since last review. I guess Victor isn't there anymore.  Cheesecakes are little frozen hockey pucks.  Gross.  Food has been very inconsistent,  sometimes I get a lot of salad sometimes I get very little, apps are never the same in quality or proportion.   I have to downgrade my rating as the food is so disappointing."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and bloody Mary's around. We have been several times the french toast pancakes and breakfast skillet are amazing. We also enjoy happy hour drinks and food is good. Always clean, service is friendly and priced good. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I was so excited when we first moved here a couple months ago and I had Rounders delivered to our house through an independent app.  However, just a few weeks later I've gone to the restaurant and eaten 4 times, I've also picked up food to go, and it has not been the same. The service there stinks. The food does not seem to be of the same quality either. It seems like they're suddenly cutting corners and using frozen ingredients and less of them. Worst of all the prices, which seemed on the high end for what they served, have not reflected these changes. Now, I feel like I'm being ripped off for their location convenience, which turns out isn't a convenience at all because they can not seem to get my order right. 

I thought I'd give them one last shot tonight. Ordered the soup of the day and a Mediterranean salad. The salad usually has all these vegetables and 2 different cheeses, plus olives over \"field greens\" with a delicious vinaigrette dressing. They said 15 min when I called. I showed up maybe 20 min later. No one greeted me and I had to wait by the kitchen door to get anyone's attention. Then it took them 10 min to find my order (or make it) and when I got home, the soup was cold and the salad pathetic. There were 3 thin strips of zucchini, no olives, hardly any mozzarella and they completely forgot the dressing. Not to mention, these were not the usual field greens. It was chopped up romaine, as if it were left over from a Caesar salad kit. I was very disappointed. It's hard to mess up a soup and salad. They did remember to hold the onions, but maybe that was at the expense of the other vegetables. Bummer, I won't be wasting my money here again. $20 for a bad meal. It would have been better spent at Albertson's next door."}
{"text":"I have been to Rounders several times. The fare is mostly typical sports bar/gambling grub with the exception of a couple of dinner specials --one red meat and one seafood -- both okay but a little skimpy in volume (e.g. four small scallops and risotto only for $17.95!). The service is spotty and depends on which server you get. Last night I ordered a glass of the house cabernet from a female server. A few minutes later a glass of chardonnay arrived from a different server (male). I declined it saying that I ordered cabernet. When my own server returned, I told her I ordered cabernet, not chardonnay. \"My mistake,\"  she said, and left. Minutes later another female server came to the table and said that the house brand was only a chardonnay. \"Look at your own menu,\" I said. \"There is a La Terre cabernet listed.\" More minutes passed. Suddenly my server approached from my blind left and literally SLAMMED a glass of cabernet down on the table in front of me without a word. I never drank the wine, fearing what she or someone else had done to it. There are much better places to dine in the area with more ambience and without the surly service (mainly on S. Eastern Ave.), but there absolutely are none in Anthem, at least until the new restaurant starts up in Anthem Center."}
{"text":"At first Rounders opened and it was refreshing to have a place with good bar food, good service, and average payouts from machines. Now we go in and the food is okay but it's hit and miss, service is mediocre at best, and we never see anyone win on the machines. The bar staff is friendly but it's quickly becoming a typical smelly bar."}
{"text":"My first visit here was at the bar on a fairly busy Friday evening with a party of 2. 
It's a poker bar and it's appointed in typical Vegas poker bar decor. The bartenders call you by name and introduce themselves. I'll give some points for that. The place was recently remodeled after the Olivo Bistro takeover. It definitely got busier as Rounders (a sports bar vibe) and the poker machines are new with some better games. They also have a player's club that comes with bonus text offers if you join that. We had a fairly good time and agreed that it's worth coming back to try the food."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Rounders. I ordered the Brazilian steak salad which was delicious except when they first brought it out the steak was blue I had ordered medium-rare they did make good on it however. The salad was delicious.  My companions both ordered medium rare burgers which came out medium and my other companion ordered a Cobb salad and there was no chopped egg on the salad as promised plus he had ordered a glass of wine which was very very late in coming. The manager made good on all of our complaints and I intend to revisit this restaurant and give them another chance and a fourth star because the food was actually very nice but last night there just seemed to be a bit of confusion in the kitchen and with the wait staff.."}
