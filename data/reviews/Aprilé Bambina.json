{"text":"Visited this restaurant with some friends last night.  I have been waiting for it to open since we heard it was coming as part of the triad of restaurants on the strip.  

The atmosphere is really lovely (aside from the flower piece above the door to go downstairs - it doesn't fit the decor at all).  Beautiful wine display, and very funky and comfortable chairs. 

Over all, great atmosphere.  I LOVE the lights - just so much fun & very old hollywood like. 

Service - wow. yes, the server was VERY new.  She came to the table too soon, called us hun and sweetie.  Please advise her away from doing that -  it felt forced, unprofessional and was just over all annoying. 

Food:

Spagetti
Bolognese
Gluten Free Seafood Penne

The girls loved their food, as did I!  I was shocked it was GF pasta - kinda odd they only have one kinda and charge you $3 more dollars for it.   The pasta wasn't spicy, I am not sure what James up here is talking about.  It was a white wine cream sauce.....there wasn't a bit of heat in it unless you add your own, champ.  Frankly from your description, it does not sound like we ate at the same dish. 

Presentation of the food was lovely.   It was beautiful in fact.   

The girls had the white  chocolate tiramisu.   They loved it. 

None of us had wine but the wine list looked great - they also had speciality cocktails. 

Overall, I am so delighted that this restaurant is a short walk from my house & will certainly be a staple for special events."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and we've been wanting to try this spot.  From the minute we entered it felt like I was at home. Once we were seated our waitress took us through the specials and made some excellent recommendations. We told her our mood and appetite and in a very honest move, told us we were best to have our two apps and share a main. Most places would try to pad the bill but she wanted us to experience the quality.

We had the grilled caesar and the mussels to start. The grilled caesar was something my wife and I never had before and was very unique. Very flavorful and incredible homemade dressing. The mussels were very tender and a great sized portion. The sauce was amazing. 

Our main was the seafood fettuccine  which like the apps was great. Light sauce that wasn't too heavy and full of seafood. 

We shared a bottle of wine that was reasonably priced and sadly didn't leave room for dessert. Great service and excellent food.  We'll definitely be back. Thanks for the great date night!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic with authentic Italian food. I've been here 4 times already each time ordering different dishes to be pleasantly surprised with the jammed pack flavours each dish provides. Since this place opened around the corner from where I live, whenever my friends come over to visit, I always suggest to come here and they always love it"}
{"text":"Great pizza, thin crust and a decent size.  Grilled Caesar salad was delicious but large crouton a bit on the stale side.
We did take out and by the time we got home all was good, food travelled well.  Wish they had delivery!  While waiting for the order, the staff was absolutely lovely, welcoming and a pleasure to chat with.  Will definitely go and enjoy a meal in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came back again on Saturday night, place was steady but not completely dead.

Luckily we were sat in Jaquiline's section again, so the service was amazing as usual. They had an Italian beef stew on special that really hit the spot and warmed me up from the cold walk over. 

Food and atmosphere is just as amazing as we remembered, we might have to make this place a staple for date night."}
{"text":"Happy to see this in our hood! Just tried it today and loved the pasta; and my friend requested an off-the-menu salad which they accommodated. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"I've only had takeout but some of my favorite italian food. Love the grilled ceaser salad and the white chocolate tiramisu is so good. I love the spagetti with goat cheese. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Appetizer was great but entree was too salty. Would return to try other things but not in a hurry to do so.

{"text":"We found this place looking for a nice spot to have a date night.  Happily for us they happened to have a Wednesday night couple's special.  For about $25 each we got an app, main, and dessert.  It sounded like it would be an ongoing deal for a while at least.

The food and atmosphere were great.  The grilled ceasar salad was a new taste for me.  The lettuce is grilled before it's added to the salad.  The pasta dish and pizza we got were both excellent.  

The restaurant is tastefully decorated, has fitting music playing, and cloth napkins.  It's a nice place to dress up a bit to go to and you can definitely invite company that's looking for a fancier evening.  It was fairly empty, there was one other group while we were there, which made for a very relaxed and attentive waitress, but I hope it fills a bit more soon.  It's an Italian gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant, so homey. 
Friendly, attentive and delicious food. Adam was our server - what a delight. The food was not rushed the pasta was served hot and was so tasty. 

We orders dessert and Adam brought us Lemoncello. He was reading my mind. I couldn't decide if I wanted some, then there it was. 

We are definitely coming back.

The patio is a nice and quiet. What a great place to enjoy and meal and have a conversation."}
{"text":"So the service is great, the ambiance is good and the food is adequate.  An Italian place that does not make it's own meatballs.. come on. Yes I know they are bought as I have worked in the business.  Want so much better from them."}
{"text":"It's great to see places like this popping up in the neighbourhood but I was disappointed with the quality of the food. You can find fantastic Italian food everywhere in Toronto so I guess I was expecting a lot. But if I'm going out for pizza or pasta, it needs to hit the mark. The pizza here was pretty terrible...  just tasteless dry dough...  and my bf had lamb ragout pasta, and yeah the portion was big but all we could taste was garlic. Maybe we shouldn't have chosen pizza or pasta at this Italian pizza & pasta restaurant.

Everyone seems to be blown away so far..... is it just because we're so happy to have something in the neighbourhood other than GBK and the food court at gerrard square mall? well played Aprile Bambina, well played..."}
{"text":"We got take out. Once of the worst experiences of take-out we've had.

The pizza sounded really good, so we ordered.
Well first off an hour passed (ordered  on a wednesday night around 7). Called to see what happened, and the lady was confused and said it had gone out ages ago. 

Eventually we did receive the pizza, after another 10 minutes. It was small, dried out a little and cold. The garlic bread we ordered was half a small, soggy baguet cut in half, and they had ordered 4 pops but only 2 arrived. The walnut pizza had like 3 small crumbs of walnut on it. 
It was NOT worth what we paid - for the money we paid we had way better expectations than this. Friend did not even want to call back and make a complaint, to spare us from another hour wait and cold food.

To be avoided!"}
{"text":"We popped in for dinner yesterday with no reservation, and despite the place being packed, the staff still managed to find us a table for two. The inside is cozy: exposed brick, fairy lights, and big red leather chairs. 

THE GOOD:
- Fresh bread while waiting for our food - yum!
- We had the charcuterie board as our starter, which came with pears, walnuts, olives, and a side of honey to drizzle over everything. This was delicious - my favourite was the blue cheese, which was strong but not overly pungent. 
- The star of the show was my entrée: the pear and gorgonzola pizza. It took me forever to decide on what to order - there are so many amazing pizza and pasta choices - but this did not disappoint. It had a thin crust, a very generous amount of cheese, and the pears added a really nice sweetness. They serve it with a pizza cutter, so you can cut the slices to your liking - I thought that was a nice touch (even though I was terrible at cutting it neatly). 
- We were in good hands with our server. He was attentive without being overly chatty. 

THE BAD: 
- My boyfriend had the seafood fettuccine. It was good, but the sauce was a little on the watery side. We would recommend sticking to the pizzas or trying another pasta dish. 

Overall, Aprilé Bambina is an awesome spot in a neighbourhood that doesn't have many Italian options. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday and were looking forward to what sounded like a solid menu. The food didn't disappoint with good portions and pricing. The service however was really off putting. From the moment I called to make a reservation I was told that it was so busy they'd have to call me back. How long does it take to make a reservation?? This should have been a warning.

When we arrived the waiter must have asked 5 times if we wanted drinks even though we had said we were fine with just water. At one point during the meal some people near us were complaining that their orders were wrong. The waiter proceeded to blame them and said there was nothing he could do. He then apologized to all of the other tables nearby  that the people at the table had made such a fuss, although he was the only one  who seemed upset by these people's reasonable complaints and respectful tone. Quite puzzling...

When it came time to pay he said it was impossible to separate the bill. I asked if he could help by simply using his calculator at the desk to add up the dishes that I had ordered and he said this was too complicated and had to go get the manager. This lack of problem solving or any kind of accommodation for simple requests was astounding. He actually insisted that I had to take out my phone and do the math myself while he stood there and stared. Thank goodness his manager had some better common sense and helped break out the bill.

You're simply not gonna make it in this business if you get so stressed out over a split bill. If it's that big of an issue maybe think to ask how people will pay upfront like so many other places do.

Unfortunately the service spoiled the experience. Unless there's some staffing changes not worth the trip back. There are too many other choices with excellent food to put up with this nonsense."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Cute little family Italian restaurant.  Lasagna was a little salty, but nice portion  Also tried the Pear salad and Torte dessert, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice ambiance. Amazing service. Beef cheeks had nice flavor.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here (her suggestion) for her birthday and we had a pleasant experience. While I can't speak for her meal, I had a delicious soup and a very yummy pizza, which was served on a wooden board. Although we waited a bit for the order, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for the area that is trying to rejuvenate the neighbourhood.  The food is standard Italian home cooking and I enjoyed my tagliatelle pasta with beef cheeks.  It was deliciously comforting.  The portions are ample except for the bruschetta.  It was delightfully garlicky but just not enough!!!  Please put more:(  But other than that in a pinch I will go here if I ever find myself jonesing for Italian in the east end."}
{"text":"Wow!  A good find in our own neighbourhood!  Reasonably priced, great friendly staff, and awesome food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Leslieville is a popular hangout! I dropped by the new opening of Aprilé Bambina Cusina. The place is fantastic! You walk in and it's that feeling of being welcomed into a large Italian family.

The decor is warm and traditional - a lot of red, including the padded leather chairs. There's even a bicycle hanging from the ceiling.

Things you have to try: grilled caesar salad. There's that charred smokey flavour that is out of this world. It's also house made dressing!

Also, I like it spicy so I ordered the spicy Bambina chicken rigatoni. The pasta was a perfect al dente and it was pipping hot, heat and temperature wise.

Make sure to finish the meal with an apple cinnamon sweet pizza and a coffee or espresso."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine. Nice to have in our neighborhood. Service was great,  thanks Kaitlan."}
{"text":"This is a cozy place that, from my experience planning to go there and passing it by on the street, fills up quickly.  This, of course, is for very good reason as the food is quite splendid.   

The portions are ample, but not obscene, which is great for me since it makes it easy to justify having an appetizer and a main course in the same meal.  Both are reasonably priced.  I think the most expensive thing on the menu was about 22 dollars.  Not pricey at all for the ambience and quality of food, its taste and presentation.

I had beef cheeks with paparadelle.  The pasta was perfectly cooked; the beef cheeks were tender and the sauce was some bit of creamy heaven.  Before that I had a mixed green salad with grilled shrimp and squid.  I liked it so much that I silently hated my 2 year old daughter for a minute when she accidentally dropped one of my precious shrimps on the floor.  grrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Vegetarians have more than enough to choose from here too.  My wife had a fantastic veggie pasta with goat cheese and veggies;  thankfully her appetite was not large enough to finish it.  That forced me to care for it deeply the next day for lunch....IN MY STOMACH.

This strip of Gerrard is the perfect spot for this fantastic place.  I wrote this review with the sole intention of helping their success as they deserve it wholeheartedly.

Bravo."}
{"text":"Its a strange combination,  the food wasn't good enough to be great,  and the prices weren't low enough that it could be considered a deal.  So I guess I'd describe it as average food for higher than average prices.
The place looks great in and out, I'm hoping it settles in and finds an identity and becomes a solid choice amongst the other newish offerings."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi I've ever had outside of home. That says a lot coming from an Italian who's only enjoyed homemade."}
{"text":"This is a little gem on the outskirts of Leslieville. My friend had been wanting to go here for months now, and miraculously there was parking outside....and free to boot! I'm sure it was well worth the wait and he won't be waiting long to go back, because the food was the kind of comforting Italian that you can just melt into. The menu is simple and concise (just the way I like them because I'm uber indecisive), with the usually antipasti, pizzas and pastas. After a long winded debate in my head, I decided on the beef cheek braised with onions and red wine over housemade pasta. My dinnermate had spaghetti and meatballs. I absolutely loved my beef cheeks, tender enough to break apart with a fork, but maintained meaty bite. I could taste every ingredient in the braise from the gently cooked onions to the luscious red wine. I didn't really want to share my dish, so I didn't dare ask for some spaghetti. But I hear it's as good an Italian sister-in-law....which sounds pretty good to me."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off By saying that if licking your plate clean was socially acceptable I would have done it. 50 times over. 

My wife had been here twice prior to us going on a date. Once with a gf of hers and once with my mother and hers. I was really excited to go tonight, and so glad I did.

I'm very very fond of patios in Toronto. There are quite a few patios I like but this place has my favourite patio now. It's not something you'd expect, my romantic, spacious but small, modern and clean. Perfect. The inside of the restaurant is quite small too but also clean, modern and romantic. 

The service was great. We were attended to by a few different people, all of which were naturally friendly and attentive. We did not have to wait long to be seated, to get our drinks, and to get our dinner.

The food was really really good. I mean, I would have licked my plate, as I've said before. I had the gnocchi with bacon and chicken, my wife had the home made tomatoe soup and mushroom bruschetta (although oddly it didn't made together - the mushroom and lettuce was separate from the bread with cheese on it). Our meals were still great.

I think for 2 drinks, two appetizers paired as a meal and my gnocchi entree - paying $54 and change was a fair price. 

I loved it here. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had our first visit last night and was blown away. Excellent service. We order the daily special of chicken fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli and roasted peppers. It was fantastic. The service was excellent and the food was delivered hot and fresh the way it should be. As for the taste... Wow... I really enjoyed it. Also ordered the bruschetta and the cheesecake desert. Both were good, but the bruschetta is probably the best I have ever had. I would recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"When my dad visits me from out of town, he always wants Italian food and outside Little Italy we have had very little luck. , but this place is amazing . Pasta was so tender, and sauces balanced well, meat seasoned just right. Plus super super kid friendly without compromising  ambiance."}
{"text":"This place had great ambience and was quiet on a Monday night with a couple of people dropping by. Just one person to serve and manage the bar, which is fine on such a quiet night I suppose.

They brought bread at the start which was meh - didn't taste fresh or anything. But they pured a decent balsamic vinegar for us, and had an olive oil on the table which I didn't try.

The food came fairly soon, and was great. My friend had the ravioli which she said was very good. Her portion was quite small though. The fetuccine with wild mushroom and italian sausage was good. The sausage was crumbled and though I didn't taste a lot of mushroom, the dish was delicious anyway. The portion of the fettucine was quite good. There were three white wines and three red wines if you go by glass. They range from $6.5 to $12 a glass.

The tiramisu was excellent and probably one of the best I've had. It's a white chocolate tiramisu. Definitely worth a try.

Pricing - I thought personally it's a tad bit overpriced. For this location and type of restaurant, I'd expect about $12-14 a pasta. I pay $15-20 for far more gourmet pastas and experiences. But since the food was really tasty, I'm not complaining about that. If you're in the neighbourhood, it's definitely worth dropping by here."}
{"text":"My friends suggested this place for dinner. It was very good. I ordered a pasta and my portion was smaller than everyone else's so I asked the waiter. They fixed it and brought me some more so I was happy. It was delicious and they apologized for the mistake. All in all, I would say it is a nice little spot. The bike on the wall makes it unique. When a restaurant makes a slight mistake and then shows genuine concern and makes up for it, they reputation goes way up for me!  Looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"ive been meaning to try Aprile for months but i dont get to justify pasta too often ;) called in for a takeout order, spoke to owner who was a gentleman and easy to chat with. he gladly fixed me a carbonara w/ spaghettini (custom request) and the order was ready in the exact time he specified. Pasta was very very well done, just the right amount of creamy, with loads of pancetta, diced in the perfect size so it wasnt over powering and provided lots of delicious salty unctuous taste. It was just wonderful. The caesar was also great, although as a takeout order i should have actually put it on a plate instead of eating from the container as that provided a bit difficult. either way, service was great, food was great, price was great. cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"I think this place is our new local. The pastas are delicious and a good size. We tried the grilled caesar which has a nice rustic presentation and great flavor. I tried the Gnocchi Aprile and it melted in my mouth. The decor is very warm and inviting and the staff are laid back and professional."}
