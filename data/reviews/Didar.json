{"text":"If you like spicy Indian food with true \"Punjabi\" flavors this is the place. Don't expect a fancy dine-in, just good food. Service is little slow so keep a lot of time in hand. Try for kababs, tikka's & freshly made naan bread. They accept credit card which is good as most place I have been in jean talon do not."}
{"text":"Great Indian food at great prices. Loved the Naan , butter chicken and everything else at their lunch buffet. Recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Best paneer masala in town next to Chandibad on Cote-des-Neiges. The food is excellent, always great quality. If you're on Victoria street, pick this restaurant over Jol√©e. Doesn't even compare."}
{"text":"Perfect place for authentic Indian cuisine. It's not a fancy place but food is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Very delicious Indian food, very efficient & fast service at a very reasonable place. The Aloo tikki and pakora are the best starters!"}
{"text":"I had veg tali cauliflower/potato and chickpeas. I'm not an Indian food expert but I really love this place cheap and they give a lot always full and happy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the butter chicken along with the chicken biryani. The prices and portions were reasonable. The butter chicken was very tender and the chicken biryani was very flavorful! :) Both dishes were delicious and I will definitely go back! :)"}
{"text":"Pushap? Cheap and greasy. Tanjay, not bad but I'm not sure why it didn't impress me. Le Taj? Great but overpriced. Didar? Boom! The sweet spot. So overjoyed today for finally finding this Indian place where they managed to bring the best, most deliciously prepared succulent dishes accompanied with friendly, aim to please attitude and all for a reasonable and fair price. Ok ok, Yelp and Yelp friends helped me a lot of course discovering this truly hidden gem. All the credits go to them and I thank them for their honest and just reviews. Kudos. 

We ordered Chana samosa, samosas, shrimp masala, lamb karahi, paneer saag, butter chicken, spinach, potatoes and chicken naan and rice. One is better than the next but got to say the lamb karahi was the star amongst today's choices. No funky smell or anything, fall off the bone tender juicy meat. Just amazing! A bit too much food for 4 where we got stuffed and had to ask to take the leftover home. When asked our spiciness level, we had to go between mild and medium. Not to my liking of course but had to be accommodating to the rest on the table. Sigh  

The place is not one of the best looking but it's clean, modest and has this authentic setting. Who cares about the looks? Once you start eating their super tasty food and the wine you brought with you, looks of the place won't matter. You're now indulged in gluttony ...Nothing else matters at this point my friend. Just dig in and enjoy the moment. 

I will most definitely come back and try the other goodies. This place is waaay up on my Indian resto list now. Number 1 for sure. Most likely will come alone at least once and ask them to make it extra spicy for me bcs my usual company are bunch of chicken with weak tolerance for spicy and hot food. I must've been an Indian in my previous life just bcs I love their food with their same tolerance level for spiciness.
An amazing find indeed."}
{"text":"We ordered online on a whim and were really happy with it! The food is super flavourful and comforting. It also has so many delicious and varied vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal here with a group. Flavors are well balanced. It's probably one of the few places where I want to eat vegetables. I had spinach paneer, eggplant, lentils and okra. The okra and lentils were really good.The okra in particular seemed really fresh. Eggplant was probably the least impressive but still enjoyable. Rogan josh lamb was tasty.The chicken biryani was very strong with the spices. The naan wasn't as crispy on the outside as I would've liked but it was otherwise soft and fluffy and a perfect medium for soaking up all the curries and sauces. There are a fair amount of tables. Prices are reasonable with many dishes around $10 (less for veggies, more for meats). The ingredients are fresh and the quality of the cooking is great. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"A family managed business. Cozy restaurant with a rich menu. Decent prices and quality Indian food. You could go mild or medium spice-wise. I did medium and loved it. Naan, lamb curry and dessert is all I had and almost no complaint. Indeed I would go more lean lamb instead. But it was ok."}
{"text":"So unfortunate to have moved away from this part of the city. 

Had a serious craving for Indian food so we went on a little walk and found this restaurant. It was midday and we saw a sign for an AYCE buffet for what I think was $11.00 (no more than $12.00). We were a little wary being vegetarians and not knowing what would be offered but the staff was so welcoming and kind and showed us the whole spread so that we could decide. And after seeing what was offered we would be silly to have declined. 

The buffet included flavourful dishes both meaty and vegetarian, with an appetizer section including salad, samosas and naan that kept on coming. 

We were beyond satisfied with our small adventure here and are even planning on taking a trek to this side of the city just to enjoy this wonderful restaurant again.

So to sum it all up:
Flavourful filling food
Extremely friendly staff
Affordable prices"}
{"text":"This place keeps changing between Dev and Didar. The food is always solid and pricepoint is good. People I know who have spent substatial amounts of time or are from India like this place, so it's probably good."}
{"text":"I visited Didar for dinner on a quiet Wednesday Evening.
There were a few group of people enjoying their dinner and a steady stream of take out orders coming in and out so it seemed like a good sign.

We ordered an entree of veggie pakora, Butter Chicken, Saag Lamb and a Chickpea Chana with two garlic naan bread.

Everything was hot, fresh and very well seasoned.

I will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant I've tried in Montreal. Delivery's always on time, even during snowstorms!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends from northern India.
We all got the lunch buffet with a side of naan (obviously) and some additional kebabs. Everything was delicious. My personal favorites from the buffet were the paneer and the butte chicken, but they did  also have lamb and some veggie samosas that others at the table liked. Prices were also extremely reasonable at around $11pp."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to take away a star to my favorite Indian restaurant.  We were told 'sorry there's a man waiting for a table' aka 'leave' 10 minutes after our last bite of food.. And there's the fact that there were dirty tables that could have been taken care of so the man could have had his place.

It is sad because one thing I really liked about this place is that they were not rushing their clients to eat fast like robots and then leave  like the ones on jean talon/acadie but it seems they are starting to follow the trend as well :(

Hopefully it won't happen again"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken thaali and it was delicious. Fresh and their Naan is the best! Loved it. It's usually so affordable and it fills you up. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! My girlfriend says it was the best samosas she ever had. She's a vegetarian and had the thali vegetarian plate and loved it. I had the butter chicken and loved it. The naan bread was also amazing. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I've probably been 5 times now, including last night. For my full review, please visit: https://wordpress.com/posts/therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends tonight. Probably my favourite Indian restaurant. The room is clean, food is nice. I would recommend the butter chicken. It's close to the metro orange line station so it's very easy to get there. After all, food is nice, and cheap."}
{"text":"Update (June 2018): I've been back and what I left out from my first review continued again. I'll update this later. I hope they realize that most brown South Asians understand What they're saying in Punjabi because we've grown up watching Bollywood movies all our lives not to mention the fact that our parents also speak Hindi very clearly because our countries were once emerged and considered one single country."}
{"text":"I had alot of doubt as the food in Montreal has been extremely bland, and in extremely small portions.  I figured...aye if it sucks... i'll deal with it. I was given the menu and saw that the items listed the ingredients (which isn't really common in most indian spots that ive visited). We ordered the Chicken tikka masala and the mango chicken, along with garlic naan. This is the best Indian food that i've ever had in my life so far. In most western European countries, the chicken tikka masala are stew based. In the US, it's very cream based. THIS had the perfect mix of cream (35%) and stew. Robust flavor in each bite. The Garlic Naan, with actual diced garlic cloves, was PERFECT. It was so soft and tender, while have a crispy edge. The price was also reasonable. I'm extremely happy to this place for preventing me from giving up hope for properly seasoned and DELICIOUS food in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ordered the Channa Bathura, basmati rice, tandoori naan, butter chicken, and beef korma. Everything was delicious. The curries were well spiced with deep flavours. The chicken was not dry and the beef was really tender. Soaked up all the sauce with the naan and bathura. Service was good. The young man was quite polite. Will definitely return and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love the butter chicken thali! Fresh hot naan, lots of butter chicken sauce, we usually order the vegetable pakoras as well for appetizers, that come with an assortment of yummy sauces. Good portion, reasonable prices, BYOW, friendly and efficient service, conveniently located near the metro, one of my fav spots for authentic Indian food!"}
{"text":"Great quality Indian food. Came here for the lunch buffet and it did not disappoint. The options were butter chicken, chicken curry, a spinach dish, lentils, rice, vegetables, samosas, and a sweet Indian delicacy for dessert. I spoke to one of the people who work there and they said that these dishes vary throughout the week. All the dishes were full of flavour, the meats were very tender and did not look like they were just sitting there all day. One thing that I noticed was that, although the food was great, they could've made them a little hotter and potentially spicier (I'm a fan of spicy food). All in all, great meal, great value and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I luved the Chicken Tikka !!!! 
This place is a  jewel  of Indian cuisine yet not that busy - we were one of only 3 couples in the whole place.  At 18:30 hrs on a Saturday...  
The service is courteous and efficient"}
{"text":"Great lunch option! (4.5**)

We had the buffet for lunch yesterday and enjoyed the variety and hearty flavours. Things could have been warmer, yes. But all you can eat indian food for 10$ makes you forget the flaws. I was surprised that we were just one of two occupied tables at prime lunch time. Maybe people don't know about the deal because now that I do, you can bet I'll be back!

The naan came out fresh and hot and was just to my liking. The restaurant itself is not fancy but seems to be clean. The staff were nice and welcoming. They do delivery for 3$ on orders more than 30$ so I will probably take advantage of this at some point. Looking forward to trying some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"We had Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Jalfrazi, it was absolutely great. 
I for a moment  forgot that I was sitting in an Indian restaurant in Canada."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a large menu selection. Low prices and large portion. Very friendly personnel. Quick service."}
{"text":"The food here is quite excellent, and I've ordered delivery each time. While once the driver had forgotten a naan (part of the order), they created no fuss, and promptly showed up with a fresh replacement. The food quality and spice levels are quite authentic (food prepared to taste as well). Really do recommend the sweets, especially the laddoos and lassi."}
{"text":"Best Naan ever! The tikka masala was also great. I will return."}
