{"text":"I decided to stop in some time ago and check out the store because I wanted to try to find some of the same meats and cheeses I had when I visited Europe. I got in and began looking and asking questions she seemed like she was rushing me! I decided to buy some cold cuts and she tells me that the meat slicer is only for decoration! Finally some guy comes in and stands by the door and only than did she calm down. I decided to go on a shopping spree just to prove a point that I wasn't there to rob her stupid ass! I've never been back.   Message to the owner: Not all black people steal and we actually do visit other countries to learn other cultures. Looks like you've allowed some racist assholes to shape your opinion on black culture!"}
{"text":"We love Ana and we love Ana's store!!! The most important thing for my husband and me is the friendly attitude of the host. She's amazing))) We would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Good variety of European produces, I like it and I will go back, Anna makes the most delicious mici, and good in price."}
{"text":"Great store if you are craving Romanian food.  Mici (Romanian sausage), cozonac, carnati, etc..  Reasonable prices and a very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I searched for a Romanian store in the greater Phoenix area and this was the only one that showed up. The rest were general European markets. I initially came to get a friend of mine, who's Romanian, some authentic goodies for their birthday. Ana was very helpful and guided me to the perfect products, some cookies and wine that are very popular back home.   The store has beer, also meats, jams, and food that can be prepared for bbq, like sausages. So I'll be back for that. :)"}
{"text":"The store is closed. Finally made it there (I live 1.5 hrs away) and they're not even open. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Called to make sure they had mici (skinless sausage.) She said she is gonna make some fresh so I went and got them when they were ready.   She speaks Romanian & makes amazing mici! Like homemade ones! I definitely recommend this place! There is 12 mici in a box.   She also sells other stuff like slanina(bacon), c√¢rnai(sausage), varza murata(sour cabbage) & a bunch of other European goods."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and very authentic. Customer service is sweet, courteous and on point. Grateful to find this place and so excited to go here more often."}
{"text":"Found this unpretentious store by accident, while driving past a small strip mall. The store is actually larger, than you would expect. The proprietor's name is Ana. She took time to answer my questions. She is knowledgeable about all the products in the store, and shows obvious pride in her product selection. Prices are competitive. Ana also carries selected homemade delicacies, such as Romanian sausage. I have visited the store twice, and I have been pleased with my purchases both times. I highly recommend visiting this store.  No, I am not connected with the store in any way. I am just a happy customer."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little store with goodies from all over Europe, mostly eastern European countries. Ana is from Romania, the store prior to Ana's arrival was all Russian. We get some amazing food from here, that you won't find in the local Groceries. For example yesterday I cooked Ana's homemade skinless sausage. I will be getting more of those, I tell ya. She has had some cured salmon that with cream cheese and a bagel that is a piece of Heaven. Wines, cheese, meats, Jams, Pickles, spices and so much more. Walk in and talk to Ana... your tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"Let me just start with admitting that I was born, raised and educated in Romania, hence some might think that I am biased in my opinion about this place. Far from the truth...  Visited today with my wife (Minnesota girl) and we were met with a warm greeting by the owner, Ana. Upon my first impression, I didn't think we're going to find what we were looking for, some fresh Farmers Cheese, a.k.a. \"Branza de vaci\". Lo' and behold, Ana directed us to her refrigerator where she had 3-4 varieties of it. Ended up buying some mici or mititei  (skinless sausages), Romanian beer and spices. Ana has quite a variety of Eastern European sausages and salami, also cheeses, Tarama (fish roe or caviar), Romanian wines, pickled vegetables, Sauerkraut and a lot more. Too bad there is no authentic Romanian restaurant in the Valley but at least one can find some authentic Eastern European and Romanian products here in hot AZ.  Bravo Ana for being enterprising and taking a chance with your Delicatessen store. We'll definitely visit you often."}
{"text":"Great selection of Romanian and European foods.  Sausages,  cheeses,  wines, mineral water, fruit preserves,  sweets,  pastries and more!  The owner is very pleasant and friendly,  and very knowledgeable about the products in the store! Sometimes she makes salata de icre,  salata de vinete,  sarmale,  r?cituri.  She makes fresh mititei on a regular basis.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Found this place by mistake and I love that they have this Romanian skinless sausages called mici. Owners was very nice and helpful. I will totally come back here"}
{"text":"The best little supermarket to get Romanian food!! I think there is Polish and Russian products as well. Get the handmade traditional Romanian sausages (mici/mititei) as she sells them by the pound!"}
{"text":"The best Romanian sausage ever , best cabbage rolls very friendly I just love this store"}
