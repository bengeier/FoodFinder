{"text":"Wonderful dinner. Every single dish was delicious! Kids loved them too. Service was great. Staff were all so friendly. We started with octopus, soup, buratta.  Then into blueberry risotto,  rigatoni,  ravioli,  veal. Very unique,  great flavor, without overpowering,  very fresh. Not salty, just right. Blueberry risotto was yummy. The walnut gave the dish a very nice flavor. House bread was fresh and delicious.  Spaghetti gelato was great. Coffee was a bit old and not hot but that's ok."}
{"text":"The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, modern and classy with marble tables and comfortable seating. I got the chicken scallopini entree. Our waitress told us the noodles for their dishes are made in house. I sampled my friend's veal noodle entree which was delicious. Not only are you served oil with bread but also balsamic and parmesan. Looking forward to going back and trying different noodles entrees."}
{"text":"Excellent and Outstanding service by Dan J!!! made our first trip with the family special... also a shout out to Chef's Brandon and Dwight... can't forget the New Restaurant Manager Bob!!

Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The service, decor, food drinks and ambiance are all amazing. Their pasta is made in-house and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the meat and cheese board. Can't wait to come back and try the fish and filet!"}
{"text":"Grilled octopus is one of my favorite things to eat. This chef made it perfectly! Tender, well seasoned, not over-charred and with an excellent/light accompaniment. 
I ordered it to go...lady who answered the phone was super pleasant, food was ready when I got there.
Fantastic experience all around!!
Restaurant itself looks really nice, not stuffy or stale and then menu sounds great. 
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch at Il Venetian which is a new addition to dining options in downtown CLE. I'm not usually too excited about restaurants in the lobbies of hotels but Il Venetian appears to be a rare exception. It's well decorated, bright, and has the feel of a high-end Italian restaurant that you would find in Little Italy. I had Gnocchetti with chicken sausage saffron, and Pecorino Romano. It was good but what blew me away was the appetizer. We opted for the Wagyu Carpaccio appetizer to share and agreed that it may have been the best lunch appetizer either of us have ever had. I wouldn't hesitate to get this again. I understand that a gelato and doughnut bar is also opening in the building and will be operated by the same management and I am eager to try those out too!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected pleasure! I frequently stay at the Marriott hotel and this is the new restaurant attached to the hotel. My server Jacob was a pleasure and was happy to make recommendations for wine and dinner. He recommended the Mafaldine Mushroom pasta which was amazing for any lover of mushrooms and truffles! My wine was a Gavi which I honestly never had but similar in dry whites to a Pinot Grigio. Could not be happier! Thank you for the great service and excellent food! Cheers until next time!"}
{"text":"Impressive menu and food. Enjoyed all the food we ordered: calamari, sea bream, bread, lobster pasta, etc. not great location as of now within the hotel with construction going on but hopefully this will change with their new entrance. Definitely worth a try as none of the food was a disappointment and some very great dishes."}
{"text":"Wow!

Came here for father's day and it was truly excellent. 
The quality of the food was top drawer.  The house salad alone was scrumptious and full of flavor.  The mushroom pasta was incredible and the eggplant roll was juicy and tasty.  

The service was warm and friendly and made me miss living in the midwest. 

The decor was rich without being too glitzy.  A wonderful spot that I hope Clevelanders embrace."}
{"text":"I like the place. Ambience was cozy and inviting. The place had just opened so it wasn't crowded at all. The receptionist was friendly and helpful girl- she easily arranged me another table when I disliked first one. The waiter was professional and informative about the menu. He gave me hints about the restaurant's specialty and answered all my questions. 
The food really tasted well. I ordered tuna- and it was a light and healthy option of the menu. My friend ordered a duck what was also very good! However, I was not impressed by dessert- chocolate hazelnut cake. The presentation was cool but tasted so-so. 
In general, I liked the place and definitely recommend to try it."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner here last week.  Was in town for the NCAAs tournament and staying at the hotel.  I always need at least one good Italian dinner when I'm traveling and this did not disappoint!  

Tried a good baseline dish--the rigatoni and meatballs.  Totally awesome meatballs..soft, big and super flavorful.  The sauce was off the hook and probably the most important part of the dish.  The rigatoni was homemade and perfectly cooked...yum!

Of equal importance was the fact that they had cannolis!  They did a new twist on this that I've never seen before.  They stack them up in chunks and while it took me by surprise I think I prefer this over the tube.

Overall great food,  beautiful setting, and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Loved it. Eight of us had a wonderful dinner. Especially enjoyed the blueberry risotto. It had a mild fruit flavor coupled with walnuts. The cheeses on the antipasto platter were served at the perfect temperature. The blue was deliciously runny. Service was very helpful and always available. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian flavors in the bread, cheeses, and pomodoro sauce that I had. 

Hard to believe this experience will be even better after the construction is finished. 

Quality bursts beyond the food as well - from the steak knife that came with my entree, down to the takeout containers.

Bravo!"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch. The portions were larger than I expected (which made me happy) and everything was delicious. The dishes we ordered were the eggs benedict, carbonara,eggplant rolatini and frittata. Bread was fresh and the seasoned oil had the perfect seasoning in it  and then they brought out butter and jellies that were wonderful as well. The restraunt was beautifully decorated and the employees were on top of everything."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at Il Venetian. The space is bright, modern and well appointed. There is a great large wine list and all the staff I encountered from the host to the waiter assistant were polished and pleasant. Bob the manager was attentive, stopped over a couple of times at my table to make sure both the appetizer and entree were good, and was very personable. All the servers I overheard and witnessed including Noah who waited on me were very polished and polite and helpful. 

The octopus appetizer was very good. The appetizer portion was large. The octopus was cooked great and tasted great. The salad and tomatoes that accompanied it went well with it and the creamy sauce. 

The pappardelle that I got for my main was also a good portion size. The wild boar meat with the pasta tasted great and all the items in the dish went well together. The pasta was cooked just right. 

The tiramisu for dessert was made in house and was a creative take on the traditional dessert. The top layer of the circular tower was a chocolate shell containing an espresso cream. This really made the coffee flavor evident in the dessert and gave great texture to all the lower layers. 

So many items on the menu looked great and everything I saw coming out of the kitchen was presented in a really creative way. The food looked amazing and tasted great too. This is a modern Italian restaurant that I will look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Located inside the under construction Marriott hotel, this restaurant is very beautiful- but that's pretty much it. The service was so-so. Our waiter was very nice however the service was extremely slow. Took almost an hour to get our entrees. The appetizers were the best of part of the meal- we had the octopus, ricotta eggplant, and calamari. The Caesar salad was yummy. The entrees were horrible. Any and all of the fish dishes we had were super salty and extremely fishy- the lobster ravioli dish and ink squid tuna dish in particular. The grilled yellow fin tuna came out cold. Those that ordered the veal chop and short rib seemed to have enjoyed it. Another upsetting thing was that the only place to park was the hotel valet which you had to pay $15 for and took forever- the restaurant said they would comp us on the way out but they didn't. Overall I am disappointed by my experience at such a beautiful and new restaurant. They have lots of kinks to work out from service to the menu. It is a VERY expensive place to dine- probably $12-$50 an item, so I would probably wait a while before coming here again. I'm giving this place 3 stars for how nice the staff were, the appetizers/salads, and the ambiance overall. And as a side note, no bathrooms inside the restaurant- you have to go upstairs to the second floor of the hotel."}
