{"text":"Took 1,5 hours for delivery, so 40 minutes late. Cold food, tastes so bland, no cutlery , no napkins. So disappointed !! Worst falafel pita of my life"}
{"text":"Ordered a meal for 4 people for delivery. 40 minutes later I receive a notification that the restaurant cannot deliver because it is too busy. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Beware of MOULD. We had such a bad experience, that I had to create a Yelp account just to post a negative review of this restaurant.

Ordered a meal from Nowshak using the Just Eat food delivery app. The hummus had mould on it. Usually we feed the kids first, so we're glad we spotted the mould before anyone had a chance to eat. 

I sent photos of the mould to Just Eat customer service and they genuinely were trying to help but the restaurant was uncooperative and would not believe there was mould on it! They kept saying the hummus was made fresh today, and even after Just Eat sent them the mould photos, they still would not accept their mistake. They wanted me to drop the food back to the restaurant so that they could take a look at it. They refused to come to my home to pick it up. I used the Just Eat food delivery app because I was unable to leave my home, so obviously I was not able to drop the food back to the restaurant either.

Conclusion: Just Eat refunded the full amount on behalf of the restaurant and they have great customer service. Nowshak on the other hand should be avoided at all costs, poor food quality and even worse customer service."}
{"text":"I got their falafel plate and samosas as take out around lunch time. The falafel was soft and tasty but not crisp on the outside. The rice was perfectly cooked and the spicy sauce brought the plate together. Then why the 2 stars? The samosas were packed in a separate box and the box was leaking oil onto the cover, the samosa were oily and looked like they spooned oil on it before closing the box. 
Probably will go again for take out but will check my food before i leave.

{"text":"One of the best kabob platter I have had in years.  They call it koobideh platter.  It's amazing.  Please try it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5-6 times in the last few years and the food is always great.  I've always been the only table in the place and sometimes have waited a while for service - like they were surprised to have customers!  Once I had to knock on the kitchen door and yell \"hello?\" Mantoo and Boulanee are great appies and be sure to get the Qabali rice side dish with your main.  Once they know you're there you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I would give this Afghan place a 4.5 stars on an overall bases.

First impression when getting in... small place with nice seating arrangements. Take a menu and once decided you will have to order and wait a bit for the food as its cooked fresh.

Food wise the price looked decent and I went with Double Kabob meals : Kabuli Kabob comes with Chicken & Chaplee. So you get 2 types of kabab with rice, and salad. The kababs were very nice and taste, and the food was fresh and hot. 

The service was good, there were enough seating and Parking.

For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat.

P.S. - There owner was nice enough to run out after us in the car as my friend had forgotten the phone on the table. We were literally driving by and he yelled to us. Good thing we didn't have to come back."}
{"text":"Noticed this place while driving through the plaza that surrounded Vaughan Mills. Checked out their website and decided to order some take out.  I had the COMBINATION PLATTER
Which consisted of either  One choice of koobideh/chaplee, then your choice of the second kabob Chaplee. This was my first time trying Afghan food, so I didn't know what to expect. In addiction to that, I had the Mantoo which were stuffed dumplings steamed with ground beef and onions on the inside. Overall the service was good, the food was tasty, but it also reminded me of middle eastern food. It was extremely quiet there with no customers when I went. I've gone there twice so far since its open but my concern is how long it will remain open due to the lack of demographics that are into this type of food."}
{"text":"It gets pretty QUIET in this Vaughan Mills Plaza for Sunday lunch and due to that fact, half of the restaurants in this strip do not open on Sunday.  I guess it's Nowshak's lucky day because I chose them for lunch and we were the only table in this contemporary setting with some exotic music.

This was our 2nd visit this Summer to an Afghani restaurant so we had a clue what we're looking at on the menu.  We skipped the Starters, Vegetarian, Kabob Platters directly to the SPECIAL Dishes.  We were still served with Afghani Flat Bread which was nice as we were starving.

My co-worker had the Tika Platter($9.49) where he choose Beef Tenderloin KABOB served with Salata, Yoghurt Sauce and Qabali.  

Qabali reminds me of Jewel Rice during my Persian dinner at Pomegranate.  Actually the whole dish reminds me of Persian food, I hope this doesn't offend anyone as it is just my ROOKIE comparison to this culture I'm still learning.  Please feel free to message me if I'm totally off track.

I got the Combination Platter($11.49) choice of Koobideh(Ground Beef) with any other Kabob which I got the Chopan(Lamb) served with Qabali and Salata.  The Qabali was YUMMY and large portion.  Chopan & Koobideh was good and so was the Salata where the hint of Coriander made the difference.

Our waitress did her work well and the setting is pretty comfy with nice CUSHY seats.  I believe this could be a nice date place for a night if you're bored of the Italian scene in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of specialties that are great to eat making you want to eat more, delicious food."}
{"text":"The food is not fresh. The meat doesn't taste good. I'm only giving 2 stars because I'm a nice guy. But they deserve 0."}
{"text":"Best mantoo, samosa (can be hit or miss with the beef) chakka (white sauce) great kabobs, not too crazy about the kofta but their chicken kabob and rice and bread is absolutely amazing, their salad is great and the service is great! Best mantoo ever"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was deserted. Someone quickly came in from the back to seat us. Since we had the whole restaurant to ourselves we got the seats of our choice.

We ordered the mantoo which had four steamed beef dumplings with a yogurt sauce. The server got us our drinks and appetizers quickly. The appetizer did not seem freshly made and tasted OK. It would have tasted better if it were hot. The sauce on top was pretty good.

I ordered the Vaziri kabob platter which came with koobideh and tandoori chicken. It took a while for them to get our main course. Being the only ones in the restaurant it felt quite long. At least we were assured that it would be freshly made. When the mains finally came out they looked delicious! The rice was topped with carrots and raisins. Everything tasted amazing. They were quite generous with the portions and there was enough food for another meal.

Overall the food was pretty good. The service however was a bit lacking in terms of the wait time for getting our entrees. There was a TV in the restaurant though which kept us entertained. The vibe is definitely more of a family restaurant than a date night kind of place."}
{"text":"Delicious Afghan food, and quick service!  I had the salad + chicken tandoori kabob and it was delicious."}
{"text":"A nice gem in this plaza, along with several others! I agree with the review below, in terms of this plaza not getting the amount of traffic or attention it deserves. It was my first time eating Afghan food and I was impressed by the friendly service and amazing flavours I came across. When we walked in, there wasn't anyone behind the counter so we weren't sure if they were ready for costumers. A man popped out from the back door to greet us and invited us to sit down anywhere, as they were still setting up for the day. Before taking our order, the same man from before explained to us some common spices used in Afghan cooking, along with what some of the menu items were. I ended up ordering the tikka platter: lamb, a salad, and long grain brown rice with raisins and carrots. It took some time to prepare our dishes,  and we were certain everything was prepared fresh. It came out as a huge portion of food, served with a side of spicy garlic sauce. All of it was sooo good, and the rice----YUM. I must say, when I first read about raisins and carrots on rice, I was skeptical, but it was an amazing combination of flavours, paired with the lamb and sauce. This place has undoubtedly made me a fan of Afghan cuisine! Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch. I actually found this place on Google and it said they were closed on Sunday so I called just to be sure and they were open! 

The food was delicious. Nothing I haven't tasted before, not bad, but there was no uniqueness to it. It was seasoned grilled meat with rice and salads. The food was good and satisfied me, but not memorable. 

When I arrived at the restaurant it was deserted. It was just me and the owner who was also in the middle of having his lunch. I wonder if they do not get business because of their inaccurate contact info on Google or for their lack of interest in their customers.
I say this because the whole time I was dining at this restaurant there was no employees to be seen to ensure I was comfortable and I had everything I needed. I could have dined and dashed and they wouldn't even know (Not that I would have done that) The server only came out from the back to take our order and bring our ordered dishes and then she would vanish :P We waited so long for the bill that we ended up just going to the front and asked for the bill, so we can leave."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza to the north of Vaughan Mills and as stated in the previous review this area doesn't get as much pedestrian traffic as it deserves.

We were the sole table at the time of our visit, which was on a Friday evening. A young girl greeted us as we entered and directed us to sit anywhere we would like. Even with a stroller to block the aisle didn't seem to bother her. Nor should it have unfortunately no one else entered the establishment while we were there. 

She didn't come right away to take our drink order, but rather waited ten minutes or so to take our full order. We had an appetizer which came out reasonably quick with the drinks as well, and shortly there after came the main course. 

Everything was absolutely delicious the portions were huge and the prices were very reasonable. I actually wasn't expecting so much food for the prices they were charging. I had the combination platter with tika and rice with carrots and raisins, it also comes with a salad with a yoghurt dressing. 

This was our first experience with Afghani cuisine and we were very impressed with the food here. The funny thing was that there was no music on and it was so quiet, until we were near done they decided to put on some music. It would have been a nice touch if they had it on when we got there. Other than that it was a nice experience with great food."}
{"text":"This place looks unsuspecting and empty from the outside. Walked in, waiter was not very talkative, ordered our food and wow! It was spectacular, fresh and great flavors, I would recommend you try this place and look beyond the facade."}
{"text":"It was the best afghani food I have ever had, everything was full of flavour, the meat was juicy and the rice was the delicious. Their spicy tomatoe sauce was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's usually fairly empty but I think it's because ppl don't know about it. By fast, the best Afghan in the GTA. They keep busy with lots of catering.

Try the naushak and mantoo dumplings- they're very hard to find in Toronto and these ones are the best I've had. 

Owner takes pride in his restaurant. Everyone I've brought here loves the place."}
