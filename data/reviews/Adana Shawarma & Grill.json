{"text":"The food was very tasty and very reasonably priced with good portions. The service was fast and friendly as well. For people looking for late night cheap eats (aside from fast food and diners), Adana has awesome hours. Would highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"It was disgusting.. the cook never uses gloves. The worst kebab it was.. never use washroom it was full of napkins and bunch of crap."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves all five stars! The staff are always so efficient, smiling and ready to help!

The decoration of this place is absolutely beautiful, gorgeous large photos of a couple of places in Turkey. Clean! Tables are always tidy and place is kept to 100%. 

Their food is seriously bomb! I have tried several dishes from there - Iskender Kebab, Adana Kebab platter - and I can tell you that the taste and fusion of flavors is absolutely divine! Their prices are great too - the average price for a platter is about $10 - $12 but their portions are large and filling! Salad is served as an appetizer. You are given a free lentil soup as an appetizer as well and after served fresh, hot Turkish tea as a token of gratitude. Definitely a place to visit if you are wanting to try some delicious Turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"Quality sucks. It was really good in the beginning, but changed the way how they make business"}
{"text":"I ordered combo 3. Good serving. Flavors are awesome. Server and cook was very nice. Will come back here when I visit Calgary again."}
{"text":"Was feeling adventurous one night and decided to give this place a try and I'm glad I did. 
We had the chicken shawarma and the Adana platter. 
I love that they toasted the wrap. It just makes it 10x  better. 
The flavours were great and portion was generous. 
The gentleman that was there (maybe the owner) was very friendly and accommodating. He offered us to try the Turkish tea, it was surprisingly good. Didn't have that typical herbal taste, it was very mild and smooth. As I hated drinking tea in general , this i wouldn't mind drinking again. 
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I really like that this place, named after a city in Turkey, has a menu with some surprises that we never see at other shawarma places in Calgary- and I mention shawarma because its full name is \"Adana Shawarma and Grill.\" I made my first visit there today and at the suggestion of some Turkish fellows I'd seen there before (on a visit when I just stepped in to check out the menu) called \"Iskendar Kabob,\" and I loved it. It comes with beef or chicken- lamb is trad per wikipedia but this was what was on offer- and I had beef.  They put a few bite-size pieces of a fairly thick pita (think a Greek pita, not Lebanese, not Turkish pide either), poured some mild tomato sauce and a little melted butter on there, then added a pile of beef from the spit. They serve it with very good long grain rice on one side of the plate at Adana, and the other has magnificent thick yogurt, like labneh (discovered last visit it's a mixture of Greek yogurt and sour cream- it WORKS!). It was very good, very rich and filling if a bit pricey by shawarma shop standards at $12.99, but it's delicious and very nicely plated, real porcelain and metal utensils. I got a free treat from their pastry counter too- not tired baklawa but a chewy confection I'd not had before."}
{"text":"Good, clean, friendly, accommodating, and professional. Not to mention an interesting menu based on the geographic cross roads of its owners. I have tried their Chicken Shawarma, Iskandar Kabab, and the royal Pilaf ( Rice pie ) ... as you can tell , I have already been back."}
{"text":"An excellent place to go for donairs, wraps, shawarma.  The people are very friendly and accommodating to dietary & health constraints.  What sets Adana apart is their attention to detail and customer service.  I felt like I was being treated like a valued customer rather than someone looking for a fast-food meal.  Their restaurant is new, well organized and decorated with a theme.  Their counters are all clean and their tables aren't falling apart of covered in grease (like most places that sell this type of food).

Another great thing about Adana is their prices are slightly lower than most places in their category.  Since I live only a block away I will definately be a regular there!"}
