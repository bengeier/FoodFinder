{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday, and loved my food.
I ordered the Veggie stromboli (fresh veggies- they weren't slimy, thank goodness!), my cousin ordered the Meat stromboli, and we both loved them. If I lived in Cleveland, I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"got birthday snacks for my classroom celebration here every grade 1-11! gotta love the family owned place in the heart of clveland's little italy!"}
{"text":"Sausage and spinach Stromboli is simply perfect. Make sure you get a side of sauce. The sauce reminds me of my great grandfathers, it is very classic and delicious. The sfogliatelle is also amazing. Eggplant parm, chicken parm, etc etc. They get everything right here. The only downside is the price, and sometimes rude employees.  It seems like some of them feel like they know they have you coming back for the food so they don't even bother trying to be kind to you."}
{"text":"I went in there for a cup of coffee and found a variety of desserts that looked really appetizing. However, since it was the morning and I wanted something to go with the coffee, I chose a breakfast croissant sandwich and it was the best I feel like I've had in a long time! The croissant wasn't too crisp or dry like other croissants I've had and the sauteed bell peppers/onions on top of provolone cheese + egg was something I've never thought of doing before. I was really glad I went and I hope I can find some time to go back and try the desserts!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I still prefer cannoli from Mike's Pastry in Boston, but these were very, very good (all the pastries we tasted were amazing). We had pasta, pizza, and stromboli for lunch and all were amazing (very good, fresh, homemade sauce on the side for the stromboli, YUM!). The coffee (I had cafe au lait) was also delicious. And as far as cost, I can't even believe anyone thinks it is high-- we were shocked at how inexpensive it was ($1.50 for a slice of cheese pizza?  Really?!?!). On a long road trip, this was one of the most inexpensive lunches we had and my teen boys had TWO main dishes each and dessert... and the portion sizes are completely reasonable, I think they were just thrilled to finally have some good food. Yes, there was a little bit of a wait, but the \"grab a number\" system works just fine and it still is quicker than most sit-down restaurants. Seriously good - I wish we lived closer!!"}
{"text":"A classic example of a great Italian bakery that happens to serve very good food too. We stopped by for lunch and it was busy - always a good sign! I got the Italian sandwich which was terrific. Super fresh roll made it delicious. Came with a tremendous homemade coleslaw. Other members of our party had chicken parm sandwich (\"good not great\"), meatball sandwich, chicken salad and pesto tortalini. Chocolate cannoli was also really good. Very reasonably priced, with drinks came to around $34."}
{"text":"Presti's is great for lunch during the week or on the weekend.   Their pizzas are what I remember from my childhood, just like grandma's!  It is impossible for me to leave without a loaf of their fresh baked bread and cookies.  The kids have the biggest smiles when they see the box.

You need patients if you are planning to eat at the traditional 12:00 lunch hour.  If you are flexible on the time I suggest a half hour on either side to make the process quicker."}
{"text":"This is the cat's pajamas. If you're looking for some good desserts, go to Presti's. I come here after I get dinner in Little Italy with some friends. There is nothing better I think - at least in the Cleveland area. They have a wide variety of just desserts for you to choose from - my favorite is the cannoli. They also serve dinner/lunch foods such as pizza, pasta, gelato, espresso...But i come here mostly for deserts. Go try it - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"After a great dinner nothing is like a freshly baked pastry and a hot cappuccino with whipped cream.
They have so many freshly baked pastries it is hard to pick, I recommend the chocolate-covered cannolis."}
{"text":"You walk in, and the atmosphere is calm and sweet.  There are a couple of college students hard at work over some coffee and half eaten pastries, two older women with sandwiches enjoying the other's company in the corner, and a man with mustache enjoying a novel while his latte grows cold.  You're facing a case that is full of every Italian confection your heart longs for, dainty little butter cookies, ladylocks, and ohmygoodnessthetiramisu!  Everything is as delicious as it looks which is a rare feat for a bakery.  The bread is good.  The service is great.  If you are in the area, near university circle--come to Presti's.  Support the family business, and enjoy some top knotch bakery."}
{"text":"Presti's reminds me of a glorified cafeteria. There is little to no ambiance...so much can be done with the place in terms of making it comfortable. At the same time that may be why it is so uncomfortable...for a higher turnover. The placed was jam packed when we were there and lucky to get a table. The pastries were good while the coffee was somewhat weak. This is the only coffee shop type place in Little Italy thus this write up is relative to this fact. 

Oh. Parking is TERRIBLE in the area....good luck!"}
{"text":"Problem is that they use \"take a number\" system, then let locals cut in line. I waited my turn for 3o minutes while people were allowed to cut. Cavatelli was so so at best."}
{"text":"Presti's has an outstanding selection of food and beverages for a small shop. The interior is bright, clean, and spacious when not packed with enthusiastic patrons. I didn't get an overly friendly vibe from the establishment, but that could just be due to location and/or the cold and rainy day."}
{"text":"Okay for the price but the spinach bread didn't taste fresh. The guy with the beard was a little rude, he laughed at the allergen question i had and without looking into it said that eggplant parm doesn't contain eggs. When I asked him to please double check, it ended up having eggs. The two stars are for the price and the location."}
{"text":"Love this little bakery in Little Italy! Excellent cannoli, tiramisu, and the Italian cookies are to die for! Made a great birthday present when visiting family, this is my go to for baked goods now. Definitely grab a number if there's a line, you'll need it."}
{"text":"Best pizza evaaaaa!!! The only place that can make delicious cold pizza. Presti's is one of the great things about Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I went there with my sister on a Saturday about 2pm and we waited in line for several minutes, i'll estimate 10-15.  We took this time to look over the displays of food and make up our mind what to get -- as we had never been there for lunch before-- so it wasn't too bad waiting that one time.  however I would hate to wait that long every time I go and so I don't intend to go on a Saturday or a busy time again because that's just too long to wait.  especially when very hungry and people continually jostle you as they come in and out the door (yes the line does go out the door) Got a breakfast croissant that they warmed up for me and my sister got the signature panini of the day they were good nothing amazing"}
{"text":"Friend recommended it for lunch. Place packed, obviously lots of regulars. Much more than a bakery, lots of great looking food on display, sorry I only could try one, the stromboli which I never had before. Will be back."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on my experience with a worker named Maura.

I am a frequent out-of-state visitor to Cleveland, and I always make a point to stop by Prestis.  What a mistake yesterday!

I had the unfortunate and unpleasant experience of being waited on by Maura.  What a poor example of customer service!  I was trying to give her two cannoli orders - one two chocolate and two regular and one order of one chocolate and one regular.  When I tried to give her both orders, she only let me give her one at a time because she \"might forget.\"  A young girl should not have difficulty in remembering something as simple as this.  Then, she brought back the first order of 4 cannolis, which were to be a gift to someone, all crammed in to a small plastic box when all the other servers were placing them nicely in Prestis boxes.  (trust me, I know this because I had to wait 30 minutes in line in a hot, crowded building).  When I asked for a cardboard box, she rolled her eyes and then made fun with another worker.  Laugh laugh laugh. 

After this she decides that she has to write down my order and every time she got one more thing she had to ring it up on the cash register.  What should have been a 5 minute order took 15 minutes at least.  

At the end of the order she put the receipt on top of the counter and walked away.  I signed it, took my copy, and started to leave until I was accosted by Maura about where was the receipt.  I said I had left it on top of the counter.  \"Well, it's not there.\"  Perhaps if she would have paid attention instead of walking away she would be more on top of these things.  It is not a customer's job to make sure she has her receipts.  While I was bagging up my items she said something again about the receipt and once again I said I did not have it, to which she responded \"It was only a question.\"  

Other things went on with this person that does not show Presti's in a positive light.  She was snarky and rude and would be fired in a second if she were my employee!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from NYC where we have great Canollis, so I was excited to try this one after reading reviews. I was VERY disappointed. The shell was fine but the cream was very lackluster. It tasted as if it was missing sugar. I didn't even bother finishing it, as it wasn't worth the calories.

However, I will say the tiramisu was delightful. Light and sweet and one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland with my daughter.  We had walked into the neighborhood and decided to stop for lunch.  The cuban panini was good, but when we were getting ready to leave we picked up a few bakery items to take for the ride home.  What a wonderful surprise!  The pastries were excellent. These may be some of the best we've had.  Only wish we had gotten a couple of lbs of cookies instead of just the one & that we had grabbed a few cannoli's.  It was a great ride home with some wonderful pastries and cookies. A definite stop if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"OMG. You should try today's panini. It is soso delicious. Stromboni is also good.    Panini is the best!! For dessert try Canoli and tiramisu."}
{"text":"All of their cookies are great but I can't pass up the pignoli cookies. The live music was a nice touch. It really added to the \"Little Italy\" experience."}
{"text":"A huge range of Italian breads and baked goods, including the best canolli west of NYC.  Incredibly busy when I was there Sunday lunch time."}
{"text":"This place was great! My husband and I split the meatball sub with chips and picked out several dessert options. The place wasn't busy when we first got there so pulling a number tab wasn't necessary, but within 5 minutes after ordering the place was packed! They have an adequate amount of seating between the inside and outside. If we end up going back (we live in Louisville, KY and stopped here on a road trip) and order the meatball sub again, I will ask for an additional cup of tomato sauce, it was incredible and would be very tasty on the kettle chips served with the sub. Great spot and I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"a very laid back place for hanging out or catching up with friends. today we had eggs and cheese croissant and coffee for breakfast. i saved some room for a slice of tiramisu which is really good- not too sweet- perfect for my taste!:) my friend got the custard cream puff- i didn't get to ask her how it was but since it was gone before i even noticed- i think it was good too!:)"}
{"text":"I finally found something good to est today in Little Italy, a chocolate canoli with a double expresso. The shell was crispy and dipped in chocolate.  The filling was creamy and not overly sweet.  The expresso cut the sweetness nicely.  I sat outside and enjoyed the summer night with my dolce."}
{"text":"Good coffee and pastry. It's always busy, too busy."}
{"text":"The most delicious cassata cake I've ever had! All the pastries are delicious, I bought many bakery items and was extremely surprised at the total cost, very reasonable for how fresh and delicious it was. And the portions sizes were well above average. Definitely going back for more cassata, all I can say is you won't be disappointed! The place was packed, everyone friendly as we all eagerly waited for our number to be called! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a quick snack in Cleveland. I visit about twice a month. It is located in the Little Italy neighborhood, where parking is very tight during the weekend. Presti's is always crowded, but I don't care about that, because I'm use to crowds. The entrees are good, they are well prepared and fill me up quickly. But I am here to talk about the desserts. Their gelato is good to get on a hot day, and it is pricey for the portion, but the taste and creaminess make up for that. The tiramisu is THE BEST you will ever get in the Midwest region. It pairs well with their coffee or a glass of milk. The Canolis' are awesome. The dough and powdered sugar with the cream cheese will be very tempting. If you want an upgrade, get the chocolate-covered canoli. There are so many desserts I just can't review them all. I'll be getting something new every time I go there. I would highly recommend this bakery to anybody looking for a place to get a quick bit in the Cleveland area. P.S. Eat outside if possible. Cleveland has beautiful weather during the summer, despite it raining every week."}
{"text":"I ordered a red velvet cake from here for a birthday party. Everyone was impressed. I loved the frosting and the cream cheese filling. It was def the best I've ever had! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had the cannoli and a coffee, enjoyed it very much at a great price. Selection is great, but I felt a bit rushed as the line moved quickly...lots to choose from! The setting is great in Little Italy, especially on a Sunday morning. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town to have a more in-depth look."}
{"text":"I have to admit - I've eaten Presti's wonderful delights for years thanks to my mom working downtown, but had never stepped foot inside the bakery in my almost 28 years.  That is, until now.  Having a girl's day with my mom, her friend, and my boyfriend's mom we figured Little Italy would be a fantastic way to top off an afternoon spent at the theatre (we saw Mama Mia, if you were wondering).  After a filling lunch of pasta, bread, and salad (hey, we had to justify the pasta eating somehow!) we strolled down the street to Presti's to, what else, stuff our face with amazing Italian desserts.  

After taking in the contemporary style of their cafe, I immediately made my way over to the gelato bar.  Pistachio and hazelnut for me this time, but there are plenty of delicious flavors to satisfy your watering mouth.  I have no idea what the ladies of my group ordered because I was too busy trying to eat my gelato without it melting on my fab new jumpsuit, but whatever they got also looked amazing.  

And just so my boyfriend didn't feel left out of the dessert stop - and mainly because i'm such a great girlfriend ;) - I snagged a lemon square and mini fruit cheesecake to go and I will definitely be doing the same the next time I'm at Presti's.  

So leave your calorie counting at home if you're planning to make a stop because it won't matter the instant you see these yummy pastries!"}
{"text":"Do not order the pizza. If your idea of pizza us bread with cheese and sauce of it, then you might enjoy it.  I has the pepperoni sausage. It had one piece of sausage. In my opinion, if you want pizza, you would be better to get one from 711 or a frozen one from the grocery store.

However, the desserts look fabulous. It did not try any.

If you want coffee/esoresso and a biscotti or other dessert then this is probably a great place."}
{"text":"Presti's is a bakery with a lot of lunch options. They do a decent job of trying to get the crowds through, but It's still a bit hectic with the 'take a number' system. I suppose that's the authentic italian part. Both the food and pastries alright: sometimes a little bland, and sometimes very good. My favorite thing to get is the meat stromboli."}
{"text":"Lived in Cleveland Heights for 5 years (1987-1992) - Presti's was a place to go for donuts and other goodies. During wife's pregnancy I found myself at Presti's at odd hours (3 AM cravings! for half a glazed donut!) and even at that ungodly hour I was never alone :-). From 1992 I had to drive from far side of Mayfield RD for our donut fix. great bread too."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly and accommodating. They went above and beyond to help me to buy a cake for my son's birthday. I don't live in Cleveland (any more) and they really went out of their way to help me to make my son's day special. Oh, yeah - it also tasted just delicious (I hear)."}
{"text":"Presti's is a great place in Little Italy to stop in a grab lunch and or a treat of one of their many baked goods. It's on the west end of Little Italy in a really nice, open space. It has nice big windows and a high ceiling. You order at the counter and seat yourself. For the size of the space, there is a decent amount of tables. I stopped in for lunch and had the sun dried tomato tortellini. It was excellent. I savored every bite of it. For a dessert, I had a Napoleon. It too was really good. Everything in the display case looked really good though. The lunch menu was pretty decent, but the pastas looked the best. Overall, if you're looking for a quick, casual place to eat in Little Italy, head over to Presti's."}
{"text":"Excellent parties and desserts. The chocolate mouse cake is wonderful.  Service is always pleasant and as fast as is possible given its always very busy."}
{"text":"Presti's is a good choice as a coffee shop to sit and do homework or meet a friend, or for a quick lunch or dinner. Some of the pastries are better than others. I think my favorite is the cannoli. I have a friend who claims that the chocolate chip cookie here is one of the best in the world (I disagree. I think the chocolate chip cookie here is fine but nothing special). I've had enough good experiences with pastry here that I want to try more of the options. 
I like the stromboli and the pizza. The sausage and spinach stromboli or the vegetable stromboli will make a nice, cheap takeout meal. 
Another cool thing about Presti's is the energy. It does get crowded and there can be a long line to order. People really use and enjoy Presti's.
I do have one significant beef with Presti's and that is that they do not allow samples of the gelato. I get that when they're busy it's probably inconvenient to have somebody waffling over what flavor to get, but trying ones ice cream before committing is a time honored tradition that should be allowed, at least when there isn't a line out the door."}
{"text":"Presti's is a pretty good bakery with many meal choices as well as baked goods (sandwiches, salads, pizzas, soup) - I especially like the ganache and other cookies to keep me happy while I study. The small cheesecakes are tasty as well, and there are a few options. It gets busy weekend evenings but is generally well worth the wait. I feel like there could be more options but I am fairly happy with the choices here."}
{"text":"Loved it. Just happened to stumble upon it and thought it was fantastic. They use a number system instead of waiting in a line - I think this is great because they day I was there was super crowded and having a number meant that I could walk around and decide what I wanted before I ordered which I think made it a lot more efficient. Loved the authentic Italian ice and gelato (the peanut butter was to die for). I also have a few other goodies I took home with me that I haven't tried yet but look amazing. This is definitely a must repeat on my next trip to cleveland."}
{"text":"The best Cassata cake anywhere!!! Good thing I live about an hour away if not I'll be so fat."}
{"text":"I came in for a cannoli but when I saw all of the choices, I opted for raspberry mousse. So light and airy. I also bought an iced coffee. It's a busy place. Make sure you grab a number as soon as you walk in and start making your decision so you can keep things moving."}
{"text":"Great bakery in the heart of Little Italy. Been twice and fast, great service no matter how busy they are. The chicken parm sandwich was as big as my forearm and delicious! Cannolis are must get and the tiramisu is fantastic. Get a box of a pastries to go so you can enjoy the charm of this great cafe from your home."}
{"text":"If you visit Little Italy in Cleveland you have to go to Presti's.  They recently remodeled into a bigger, nicer  space.  I like the gelato and pastries.  If want  a good canoli walk up the street 500 ft to Corbo's, but for everything else baked stay with Presti\"s.  

According to my parents, who went to school at Case Western in the early 80's, Presti's used to have the BEST donuts made fresh every night.  They don't make them anymore, but I have heard they are thinking about starting again due to popular demand."}
{"text":"Crazy busy! 

The \"take-a-number\" system seemed to create chaos and confusion with both the employees and the customers. In a busy and noisy bakery, it can be hard to hear them call out the numbers as they flip the counter. And the employees often seemed to not know how many numbers had been pulled and would guess how far to advance the counter. Beyond the little snags with running out of tickets in the machine the confusion at the counter, Presti's is a great bakery.

The cannolis are out of this world and rival the ones I had in NYC. The cannoli shell was crisp and the filling was smooth and creamy with mini chocolate chips. On the other hand, the hot apple cider wasn't nearly hot enough and lacked the fullness that I expect from spiced beverages: nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice."}
{"text":"Good bakery with a vast selection of food, desserts, and gelato. Good cannoli and great tiramisu! Slightly proxy but still good."}
{"text":"If you're the mood for good, quick, cheap coffee, the perfect presto cup awaits you at Presti's.

Little Italy's mouthwatering bakery happens to serve the best buck-twenty-five brew around town. The magical Joe is also known as the \"Gourmet Blend,\" roasted by Cleveland's Van Roy Coffee Co. Referred to as their \"masterpiece,\" the flavor profile features three distinct beans, each roasted at different spectrums before blended into a full-bodied, smooth and complex finish.

The Gourmet Blend certainly doesn't sacrifice quality; rather, it delivers a decadent flavor that's mildly bold with a slight tangy aftertaste. Need a little sweetness? Pair the brew with a dense peanut butter brownie ($3) or a slice of carrot cake ($4). For a lighter option, treat yourself to a chocolate espresso biscotti or a fudge brownie cookie ($12.50 per pound)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast and picked up some cookies for later. Breakfast croissants were good and the cookies were delicious."}
{"text":"It's clean and nice, but the pastries aren't very good tbh.. There are way better bakeries in LA, Boston, NYC, etc but I sometimes go here since there aren't many other bakeries around.. Everything here is very sweet- they have lots of small cookie snacks and a couple small tartlets/cakes. Its pretty overpriced if I compare it to all the other amazing bakeries I've been to."}
{"text":"Raspberry linzers,  pecan cin roll mmmm...great food! Amazinggg Margarita pizza wow! Deluxe pizza (middle piece) Jesus God. My fave place. Mmmm cookies, mmmm coffee. I'm dying right now thinking about it."}
{"text":"Asked the guy for 2 cappucino and 1 macchiattoooo!!! All served in cappuccino cups!!!  He started heating the milk and got it to the point to burning the milk/foam as it was whistling continuosly. Then he started filling the cups with a spoon. Woot!!! Please!!! U are italian bar not MCcaffe!!!  Staff was unorganized and scattered everywhere. Its used to be great place but 90% empty tables at and a crowded line at the cash register is not good.Dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place but it can get busy. We go here for the DONUTS. They are so delish! Took a star off because your staff needs to learn how to make a proper cappuccino. Foam peaks and foam spilling onto the side of cup is not good..."}
{"text":"Une excellente boulangerie Italienne dans ce petit quartier italien très serré de Cleveland. Cette boulangerie et pâtisserie propose aussi des sandwichs dans un décor sobre et aéré. C'est aussi le lieu idéal pour une pause café dans ce quartier et pour emporter des petits cookies à la pêche et des biscotti pour la route."}
{"text":"Presti's is one of my favorite places in Cleveland! I went here all the time when I lived in little Italy. They have a huge variety of pastries ranging from m&ms cookies to fancy miniature cheesecakes. They also serve a variety of lunch type foods, like sandwiches, stromboli and pizza by the slice. OH, and of course there's the gelato! So yummy! There really is something for everyone here. Word of warning though, they are usually quite busy! Make sure to take a number before looking at all those pastries. :)"}
{"text":"Great Stromboli, coffee is good but not great. Cookies are also good but not great. I gotta try the tiramisu some day, I was told."}
{"text":"I LOVE Presti's. My favorite spot in Little Italy. Everything is always fresh, the service is fast and the workers are very friendly!"}
{"text":"The cannoli here is the best I've ever had, and their other pastries and baked goods are excellent as well. I'm not a coffee drinker, but my wife loved the latte she had here too."}
{"text":"I think most of the people reviewing Presti's are getting it confused with Gilly's up the street.  This Presti's is NOT a late night/early morning donut shop; Gilly's is.  Gilly's used to be called Presti's but has since been sold and renamed.

THIS Presti's does have donuts, along with all kinds of sweets, gilato, pizza, sandwiches and espresso.  They are best known for their Italian bread that many restaurants in the area use.  The bread is good, the sweets are good, the sandwiches are OK, the espresso is OK (I'm being forgiving because Cleveland doesn't have many good espresso shops).  Don't ask to get the pizza reheated, they just zap it in the microwave.  You're better off bring it home and putting in a 400 degree oven.  For sandwiches and subs I think Anthony's across the street is a better choice, but when the weather is nice some coffee and a snack is quite pleasurable at Presti's tables on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"It's so obvious that my past two 5-star reviews are from my life before children.  Stopped in here for lunch recently with my two tots and had to deal with a messy, urgent diaper change on the tiny, disgusting floor of their unisex bathroom.  As much as I have enjoyed this place in the past, I probably won't be returning for at least 3 years when I can be assured I won't need to experience that trauma again."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries and cappuccino. Had the cannoli, creme brule, and a macaroon. All tasty. Long wait to place an order because it was very busy. Corbos - a block away - is also excellent with no wait."}
{"text":"On this most recent trip I ordered a chocolate dipped coconut macaroon, a handful of Pignoli cookies (my absolute favorite cookie), a cinnamon bun and a handful of thumbprint raspberry cookies. 

This place seems yo have it all! They have savory items that you can eat for lunch and dinner and they have all the delicious pastries/cookies you can think of as well as a well sized selection of gelatos and even an espresso machine to make your favorite coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Presti's is awesome! I live essentially right next door to the place and love to get cannolis and cafe au laits when I just want to relax and catch up with a friend. I don't get to see one of my friends much, but when I do, we ALWAYS go to Presti's.

At times, we get overwhelmed with the crowd there, but we never fail to see cute babies and indulge in some fantastic desserts! The stromboli is amazing as well!

The convenience is also incredibly appreciated, as there was once a wine filled evening when we all wanted some cookies. Luckily, they're not only convenient, but delicious too!"}
{"text":"I go there a lot but lately I've been really getting bad I went there and got cookies today the cookies were so hard old nasty I couldn't believe it next time I go I will let them know now I'm glad I didn't buy what I was going to buy"}
{"text":"Drunken Clevelanders emerging from parties and bars all over the east side find themselves following their noses to Presti's bakery in Little Italy at 2 and 3 am.  They're following the sweet warm vapors emitted by the making of fresh donuts.  Like Bob's on Polk in San Francisco, these donuts are evil in their ability to lure you out of a warm car on the snowiest rainiest windiest night in a dark North Coast winter to tromp through the icy drifts toward sweet glazed nirvana in the form of a hot donut."}
{"text":"Very racist if your black do not go here ! My number was called and I was skipped numerous time they had genuine courtesy for the Caucasian people but when I was skipped I was told to take another number. I tried to explain the guy cut me off in mid conversation and called the next number."}
{"text":"Presti's Bakery is one of those places where you can go and get authentic ethnic food at reasonable prices. Italian food is available everywhere, you can find pizza in any food court all over the country but by authentic, I mean how the Italians eat in Italy. I should clarify that I have never been to Italy but I can tell when I see the real ingredients rather than canned and processed ingredients on the food. 

The other very good thing about this place is a location. It is in a very nice place on the corner, so it has more than one wall with glass windows, means more light. Very basic seating arrangement makes it elegant. In the summertime there are chairs and tables outside where you can seat and enjoy your meal. 

I ordered Pizza margarita, which is my favorite specialty pizza. I loved it. I am going to be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Great selection on cookies and baked goods.  They have tons of cookies and a lot of selection of drinks plus ice creams. Big and small tables for all size of groups."}
{"text":"World class.  It topped off our side-trip to Cleveland's Little Italy.  Coffee is excellent.  Parking is tight in the general area.  We were there for dinner, so we did a valet.  I would Uber."}
{"text":"Take a number!  This place can be a zoo.  Peruse the case, wait for your number to be called, pick out your goodies, and sit down to mangia.  The anise cookies are great.  Tiramisu is good but I think Gallucci's has a more authentic and less sweet version.  Latte was okay.  But then again, this is a food place, not a coffee place.  Cream puffs are always delicious, too."}
{"text":"I wish this bakery was in Michigan! I go here every time I am in town. The creme brule is amazing.  The fudge brownie cookie is also one of my favorites. The food in their cafe along with their drinks are also great. I look forward to my trips to Cleveland just to go here."}
{"text":"Hands down Best Bakery in Cleveland!!!  My absolute favorite is their peanut butter brownies. They are like crack!!!!  Rich creamy and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I don't see the hype honestly. Maybe is was just my particular order (Chicken Parm), but the meal was extremely basic and the taste did not match the price. I also felt that this place isn't very clear (as someone unfamiliar with this establishment), where you need to go to order once you walk in. I was told I needed to get a ticket by another customer, and it took me a while to actual find the ticket dispenser... and then I was unsure if I needed to wait in the line they were in, or a separate one. 

Well, anyways, the girl who helped me out was extremely friendly and got my food ready fairly quickly. She also assisted me in telling me where there was an outlet to temporarily charge my phone while I ate. 

I was visiting Cleveland for the first time and definitely screwed up coming here and ordering the Chicken Parm. I definitely think I should have gotten something else... this place seems popular and was packed every time I passed it!"}
{"text":"Presti family, you ROCK! This bakery is fantastic. So happy to have found you on our visit to Case Western. The service is friendly and helpful. But the best thing is the custard puff. OMG, this deal is the real thing. So crispy and flaky on the outside and sweet and delicious on the inside. Not only that, my picky hubby requested a crazy espresso drink, and they were happy to follow his wishes. Being here since 1903, I wish you many more generations to come. That way, I can keep eating those custard puffs!!"}
{"text":"Great little bakery. This place was slam packed when we went by and I think we had number 70 when they were just calling 35. It was worth the wait though. They have a huge selection of home made pastries and we did a family style sampler platter of cakes, tiramisu and some other treats. The cannoli was delicious as well. Hard to find a really tasty cannoli imo. Would like to check this place out again if I get the chance."}
{"text":"I have been to this bakery ranging from times when it was very busy to when it was not busy at all. Regardless of the unpredicted chaos, the staff was always courteous. 

In terms of the bakery items, there was nothing there that really knocked my socks. I did try different bakery items around the country so I don't know if i happen to compare the different items unfairly. However, this is still a go to place for most people in the area especially the students. This place is a walkable distance from the University Circle, and the items are very reasonably priced. This place also has lunch items (which I personally did not try) and has a very large seating area."}
{"text":"Bakery and friendliness are number one.

I came in after a long day off walking and found that it was a street fare in little Italy. My knee was hurting so I went inside to sit and the staff took great care of me. 
Though the street fare was keeping them busy they made a point of making sure I was treated well. I very much appreciate it. 

There was zero pressure for tips but I did so out of thanks. 

As for food, it's clearly a bakery first and where they shine. Tiramisu was well done as was the chocolate cannoli (sp?) I brought home for later. 

I found the friendly atmosphere and very helpful staff to be the most important part of the bakery. That gets me every time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Husband loved the chocolate cannoli, I was a fan triple chocolate cheesecake and my sister enjoyed the Chocolate Mousse."}
{"text":"Presti's is a cool option in Little Italy. For breakfast, they do have some sandwiches they warm, but expect more pastry-like choices. I've never tried one but they look delicious. They have a nice gelato selection - and the pastry counter is ginormous. It's a good option for lunch if you're in the area - everything from salads to pasta dishes to sandwiches and soups. The wait can be a bit long though. Mostly I come here to meet friends for coffee. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Large italian bakery cleveland little italy
Went on a Sunday 1130 am..busy as you would expect... but within 5 minutes got my coffee and tiramisu... great choice for  brunch!  Yum very good plenty of seating ....
Great choice for a destination on a Sunday morning
I'm sure there are times when lines are out the door? Maybe particularly when it isn't winter and cold!
Recommend!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for a good dessert and going the old school way by pulling a number and waiting to be called. My favorite here is the Cassata Cake, but we also had the tiramisu and it was really good. The best part of the cassata cake is the fresh strawberries and light whipped cream.

There is a ton of food to choose from as well, but I haven't actually made it here for lunch or dinner. I have to say though everything smelled so good."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!! Well okay I haven't actually EATEN there, but my boyfriend picked up a slice of pumpkin cheesecake and double chocolate cheesecake from Presti's for my birthday. It was FANTASTIC! Especially the pumpkin. I made him go back and get another slice of pumpkin the following weekend! Probably some of the best cheesecake I've had in my life. And I've had a lot of cheesecake..."}
{"text":"I love the turtle cookies so much that I buy them every time I come across the street."}
{"text":"Great gelato, great coffee, and great pastries/desserts to indulge in as you come here before and after your meal in Little Italy.  I think it's probably best after a good meal in any of the many restaurants surrounding the bakery.  The place is wide open and can easily get busy, especially as the weekend nears when we all have time to experience life outside of work.  If you're in the area, come here get your italian sweet fix....you won't be diappointed."}
{"text":"I've never had an authentic canoli before and it was yummy! My group and I had eaten at Trattoria for dinner and strolled down the streets of little Italy for something sweet. The Italian cookies were good, nothing too special, but the Gelato and the Canoli's were just what the doctor ordered! I was already stuffed from Trattoria, but I got a canoli, took 2 bites and brought it back to my hotel for after our nightly bar trip- perfect! I would highly recommend this place to daters out there as the late-night ambiance was quite beautiful, too bad the high school kids that worked there weren't a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in this Sunday morning to pick up breakfast to go. Despite what other reviews suggest, the line was quite short and my food was served promptly. The pastry options were beautiful and extensive, but I chose to go with a croissant egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino. 

Let me tell you. I think I made the right choice. The sandwich was buttery, flaky, and hearty without being greasy, which is truly an art. A simple delight. And the cappuccino was fabulous, and topped with cinnamon and cocoa. Next time, I'll definitely have the cappuccino at the restaurant, as I think it would have been even better piping hot. 

It's Little Italy in Cleveland, so parking is a challenge, but Presti's is well worth a few drives around the block."}
{"text":"Presit's has an excellent feel and ambiance to it...I love the wall-to-wall window scape of Mayfield road and the options from Cold Pizza to taste bud infused Gelato. The lines can be long, but it's worth the wait and also the chocolate chip cannoli is great for a take home to mom. One little thing they do...they have free water in a lemonade machine for hot summer days and those who need to flush down their sweet tooth. A must go to if your in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I love this spot! My personal faves are the cheesecake, apricot linzers, and stromboli.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The cookies are delicious and you will be very tempted to eat a lb of cookies for lunch.   I had a chicken sandwich and it was very good.   The staff is very nice.  The meal is also not expensive.   The fig cookie was very good.  I was glad that I had lunch there.    It's a nice location close to the campus."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot. Coffee is right on. Favorite place for pastry dishes as well. Get there early and sit outside"}
{"text":"I love Presti's. I've only been a couple times but I'm constantly wanting to go/thinking about going. The veggie stromboli is out of this world, and I can only imagine that the meat varieties are fantastic too. The eggplant parm is pretty average and I wouldn't get it again. But the pizza is great. As is the apple tart. Add to this mouth-watering range of sweet and savory options a warm, cozy, and bustling atmosphere, and you've got yourself a winning eat-in bakery. I can't wait to make many more brunch/snack stops here."}
{"text":"Okay, I still love this place, but I have some new input that I think is worth sharing: 

Desserts here are still awesome, I think. Not really cheap but totally worth it. Really great variety and they never seem to be out of what I want. I have never been let down by the sweets. 

However, kind of meh when it comes to dinner. I had gotten veggie stromboli in the past but they were out when I went this weekend.. They were also out of basically everything else that I wanted (Friday around 6 pm so I kind of get it but was still disappointed). Ended up getting veggie pizza. They warmed it up but gave it to me basically still cold. Also got a side salad that was pretty whatever. 

Basically - go somewhere else for dinner. Maybe grab lunch there but I was just unhappy that I picked Presti's for dinner. Come by for sweets after dinner, though!"}
{"text":"I used to work in Cleveland and every Wednesday was Doughnut Day... the company would spring for doughnuts for all the employees, and would buy the doughnuts ONLY from Presti's.  Let me tell you that I have never had a doughnut so delicious... I have become utterly spoiled and cannot possibly eat a doughnut from Dunkin or Krispy Kreme, they are just awful when compared!
I haven't tried anything of their's other than the doughnuts, but if the doughnuts are this damn good, the rest must be great as well!"}
{"text":"Drove over an hour to get here. Parking was a bit rough on a Sunday morning. It was quite busy when we first arrived.. I felt a bit lost being a first timer. Apparently you have to pull a number and they will help you. It will be good to know what exactly what you want bc when they call your number you will feel extremely rush. the first lady wasn't very helpful at answering any questions I had regarding to the bake goods. Then a second girl took over my order bc I guess I asked too many questions lol. The cashier computer system was down so it was so hectic. The food was mediocre. If you live around the area it's a good place to spend your morning but it's definitely not worth an hr drive. Not even a 15 mins drive considering how bad parking is. The food or bake good isn't worth the hassle that's for sure."}
{"text":"Don't leave without trying the Bucaletti fig cookies. It is a shortbread filled with fig, chocolate, and nuts. Everything is good here."}
{"text":"This is the only bakery I'm aware of that serves such delicious italian pastries. There are at least 20 different varieties of small cookies and pastries to choose from, and each have their own unique textures and tastes. In addition, they have hot and cold foods on  one side of the restaurant - stromboli, pizza, pastas, sandwiches etc. It does get busy though, so don't forget to grab a number at the front!"}
{"text":"Lots of great sweets options! Latte was great as well. They have gelato, but I've never tried it. They have food options for a very reasonable price. I love to go here for their tiramisu cake and cannolis!! 

My friend came to visit me from out of town and I took her to Prestis and a man in front of us paid for our order!! Too sweet. Great place to study, go on dates, nom on sweets and food, and people watch. Love to go here all the time."}
{"text":"Presti's- a place I've visited 3 times already during my first week in Cleveland. I've tried their sweets; the lemon biscotti is amazing! And tiramisu. And there's so many amazing looking options that you can really have whatever kind of Italian baked good your heart desires that day- and I'll be sure to go back to try more. (One thing I would note, however, is that the tiramisu gelato wasn't as great as I was hoping, considering how much I love gelato and tiramisu. I'd stick with the actual pastry next time.)

But that's not to say I'm not a fan! The service is great, even when there's a bit of a line the number system keeps it moving along. From a not-sweets standpoint, the food is also pretty delish. I tried the artichoke pizza and for TWO DOLLARS a slice was amazing, filling, and just what I was hoping for. I doubt you'll easily find a slice that as good and inexpensive as Presti's. Again, I'm hoping to try more of the menu, but the have a nice selection of Italian food prepared.

It also has a great atmosphere. Tons of nicely lit, indoor seating and lovely seating along the street. You can hear Italian music if you sit outside and soak in the ambiance of Cleveland's little Italy. Great for a quick bite, a coffee, or a treat."}
{"text":"When it comes to bakeries, Presti's is one of the best, in my opinion. They have amazing pastries, cookies, and their entire food case is pure deliciousness.  They were a natural choice when I was asked by a very dear friend to bring pastries to the memorial dinner for her father, which happened to be in the neighborhood. 

In full disclosure, the 25 pc small pastry tray and 3 lb cookie tray I ordered were a thing of beauty, and they were very much appreciated by the family in such a sad time. Ultimately, that was my goal, and I was grateful to Presti's for delivering. 

My criticism has to do with the folks working at the counter. When I arrived, there were several people milling around, but I didn't see a discernible line.  Since I had a timed pick up (1:00, but it was 12:45 - I told them my circumstances in advance, knowing it may be a few minutes either way), and I was prepaid, I asked a counter employee where I should go to pick up my order. Mind you, I have been in better places in my life, seeing that we literally had just left Lakeview Cemetery under extremely sad circumstances, I was frozen to the bone, I had cried so many tears, and I was illegally parked. The woman who responded literally scolded me for not taking a number, like I was a child. It is rare to read such disdain from a stranger, but I got that from her. Just for asking a question. Ok...so I took a number. And I waited. And waited. There were no less than 4 people behind the counter, and a customer would come for an order every now and again. They all ignored me until my number was called.  When I told the man behind the counter that I had a prepaid order under my name, I got the feeling that he couldn't be bothered. I got a \"they're still working on it.\" Ok...minutes passed, and workers bustled to and fro. At this point, I'm starting to panic, since everyone from the cemetery had already been at the meal for awhile. Finally, a pleasant young woman asked me if I had been helped, and I told her what I was waiting for. She told me she would check on the status, and several minutes later, another woman brought out a lovely platter of small cheese cakes, etc. 

I don't know what the story was, but the \"can't be bothered\" hipster vibe I got from this pickup was the last thing I expected from a Cleveland institution. I am very aware that we get what we give, and I strive to treat the people I interact with kindness. While I arrived with a sad heart, I didn't deserve the coarseness I initially received. For that reason, I'll probably think twice next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch in the area. They have tons of options, including soups, salads, and pasta. Their strombolis and pizza are also excellent. My favorite is the pesto or artichoke tortellini, or the eggplant parmesan. The baked goods are excellent, and it's hard to just get one! The specialty stuff like cheesecakes can be a little pricey though. I'm glad they brought back the doughnuts, because they're probably the best doughnuts I have ever had.

The gelato is also very good. I'm a big fan of one called Donatella. It's like a remake of the Ferrero Rocher chocolates, with rice krispies, chocolate and hazelnuts. Absolutely delicious!

Presti's is great for getting some work done and people watching as well. You can get great coffee, and use their free wifi. The only downfall is the rush during lunch/dinner. At least you can take a number and be served in order."}
{"text":"This is a really good bakery to come and hang out if you've got some time to kill. The staff are nice,, the chai latte is good, not too sweet, and the pastries are fantastic! I'm just a tourist, so I can't tell you how good they are on the regular, but from my visit, it was great!"}
{"text":"Presti's is great.  I mostly go here for cheap lunch and can't really vouch for their baked goods and desserts, except to say that their cannoli are tasty (cannoli is plural).

It's really convenient to come her for lunch if you work at CWRU or UH.  For me, it's a ten minute walk, so I only come here when I have some extra time to kill.  Ever since I started getting lunch here it has been hard for me to justify paying more for a slice of cardboard pizza in the cafeteria than it costs for a slice of Presti's pizza.

By the way, I recommend the artichoke pizza.  It's amazing.  

The have a \"take a number\" system and they are often busy around lunch time.  Even when the place is packed it only takes about ten minutes for your number to be called."}
{"text":"Breakfast quiche! Cookies! Gelato! How can you NOT be a fan of this place? It really is a Cleveland institution. 

I like to come here from breafast all the way to my afternoon snack. For breakfast, I like to get their breakfast quiche or the croissant sandwiches. They're super buttery and flaky and filled with egg and cheese and your choice of breakfast meats. They're hearty and filling. 

For my mid-morning snack, I'd pick up a few cookies. There's an assortment of cookies and you purchase them by weight. I often like to get a few of each. It's not too expensive considering the amount of butter that's in these babies. You can taste the clogging of your arteries -- now that's a damn good cookie. 

For lunch, they have a lot of meal combos. From the Italian favorites of meatballs and cavatelli to a quick lasagna, they've got your lunch meal ready for less than 10 dollars. I often get one for there (they'll heat it up) and one to go (they close pretty early so dinner is sometimes not an option). 

For my afternoon snack (I sometimes like to stay inside all day because with their free internet and delicious coffees, I can afford a study date there), I like to pick up a pastry. They used to start selling their morning donuts at a discount starting in the afternoon. It seems like their donut chef has recently left and so there are NO MORE donuts. But that's alright, I suppose, because I'm filling the donut hole in my heart with plenty of chocolate tirimisu and lemon tarts. 

But if the pastry gods are listening, please bring back the donuts! PLEASEEEE!!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York, so when I was in Cleveland on a business trip, I had to see the city's \"Little Italy\" section for myself. While it wasn't too big, it made up for it with places like Presti's. I had gotten dinner elsewhere, but stopped in here at the recommendation of my hotel staff for dessert. I took home some pistachio gelato, and was not disappointed. Arguably some of the best I've ever had, and that's from a New Yorker!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place with my husband several times and it's about time I leave a review. We specifically go to get a baked dessert and a coffee drink. I would say the coffee drinks are average at best. Nothing special. However, I think the desserts are as good if not better than anywhere in Cleveland. Given the reasonable prices, the convenience, and the quality of the dessert, I would rank it the best dessert place in Cleveland in my opinion. I won't get too specific about this encounter because as I mentioned previously, I've been here over 20 times. But we tend to get the carrot cake, chocolate mousse, raspberry mousse, tiramisu, or Cassata cake. All of them are excellent. The chocolate mousse is amongst the best chocolate mousse I've had anywhere in the world. It's simply an outstanding place and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This store worked like a well oiled machine on a busy Friday night.  We took our number ticket on the way in and had a few minutes to check out the cases until our numbers were called.  The staff members were both friendly and quick at getting everything together.  I purchased a cannoli and a chocolate dipped macaroon.  I am in love with that cannoli, delicious!  I will get that again along with some cookies, cakes, gelato...."}
{"text":"Presti's did not disappoint me.  They have always had a great reputation for fine Italian pastries and other bakery items such as fresh bread.  Well, I write this to tell all, that the reputations continues.  The brownies, homemade cookies and of course, the canoli's were some of the best I have ever had.  When ever I am visiting Cleveland, I try to make a visit to Presti's Bakery."}
{"text":"Since I live in the south now I don't get to enjoy the ethnic bakeries like I did when I was a kid growing up in Cleveland. I was literally a big kid in a candy store except the candy store was an Italian bakery and deli!  Got a nice variety of cookies and a small antipasto. Kolachy's and macaroons were my favs. We arrived at 3pm in a Saturday and there was no wait. Parking wasn't too bad, just found a spot in a side street. Staff was very friendly. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"The largest selection of baked goods in the area. The cassata cake is the best!!  Besides cookies, cakes, and various pastries, Presti's  also has a good selection of food. Breakfast and lunch/dinner foods. Gelato too. I have to say that the staff isn't the most friendly, but that doesn't make the food any less delicious. Giving four stars instead of five because I've had a few occasions where my orders have been stale."}
{"text":"Food fairly good for Italian bakery. My taste buds may be spoiled by the tastes from Boston, New York, and  Italy though. Large variety of pastries and gelatos, also have some hot foods. 

Good amount of seating but bit loud to really have easy conversation. Service fast and efficient. They should wear hair nets though."}
{"text":"Always love having evening dessert here visiting from San Diego. I was hoping to get a slice of Cassata cake but this Easter Holiday weekend, the desserts were a bit limited and focused on Easter cakes and cookies. So, no Cassata cake!  However, I went with Option B which is always consistently satisfying...a Cannoli and a coffee!!! Yum!!! To be honest, you cannot go wrong with any of the dessert offerings. Try the Cannoli cake..."}
{"text":"It was a cold summer day in Cleveland.  (I love the fact that that occurs here...)  Walking briskly around Little Italy, we happened into this little cafe, drawn in by the tempting word:  Gelato.

I have no idea how the canolis, bread, sandwiches, or stromboli taste... but I know the Gelato is pretty good.  While service wasn't warm, it wasn't bad.  The decor is light and cheerful, and despite numerous other empty restaurants nearby, this one was mostly full.  

So, despite mediocre service, we had good gelato, and colour us satiated.  :)"}
{"text":"I bought a little of most things to bring back to my friend in LA, where we have few good Italian bakeries, and none that I have been to are even half as good as Presti's! I liked everything I got: cannoli, the white cookies with sprinkled, the jam cookies, some cookies with nuts, the cinnamon star sugar cookies, EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"The best Cannoli I've ever had! Facts! Luv this place. Great place for a first date or coffee with friends. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for 10 star! Being italian, I know a good meatball when I smell one! But everything at Presti's smells like it just came out of my grandma's oven! I absolutely LOVE their pepperoni bread with marinara sauce! I'll have to give it to them, they have the best pasta sauce in little Italy! Their bakery is divine, and the gelato they make is amazing! Even on a busy summer Saturday, they still get through the line quickly and efficiently. Presti's is my #1 place when I go down to Little Italy!"}
{"text":"This is a staple bakery and cafe in Little Italy. I come here for meetings, work, and to meet up with friends! It has a neighborhood feel, which is nice.

Some of my favorites are the spinach bread and the pesto or sun dried tomato tortellini! All are very reasonably priced. I usually grab a coffee too.

They also sell day old bread for $1 -- still really good! 

Desserts here are delicious!

One of my favorite things to do here is to people watch. There are often elderly (and often cantankerous) 1st generation Italian American men who know everyone, and love to comment about everything! It's great.

Street parking is hard, but you can park on Coltman (one way street.)"}
{"text":"Love the place, another Cleveland landmark in the heart of Little Italy. Too many good things for your sweet tooth and for breakfast, never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Love this place for it's pastries!!  In general, any combo of pastries is $12.50/lb.  I've tried the raspberry swirls, some of the chocolate chip pastries and a handful of others.  Great variety, good service and I'll keep coming back to it!  I need to try some of the brownies/cannolis etc on future visits however.

Word of wisdom: make sure to take a number during peak business hours or else you won't get served.  They move pretty quickly: for example, I was in Little Italy during the Feast of the Assumption party and when I walked in, I pulled #33 and they were on #10.  They were on me in less than 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Make sure you grab a number.

We got a piece of pizza, a small sweet and a drink for under $5. 

It's in the heart of little Italy. 

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Presti's recently and it was delicious!  I had an eggplant sandwich and my friend had a veggie sandwich.  The restaurant is a counter-service place with a large, Italian-food selection, plenty of pastries and house-made breads.  The workers were very friendly and they were very helpful (and apologetic) when my first choice was sold out for the day.  There are plenty of options and many price points so there is something for everyone.  Parking is either in nearby parking lots or street parking.It wasn't too busy at lunchtime but it might be tough to find parking in the evenings."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it from the previous three reviews, but this place actually makes more than donuts!  Gasp all you want, but it's true.  When the sun has not yet gone to sleep, and people have had fewer than two martinis for the day, Presti's Bakery serves sandwiches, paninis (okay, that's Italian for sandwich), pizzas, flatbreads, and other lunch-able items during the day.

And, on a beautiful day like today, sitting at one of the bistro tables along the sidewalk makes one feel like they actually live in an urban city envrionment.  It's pretty great."}
{"text":"It's always super busy so they food is worth the trip, but the service is spotty (somtimes great, sometimes I feel as if I'm inconveniencing the staff).  We generally get cookies to take back for friends, family, co-workers and there are always raves."}
{"text":"I can't believe how long it took for me to finally come upon this gem in Little Italy. I  came here for lunch the other day, and I ordered the sausage and spinach stromboli with a side of marinara sauce. This was so delicious and so incredibly CHEAP! I also tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi, which was also bombdiggity! I definitely recommend trying their hot foods, which are located to the right side of the registers. They're affordable and yummy in the tummy! You also should try their apricot linzers and mini chocolate macaroons--they're to die for!

Two thumbs up for Presti's!"}
{"text":"After a late morning at MOCA, we headed to Little Italy and Presti's. This is a great lunch spot for people with diverse tastes as there is everything from pizza, to pastas,salads and panininis. All reasonably priced, with a great selection from their bakery for desert. (Hint: save room for Creme Brulee). It can get a bit crowded at lunch and be sure to take a number as they use them, and won't get around to you as fast if you just stand in line. Yes, it's a bit confusing, but that's part of the fun. They bring the food to your table and you bus your plates once you have finished."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I would take out of town guests.  Not only is it located in a 'must-experience' neighborhood it trumps most other little cafes for a variety of reasons.  Great cappuccino and even better people watching (I could go on and on about the time I saw a kid drop a tv) top the list.  I've never had a bad meal here whether I am ordering treats or pizza! Presti's holds many of my favorite memories from first dates to singing happy birthday!"}
{"text":"Best bakery in Cleveland. Cannolis are the absolute best. Space is new and modern but maintains the old school charm of this classic Cleveland spot."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery in Little Italy. After dinner at Maxi's, we came here for dessert and it was jammed packed. When I got our ticket, we were number 69 and they were at number 35. However, we didn't need to wait too long. Just a little patience! It was worth the wait. We got several desserts to share - cannolis, two slices of tiramisu, a slice of Sorrentina (hazelnut cake), a slice of German chocolate cake, and a slice of cherry cheesecake. Everything was moist and delicious. Definitely coming back here again to try their cassata cake!"}
{"text":"Wow! Reminds me of the espresso and pastries in Italy!  Wonderful coffee, cookies, cappuccinos. Outdoor seating is great for watching passersby.  We almost never order dessert while dining out in Little Italy, because the sweets are better at Presti's (with the exception of Antonio's Tiramisu at Il Bacio!). Very reasonably priced deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Rude staff! Nothing kills it like having a bunch of rude staff. No matter how the food is! And The food is ok. As it would be in an Italian place. My third visit here they had this constant cacophony which lasted for atleast 30 minutes before I asked an overweight middle aged female staff what it was and how long it would continue. She was rude unapologetic about the noise and was like 'seriously? that's the bread being cut. The business has to go on.' Snickering behind my back. It lasted for 20 more minutes before I decided to leave. That's not how you treat customers. If you know it's going to make that amount of noise you take the machine inside away from the seating area. Pity I liked the ambience of the place. It has lovely lighting good seating. But I won't ever return and world never recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"This is THE place to be in little Italy. Stop in for lunch, coffee, gelato or their amazing bakery items. The margerita pizza is fantastic and my favorite, must-have item is their iced mocha. I'd come here every morning for it if I could."}
{"text":"A great meal and time in Little Italy in Cleveland! The Italian Sandwich was fresh and amazing along with the Antipasta salad. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff is friendly.  Nice place to hang out before going to the Art Museum."}
{"text":"Great bakery in Little Italy! Stopped by for a coffee and a little treat. They have so many pastries and other desserts to choose from, and there's seating outside so you can enjoy the sun on a nice day."}
{"text":"Ok, I am sure you are surprised to be seeing only 3 stars, but let me clarify. There stuff is downright yummy!  However, their service is horrible...they are ridiculously slow and rude. Additionally, what's with the crazy hours? They close way too early. At the end of the day the yummy factor is outweighed by all the other factors so it will be a long while before I go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dessert, so this is a partial review.  We had a cannoli, a fruit tart, and a biscotti.  The Cannoli & Biscotti were nothing to write home about, the biscotti was tiny for the price and quite standard, & the cannoli cream wasn't very good & we are from the Northeast so NYC & Philly bakeries have spoiled us.  But the Fruit Tart was excellent, lots of fruit, not too much cream & the shell/cup were really good.  I'm not sure it was in house made, but it made the long wait (take a # as you walk in or wait even longer) almost worth it."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff that will cater to all your needs! You can't go wrong with any dessert that you buy because everything is delicious. The mochas are super good drink wise and I love the Italian cheesecake and cannoli."}
{"text":"This bakery is really excellent. I last came with my family for a mid-afternoon snack. We ordered a meat Stromboli and an assortment of desserts- a slice of sorrentina cake, a classic cannoli, and a creme brûlée. I have always loved the cannolis and creme brûlée here, so those were fantastic as always! The sorrentina was tasty, but there was a layer in it that I didn't really enjoy, so I probably wouldn't order that again. The stromboli was pretty solid as well. Also, even when this place is super busy, everyone behind the counter is always super nice and helpful, and their ticket system for getting through orders is really efficient. Overall, a great little gem in little Italy that I'll definitely come back to whenever I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"When you think of Italian bakery...your first thought should be this place! Probably the best pastries I have had in a very long time and the wait shows how much everyone loves this place too! We ordered the Stromboli and a slice of pizza along with many pastries to go. The service was friendly and quick. The food was delicious!!! I only wish we lived across the street and could go to this place almost everyday!! If in Little Italy this is a place I think everyone must try and take something home for later!"}
{"text":"Presti's best dessert is their custard fruit tart (weekends only). Cannoli is okay, but if you get it later in the day, it tends to be soggy and cold. The other desserts vary depending on freshness. But it's not above Presti's to still serve stale desserts well after their prime time. 

I came here a lot this semester because of the great atmosphere. It's my \"happy place\" in Cleveland. Their lunch foods, though appealing from behind the glass, NEED some improvement. It's not even big changes - little things, like actually adding salt, spices, not having the pasta soak in its own sauce for hours, or putting enough filling in the strombolis. When they have the sandwiches out, get them! They're possibly the only certain delicious item on the lunch menu! Personal favorite. 

Coffee is yucky! Bland, with little suspicious pools of oil floating on top. Tea is okay though, and they have a respectable selection. My little brother loves their hot chocolate topped with whip. 

To their credit, despite some questionable foods, Presti's service is TOPS. I love the older lady with blonde hair and a big smile. They are always happy to help, and that is enough to bring me back time and time again. I visit all the time, and have only met one exception to the rule: a younger, dark-haired male server with a very bad attitude (I once asked him to re-heat my ice-cold chicken pot pie, and he over-cooked it, forgot about it, and then tossed it at me when I asked for it back without an apology! Bad day for him, I guess, or he's just an ass. Have avoided him since.)

If I'm honest with myself, though I love Presti's and come back often, I don't think it would survive if it had a little more competition. They have to rethink their lunch menu, or not offer lunch at all. And if the desserts are stale, don't sell them. It isn't worth damaging your reputation. The only viable competition for them is Corbo's up the street - not enough to catalyze any serious change."}
{"text":"Can I just say I LOVE this place? Every time I am in the area, I need to go there to get some tiramisu. Wide selection, reasonable prices, get a table next to the full glass windows and enjoy Little Italy to the fullest. 

PS - The one thing that is a bit annoying is that there's a minimum purchase amount you need to make before you can use your credit card. I think the amount is 5$...but cannot remember for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a must try when in little italy, cleveland. They have a huge selection of cookies, pastries and cakes. It's mesmerising. They also have hot foods, anything from pizza, strombolies, sandwiches and pastas. We stopped in around lunch time and it was jammed. You must take a ticket and wait, but it is definitely worth it, plus it gives you time to decide what you would like. 

We ordered the blueberry cheesecake, cannoli, lobster tail and a piece of cassata cake. Everything was delicious. The cannoli was one of the best I have ever had. Cheesecake was nice and creamy and not overly sweet. Lobster tail had nice buttery layers with the soft marzipan filled center. The only disappointment was the cassata cake. It seemed old. The cake was dry, the strawberries were mushy and did not have a great flavor. It could have been because it was during the \"Feast of the Assumption\" and they made a ton of them. Even with that we would still return next time we are in little italy."}
{"text":"I had Presti's cater an event for my residency program. For the dinner, we ordered 2 vegetarian stromboli, 1 sausage strombolo, 1/2 pan of meat lasagna, 1/2 pan of vegetarian lasagna, and 1 pan of salad. 

Overall, our experience with the staff was phenomenal. Our order was done on time, and the staff helped me carry the order out to the car. They also had receipts ready as I left. Ordering over the phone was easy, and every person I interacted with on the way was wonderful.

As far as the food goes, overall, we were wowed. 

Lasagna: Excellent. Both the vegetarian and meat lasagna were a hit, and definitely fed more people than we thought they would. There was a great amount of cheese, and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.

Stromboli: The meat stromboli was a hit, but the vegetarian strombolo was not the greatest. Don't get me wrong: it was good, but I probably would order something else off the menu; the inside was a bit bland, though it was well cooked.

Salad: Pretty standard salad overall: Lettuce, tomato, olives, cucumber. Fantastic balsamic dressing that everyone loved.

I will absolutely have Presti's cater another event, and I am excited to eat more of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! This place is always packed with people which is why you have to remember to take a number from the deli-number-roller-machine at the entrance. Nice assortment of deliciousness. 

Parking is a nightmare though!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a couple if yrs but stopped today & was disappointed. Never found ticket disperser, older lady waited on me was a bit rude. Peanut butter bars tasted like they had canned frosting on them..kinda gross. Not what it used to be. I'll go elsewhere next week."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place.   Great food and services."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times. They have some good stuff. I go for the artichoke pizza, spinach bread, various cookies and the Creme brûlée. 

BUT far too many times I have found them to be selling old or spoiled food. The worst was when I got a piece of cheesecake to go and came home to find it had mold on it. Multiple times items have been noticeably stale. I think they really have good desserts, but the lack of attention to quality control when it comes to freshness is a big turn off and often results in me not going there when I might be in the mood for a tasty treat. 

Another epic letdown for me is they never have fresh bread in the morning. They roll it out in the early afternoon. What kind of bakery doesn't have fresh bread in the morning? 

Often they waiver between using their number system and using clustered lines to serve customers, causing confusion. Just stick to the number system, Presti's. 

One thing they've never let me down on is their cappuccinos - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great cannoli and sfogliatelle but what self respecting Italian bakery has never heard of Zeppole otherwise known as St Joseph's Day cakes.  And they call themselves Italian???"}
{"text":"Stopped by on recommendation from a local police officer. She was spot on. Great bakery. Muffins were cake like and addictive. Cookies were great. Cannoli was great, yet I have to say I do not eat it often. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I did give 5 stars yet I did not eat any other food. It looked great. A must stop for Little Italy."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time today. I purchased 3 cannoli and 3 coffees. It was $20. That's sort of steep. I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Presti's until now. It is my favorite place in Little Italy and though I can't remember everything I have ever ordered, I haven't had anything from here that I didn't love. You can't go wrong with any of it! Whether you are in the mood for some gelato, coffee, a pastry, dessert (TONS to choose from) brushetta, a sandwich, the list goes on and on and on..... I guarantee you won't have one thing on the menu that doesn't satisfy your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Presti's Bakery in Cleveland's Little Italy began as a humble shop in what was definitely a not very trendy working class neighborhood at the turn of the century ... not this one, but the one before.  While the demographics may have changed, they appear to have remained consistent and keep on thriving.

I already knew how I'd be rating them and I'm right in there with the pack.  I look at the rare 1 and 2 star reviews and wonder what they're all about.  Then, even 4 and 5 star places have valid 1 and 2 star experiences by the rare few.  Fortunately, these are outliers and, if that's what someone actually experienced, then that was unfortunate.

While it's in Cleveland, where the Great Lakes Midwest meets the Northeast, Presti's looks like it could be in New England.  It looks homey and beckons you to come in.  And, should you go in, you will be greeted by a line and you will have to take a number ... and be patient.

Presti's is mostly about being a bakery, with the left two thirds of the lengthy front counter being dedicated to desserts, cookies, and breads, with some of them being fairly elaborate.  There is also lunch fare such as pizzas, hefty sandwiches, focaccias, salads, and even some pastas.  Those looked good, but nowhere near as tantalizing as the desserts.  And their baked goods are what they are known for.

You should not go here every day though, on one visit, I made back to back trips to Presti's!  I've tried about four desserts, but two have been committed to memory.  The first is their cannoli with the chocolate shells.  The second, and my favorite, is their Italian cheesecake.  I am not a fan of the sometimes bland taste of ricotta but, given how it is blended and metered into the mix, the cheesecake was excellent.  

The service ranged from being perfunctory and polite to being enthusiastic and friendly, and they are always crowded.  The pricing is a little higher than what you might expect for some items, but you get what you pay for.  The interior is both old school and modern.  There are floor to ceiling windows in front, but the rest of it has older wooden tables, chairs and booth type seating against the wall, and one of those old school (copper) ceilings.  The crowd is eclectic, considering that this is both a touristic area and that it's a few blocks east of the city's main train line, while Case Western Reserve University is a few blocks to the west of it.

Wrapping it up, the sum total of the parts here is quite good.  And, when they had run out of Italian cheesecake, the young lady helping me summoned an Italian looking guy who told me that some was being made and asked me if I could wait.  I did.  And he even brought it out to the table.  

For those complaining about parking, I have to laugh.  Presti's is neither in Boston's North End nor in San Francisco's North Beach.  The parking is doable and, if this vexes you, take the train to the rapid station only 1 or 2 blocks away.  

Lastly, when I ordered a chocolate cannolo and a slice of Italian cheesecake, I ordered the exact same items to be put into a box so I could give them to a friend since it was coincidentally close enough to her birthday.  If my friend, whose parents ran an Italian restaurant, got a (by then) stale cannolo and slice of Italian cheesecake and sang the praises for Presti's for several weeks after that, then that really says something.  Presti's is in a league with the sorts of Italian bakeries you'd find in New York, Boston, or Chicago, though probably not in any points west of those."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, and fresh! Located in the heart of Little Italy, this bakery is a hit. I enjoyed he raspberry thumbprint cookies and the lemon bar. The pepperoni bread was amazing."}
{"text":"Amid a delightful neighborhood filled with nice sit-down restaurants lies Presti's. This is the holy grail of \"take a number and wait in line\".

Family run, Presti's offers a full range of baked goods, italian fare, espresso drinks, and even gelato! They always have different foods made fresh in the display ripe for the ordering. If the crowds are any indication of popularity, then they might be Regina George without the attitude. 

My only advice is get there early unless you want a long line!"}
{"text":"Food: 5

The best biscotti I've ever tasted. Probably the best cappuccino and cinnamon roll as well. This place lives up to its hype for sure."}
{"text":"There's more to this place than bakery.

To be honest, I prefer the other bakery in Little Italy as far as sweets. But I will say this... Presti's has THE BEST Coconut Macaroon on the planet. I go there just to get those alone. They are huge, crusty on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside and half dipped in dark chocolate. Be sure not to put these babies in plastic though, they are best when the outside is crusty. Best to eat them as soon as you get them! There are some other notable baked goods, like the brownie cookie, the soft biscotti cookies, anise cookies and the higher end stuff in the far case like tiramisu and iced brownies.  They also make a killer cappuccino.

Now here is where Presti's shines... they've got tons of good food and their space is super cozy. 

Whenever I come home and don't feel like cooking, I head over to Presti's for some takeout. I love the chicken picatta and marsala, the clam linguini, the various other pasta dishes. Their cold salads like egg, potato and chicken salad taste like you made it at home. There's this polenta bake that I absolutely LOVE. The pizza is pretty decent, although I usually end up throwing on more cheese. At breakfast time, they have great croissant sandwiches. Generally, the food is very good and reasonably priced. There's a lot to choose from and the offerings aren't always the same. 

Presti's is a great place to sit and hang. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside seating is great. They are in the perfect location. You can enjoy free Wi-Fi as well. You will always find a bunch of locals on laptops. Be sure to take a number if need be. When it is really busy, they will go by the number tickets."}
{"text":"I found this bakery here on yelp about two years ago and decided to try it because of the wonderful reviews. I'm glad that I did! Anytime I need a cake this is where I get it from. The buttercream frosting is the Best I've ever had! The prices are good and so is the prepared food! You MUST try Presti's!!!"}
{"text":"Presti's isn't the most exciting or greatest place out there, but it has good quality for the price. The pastries and assorted food items are solid, and surprisingly cheap. Their coffee is inconsistent (sometimes quite good, sometimes meh), their pastries are pretty good, and their food is satisfying enough. Great place to go for a cheap breakfast/lunch.

An interesting mix of neighborhood characters, young families, and college/graduate students from Case, CIM, and CIA come through here. It was on the way to school when I was a student at CIM, so I stopped here frequently.

Be warned: this place is extremely crowded during peak hours (most crowded between Noon and 2pm) and it may take a while to get to the counter to order and receive your food. The staff is also inconsistent. Some are very friendly (more so during quieter hours), some are very brusque."}
{"text":"One word. YUM. Two words.  Cookies.... gelato.  Always stop to get dessert here after my meal down the street!"}
{"text":"Food is a hit or miss
Dessert is decent

First with the negative (and im being a little nit picky with some of these) :
-The orange sauce (dare I call it Vodka sauce?) they use on several of their pastas is as bland as sauces come. I get this undesirable powder-y aftertaste each time I give it a chance, hoping for improvement. PLEASE, add some salt (and other seasonings)! Also, a little less cream wouldn't hurt either
-Unless you like water with mysterious flakes and hair from unknown origins, stay away from the complimentary water by the utensil area. PLEASE clean that dispenser! 
-I used to come just for the stromboli (sausage and spinach), but recently it has become a lot doughier with less filling and more bread. The ratio was great before, please bring that back! I'd rather have a smaller piece with more filling to dough ratio than a large bready one
-If you are charging $4-5 for a small slice of carrot cake, please make sure it is still fresh. The one time I got it, it was so dry and miserable I threw it out
-Please find a donut-man asap! I really miss your old donuts!

But why does Presti's still get 4 stars in my book?
Atmosphere

I don't come to Presti's craving anything in particular (except the cannoli, and the eggplant parm), I come because Presti's has created this consistent, wonderful vibe in their animated bakery, with their friendly staff, large-glass windows, and customers of all ages. Even when Cleveland is bringing you down on a depressing grey Sunday morning, a warm coffee with a pastry at Presti's will guarantee to lift your spirits. Maybe it's the warm lighting, maybe it's the friendly staff, maybe it's the rich selection of desserts, Presti's just has that special something that you don't find in any of the other food stops in Little Italy.

Also, Presti's is one of the most fairly priced places to eat in the area. You can get a stromboli, a side of pesto tortellini, a coffee, and a cookie, all for around $10! That itself should be enough reason to go

I really do think that with a few minor tweaks, this lively bakery could be \"As good as it gets!~\"

{"text":"Best Stromboli and cannoli. Excellent customer service and don't miss the gelato. Parking may be little struggle but you will definitely find a spot. Their cookies is delicious"}
{"text":"Love this bakery! The coffee is the perfect acidity and strength. I also tried a bacon and egg croissant and it was huge and delicious. They also have patio seating which I enjoy because sipping coffee and watching the world go by is entertaining. I look forward to trying other items on Presti's menu. The coffee alone will bring me back."}
{"text":"The best place in town to get your bread from. Most of the restaurants in Little Italy buy their bread here. Great pastries namely the Napoleon, crembrule and fruit tart. Everything else is great too, hot espressos and cappuccinos included, but it can get expensive..."}
{"text":"Since I've already written about my experience at Presti's, I'll keep this brief.

I had lunch here today and enjoyed the eggplant parmigiana and a piece of the chicken cutlet. It was delish."}
{"text":"$3.50 for a Stromboli? That's a deal for lunch. It feels kind of weird that they charge you for marinara sauce to dip it in, though, like charging ketchup for a hot dog. Their week day staff are more grouchy than their weekend staff, I think."}
{"text":"A great place to get a variety of pastries and I never miss an opportunity to get the spinach Stromboli. Yum!"}
{"text":"The desert counter here is amazing, it's absolutely loaded with goodies and everything looks magical. I want to try everything, restraint is definatly required. I ordered the chocolate dipped cannoli and since I am a cannoli traditionalist that was a first for me. The cannoli was as delicious as it should be and the chocolate shell strangely reminded me of chocolate matza. This is a large, packed bakery so grab a number when you walk in door as there will most likely be a wait if you come on a weekend night like I did. It's all good though because it'll give you time to peruse the offerings."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. I work in the area and have stopped in every so often. The food is decent for a quick bite, not amazing. Tonight I wanted to grab a bite to eat before a meeting. There were 5 people ahead of me with one person actually taking orders. Two other workers were looking at a register down by the bakery. Another worker stocking beverages and people working in the back, but none stepped in to help orders go faster. Five more people came in over the next ten minutes and still just one person taking orders. It took over 30 minutes to finally get called. Not worth it! It was infuriating to see the workers just ignore the fact that there was a huge line and only one person getting customers food."}
{"text":"We took a number from a number dispenser not unlike one that you'd find in your local license bureau and neatly shuffled behind the hungry Saturday night crowd that flocked to this bakery. It took maybe 10-15 minutes total, which is not bad for THAT kind of crowd.

We went home with our precious Tiramisu and other baked goods. As far as Tiramisus go, this one was among the airiest, fluffiest and most delicate ones I've tried. I'd say it's up there with the best I had. Easy to inhale.

This is a great place for dessert and perhaps, paradise if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Presti's is my favorite place in Little Italy. Offering up stromboli, pizza, sandwiches and salads- Presti's is a one stop shop for lunch in Little Italy.

They have the absolute best variety of desserts (including gelato). The cassata cake and chocolate eclairs are MUST tries.

The restaurant is bathed in natural light and the decor is just so darn modern and pretty. Top-notch people watching is an added bonus.

Come here! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The service can be slow if they're busy so this is not a place to stop for something quick. They have a huge selection of Italian pastries, cakes, breads, slices of pizza, and prepared foods. Their cappuccino is fabulous and topped with cinnamon. We loved the chocolate cannoli cake, what I would consider a chocolate version of cassata cake. Their anise cookies were also great. Down fall, was that the cannoli were filled and sitting in the case not filled to order for ideal texture and flavor."}
{"text":"Although this place is known for its sweets, I love coming here for lunch! They serve a pretty nice assortment of food as well as their dessert items. All items are displayed behind glass cases. During busier hours, they serve you by your number, so be sure to take one when you enter. 

I usually get the spinach bread and a large order of their seafood mac and cheese. If you haven't had their mac and cheese, you're missing out! There is such great flavor to it! The pasta itself is cooked perfectly every time and it isn't overly cheesy. The mac and cheese is topped with bits of real crab meat. It tastes amazing! Their spinach bread is made fresh daily. It's basically a large bun stuffed with spinach and a bit of cheese. It tastes great with their fresh marinara sauce.

I like their pastries as well, their tiramisu is quite good. I'm also a fan of their \"restaurant\" bread. Presti's supplies the bread to most of the restaurants' in Little Italy. 

What I like about this place is that it's a great place to hang out and people watch. The store front has floor to ceiling windows that overlook the busy street."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland on business Saturday morning and stopped at Presti's for breakfast. What a fun place! Both people working were friendly and helpful. My husband had a cinnamon roll and black coffee. I had sfogliatelle and cafe au lait. Both were delicious! It was really early, so we were the only customers. It was nice to have the whole place to ourselves because we could peruse the delicious looking, beautiful bakery items without feeling rushed. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious desserts (cakes/pastries), coffee, tea, etc. Cookies, depending on what you get, are good but not the best I've had.

Cons: Always pretty packed (and hard to get around inside due to space), and the number system with lots of people all around makes me a bit anxious. However, once you've been here a few times, you get used to it. I just make sure to look at all of the desserts and so that I am ready to choose when called."}
{"text":"Outstanding venue!  Especially if you are some kind of writer/graduate student type.  There is a wide array of yummy food (I have to restrain myself from all the baked goodies!  Only garden salad for me :(), iced tea is only $1.50, and ice-cold water is free!  There is also plenty of seating (including a patio area) and the place has free wi-fi.  This place beats Starbucks hands-down, especially since it doesn't have that annoying loud music that Starbucks insists on playing to drive-away thrifty writer table-hoggers like myself.  I'm almost afraid to review this place because I don't want to see it over-crowded by all the students in University Heights but hey, I'm learning to share."}
{"text":"Both times while in Cleveland we visited Presti's bakery for their ice cream. It was a nice place with a large comfortable space and we saw that they also had a large variety of baked goods  as well Italian foods, [pizza, stromboli, salads] and  juices, sodas, etc. It is in the heart of Little Italy and the staff was very nice and accommodating. It merits a vist if you are in the Cleveland area and visit Little Italy for dinner as we did. It is easily accessible via the RTA to Euclid/120th Street."}
{"text":"The best tiramisu and gelato in town. Light dinners range from 7-10 dollars. The paninis are fabulous and so are the Cavetelli and meatball.  You enter and take a ticket. (If there are people blocking the doorway with deer in the headlight expression yell \" excuse me\" and then push your way in.) Very clean and laid back atmosphere. Prestis is mostly known as  a bakery. Its an after dinner treat in Little Italy. Great sidewalk cafe seating as well as seating indoors. Silverware and cold water are self serve as are the sodas and other beverages. Great place to take a date after dinner. I prefer the Stracciatella ice cream but the spumoni is good too. The lunch specials are hit or miss and I've had one served ice cold. No I'm not kidding. Stick to dessert anx you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I cannot possibly understand how this place has so many good reviews. Yes, the food is okay but certainly nothing great. I've been there twice, one time for something sweet and another time for breakfast. The sweets were okay but breakfast was lame. We waited in line for over 15 minutes to get microwave French toast with cheap syrup in plastic containers (just like a crappy fast food restaurant) and food that would've been better at McDonald's (note that I hate McDonald's and never eat there). 

It's also rather amazing that you're confronted with tip jars. Do they really expect us to tip after STANDING in line for 15+ minutes and serving ourselves? Be sure to clean up your own table because nobody else does it there. The 'service' is nonexistent - there is no service. 

I have to believe that many of these reviews were paid for because if real customers wrote them they must have gone to a completely different place or live in a parallel universe. This place is totally overrated. Sorry to be a Debbie downer but save your time, money and diabetes - there are better choices."}
{"text":"I am the least likely person to review an Italian bakery. I have a short list of ingredients I simply find intolerable. Italian bakers use anise, rum flavoring, almond flavoring, ricotta and citrons by the handful. If any one of these comes near me I lose my appetite. I have thrown out entire cakes when I detected rum flavor. Canoli stay away from my door, almond biscotti keep away from me. 

Presti's attracts a wide circle of fans. UH Nurses as well as patients and their families come here. CWRU students and faculty sit next to one another. People from all over as well as neighborhood residents sip coffee or bite into pizza. It is not possible to label Presti's as a hangout for any subgroup. It successfully caters to the many who come to the Circle and the Hill. 

The bread, bakery and pizza offer an abundance of choices to satisfy anyone. The prepared dishes ranging from simple sub sandwiches to chicken picatta are as good as any on the Hill. Since this is an Italian establishment gelato and expresso are available. 

This is a busy place. This is a happy place. Sitting here you are glad some of Cleveland survives. You can imagine you are in the past, or in a movie, or in some other place. Luckily you are on Mayfield Hill and can return."}
{"text":"When I went to school in Case Western, I went to Presti to get lunch very often. However, the taste is really just normal. The most terrible thing is the servers' speed is extremely slow!!!! It takes them 10 minutes to just get you a piece of pizza. They have enough people work there though, Those people just slow!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods. I'm here to talk about their Stromboli. The meat one, super delicious. The spinach & sausage, even better than the meat one. Their pizzas are almost like Sicilian style. Thick crust and very traditional. Guys, when they ask you if you want the red sauce... trust me say YES you definitely want it. It's probably the best I've tasted in little Italy. Their cannolis are also fresh and flavorful without being to sweet. So lucky to have this place in my back yard!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here on a Monday afternoon. My two friends and I  walk in and we were the ONLY people by the registers/dessert bar waiting to order desserts. The kid who with the brown hair and glasses that worked there kept calling out numbers (apparently you're suppose to grab a ticket when you walk in which Happens to be on the side where people exit) and they serve you according to your ticket number (because we live in the god damn 50's) My friends and I stood there for about 10 minutes when we finally ask if we can order desserts. The kid working there then scolds us about how we can only be served if we grab a ticket. I then replied that we will grab a ticket and the employee says \"I will serve you this time BUT NEXT TIME... Grab a ticket\" well guess what asshole, there won't be a next time. How about you serve your guests who are clearly not familiar with your stupid ticket service and kindly explain to them how your system works rather than making them feel like a moron. As our horrible experience continues, my friend orders about 4-5 delicious looking desserts. The employee then decides to make the rudest comment to her \"you know that saying... Don't go grocery shopping if you're hungry\"   no sir, we do not know that saying, please elaborate where your are going with this statement. Sorry for ordering desserts and supplying you with a paycheck, maybe next time we will order one single cookie so you can make 2.34$ an hour. As my friend was being \"served\" by this four eyed ass hat I was patiently waiting to be served also. I look over at the other employee who continues to flip his ticket numbers and shouting out numbers. We were still the only people at the dessert bar....  seriously?! Clearly this employee was also a moron. Finally the first employee finishes helping my friend and I ask him what his favorite dessert is. He replies \"Well I don't eat junk food\" ..........
.......
...............
Is this a fucking joke? You work in the restaurant industry clearly at a place that serves desserts and your response is that you don't eat junk food? Are you calling your employers delicious desserts \"junk\"? Nice  I did not  know how to respond to this peasants comment, so I continued to order what I thought looked good. I then ask him how they serve the biscotti cookies and he replies \"we sell them by the pound\" I then asked if I could get a half pound of biscotti cookies and he looks at me and asks \".......well how many do you want\" I then said \"I want a half pound\" and he says \"yeah but how many do you want?\"  I thought to myself \"Are you fucking with me child?\" I will take four cookies- I responded. They had two different cookies and I asked if the sign referred to the bottom ones ( the sign said cinnamon) and the worker responds \"um yeah... S is for cinnamon\"  um, okay. Finally he rang me out and I tipped him. I'm not sure why honestly. Probably because he was towering over me as I was signing my receipt. I would have rather donated my money to starving homeless people in Cleveland. Worst customer service I have EVER experienced and we will never go back. Very sad considering the desserts were amazing."}
{"text":"Oh.yes! Went here with my sister whom is a local. Had the chicken parm sandwich which was fantastic! Had bites of the cannoli cake, pumpkin cheesecake and pb brownie...all were amazing! The kids loved the pizza and desserts as well."}

I wish I had that guy's girl, what's his name? JESSIE
I once got molested by a man named WESLEY*
I love Barcelona and Suarez and MESSI
And will a dozen cannolis make my tummy look SEXY?

I like Italian stuff, from cars to CONFETTI
Lasagne too, pizza, and SPAGHETTI
If Italian girls don't like me, it's cause they never MET ME
Some of these don't rhyme cause I'm a little bit RUSTY

No matter, let's go and get pastry from PRESTI

WHAT

If your server is rude, just Presti button and a new one will appear!

OK that's not true, but the pastries are so good, you won't care.

I have to thank Robert in Portland for sending me to this beautiful Bakery. I got all kinds of really awesome pastries and treats, and even though they were sold out of a lot of stuff I very much enjoyed all of it. Some of the servers are not as friendly as others, but my one was really lovely.

Biscotti is still biscotti (I've never been impressed), but the cookie and the cannoli were excellent. I got a few extras for the cookie lovers and cannoli lovers back in Buffalo, and they absolutely loved them. I'm not sure if the Cannoli is as good as Brooklyn, but it's definitely in the same ball park (ew I just used a Baseball metaphor ew ew ew) which is a massive compliment, but not as massive as my...

Cheesecake. Cheesecake is pricey and wasn't amazing, but that's because the basic, which they're not as famous for, is all they had. Perhaps the Italian and chocolate versions will be better. 

I noticed Presti's has lots of good-looking customers (hi Italian girls) and a pretty strange format. You take a number and then wait (for what seems like decades) to be served. True Italian style. Mamma mia.

It's in the beautiful old Little Italy neighborhood of East Cleveland, and in many ways is the heart of the neighborhood. There's a reason it's always so busy and if you love bakeries you should try this for yourself.

Usually I'd avoid gorging on such delights (yes I'm still talking about Italian desserts... the pastry kind), but when you look at who we have as the Prestient of the USA, I think I can be forgiven for a little binging."}
{"text":"Amazing. Love their cinnamon stars..just wish they were a more reasonable price. 2 lbs cost me $26. Tiramisu($5) & cannolis are always good too!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee, pastry, or meal... But make sure you grab a number because the place is too busy to do a traditional line, they go by the number system. 
Thoroughly enjoy their cappuccinos and their creme brûlée is one of the best in Cleveland. I love the front window seats for people watching and seeing all the fashions in Little Italy"}
{"text":"I don't know if the Feast of the Assumption is the best time or the worst time to visit Little Italy, but I had a blast! And Presti's was on my list of must do's.  According to my research, they are known for having wonderful desserts.

The place was packed so I didn't really take time to peruse, but I did order my first cannoli! The crust just kind of melts in your mouth and I was left with this fluffy, sweet filling (I was expecting banana pudding but it's not that at all) with tiny chocolate chips. It wasn't nearly as sweet as I thought it would be (I was imagining like the jelly inside a donut). Very good. 

I heard Presti's had amazing sauce so I decided to get some stromboli too. It was good enough. Good meat, cheese, bread quotient but probably could have used a little more sauce. But I'm not Italian and maybe this is how it goes?

I would like to try this place when it's a little less busy. I can say that even in the mad rush of hundreds of people, the cashiers were wonderful! They were patient with me (I know very little about Italian sweets) and very helpful."}
{"text":"Though not vegan friendly, this is the BEST Italian bakery ever.  I spent like $40 in cookies to bring back to California with me after going to the area for an Irish wake and a high school reunion (guess which one was more fun?) - my coworkers were so impressed and all my friends raved about the yumminess of the cookies.  Best Italian Bakery EVERRRR!"}
{"text":"Presti's: Home to my favorite cannoli in the entire universe. The baked goods are Italian classics.  They are prepared extremely well, extremely traditionally, and extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Presti's has pretty good food and great prices!  If you want to grab a quick cheap lunch, look no further.  The food is good quality, I've been here 20+ times and never felt bad.  That's pretty good for a place where you can get lunch for $5.  The staff is OK. There's one older lady who messes up drink orders sometimes, but they always fix it in the end.  The sweets are delicious too!  If you want a fun community and good food at a great price, come to Presti's."}
{"text":"Good food, no question, but incredibly disorganized. It might deserve a better ranking except for the fact that there are many other strong Italian bakeries in the area that you might want to start with as opposed to this one."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Little Italy. I love hanging out here and catching up with friends.  I usually get the chai tea, and occasionally a baked good. I remember their gelato also being tasty.  I love going here in the summer so I can sit outside and people watch.  Staff is always very friendly.  Lines can get long during peak hours, but moves pretty efficiently."}
{"text":"Yummy bakery items. I especially enjoyed the cannoli. 
The espresso coffees are perfect, not overcooked like some places.

Looks like this place gets a LOT of regulars."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for a little bite if you're trying to hold out for dinner in another hour or 2. The pizza pieces are inexpensive and filling (very thick dough, but not \"doughy\" if you will). Their sandwiches are also very good. I think my favorite item in the whole place is the brownie cookie. It's this rich, chocolately cookie with powdered sugar on top. Heavenly!

I can't review their gelato because they've always been out or closed up that part when I've been in. From that view, it's probably very good?"}
{"text":"This had been a staple breakfast option for years. Few people realize they open very early, so those of us students and hospital workers can get a huge delicious fresh croissant breast sandwich at 630 am. Their pecan rolls are so good they disappear often within a few hours. Try the standard Italian favorites, like casada or tirimisu. I don't like their coffee only.  You can get things like salads and cutlets by the pound to take home which often is a great fast dinner option."}
{"text":"Great dinner combo! Very tasty eggplant parmesan with two rolls, salad, Italian coffee, and canoli! The staff was very friendly, quick with the order. 

The place was pretty busy and you do have to take a number, but that's to be expected on a nice spring day in Little Italy. I will say I have to give the edge to Corbo's on the canoli's. However, great experience here and I intend to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Yeah...
THE BEST!!!
Busy but went fast! Dude that waited on me was patient cause I kept piling on afterthoughts...so now I sit with my Pelligrino and enjoy hanging out in Little Italy!!!

I reallly like Presti's....
Aaaaaand... Bruchetta YUM! Stuffed meat stromboli? Aaah! Delsih!
I still have a sausage pizza in the fridge!!!
Yup...That rocks!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here all the time when I used to live in this neighborhood, but now drive all the way from Downtown to get their bread, pre-made foods, and pastries.  In addition, it's a very relaxing place to enjoy some coffee while reading the paper.  

My go-to thank you gift is a box of their cookies - they are truly splendid!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, currently staying downtown CLE caregiving for a family member at a nearby hospital. As an Italian/American I was craving better pasta than what the hospital cafeteria serves. Not knowing the area, I looked to Yelp for a well reviewed restaurant to get a decent pasta lunch at nearby Little Italy. Presti's Bakery had good reviews so that's where I went. Personally, I judge an Italian restaurant by it's carbs. As in... was that plate of pasta i ate worth the carbs? ---- In this case, NO!

The first clue I wasn't going to enjoy my pasta lunch at Presti's was ordering at a counter. However I have had great meals at restaurants without table service so I took a number and waited to order. However when the guy who took my order returned from the kitchen with a plate of pasta which he then put in a microwave I knew what was coming. Over cooked pasta with runny red sauce heated up in a microwave. The place was very busy so maybe it's just me. If you like your pasta served al-dente with thick flavorful red sauce and freshly grated cheese, Presti's isn't what you're looking for."}
{"text":"presti's is a really cute place to go for coffee.  their baked goods are pretty good, better than the savory lunch food types of things they have there (sandwiches, pastas, strombolis, etc.)

and the food is aiight. that's the only word i can think of that would most appropriately describe it. i think it's just a nicer place to sit in (or outside) for normal coffee and cookies and such.  but i've always come out of that place smelling like a walking human presti's for some reason. gross! 

3 stars for presti's, hip hip hooray."}
{"text":"I've learned that if you eat dinner in an ethnically-themed neighborhood (i.e. Little Italy), you should get dessert from the bakery down the street. In all likelihood, the restaurant is getting their desserts from the bakery and selling them at twice the price (with a scoop of gelato and a sprig of mint, of course). And so it was that I found myself at Presti's.

The desserts are beautiful. Eclairs, tarts, tons of cookies, cream puffs the size of my fist (and I have large hands). Having learned from previous botched bakery experiences, I ordered a cannoli and a piece of tiramisu to go. Both were outstanding - probably two of the best desserts I have ever eaten. I paid over $6 for the two items, which seems pricey, but it'll actually act as a deterrent for me going there daily to stock up on mascarpone-/ricotta-laden goodness.

So, when in Little Italy, dine at the restaurant of your choice, enjoy a glass of dessert wine senza dessert, and then walk over to Presti's."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pastry ever! I will never be able to eat another cannoli that will measure up to the one I had here. Unfortunately I live in Charlotte, NC so I will only be able to indulge once a year."}
{"text":"Prices seemed fair. 2 cannoli and two iced mochas were under around $10. The wait was very long despite how many employees were there it seemed only a few were actually getting anything done. One woman helped our group of 4 and when I tried getting a young mans attention to add to our order he told me that I would need to talk to the woman helping us. The cannoli was amazing though and so was the iced mocha. Everything in the place looked fantastic. If I ever find myself back in Cleveland I will surely spend more time in little Italy."}
{"text":"I always stop here when in Cleveland! This was a staple treat in a lovely neighborhood when I was a student nearby."}
{"text":"Every time I walk by I'm tempted to stop in for a slice of their pizza. It's cheap (less than $2) delicious (great cheese to sauce ratio), and a filling snack. If you want to make a meal of it, get a second slice or a side salad. 

Their tiramisu is mind blowing and all of the cookies are fabulous. Presti's is satisfying for pretty much any sweet or savory craving. Be careful though, some of the deserts are pricey and its easy to get swept away and order way more pastries, cookies, gelatos, salads, pastas than necessary."}
{"text":"Great selection of italian cookies, pastries, and cakes. I got a small box filled with random cookies that I picked out. I am not usually a fan of italian cookies but I definitely enjoyed eating most of them. The cannoli was creamy, heavy and delicious wrapped up in a crispy shell. I also had an italian iced tea dessert. It wasn't what I expected, but I liked it. It's essentially italian ice with iced tea drink poured over it. They ran out of lemon ice that day so I got mango which was yum. Presti's Bakery has a good reputation and the reality lives up to expectations."}
{"text":"Cleveland at it's best is when it's NOT TRYING to be Portland or NYC.
In context of what's around, it is actually one of the best places out here. Best because: most unpretentious, or least pretentious, whichever you prefer. 

Food is cheap, great for a student budget.
Since recently (?) you better watch out in particular ordering things like deserts using fresh cream, ice-cream, fruit salad, fish/chicken dishes or mayonnaise in salads.
Because very obviously some dishes are several days old.
Salmonella danger alert, level orange.

You can notice it if you get a fresh cheese cake with cherry on top and it has a crust, when it should be fluffy like a cloud and the fruit on top of it is chewy like a gummi bear, that means this item was born many days ago and is not safe consumed as food item.

If you see the tuna salad having brown dried edges on the tuna flakes, no matter where you see such a tuna salad actually, at Prestis or in your own fridge, do no longer eat it and also do not feed it to any of your pest you could get very sick.
Same counts for fruit salad that starts to decay, eating that one will counter act your best intentions to eat \"something healthy\".

Be your own judge, but don't blame me for yet again saying something unfavourable to a situation where Cleveland thinks (and promotes) it is \"rust belt chicque\" again.
.
According to numerous staff that have worked here, many of them cute art students from nearby CIA and also other unis in town, unfortunately they still keep up old Little Italy tradition and refuse employing African-Americans, although allegedly they will with a big smile take your application (and throw it straight in the bin, as I was told.) 

The minute that changes I am more than happy to add one more star.

Further: to those good people who do not realize what they're looking at: if you happen to sit in PRESTI'S (but the very same applies to other restaurants in Little Italy) and you are being approached by some very young children (at the time of writing maybe around 6, 7 years old? Who knows), asking you to buy a candy bar (the going rate at time of writing is $5) as a charity event for their school, do not buy from them. 
You can read up on this problem if you i.e. put in google search \"Candy Sales Another Form of Human Trafficking\" is one article, there are plenty describing the issue; if you are not sure ask the kids which school they are from, they might say \"Tremont\" (which is the other side of town) without naming a special school, ask for their permission; late at night you may see them at the bus stop to Mayfield (opposite of Tremont) with what seems to be their moms, possibly hear them discussing the hotel where they are intending to spend the night. 
Don't waste your time calling police, who will tell you there is nothing wrong with selling candy bars, or they might say, an officer was just out there and talked to the kids and there wasn't a problem, or they will ask you if you intended to create a problem for a seemingly single mom trying to earn a buck on the side for her family having her kids sell candy bars, or they will tell you, you are being presumptuous (all of these were told to me by police trying to report this, as it is suggested to do on sites that address this perhaps out here new problem that were maybe not written in Cleveland). 
In any case police can't be bothered, so maybe best do not nurture the issue by buying into it, that is IF you can be bothered."}
{"text":"Great service incredible pastries and food.  If you've ever been here, there's no need to explain 5 stars.  I've been a customer of theirs 30 years.  There is no substitute."}
{"text":"Ok I normally would say 4 stars but because the amount of chaos to have someone help you made me not want to return for a while. I like the pasties and desserts and they are pretty good but I timed it and I had to take a number (#11) and they were on #1. It took 25 mins for me to get a small box of cookies. They must have had at least 40 people standing around waiting to order or waiting for an order. There was only 5 people working behind the counter...seems fine right? But what I noticed is there was NO URGENCY what so ever by any of the counter staff. Next in the middle of the chaos of of the counter staff takes a large circular tray/plate to arrange cookies to take across  the street (maybe for a restaurant or something. She then walked them out and walked down the street. I wouldn't say that is the appropriate time to arrange a plate and do deliveries especially when the place is jam packed. It went to 4 people behind the counter. Might have been smarter to handle customers in store and have deliveries handled another way. Sorry but no cookies are worth 25 min wait. And they should drill their staff to serve a customer within 3 min. They would give much better customer service if they considered doing a retraining and changed it up a bit. I've been coming here for a few years and it's always the same. Time for a change"}
{"text":"rasberry linzer, raspberry linzer, rasberry linzer!

peanut butter cookies - oh yeah!

I'm in heaven.

Cream puff, I liked it, but maybe it's just me, I wan't impressed, but was impressed with its size. it's freaking huge.  quantity over quality?  maybe I'm just not a cream puff person. I dunno.

The food is quick and pretty good - being in little italy, there are some bigger contenders here, but for take out you get great portions and it's good.

Had the gnocchi and lasagna.  Lasagna wasn't cooked all the way through, but it was gigantic, so I can understand why.  simply had them heat it up more.
it was good. again, not the best in little italy, but in a pinch - it'll satisfy. 

The outdoor seating and ambience make it very casual and relaxing."}
{"text":"I love it here! It's in the middle of Little Italy. 

Their pizza by the slice is a great ratio of cheese to crust -- minimal topping, some sauce and a good crust.

The cannoli was crisp and the filling was the perfect amount of sweet ricotta cheese. Don't forget to try a chocolate mousse!"}
{"text":"Did you know Cleveland has an Italian neighborhood? It does. And in it is the beautiful and lovely Presti's. Yay donuts!!!"}
{"text":"The tiramisu is amazing.  5$ but delicious.  Honestly that piece is for one person but could share up to 2 maybe. The cookies are great but a little pricey at about 75 cents each.  The fruit tart at 5.50$ is delicious but also a bit pricey.  This place has excellent desserts.  Lots of good meal options closeby."}
{"text":"The pastries here are delicious, specifically the chocolate covered cannoli!! They are slightly pricey, otherwise I would have given them a 5 star."}
{"text":"Can't help but stop here for dessert no matter how crowded it gets.  A++ and a must go to for anyone with even the smallest sweet tooth.  My favorites include the chocolate dipped macaroons, cassata cake, and the cannolis.  The large glass windows at the store front and the outdoor seating provide a very welcoming atmosphere. People watching can be fun here."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I've eaten here a handful of times and have always had an exceptional experience. The desserts are second to none, with a special nod to the coconut macaroons and cream puffs. Every time I am in the area there is a required special stop at Presti's. The staff is friendly, professional, and attentive as well. I could not say a bad word about this place if I tried!"}
{"text":"You may have to wait in line, but this is the BEST bakery in Little Italy.  Their non-bakery is also quite good.  There is an area for eating, and the place is popular."}
{"text":"Best. Cannolo. Ever. I have literally never eaten a better one. And I've had them from the famous Mike's pastry in boston's north end, as well as Modern, which some think is better. Both pale in comparison to Presti's!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you take a number, there are no lines, just wait to be called out. The service is fairly quick. It was hoppin on a Saturday mid afternoon.

The bakery items are descent, not fabulous. I've been here a few times and if you have a sweet tooth, it isn't bad, just not really memorable or in my opinion, worth the calories. 

Today I needed a quick counter service meal and ordered the vege Stromboli. I would not suggest coming here to eat. Looking at the food, nothing looked special or jumped out at me. I kinda wish I hadn't bothered. The menu board said the Stromboli had \"spinach mushrooms olives and roasted red peppers.\" The olives were all together absent and the other three ingredients came from a freezer bag, can or jar. There was also a scant amount of ricotta cheese in there. It was blah."}
{"text":"Always crowded but never slow, their food is A*. Recommend the pizza bread, chocolate cannoli, and lasagna."}
{"text":"Best baked goods around! My out of town family specifically asks for their goodies and we're never disappointed. We recently had a death in the family and I stead of mourning we celebrated. I came in and purchased a large amount of baked goods and they were a hit at the celebrations of life. All of my out of town family wanted Canoli and that's what they got. The best darn Canoli around. What was meant to be a sad occasion was joyful because of family and food. Sounds weird to most but, to us. We gather and spend most of our time around the kitchen table talking about the passed and thinking about the future. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordering is a little confusing. They say \"take a number,\" but I can never find the stand where you take a number. I usually just walk to the counter instead if it isn't crowded.  Their pastries are incredible but don't pass up on their savory treats! We got a spinach and cheese loaf for $2! It was a steal! And very tasty. Parking is sort of difficult because the streets turn mostly into valet after 4 so beware of that!"}
{"text":"Presti's is a place that you have to go to if you're in Little Italy. There's a reason most people rave about it. I've been here around dinner time on weekends and most recently around lunch time during a week day. The good part about going during the week, especially before 3 or 4, is that you avoid the lines because yes, Presti is popular and there will be lines. There's a reason they tell you to grab a number.

However, despite how daunting a line you may encounter - it never takes long to get through it and the end result is worth the weight. The staff if cheerful, helpful and quick without making you feel rushed and unwanted. 

The cannolis are great - the shell is crispy (the ones covered in chocolate are extra amazing) and the cream is perfect. I came with a friend and she raved about it between bites. Their vast assortment of cookies are amazing. Because of its size, Presti's can afford to have a lot of variety so there will literally be something for everyone. I'm partial to their Linzer cookies, both the apricot and the raspberry. They're especially good when paired with their coffee. This time around I got a mocha which was a bit too sweet for my taste but that may have been because I downed two co okies with it so take that as you will. Next time I think I'd follow my friend's lead and grab a latte - still delicious but not sweet. 

Apart from the baked goodies there's also several options for lunch or dinner including strambolies, pizza, pasta, etc.. I eyed the Spinach stramboli but decided against it this time around. The strambolies have the perfect ratio of filling-to-bread so it was hard to walk away. I will be back though and that stramboli will be mine.

The interior of this place as a whole is unsuprisingly large. There are numerous tables where you can eat comfortably with a large group or just by yourself. I saw several people at individual tables sipping their coffees and working on their laptops. The entire front of the bakery is windows so the natural light is always there and always pleasant, especially on a good day. Or you could always grab a seat in their patio area out front. Not going to lie, sitting out there and watching the people walk by as I sipped my coffee and nibbled on my treat brought back the feeling of sitting at a cafe in Europe. It was bright and breezy and the people walking past spoke a mix of English and Italian. These same people, more often then not, popped inside to grab a coffee or pastry as well. When the locals stop by you know it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great cannoli and coffee.  Excellent atmosphere for a casual cup of Joe with some friends.  

I didn't have time to get the breakfast sandwich but needless to say they look amazing and they are about as big as your head.  The sausage on them looks much more substantial than your usual McMuffin.  If I had to place bets it was probably procured from a local butcher.  If I had more time I would have gotten one.

Finally, this is the place to take your kids if you want to spoil them with a real cookie.  They have your traditional Italian anise cookies right alongside chocolate chip and m&m cookies that are about the size of a personal pizza."}
{"text":"Oh Presti's and I go way back. One my first discoveries here in Cleve was this lovely little bakery. You walk on in and smell the sweet treats, paninis being pressed, and pizzas baked.  At first glance you will see pastries and goodies galore. Gelato, brownies, tiramisu, cookies all take up most of the counter. 

The staff are always nice and friendly, no matter how busy they get. It's quite busy at any time of day, especially during lunch hour. Grab a number because there is technically no line. This is how they create order out of the chaos. Then, you're free to walk around and get a glance at what you might want to order when your lucky number is called. 

So, these are my faves: 
Tiramisu
Stromboli (any- you can choose from a few different types)
Mango iced tea

I confess I usually just get these items, but I have tried other things and didn't like them as much. The food isn't amazing, but it's good. And I just love the atmosphere. Whether you're looking to grab some lunch or lounge around on a sunny afternoon for coffee & desserts, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Went for cannoli and sfogliatelle. Also picked up some pizza. Good stuff. I couldn't wait for the next feast. I dont often come this part of town."}
{"text":"If you unfortunately must have lunch at this establishment...get Tiramisu for dessert. I'm not going to tell you what to get for lunch. They're not worth mentioning.

Tiramisu should offer subtle, warm sweetness from the Mascarpone cheese and egg cream batch, balancing with the right amount of bitterness from espresso in the lady fingers and cocoa powder layer. 

If the cheese layer does not have a tint of yellow, that means the recipe removes the egg yolks. If using only egg white, yes it enables an airy body, but it's not worth it to lose that warmth that only the yolk renders.

It should NOT carry any sour taste, not even a hint - that means cream cheese is used. Cream cheese does not belong in Tiramisu. We're not making cheese cake here.

Whipped cream also should NOT be used. That's just lazy cooks attempt to create the illusion that the body is airy.

I make Tiramisu at home. Whenever there is a potluck occasion, the only dish I bring is Tiramisu. Hence you can say Tiramisu is the signature dish of my kitchen.

When I go to Italian restaurants, I used to always order tiramisu, just so that I can critique it. This includes restaurants IN Italy.

Presti's tiramisu is one of the rare few that reminds me of my own. There may be a little variation: I don't have electric mixer at home, AND I steam bain-marie the raw eggs in case of salmonella, so my Mascarpone cheese batch is denser. I usually make mine into 2 layers, whereas Presti's is one layer. For $5 worth of cost, mine is six times bigger than Presti's.

But since I can't feed the whole CLE yelper community with my masterpiece, get your fill at Presti's."}
{"text":"We stopped by after dinner for dessert. We had teramisou and a capochinno brownie. Presti's is has so many delightful deserts it's very difficult to choose. The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  The seating area inside is very conducive to conversation.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Their PIGNOLI COOKIES are bomb.com. Not your average chocolate chip cookie. Authentic Italian cookie with toasted pine nuts, an almond flour base (which provides a chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside), and powdered sugar dusted on top. I bring home boxes of these when I visit family for the holidays. I've tried getting an assortment of cookies (which they sell by weight) as gift for co-workers/friends/myself, but find myself digging around for the 1 or 2 pignoli cookies any way. Let's just cut to the chase. The other cookies are alright. Also a little on the pricey side, I think it's around $13 for a pound of cookies. Haven't tried their savory foods or gelato."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in CLE. I love almost everything at this place. The pizza is surprisingly awesome, the meatball and chicken parm subs are great and the pastries are the best. The staff is mostly nice and polite. Prices are low for high quality. Only complaint is the inconsistency with the order system. Sometimes you grab a number sometimes you don't. So to be safe always grab a number when you go in."}
{"text":"Second time in Cleveland, second time here.  My girlfriend and I always seem to hit up Presti's for breakfast once a trip.  It's so good.  It is exactly what you'd want and expect in an italian bakery.  Tons of options, all fresh out of the oven.  The service is quick and friendly and the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"A pleasant Spring afternoon brought us to Little Italy last Saturday. After walking up and down Mayfield and Murray Hill, we stopped at Presti's, a charming Italian bakery/cafe for lunch. 

Pizza, Stromboli, Antipasti, Italian Wedding Soup, Panetone, Gelato, Tiramisu, Macaroons, Biscotti, Cannoli, Cassata Cake, Espresso, Cappuccino & more. This place has it all.

I ordered a slice of sausage & pepper pizza. The sausage wasn't cut into little medallions or arranged in a nice neat fashion either. Envision an entire sausage link smothered with red and green peppers on top of the pizza. Eating it involved folding up the pizza like a hotdog bun and digging in. The idea was pure genius.

They also boast a charming outdoor seating area right outside the cafe and overlooking Mayfield Road. Serves as a great location for people watching."}
{"text":"I have been here once and they have great cannolis and lattes. Unfortunately, it's been very difficult going back and giving more business because they close far too early, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. My husband and I usually go to dinner around 8ish and by the time we are done, this place is closed or about to close. We can never go enjoy a cup of coffee and dessert after eating in Little Italy. We always look at the bakery as we're driving home pondering why they don't at least stay open till 11pm on Friday and Saturday nights. Seeing all the great reviews and pictures for lunch, I mentally added this place to my list of brunch places that my husband and I need to try out."}
{"text":"Oh so yum! How I wish I lived closer to Presti's. I've never tried anything but their desserts, but the desserts...I want them all, all the time. I'm a sucker for bakeries and this is truly as good as it gets. 

There's not even really much to say. Just go. You'll find so many things you want and it will feel like the hardest decision you've made since choosing between the Browns home opener or the Steelers game."}
{"text":"Good prices, delicious Italian food, overall a great place to grab something quick. I thoroughly enjoy their pizza, pizza bread, stromboli, and cannoli. Most of my experience with their food is through the Feast of the Assumption, but I've also eaten at the restaurant. It gets fairly loud, overwhelming, and crowded with people coming in and out, so I'd recommend getting your food to go and heading somewhere else if you can (in the summer, head to the park just a block away!)

If you can, go with someone who is familiar with it. Presti's is popular, so it's easy for a newbie to get overwhelmed. The number taker is at the first pole on your left. Find it and make a beeline for it, then scan their specials. Trust me, you'll be waiting long enough to decide.

Also, they don't constantly make more food throughout the day. They often run out of things (I was super bummed when they were out of the eggplant pizza), so if you see it on the chalkboard but don't see it in the display case, come up with a second choice; chances are they're out of it. The pizza they have available isn't in a display case--it's behind the register."}
{"text":"Gelato. Cannoli. Gealato. Let's see, did I leave anything out?
The Viennese and the French can bake pretty good pastries, but the Italians, as with all food, they are in a league of their own. 
I've been to Rome and plied the canals of Venice in a gondola. I've seen St. Peters and The Piata at the Vatican. But it's the food in Italy that makes for some of my fondest memories.
The French wouldn't know Spumoni if they had a shoe full of it.
Is Presti's the best bakery on planet Earth? Could very well be.  
Fogetaboutit, it's in Little Italy. Mange."}
{"text":"But really, I think Presti's was the best cannoli I've ever had in my life. Also, i've never had so many handsome men offer to hold the door for me (why I am not spending more time in Little Italy?), but, I digress. There's also a few free parking spots directly in front of the bakery (score!).

Presti's really does have it all. I love the high-energy environment and open space concept. When I visited, there was a wonderful mix of students, business folks on lunch breaks, and diverse and intergenerational people overall spread amongst the tables working, studying and having coffee chats. This immediately made my heart really happy to see so many different people coming together. When I walked in, I immediately grabbed a number and waited for it to be called. The cases were packed immaculately with everything-- cinnamon buns, cheesecakes, creme brulee, brownies, custard puff, cassata cake... literally anything you can imagine to entice you while you wait your turn.

It was a little busy when I visited, so I ended up getting a cannoli to-go while my friend opted for the cassata cake. There's probably not words to appropriately describe this cannoli-- but the filling was so fresh, creamy and unique. I feel like I could pick it out of a lineup. I tried a bite of my friends' cassata cake, and it was layered to perfection without being overly sugary. Sometimes cassata cake can be a lost art when the cream/frosting is a suger overload, but this one was perfect. Overall, I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here. But then again, has anyone ever gone to Little Italy and had a bad experience?! Come get yourself a treat, you deserve it."}
{"text":"People think that the slogan \"Cleveland Rocks\" revolves around the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  King James' Cavaliers? Nope. 

It's Presti's.

Throughout C-town's roller coaster existence, the boom and bust from Mistake on the Lake to the Birthplace of Rock and Roll, one neighborhood has enjoyed prosperity: Little Italy, with great restaurants and monster good bakeries.

The queen of the leavened, and now, I think, the only big one left, is Presti's. 

They've added sandwiches and remodeled a couple of times, but they've left the character of the place in-tact. More important, the baked goods are still AMAZING. 

Over three decades, they have been the saving grace of a bad trip to Cleveland Clinic; the point of discovery for my kids' college hunt summer trip a few years back; and a place of celebration for the youngest who capped off his discovery of how great Case Western Reserve University is with a macaroon and the most light delicious cloud-like tiramisu on the planet, over perfect espresso drinks.

To locals, who probably think that such places are the norm, don't take it for granted! They should tag the building with an endangered species tag. Gone are the greats in New York, a few remain in Chicago, and a handful here and there. 

For the tourist, whether you came to see Elton John's outrageous outfits, a basketball or baseball championship run, or just enjoy watching your NFL team bash the bumbling Browns, you MUST ditch the diet for a day and make Presti's a destination."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and never once had good service. The staff was always impatient with me, like they were doing me a favor! Even if the food was good, I couldn't bring myself to love this place too much."}
{"text":"Cafe mocha and coconut lemon cake.
Nothing like a sweet snack before supper.    
And,cookies to go."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! I haven't had a bakery item that I haven't enjoyed here.  My absolute favorite has to be the lemon biscotti.  I ordered 10 yesterday, and they are gone today...oops!  The cannoli also makes me feel like I'm back in Italy.

Make sure you take a number when you walk in the door.  Trust me, there will be plenty of people in front of you which will give you time to make your decision!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bakeries in Cleveland!  Have been coming here for years. Their pastries and desserts are the best.  The tiramisu is one of the best I have ever had, they offer plenty of flavors of delicious gelato during the summertime.  Smaller cookies are available by weight, which means you can get a decent amount of cookies to share at a very good price!  Prepared foods such as pastas, salads, sandwiches, and eggs are available for those wanting a quick meal.  The coffee is decent and I believe they offer refills for 25 cents.   

Presti's is very busy at certain times of the day but I have never had a problem or even that long of a wait because the staff are so friendly, helpful, and efficient.  

The bakery is charming on the inside and there are a number of tables available outside as well.  

Five stars to Presti's for their high-quality, delicious baked goods and other food, reasonable prices, great staff, and a nice atmosphere-- what more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"This tiramisu is the best!  Definitely one of the places I want to stop when I'm in Cleveland.  The bakery is full of delectable sweets and appetizing savory meal options as well.  Check this place out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Cute, well-lit, tasty-looking food in the display cases, polite staff.  BEST mini raspberry linzer cookie I've EVER had!!!  

Where are the other two stars?  Mediocre iced mocha - they made it in the wrong order:  espresso, chocolate, and milk should be mixed first, THEN ice added.  If you pour the espresso over ice, it becomes too diluted, and adding the milk afterwards means that you have a really watered-down drink with three mostly melted ice cubes in your drink.  Considering that it took the guy about 7 minutes to make my drink (no, literally!), I was a little unhappy with the result.

But, cuteness and good linzer cookies DOES make up for a plethora of ills, and did I mention that the lamp shades are TO DIE FOR?!!!!  I would definitely go back here, next time with a big appetite for some of what was in that display case!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for this being a place where you can get any meal, snack, or drink and it be fantastic. I've never met a pastry, cookie, or piece of pizza I didn't like here, and I've met a lot of the above! Though I've been rear-ended by those who aren't #blessed with parallel parking skills twice now, this place still has me coming back. Highly recommend: tiramisu, Napoleon, cream puff, cannoli, & coffee. Presti's over Corbo's any day/dessert"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for an interview at Case Western for lunch and had an overall satisfactory experience. I ordered the spinach and sausage stromboli (with marinara on the side), and shared a bread pudding. 

First thing I noticed upon walking in was the chaos. They follow the take-a-number system and this means a lot of yelling and squeezing through crowds of people when your number is called. They do have a wide assortment of foods, ranging from pastries to paninis to pastas and more. My stromboli was decent - flavors were a bit muddled and it was really oily, but I was satisfied with my purchase. I definitely recommend that you get the marinara sauce on the side. The bread pudding was rather bland! I appreciate that it wasn't sickly sweet, but I don't eat dessert for bland flavors... so that was disappointing. 

One thing that I do love about this place is the pricing. Lunch for two (2 strombolis and a dessert to share) came out to $11-12, which is unheard of for me (I can easily pass amount for just myself). 

Would I visit again? Maybe. Especially if I were a student in the area, I'd say this is a great place to visit for decent, cheap eats."}
{"text":"My favorite little italy bakery. Love the whole experience of visiting. Mini cheesecakes w fruit topping...mmmmm"}
{"text":"I've been going to Presti's for years, so Thanksgiving weekend provided the perfect time to stop in.  We had dined at Trattoria and walked down the street to Presti's on Friday night.  We wanted to order both pastries and coffee, which you had to do in two separate lines.  I waited for the pastries and ordered for a couple of people.  When I asked if the pastries could be put in separate boxes, the lady behind the counter seemed to get huffy with me.  When I paid, I was holding my adorable four month old niece, so she seemed to chill out.  I got the pumpkin cheesecake on this visit, and it was fantastic.  I'm glad to see that Presti's is still thriving after so many years."}
{"text":"When I discover a city has a Little Italy neighborhood, my number one priority is to get my hands on a cannoli. Whether it's Boston,  Baltimore, or Cleveland, it's an absolute must (this is serious business people). 

Cleveland's Little Italy is a lively place on Saturday night, so we had to fight for a parking spot and a place in line at Presti's. Luckily there were plenty of employees to help us out and make it a fun experience. Even though it was a bit of a hassle, that crunch of the pastry and sweet creamy ricotta was totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Visited after lunch on Fri 11/17.  Very crowded so we grabbed our number and waited while peering at the tremendous selection of cookies, pastries, pies, and cakes.  There really is something for everyone.  Our party of 7 each had something different including creme brûlée, cheesecake,  assorted cookies, chocolate croissant, and brownies.  Also had espresso and cappuccino.  Everything that passed my lips was delicious.  Parking was tight in the area, and the wait was long, but we ultimately enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and the pastries/cakes are to die for! The service is great even when they're very busy. Cavatelli with meatballs and cucumber and tomato salad are just 2 of their many great options. The prices are very good for the quality!"}
{"text":"We dropped by during the Feast of Assumption and it was packed! The wait was well with the delicate and delicious pastry! The fresh fruit cheesecake is very fluffy and semi-sweet -- which is how I like my cheesecake. The cannoli had a nice crunch and deliciously sweet filling! I'll definitely be back to the everything else!

Price is reasonable for sure. Just make sure you take a number and listen for it when they call it out :)"}
{"text":"Presti's can be really hit or miss. It's definitely the most popular bakery in little Italy but it's a little overpriced and I haven't enjoyed all of the bakery items I've tried. I would definitely suggest sticking to the cassata cake, cannolis or their assortment of Italian cookies, which seem to be pretty consistent in quality. They do have a wide range of food items including baked sweets, gelato, hot drinks and hot prepared food and they are a convenient dessert stop if you are grabbing dinner in little Italy."}
{"text":"Epic cannoli- the filling has a creme fraiche consistency, isn't overly sweet, and the texture is perfectly contrasted with the flaky pastry casing. The stromboli, pizza, and prepared foods here are also excellent. Presti's is one of the best places in Cleveland, and the reason the Little Italy in this city is among the best and most authentic Italian Villages in the country."}
{"text":"Presti's is great for getting some good dessert.  The selection of Italian sweets is extensive, and they also sell fresh bread.  Their entrees are just ok.  Most of them are pre-made, so they just reheat them for you when you order, which can make any pasta dishes taste a little overcooked.  As for beverages, I like the fact that they have aranciata and limonata at their beverage counter on the side.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The treats are tasty and its an obvious place to schedule a meetup if you're in the area. BUT, its often packed and the take a number system can be confusing. People don't realize they need one, then don't hear their number called when they do have one, and, when its me, I'm totally unprepared when my number gets called... I'm stuck staring at the huge display case of goodies thinking I should have browsed the selection first then pulled a #.

Sorry vegans, we weren't able to find anything vegan on our most recent trip."}
{"text":"One of the best pastry places I have visited. Absolutely love their tiramisu, creme brulee and cheesecakes. Their cappuccino and biscotti are a must have. Good options for vegetarians. Their basil pesto and sun dried tortellini are mind blowing. Also love the vegetarian stromboli. Would really recommend this place for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"So I popped in on a sunny Sunday afternoon to get baked goods to go, and the place was PACKED. Which is great, I love to see it. I took a number and was served within minutes with polite, prompt service. For 3 large chocolate cannolis, I paid $9, which is reasonable considering how tasty they were. There appeared to be TONS of seating in a large, brightly lit, cheerful room. I'll be back to sample more of the food and maybe snag a seat by the window."}
{"text":"Growing up Presti's was the spot for donuts.  It's so much more now.  Prepared pastas, pizza slices, gelato, pastries.  I'm not sure what they do best now.  That's probably the only problem I have with them.  That being said they do a lot of things very well."}
{"text":"I love this place. The perfect lunch spot. Great bread. Great pastries."}
{"text":"Whatever you do here---you MUST get the coconut chocolate macaroons. They are delicious! And I don't even like macaroons! They have some pretty amazing dessert-but those are by far the best. 

Prestis is also great for weekend breakfast--crossaint sandwiches which are, of course, deliciously unhealthy. Good lunch variety too which is fresh and changes frequently---some of the sandwiches are just average but I've never had anything bad!"}
{"text":"Presti's is my favorite institution in little Italy in Cleveland! I absolutely love their pizza by the slice! You must get the pepperoni/sausage or the artichoke-white pizza, they are both unique! When they have egg plant Parmesan, get it as it's amazing! All the other savory foods are very good. The Pastries are a thing of rare beauty & happiness! The atmosphere there is a mixture of everything I love about University Circle/ Cleveland Heights!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Cleveland and I was told that this is one of the must-visit places while I am here.

I walked in and took a look at the pastries.  They all looked so good!  Prices weren't bad, but I guess the quality of the food made up for the higher price.

The nice girl at the counter asked me if I wanted something and was really nice and answered all of my questions.

She was really nice and suggested that I have one of them heated as she said that it was the best way to enjoy them.

The raspberry mousse was amazing.  The cheesecake was also very good.  I still have a creme brulee that I have yet to try, but that won't sit around for long.  I also had this interesting pastry with a name that I can't pronounce or remember how to spell, but it has a crispy exterior and an interior made of ricotta cheese, cream and bits of candied fruit (the type that you would find in fruitcake).  That pastry wasn't the best, but the rest of the stuff was amazing!"}
{"text":"If you have sweet tooth, then this is the place for you. Love the creme brûlée, cannoli and macaroons. It is my favorite place for a quick sweet dish whenever I visit little Italy with my friends. The service is remarkable as the ladies behind the counter often offer their assistance and they make sure customers are well catered to. If you are near campus do visit this place for a bit of great pastry. You won't regret it. I would recommend it from my heart to my sweet tongue"}
{"text":"The best cannolis!  Can't go to university circle without stopping for one!  My brother has even run from the corner alley to get us one.  Better cannolis than corbos."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with Presti's... I go because everyone claims it's amazing but it's super crammed and the number system doesn't really work. They microwave their pastas and sandwiches so it's not fresh. They have a great variety of baked goods but I'd prefer The Stone Oven or Luna's bakery for that. I had their egg and cheese croissant and was super disappointed because the bread was NOT flaky and the cheese was the very cheap kind. Presti's is also more expensive than Luna's and stone oven, but their quality is not worth it. Will say they do have a huge variety which I think makes the place so great and lots of space for studying."}
{"text":"Pastries that you make googley eyes at with your mouth open and Stromboli in three or four  recipes. Just awesome and a great selection of Italian pasta dishes ready to eat at great prices I'm from Wichita KS but this place is so good it's worth a trip to Cleveland just to eat here it's a great casual dining experience in the heart of little Italy in Cleveland OH."}
{"text":"I have been during little Italy festival. Their cannoli and tiramisu are to die for. Parking was a problem. If not for that this restaurant is perfect."}
{"text":"Pastries, cookies, gelato, cakes, breads, pizza, pasta, coffee, tea, etc etc etc. Pretty much you can go here any time of the day for various Italian foods. I love the cannolis. They also have mini tarts and cheesecakes and other cakes/desserts that are adorable and delicious. And you can get small cookies (at least a dozen different varieties) by weight. I'm a sucker for things that are mini. The place has kind of an old/homy feel (maybe it is old), it's pretty busy when I've been there, and the lines can get pretty long, goes to show it's been around a while and it is very popular."}
{"text":"Desserts were great! They used have great coffee terrible now though. But I gotta have those fresh desserts just going to skip the java."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza
Amaretto Lobster Tail
Sfogliatelle
Cannoli
Lemon Biscotti, Slivered Almond Cookie, Pignoli, Nut Horn, Turtle Cookie, Helen's Date Nut Bar, Raspberry Thumbprint

Located at 12101 Mayfield Road, just a few hundred yards from Corbo's and the rest of Cleveland's Little Italy, Presti's Bakery has long been a favorite of neighbors, tourists and Case Western Reserve University students,  the family-run space originally founded in 1903 most certainly having withstood tough times, yet still doing great business.

Sizable in its selections as well as its seating options, a lack of the latter admittedly a problem at its nearby competitor, entry to Presti's sees diners confronted by nearly one hundred selections both sweet and savory, everything from Pizza and Pasta served as early as 6am with Pastries rolling out all day to replete diminishing favorites.

Using an old-school ticketing system, many diners unaware and thus delayed in placing their order at the counter as they are redirected to the red device on a poll, it was after a bit of perusal that most composed an order by way of ever-patient servers, a total of eleven pieces comprised mostly of cookies delivered in boxes and paper trays at the end of a $16 tip and tax inclusive assortment.

Approaching 10:30am, essentially lunch hour taking the day's plan as a whole, dining began with a flimsy slice of square Pizza that strongly resembled something from a Highschool cafeteria, even after rewarming, all but a few bites discarded before progressing quickly to the pre-filled Cannoli, the Mascarpone filling smooth and sweet, but the shell already besieged by sogginess.

Happy to again see Sfogliatelle, small bits of Fruit giving this iteration a leg up on Corbo's despite a shell that was not quite as springy and shattering, best bites of the meal were found in the lightly Almond scented Lobster Tail piped full of Cream filling, the Date Bar and Pine Nut Pignoli also highly praiseworthy while the Nut Horn and Slivered Almond Cookie each begged for something more than water to combat a texture that was more dry and stale than nutty and crumbly."}
{"text":"First of all, the glass front of this eatery is awesome.  I love being able to see inside as I walk down the street or people-watch as I eat a cannoli.  The store is always clean and the staff is quite friendly.  The items are displayed beautifully and have flavors to match.

Presti's is a great place to stop for lunch, dinner, or a desert."}
{"text":"If you're in Little Italy, there a plethora of delicious choices for lunch and or dinner - but no matter where you go, skip the desert and make a quick walk over to Presti's and grab one [or 12] cannolis.  I've had cannolis in Italy, and those from Presti's are right up there with any you could get in Europe.  Presti's cannolis are absolutely perfect in every single way: perfectly creamy and not-too-sweet filling and the perfect crusty shell....as I describe this, I'm getting super bummed out I live 45 minutes away and can't grab one right now. Anyway, I digress - if you heading to Little Italy, grab lunch or dinner at one of the amazing restaurants and then you best be gettin' your cannoli on at Presti's."}
{"text":"Great \"slice of life\" bakery in the heart of Little Italy. Stopped in mid-afternoon after visiting the art museum.  The place was still bustling, but the counter staff were all very pleasant.  It was an impossibly tempting set of choices but I went with the Napoleon and a cafe au lait,  Despite a little bargaining with myself in the direction of restraint, I pretty much devoured the pastry.  It was wonderful and a little unusual compared to other Napoleon's I've sampled, and, yes, I know: I had a French pastry in an Italian bakery.  My tummy knows no borders.  But at any rate the pastry layers were light and flavorful.  The interesting thing is that the  creme pâtissière was a rather substantial custardy layer, not especially elegant but very delicious.  It gave me the strength to walk up from Murray Hill back into my home turf in Coventry!  A must-visit in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Presti's rules!!! Seriously! Family owned and operated for generations. 

Presti's has changed locations over the years to become more \"acceptably modern\" yet still maintains the original vision, traditions and foods."}
{"text":"During the Feast my family and I stood in a long line to get Gelato only afterwards to see the the tubs were Blue Bunny ice cream. I spent $30 for 6 small single scoops of ice cream. As I attempted to take photos I was threatened. Although a few years have passed I'm still furious."}
{"text":"Cute, very cute. Cute little place in the middle of Little Italy.

My friend and I were on the search for dessert after having a nice dinner (and I can't help it, I'm addicted to sugar). He suggested Presti's...so sure, why not, off we went. 

I walked in and was surprised at the assortment of pastries and food that welcomed you, all sitting in their nice little glass cases. We ordered a tiramisu to split- I got coffee to pair, him the hot chocolate, and sat down and enjoyed our dessert. It was a good tiramisu- One of my faves! He even got me to grab a spinach focaccia (or whatever it is..one of those bread pockets filled with spinach and cheese?) out the door for my lunch the following day...and man, THAT's good.  I highly recommend that...

Overall though, cute little bakery/cafe in Little Italy that's worth taking a stop at if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A little pricey but yummy deserts. Seriously, most of the cookies/deserts were pretty good! In the summer, they also serve gelato, which was pretty good in my impression.

I never ordered their food there because I am just not a fan of ordering cold slammy food.. I don't know how long the food has been sitting there either and I don't think I've seen anyone ordering it either.

It's a self serve place so you just pay and get your food. Then you can either leave or find a table to dine in. The waiters are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pros:
- You gotta try the cannoli if you go. They are just terrific! I'm sure the other baked options are great as well. They looked very good.
- My family and I had a spinach bread, cheese pizza, sausage sandwich, and coffee. The food is simple but definitely above average.
- Outdoor patio is very comfortable, as is the inside if you prefer some air conditioning on a hot day.

Cons:
- Nothing food related - if I had to pick a con, it would be that the bathroom is small - but it's a bakery, so no big deal.

Overall: a terrific casual spot for a meal and an outstanding dessert."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, as far as Italian bakeries go they know what they're doing.  I love that they serve lunch and provide a variety of options through the week, pizza, stromboli, pasta, pasta salads, all very solid.

Three stars due to service.  We went on a  Wednesday for lunch and I waited as the next in line for 10 minutes for my number to be called.  10 minutes in line easily feels like 30, especially when you're on your lunch break.  They have it set up that one employee serves one ticket from order all the way through checkout, it's a very inefficient process during peak hours.  I consider myself very patient as I used to be a waiter, but I was really close to walking out, especially when the employees started bickering about tips.  Finally, when I was ready to check out my server had to wait for the sole cash register as it was being used by another employee.  As Marcus Lemonis would say, the process is broken.

I recommend the food, but I doubt I will return, I can't give up that much of my lunch hour just waiting...."}
{"text":"You know the convincing \"it's so hard to choose\" face The Bachelor always gives during rose ceremonies? Well they practice that face trying to choose a Prestis dessert. 

The counter is packed with unbelievably delicious looking cakes, cookies, and pastries, not to mention a Gelato selection. After careful consideration I went with a (gigantic) slice of casada cake. It was so good I don't even shudder using the word 'moist' to describe it. In a group of 4 people with 4 different desserts, none of us left anything short of stuffed and satisfied.

The joint can get busy. Definitely grab a number ticket at the door and listen to be called, they go quick. Sometimes when it's super packed they'll help people paying faster with cash separately, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Real good Italian pastry shop in Cleveland's Little Italy. Friendly staff and  good coffee. Get a cannoli!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! We chose a variety of goodies and they were all so Good! The Hubby's favorite was the tiramisu. My favorite was the canolli. And we both loved the pecan Brownie. We would recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's best Bakery's ever I've always loved this place . They have a variety of pastry's , and salads entrees like Veal Cutlet etc . Great coffee, expresso what ever coffee or tea you like your sure to find it here. My favorite is the Cannolis! Yummy ! Nice outdoor seating and friendly staff who could ask for more!"}
{"text":"I love these date and nut bars. Please, bring some home and enjoy them with Earl Gray or Chai tea. Oh dates, why do I cherish thee? Well. Squeezed into these unpretentious little squares are the soft crunch of walnuts hugged by mildly sweet dates..creating a combination of a most craveable chew, best enjoyed between sips of creamed tea. The dates almost taste of chocolate. When I was a kid, we could only get these around holidays.. I cannot stress how special these are to me. Enjoy them morsel by morsel, a small bite at a time.

Handsome brought a bag of these date bars and a box of some Napoleons, something also known as \"Mille Feuille\" or a Thousand Pages in other places. What was special about these was a filling of choco-creme and layers that stayed wafery and delicate. Great with coffee. Case closed.

Next case.
If the question is where, my answer is 
Presti's. For cannolis dark chocolate covered and satisfyingly crisp..these cannolis. These.

And Kolaches? Yes. Too. But only if you love me. 

Sometimes, when faced with a great array of choices, we feel the pressure of making the right selection, no whammy.

This is how I feel when I find myself in a bakery, the one place I can see my food preassembled in decadent form. I wasn't there when Handsome chose this home-run combination. I could only imagine what it must've been like, eyes darting about, aiming to please...

Well, Bullseye.

Five stars.. because the last parcel that came from here was everything I could've ever ever wanted."}
{"text":"I can at least say that the food here was great. We had their egg and cheese croissant sandwiches and I purchased a few sweet things to go, some cookies and macaroons, all delicious.... but the service, goodness gracious, it was awful. We stood in line for literally a half an hour before we could place our order. They had a number dispenser but half of the staff was calling numbers and half of them weren't. Behind the counter seemed completely disorganized and they only had one register running during the breakfast rush on a Sunday! Most of the workers were just standing around not even helping people! One lady kept yelling out, \"if you're paying in cash I can help you\", so I stepped forward and started placing my order and she ignored me, looked right past me and yelled, \"Oh Melvin good to see you again, hows the family\" Clearly she preferred the business of her regular customer rather than I, a tourist. It was so freaking rude. Finally when I got to place my order I wasn't even finished making my order and she started having a conversation with a coworker! Seriously, WTF was wrong with this woman. Then it took forever for them to heat up the sandwiches. Their food may be good but their service and organization needs a serious overhaul. Maybe that's a typical Italian Deli for you, I don't know. But in the great state of Indiana, we have manners."}
{"text":"Thank God for bakeries like Presti's and Corbo's!  I might not be able to survive living in Cleveland if not for these two places.  I was never a fan of cannoli's and neither places have converted me.  But everything else is GREAT!

Presti's has a nice gelato section and savory foods section as well.  Their bread selection is pretty good too, but I definitely go for the coconut chocolate cake and the sfogliatelle.  They have a massive cream puff as well - largest cream puff I've ever seen.  Also, I never cared for tiramisu, but their's is quite airy and smooth with a good amount of chocolate coating and a not too overwhelming rum flavor.  The cookies are pretty decent.  

Skip the coffee!  (they can't be good at everything)

Don't forget to take a number (red dispenser is on the pillar on your left, right when you walk in the door).  I didn't know the first time and after figuring out what I wanted, I realized I had to take a number and wait all over again."}
{"text":"I imagine Presti's is the kind of place you fall in love with as a kid - big lights, big glow, big pastries, big bread, big slices - but nostalgia is what keeps you coming back more than the quality of the food. We came here for lunch on a rainy Saturday. The service is by number at the counter, which is a bit chaotic as the counter is long and orders can be taken at any point along the counter, assembled, and then funneled down to one of the cash registers. You might think there is a line, but that is not the case. Thankfully, the staff taking your particular order will call your number LOUDLY and get the process started. The food and pastry offerings are longer than the counter; if it's even remotely Italian, they have it for you. We ordered chicken piccata, broccoli salad, pizza sausage, and cassata and an apple turnover for dessert. Liked the desserts, fresh crust on the pizza and the pasta/pizza sauce- all mainly because these items are easy to make ahead and they get a little better with time. Not so with the chicken and the sausage - the piccata sauce and pasta were gummy from the steam table and the sausage dry from being reheated. The broccoli salad was good, but the florets were huge and cutting raw broccoli with a butter knife is awkward at best. It is a lot of food, though - so we definitely ate our fill on what we did prefer. Great place to come with family who have varied tastes and/or for a decadent dessert, but next time, we'd just stop in for dessert and an espresso to go."}
{"text":"Presti's is one place I try to visit every time I visit family in Cleveland. It's always been amazing, and quintessentially \"Cleveland\" 

Today was just a profoundly sad day.  Took my parents there today before returning to Chicago.  We got there and the wait was painfully slow for service. That, I get.  But when there are other employees behind the counter who are taking down the showcase (where the food is) getting ready to close up, that's when it becomes infuriating. 

Half the menu was unavailable (they claimed to have absolutely no panini which is what we came for), and everything else in the case was sparse. Oh, and any restaurant that uses a microwave period, is really not a place worth visiting. 

Thank God I didn't order an espresso. I saw the way they were made for the people in front of me, and it was terrible.  From the way it came out of the basket, it was either too sour, or too bitter (I spent $5k on a machine for my house, trust me, I know espresso). Today's staff just didn't care. 

Goodbye Presti's.  Too bad.  You had a great reputation.  You blew it. A great tradition, blown to hell."}
{"text":"Tried a couple pastries here and it was okay.  Napoleon was disappointing.  Usually I love napoleons but this was a bit soggy and it didn't taste very good.  The tiramisu was not bad but not great, though it was better than the napoleon.

(There are really good napoleons at Vera's at West Side Market.)"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the dessert section of Presti's as it's our go to bakery when in little Italy. The cannolis are always on point and never overly sweet which is exactly what I look for. The gelato is flavorful and a great texture, so don't be afraid to grab a few flavors and split among your group.

There is a large selection of Italian baked goods where there is something for everyone. Each time we've been there the baked goods are always fresh and what you would expect from an Italian cookie or cake. 

The line moves quickly and is ticketed so you can move around to explore before you are called. If you are in the area, I would definitely suggest stopping by for a dessert."}
{"text":"A bit pricy for Cleveland bakery, but I LOVE the fig thingies, I go there just for those guys. Grab a coffee to go and off I am to the art museum. :)"}
{"text":"Presti's never ever disappoints. Cheap food ($1.50 for a piece of pizza), and fantastic quality. Casual dining, great atmosphere. Stromboli, cannoli, EVERYTHING is yummy. Cons? None, but always take a number when you come in for fast service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new places that my boyfriend has introduced me too! I have been wanting pumpkin pie for a week! Then we walk in and they have it! Heaven! Just the right amount of spices! I loved the coziness of this place too!"}
{"text":"The place was crazy crowded with people not understanding the whole deal about taking a number and then calling numbers. They had taken numbers but then they felt that there was some reason that they still needed to put their nose against the glass. Whatever. I got my number and took a seat.

Presti's isn't just a bakery but that's why I was here. They still have a big deli counter of sandwiches and salads and other ready-to-eat delicious looking things. Lasagna? Pasta salad? Tomato mozzarella salad? Fruit salad? All looked delicious.

But I was here for the baked treats. So many to choose from. Brownies (coconut, peanut butter and regular chocolate), cream puffs, eclairs, almond horns, all sort of tastiness! I went with a simple canoli and a handful of Linzers (apricot and raspberry). Heavenly!"}
{"text":"The best tiramisu I have ever eaten!  Especially when paired with an espresso."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the area of Little Italy I always have to stop in at Presti's! My family and I love all the desserts they have to offer and the gelato there is authentic and rich- just like it is offered in Italy! The staff really knows what they are doing and are helpful to the people who come in and out of the store."}
{"text":"Their food is excellent. I'm from San Francisco and whenever I'm in town I try and visit."}
{"text":"Awesome tasty desserts, my family has been going here for decades. I can't think of one negative thing to add. If you want Italian this is the place, right in the heart of little Italy."}
{"text":"Opened until 10 pm on a Saturday. Place is bustling at 9 pm. Not an available seat in the place. Got desserts at the counter. Was fast and efficient. Good selection. Coconut macaroons were delicious. So fresh."}
{"text":"Get a pignoli cookie; you'll thank me, unless you're allergic to pine nuts and/or almond flour, in which case, get another cookie, and still thank me.  :)"}
{"text":"This last year I lived on Murray hill so presti's was a quick walk away. I've been there at many different times and each time was at a different point in the day. No matter when I have gone, I always had a fantastic experience. The staff is always friendly and they are willing to do anything for their guests. For meals, I have gotten the meat Stromboli and I have gotten the chicken Parmesan meal that comes with the chicken, a salad, a role, and pasta. Both were outstanding. Now for the desserts, I have had so many different things! All are delicious but my favorite dessert has to be their cannolis- a must get! Presti's is a fantastic gem in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Good food priced right.  So the service is not stellar.  Great lunch, beverages and great pastries for 3 less than $28.  Nice neighborhood vibe, nice outdoor seating.  A great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Presti's offers a great assortment of cookies and pastries.  We tried their chocolate covered cannolis, various cookies, and cassata cake.  All were very fresh and tasted great.  The cassata cake was so moist that it blended nicely with the layers of custard inside.  Our only disappointment was the selection and quality of the gelato.  We've had better in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch and lunch.  Great desserts, great for kids too, wonderful frozen treats as well"}
{"text":"Great cookies, great canoli, great coffee.Large selection of beautiful desserts and lunch itmes.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Italian sandwich was so dry and bread was unremarkable. Had to doctor up the sandwich with as many condiments as possible. Cappuccino was terrible. 

Pastries were delicious. Loved the cannoli and the cakes! Yum yum, only reason to go there."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place, and lemme tell ya, it's nice having such a great bakery within a few hundred feet of my front door. If you ever come to my house and there's no Presti's Italian bread on our kitchen table, chances are that I'm heading down the street to pick up a new loaf. It's a great multi-purpose bread--makes great toast and is awesome for grilled cheese and other sammies, as Rachael Ray would say. 

They have a lot of ready-made food that is a good deal--you can get a huge sammy with lots of Italian meats for a few bucks. Their pepperoni bread is fantastic too--it's a meal in itself! 

Their desserts are awesome as well--I like to surprise my wife with a sweet treat every now and then, and Presti's has a wide variety of desserts ranging from ice cream to baked goods. 

I've got two complaints about the place--one major, one minor. You want the major one first? OK. The service can be very slow at times...I would hate to spend more time waiting to be served than I would driving or walking to\from Presti's! Some people take *so* long to order there...seriously, pick out what you want BEFORE you get in line, darnit! Also, if you need an outlet while you're there, get ready to play Indiana Jones in order to find one...there is like one outlet for use in the seating area. This is a big reason why we don't go there to study...and I can imagine that other university types who need to plug in their lappytops would find this frustrating as well.

BTW, if you're a Case old-timer who thinks that Presti's is the late-night donut shop and is planning to return to the site that fueled your late nights of studying during undergrad, I hate to burst your bubble, but this isn't it...unfortunately. The late night donut shop, which was up the street, is now closed. That place was legendary, and it's truly a shame that neither it nor Gilly's (which took over in the same location later on) is now open."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the area I stop here for some take out pastries. It takes me almost two hours to get here but it is well worth the trip. You"}
{"text":"The food is good if you want something different around the area.  Of course, it's more of a bakery type setting, so a lot of times, the food is preheated, but is great nonetheless.  I wish however, that they'd have balsamic vinegrette for the Caprese salads.  

Other than the saltier entrées, everything else is amazing, and the cassatta cake is legendary.  Great for when you're on a budget."}
{"text":"The line was way too long for mediocre desert items. The brownie cookie looked great but tasted okay. I wouldn't come back here."}
