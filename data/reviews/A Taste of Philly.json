{"text":"After a few write ups, I went and checked them out. Small sandwhichs for the price and not that great of one either."}
{"text":"Tried this one based on a comment from the Yelp message board.

The place was easy to find.  I was familiar with the area it was in since I used to work in the office building at University Place.  

When I walked in, many of the menu items were crossed off and there's a sign saying \"New Menu Coming\".  Apparently experimentation with some menu items didn't quite work.  I'll give that to them.  It's tough trying to find what works.

So I agree this place is a little expensive.  $6 for small 6 inch cheesesteak is a little steep.  But it was good and so far the best I've had in Charlotte.  

The roll itself looked like ones I'm used to cheesesteaks coming in.  The meat is sliced onsite and you can walk down the line to watch them make your cheesesteak.  I didn't see the option of adding sauce to the sandwich and I didn't ask.  This must be a Berks County (PA) thing where sauce was added to cheesesteaks.  

Around the restaurant....it's decorated with pictures of things from Philadelphia.  The staff were wearing Phillies caps.  

The bad things were that none of the booths were clean when I went to sit down.  Also, many of the napkin dispensers on the tables were empty but at least they used napkins made from recycled paper.  That's a plus.

So I'll give them some time to work out the kinks and then I'll hopefully be back.  After all I rarely get to this side of town but maybe next time I'm up at IKEA, I'll stop here again."}
{"text":"I can say this is the best place to get a cheesesteak in town.  Great atmosphere too.  Owner will come make sure everything is good if he is there.  It is not cheap but it's worth it.  Their fried pickles are good too.  Great fries! They have vinegar in spray bottle for the fries."}
