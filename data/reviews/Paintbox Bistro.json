{"text":"Terrible - How would you like to bite into your sandwich and have HAIR in it??  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my wife... To be fair, there is no parking. a public lot attached to the building jack up the price for the dinner crowd. The food was nice, all four bites. 

I was asked if I wanted water seven times... staff were tinkering with lights, they finally lit the candle on the table ... and then they changed the candle... (Stop fidgeting)

so what did I have...

(13) Prawn Ceviche + peach relish + crispy wonton (3 small prawn)
(18) Flank Steak + smoked potato puree + artichokes + whiskey jus 
(7) Festival + ginger maple glaze + vanilla cardamon cream

As I said the food was nice (very nice), at these prices I would have expected so much more. This is second year George Brown Fair...

I'm sure these growing / start-up challenges will be addressed by the managers if not Regent Park will finally get a Starbucks.

...as for my two stars... Meh. I've experienced better... I want this to be a four stars the next time I eat there..

I'll wait a while and go again this Bistro has outrageous potential and it's within walking distance of Chez Myhouse...

I picked up some Chinese on the way home I was so hungry...

This place seats about 60, when I arrived, two patrons were enjoying the fair, so when I was asked if I had a reservation... well at the time no but now maybe.

I did not see any Scotch in the bar, I may have missed it..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and was disappointed both twice with their modern spin. The hot chicken sandwich was barely even a sandwich at all, it was literally just one piece of bread with stewed shredded chicken on it. There was no slice on top, making very hard to eat. As for the chicken itself, it was bland and resembled something out of a Chunky's Soup can.

However this place has a great atmosphere and friendly staff, so it's probably good for coffee/dessert"}
{"text":"Beautiful day yesterday, so I recommend this place for my brother and I to have lunch. When we got there we decided to eat out on the patio, and we assumed it was open because two people were already out there. We walked from inside the restaurant to the patio. (Just also want to note that we passed a lady sitting at one of the tables extremely focused on her computer. Naturally because we weren't acknowledged we assumed that she was a customer.) That was a big mistake! We sat there for awhile and no one came out to serve us. I suggested to my brother that maybe we should go somewhere else, but he said \"let's just go inside.\" When we went inside, he asked the lady behind the counter if customers are being served, she said that they don't do table service anymore and that the kitchen is going to be closed in 10 minutes (it was 2:30 in the afternoon), but said he we can order off the quick menu. We ordered two hamburgers with salad. Came up to almost $30.00. We sat at one of the tables and waited for our meal, which took 20 minutes to come. Actually, our burgers were sitting in the pickup area for at least 5 minutes before the lady who took our order went and put the salads together. When she came with our food, she apologized for telling us that the kitchen closed in 10 minutes because she thought it was almost 3:30pm. Also, while waiting for our food the lady that was sitting at her table doing computer work got up and went into the back area and started talking to the ladies and two male servers  whom had just arrived from one of their private functions. Also have to say that while we were waiting a group of three friends came in and sat on the patio and were served. Needless to say, we weren't impressed with the service. Walked in no one greeted us or served us, the lady cared more about her computer than her customers, we were told that the kitchen closes in 10 minutes when it had over 1 hour before closing. The experience was not consistent in which I would call great customer service. This place has the potential to do extremely well in and around the community, but without great customer service, the food will not matter because people would rather go elsewhere and spend their money.  Lastly, the food is overpriced for what we got and my brother threw up in the night."}
{"text":"On a whim, my wife and I paid a visit to Paintbox Bistro for a Saturday brunch.  It looked like a fun, quirky place from the outside, and the atmosphere inside was pleasant and seemed to capture the spirit of the Daniels Spectrum building to which it's attached -- lots of light, room enough to eat in peace, and good music.  

Unfortunately, the questionable service and excessive waiting for our food spoiled our experience.  

I'm not usually one to complain about wait times for service in restaurants -- I understand that peak hours and short-staffed establishments require a degree of patience on the part of the patron.  However, waiting 40 minutes for a simple Caesar salad is beyond excessive.  Oh, our server sort-of apologized for the snail's pace -- you see, they hadn't anticipated so many patrons.  On a Saturday.  On the first day of Doors Open 2013, with the Daniels Spectrum being one of the participating venues.  Give me a break.  Midway through the wait for our food, a second server grumpily approached us to ask if we had been served yet, naturally at a loss as to why we had been sitting there for 20 minutes with nothing but water.  And maybe he was just confused as we were that the kitchen counter (visible from our table) had several finished dishes waiting to be served but just sitting there.  Servers would walk up to them, examine them, then leave them and just walk...around.  Back and forth.  It was absurd.  Even if there was a good reason for their behaviour, at least be aware that to hungry patrons waiting a long long time for food, it just looks like you don't know what you're doing.  Pitiful.

The upside is the food was good (though a tad lukewarm, what with waiting on the kitchen counter).  My wife had a poached egg with salmon while I had the afforementioned Caesar salad with maple bacon.  The price was reasonable too.  The portions were a bit skimpy but I would have gladly ordered more, if only I wasn't worried about getting the food next week.

Until this place gets its act together, avoid it and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place gets such poor reviews. I popped in today to grab and go and although there should have been at least one more person working,  the service was good and not too slow. The woman behind the counter was attentive, polite and friendly.  I ordered a hot chocolate which was very reasonably priced for the quality.  It was all milk, not too sweet,    and very good. I also got a croissant which was flaky and crispy on the outside but soft, buttery, and chewy on the inside. The only thing is that it was a bit greasy. I'll go back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food was ok the service was horrible.  The waitress took our drink orders and never returned with them until we went to look for her.  She said she thought the food runner was bringing them and said sorry it was because there was a large private party however she was not serving the private party but talking to her boyfriend and various friends who came to visit her.  This is really unfortunate the food was ok and it's the only place to eat in this area.  Whoever owns it should smarten up and focus on service. A place like this will not last with horrible service like that.  I'd rather walk 10 blocks than eat here again."}
{"text":"We live in the Paintbox Condo above the restaurant and when we first moved in came a few times and found the service ok but really slow and the limited menu was over priced so we stopped going.
I decided to drop by for lunch today. There were 3 groups of people at tables eating and 2 servers ... When I walked in no one acknowledged me.. One of the servers got more water for one table .. Then the other server cleared some plates and they still didn't acknowledge me.. The servers went behind the counter and chatted with each other while I stood there.. I grabbed menu and sat down.  Still nothing. The servers brought a coffee to one table and the bill to another then went back to chatting with each other...I walked in at 12:05 and at 12:18 I walked out and went around the corner to Suko Thai were I was served immediately"}
{"text":"I went here this past Saturday for brunch, we were immediately seated and the wait staff was polite, both my guest and myself ordered the omelette of the day which was a very basic omelette with a sliver of brie cheese and a few pieces of red and green peppers, the side dishes were a very basic salad with a drizzle of vinaigrette dressing and literally half of a pan fried potato. Overall every single dish was very bland - I had asked the wait staff for additional salad dressing but they forgot to bring it, I had also asked for a side of ketchup and it literally took 15 minutes to get this, by the time I received it my dish was luke warm at best. Lastly all of this was served on a cutting board for the plate...ok I get they are trying a chic model look but a cutting board is just not functional eat off, the melted brie cheese spilled out of the omelette and on to the table, and all this for $13.00 each - there are far superior breakfast restaurants in the area, namely Frans.

Needless to say I do appreciate what the owner is trying to do and I will go back at least once more for dinner as I do realize some days restaurants can just be on their off days, hopefully my next experience is better as I'd hate to never want to eat here based on convenience alone (I own a unit in the PaintBox Condo's)."}
{"text":"Whoever owns or manages this operation should update their web presence - their operating hours on Yelp is drastically different from what their website says.  

Secondly, if the website is correct: what kind of restaurant/bistro would NOT SERVE DINNER?  Nor open on Sundays??  Paired with lack-lusture reviews, it's hard to venture even across the street to find out if this place is indeed open."}
{"text":"I love how close this place is to my condo as I live in one park place down the road. I've been here for about 1.5 years and really wanted to give this place a shot. I liked the kale salads and the chicken breast to go if I'm in a pinch. However I ordered a meat ball with a soup and the meat was so undercooked I felt sick when I cut it open. Instantly in the trash and goodbye paintbox. 
After a few times I will not be back, not even for a coffee. The staff are so rude... I have no idea why but every time I'm there I get horrible attitude. I am so NOT the person to say this as I love new local shops and businesses but I wish this was a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Fully back all the negative reviews found here. I came here at a friends recommendation as I was new to the area and wanted a healthier restaurant option.

I ordered the mac and cheese with crispy salad for $12. Pretty expensive as the portions were very small (smaller than Bobbie Sue's Mac and Cheese). It claimed to be 3 cheeses but I couldn't really tell - it was a mush of cheese, not very stringy like: Honestly, the salad felt like it came from those prepackaged Walmart/Costco tubs. It was \"crispy\" because it had thin slices of grated carrots among such. 

Service was meh. I asked the lady behind the counter (not a cook, just cashier) what was in the crispy salad and she had no idea. She asked the kitchen staff, and then told me, 'I don't know but its good'... clearly not. It took about 1/2 hour to get it to go which honestly is pretty disappointing - I saw other individuals who ordered me receive their order before."}
{"text":"This place has a nice laid back community vibe but is better at the cool laid back community thing than as a restaurant. 

Just one example - ask to have your sandwich cut in half and they'll tell you that nowhere in their big handsome kitchen is a knife to do the job.

They also spend a weird amount of time rearranging tables for whatever is happening next.

Five stars as a hangout spot. One star as a place to have a meal. Average 2.5 stars, rounded up to three"}
{"text":"Food is good but sometimes a little expensive for the portion. The menu changes after which is good and the atmosphere is chilled. It's also a B Crop (social enterprise) which is extra awesome"}
{"text":"Love the idea behind the Paintbox Bistro but the food and service is terrible. We ordered fish and chips and the \"chips\" came with our dessert. The website said the steak was halal but when we asked the server to confirm, they said it was in fact not halal. I really want to like this place but get disappointed every time we come."}
{"text":"I am disappointed every time I come here!

For example, I came in now to find them closed; despite the sign on their front door saying that they're open until 6pm. There have been innumerable other minor complaints. I've been trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm disappointed every time I come here!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wanted to like this place.  I really did.  Such an admirable philosophy behind the place.  And a fun decor and design.  

My partner and I were here for brunch this past weekend, and it was just a comedy of errors.  We had to wait for over five minutes at the door in a half-empty restaurant for anyone to take note of us.  And then we had to wait at the table for ten minutes for a waiter to come over.  

Although the service was polite and friendly, it was very amateurish, often disappearing for long periods of time.  Water glasses went unfilled.  The same goes for the food, which took over twenty minutes to arrive, and when it did, it arrived all at once.  Our starters were a microscopic salad and miniscule portion of soup, both of which we received literally a minute before our main course, which was a very unremarkable frittata.  No sides or anything -- not even a slice of toast or a potato to be found.  It wasn't bad, but just very bland, and skimpy.

All of this set us back almost 40 dollars (before tip), and this is without coffee or any other beverage besides water to drink.

I won't rush back."}
{"text":"Delighted to learn about this restaurant - social enterprise aspect is lovely and the restaurant stands on its merits as well.  Aptly named, \"Paintbox\",  there's creativity in their approach to original menu items, to service (dessert in mini-mason jars, teapot & cup delivered on a board, milk for coffee in mini-milk bottles, etc.) and to the decor.  We walked in late on a cold Tuesday night, no other customers in the room, they'd been about to close; instead they reopened the kitchen for us and served us graciously for about 2 hours!  Wait staff, kitchen staff - all keenly interested in ensuring our good experience.   Look forward to going back to try other dishes and enjoy the Saturday night entertainment that's happening."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended this restaurant last evening, for a dinner out with entertainment. We found the food simple and yet delicious. The kingfish served on a bed of kale was light and tasty. The cheesy macaroni, couscous and mushrooms was flavorful, although a bit heavy a choice for the evenings dining. Service was attentive and friendly.

One of the additional reasons we chose this bistro in Regent Park, was for the entertainment they have lined up for the beginning of summer. My wife and I shared a fantastic evening listening to R&B, Soul artist DRU. For the calendar for the month of June, they have many more events planned, including during the Jazz festival.

The combination of the wonderful food, along with the marvelous entertainment made the Paintbox Bistro an easy choice for a fantastic evening out for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"What this place wants to be and what it is are a long ways apart.  It is a fairly nice space.  Superb artists come here to perform, likely drawn by the \"socially responsible\" setup as a training and employment place for Regent Park locals and George Brown students.
But suffering through the dismal food, beverage, and service offerings to hear great music ruins what could be a great evening.  Reserving early and paying in advance won't even guarantee you can get a table where you can hear the music, let alone see the stage.  Ignoring customers is an often used problem-solving strategy.  I have a theory that the developer of the new Regent Park is filling a lot of the seats, because there seem to be exclusive reserved tables that are not available to the public, even when you have been told you bought the first tickets.  Those tables get preferential treatment from staff.
The kitchen puts out a limited menu of fairly ordinary food.  Nothing really wrong with the food, but if it wasn't for the music, I wouldn't go just for the food.  Not much choice in beer or wine.  And the wait staff haven't passed the spilling things, serving on the wrong side, and hanging their bums over your table while serving another one.
Look for your favorite musicians at other venues."}
{"text":"I was there for a staff function. The finger foods were; under cooked chicken wings, veggie springroll that seemed like chicken, mini pita w/ mushrooms and cheese and crab cakes that were a tad spicy but you couldn't get to the sauce for them because no plates or utensils were put out. 

Nice atmophere. Nice bathrooms. Nice staff. The band the agency hired were great but it was way too loud for the space. 

Dinner was spinach, roasted mini onions, chicken (that was cooked) on what I'm guessing was grits??!! but tasted like cornmeal like flour!! Dessert was two mini tarts; lemon and chocolate."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner. Food was mostly lovely.  No condiments offered with frites ... ketchup/mayo/aoili, anyone? Very clean and fresh feeling space.  I don't understand the odour of the cooking oil in the air.  Broccoli soup was somewhat flavourless. And no salt/pepper at the table to fix it. Overall, a good work in progress."}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe, cool building in a revitalized neighbourhood. So far I've had the steak wrap, a cheese croissant and a latte, which were all good. Customer Service though... It must be some kind of performance art. Read the reviews below and be prepared. (I'm giving the 3 stars for food only)"}
{"text":"So I hate to give a place such a terrible rating, coming from an industry background myself. But seriously, I was appalled. So i arrive here with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours, really excited to try this place having heard great things. Upon arrival, it took probably 2-4 minutes before we were sat. I dint have a problem waiting for service when a place is clearly busy and you have to wait your turn. This was not the case. The place wasn't even half full.  Servers kept looking at us and not doing anything. Finally we were sat. After another 3-5 minute wait our drink order was taken. Their beer list has something that really made me double take. They serve laker lager. Yes that's right. Buck a Beer, high school park party laker. I mean i know its old regent park but still. I hope they were being ironic. The ambiance of this place is fine. It doesn't look a little ikea catalogue for me, but I don't think that is overall the worst look a place can have. Our drinks come. We wait somewhere between 5-10 minutes for someone to come and take our order. This was something that really bothered me. Everywhere you looked, staff was standing around chatting. It got to the point where i said if they don't come in 4 more minutes we are paying for our drinks and leaving. Luckily our server caught it at the last second, and we stayed. The food was fine, The portions were a tad small, but pretty much everything was tasty. Except for the soup i ordered. Usually in my experience leek soup is creamy hardy and delicious. What they serve here is more like warmed up wheat grass juice. The soup tasted like someones front lawn. Not into it. So in summation, the food was fine, but not extraordinary, but my over all experience was very poor. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was okay, had a mix up with our salad and the server was fairly aggressive in terms of telling us what we had asked for.  Not sure what happened to the customer is always right, but a couple at the adjacent table mentioed when she moved away, they heard us order because they thought, Oh, they are having the same salad as us.  Other than that misunderstanding, it was good.  Would have given them a four star if this hadn't happened."}
{"text":"The paintbox bistro has some REALLY cool things. Oolong teas, kombucha, every kind of relish I could think of, Mac and cheese, turkey dinners, soup in Mason jars, dried kale, coffee, lattes, espresso, chicken, root veggies, Jamaican patties... I don't know why I never went in here before.
There's a nice atmosphere, water with lemon, the staff are friendly.
Some things are over priced but many are completely reasonable.
I like this place!"}
{"text":"This is an attractive place with a social purpose and the worst service I have ever seen--disinterested, sometimes surly. Place was almost empty too. Salad was good, however. I will not return."}
{"text":"As a first-timer to Paintbox Bistro to see a jazz band on a Friday night I must say that this place is an good venue to spend an evening while watching a show / comedy / concert that they so often host. Mind you, there is a nominal charge if you wish to sit in the lounge (free to mostly $10).

The place is well maintained and clean with smart decor. Anyhow - the service was stellar with our server being extremely attentive and helpful throughout the night. I practically lost count on how many times our server asked us how we're doing. On ambiance, I'll provide it a 7/10 while service 9/10. 

In terms of food - with price ranging $15-$20/plate on the main course I would say that this establishment deliver on that value. We ordered the steak and it was cooked correctly to our liking and seasoning was good. The frites that comes with the steak is also cooked crisp and has good amount of seasoning. Although my only complain was that we had only been given 5-6 slices of meat - wish that they would consider the portion size. 

Overall - service was superb but food is just OK. I would go back to Paintbox Bistro for an event / concert that they may have in the future but can't see myself going back just for dinner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but like many of the other reviews I also agree that the execution was not nearly as good as I had hoped it would be. 

I came to the Paintbox for an event so I never had a plated meal just drinks and small snacks. 

They seemed to have a good selection of craft beer. I had Beaus. It was ridiculously pricy but I'm not sure if that's because of the Paintbox or just because Beau's is always a bit pricy. 

The staff were very friendly and were helpful but the food definitely left something to be desire. They seemed to try and execute some pretty extravagant type of snacks, pork belly, some other pork dish and nachos with some sort of vegetarian salsa. They lacked flavour and weren't my thing. 

I really like the concept of the Paintbox and I am interested in trying it again sometime because it's a pretty neat location and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is kind of cool. I'm a bit weary of the food though but maybe that's just because we had a large group."}
{"text":"Message to the owners: I want you to succeed, and currently I don't think you're on the right path. 

I think the location and philosophy of your restaurant is great, and it's commendable that you took a chance in this up and coming neighbourhood.  However the food experience needs to move up to meet the standards of the rest of the place. 

I ordered the fish curry, cashier had no idea what's in it, which is a red flag. Ordered anyway and was very disappointed.  The saffron rice had some roasted black rice on it, very hard to chew and not pleasant or palatable. The curry was passable but I finished it in 2 minutes and didn't have any chick peas as the cashier guessed it would. There is no love in the sauce, very one dimensional and I'll guess it's not scratch. 

My partner ordered the burger, another sad looking dish. The meat was well well well done and topped with American \"cheese,\" which I don't know how it fits with your overall food philosophy.  The donut bun was atrocious, greasy and hard.  Kale salad was tasty but store bought croutons. 

I want you to step up the game, I'll come back in a few months and hope the food is better."}
{"text":"Good ideas.  Spotty execution.

This place has a lot of potential.  The decor and design is fun and playful without being too wacky.  The menu is full of interesting ideas and the food was fun and tasty.

Sadly, the service was inconsistent.  Attentive at first, but then if we hadn't waved our arms in the air I don't know how long it would have taken to get our bill and pay.

The food came on an odd variety of serving dishes.  Some which worked (cutting board for burger & chips) and some which didn't (same large cutting board for cup of coffee, high-sided glass casserole for salad).

The burger was delicious, but the bun was too dense so when squeezed all the juices splooged out.  The red-cabbage on the burger was also tasty and interesting, but perhaps should have been drained/squeezed first so it wasn't so drippy (see above re: splooge).  Glad I didn't wear a white shirt.  The mixed-root-veg chips that came with it were pretty great, though. :)

If I had just walked off the street into this place, I would have been disappointed.  I was told beforehand, though, that it's a bit of an experiment and a work-in-progress.  As I understand it, they hire local folks from the neighbourhood and recent grads from the culinary school at George Brown and help them hone their skills.

I look forward to returning and hope to see some of the kinks worked out! :)"}
{"text":"Paintbox Bistro is located underneath one of the new condos that just finish building in the Regent Park area and has been opened since September 2012.  The little cute bistro has a paintbox theme and has a nice table setup with colourful daisies and paintbrushes in little jars as part of the centre piece.  There was also a small stage for live music.  I've been here once for a small catered event and another time for a sit-down dinner.  Both times I was thoroughly impressed with the type of food that they served.  I admit that the name \"bistro\" conjures images of random sandwiches, soups and pastas, but Paintbox bistro does not have a run-of-the-mill menu at all.  

Their catered event used cute little mason jars to serve cous cous with a mushroom blend, and also used the jars to serve chilled desserts in small individual portions.  The dine-in experience, I saw the mason jars holding the mushroom medley beside my creamy potato risotto served atop a wooden cutting board.  My friend Ashley had the tomato smoked pork soup and it was also tasty.  Just a note that the primers (cute way of referring to starters) is very large.  Overall, their food was really good although I wasn't very impressed with some of the side vegetable dishes including the beets and cauliflower sides that came with my short ribs and the assortment of bread that was served as the starter.

Just a note that they have very specific hours for serving their meals, but they did let us sit and drink wine while we waited for dinner to start.  I am impressed with the wine selection, and they also allow bringing your own wine with a corkage fee of $20.

{"text":"First time trying this place and will NOT be going back. Got the Jamaican patties they were dry and lacked flavour. Customer service wasn't good no one came to help us.... until they noticed I had my dog. I had intended to order more but was told to leave because of my dog which brings me to my second issue. Least dog friendly bistro in Toronto. Couldn't keep my well trained dog tied outside for a few minutes while getting takeout as there are signs all over saying no dogs on the grass which was the only area available to tie a dog. 

In conclusion wouldn't recommend and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Paintbox for the first time and will definitely be back!  The chicken sandwich was like homemade southern fried chicken. Yummy!! Nice vibe in the space, fabulous and friendly service, and the food presentation was really nice. A casual and comfortable spot."}
{"text":"My daughter & I were next door attending Unplugged Expo 2 convention in Oct. 2013 & con organizers had thoughtfully CLOSED any on site food facilities all weekend. Starving by lunchtime, we had no choice but to dash in the miserable rain to the pretentiously named \"Paint Box\" \"Bistro.\" 

We were somewhat underwhelmed by its poor selection deli menu with a display of tiny packaged unappetizing \"healthy\" snacks and little bottles of obscure juices and waters. A sign announced a \"Special Menu\" for the con, which turned out to mean a LIMITED menu of just 2 choices. You should be honoured they bothered to serve con goers even that much, was the implication. Trapped and hungry, we chose the overpriced, bland and skimpy sandwiches, which fell apart all over the plate, and which included bitter unseasoned veggie sides. It was all about stylized cutesy presentation but nothing about making sure the food was actually flavourful; it was just barely mediocre.

Social experiment, my ass. This pathetic hipster cafe, fraudulently calling itself a \"bistro\" would have never made it as a business past 6 months, except for 2 facts: 

1. It is the only eating facility near the Daniels Spectrum/Artscape events facility building. 
2. It is being used as a training facility for Regent Park locals & George Brown College culinary school grads. And guess what? You are the guinea pigs!

AVOID. AVOID. AVOID."}
{"text":"They need to update their menu and come up with new dishes for this place to be deserving of 4 or 5 stars. The way the menu is setup right now, it's not very inspiring or worthy of a trip to this part of town, I'll be honest. Their shrimp tacos, for instance, were ok, but no where near the level of Barrio Coreano or Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos. So, I don't see any reason why I would be compelled to come back here, when there are so many other better options in the vicinity of 1-3KM. Sorry, Paintbox Bistro, but you did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"I am a student and do my coop in the same building as this place. I come here on average once a week, and sometimes I just buy a cookie or something. I've liked  the taste of the food and the design of the place, but the service is always weird. This place makes the whole comunity look way better but the staff seem sassy and hate their job. Today I got the curry wrap to go and after I ate it I saw my boss heading to throw away some grilled veggies I was going to get from the restaurant. She said it tasted funny and the food doesn't look and smell right. Then she brought up how she had the breakfast sandwhich and it looked terible inside it, the eggs wen't cooked properly and the bacon was half cooked. Another co worker then said that she had the steak wrap the other day and it didn't agree with her at all. I thought to myself, \"always eat here and I dought I will have the same problem\". I got home... And had a date with my toilet. Never coming here agian!
Edit: Also this place is way pricy compared to the comunity it is in."}
{"text":"I love that Paintbox has struck out in Regent Park, engages locals trained at George Brown and takes its inspiration from the community around it.  My problem is that I liked the idea of Paintbox more than the reality of it.  

I really enjoyed the Moroccan-spiced Cornish Hen with  quinoa salad which was flavourful and well constructed but the crisp-skinned Organic Salmon with fennel & tomato braised white beans was rather uninspired.  Overall, the total experience (from food, to decor to service) didn't feel developed.  Like an experiment that hasn't quite found its legs yet.  It feels earnest and I am routing for it but it isn't there yet - particularly at the prices currently set.  

Lastly, I felt confused by what Paintbox is trying to be.  On the one hand the menu is ambitious with complex dishes they aren't quite executed and  are pricey and on the other is a cafeteria style, casual atmosphere that is informal and colorful.  They aren't in accord for me.  The informal setting doesn't work with a menu that aspires to be delivering a higher end culinary experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to an NXNE comedy show at this \"bistro\". Despite the establishment's effort to be a yuppie and hip east end hot spot, it misses its mark completely. 

Pitfalls
- No proper drink menu
- No draft beers
- Serves only overpriced bottled beers

That's just to name a few...

I ended up only ordering a $5 can of PBR and the boyfriend ordered a bottle of Guinness and the daily soup. Everything here is mediocre from the menu and lack of offerings to the lacklustre atmosphere and total disorganization amongst the staff. 

What a train wreck of a place."}
