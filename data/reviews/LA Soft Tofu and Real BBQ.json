{"text":"I've had far better beef ribs at Korean BBQ locations in Richmond Hill, and have yet to find a good BBQ in the Christie area.  We ordered the AYCE meats, and the first was a big slab of beef that the staff insisted on turning over for us - same with the pork and the chicken.  The staff came over, and worked our BBQ for us.  Isn't that the point of Korean BBQ?    Anyhow, the pork was flavourful, but most small free dishes (besides the Kimchi) was far too salty.  The hot soup was as well, and tasted like miso soup with a little hot sauce and onions added.  Will not return."}
{"text":"- i am currently in a meat coma. and my clothes smell like heaven. if heaven was made of beef and pork belly. - just came back from an AYCE 18.99 experience while randomly walking by with a buddy looking for kbbq - i have been looking for a downtown spot that does kbbq (other than the no frills, low quality of korean grill). and i think this is it. - the staff was not so fast, but they were really helpful in turning and cutting the meat for us. - even came with lettuce, garlic, and the sesame oil/salt dip which felt pretty authentic. - will definately be back.... only got through 4 rounds of meat.... - also note, that it's a CASH ONLY joint..."}
{"text":"A terrible restaurant.  For one, the food is just terrible. There were 8 of us, ordering different food, and none of it was very good. I had the pork bone soup, which was watery and very skimpy on the meat. Also, there was no potato and no rice.  I was told that the Korean BBQ (full serve) was also very disappointing. My friend had a bowl of seafood noodles and found \"3 pieces of seafood larger than a dime\".  The service was slow and seemed to be exasperated by all our orders.  A terrible experience all around. No wonder no one else reviewed this place."}
