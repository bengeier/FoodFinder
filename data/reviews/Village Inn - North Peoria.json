{"text":"This restaurant location is brand new but there are numerous other restaurant locations. My wife had the Garden fresh Skillet and I had a VIP build your own breakfast which consisted of two eggs scrambled, two sasuage links, a bagel with cream cheese, and two pancakes. My meal's flavor was nothing to write home about and the quantity lacking, mainly do to the size of the pancakes. My pancakes had a funny taste and were tiny, about the size of the old silver dollar pancakes. The bagel was small-to-medium in size and a cheap water bagel. It was toasted correctly, and came with a single prepackaged cream cheese. The eggs were of decent quantity and OK flavor. The sasuage links were of average size and flavor. We had asked for real butter instead of margarine, and got the little prepackaged pads. Regarding my wife meal, it initially looked good but was cold so we asked for it to be remade, which they gladly did. The second skillet did not look as good and according to my wife the eggs tasted funny. I tried them and found them acceptable so I finished her meal I was still hungry.
My wife liked the flavor of her three tiny pancakes. The manager was walking around asking everyone how they liked their meals. My wife commented on the flavor of the eggs, he said the cooking staff sometimes uses too much cooking oil and he will talk to them. That was all he said and went to the next table. The staff at the restaurant were great. They were friendly and eager to please. The rest rooms were of course new and very clean. In summary, you go to the restaurant for the food, not the staff or rest rooms. There many other similar style restaurants out there for the same price you can get better tasting food and larger quantities. Of course we only had their breakfast and their other meals may be better. We did not have any of their pies. It has been my experience however, that your meal is a good representation of the other meals. So we do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Village Inn is village \"out\"...at least this location. It's a shame because it's close. However hit this place with the lady last Friday night. Once our butts hit the seats, the service was bad and didn't get better. I'd like to say the cold sausage links and undercooked veggie skillet made up for it, but yeah, it didn't. Seems apparent to me after two visits, this place has an identity crisis. Hope they turn it around, but unless or until they do, I'd rather eat at Los Pollo's Hermanos (aka El Pollo Asado) across the street."}
{"text":"The coffee here looks like tea and tastes like hot water that sat next to some coffee grounds for a minute. Super weak. Service gets the stars -friendly and prompt. The omelettes are dry with the cheese (very minimal cheese) on top instead of in the middle. Very mediocre. Bacon was crispy, but sausage had a bland, yet funky taste. Not worth a return trip for an egg breakfast. Pancakes, waffles, or crepes might be better. Pies looked like they are mass produced. There have to be better places to eat nearby. Skip it (the prices aren't worth the quality of the food)."}
{"text":"By far the worst place for breakfast on this side of town! It took them an hour to get our food out... Our food was cold so it had to be sent back and remade that took another 25 minutes!! I'm pretty sure the manager there was high on something because when she came to apologize for the bad service she could barely hold still..We've gone there twice and this is our last! I do not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Server was unfortunately mentally challenged, and didn't know what he was doing, but I'll let that slide since it just opened. The food was very good, however the portions need to be much bigger."}
{"text":"THERE WAS A STICKER IN MY FOOD. Restaurant was busy, had a long wait even though there were several empty tables. 
Waitress was friendly, but very very busy. Orders were taken fairly quickly, but it took 15-20 minutes to get our drinks and food didn't come out for another 40-45 minutes. No drink refills were given in this time either. When food came, my omlette had half a ham steak in it that was more bone than ham and had a date sticker stuck to it! In my omlette! At this point, I didn't want to wait another hour for something else to be made, so just decided to end my visit. Will likely not be back."}
{"text":"Looked forward to visiting this new restaurant.   The food was horrible.  Hash browns were uncooked, white mess. My crepe was so hard I couldn't eat it.   Told our waitress and she was nice, but the Meal should have been redone or for free.  Not the way to open a new place."}
{"text":"We visit usually once a week. The food is always good and comes out pretty quickly! Hands down Melissa H. Is the best server, she is very sweet, attentive, and makes sure you always have what you need. I'll always wait just to sit in her section and get the best service!!"}
{"text":"We decided to grab a late lunch in order to miss the noon rush restaurants typically get. We arrived and were seated right away. It was not busy at all, so we figured we'd be in and out pretty quick. Wrong! After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes for it to arrive - absolutely no reason it should have taken this long when your entrees are a grilled cheese and eggs.

What made us give a 1-star review though was the fact the server and assistant manager couldn't quit apologizing to the people behind us for their wait, comping parts of their order and offering free pie. Now, we arrived and ordered BEFORE the folks behind us and yet our food arrived within minutes of each other. We were the ones who had a longer wait, but not even a simple \"I'm sorry\" was muttered to us. 

Also, the entire time we were there dirty dishes sat on a table directly in sight line. Not the most appetizing thing you look at when eating. 
 
The food in general is hit or miss. The last time I was here I ordered hash browns but they were so hard I couldn't even cut them. It was like they got overcooked or were left out too long. The fries today were limp and soggy. 

Overall, okay food but a horrible customer service experience. Stay far away. If you're looking for a good breakfast spot, check out The Haymaker across the street."}
{"text":"There is nothing more aggravating than to buy food from a restaurant that claims to be great! For starters this place is going downhill quickly, it's already dirty and looking shabby, this is my 3rd time coming in, to buy pies, never slices only whole pies. Was there for breakfast once before, not crazy about their food, specially when things are heated in microwave. To be specific about these slice are TEENY-WEENIE slices and all messed up looking like the cutter ran them over them instead of cutting them. Specially the coconut & silk pies If your pictures show a fairly decent size, I suggest you trained your staff better, it shouldn't be that hard to cut a nice slice of \"PIE\" I expect to get what I paid for. I should have checked before leaving restaurant but I trusted that I would not have an issue wit a slice of \"PIE\"
At least the young girl waiting on me was very nice."}
{"text":"Good food.  Served pretty quick.  The food was served hot.  Josie did a good job.  Very attentive to senior citizens."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for the pies...you can buy them by the slice or entire pies.

I had breakfast and there are tons of options on the menu...almost anything you would want.  I especially enjoyed the numerous egg white options.  Its not ultra fancy...standard American breakfast. 

Server was friendly and manager stopped by the table to make sure all was great."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Save your money and go to IHOP or someplace else.  It took forever to get seated and there were plenty of empty seats in the restaurant. That should have been the first clue. Then I got orange juice that was watered down. Two sets of silverware that had dried up stuck on food. A coffee pot that looks like it's been used over and over again did not clean. And subpar food at best. Oh and I forgot the best part when we ask for sugar we were brought a handful of Sweet and Low and Splenda with only three sugars and it was handed to me in a bundle. This place is poorly run and the service is horrible choose someplace different. This was my second chance for this location and it failed again."}
{"text":"20 minutes to get our food, gravy on the biscuits and gravy was cold, not even room temp!"}
{"text":"So I came into the location late night and was very hesitant based on the reviews. The place was pretty slow which is what I expected to see. Being the sarcastic person I am, I was making jokes about how busy the place was and the staff took it well. The server Sarah had a great sense of humor and did a great job. Overall the staff was very friendly and attentive. 

The food was on point. I order a burger and customized it which came out exactly how I asked. My friend ordered an omelette and that also came out well done. Oh and for the PB fans out there...you have to try he Chocolate PB Cup pie 

Overall I would say the food was what I would have hoped it would be and the staff was great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Early morning breakfast. Seated quickly and courteous service. Food was great. No issues. Glad to have a village inn close by"}
{"text":"Came in today to treat my son on his Bday to a good breakfast. Having been to the the other VI in Surprise yesterday for Father's Day, I had a 20% off coupon to use on this visit. 

Today is Monday, arrived around 10:30, place was not crazy busy as I suspected and was sat right away. 

The host/cashier was very friendly upon walking in. His name was Zachary. He asked me booth or table, which I appreciate, as I prefer a booth. 

Our server came over within 10 mins of being seated, ordered our drinks. She came back within a timely manner, and then we placed our order. I had the VIB breakfast: 2 eggs over easy, hash browns, 2 turkey sausages, and French toast. Son had the double cheese bacon burger/ fries. 

As we were waiting for our food, I was looking around since this being my 1st time at this location and glad I did.   Right across from us leaned up against a chair was a broom/pan. Like someone was attempting to sweep up, then just left. The floor by the broom was visibly dirty. So I looked under my booth and sure enough it was a frickin mess. ** I posted 2 pics ** Like some family with little ones were just there. My table top and seats were clean, but the surrounding areas were a fail. Not very attractive especially when this is a place to eat. 

Food came out in a decent time frame, it was what we ordered. Mine was delicious and cooked perfect, unlike the one in Surprise where it came out dry as this AZ heat. Son couldn't even finish his burger ( this says a lot for a 17 year old). He did say the fries were great. Our server came back a few times to check on us as well as refill drinks. I didn't get her name, but her customer service was on par. 

Overall, the food was good, the customer service was good, our area was dirty. I'm sure it was just overlooked. So yeah, I'd give it another chance."}
{"text":"Best Family Meal! My family and I had really good food, a wide variety to choose from and AMAZING SERVICE from MELISSA and KORY! Melissa and Kory made us feel valued and treated us like we were family! Melissa was attentive and very efficient. We never had to ask for anything. If you want FANTASTIC SERVICE ask for MELISSA'S section. Mainly works evening's and Monday mornings. Don't go in on Tuesdays or Thursdays, that's her days off! Wait for her, you will be glad you did! Be sure to look for Kory, he's very engaging and has a million dollar smile!!! Great experience because of these two. Thanks for a wonderful evening out! We WILL be back soon!"}
{"text":"First visit
Dining area clean
The male manager has no customer service skills. 
The female manager was very polite and apologetic when her manage failed to perform his duties
The server was nice"}
{"text":"The people were super nice, but they ran out of chicken, chicken fingers, chicken breast, all of the above. How can you run out of chicken!"}
{"text":"I got here quite often it's a good place the just added a crepe burrito ..!! Omg it's to die for so delicious n there have a fast service bringing food out so far every thing is great"}
{"text":"Terrible.... service was lack luster... order was wrong... glasses and silverware were dirty... stay away"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying - I love Village Inn... or shall I say loved. My daughter and I go and get almost the same thing each time. We get the VIB breakfast where you select four items. Hers usually changes - mine is the same. This location and the one at 3rd Street and Bell Road I will never go to again!!! If I could get zero stars I would!!!

The waitress was VERY slow!!! We could have driven home and cooked everything our selves in the time it took to get drinks. It took at least 15 minutes for the waitress to come over at which time we were ready and placed the order at the same time as our drinks. It took at least another 10 minutes to bring out an ice tea and lemonade, but no straws. She said she would return...took her MUCH more time. During this time, I noticed there was something on the glass of lemonade my daughter was given. She does not like to complain and said it was on the outside - It will be OK.

This time she ordered scrambled eggs, chicken tenders with gravy (from premium list), yogurt, and 1/2 waffle. Her waffle was cold?! (OK it had been sitting there) The scrambled eggs were also cold but crunchy?? How are scrambled eggs crunchy?? The chicken tenders were a total joke!! They were about the size of a medium-sized shrimp with about a teaspoon of gravy total. The only thing that seemed OK was the yogurt as we watched someone spoon it out of the container and it was still cold.

On to my order - I always get poached eggs, the hamburger patty with a slice of cheese, oatmeal with the fixings, and strawberry crepes (usually some of the BEST food) - NOT this time. The waitress spilled the milk all over the plate and I had to mop it up with my napkin. OK - accidents happen. As I started to put the brown sugar into the oatmeal - the oatmeal was cold and gelatinous. To top that off - the serving dish of brown sugar had something crispy and yellow on the side of the container??? OK - no oatmeal. Decide to move onto the poached eggs which were cold. Figured - OK I will cut them up and just enjoy them as best as I could. As I was cutting there was something flaky and brown on the bottom - I almost puked!!! Pushed that aside to at least enjoy the hamburger patty.... they left the paper from the cheese on the cheese!!! WTH!!! The paper was between the melted cheese and the patty. By this time I am discussed and about the puke!! I looked at the crepe - which was also cold, but the strawberries had been sitting under a heat lamp as they were dried up. 

I told my daughter were leaving - I FINALLY got the attention of our waitress and showed her. She said she would be right back with the manager BUT THEN WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE AND TOOK THEIR ORDER?!?! The manager never came out but the waitress said there would be no charge - DUH!!!! She asked if I wanted pie on the house - to which I explained I would be VERY afraid of what I would get.

I explained I usually go to another Village Inn and saw this one, so figured I would give it a try. This was the first - AND THE LAST time I will ever be eating there!!!!"}
{"text":"Have only done takeout a couple of times, for some reason the food was better the 1st time and since it was the same item, let's at least try for consistency in the food size."}
{"text":"Food was Great! Service is great. It's very clean and I noticed management was on top of thier game!.. I've been to other village inns and I think I found my new location! Eggs tasted Great! Prices are good.. can't ask for more. Great job village inn you have earned a new former IHOP customer. Our server Amanda was Great! Ask for her if you want great service!"}
{"text":"Okay, I get it. You're new. You're busy. What the staff lacks is teamwork.  Our waitress was slammed, but no one stepped up to help her. Waited 10 minutes to place a drink order. Another 10 minutes to place my food order. Drink was never refilled. Other wait staff standing around  literally making eye contact with me, but not looking at the table to see how they can help. Manager walking around, stops by to talk to angry customers to the right and left of me. Does he look at our empty drinks. No.  Now he's having a conversation with the angry customer to my left, just shooting bull. Wake up!  Your restaurant is slammed. Get in the weeds with them! I'll come back, but it will be months."}
{"text":"So far we've waited for a longer than average time by far. Like 25 min sitting until someone realized we hadn't even gotten our drink order. So we ordered everything then and then it took a long time more to get food. After that the orders are wrong on the meals....we've been here before and this was the worst experience so far."}
{"text":"Alright so, my grandfather and I have our favorite place for brunch. After years of going there He mentioned one day we should go somewhere new and mix it up. I was shocked! He's 83 and doesn't ever try new things! Anyway, he wanted somewhere normal where he figured he could depend they'd have good normal breakfast food so VillageInn it was. There was a wait to be sat-truly no problem how is that any fault of the staff? The service was slowish, but it was busy so we really didn't mind. What really give this place such a low rating was the food. Really wow...so bland and pieced together unwell. Truly flavorless food. I don't think it was the cooks. I think the owners of company or franchise whatever it is, just orders the cheapest & lowest quality food they can find.  
3 stars for the service and friendly staff 
1 star for the food"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and provided great customer service, but the pies were not too impressive. The pictures made the product look better than it tasted."}
{"text":"I used to go to Village Inn for the French Silk pies with my mom when I was younger. It was always a hit when we brought it to parties and get togethers. Outside of that, I seldom went to Village Inn much but now there is one near my house, so my hubby and I decided to finally try it since it opened recently.

Our waiter, Steve, from Cali was very friendly and nice! He was quick to get our order and always checking in to see if things were okay. My hubby had the chicken fried steak and I ordered a newer menu item unexpected at Village Inn, Tres Huevos Rancheros. My entreé came with a choice of 3 meats. I think it was either grilled chicken, chorizo, or carñitas. Steve was embarrassed because he forgot to ask how the eggs should be prepared. Then, he also forgot to ask which meat I wanted with the meal. Of course, I went with the carñitas and I also asked for avocado with it! 

He brought our check out when the food was set on the table in case we were in a hurry. In spite of this, I was still craving some pie, so I ordered a slice of the French Silk pie. The manager stopped by to check if things were okay and commented how great my breakfast of pie and coffee was. Little did he know that I also ate that huge platter of Tres Huevos Rancheros! The tortillas were deep fried and lightly seasoned. They were excellent. I like how the tortillas were slightly off to the side of the plate so they didn't get soggy with the cheesy ranchero sauce. There was a slight spice to it but I added more Tabasco sauce anyway because I like food spicy! 

Comfort food quick. Extremely friendly and aiming to please staff. I really couldn't ask for more! Well maybe free pie slices other than Wednesdays..."}
{"text":"Our family was looking forward to something opening near our house. We decided to give village inn a try and were very disappointed. The service was very slow and the food was under average at best. Save your money and don't go"}
{"text":"Make that minus one star. Even worse than the food is the lame manager. Whoever owns this particular Village Inn,or if it's company owned,needs to get their butts in there and make some drastic changes. Hopefully this will be called to their attention,sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"We stopped by to check out the new location and grab a quick bite. Upon entrance, the manager and a host were at the seating stand. They made eye contact, but no statement. No question of How are you? Or How many today? I got the conversation going by letting them know that we were looking for a table for two. The manager looked at me and just walked away from the stand. I can appreciate that sometimes they just want to let the host do their job, but at least a notion like \"Enjoy your meal\" would be nice, especially since he already stood there for a while. Next to host began to look over the seating chart, but made little to no eye contact from start, all the way to the table. The whole exchange just felt very cold and uninviting. She did let us know who our server would be. Being that there was only one male server in the whole place, it wasn't hard to figure out who we would expected to come over and say hello. Well the server walked past us, looking at our table 4 times with no introductions or getting drinks started. You could tell he was waiting to see if we were ready to order. We weren't ready to order because we were waiting for him to come over as we had questions on the menu. After sitting for roughly 8 to 10 minutes without any contact with our server, we decided to leave and go across the parking lot to Char. In a restaurant you expect to have a certain level of service. Not high expectations but at least some service. You know, like eye contact and people talking to you."}
{"text":"To give you a reference, I came into VI around 15 to 3. The restaurant was pretty slow and only had a couple of tables to wait on. My waiter was very nice and was quick to bring out what i ordered.  Pot roast with a side Salad. Side salad was small and i asked for another one. Th waiter said ok and went a got me a second salad. 

My server James was great! He checked on my drink, how the food taste's, he also asked if i need anything else. 
Not only was he the server but also the host as well

All and all I would return for a dinner experience again. 
I would be inclined to"}
{"text":"Food was good and brought out in a timely manner. Our server Matthew got triple sat but was still great! I advised jay the manager who came to our table to check on us. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Back again. Another awesome breakfast and the service was great. This place was very busy and there were 9 of us - there were no issues with service or food. They've got it figured out if you ask me - good work! Pancakes still by far better than IHOP."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Read some yelp reviews prior to coming here. For starters don't believe the negative reviews this place is amazing. James was our  waiter I asked him for ab recommendation on what to get and he recommended the cheeseburger . I went with the double cheeseburger and a coke. Our food arrived at our table in no time. The burger wasn't frozen it was juicy and full of flavor. After our dinner was done we wanted to order a pie to go we went with the French silk pie.  James  said this was his second favorite pie there after the Lemon Supreme. So before we left we tried a slice of lemon Supreme. This pie was so good we wish we ordered a whole one of these instead of the French silk. We will be back for dinner and the lemon supreme pie. James went above and beyond for us. We will recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I really hate to slam a place but wow!!!   I was excited when they opened this VI close to me house.  Usually my experience with them is a positive one but not this time.  Got up early on Memorial Day to take the family to breakfast.  We got there around 9 or so and people where waiting outside and the waiting area inside was full.  Now I am used to that and thought nothing of it until I looked around and noticed 8 table empty.  There was a whole section of the restaurant completely empty.  Now I understand that it could have been a situation of being low staffed but on Memorial Day?!?!?   After about a 30 min wait we were seated and remained there for another 15 min before a waitress came to our table.  Food finally came out and my order was wrong not once but twice.  Just not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"Service was good. Everyone is really friends but the food is not good. It tastes like generic from a box mix. Nothing was flavored or made me go mmm. Tried breakfast twice and will not be back. Unhappy that we have so few restaurants and we're stuck with this!"}
{"text":"The place is brand new and has an updated concept, really nice.
Sabrina our server is very pleasant and helpful. So sincere.
The food and service was so good we came back two days later and James waited on us and like Sabrina very accommodating and cordial.
This is my new breakfast place, as long as Sabrina and James are working."}
{"text":"This black started out with a bang during first few weeks of opening but is going down fast. Lazy workers, poor management and terrible food. Glad IHOP will be here soon."}
{"text":"Great breakfast today and Shaleen's service was great!  Supper friendly hostess and manager checking out too!"}
{"text":"Love the food here always get the chicken ranch and the staff is friendly they treat you like family and the wait time wasn't really that long. Always love coming to village inn."}
{"text":"Wish we would've read the yelp reviews before wasting our time and $. So sad that the quality of food is terrible! Hostess seemed perplexed rolling her eyes when we asked for the corner booth that was empty. Husband ordered turkey meal. No flavor other than the extra salt they added to make it tast \"okay\". I had 1/2 sandwich with soup. Sandwich had the end of the tomatoe stem lol with one small piece of very poor quality bacon. Took a piece of pie to go. The pie crust was stale!  Owner/Manager needs to wake up! Contact corporate and buy higher quality food! Village Inn was known for their pies but they have gone downhill. Dissapointing!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and delicious! The only thing that was not so great we were told it would be 10 to 15 mins wait which is fine and ended up waiting 30 mins to be seated and then the kitchen was backed up so it took an an hour to get our food."}
{"text":"Every time my family eats here the service is amazing and the food is always good. There are multiple breakfast restaurants closer to my home but I will drive the extra distance to eat here any time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a light supper, and ordered a chef salad and cup of soup with half sandwich.  Water was delivered to our table and our order was taken.  Twenty minutes later our food was served ....soup lukewarm and so thick you could hardly call it soup.  Sandwich was cold, cheese was not completely melted and bacon was over cooked - not a pleasant result after the lengthy waiting time.  The receipt for food was left at the table when food was delivered - unusual in itself.  No one asked if our food was satisfactory, until my meal was completed and my husband's was almost completed.  This is also unusual.  A chance to complete a survey was given to the customer with the receipt, but that is taken at the register with payment.  Many people working there, so I wish them success."}
{"text":"Always fast service and good breakfast for a diner, the only complaint here is if you order fruit you only get 2 or 3 pieces so don't bother ordering fruit and everything else is good."}
{"text":"Another breakfast option finally! We have slim pickings around here for breakfast. Great for late breakfast. I'm a huge fan of breakfast all day so it suits me. Busy in the mornings on the weekends and still adjusting to the busyness. They will get it and be great. Sometimes the food can take a while if busy but they are still learning the area and when to staff."}
{"text":"Staff from hostess to waiter to cashier were friendly and attentive. Waiter, Travis, was very nice, frequently filling water, soda, and checking on us. It took 20 minutes to get our food, which wasn't too bad. Kid liked his VIP meal which allows you to pick 4 out of 30 items and loved his apple carmel pie ala mode. He really liked his scrambled eggs and bacon was well cooked. I had the grown up grilled cheese which was good."}
{"text":"Had to wait to be seated, hostess/cashier doing both positions, waitress finally comes over to advise us she will be with us in a few minutes. Place order to find out we would be substituting items because they ran out. Items were not brought out all at once leaving part of the meal cold. We will not be returning for a meal. Haven't had a problem with picking up pies. Disappointment, I have been eating here since they opened, looks like IHOP is our new spot when it opens."}
{"text":"I would probably give it four stars but I feel bad with all the bad reviews people of been giving it so far.  I've been here three times now since they opened a month ago and the service is always been great for us. I have found that I really really really love the Tres Huevos breakfast. It is fantastic and I can't stop ordering it. Be sure to stop by and check it out during the week when it's less busy. Also, there is a free slice of pie on Wednesday between 10-10 when you order anything. Super clean, Super new location in the Lowes parking lot on NE corner of Happy Valley & Lake Pleasant."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, nice staff.  I would have given them 5 starts but they forgot the comp our 3 kids meals on kids eat free day, which was a big oversight.  The food was typical --too much to eat-- as is the case often in America.  But we enjoyed the variety of choices.  Coffee was your average diner coffee but decent.  The place was tidy, well kept, relaxing.  We would visit again when we are up this way."}
{"text":"I went to have brunch with my daughter today and I would not recommend this location. The server there was not friendly at all. She had maybe three tables to serve and when I asked for a tea bag it took her twenty minutes to get it for me. We received our ticket right after we were served as if she was shooing us away. Then didn't even ask if we were paying together or if we needed anything else. I couldn't finish my food because I needed a refill on tea and it took too long then she told me you are aware that there is a fee for tea. \"Of course I knew there was I didn't expect to receive it for free. The worst service ever."}
{"text":"When this restaurant opened up several months ago, my wife and I thought we would give it a try. Huge selection on the menu and the breakfast was great. I love the idea of a pot of coffee at the table. We have made this restaurant are place to go on the weekends for breakfast only. Service is nice and the wait time is average and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The manager J was very accommodating to correct the issues from a recent visit.  We had a great fish dinner and service was excellent.  We wish the very best for success of our new Village Inn"}
{"text":"Village Inn is one of my favorite breakfast places to eat. The facility was very clean and well maintenance. The food was good, but my order was wrong and I asked them to correct it two times and it still was wrong. The staff were very friendly, but I feel as though they would not let us eat because they kept trying to have conversations with us which is very lovely."}
{"text":"Late night dinner, the skillets were great! The waitress had a friendly personality and was very attentive.  We will return."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Got a coffee and it was dirty. Had some old lipstick on it. I uploaded a picture of it. Service was sloooow. Took an hour and a half to get in and out of this place as well. And when I told the waitress about my dirty mug she didn't apologize, just huffed and puffed and took it from me and brought me a new one. No apology nothing."}
{"text":"As a corporate chain, usually Village Inn can be counted on to be consistent.  Well not this location!  They just opened a few months ago, but need better staff. I understand you're busy, but waitstaff should help each other out. Went here for a weekend breakfast- waiter never came back to check on us until we were done eating. All of our drinks were empty and even though other staff walked by with water pitchers, they don't stop to check on other customers- only their own tables. Food was greasy and tasteless with presentation lacking. This is just a bad Village Inn. Decor is nice, but management needs to train employees!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy visiting this restaurant. It's nice to find a decent place to eat that isn't fast food late at night. Despite the fact that it's in the late evening, the food is fresh the pie is awesome. The tables and floors are clean which isn't always the case in restaurants that late at night. Wish I could remember the waitress's name she treated my wife and I wonderfully. We have never been disappointed with the skillets or other choices. We always recommend this restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. First they served my friend and I brown lettuce and avocado in a salad and the second time for eggs Benedict the eggs were hard boiled. When I complained to corporate about the brown salad she offered me a coupon. I was dumb enough to come back but after over cooked eggs for Benedict I'll never go back. I mean really how can you serve TWO hard boiled eggs on Benedict ?  What's worse is they don't fix it. Go spend your hard earned cash somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stoped by tonight for dinner and had the lemon artichoke chicken. It was a very tasty dish and the service from Tammy was great. It was also free pie Wednesday which was a nice finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Awful. Service was bad. The food was bad.
It took so long to get service. He finally came so we ordered. It took forever to get our food. And then once the server brought our food he never came back. We tried flagging other servers down but they didn't pay any attention. 
I asked for over easy eggs and got over her eggs that I couldn't even cut. Sent them back and they brought some more that were the same way. The iced coffee was like flavored milk. 
We talked to management and they didn't seem care. All we received was a cold apology. I guess I would be upset too if I was a manager bussing tables. 
Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This review is for the pie. It's pretty darn good and on Wednesdays it's free. Chocolate silk and mixed berry pie are particularly tasty, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Coffee stinks however. Service is very friendly. Nice addition to the neighborhood. I like the mid-century modern decor."}
{"text":"The worst. I got chicken fried steak skillet. Looked like dog food took like an hour to get my food. I found a blue piece of plastic in the meat at one point.

I'm not sure how to describe the taste of the pancakes. Burnt pieces, heavy batter, and had kind of a sour taste.

My wife's adult grilled cheese was good. The cheese on one side of the sandwich wasn't melted at all. It was too the point my wife and I had a hardy laugh about it.

My daughters chicken fingers were delicious. My son's cheese burger was good.

The fries were hard and not good.

I ran out of lemonade half way thru meal. Waitresses seemed more in to cleaning empty tables than refilling my drink. Didn't ever get a refilll.....

Belly ache like no other once I got home.

Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner and we all ordered different items from burgers, to breakfast and dinner plates, yet everything came out hot and delicious! Melissa was a great server, so friendly and efficient.  We will be back soon! Thank you for a great, fun meal Melissa and Cory."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last Friday with the family. The place was very clean inside and decently busy. Our server came over right away and took our drink orders. When she found out it was our first time there she gave us some great recommendations. Which we took and enjoyed. My hubby tried the Reuben Hamburger, while I opted for the traditional Reuben. Our girls had the kids macaroni and cheese with fries and the funny face pancake meal. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food. We even opted to get a slice of the cookie dough pie to go. We will definitely be back to try out some of the amazing breakfast food that was showcased in the menu. I could see this place being a rival for IHOP and Denny's. It reminds me of Bob Evans from Ohio."}
{"text":"The food is HORRIBLE! We ordered our food and in less then 5 minutes we were served. 
 Burnt pancakes, breakfast potatoes were plain and hard, sausage had a bad flavor, bacon over cooked, toast was chewy. The entire meal tasted like it was out of a frozen breakfast meal box that was heated in a microwave. Hostess and waitress were nice.
The quality and size portions are not good but I guess we got what we paid for..... Cheap crap food ."}
{"text":"I called first to find out if they have a gluten free menu, I was told yes quite extensive. Not true. For dinner 2 choices,tilipia or steak. No gluten free bread or potatoes or deserts, a little pricey busy and noisy.I ordered tilipia no seasoning and got glutened,i know they can't promise totally gluten free but ive never had a problem at outback red lobster chilies fudruckers etc. I don't think they were careful. Food was so so in taste. We had a 20 off coupon and they only gave it on one meal and a coupon for free pie that they wouldn't honor because of the 20 off coupon. Manager would not help. I would never go back there again"}
{"text":"Well...that have corn beef hash. That's about the extent of this place. If you aren't picky about your food or service, stop on in!  Gravy is HORRIBLY watery. Do yourself a favor and go to IHOP. At least you know what you're getting"}
