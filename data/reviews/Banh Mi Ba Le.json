{"text":"This is a great place for Vietnamese sandwiches. It has about 10 different sandwich varieties to choose from, all of which are freshly prepared and cost quite cheap so you'll enjoy the best Banh Mi in the area for less. For a toonie-twenty five, my favaourite is the French baguette packed with pate, pickled radish/carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, hot peppers, mayo, and  their three kind deli meats - so tasty! They also have spring rolls and other rice/noodle dishes that are stored in a refrigerator at the front. Very fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"A small shop where the owner and customers are Vietnamese unlike the other banh mi shops on Spadina. They use a long thin baguette which is very crispy, but a bit dry inside. I got the bbq pork banh mi which used thinly sliced Chinese char siu style pork without the caramelization. I'm still hunting for a place in Toronto that uses this style of bread, but offers grilled pork."}
{"text":"The one in Mississauga is not as good. I prefer the location in GTA Chinatown. I like their banh mi but it's more expensive comparing to Nguyen Huong"}
{"text":"Forget Subway's $5 footlong. The Vietnamese sandwiches here are twice as delicious and they're only $2.25. No, that's not a typo. Each banh mi costs a twoonie and a quarter. No other food offers that much deliciousness for so little coin.  I've tried the roast pork banh mi and shredded chicken banh mi. Both are good but the pork was more flavorful. The lady at the till will ask, \"You want spicy?\" The correct answer is yes.  Then let the sandwich elves behind the counter work their magic.  When you get your sub, you can park yourself on one of the five tacky chairs in the rather charmless joint. Then brace yourself for the explosion of flavors and textures you're about to encounter: crisp-airy baguette slathered with buttery mayo and filled (but never overstuffed) with savory meat, cool cukes, crunchy shreds of pickled carrots, refreshing cilantro sprigs, and a few chili slices to keep it sassy.  Oh, man. Banh mi are so good I lie in bed at night thinking about eating these sandwiches. (Er...oops, was that an overshare?)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I think I lucked out because no one was in line when I arrived but about 3 people came right after. The only lady present seemed to be busy on a big order of 10 or so banh mis so I had to wait a bit before being served. I got BBQ pork as per popular recommendation and I got it spicy. Dunno if I got a random dollop of hot sauce on one end of my sandwich, but I got one eye watering bite. The baguette size is perfect (3/4 width of a subway bread) for a less messy eating. Those subways always get me mayo on my hair (is long). Overall for $2.90 this is a steal. I can imagine it'd pair well with soup in the winter time. Just wish there was more liver spread? And that the bun be a little softer...but I'm just being picky."}
{"text":"Finally! They have released all 10 banh mis to the white man! For some reason, they used to only offer 7 of the 10 subs on the English menu. But now, the final 3 have been relinquished!   Best snack for under $4 is right here folks. My main choice is the BBQ pork, but my veggie friends enjoy the tofu sub big time.   The cilantro is just right, they don't skimp on the pickled veg, and the buns are always fresh. If you're looking for a quick snack that's great value, look no further!  The hot meals, made to order look pretty sick too."}
{"text":"I love the Banh Mi shops on Spadina itself, but when I have the hankering for a tofu sandwich, this is my shop of choice. The tofu and tomato sandwich is so soul-satisfying that I am often willing to walk the 7 or 8 blocks from my place to pick up a couple of these vegetarian delights.  Having said that, I'm not sure I would walk that far for the other sandwiches offered here. They are OK at best, but for meat sandwiches, I'll stick to the ones on Spadina.  And having said THAT, I will add one last thing, which is that Banh Mi Ba Le's baguette is the absolute best I've tasted at any of the Viet sub shops I've tried in Toronto. If the other banh mi places offered the same kind of bread, well, I guess I'd be doing way more walking to Spadina!"}
{"text":"This Banh Mi place is in the same plaza as Banh Mi Saigon, and honestly they are good but aren't as good as Banh Mi Saigon.  Banh Mi Ba Le has a better heat to meat ratio then Saigon but I feel as if the actual Banh Mi isn't as crunchy nor is the sauce comparable.  Still a good alternative, and I'd recommend it if Saigon runs out or closes early (which happens quite often)! :)"}
{"text":"Hot is freaking hot!  Be careful!  I had to open 'er up and take out the chilli peppers because my mouth was on fire.  Hubby had the same but felt hot wasn't that hot.  I'm convinced I got his peppers in my sandwich.    Cheap and tasty, made to order,  next time I'll order more so that we can eat one fresh on the spot and then more for a midnight snack later.    Definitely a gem in Chinatown."}
{"text":"For banh mi, I always prefer theirs over Nguyen Huong.  I mean Nguyen Huong is great and cheaper, but they add way too much margarine, so does Ba Le but not as much.  Have always ordered assorted, a great bite on a hot summer day.  It also reminded me there was a time when I ate over load of banh mi coz I was broke.  Ba Le's baguette is always crusty and the ingredients are well balanced.  Almost come close to banh mi in Vietnam.  They are pricier tho.  I've never tried their noodle items as I think their strength is on banh mi while there are places that specialized in pho.  Their location situated near the entrance of Kensington Market so it's ideal to grab a bite to go and browse along Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Nice little banh mi place near my office. It's kind of in a horrible location, out of the way behind a corner in a plaza without much traffic on its facing side. Came here the other day for lunch to see if it was any good compared to what I'm used to.  I can say that it was definitely good fare. Could use a tad more filling (not even the expensive stuff, but veggies even).  I had a chicken and a pork banh mi. I'll be going back to try their pork bun for sure, and maybe expand upon a couple of the options they have for the sandwiches.  Hopefully more people will try it out, because a busier place is a fresher place!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place in Toronto to get inexpensive but DELICIOUS sandwiches. When I'm in the area I buy 6 at a time (they're still just as good the next day)!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Vietnamese sandwiches in the city -take it from me, I'm Vietnamese and I loveeeee Viet subs!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall kinda place right in Chinatown. Great authentic Vietnamese food with very friendly service. The ladies remind me of the good old days in Saigon. We've been coming here for years. We have not been disappointed with any dish we tried. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I misread the sign and thought it said \"SALE\" Vietnamese subs. They are already cheap I thought, but what if they were \"on sale\"? Anyhow, the sub I got was great. I like the fact that you can sit down and eat it. In contrast to the other banh-mi places in the area which are busy and crowded."}
{"text":"I've spent loads of time in Vietnam (north and south) and this place is the place in Toronto that comes closest to the Banh Mi in Vietnam. If you like smears of pate laying it down with cilantro and pickled carrots/daikon - COME AND GET IT.   Also grab a che for dessert."}
{"text":"My review is for the Tofu Bahn Mi.  They use the right bread, toast it just right, and season the tofu perfectly. I paid $2.50. I would have paid twice that much. Some of the places in the area don't toast the bread and that drives me CRAZY! And what's nice is that they add a little bit of mayo and she asked me if I wanted it on my sandwich before she spread that shit. I'm not sure if she asked to be conscious of my veggie diet or just because mayo sounds kinda gross on a bahn mi. I don't expect this on my sandwich, but I agreed to it here. It worked well. I came back the next day and had it without the mayo and liked it just the same.  Eat a tofu bahn mi here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi you can probably get in the city.. especially if you're going to eat it right away; request to have it toasted, trust me fam...   Legit a hole in the wall, this place hasn't changed since ... ever. mainly a take-out banh mi type of set up but they do have tables for dine-in and a menu with a lot of Vietnamese delicacies.  Service is super friendly as long as you're patient if you don't speak Vietnamese might not seem like it but they're actually really nice ladies I think they also speak Cantonese.   Food is homestyle in my opinion (very refreshing when living in a city where Pho is made by Chinese people in roughly 3/5 restaurants), although I still like Bun Rieu from St Clair Banh Cuon better, their take on it isn't by any means bad. The Banh Mi is a MUST don't even wait just go and order one or five... I stick with the cold cut just because by the time I walk in my mind shuts off and only focuses on filling that void ASAP.  ps get it toasted   It's a tad more expensive than the assembly line on Spadina but the extra dollar equals out to much more joy every single bite :).  If my aunt never showed me this place years ago I would've never known about it and continue to walk by like they don't got the good good in the there."}
{"text":"This has always been my go-to location for banh mi for the past decades even when they used to be $1 each! I love how they have many various selection to choose from. I always opt for the assorted. You can add chili pepper in the sub or ask for it on the side.  My vegetarian friend thought they couldn't eat Vietnamese Banh Mi until I saw they had a vegetarian Banh Mi with tofu (Banh Mi Chay). It was pretty tasty and I couldn't tell it was vegetarian! I will be ordering this again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ba Le for years since their health code violation years ago but since I was in the area and looking for a quick snack I decided to drop in as long as they had the green pass sign on their window.  I decided to order a few cold cut banh mi sandwiches ($2.60). I always liked the fact that Ba Le used the baguette style bread which was good but the quality of meats used was not too good, even though it's only $2.60, they should be using meats that aren't so fatty and meats that haven't been defrosted which affects the flavour.  For the downtown core, my first preference for traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches would be Rose's cafe but overall Que Huong on Finch Ave West in the west end makes the best traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches in the city.  FYI: They also offer Vietnamese food other than banh mi sandwiches but the selection is limited."}
{"text":"This place makes hands down the best BBQ Pork Banh Mi I've ever had! They're simple yet so good. Mmmmm. They're cheap too!"}
{"text":"I don't care if this place has been shut down in the past for rodent violations.  Anyone who thinks any restaurant in Chinatown is cleaner than the next is really fooling themselves.  Banh mi is a very cheap and traditional Vietnamese sub that was brought to Vietnam by the French, arguably the good legacy they left in that country.  All this being said, Ba Le is a nice alternative to the other banh mi shops around the corner on Spadina.  Starting with the bread.  The bread here is more true to the baguette style -- longer and crisper than the more common shorter, stubbier, chewier versions found at most Vietnamese bread shops.  The long subs are better fresh, but don't toast as well as the others, so if you are looking at eating it later, you may want to walk around the corner.    A standard sub is $2.25, but is bigger than the ones around the corner that go for $1.75.  This gets 3.5 stars for me but I rounded down to 3 because 4 just didn't seem right.  A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: banh mi ($2.25)"}
{"text":"The banh mi here seem totally legit! They were crunchy crispy bread with wonderfully fresh pickled veggies, cilantro, and whatever filling you want in there.  I had the pork tripe and the shredded chicken sandwiches, both of which were amazing. I would strongly advise eating the sandwich in the paper bag they give you, because the crusty bread made a huge mess otherwise.  They also had a lot of other Vietnamese foods to choose from. It seems to be a very popular Vietnamese place, because in the 10 minutes I was in the restaurant, about 20 people came in, and the vast majority of them were speaking Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Delish sandwiches for cheap and they open early on Sundays.  Bread is soft and meat isn't too thinly sliced where you can't taste or see it. Just the right amount of veggies to go w/ it.   Can't customize the coffee since the machine pre-makes it. Hubs likes his coffee milkier and they said no.   Cash only."}
{"text":"I got a tafu sandwich, at first was skeptical of the place but it's tasty! The lady was very nice I paid with American dollar and she took less money because of the conversion, nice gesture."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable; assorted sandwiches are the best! We only come here for viet sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very fresh buns and steamed rice rolls w pork filling ( if you can get there early enough to get it)."}
{"text":"BEST BANH MI SHOP. Such a low price for great banh mi submarines. The shredded chicken is my favourite but I've tried the BBQ pork and it's really yummy too. This location has also started using larger buns although the price is about a dollar more, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"A BBQ pork bahn mi for $2.90 including tax. There are a few other places in Chinatown to get this trending food. Nguyen Huong Food is probably my go to place (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/nguyen-huong-food-toronto). NHF can get busy although not so many people notice the extensive seating in back.   Banh Mi Ba Le brings their Banh Mi in at a good price but their Banh Mi lacks the flavor of NHF."}
{"text":"This place is pretty sketchy but it's CHEAP! Oh yeah. $2.50 for a bahn mi sandwich, it's hard to complain. Sure, you might find a rat carcass in your sub but at that price who cares. (I'm kidding - it's not THAT sketchy, but you know what I'm saying)  The roast pork bahn mi is the only one I've tried. Ask for it spicy. Very nice, I like.  They also have tofu, meatloaf and shredded chicken. But who the hell wants a tofu sandwich (wtf?)  Nothing else noteworthy here beyond the sandwiches.  Engrish spoken."}
{"text":"As a vietnamese sub lover, I had to check this place out.   I don't think the place lives up to the hype. My tomato and tofu sandy was a little dry, but it was filling and cheap (they recently hiked the price to 2.50, still a good deal).  Overall, it was a good cheap lunch but I like my viet sub from ginger's better (even if it's an additional dollar)."}
{"text":"My favourite *cheap* banh mi place in the city thusfar.  The bread is an actual baguette (thin & long) - it's lightly toasted and it's crunchy and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.  The filling is bit less than what you'll get at Nguyen Huong, but no real complaints - I've had their cold cuts and their BBQ pork and I like them both.  The bread is much better and that clinches it for me.  In addition, there are a few seats inside and you can eat your baguette or order their noodles/soup.  That's a nice plus.  However, this place is relatively expensive.  Compared to the $2.50 'large' banh mi at Nguyen Huong, the regular-sized banh mi here is $2.75 tax included.  Yup - I'm balling out of control.  If you can afford the finer things in life and the extra quarter, I recommend Banh Mi Ba Le over Nguyen Huong.  Until next time, champagne wishes and caviar dreams."}
{"text":"Solid banh mi shop tucked in on the side of a strip mall with another banh mi shop around the corner - so you know it's going to be good.  Definitely a family operation, as it felt like I was walking into a Vietnamese family's living room with the dad watching soaps on his laptop by the counter.  Their special (assorted cold-cuts) is $3.  All the ingredients were fresh including the bun, and it was a good filling/baguette ratio.  As expected, the lady making my sandwich asked me if I watned it 'spicy' - when I got the sub home, I wasn't sure if she simply forgot to make my banh mi spicy... or her definition of spicy was to wave a jalapeno over my banh mi for 5 seconds.  Despite that, solid banh mi shop - nothing to complain to about."}
{"text":"This place is almost a rival of Nguyen Hong on Spadina. Even the person making my banh mi compares Ba Le to it. And I feel that I'm in a dilemma because the bread is clearly superior here. Long French baguette that is freshly baked daily and toasted. I tried the shredded chicken and barbeque pork. Both are great. I ask for extra pickled veggies, otherwise it can be too salty.  BUT. Know this. The banh mis are pricier here. The food also always comes with a side of attitude. The lady has no patience, and will yell at you if you are too slow when ordering. You only get pate if you ask for it. Whether you get extra veggies if you ask depends on her mood. These are not problems at Nguyen Hong."}
{"text":"In my ongoing attempts at sampling the various variations of banh mi in our fair city, I found myself standing in Banh Mi Ba Le on an exceedingly gorgeous weekday.  I quickly landed on the \"cold cut\" version of the venerable sandwich, and the little old lady behind the counter asked if I wanted it spicy. (Always a very good sign.) A few minutes and $3.75 (!) later, I walked out the door with a delicious-looking 'wich.  My first bite wasn't too promising, admittedly. The crusty bread seemed like it might be too much for the sandwich to withstand, but subsequent bites proved that this just wasn't the case. The banh mi was bursting with flavorful ingredients, from cilantro to pickled carrots to cucumber. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the meat itself, which was closer in taste and texture to pate but worked amazingly well in this context.  I appreciated, too, that it tasted a little bit different from any other banh mi I've ever sampled. The requisite flavors were there but it also contained a few little additions I really dug, including a creamy sauce that provided an undercurrent of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Authenticity at its best! Everything is just perfect! The baguette has the right crunch with a light and airy texture on the inside. They're very generous with the quality cold cuts. In addition to the pepper and soy sauce added to the banh mi; this is not something other stores would add! The pate is mixed with butter, adding moisture and more goodness to the banh mi. Lastly, the pickled carrots are cut to the right size, not the huge chunky ones you get at other places. I guess the only thing that's missing is the daikon. Nevertheless, a 5 star banh mi !"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not really decorated very well, but the food was absolutely great, very authentic taste, and great price too."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole world.  the food is so cheap and its pretty ok! the bbq pork gave me diarrhea once but lots of things give me diarrhea so dont blame the ba le. the tofu tomato sandwich is a 10/10.  get it srs. stay tooned to the end for the biggest best most fun thing btw, the most important thing for u to read is towards the end so jsut bear with me  the ladies who work there, are grouchy as hell.  there are two older chinese women i see everytime i go there and theyre never nice to me.  i love them.  i like to drop them some change into their 1foot translucent pink piggy bank.   the restaurant is like \"french\" themed so they have 3 eiffel tower things in there.  the seating is probably some of my favorite seating in any restaurant ever. its hilarious, cute.  the atmosphere is comforting.  there are mirrrors and plants that REAlly liven the place up.  they really make all the difference.   today for the first time i experienced the bathroom.  one of the best and worst experiences of my life.  the stairway was dark and narrow.  very halloweeny.  the lights were off and i had to search for them myself.  entry into the basement.  something out of a horror movie very sparse large kitchen supplies placed sporadically around the expansive basement. half of basement hidden from the human eye by sheets.  not sure whats could be aroudn there  truly scary.  walk toward the bathroom door.  its the tiniest door in the world- and enter into a paradise of luxury, paranoia, splendor, serenity.  this is my favorite place in all of the universe.  the bathroom at ba le.  it's phenominal, majestic.  as you enter you wont be able to stand up straight because the ceilings are so short.  its a very psychadelic experience inside this bathroom let me tell you.  the floor has a massive slant to it so your spacial perception is really being fricked with and it feels lik ur turnt.  all. the. way. up.  there are two red and silver stools in htere that are sooooo cool.  the toilet is like inset into the wall like half the tank is inside the wall i LOVEe it gorgeous. strips of drywall are hanging from teh ceiling.  there is a soft buzz from teh AC.  two tiny paintings of cherry blossoms.  there was a no smoking thing on the door and i really understand why bc i never want to be anyway that isnt this bathroom but i alos know if i spend more than 10 mins in here i will slip into severe paranoia and fear for the rest of all time.  i hit my head on the way out."}
{"text":"Small little shop on the corner of Dundas. They sell one of the best banh mi's (viet subs)!!   All the subs range between $3-3.5 each. I usually get the assorted sub. The baguette is always fresh and crispy. The veggies are also really fresh too. The meat is good. Their subs include all the ingredients which makes it taste really authentic.   Besides selling viet subs they also sell a variety of other Vietnamese dishes and desserts.   Moreover, they also can help you send money back home if you have family members in Vietnam."}
{"text":"Tried & LOVED the spicy assorted cold cuts banh mi last week. They don't offer a large size. The bread is baguette shaped & although it is not super stuffed with meat & veggies, it was the best I have had in Chinatown. If you are hungry you need to get 2."}
{"text":"One of the many wonderful things about Toronto compared to New York is that it's easy to find Bahn Mi.  I tried this store along with another around the corner on Spadina. Both were great but this store uses the more traditional baguette instead of more standard french-italian bread.  The cold cut variation I had was wonderful.  Toronto Bahn Mi is one of the great food delights in North America.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a bad bagette. The server was not that interested in explaining any of the good choices etc. Spicy sauce was good but the food was not as good as I was hoping. Colleagues from work recommend it and raved about how nice the server was. Didn't really live up to the hype. Still not bad for $3.50. Asked what some of the other food was. Kind of got a rolled eye answer."}
{"text":"It's a such a small place on the side of a plaza which may be hard to find.  But honestly, their subs are just amazing!   It's the best I've ever tried in Mississauga.  It's fresh as they make it right in front of you.  I've only ever tried the cold cuts, which I do recommend everyone try as it is delicious and I do believe it is the majority of what everyone orders from here.  I've also tried the  BBQ Pork which is just as great as the cold cuts.  I love the baguettes that they use, it's not soggy/stale as you would expect to get from an Asian supermarket.  The best part is the subs are super cheap!  They charge about $3.00/sub which is awesome because then I get to order 5 at a time....you know to take for lunch at work too ;)  The restaurant itself is super small, not really meant to sit and eat.  More like a takeout place.  So if you're looking for some great tasting, non soggy/stale, and fresh Banh Mi, I definitely recommend you come here and support a local business!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, inexpensive ($2.25) subs at Dundas/Spadina.  If you have a TTC pass and are by the area, worth jumping off to grab one, or if you're super hungry, two.  To second Susan's rec: try the BBQ Pork Banh Mi (get it spicy).  I'll give it four stars strictly as a sub takeout (you will not want to stick around).  ETA - ask them not to put on too much mayo if its not your thing, there was quite a bit on mine..."}
{"text":"I was around Kensington Market a couple days ago and at the end of a cafe study session, began craving something to eat that's not too pricey and wanted to keep to my personal mantra of not exceeding $10 a day -- especially in downtown where I often splurge on something yummy -- and often mantra-damaging (chit ching).   I revisited the nostalgic Banh Mi Ba Le, a modest-looking-Parisian-inspired diner on 538 Dundas St West where I was first brought here by a Vietnamese friend of mine who swears by their subs.   My few moments of brave but unauthentic demonstration of the Vietnamese language failed to register any understanding with the sweet-old lady behind the counter and I quickly retreated back to plain English to place my order for the shredded chicken sub. Good try.  My order began. It's a joy watching experienced hands manoeuvre around a freshly toasted baguette putting together a medley of fresh cilantro, cucumber and pickled julienne carrots onto a bed of lightly seasoned shredded chicken.   No one ingredient was standing out, but rather, all made up a rapport of texture, flavor and color -- very much how Toronto is, and according to the Economist, our city is the best one to live in the world.   Interestingly, it's not number 1 in all areas, but, all major areas of life are ranked favorably and this consistency contributes to the greater picture of city liveability -- or, \"flavor-bility\" in the curious case of the Banh Mi sandwiches -- where there's a nice harmony of crunch, flavour and yums all wrapped up in this delicious $3.75 treat.   I would highly recommend their subs if you're into a freshly toasted, nicely-crunched banh mi."}
{"text":"My favorite go place for banh mi.  Fresh French  rolls baked on site filled with fresh veges ,sliced ham, head cheese , chicken roll, pâté and mayo.  So bad for you yet taste so good.  I always get the double meat option for a $1 more.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We literally ate for two days and spent $20 - can't get much better than that for value for money!  We were also in and out in about 30 minutes so it's great if you're in a hurry.  The baguette on the banh mi was perfectly crusty and the filling on the BBQ pork was delicious and they didn't shy away from the spice when we asked that they make the sandwich extra spicy! The broth on the pho was flavourful and the fried spring roles were tasty too. The only major draw back is that the place had a bit of a funky smell, but it wasn't enough to deter us from the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Be sure to try the weekend special! Sandwiches also excellent, and the Viet iced coffee is top notch. Ladies working behind counter are very sweet and welcoming, must try for authentic Viet Sandwiches and Toronto Chinatown experience"}
