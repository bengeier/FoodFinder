{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food take out I've had short of going to the heart of china town or Far East to Markham. It's authentic old school Chinese cooking. I'm Asian and I'm really picky with Chinese food I didn't regret ordering from here. This is my go to Chinese food take out"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite Chinese food in the city.  Always fresh, always good, always cheap.  I'm hearing that Jun's may have closed down.  I really hope it's just a temporary or seasonal thing, because it would be a huge loss.  If you've closed down and you see this, let me know where you moved on to or where you're cooking now!  You're great!"}
{"text":"We had curry tofu and veg with black bean sauce and some spring rolls.
Everything was yummy and delivered on time and nice and hot.

Will be ordering from here again!"}
