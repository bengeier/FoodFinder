{"text":"Decided to give this new restaurant in Planet Hollywood a try for breakfast.  Food was good and wait staff was attentive.  Our only  issue was the choice of dinnerware.  The coffee cups have small round  handle high on the cup making them difficult to  hold  when full of hot beverage.  Also, the square ceramic plates have  a  tendency slip and turn on the marble table tops, especially when cutting food.  Will go there again."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles that I have ever had!  Ever! Chicken tenders were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside; waffle was fluffy. A little pricey at $18.50, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Dinner here on a Monday night while in Vegas. We had a burger and spaghetti and meatballs for our meal. The burger was described as one of the burgers she had ever eaten! My spaghetti was very good as well. Service was good, nothing special but we didn't have to wait very long and friendly service is always nice."}
{"text":"This place is off the charts! Coming back for the LA Lasagna for sure! The manager Bo was impressive and he touched every table in our area."}
{"text":"Passable breakfast since I was hungry, but I probably wouldn't come back. Granted, today is day 4 of their reopening. So maybe I would give them a second chance. 

I got the Eggs Benedict and it was just okay, especially considering it was $16. English muffins tasted a bit funny & it could've used more Hollandaise. My husband's omelette looked like it was made in a production line. Over cooked eggs that they just slapped some cheese & bacon in the middle, folded it in half and called it done. Good omelettes are fluffy and have ingredients mixed in. The sourdough toast was too thick and came out cold, so the butter didn't melt at all. Butter came from small packets & coffee creamer too. I prefer a butter dish and small pourable creamer. 

Server was very nice and took my husband's feedback on the omelette. He promised it would be better if we came back again."}
{"text":"I stayed at Planet Hollywood so it was only inevitable to find myself here at some point during my weekend stay. I actually expected this place to be complete trash but it wasn't. My husband and I ate there around 2am and we both had the french toast which was super good! They ran out of a lot of stuff on their menu but what we had was good and we will return for sure when we are back in Vegas and need a late night place to eat. Better than Hash A Go Go I'll tell you that!"}
{"text":"Short ribs were really good, they have a little kick to them. Loved, loved the chicken parmesan - not too bready"}
{"text":"Delicious food and extremely nice staff. Very accommodating, awesome ambiance, and the food was filling and large portions. I love the breakfast all day (and got a delicious eggs scramble for an early dinner)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently gone through a renovation. I think the new theme fits exactly into the Planet Hollywood theme. Very comfortable environment and the food is high quality.

More than that, the management team is extremely attentive to your needs (Stanley and Billy). Our party was checked on throughout our visit and was assured that customer service was a priority.

What made our experience truly amazing was our server, Andrea. She epitomizes what you want from a server. She was warm, personable, and polite. She took the time to get to know each of us and made a our visit memorable. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas.

5 Stars..........I would give more if possible."}
{"text":"Gordon has nothing on this place. Surf and turf jumbo shrimp and filet mignon. Abso-fricken-lootly fantastic! Yum!"}
{"text":"MUKI IS THE BEST!!!! My goodness, from the moment my family and I walked in to the moment we left Muki went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met! Al brought us our food and he had to be just as awesome as well! 

Super friendly staff and great food!? It can't get any better than that!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for mid afternoon appetizers.  The pot stickers were hard and flavorless.  The 5 cheese dip  was only about 1/2 cup and the pitas were like chewing cardboard.  I do not recommend this cafe.  It was WAY overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood has replaced Planet Dailies and is a lot nicer looking with pretty much the same menu. The walls are decorated with photos of celebrities and they have a nice display case in the middle of the restaurant with ice cream and other desserts. We came here for a late dinner after finding out that the wait was an hour for Gordon Ramsay's Burger. We were seated right away and the whole experience was just okay. Our group started with a calamari appetizer. The calamari didn't have the best taste, but the chili soy sauce that it's served with is definitely different. I ordered the club sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak. Others in our group ordered the kale salad with chicken and the the hollywood burger. The food came out in an orderly amount of time but was definitely just okay for the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, awesome coffee and supurb service.  Can't go wrong dining here.  Special shout out to the manger Kalani.  He is on his game with service."}
{"text":"Loving the new restaurant at Planet Hollywood, a fun throwback color palate from the 60s with a new design. It's diner chic. 

The menu looks simpler than it's older counterpart (Planet Dailies, RIP) but with still a lot of the same favorites as before, with a lot of amazing new breakfast, lunch and dinner dishes. Some familiar with a healthy twist. I personally love the asian section because of the ramen and Singapore noodles. The aps are all great here, fresh and clean tasting. 

And the best part it's still open 24 hours! 

With a menu like this you'll find something for everyone anytime of the day!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stanley is an awesome server! Request him. The Kale & Citrus salad was great. Out group of 9 was happy with our brunch experience."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this diner. Pictures of Hollywood movie stars are fun to look at, staff is beyond friendly, French Toast, Bacon, Pancakes, and Potato Fries are the best I ever had and I am from NJ so that is saying a lot."}
{"text":"Good buffalo wings. So-so waffle and chicken. Poke nachos is nice and hot. The hot chocolate and coffee were horrible though. Cheap, refillable soda. Very friendly staffs. Overall a nice place to dine."}
{"text":"Prior to seeing a show at Planet Hollywood, my husband and I decided to grab a quick bite. With NFR in town, we knew finding a quieter place would lead us to the quickest service in the casino. Cafe Hollywood delivered both on quickly, friendly service and good food. I was pleasantly surprised with our choice to eat here. 

Cafe Hollywood is located close to the escalators up to the Mezz level on the casino floor, tucked between a Starbucks and a bar. We were greeted by the hostess who was able to seat us immediately. She offered our choice of table or booth in a number of locations, which was lovely. We opted for a corner booth tucked in the back which gave us a big separation between the hustle and bustle of the casino. This was much appreciated. The walls were decorated with pictures of celebrities and they had TVs mounted on the wall. There is even a dessert bar in the center and an actual bar in the back left corner of the restaurant (full service of course). 

Our server arrived promptly to our table and took our drink orders. We received both our waters and beer/wine in a timely fashion. From there, the server continued to be very attentive, bringing out plenty of condiments before our meal arrived. In grand total, I think we waited 10 minutes for our food to make it to the table after ordering. The restaurant was pretty slow, so I appreciated that they still served us quickly! I enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which was quite good. It was paired with fries that really stole the show (the batter was perfect, without being too greasy). The whole time they even played a great mix of current music and fun throw backs. Overall this is a great little quick bite place to have a nice dinner prior to catching a show."}
{"text":"I had the big breakfast and my husband had the blueberry pancakes. The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood and open 24 hours. I requested a burger for breakfast they were doing breakfast only. The big breakfast came with pork sausage and pork bacon. No turkey or chicken products. They
 did let  me substitute apiece of chicken for the pork meat at  no extra cost.   The food was hot which I like because when you sit in a restaurant I expect my food the come out hot. The pancakes were big enough to share. The restaurant being in the tourist area they should  have other meat products for breakfast other than steak. The service was great."}
{"text":"Servers were nice but very disorganized and confused. Order took an extremely long time to come out. We went for the fun milkshakes with a slice of cake. They looked nowhere near as pretty as the photos. The milkshake itself was awful and the cake was dense and dry. All for $16 per shake. We will never go back."}
{"text":"went there a week ago for breakfast w/ 3 friends.  the food was right on point.  good quality and priced fine even for LV on the strip.  i had the ham and eggs.  came with a very good ham steak and 2 eggs and the bread they used for the toast was so good - def homemade for sure or at least tasted like it.

only bad thing is they didnt have spicy mustard or franks red hot.  both should be staples everywhere.  shocked they didnt have.  big pet peeve of mine!

but overall i highly recommed this place for b-fast!!!   GOOD EATS!"}
{"text":"I liked the food here with the exception of the pancakes.  The pancakes were \"hard\" on the top possibly suggestion it was under the heat lamp too long.  I had the Big breakfast and everything else was top shape.  Price was \"casino\" price."}
{"text":"It's formally Planet Dailies, which I had been to multiple times. Café Hollywood is it's revamped and remodeled version with a bakery in the bar area in there now. Honestly, I miss Planet Dailies. Menu  had some old favorites, but food is ok and service is just ok as well. I guess they just opened up a few months ago, service is kinda slow. Our group ordered a few items, but they didn't rave too much about their meals. The high roller sampler seems overpriced for $35 for average food. The Kobe Burger my wife and I shared wasn't bad. I don't know if we'd come back, however. Especially when Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  The service was fine; it was kind of slow in the restaurant.  I had the LA Lasagna, it wasn't that good.  I wouldn't order it again.  I might stop by again in the future, I just won't be ordering the lasagna."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick lunch before we headed to the airport for our flight home. The food is a little pricey, but is presented beautifully. The service is pretty bad.  I had the \"World famous Chicken Crunch\" and my guest had the \"Honey Walnut Shrimp\". The chicken was a little too sweet for me and I ate half. My guest really liked the \"Honey Walnut Shrimp\".  We were never offered refills on drinks or carryout boxes. Our waitress greeted us, brought our food and then disappeared until she brought our check.  Cafe Hollywood worked in a pinch, but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here on 2/21/18 after Jennifer Lopez 's show. One server took our order and then another one showed up with our drinks after like around 10 minutes. We ordered the citrus salad and 2 burgers. The salad came first and no plates to share , I asked for them and we didn't use them because again they took quite of time bringing them. Later the server wanted to give us the check.. what about our burgers? The first server who took our order forgot to fire the food.. so we waited 20 more minutes...not good . Of course the server apologized but please have more communication between you guys!"}
{"text":"I was sceptical at first because i am not impressed by many casino diners. This restaurant was a great stop before o ended my vacation in Vegas. The pancakes were probably the 2nd best pancakes I have had in my life. I wish I could have finished them all or take them with me. Great portion size for the price and excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant and eat here again on my next trip."}
{"text":"This might have been the worst service I've had for just a milkshake. Our server Angel took forever and didn't give my change back till I asked for it and gypped me of 36¢ of my change. On top of that the milkshake was subpar and the lollipop that was on top was not even half the size of the one in the picture or one other tables got."}
{"text":"Favorite place of all time to eat with my family. Atmosphere is very friendly and vibrant! My boyfriend and I had the High roller and it was delicious and very fulfilling! Delicious mimosa as well! Our waiter Jarret was very friendly and always came to check on us and see how everything was going. Worth of penny to eat here!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick joint to eat that that's close to the different entertainment areas of planet Hollywood, I definitely think that this is the place to stop by. The vibe is very pleasant, the really friendly staff. The food options are excellent because they hire well priced and they also offer a lot of options depending on what you want. It's great they have all day breakfast options, lots of lunch options, and lots of dinner and dessert options. They seem to be very famous for their shakes so I definitely recommend getting that. I also really loved the strawberry salad with blue cheese, and definitely the pasta ziti. I think the best thing over all was definitely the crème brûlée. You have to try it! The service was quick and very helpful staff. I also think that they had great dessert and bakery options in the front but didn't really check them out because I was being seated at the table."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first time eating here. Stan was great and the food was delicious. Craving Ceasar Chicken Salad this whole Vegas trip, I'm glad to have my first one here. Expected more like potato skins, but got more like potato wedges, still good. Probably won't get them next time. I would love to have had desserts, but opt out, since we were going to have dinner in 3 hours. Not sure if it's 24 hours, but it would be good, since the menu for breakfast looked just as good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here randomly with my mom when she visited town. My mom had the fried lasagna and I had the pork belly ramen. Both very delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Below average food. Decor OK.  There are dozens of better restaurants close by"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be comparing this restaurant to the previous Planet Dailies that it replaced. I'll just say that the PD menu had much more offerings and nicer selections than Cafe Hollywood.  Wife and I had one breakfast and one dinner here. The restaurant is nice and bright and the tables are spaced nicely apart. Food was good, maybe even a little above average. Breakfast service was very good, dinner service somewhat lacking as it took a very long time to get and pay our check. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but if you're staying at PH then it will suffice as a place to eat."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with a cool theme. Waiter was nice and friendly. Our waiter continued to check our water cups and let us be without bugging us. Service was fast and the western omelette was cooked to perfection (peppers were soft and onions were transluent).

Would recommend this place to anyone (especially those who like breakfast all day)."}
{"text":"The floors were filthy but tables were clean. They had a guy cleaning tables but no one was sweeping all the fries and crumbs coming off the tables. It was an open atmosphere and servers were fast. Food came out at a decent time but wasn't warm. I loved the Croissant French Toast! My husband liked the Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"We just went to the Cafe Hollywood and ordered just chicken wings and queso dip (appetisers). We waited over half an hour with no sign of the food, so ended up walking out. The server told us after 15 minutes that the food would be out in a couple of minutes. When we asked her again after another 10 minutes she told us the food \"should have been out by now\" but there was still no sign of the food. Yes, the place was busy, but over half an hour with still no sign of 2 appetisers?!? Really not good."}
{"text":"This place had just opened right before our trip and even with very few reviews or pictures, the menu on the website looked promising. We had a reservation for breakfast and were instantly seated. It was super easy to find the place as it was right outside the elevators to our rooms.

The menu is huge and half of me was bummed we'd only be eating here for breakfast when I saw what they had to offer for lunch or dinner. I got the Southwest scramble (scrambled eggs mixed with chorizo, avocado, cheddar/monterey cheese, and pico de gallo with a slice of sourdough toast and potatoes) and my husband got the big breakfast (pancakes, potatoes, bacon, sausage, and scrambled eggs). There was so much food we weren't hungry until dinner. The staff were super friendly and the service was great. If I were staying at this hotel I would definitely eat their again."}
{"text":"Im happy I can grab some waffles and fried chicken when I'm hungry. It taste awesome. I'll be back for sure.."}
{"text":"A year ago I fell in love with Planet Dailies country fried steak and was bummed to find out they closed. I was happily relived to find out Cafe Hollywood was basically a reborn version.

The decor is way better than planet dailies and the seating was super comfortable. The prices are pretty reasonable. The look of the menus were a little disappointing. Way oversized, floppy and kind of cheap feeling.

Our waiter Jose was super nice and had a great personality. Although it took a little while  to get some service as it seemed no one knew who should be servicing our table.

All and all a great place to check out if your are in the area looking for good food for a good price."}
{"text":"WARNING! Do not eat here! Horrible food & management! My table ordered 3 pork belly ramen, 1 burger, and 1 tiramisu. All bowls of ramen came out cold, we had to send them back. On top of that 2 other tables next to us had to send theirs back too! If you are Asian or have ever had ramen from a restaurant you will think theirs is gross. Even top ramen or cup of noodles tastes better than theirs. Don't let the pictures fool you. The tiramisu was dry like it had been under a fan all day. It should ALWAYS be moist. If that isn't bad enough there was a piece of REAL CARDBOARD INSIDE MY BURGER!!! 

Anthony the server was great, attentive, and apologetic. It wasn't his fault. The manager Eddie came over and asked if I wanted something else. I was afraid to try any other disappointments from them so I said no and he walked away! He never introduced himself as the manager, I had to ask someone else. And HE NEVER APOLOGIZED! What kind of restaurant manager does that?! The manager, server, and cook has to work as a team. If only 1 of the 3 does their job the customers suffer. He took the drinks, burger and tiramisu off our bill. He should've comped the entire tab. When hanging out with family in Vegas we will avoid this place at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Came there for a take out... Ordered a sandwich, two lattes and a slice of cake. The cashier asked whether I wanted everything together and I said yes. Two minutes later my lattes arrive, the first cup is 50% and the other 80% full. For the sandwich they tell me to wait for 15 minutes. 7-10 minutes later they bring the ugly plastic bag with my order. I take it to my room and realize they never put the cake in there. The total for all of this was slightly over $30. Very very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Love the new renovation, menu is still similar to the old cafe. But the wait time for the food to come out is ridiculously long. Even if you just order 1 thing, even if there's only 1-2 other tables here, It'll still take them 30+minutes to bring your food out. At least the food semi decent, but it can be because they made you wait so long for it. 
Don't eat here if you are short on time, you'll forsure be late."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast on the way out of Vegas.  Complimentary champagne with coupon from Planet Hollywood room!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the criteria for hotel restaurant in Las Vegas are suitable convenience and relative affordability. Recently renovated, and now opened for 24 hours, this brightly blue and spacious cafe serves up a decent variety of food that should satiate your palate in the midst of late night. This modern take of a diner hosts a plentiful number of tables, so your dominating worry would be the wait on the food. 

While the service is slow, presumably still fresh from its recent opening and training, the decor is wonderfully new, with walls swamped with nostalgic photos from the days of the Planet Hollywood restaurant fad. But of course, you're not here for the ambiance.The simple menu is mostly comprised of the typical menu from your American dining restaurant, but with small section for Asian fares. 

-Fried Calamari: Simple and enough for 3 or 4 people, the dish could benefit from more scallions and toppings.
-Citrus Kale: Decent amount of cheese and nuts, this salad has a brings a tart balance with crunchy texture every bite.
-Singapore Noodles: The best dish ordered, this bowl of noodles combines thinly sliced vegetables with dry curry powder, aromatic and stimulating.
-Pork Belly Ramen: The dish does not look like picture, and carries a slightly salty taste with a soup based seemingly flooded with a soy sauce bottle. There are definitely better dishes on the menu. 
-Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: Blend and slightly dry, this dish definitely should include more pasta, as you would feel hungry after devouring this dish. The placement of the herb might look enticing, but would be more flavourful if chopped and sprinkled over the dish.
-Thai Basil Chicken: Though slightly chewy, the chicken is certainly filling, but could be more flavourful with more basil, which isn't even sliced. 
-BBQ Ribs: Quite filling with soft and tender texture that easily falls apart with a bite. This is the second best dish ordered, more than expected that my table of 8 couldn't even finish! 

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Environment: 4/5

If you're like me, instead of nitpicking over the acceptable variety of food here, you'll probably be more bothered by the useless lamps hanging, over every table, that provides practically no luminosity (hence the poor lightning and focus for my photos). But be prepared, the food won't look the same as the photos on the menu."}
{"text":"Went in for a Saturday night meal.  Was by myself and there were plenty of two top tables available but the staff seated me at a split booth with a couple on the other half of the booth.  The place have a number of TV screens around as well as pictures of Hollywood stars.  The TV across the room had a game on that I wanted to watch and an available two top table.  I asked if I could move to see the game and the staff said no problem since I hadn't ordered.  They then took and seated me not at the two top table but at another split booth with another couple on the other half of the booth.  Strange.  As for the food the Rueben Sandwich, it was very good.  the sauce was served on the side and the rye bread was mild but flavorful. The fries, while not piping hot were tasty and crisp."}
{"text":"Breakfast sounds so good l,but it's dinner time. In a major where can I find amazing breakfast food for dinner. Oh, that's right this is Las Vegas! Using my handy Yelp app and my handy Google senses I find what I am seeking. It's off to the Planet Hollywood for dinner. 

This cafe is rather large and it sits in the beautiful Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. When I walked into the cafe I was expecting average and wow, I was blown away by the atmosphere here. The wonderful desserts that they are selling are such great eye candy. Although this trip to the cafe I am taking in the breathtaking deserts from afar. These desserts although are probably heaven would destroy all the hard work that I have done thus far. I had bacon and eggs instead; this is at least good for you.

The service was great and so was the team work between the employees. I decided to take my order to go. After I placed my order in real life I had a little wait. I went over to the casino bar for a drink before going home. When I came back my order was all ready to go. Of course, I check it all was perfect with the order and the fabulous smells coming from the box. They even remembered silverware and napkins too!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy a 24 hr coffee shop/diner.  Reminds me of NYC where many restaurants are open late or all night. This place did not disappoint.  

The almond tarte was very good.  Coffee was surprisingly delicious.  When I asked our server, Christian F., for the name of the coffee, he went back to the kitchen and then showed me a picture he took of the brand.  It was \"Folgers!\"  Really?! 

My husband and I shared the pork belly ramen and combination fried rice.  Soup was tasty and the fried rice was not bad for a non-Chinese restaurant.  

Considering that it was a busy night, I give kudos to our server, Christian.  He was very attentive!"}
{"text":"This place is so not worth of a place to eat...we ordered Hong Kong Wonton Soup and Pancakes, the Wonton wasn't cooked all the way, waiter spilled soup,  we had to ask for butter for the pancakes.  When he brought it out, butter was very cold.  Also, at evening time, we ordered blue berry pancakes to g and when waiter brought it out, to go box was tilted so I opened it front of them and guess what...inside the to go box, they put pancakes, blueberry sauce together along with syrup container and individual packed butters.  So...blueberry sauce was all over them.  It looked very  discusting!!!   They didnt even bother to apologize.  This place needs lots of  improvements...I really mean alot...seriously, \"Ihope\" restaurant is way better place to eat and price are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place !!!! Thanks to Sean !! I will definitely be back because of him!!! Amazing guy great place and atmosphere. Great experience in Vegas :))"}
{"text":"The Service: Prompt service. Even there is waiting/seating area for to-go. 

The Food: Love their burgers! Good quality ingredients. Good size burger too. Price is reasonable. Definitely have to try their dessert too. Huge portion, perfect to share~

The Parking: Hotel parking lot"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before an event.  Love the new look and feel to the restaurant.  Much more inviting and fun.  We ordered a few cocktails, the kobe sliders, and the potato wedges.  The food took a bit to arrive at our table, however, it was delicious!  The prices are a bit high for the portion size (sliders were $17 and potato wedges were $12), however, we will definitely be back.  There is also a small bar towards the back of the restaurant as well as a take-out counter in the middle.  Our next goal is try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great service, great breakfast! We got the banana split French toast and cinnamon roll French toast! They were delicious!"}
{"text":"I had points to burn so I came here for dinner! Omg! Their Southwest burger is DELICIOUS! Very juicy... full of yummy avocado. It also had 2 deep fried jalapeño slices, cheese, pico de Gallo and this delicious slaw.. The slaw had a distinctive citrus flavor and it really set the burger off, This burger scores high in originality, concerning its taste. Interestingly, this burger was wayyy better that the burger I once had at Gordon Ramsey's. Go figure! 

Diner is cute & filled with celebrity photos on the wall. My Caesars salad wasn't too good. I didn't eat it because I was full from my burger.. but even if I wasn't I probably wouldn't have eaten it all. It was edible but greens could have been a little more fresh and should have included romaine lettuce-and the dressing could have used some work too.

Service was good, but kinda slow. May have seemed that way because I was super hungry.

For a cafe, this place is somewhat pricey. (Like most are on the 50 yard line of the strip) However, I don't mind paying for the burger that I had because it was just that good. 

So glad that I found yet another great restaurant in Vegas to frequent. I absolutely loved that burger and will go out of the way to have it again in Vegas. The burger is definitely worthy of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Late night of partying or gambling? This might be the go to spot. Slow service, long food wait times, the usual 24 hour restaurant experience. 

American food is alright, but stay away from the asian cuisine especially the pork belly ramen. That was an insult to food in general. Imagine a can of chicken noodle soup, now pour a cup of water into it. That's what it tasted like.

Well when in Vegas, take your gamble. Good luck and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great tasting dishes!  The menu is extensive and you'll find something for everyone's taste.  The wait staff were friendly and efficient.  No big complaints, if I had to give a suggestion it would be to have a friendlier host staff.  We don't normally eat meat and this splurge was worth it!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood took the place of Planet Dailies which was a great place. This was my first trip to Cafe Hollywood. One of the first things I noticed was the decor. The walls were plastered with older pictures of stars, which fits with theme but almost gave the place a clustered feel. I would maybe scale back on some of the pictures, it just was kinda overwhelming. 
One of the best specials at the previous establishment was the steak and eggs. I think Cafe Hollywood needs to bring that back. 
I had the chicken and waffles, I should say the tender and waffles. True chicken and waffles should be actual chicken and not tenders. However, I will admit it was good all things considered. My wife had the omelet with toast. Again nothing spectacular but decent overall. 
Cafe Hollywood is a nice stop but it won't be in my regular rotation of places to eat while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Basic cafe with unreasonable prices. Even for Vegas. I had toast, one egg, and sausage. The sausage was inedible. The egg was fine, a basic scrambled egg and the toast was toast. Nothing special. I also ordered a glass of cab which I thought while drinking \"this is not good.\" Turns out that crappy cab was $41 a glass. Honestly I had better wine for free at the tables. Over $60 for a blah small meal. Service existed but that was it. Everyone was too busy watching the hockey game."}
{"text":"I would just like to say that this place does not respect alcohol laws. My boyfriend went in there the other night and had been drinking before he got there (clearly drunk when I last saw him and his friends) and the bar tender according to the receipt let him have multiple shots and beers. the bartender \"T\" should not be allowed to serve alcohol if she will just serve to anyone. Now we have to pay room damages for him coming into the hotel room heavily intoxicated and breaking memorabilia. TERRIBLE IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR FROM THIS PLACE TO OVERSERVE SOMEONE!!!"}
{"text":"So let me start with the positives the service was exceptional and I was happy with how fast my food was brought out. My issue though was that my waffle was soggy because there was so much fruit on top of it. I was also disappointed that it was more of a jam not fresh fruit.  It still tasted good and I'd eat here again I would just order something else.  Prices are okay for being a restaurant inside of a casino."}
{"text":"I've eaten here two nights in a row and it doesn't disappoint. Stopped in for a late night sweet and they had everything from macaroons, gelato, tarts, cakes and pastries to charred vegetables and bagels. I got the chocolate cake to go and they even made it look sublime inside a box! One slice Is big enough to share...but don't expect to have leftovers. I scooped the crumbs off the bottom. It was that good."}
{"text":"I ask the waiter to add extra seasoning to my burger meat and he said they don't have any seasoning that I could add salt and pepper after  we order a milkshake and they were out of vanilla ice cream"}
{"text":"A retro 50's styled diner, much like the ones you've been to in every city everywhere. This is one of the ones that has the ridiculously over-the-top shakes with cakes and candies and rocketships and junglegyms hanging off of the carafe of cold, coagulated cream. We did not order one.
We were there for breakfast. I was hungover and ordered appropriately: bagel and lox with bacon!!! Everything was perfect, especially Cayle's food. She had the chicken fried steak, which was ACTUALLY a steak, and not some beatup chewedup cud. The gravy had good flavor, and I ABSOLUTELY HATE breakfast gravy, so that's quite an achievement. The portions were enormous, and she had that look like if we were staying another day, it would've made the ride back up to the room with us.
The waitress was sweet and fantastic and so quick, the whole meal was over before it started. Well done."}
{"text":"I miss planet dailies... I am not a fan of this place at all.  The family was hungry and I remembered PH had a great diner spot.  To my surprise this new spot stood in its place.  Can you cheery???!!  Photos of celebrities all over the place, no thanks but I was stuck, the wife and kids were hungry.  The meal comes out and follows the experience up to that point.  Terrible, Overpriced and bland.  I have no issue paying up for resort/hotel food but at least have it be good.  So disappointed and will never come back here."}
{"text":"Convenient spot for a bite anytime of the day. Today, we came here for breakfast and yesterday we stopped by for late lunch (we're staying at the hotel Planet Hollywood). We were seated promptly both times, mind you, these are during weekdays and not during high peak season.

Really nice folks serving us and the menu is your standard \"all American\" offering. The burger w/fries was delicious. Salmon toast with avacado was recomneded by our server and that was right on."}
{"text":"When the restaurant isnt busy and you still feel like your getting rushed thru a to go order, just to have your order come out missing stuff and ranch spilled all over the bottom of the bag. Not really good buisness, especially having prices comparable to gordon ramsay. And the food looked like crap."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, this was the perfect spot for my husband and I to grab a bite to eat after visiting the Grand Canyon. We were tired and hungry. There is no dress code for this low keyed restaurant. There was no wait at 9:30pm at night.  They made our food super fast. AND THE CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST WAS AMAZING!! I would highly recommend if wanting to grab a quick bite to eat at a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Hubby was sad to see Planet Dallies go, and had high hopes for Cafe Hollywood. We decided to get breakfast here around 11am on a Sunday, we were seated after a 3 minute wait. 

They have a pretty extensive menu, similar to Planet Daillies. We decided on breakfast. I had the egg white omelet, and hubby had the Big Breakfast. Both were good. 

My only complaint was on the slowness of the waiters. It took about 10 minutes to order, around 20 minutes to get our food, and about another 20 minutes after our plates were taken away to get our check. THEN...another 15 minutes until (and asking 3 different people) to take our check! Not sure why our waiter kept skipping out on our table, I saw him talking to his other tables.

Decor, BRIGHT! Definitely loved the decor. Planet Daillies was always very dark hidden. Cafe Hollywood is definitely the opposite, you can't miss this place!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here and we stopped in for an appetizer and some dessert. We got a large portion of the loaded nachos which were great. To finish we got the brownie cheesecake jar and the creme brûlée ... both were very satisfying. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service was VERY slow . Although it was busy, we were there for nearly 2 hours waiting on 3 alcoholic drinks , waters , the nachos and dessert ."}
{"text":"Very slow service. We only ordered one order of chicken fingers and Mac and cheese and it took forever. We noticed everyone was waiting awhile for their food. It was okay- nothing special."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 Star review but I was very disappointed with my food. I ordered the honey walnut glazed shrimp. They put way to much of the glaze on It. It was way too sweet to the point where It was unenjoyable. It came with a huge portion of plain white bland rice. This dish is an epic fail and should be removed from the menu. It's that bad! I ended up asking to substitute the rice for asparagus. The asparagus was cooked to perfection with a tasty garlic butter coating over It. That sauce would have gone great with some sautéed shrimp. I hope this is an option on the menu when I come back. 

 Our server Themistocles was awesome. Thanks to him, he made sure that my husband was able to order what he wanted even after It was too late to order the breakfast item he wanted (biscuits and gravy) which he rated a 7 out of 10.

Overall, the service was great which is why I will give this place another chance the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"They recently remolded the entire restaurant it looks great now. All the servers there, especially Stanley, Alan, Min, and Austin are always attentive and professional. The managers there are great too. They have a new dessert bar and the creme brulee was delicious. I had the loco moco and my boyfriend had the ginger salmon. Both great choices."}
{"text":"They seated us and we waited at our table for 20 minutes before we finally flagged someone down to take our order and get us some waters and coffee. We then waited 45 minutes for our food. Toast with no butter so we asked the waiter for ketchup and butter....he forgot and we waited another ten, flagged down someone else to bring us butter and ketchup...then he took another ten minutes. Needless to say good thing we weren't in a hurry because the service was terrible. If it wasn't for the manager who took our order we probably would of gotten up and left while we were waiting for the ketchup the second time. I understand being low on staff but, this was just ridiculous. I'm sorry but, i will never go here again. Food was so so."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've ever had. Great drink selections and a versatile menu especially when you're not trying to spend $200 on a meal."}
