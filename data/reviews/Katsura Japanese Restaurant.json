{"text":"Very disappointing sushi and very expensive. Slow but friendly service. A dark decor. Not a good experience -- we would not return."}
{"text":"Katsura delivers solid food, however some slight drawbacks holds the restaurant from being great. 

The service is very slow. I have visited the restaurant on both quiet weekdays and busy weekends and I still find this to be the case. This restaurant is also quite pricey in terms of what you can get elsewhere for similar cost. The biggest problem for me is that the tea and water to taste like soap - either the teapot or the cups are not rinsed thoroughly... this is extremely off putting and hard to ignore when evaluating any restaurant.  

Despite the aforementioned issues, I like the food that the kitchen puts out. It may not be the absolute best in Toronto, but it definitely sits high above average. The grilled eel rice stands out for me for being a little bit different with the hit of wasabi and scallions, and it is definitely one of my favourites at this restaurant. Sashimi and sushi are hit and miss, but when they get it right it is delicious. 

Hopefully they can address the slow service and soap-tasting water and tea. These are easily fixable and can make the overall dining experience much better.

{"text":"First, be prepared - this place is very pricy. But everyone needs to treat themselves from time to time. They do have a \"Winterlicious\" feature that is very reasonable. The food here is seriously outstanding!  Seasoning was perfectly balanced and it all just tasted so FRESH.  We had some maki and sashimi. We stayed until closing and never felt rushed, our server ensured that we had fresh tea even after we paid. Atmosphere was very calm. They also have rooms with a hostess (geisha?), but that is out of my price-line even on a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, and only to the teppanyaki area.   There are options to order teppanyaki a-la-carte, or a prix fixe menu.  The prix fixe menu starts from $68 and upwards to $110 (per person).  On sundays, there is the combination prix fixe special for $35.  Note: there are only 2 prix fixe dinners, if it isn't sunday.

I had the combination platter at $35, and surely, it was decent.  This is the restaurant of the Westin Hotel, and obviously can't be terrible.  Keeping that in mind, I figure the whole point of a teppanyaki was the show.  The special things that chefs should do to make the experience unique and creative.  As the other reviewer said, they are \"pros\" at juggling their salt and pepper mills.  Aside from that, not much more.  I was a little disappointed in the showmanship.  The chefs were really nice and friendly, but for the lowly  $68 prix fix dinner, it's not worth it.  I've been to other teppanyaki places where the chefs do neat things with all their cooking utensils to show off their skills.  such as, balancing an egg on the tip of their spatula, or dishing out food right into the mouth of a willing audience member, etc.  I'd have to give a thumbs down for their showmanship. 

Foodwise, the quality of the meats and vegetables were unmistakably top grade, and cooked well.

p.s. you need to pay for parking, with a $2 discount off your bill when you provide the ticket stub."}
{"text":"Major disappointment!!! The food was so bad I had to return my entree! We ordered both the dinner room menu and tepanyakki.  We have tried all of the tapanyakki places in Toronto and I would say This place is one of the worst and way over priced for the amount of food you get per order, the food is tasteless and you have to dip constantly in the sauce.  On top of that the restaurant is very outdated and depressing.  Do not waste your money coming here, being a high end restaurant, they definitely did not make any effort to provide the quality that reflect their pricing.  We would genuinely recommend the one in yorkville Toronto or try Iron Chef in Mississauga - it's the best! (The black cod at iron chef is amazing!!)"}
{"text":"Summing up: extremely overpriced, indifferent service, airport hotel atmosphere and average-at-best sushi. It reminds me of hotel restaurants before hotel restaurants figured out it is important to have a good restaurant. $100 per head for a meal that can be had anywhere in the city for the $12 bento box special. 

Stay away if you can."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  As I consider myself quite experienced in the sushi realm, I was incredibly dissatisfied after my current experience with Katsura.  

As I entered the establishment, the  ambience was sub par.  There was nothing authentic, trendy, or classy about it.  There were children literally SCREAMING in the restaurant, which, when you're paying $100 per person, is less than desirable.  I mean, I'm not at Chuck-E-Cheese.

The menu was incredibly limited- especially considering this establishment considers themselves a sushi restaurant-- they didn't even have a proper sushi menu.  We ordered the \"Chef's Special\" nigiri-- and it was atrocious.  The fish was not fresh, and certainly not tasty.  In fact, my date compared this supposedly \"upscale restaurant\" to a \"dollar-a scoop\" quality eatery.

We also ordered the lobster/filet entree.  One would think that a surf 'n turf item would be one of the best on the menu.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  It was seasoned poorly, and we left more on the plate than we ate which I NEVER do with surf n turf.

If the food wasn't bad enough, the terrible service sealed the deal.  I sat for an HOUR with an empty glass of water-- and couldn't even get the server to pay attention enough to order more sake.  My credit card sat on the table for about 15 minutes before we received a check.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but with the screaming children and terrible food I couldn't have escaped sooner!

If it's quality Japanese food you're looking for, please do yourself a favor and DO NOT go to Katsura.  I wish someone had given me the same advise, saving me $200, an evening of terrible food, and crappy ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my third time having dinner here.  The quality is good and tasty.  I likevthis place a lot."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday yesterday. During dessert, a worker came out in a HAZMAT SUIT to begin cleaning the grilling stations. True store. Super sketchy! 

We immediately started to regret eating here, if it takes such powerful chemicals to clean the place. Also, couldn't the restaurant just wait until customers had left, to begin cleaning...

Service was incredibly slow. It took 30 minutes after being seated, just for drink orders. The restaurant was empty. Probably should have been a sign.

I would suggest going to Akasaka in Richmond Hill next time. The show at the Teppanyaki tables are more of a show at Akasaka."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, they have the best quality fish in Toronto hands down! Their service is impeccable and the relaxed ambiance of the restaurant makes the experience so enjoyable. I definitely recommend the uni hand roll if you don't mind paying $15 for it!"}
{"text":"We ate there during the Summerlicious for their lunch menu.

When we first got there it took a little while for the hostess to notice us, and the waitress (the only one to serve everyone in the entire resturant) seems to be stressed most of the time. We tried the summerlicious lunch menu. After asking us for drinks we didn't get it until we prompted her again after our soup was served. In the bento box the fish is ok and the tofu was meh, but nothing outstanding overall. 

The dessert, which I choose the Anmitsu, was disappointing, as it was basically a blob of red bean paste right on top of the little cubes of agar jello. 

When we got our bill we are suprised to find that the tea cost $3 per person (which 4 us comes to $12 for the whole pot!), which is rather expensive!"}
{"text":"Absolute perfection! 

Best service and friendly staff and the food was very delicious. 
I had ordered teppanyaki  set (sea food and vegetables) and sushi set. Not only the chef did a great job in preparation of the meal, the presentation of the food and attending to all customers were done in a timely and professional manner. ( not to mention, It was very entertaining as well- see photos )


It's a little bit pricy but I think it's very well worth it."}
{"text":"What do I do when I am craving yummy Japanese food, but don't feel like going all the way downtown to Nami? Katsura.

Intro. It has been almost 5-6 years since my family last went to Katsura. I briefly read other reviews and have to agree that there was a period of demise for Katsura. There was the before period when I was still in high school and going to Katsura meant getting authentic, fresh, and delicious Japanese food. Whether it was the Gindara, the chicken terriyaki, black sesame ice cream or being served by dainty and flighty Japanese waitresses dressed in Kimonos, Katsura could do no wrong. Then, I believe there was a change in ownership and the quality of the food went to the hole. There was even talk of the changed ownership demanding that the sushi bar be removed (equivalent to going to a baseball game and having the concession foods removed). I still remember that fateful day when my dad felt like eating Chicken Terriyaki and it was so unbelievably dry and tasteless, that the price, or experience, was not worth it for us to go to Katsura again.

Fast forward to yesterday. When my dad called to make reservations, the head poncho screamed hello and thought we were kidnapped as a reason for our absence. He then proceeded to tell the waitresses Guess Who's Coming to Dinner - it was a BIG family reunion of sorts. And now for the test - was the food still bad? 

Food. I am glad to report, the food was delicious. We were there to celebrate a birthday so my dad ordered various appetizers including beef sashimi (tender and juicy, equivalent to eating beef tartare), a sushi boat (featuring fresh spicy tuna maki, hamachi, toro, maguro, squid with salmon roe, and raw shrimp - good to order so that everyone at the table can sample different sushi and sashimi), the usual vegetables (aka tempura), and blue tuna spicy and California hand rolls. The seafood was incredibly tasty and fresh - you do not have to worry about any \"fishy\" tasting foods (although ironically, what you're eating is fish but it's not supposed to taste fishy...go figure).

The selection of appetizers was just enough to let everyone at the table have a small main course. My mom and I shared an appetizer portion of the Gindara which is a juicy and tender black cod fish. Katsura also has the main course portion of the Gindara so depending on how much omega's you want to eat, you have the option of appetizer or main course serving. My dad had the tempura udon and the noodles had a bit of bounce and bite to them, just the way noodles are supposed to be.

I was anxious for Katsura. In addition to my dad and family, I am sure we were not the only customers the restaurant lost to bad food that was expensive. But redemption is here and we will be going to Katsura, I suspect, more often. 

Ambiance. The restaurant is inside the Prince Hotel, although the glass corridor that connects Katsura to the hotel is currently under renovation. There is the main dining room and the teppenyaki area. My family and I have never ate at the teppenyaki area of the restaurant...we do not need to see chefs juggling eggs and pepper shakers - we will leave that for the cirque du soleil. The main dining room is spacious and elegantly decorated. There are two traditional dining rooms where guests take shoes off before entering. Great for special party dinners or families requiring a bit more privacy.

We were not disappointed with Katsura. The quality of food is absolutely there. The restaurant is more on the expensive side but value is there. When the food is brought out, you can see the attention to detail - nothing is amiss.

Welcome back Katsura."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Katsura many times, and recently went back after a Hiatus of 10 - 15 years.  This recent is an authentic Japanese restaurant, and used to be the only one in the North York area.  

In the past, when you ate at the Teppanyaki table, you would get an inclusive dinner.... salad, main course, dessert.  Now, it is all a la carte.... Given the mains are approx. $40 - $65, salads $15 - $20, sushi $20+ the dinner adds up quickly.  For four of us (three drinking wine), the bill was $340.    The food was delicious, the service really sucked.  Chef was a little low key for Teppanyaki (which was ok in my mind), there was several types of beef, sushi grade fish etc...

One guest ordered Salmon, the rest ordered beef.  For some reason, the chef miscalculated the time to cook the salmon, and the rest of us had our meat long before the salmon was finished... a good 5 - 10 minutes... which wasn't right.  Then, we had all pretty much finished our dinner... and all of a sudden, he puts this huge mass of bean sprouts on, cooks them, and serves up to our pretty much empty plates....  I am not sure if he forgot them, but would have been better just to leave out at that point, rather them dump them on our plates!

Given the dollar amount of the meal, I would expect very good service.  The waitress came quickly, brought our drink orders very fast - so I was really impressed... thinking things were good!  We never saw her again for 20+ minutes.  Finally, when the chef started to bring thing over to the table to get ready to cook, I sought out the waitress and reminded her we were still waiting for appetizers (over $70 worth).  She made a comment about the sushi chef being really busy, but then brought them right away..... so they had obviously been sitting there waiting....  After that, she was downright sullen  We never saw again for quite some time, and to be honest, she started removing my appetizer plate before I was finished...  She bumped into one of our guests, and never apologized.... never came back to pour wine etc.  She never smiled, and had quite the snotty / cranky look on her face... We had to chase her down for the bill etc..

For $340, I expect and deserve more.

The restaurant was  half empty... so there was really no excuse for the bad service.    There are several Teppanyaki restaurants in the area now (two very close on Don Mills Road), and while most of the staff working in them are Chinese, and the food probably not quite as high quality, they are busy, and the overall experience is great.  Dinner in either one is usually around $30 - 35, includes everything, so  I think a lot of people have moved their business to these alternatives.  Katsura would be great, and super busy if it maintained it position as a classy, quiet, high quality food and service restaurant....  However, they are only meeting a few of these points now.    Given the overall experience, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"In search for a decent place for Teppanyaki we settled on this spot as the other option was quite a bit further up north.
We were a mid sized group and had reserved in advance. Walking in I was taken aback by the size of the place and number of teppanyaki tables they had here. I counted at least 6 though though I could have easily have missed a couple since the place is huge. There are some big communal style table and then there are somewhat smaller enclosed area should you decide to have a more private dinning experience. 
The menu is quite extensive and they include quite a few staple dishes associated with this cuisine. Teppanyaki options consist of set menus and  À la carte. 
There is a Set Menu  has the following and is only served on Sundays. 
Salad, Soup Teppanyaki main plate that consists of Chicken, Beef, Scallops, Zucchini, Onions and mushrooms with a single scoop of ice cream to finish the dinner. It seemed reasonable as it covered all the bases. 
Even though it was Sunday the place quickly filled up from what seemed like regulars. 
The chef arrived with our stuff and quickly started to cook. Other than the volcano onion there wasn't much of showman ship here (popularized by a chain that has made this kind of food mainstream) and it ended up rather quickly. There wasn't much interaction with the diners just cook and serve. 
All this would have been OK if the food was good but alas it didn't improve the impression. Here is a blow by blow
Salad: Veggies were fresh but drowned in an odd oily dressing.
Soup: Egg drop was decent
Main attraction: very average IMO. Steak was OK chicken was white meat and even though advertised as fresh I doubt it was organic as it was bland. Scallops were OK.
Service was OK as well. Decent selection of sake while a predictable selection for beer.
All said and done I would say 2.5 stars for teppanyaki."}
{"text":"One of the first \"fine dining\" operations that I ever ate at. It helped me understand the true meaning of refined cuisine. However, I think it is important to mention that I ate here many years ago and things may have changed since then. One large setback is the high prices they charge, which may not necessarily make up for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Came here with my designated sushi friend. He ordered the summerlicious menu while I ordered the Omakase sushi, and we shared a spicy spider roll.

Omakase sushi included 10 pieces of sushi for 43 dollars. Spider roll was 15 dollars. Here's a summary of my impressions.
- Omakase sushi was decently priced. Included Toro, Uni, Real Crab sushi (my friend and I were wondering whether it was snow crab or king crab. Regardless, it wasn't the imitation crab meat), giant clam, scallop, and yellow tail. I liked the fact that it included many ones that I like.
- On the downside, Omakase sushi did not come with soup or dessert, but I knew that.
- Spider roll, while nice and crunchy, was overpriced.
- At the teppanyaki table, I think the chef didn't really put on as big of a show as I thought. Last time I was at Akasaka up at richmond hill, the chef was putting on a big show with every patron at the table.
- Green tea is $2. :/

Overall: Great sushi, but a bit overpriced.

Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 7/10. Overall 8/10"}
{"text":"This is a Japanese restaurant that is located right around the corner, adjacent to the Westin, Toronto Prince hotel. Upon arrival and check into my hotel, I was given a $20 gift certificate to a dinner at either the Japanese, Chinese, or Persian restaurant that they have there. I Katsura-the Japanese cuisine. On the second night. I decided I would go there to redeem my coupon. It was fairly busy but I did not need a reservation, I walked right in. It's took over 10 minutes for anyone to come up to me. I ordered a water, pretty simple. That took about five minutes to get to me. Again, I only saw one woman working there and she had about eight tables. I ordered a miso soup and a seaweed salad. That took a while to get to me. Once the soup came to me, I asked for a spoon and it never came. Maybe it's custom to drink out of the bowl, but that's what I ended up doing anyway. There is Wi-Fi there, thank goodness because my main objective was to get two hours of work done while enjoying Japanese food. The Japanese food is pricey for the quality of it. It's probably the worst quality of Japanese food I've ever had. I then ordered an eight piece sushi sampler so that I could taste the variety of everything. The portions were big for one person as I think it's designed for sharing. I only ate half. And it wasn't great. I had two coupons and they only accepted one. The $20 gift certificate they accepted. But, the five dollar gift certificate that I had from not having my cleaning service come, did not work there. It took a while for me to get my check, again. Also, I trying to figure out what I was going to give her fir a tip by using my currency calculator, and she stood over me with the credit card machine as I was trying to figure it out. I asked for more time and I don't think she understood. Overall, between the service and the quality of the food I would skip this one. Even with a $20 gift certificate."}
{"text":"Amongst a sea of Japanese restaurants in GTA, this place stands out by offering authentic Japanese fine dining, pure and clean Japanese food, none of the fusion/innovative rolls that you'd find in so called sushi restaurants in trendy neighbourhoods.  

Quality and freshness of sashimi is high.  Meticulous presentation, reminds me of the more traditional restaurants in Japan.  Prices are higher here than the Korean and Chinese operated sushi restaurants 
that dominate the GTA scene now, but that's like comparing apples to oranges so I withdraw my price comparison point."}
{"text":"Hmm disappointed with the way the place is maintained. Run down, old staff no excitement, avg quality food, specially the bento box. The Tepanyaki is still good but the experience is very sad. There is hardly anyone at the restaurant, it seems they are running it for the heck of it.
Visit Oshio if you want good Japanese bento box and tempura!"}
{"text":"Fresh, best sashami I've had in a long time, and just a unique and different take on japanese food, more traditional, more attention to detail, in both presentation and taste. 
I came here tonight with my parents because of Andrew A's review. I forgot about this place, but I used to come here a lot with I was kid, before the place became so pricey. 

It was like being in familiar territory because the same people that were working here when i was a kid, still worked here except not in their usual kimono garb. The service is really attentive, at one point we had three people serving us, even the chef came out to say hello!

The food was very good, but very pricey! We had a sashami platter, and you can definately taste the difference between regular fish, and katsura fish (however, if you go to vancouver, it does taste this fresh with a third of the cost).

One thing that was very worth it was the grilled unagi rice. They make it in front of you, with the rice, wasabi, nori, eel (which he torch seared the top first0, egg, and some rice balls, mixed it up all together, and it served at like 7-8 bowls full. ($33)
We also got the black cod, which was very nice, smooth and crunchy. it same with small side garnishes, including a sticky rice mochi wrapped in a bamboo leaf, some pickled veggies, all edible. 
What I loved was the attention to detail, and how delicate everything was. 

For dessert we got the banana crepe ($8) which was flambeed with grand marnier and served with bananas on the side, and strawberries. 

The total cost was $180 for 3 ppl. It was quite worth it, but only for a special occasion. Something unique fo sure. I wonder if it's comparable to the new Katseki place that opened at the japanese community centre."}

I have always enjoyed a meal with family or friends here.

Comfortable, welcoming, friendly service

{"text":"I went here while staying at the Westin on business.  The service was pretty good but the prices were outrageous: $15 for a hand roll!?! Moreover $45 for the chef's choice sushi dinner for only 12 pc was steep - especially when they charge extra for the miso soup. If the fish was fresh, I might have felt a little better about the prices.

I left $100 poorer and still hungry - won't be going back on my next trip! I can see why there were only 3 other people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with my surrogate grandparents and aunt tonight (Saturday). Our reservation was for six. Initially, I thought to myself that it was quite empty. At one point I was even  freaking out (only in my head of course) as the only reason a restaurant would be empty on a Saturday night is because it sucks. A mere thirty minutes later, the restaurant was practically a full house.

According to my aunt, Japanese people drink beer before their dinner and wine during their meal. I had to oblige... you don't want to disappoint the ancestors. I started with a draft beer - Asahi. The appetizer was skipped and we went right to our meals. My drink for this round was a Spritz.  I ordered the Katsura Special Moriawase. It was goooood! You get tempura (including shrimp), chicken teriyaki sticks (2) and steak with grilled vegetables and rice.

For dessert, I ordered the Anmitsu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anmitsu). I love Anmitsu and have had dismal versions of it throughout the years. This place is right on with it though. Full of kanten, mandarin slices, strawberry, and azuki paste, it was the perfect end to my meal.

I'll be back as I would love have their teppanyaki."}
{"text":"The place serves good food, excellent Sashimi... The tepanyaki table was ok. The chefs needs a but more training to deliver much more fun during the cooking, which that's all about this type of service. On the other hand, all chefs are kind and always smiling, that's a good vibe for the food"}
{"text":"Walking in I was underwhelmed by the atmosphere. Our party of 2 sat in the furthest corner and we ordered off the regular menu. 
I ordered the Boston Crab which is deep fried as an appie and the sushi/sashimi sampler for entree which is 13 pieces of food. 
The Boston crab when it arrived scared the shit out of me. It was literally crab with the shell on and everything deep fried served in a box. SHELL ON! As you can see from the pic it looks like something out of Fear Factor. I couldn't do it but the other person with me choked it down. 
When the sampler arrived it had  mainly very small pieces of fish. I heard the table behind us ask the manager about the quality of the shrimp and she thought it tasted \"off\". He assured her it was fine however looking at my own shrimp on my plate I wasn't sure if I should take the leap. I did and it tasted ok I guess but it's only been an hour so we'll see what havoc the toilet will experience if it was in fact \"off\". 
The food is insanely expensive and for the amount and overall quality I was disappointed. 
Service was nice. All the girls were very nice and attentive. 
Overall...a low meh for me. Won't be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"I have been going to Katsura for over 25+ years now! It is Japanese dining at it's finest located inside/adjacent to the Westin Prince Hotel.  I have ordered almost everything on their menu since I've first started going there. I have never made a complaint about the food, nor ever had one. Service tends to not be the greatest when it's busy, but it's a fantastic restaurant. A little pricey....yes, but the quality is top notch for sushi & steak terriyaki (filet mignon). Most Japanese & AYCE restaurants make terriyaki using very poor quality steak that has leather like consistency. Katsura's meat just melts in your mouth!

Some of my fav's that i've ordered:

Chicken terriyaki - moist, delicious terriyaki glaze that is not overly sweet.
Lunch specials - they have a couple of different combo plates with tempura & terriyaki or terriyaki & sushi. One of my fav items to order because you get a taste of more than 1 menu item. (try the mixed plate
Sushi - probably some of the best quality sushi i have ever tried! The quality & taste is something i've never experienced at any other Japanese restaurant in Toronto yet.
Teppanyaki table -  what's not to love! Generous portions of meat & vegetables cooked at your table with a little bit of entertainment.
Tatami rooms - we did a set course meal and had the unforgettable experience of the Tatami room! 

Is it expensive - YES, is it worth it HELL YEAH! Splurge & enjoy. We go back for birthday's, anniversaries, special occasions etc. a couple of times a year. It's not a place i will go every month, but it is great for a special night out because I know the food & quality is consistently great!"}
{"text":"Stay away. Food is fine if it were a quarter the cost. Nothing remarkable in any way."}
{"text":"BUT THERE'S MEAT IN MY VEGGIE NOODLES??!

We love sushi, so we thought we would try out this place again because our first experience wasn't the best- we blamed it on them being a new business but three years later and myyy goodness. 
All you can eat is pricy but what they don't tell you is that it is actually all you can taste but that wasn't even the issue. 
I ordered our first set of dishes, my veggie noodles came with a piece of minced mystery meat on top. I let it slide, then we ordered our second round, 20 minutes later nothing. Finally a waiter came and said they had trouble with the ordering machine. We said okay no problem, THEN another 15 minutes later we get our cucumber maki roll and the plate was DIRTY, oily, had fish pieces and mystery crumbs. 
I called the manager over, he said he could do a 20% discount and AND that we should expect things to not be perfect because they were very busy. This was basically the back and forth of the conversation -he also told me that the mystery meat was probably beef and I shouldn't worry - hello I am a vegetarian man!

I finally told him I would not be paying for the 6 pieces of sushi I ate because that was not worth 28.00 he took his time to argue with me... 

GUYS it is just not worth it.. I'm sorrry but this place seems so nice from the pictures
they are not sanitary and have low standards if they don't even expect you to have a clean plate to eat from. 

Don't go -and don't worry - I've notified the health inspectors from Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Black cod appetizer I had as a closer to my Omakase.  Sashimi was delicious. Sat at the sushi bar, nice unfiltered saki and chit chatted with the chef. Everything was sublime. Coming back Monday for a tasting dinner."}
{"text":"We recently went for teppanyaki dinner here in a group.  It was quite warm, dim and cramped in the restaurant.  They seated us in a very tight area where it was next to impossible to get in & out of your seat if you sat in front/centre of the cooking table.  Basically, you had to either climb over your friends or ask them to stand up and shuffle out so you could get out.  It was very tight seating for large people. 

The hostess ladies and staff were very friendly and nice.  The chef was a bit quiet.  He was very nice and professional and tried his best to crack a little joke here and there but it was no \"show\" like Benihana or anywhere else we've been for Teppanyaki.  

The food was okay; the steak was very tender but a bit bland.  The veggies were okay - it was a mix of zucchini, onion and mushrooms.  The rice was plain steamed rice... I was really looking forward to fried rice but was not given the option.  Overall, it was enjoyable but not as entertaining or tasty as I had hoped.  Side note - parking is free on site - just let the hostess know your license plate."}
{"text":"An authentic Japanese restaurant. Very rare in the GTA. It is staffed by Japanese. A large variety of dishes can be had at the Teppanyaki grill. Three types of beef. Sushi grade fish. Lobster, crab and shrimp. I personally favour the scallops. Which are delicious. 
There is the Teppanyaki menu (cooking table) and a sit down table menu."}
{"text":"Time warp experience, same place as 20 years ago. Not great.

Katsura at The Prince was once a very prestigious and authentic Japanese Restaurant. Some Japanese customers of mine always wanted to go to this place for any special events. That was 20+ years ago. And the main reasons for giving them 3 stars as opposed to 2 is that they make an attempt at being a traditional Japanese restaurant as opposed to a modern, iPad ordering, AYCE Japanese place.

The interior has not changed at all in 20 years. Lunch is a bad experience with a dark interior, an Asian man in an ill-fitting suit who pours the soy sauce for you and says \"watch out for the wasabi\", and an Asian woman with a geisha outfit that doesn't know the first thing about poise, etiquette and gracefulness.

The sushi is expensive and \"so-so\", lacking any presentation beauty or real freshness. I had the Sushi and Sashimi platter and at $38, I thought it lacked some creativity. I believe you may be better off with the teriyaki steak and chicken.

Dinner with a large group may be a better experience and while I did that several times 10 years ago, I wouldn't think of going there for a large group dinner today. I believe they rely mainly on the hotel guests and business conferences.

Of course a fresh coat of paint, some menu changes and a bit of modernization could do wonders for this place, as there aren't very many other good Japanese \"traditional\" restaurants in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"Truly an authentic Japanese restaurant owned by Japanese people.  I went on two different occasions (Aoi menu once and Sunday special menu the next time) and can sum up the quality of food I had for both times: 

1. Nishikimori-salad
The first time I had it with the Aoi menu, there was a lack of dressing and the wasabi taste of the dressing was quite over-bearing.  However, the second time I had it, it was absolutely delicious.  The wasabi taste was no longer over-bearing and the dressing had a well-balanced vinaigrette-y taste to it.  

2. Kakitama soup
The soup itself is a Japanese version of an \"egg-drop soup\".  The appearance of the soup is great but the taste was a bit of a let-down.  It was quite bland but I feel like the biggest contributing factor to that was the lack of richness to the broth itself.  

3. Brochette (Aoi menu) 
This consisted of a shrimp, salmon, and scallop skewer.  Everything there was delicious and they cook your brochette in garlic butter so you couldn't go wrong there.  It was a tad bit too salty though.  

4. Lobster Tail & Prime Filet of Beef (Aoi menu) 
The lobster tail was delicious - absolutely delicious.  The prime filet of beef was good, high quality beef.  It is important to get it medium rare because if it were cooked more than that on a teppanyaki table, it would be way over-cooked.  

5. Teppan Combination (Sunday special)
This consists of a platter of prime beef, scallops, and chicken.  The scallops were absolutely heavenly.  I am not usually a fan of scallops and I wanted more after I had my two that day.  The chicken was okay but lacked a lot of flavour.  I really needed the ginger soy sauce to spice my flavour up.  The beef, although I had asked for medium rare, was too overcooked that day (to medium) and therefore, ruined the experience a bit for me. 

Each teppanyaki combination comes with a pleasant array of stir-fried vegetables (consisting of mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and bean sprouts) and a bowl of white rice.  

6. Banana flambé/Sawakaya berries (Aoi menu) or Green tea ice cream (Sunday special)
I had the flambe that day and it was absolutely delicious.  Perhaps the best thing on that menu.  It is definitely a MUST TRY! 

All in all, portion wise, I have never really been able to ever finish my meal.  It is a lot of food.  

Service was excellent and the teppanyaki chefs will try to do a couple of tricks for you including the pepper shake trick and the onion volcano.  They are all polite and professional.  Also, on my birthday, they presented me with an absolutely delicious blackberry pastry.  

The place is very clean and nice & quiet.  Service deserves 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3.5 stars and that leaves us with an overall score of 4/5.  All in all, it is a must-try, truly authentic Japanese teppanyaki place."}
{"text":"When on a business trip to Toronto for work a co-worker took a couple people to Kasura for dinner.  It's your typical Japanese teppanyaki and sushi place.  The atmosphere was nice but the restaurant was pretty dead on the Monday night we were there.  Teppanyaki places without the energy of a crowd are pretty blah.

Our chef was a bit distant and not very engaging compared to similar restaurants I've been to.  He did a little banging with salt and pepper mills and started an onion on fire but other than that it wasn't very impressive and the preparation of the food was bland.  They charge extra for the salad where other places offer it as part of your meal.  I also missed that we didn't get our rice fried and it was a bit bland in conjunction with the steak i got.  The beef was good and cooked liked I aske.  The dipping sauces were good but not remarkable.

Overall I'd say it's average and expensive for what you get - maybe it would have been more fun with a full restaurant, a big group and a more exciting chef.  

If you are staying in the adjacent Westin it wouldn't be a bad choice but don't expect too much and if you are alone I'd sit away from the grill and enjoy a quiet table with sushi."}
{"text":"We were here for dinner & got to try their Family Special Menu (Sundays only).

I had the Suyatem Plate ($28), which came w/ assorted nigiri sushi (few pieces of raw sushi, 2 rolls), assorted tempera (shrimp, zucchini, yam), chicken yakitori. All the specials came with salad, miso soup, rice & green tea ice cream. It was so filling ! I didn't find it particularly that out of this world amazing. It was nice, fresh but you can have this at other restaurants as well. 

The Sunday specials were great! I don't think I would like it here on a regular day though. Stepping in, you can tell it's one of those pretentious places w/ nice decor & ambiance which simply means... we look authentic & can jack up prices & even more so since it's part of the Westin Prince Hotel. 

They are having summerlicious at Katsura and those interested in the summerlicious menu sit in the teppanyaki area only. 

Service was good. The waitresses wore kimonos and they were all very courteous. 

Parking - ample & free! Make sure to give them your license plate number though. 

Restaurant - Katsura is located to the right of the parking lot. You do not have to go inside the hotel first to access it. You could... but it would be a long walk :)"}
{"text":"Best unagi I've we've had! Big portions here. The eel was blow torched and mixed together at the table, and came in a huuuuuge bowl that instantly made me second guess the portion sizes. Luckily the bowl wasn't filled up to the very top.

This place is definitely one of the priciest Japanese restaurants I've ever been to, perhaps it's because its in a hotel? The unagi dish was $38, and though it was absolutely delicious, the price is a tad expensive. 

My partner ordered the nigiri and sashimi plate which was also $38. I wouldn't splurge on sushi here, as the same amount of nigiri/sashimi elsewhere would be less than half the price. The dish was okay, but the only memorable aspect was the price."}
{"text":"My family usually goes to this place for birthday dinners or other small special occasions. Located in the Prince Hotel this place offers great food and a great show.
The restaurant is separated into two parts; a dinner area and a teppanyaki area. I have only been to the latter. The food is priced at more upscale prices, but their food is extremely good.
When you order a teppanyaki meal, you get soup, salad, the meal, and desert. I can't say enough about how delicious the salad dressing is. It is a ginger type of dressing, but no other dressing has come close to this one in any other Japanese restaurant I've been to.
When the chef comes out to make the dinner, he uses his cooking tools to keep your attention. The chef doesn't throw around knives, they are specialists in tossing around the salt and pepper shakers. Its a small treat while watching the chef cook your food.
The main course itself is very tasty, nothing unique or anything, but a nice blend of butter, salt, and soya sauce.
The desert is also very good. For desert I've always had the banana crepe, which is exactly what the name says with some rum and tropical juice mixture. This desert is very good (pretty sweet too), and you also get a small flame show for preparation.
Katsura will continue to be a place where I will frequent on special occasions."}
{"text":"First time here for their Winterlicious 2016 dinner. Katsura is not inside the Weston Prince hotel but next to it and is accessible through the hotel. Parking is free if you give the host your license plate number. Since the Winterlicious menu features teppanyaki, we sat where the grill was. Not overly comfortable seating and for a group of 7 people, it was slightly cramped but it's no big deal. The chef we got was friendly and personable. Our chef made a little fire mountain with some sliced up onions and he did cool tricks with the salt and pepper grinder. So you got a mini show with your dinner. 

The only downer to the whole experience was the wait staff. Waiting service was mediocre for most of the dinner (other than the teppanyaki chef, he was awesome) but it went down hill real fast when it came to the bill.  Our waitress was not rude but she never smiled and looked mildly annoyed that I needed to pay by credit card. She got the machine, asked me how much to input then just walked away and left me there. She was gone for quite a bit of time and my friend  also needed to use the machine to pay for her bill. Came back after a long time, my friend paid and then another friend explained that the rest of the bill was in cash and she just took the money and left. No thank you, nothing. I hope the chef got my tip because our waitress definitely didn't deserve it. Felt like I was at a Congee Wong. 
Appetizer: Kakitama chicken broth 
Main course: selected black Angus sirloin and black tiger shrimps
Dessert: pear sorbet

The chicken broth was a bit of a disappointment. The picture I took off my broth was before I mixed it. If you give it a mix, it has swirls of egg white in it. It was bland and left much to be desired. I can't imagine the miso soup or salad being any better. Actually feels a bit like a rip off since a small soup or salad is usually complimentary at fancier a la carte Japanese restaurants. I guess I overestimated the appetizers. 



Moving on to the main course, vegetables weren't bad. Chef was on point with the cooking of the sirloin. Asked for medium rare, and it was cooked exactly to my liking. Main course was pretty good. Sirloin was tender and juicy. Shrimps were alright. Vegetables, rice, and cooked bean sprouts came were part of the meal. The portions are small (expected) but I didn't leave hungry. 

Pear sorbet was refreshing. Good amount of pear flavour and not overly sweet. 

Suggestions for the business would be to have better lighting outside their restaurant. It was so dark and the door was kind of in a corner; some of my friends and I had trouble looking for the front door. Also when you're more of an upscale  restaurant, food presentation is part of it all."}
{"text":"With winterlucious upon us, I took advantage of trying out some restaurants I would never randomly walk into.  Today's target was Katsura found within the Westin Prince compound.  You do not need to pay for parking, just tell the hostess your license plate number ans they take care of the rest. 
The restaurant is very big with both a sit down dining area/ and a cooking table section along with the traditional Japanese private sitting rooms.
The lunch menu was quite nice and all selections were well described.  Ordered the miso soup to start which was very flavourful (much better than the ayce sushi restaurants), for the main was the black cod which again was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Moist and with a nice crust.  Of the three desserts I recommend the pear sorbet (made in house) or the agar agar selection which had a nice creamy azuki bean paste accompanied with a mandarin wedge and light syrup.  Service was nice and never rushed.  Looking forward to try out their regular menu on Sundays as they have some interesting set meals."}
{"text":"Katsura is an authentic Japanese restaurant with very classy decor, situated by the Westin Prince hotel which is a nice property.

Unfortunately, they are a little pricey, the service is good but not outstanding and the food is ok compared to other Japanese fjne dining.

The teppanyaki cook was competent.  There are no really tricks or entertainment so don't go expecting that.  Meal portion were sufficient.  I really liked the atmosphere and Asian theme of the furnishings.  This restaurant was not very busy for a Friday night dinner, I suspect it is because of the many other food options close by at lower prices."}
{"text":"Thought i would chime in here, just to give the audience some more depth on Katsura and its history and what makes it so special. 
Not to berate Victor at all, and I think you had the wrong expectations when coming to Katsura, it is not a Benihana type of restaurant where you expect a show. I would suggest Memories of Japan if you are in the north york/don mills area if you wanted a show.

Katsura was started by the original owners of the Prince Hotel (who are japanese) and it was the first sushi restaurant to open in Toronto. The differences between katsura and most other establishments in Toronto are namely that Katsura's sushi chefs are Japanese, real Japanese chefs. They are licensed in Japan, not to say that the Korean Chefs who were licensed in Korea arent great, but there is something to be said about the authenticity of Japanese Sushi chefs making Japanese food. I have also tried the teppanyaki here, and although i find it baffling that anybody would choose teppanyaki table over sitting at the sushi bar, that is my own opinion. Katsura offers some of the freshest sushi available on the east coast of north america. It is not modern japanese cuisine (no dragon rolls), it is really just straightup sushi and sashimi prepared by old school guys who have been tending on me since infancy. If you are looking for a real authentiic sushi restaurant with great sushi fish, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I went for its summerlicious menu. It was a little disappointed. Tiger shrimp was salty and steak was just ok. Dessert was terrible which hardly to finish. My friend was thinking to go somewhere else to eat again after dinner because he didn't feel the food is good as he expected."}
{"text":"So much emphasis was placed on this wagyu beef:
Wagyu Premium ????????? 64
grilled selected AAAA, 
Marble Level 9, 
super premium Wagyu (5 oz.)
I couldn't help but be excited over this 3 course summerlicious meal ($48 + tax).
I went on Saturday night at 7pm and was surprised by a near empty restaurant.  After settling down, a lady in kimono came to take my order.
Appertizer - Kakitama Chicken Broth
Similar to Egg drop soup.  Pleasantly light and flavourful.
Main - Premium Wagyu Striploin 5 oz.
Teppanyaki style cooking.  The beef shrank even smaller lol.  It came with mixed vegetables, bean sprouts and a bowl of rice.  There was a special soy sauce and a special kind of mustard for dipping.  The beef was juicy at medium heat, and it was tender, but not melting in your mouth kind of tender like  the way people describe wagyu beef.
Dessert - Traditional Anmitsu
Essentially clear jelly with 2 pieces of fruits and a table spoon of red bean paste.  The presentation was disappointing as it could have been more creatively put together.  
Although the meal tasted good, i left wishing there were more food.... at least complementary tea as an appreciative gesture."}
{"text":"The Tempura is really fantastic...I had the shrimp and it was very good. I also tried some nigiri and sashimi. It was good. The chef is actually Japanese and has been doing this for 30 years. I will say that while the preparation was very good, everything made fresh, the fish quality wasn't the best I've had. It was good, but not great.  To sum up, great tempura, good sushi. Not sure why all the bad reviews. My experience was positive overall and I'd come back in a hot minute for the tempura."}
