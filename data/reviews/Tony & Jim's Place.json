{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER!!!!! Been listening to ppl go on for years how awesome the wings are here, as well as the other food, but just never went out of my way to try it. Sucks to be me! I also tried the pizza as well- yum!  The staff were very friendly& appreciative to the customers.  I will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"I ordered 2lbs of Wings and a Chicken Parm sandwich. The wings are REALLY good, big, crispy, great flavour. Awesome. I ordered Medium flavour and it was a great \"temperature\" to get as I could taste something besides pure \"heat.\" That said, next time I will order a hotter temperature or maybe the honey garlic.  The Chicken Parm tasted sooo good! Fresh bun, thick chicken breast (?) slices, loads of cheese and a good sauce. I will ask for extra sauce to dip in next time as it was tasty. I've never had a chicken parm before but was glad I ordered, a new \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"Tried these guys out using SkipTheDishes.com and loved it! Over $20 and delivery is free and the wings were amazing. I also tried the chicken parm sandwich which was great too but next time I'll ask for extra sauce on it. Can't wait to try them again :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can go back here. That had to be the worst veal sandwich ever. And that back room is dingy and dark.  The friend that I went with couldn't even finish his.  And the thing was that they said it was popular menu item.  I'd hate to see the least popular."}
{"text":"Be going to them for years. Far as I'm concern ... Best pizza in Brampton. U won't be dissapointed !!"}
{"text":"This place never ever fails to please! Awesome amazing food, great service & delivery is always quick. I always get the veal sandwich sweet with mushrooms & mild wings, this is my \"go to\" for Tony & Jim's"}
{"text":"Customer service is NOT their thing.  I had ordered dinner to be delivered I was sooo hungry (pizza, salad, drinks, pasta, and wings) I waited almost an hour and a half and when it came they told me cash only. WTF shouldnt someone have said that over the phone the delivery guy was so rude and tried to make it seem like it was my fault.  Anyways. Dominoes came to save the day."}
{"text":"Veal sandwich! Big and very tasty. (NH) I usually get it with mushrooms and cheese. I can never finish the whole thing. I normally finish half and save the other half for later on. Mmmmm. The best in Brampton?"}
{"text":"Good ol fashion greasy, italian pizza! The pizza is pretty basic, can get pricey as you add toppings. Their wings are HUGE however last time we ordered them they smelt rotten, they tasted good but smelt like they were waaay past due.   If you're really craving something delicious; give their sandwiches a try. I strongly recommend their chicken parm or chicken caesar.    Staff is friendly bunch of guys with not a lot to say but customer service is alright."}
{"text":"I would give -1 stars if I could. The food was disgusting, and the owner is disgusting.  \"Brampton's best wings\" were over cooked trash.  Chicken Cesar salad was leaves and mayonnaise with more over cooked trash.  Pizza could almost maybe have been good, but we ordered hot peppers as a topping. Rather than normal banana peppers like every other pizza place, it was carpeted with jalapeños, and inedible.  Only good thing was the rice ball, which said it only contained cheese, but also had some meat floating around in there. I don't know too many vegetarians that'd be happy about that.  Oh yeah, and we we called to ask about what happened to our order, the owner got irate, screamed and hung up.  Don't waste your money, your time, or your breath on this place or this owner. You're better off ordering your pizza and wings from the frozen section at the grocery store. That's probably where the rice ball came from anyway."}
{"text":"Their wings are the best. If you're looking for suicide wings in Brampton, this is the place to go. Takeout place."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak/veal sandwiches! Staff is friendly and talkative in the shop front, too. They were super busy when I went (a Friday night), definitely order ahead! I had a veal sandwich here years ago, with someone I'd like to forget, but unfortunately I forgot the place instead of the guy who bought me the sandwich LOL!  Very glad I refound this place.   I wish I had a sandwich right now... extra hot peppers please!"}
{"text":"The wings were truly amazing. However only giving 3 stars because their pizza was just...okay."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused with some of these reviews.  My workplace is 2 minutes away and we order ALOT of stuff from these guys. (COB). We love all the food. The sandwiches are off the hook. The pizza is amazing. It's not greasy - it's got flavour and it's always cooked perfecto.... What excellent is the staff will suggest things or explain to you the difference with their hot and sweet is. Others places don't.  It's a nice family owned business that has been there for years because it's amazing. Hands down. Good wings good pizza and amazing sandwiches.   They do close early (family owned so I understand) so order early"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a sucker for a good veal sang-wheech! These guys got this sh!t down. Some of you maybe asking why? well here ya go...  The veal is super tender, serious, most tender veal ever.  The peppers taste good rather then killing your mouth with just heat. The bun is fresh, and big. The guys are friendly and fast. and finally unlike other Italin sandwhich places...it is not greasy!"}
{"text":"Tony and Jim's is famous for their huge wings and chicken parmesan sandwich. Both of those, however, aren't my personal favorites. Instead, I like their panzerotti the best as well as their lasagna. Can't go wrong at Tony and Jim's!"}
{"text":"Okay sent my mom in to pick up my chicken parm today!! And all I can say is BOMB DOT COM!! . Todays Chicken Parm was amazing and the reason I started going here. I hope it is always consistent because if it is, HAND DOWN THEY HAVE BEST SANDWICHS!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian sandwiches in the city, been going here for literally about 20 years now..  It's all about the chicken parm IMO but they sure sell alot of veals and steaks too.  Wings are great and very large however make sure if you're getting takeout you don't let them steam up in the styrofoam box, or they lose the crispyness.  Get a chicken parm sandwich with cheese & hot peppers and you definitely won't be disappointed!  I like the chicken parm. dinner w/spaghetti too.  Avoid their slices of pizza because they;re often stale, but whole pizzas are nice"}
{"text":"Best wings in town... Suicide is the hottest I have ever had in Brampton!!"}
{"text":"Honestly love the people that work here, they're on top of their game, food is great and know how to run a business. They lost a star because they don't do delivery as far as I know, not sure if it has changed, if it has then I would add a star. The pizza here isn't as good as I wish it would be but it's not terrible, although I'd rather go to city pizza or popular pizza for local pizzas. I've highly recommended this place for their veal sandwiches. I get one every month or so. So good."}
{"text":"Great service great food, the sandwiches are great the pizza is excellent you must try this gem of Brampton"}
{"text":"Great food, so-so service but let's face it, it's about the FOOD.  The best pizza in Brampton but everything they make is great. Sandwiches, Chicken Wings.  Get your order to go as the place is a bit dumpy looking (but again, it's about the food)."}

{"text":"Best panzerotti I've ever had- definitely get the deep fried one with extra tomato sauce on the side- go big or go home lol It's also huge, so easy to split with someone or save half for later. Pizza is so so, I prefer Pizzaville. Haven't yet tried the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Place is best for Takeout not sit in.  Had their steak sandwich and it was good but I go there for the Wings. Best wings ive had anywhere. Wings are huge and under $15 for 2 pounds unlike some places where it's $20 plus. Suicide wings have some serious kick!!  If you go there get the wings!!!"}
