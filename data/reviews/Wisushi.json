{"text":"Decided to try this place out last night.  .... sooo glad we did. It's cute & quaint, food was fresh & service was good.  We had the seafood Oudon soup to start (we shared it as it was large) which was amazing ....highly recommend it! Seafood terriaki was also amazing & the sushi, sashimi & rolls were extremely good."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I've ever had.  I've been going by it for years but didn't bother entering because of its hole-in-the-wall exterior, but a colleague (who has spent many years in Japan) strongly recommended it saying he never lets a trip to the West Island go by without dining there.  It's very neat, the staff is extremely friendly. A great spot for a little dinner among friends or a casual night for two.  The sushi is absolutely excellent. On the small side, but bursting with flavour. Melts in your mouth and blends together marvellously.  A must."}
{"text":"Some of my favourite sushi! The decor is cheesy and they play a lot of Elvis but the food is consistently tasty and the price is right. The only thing to watch out for is that when you order a combo or anything that is \"chef's choice\" you might end up with something you're not used to, instead of the standard California, Kamikaze, and salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Unfortunately - and not because I did not try (went 3 times) I did not like the food/portions. Very expensive for what you get!  For lunch, paid $20 and was still super hungry... And I eat sushi twice a week. I went three times, just because I read the reviews and really wanted to give this place a chance. And I also work nearby... Too bad :("}
{"text":"The sushi is great but the service is slow.  I have been going here for years and the sushi is always so good! It is always really fresh tasting and delicious. They have some great specialty rolls as well. It is pretty pricey, but honestly, you get what you pay for!  This past weekend, I placed my order about an hour in advance for takeout. When I got there, it wasn't ready and we ended up waiting over a half hour longer for the food. The staff were not overly friendly, although they were not unfriendly, just very monotone and curt.   Once we got home and had our first taste of the sushi, all the time we waited was forgotten as it was just so good. No matter what you order, make sure to get some spicy mayo on the side as it is very unique and delicious, it does not taste like the spicy mayo that I have had anywhere else. The dressing on their house salad is also amazing, so definitely try one of those!  The sushi and sashimi is just all so good! The only issue I have with the maki rolls are that most of them are cut in four, making each piece quite the mouthful. This is solved by asking them to cut it into 5 or 6 pieces instead.  The sashimi I had (just salmon, since nobody else was eating sashimi) was amazing. So fresh it practically melted in my mouth! And the Maki rolls... yum. They have a bunch of specialty rolls unique to wisushi which are awesome, as are any of the ones on their menu. I highly recommend the Gucci (lobster, tuna, and salmon, with lettuce and tempura in rice paper), which is pricey yet well worth the splurge, and the Rainbow 2000 (tuna toro on the inside; salmon, tuna, and avocado on the outside) because it tastes wonderful. There are a couple of vegetarian rolls which are also good, particularly the sweet potato one.  One word of warning before coming here, the parking lot is a disaster! Being beside the SAQ express and a couple other restaurants, it is always jam-packed and hard to find parking."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going there for years and I try to visit it every time I am back in Montreal. They are a small location - be prepared to get acquainted with your neighbouring dining mates - but I see they've expanded in the last little while, so that's great. Fish is fresh (fantastic sashimi) and they have unique takes on maki. They have an excellent spicy scallop nigiri. Their salad dressing is to die for... I wish they would bottle it already (though Wafu is a comparable option). It definitely isn't cheap (even their lunch specials are on the pricier side) but I am willing to pay more for high quality sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in ages. Great spot."}
