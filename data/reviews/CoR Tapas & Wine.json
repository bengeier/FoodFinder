{"text":"Great place! Intimate, upbeat, and low key just the place Phoenix needed! Defiantly a place to be experienced the staff is great food is distinct one of my better evenings."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a friend of mine. We both loved it! We shared the Pork (quite tender) and the Spicy Scallops...the Scallops was our favorite! The spicy with the sweet is a fantastic blend!  We ended our evening with a delicious dessert Tripple Delight. VERY flavorful!  Our server was Mondonna (sp?) and she was VERY attentive and well versed in the menu. She gave us suggestions based on our tastes. In addition, the owners were on hand to greet us at the door. They made it a point to talk to each of their guests and made you feel like you were a VIP.   For those who are new to the Tapas concept please understand that Tapas are small plates with the highest quality of food and flavor. Don't expect to stuff yourself.   I will be back soon and can't wait to try more fantastic plates."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this new neighborhood gem after a suggestion from my friends and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Great wine selection friendly staff and delicious tapas. Alan is amazing and extremely friendly and attentive.  I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"CoR Tapas is a wonderful place to eat. The co-owner Ray makes you feel at home is a so funny to chat with. The food is amazing hats off to the chief's. The sangria is the bomb you have to try them. Please stop and say hi."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night, and there was only one other party in the restaurant but they must have all driven, because there was nowhere in the small parking lot to park. We eventually found parking and upon entering the restaurant were informed that happy hour only applied to the bar, but the tables in the regular restaurant area were literally a few feet from the bar stools. We wanted happy hour, so we sat at the bar next to other people, but would have preferred one of the many empty booths/tables feet away. The wine was good (I had the Cabernet on special), but the food was less than desirable. I'm a big tapas fan and it just wasn't up to par -- and the prices were a little high. We had the hummus (don't recommend), the lamb, and I honestly don't even remember what else, but we ordered about five things and none of them were particularly delicious. The bartender was friendly enough but toward the end of our time there things got weird. Either the owner or the chef -- couldn't tell which he was -- kept coming out of the back to literally stand against the wall and stare at us. It was bizarre. He looked irritated but just kept staring at us and the few other folks in the restaurant. Right before we left, he started arguing with the server and she apologized, which was also strange -- we heard their entire conversation since they were standing right by us. Won't be back, which is too bad because we live right down the street and were excited to try this place! Sad day."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed in this place! We live right up the street and drove by several times and finally decided to go in for happy hour on a Friday night. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and we had to park in their overflow parking which wasn't a problem but they didn't have any signs out so I only knew they had extra parking from looking online beforehand. The atmosphere is great. It was pretty slow for a Friday evening- only bar seats were taken and the rest of the place was empty. $5 sangria and select wines for happy hour was great, but the happy hour tapas were NOT $5 as advertised. There was maybe one that was $5. But we ordered 3 different dishes. We got upsold on the lamb because the $9 lamb tapa only has one piece but the $17 meal has 3 pieces. So we got the meal to share, which was not a meal portion, just a meal price. The calamari had maybe 3/4 of a cup serving portion, and the meatballs we ordered hadn't come after 2 rounds of drinks and about an hour and a half, so we had them taken off our tab. So two rounds of drinks (for two people) and two tapas to share came out to a $55 happy hour tab! Yikes. I mean, we knew it wouldn't be cheap because of the lamb but not really a good happy hour, plus we never even received part of our order. We went to Postino's afterward for actual dinner and our bill was LESS for 2 rounds of drinks and two actual full meals. This place just seems like an investment gone wrong with poor management/ownership. We won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our visit to CoR! The fresh spinach salad with roasted vegetables and balsamic was delicious!  The presentation of the food is spot on, just beautiful. We tried several tapas to include a bruchetta board, caprese, spicy scallops, a portobello tapa and a dessert trio. We were not disappointed! Not only is the food artistic, but the whole bistro is. The atmosphere is very cool and trendy. The bar is gorgeous, polished concrete and very cool barstools. The bartenders are very enjoyable to interact with and make the garnish on the drinks extra special.This is not your average restaurant, it is a very unique bistro. I loved the fresh flowers and votives too. It is a fun experience every time we go! This is our new \"go-to\" date night place."}
{"text":"Worst meal of my life! $100 disappointment. The food looks nothing like the photos on yelp. They came back three times to tell us they were out of the lamb, the jalapeno sauce for the scallops, and shishito peppers. The meatballs were dry inside, the brussel sprout salad looks nothing like the photos they were big chunks and not fully cooked, the scallops tiny with no cripsy seared outside and no sauce. When the patata bravas showed up i asked if they had changed something as I saw a whipped up potato photo online. They asked the chef he said he had no idea what we were talking about. A man (i think the manager) came over and asked where we saw the photo (on yelp) then said \"oh well we changed the menu, this is the new one\" I'm thinking a new menu where you don't even have half the items we tried to order! The menu is small how can you not have your ingredients when you open at 4:30 which is the time we were there! I left hungry as I barely ate and now feel ill so does my boyfriend who never gets sick from food!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food, great atmosphere, and the kindest staff who went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"Is give this place 0 stars if I could.  Invent here with my buddy after work and the food is boring as hell.  Good beer selection but damn... Enough with ripping off people with small expensive plate nonsense.  His place is also odd and the middle of the ghetto. Weird."}
{"text":"Ok, if you enjoy just a wine bar for the wine then this place is great, but if you with to really taste European dishes (incredible) mixed with some Spanish flare and sangria then damn, it's as good as this run on sentence!   Ray the owner and general manager has kept us informed on how to best enjoy the food and drink as well as make for great conversation and atmosphere.  Don't miss out, this place will always be packed as the word gets out!"}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing. The atmosphere was the most comfortable and welcoming I have been in to possibly ever. Raymond, the owner, sat with us and told us stories about what the building use to be and was just the most hospitable person I have ever met. This is his passion and you can really tell. Would definitely recommend to anyone who asked."}
{"text":"Every experience I've had here have been perfect!! Ray always makes us feel right and how like he is entertaining his own friends when he works. Sangrias are amazing!!! Tapas are good. Nice place to start or end the night."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to CoR. It has great ambiance in a mid-century modern building that has been tastefully remodeled. Food was good - we liked the potatoes and chorizo plate, the shrimp with sausage, and the chicken Vera Cruz. Nice wine list and good selection of beers. Service was attentive. Parking lot north of the building is small - be prepared to drive around the corner for additional parking. A few glitches as one would expect from a new restaurant- nothing too bad. Give it a try -we did and will be back."}
{"text":"I have been excited to try this new place in my neighborhood. I finally went a month after it opened for happy hour. Everything tasted great! We had calamari, bruschetta, shrimp and they were all delicious! I especially loved the bacon wrapped chicken on the happy hour menu. My only complaint would be that they did not offer a single glass of wine (not sangria) on the happy hour menu. I figured with the name of \"Cor Tapas and Wine\" I would at least have one option of red and/or white but I didn't :(. I will definitely go back because everything was very good! Hopefully next time I'll see some glasses of wine for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is a must see, from the Sangrias to the care the owners have taken in every detail of repositioning it from a postal location to a very cool vibe tapas and wine bar.  The only negative thing is the parking, but it's not like they don't have it, you just have to know where it is the first time (down a little further)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and were very pleased.  Fun place, good food and a nice selection of drinks.  This is the type of place Phoenix could use more of."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. My best friend made reservations to have my birthday party here. The owners were incredibly accommodating and made everyone feel welcomed. Their service was impeccable and they were constantly aware of what we needed. The food is also incredibly. The scallops are scrumptious and cant wait to go back for more!  I will definitely be planning future events here!"}
{"text":"Severely OVER PRICED!!! Maybe they're hoping you drink so much you won't notice the cost of the food. 3 average sized meatballs with nothing else...$12, 2 average sized shrimp and 1/2 Tablespoon salsa off the Happy Hour Menu...$6, 3 chicken bacon bites (literal bites) off of Happy Hour Menu...$4. Cost of ordering food until you actually get full....BANKRUPTCY! Actual flavor of food was decent, nothing to write home about, but not bad either. I only drank water, so I cannot judge the drinks, but my friends seemed to enjoy them. As far as best value for your money, I would recommend the meat and cheese board, pork tapas, and Osso Buco. Great live Spanish band."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a vacation and went for the paella, however I indulged in the brussel spout salad, and the flank steak (being from the Mid West I LOVE beef).  I had 2 of the house sangrias (the white and the red) both were flavorful and reminded me of the summer in Madrid--how coincidental I am back in a warm weathered place and brought nice memories.  The ambiance is well suited for the type of food served--a great job with making cement aesthetically appealing!  It is like the old meat packing district in lower Manhattan (before it became commercial) with great ideas--but only for the locals!!  Overall, the food was good, the cocktails/sangrias were GREAT, and the environment makes it an enjoyable place for a couple or groups of friends to gather.  Good job!  Jason"}
{"text":"I attended the opening on Saturday. Lively space and great decor. My friends and I were treated to a red sangria while waiting for our table. We tried 4 different plates all of which had great flavors. My favorite was the crispy chorizo chips served with the shrimp and the fingerlings potato plate. Blood orange beer is one of the best I've tried. Very friendly staff. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night & enjoyed the live musician they had that evening. She had a lovely voice & sang a variety of songs from current ones to 80s songs. Definitely made the evening a bit more lively. I came here primarily for the wine & enjoyed the wine I had. I only sampled one of the tapas, which was the French fries with aioli. Portions were small, but I knew it was tapas only so I expected smaller portions. However, prices were a bit expensive considering the portion sizes. Overall tasty tapas & wine, but expect to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! So impressed with the food, service and overall ambiance! We celebrated a 16 Person Birthday Dinner and the Owners and Staff were so accommodating from the moment I called to the moment we left. They were so attentive to our party and made recommendations and were so helpful when it came to the menu! The food was Amazing!! We had the Paella, BBQ Pork, Chorizo and Shrimp, Pollo con Arroz and Scallops! Soooo delicious and perfect portions!! We wish them the best and we will sure visit them again!!!"}
{"text":"Great time tonight listening to the music and harmonica while painting with Vino and Canvas!  The food was amazing. The spicy shrimp and chorizo and the paella are awesome.  Cant wait to come back in Flamenco night!"}
{"text":"It's sad to see past employees making a bad name for a new neighborhood business. I'm glad to see anyone that wants to invest in the area and bring something new, so thank you.   I thought the food was cool and interesting. Items you don't see all around town. The tapas concept has always been something I like, gives me the chance to experience several different items.   The wine and cocktail list was also very interesting. I always admire someone that tries to incorporate new experiences and originality. Wines from all over the world and labels you may have never heard of. Shaken sangrias???? Never heard of them before but Very fun and tasty  Thank you and look forward to more"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood!  This is a great place to meet friends for drinks and small tapas plates. Everything we had was delicious, but my favorite was the hummus with fried artichokes.  The restaurant is a comfortable and welcoming place. A real neighborhood gem. My friends and I have already made plans to return."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here. Ray and his crew were welcoming. They discussed the menu, made recommendations and sat down with us for some laughs! Small portions, the food was delectable. Jordana and I will be back so watch out Ray! :)   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's hard to read bad reviews for place that's been open for a week. Needless to say I needed experience it myself and make my own judgement and absolutely glad I did. First off, this place is absolutely so cute! I met one of the owners, believe his name was Ray and I learned he does the paintings himself which alone is amazing! I had the calamari tapa which was AMAZING. I also had two red and white sangria's which were highly addicting. I see myself definitely going back. My experience was not bad in any way, staff seemed very happy to work there ."}
{"text":"I have dined her a number of times. Each and every time I like it that much more. Last night we had shrimp, caprese salad! (yum), calamari Fritti (perfectly cooked), steak, spicy scallops, and paella.  HIGHLY Recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner and experience. We received not only 5 star service but the food and drinks were wonderful. The sangria and wine menu is something I really enjoyed and will return for. Our group ordered about half the menu and everything was outstanding. We very much enjoyed the intimate setting and is refreshing to have a new and unique menu and setting to add to Phoenix. Can't want to come back."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place; unfortunately, we were left disappointed. We had a party of 7. Though we had a fairly good waiter, our food orders took way too long to get to the table - we were told they only had one person preparing food. We also didn't realize that happy hour prices only applied to folks sitting at the bar - had we known this we wouldn't have bothered with this place .... which was 60-70% empty from 5-8:30pm on a Friday night. This was curious to us - too many unsatisfied customers? We hope they get their act together because it seems like this place has potential. Updated response to owner: If you'd like to take a moment to check your receipts, we were Table 19 on 9/16/16 - arrived at 5:06pm and finally left at 8:13pm. We spent $224.78 and left a 20% plus tip despite the long wait for our food. As you'll see, we did not get a discount (as you claim), but our waiter did offer us 2 free desserts. When we asked how long it would take to prepare, he said it was hard to tell. We declined the offer because we had already been there for over 3 hours (mostly waiting for our food). I can post a photo of my receipt, if requested."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try CoR and give 5 stars to the place and the service. Incredibly welcoming and the decorating very tastefully done. Unfortunately the food was a miss and in turn made you feel that the price of the meal just wasn't there. The paella was delicious. The tuna was dry and didn't really have much flavor. The steak was nice, but the winner on the plate was the spinach. The shrimp with chorizo dish was incredibly greasy. Yes, I know chorizo is greasy . . . but the chorizo was almost like beef jerky in consistency, so you didn't even get the joy of the grease. The dessert was a favorite part."}
{"text":"I heard this place opened via Yelp, so we decided to stop in last Saturday night for a cheese and charcuterie board accompanied by a glass of wine.  My cava was perfect and so was the cheese and charcuterie selection.  The bartender and the owners were so welcoming and talked us through the menu on what to order when we visit next time.  We can't wait to try out the tapas...everything looked amazing that came out of the kitchen.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely neat! Food is great, atmosphere is ultra lifted with great music and art. The place itself is a beautiful work of art. The house sangria red and white are refreshing AF. The people there defiantly know how to keep the positive vibes going too. The place has so much history to the owners and you could see it by the way they specifically made everything to what it is. A must go place.   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"}
{"text":"The tapas are fantastic.  The food is fantastic.  Amazing sangrias.  Excellent wine selection.  Interesting art decor.  Specialty alcohol behind the counter.  White port for dessert.  Speaking of dessert ... the triple delight is fan-****ing-tastic!!!  Two large spoons of creme brulee, two large bites of chocolate cake and a small bowl of amazing bread pudding.  What really sets this place apart?  Attentive and impeccable service.  It is obvious that the management and ownership behind this place \"care\" about the quality of your overall experience.  Food, drink, wine, art, music, etc...    This place is very fresh, unique and vibrant.  It is definitely not, \"yet-another-hipster clone\"."}
{"text":"Great people great drinks and great food!! Always a fun environment the people around the bar are always fun and willing to engage in conversation."}
{"text":"Went to this fabulous new restaurant last night with my husband. Wow!!!!! This hot sexy little local gem has an ambiance along with outstanding and creative tapas. The owners Ray and Corey are hospitable, courteous and attentive enough. We got there at about 6:30ish and there was hardly anybody there. Within the hour this place was hopping!!!! Let's support this local gem and spread the word...."}
{"text":"GF and I had been meaning to try this place. We went for dinner on a Friday night...note that they ARE closed Sunday's and Monday's. The concept is cool enough, although kind of overplayed in the valley. It's basically what you'd expect from a tapas/wine place: trendy decor, small plates, good wine list. We were the only ones at a table at 7pm on a Friday night. Everyone else was at the bar having a good ol time. Food was overpriced for what you get. Tasty, but not worth the nearly $60 tab. We got the hummus, bravatas, short ribs, and another plate I can't remember. Again, everything was tasty, but scope out some other tapas places before consider this."}
{"text":"I went to Cor Tapas  for the first time last night and it was an amazing experience.  Everything  from the staff who were friendly and wonderful ,  to the food perfect.  Ray an owner is warm and inviting, was  kind enough to show me around and tell me details about all the beautiful extra touches that they put into building this restaurant. The food was incredibly fresh delicious,  original very very good   A very  pleasant experience. We are  so lucky to have this gem in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Horrible! Not at all authentic. I ordered a cheeseboard as an appetizer that took 45+ minutes to get to me. Even though there was only one other table with a group of 3 people. The waiter who was new was just as perplexed as I was because not even he understood why it was taking so long.  I ordered the patatas bravas and the meatballs for dinner and the potatoes were horrendous! Nothing like the real deal not even a little close to it! It was basically bad breakfast potatoes. The meatballs were ok but other then that the restaurant's atmosphere was completely dead and it was so freezing cold in there. Basically I'm never EVER eating here again.   P.S. the bread that came with the cheeseboard was all burnt."}
{"text":"In town for business/pleasure from Carlsbad, CA.  Found CoR on Yelp and our family loves tapas. And we were not disappointed.  Food was amazing ... We had: Penne Bolognese, Patatas Fritas aioli, Paella, shrimp and chorizo, and steak.  Add a wonderful desert accommodated for our children.  And Service.... was equal in quality to their food. This would be a regular place for us if we were locals."}
{"text":"Awesome food, extremely attentive and knowledgable staff, and I came on a night that they had live music which was also awesome!!   The musicians brought everybody together and made sure everybody had a great time!   The owner, Ray, is extremely friendly and really cares about the atmosphere and making sure his guests enjoy their experience. I'm vegan and he actually sat down and walked me through the menu and told me what he could do to accommodate me so I could enjoy some of the food despite my dietary restrictions. That is extremely refreshing to me as somebody who typically can't have much (if anything) at a tapas restaurant.   I had the \"Cor-tobello\" which he personally made sure was cooked to fit my needs! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The owner and wait staff are super friendly and it's a really cool place.  I want to give this place more stars, but can't get past the high prices for very small bites of not great food. I'll be glad when the tapas fad has ended and we can go back to paying $15 for a full plate of food instead of $13-$15 for a few tiny bites. After a $62 bill (that was only one beer and the rest food) my wife and I were starving and had to go somewhere else to eat.  The meatballs were so dry when I cut into them they crumbled. The bacon wrapped chicken bites (only 3 bites smaller than a golf ball) were also very over cooked. My friends said normally the food is much better so maybe they were having an off night. We did enjoy the flamingo singers/dancer."}
{"text":"So I'll probably not go here again. That has nothing to do with them, it's just not my kind of place. I've been conditioned over the years to see big plates of food. Not that I need them.  We went on Christmas eve and it was a pretty slow night for them.  From the moment we were greeted walking in the door to a short chat with one of the owners, Ray, on our way out the service was stellar. There was a long pause between the salad and the steak but we were busy talking anyway so it did not become awkward.  All of the food was well prepared and well plated. Very tasty stuff. And the bill was not out of line for the quality of service and food. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I would have liked a little more light to read the menu, we ended up moving the candle around."}
{"text":"Very excited that we have this amazing new neighborhood spot!  The food and drinks are so beautifully crafted and the staff that I had interacted with were delightful!  I'm excited to go back, enjoy a different drink, and to try new dishes that the menu has to offer!"}
{"text":"CoR is a welcome addition to our emerging neighborhood here on 12th St.  My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the restaurant about a week ago and we had a wonderful time.  Firstly,  the design and execution of the modern aesthetic & ambiance at CoR is reason enough to visit.  As for the food, our charcuterie board was perhaps the finest selection of meat and cheeses I have seen in a restaurant in many many years.  The selections were both enlightening and delicious.  Our lamb Osso Buco was served on a beautifully prepared polenta.  I would have preferred to have has seen some type of balsamic reduction over the lamb vs. the sauce presented, however, the meat was expertly braised and the portion was generous.  In addition to a wonderful caprese salad we sampled the scallops which were once again beautifully cooked and of an exceptional quality.  My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that the dish was over salted.  One of the owners was kind enough to be our sommelier for the evening and we were offered two spectacular wine pairings.  A specialty cocktail my wife ordered was original, refreshing and delicious as well.  Overall I am giving the restaurant 4 stars despite a few kinks that I am sure will be worked out over the next few weeks.  I have no doubt that CoR is going to establish itself as a weekly eatery for us and others that own and live in the area.  You have to appreciate the visionary concept and refreshing menu choices offered and we should all support anyone willing to take a chance on building such a beautiful concept restaurant in our pocket area.  On top of a tremendous amount of potential, the owners were about the most gracious hosts you could ask for."}
{"text":"Before you go, know that \"tapas\" are small plates that cost between $8-20 each. With two people, you can easily spend $60 and still not be full. Also, don't expect to leave with a doggy bag...    Now that you have set the expectations above, you can appreciate this restaurant. The private parking lot was small and it was full but we managed to find one spot. I don't even know where others would park if there had been more people. When we walked in, the place has character with lots of class, intimate and fun. There was a big group of people celebrating a birthday party so it was quite loud.   We were seated in the corner for two and we first order red sangria. They were sweet and strong - just how I like them! Our server was the only server in the restaurant but she worked the room well. Not once did we feel ignored.  I asked her what her recommendations were and she said the Osso Buco and Paella. We order them with the Brussels Sprout salad. The Osso Buco was tender and savory and the Paella was rich with so much flavor! We didn't leave anything on the plate. The Brussels sprouts salad was ok - not the best dish we had, but I guess you can't go wrong with eating vegetables. In my opinion, I would skip for $9. After three dishes, we weren't full (not a surprise) so we order the Patatas Fritas with meat which is exactly what we needed to get full.  We asked for our check and the bill came to a little less than $70 plus tip. It's not cheap, but I expected it to be that price. Overall, I think this restaurant is a great addition to this area and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I discovered COR Tapas last Friday night with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We shared the hummus, meatballs, pork belly, and potatoes.  The first three were excellent- extremely flavorful.  These three dishes definitely qualify as 'foodie' IMO. The potatoes were just ok.  I tried the white sangria which was an untraditional twist on the original that I didn't care for- overwhelming taste of alcohol and no solid fruit.  The server, Ana, was friendly and extremely attentive- anticipating all of our needs.  The restaurant is small and intimate, however with nothing but hard surfaces it is extremely loud.  There was a large group dining when we were there and we had trouble hearing each other over the noise.  Overall the food and service were excellent and I will return."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! Fun atmosphere, good drink menu, awesome food and great service! The owner made a special effort to talk with every person at our table to ensure we were getting the best service possible. He made it a point to see every table in the restaurant which was very inspiring to see. I went for a birthday celebration on a night of live music and cannot wait to go back!!!! PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"Awesome Tapas!  Scallops & mussels are very good.  Brussel Sprout Salad is yummy & great wine list!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this used to be an old paper store/post office. They did an excellent job with the interior and exterior decorating. I was excited to try it out after the long wait.  Staff: The waitress asked my date and I way to many personal questions. We were there for about 45-minutes and the she talked for at least 15-minutes about her dog and previous jobs.  The waitress and waiter started to fold napkins/silverware one table away from us. Very impolite.  Food: Started with the steak. Came out extremely cold. I informed the waitress it was cold and she came back telling me they cooked it medium and apologized for cooking it like that. I was confused because I asked for it rare and she missed the main point that the food was served cold. After this I did not want to gamble on more cold food.  Cost: $35 for 3 drinks and 5 slices of steak.  Compliment/Response from employee:  First let me tell you at that time that you came in my co worker and I had already put in a two week notice at this establishment number 2 the reason I was talking to you and your date is because I know her Nancy I worked together and you knew that she was talking to me as well so about the steak I told you it was served medium rare but I will have them fix it for you you know its people like you that go on this yelp because you're upset about your own personal life may be your date didn't go so well and try to hurt other people's jobs you should be ashamed and the reason we were doing roll ups because my co worker and I had to do a lot of work before we left with no help from nobody we were being abused and tormented by the manager but you didn't know that thank you very much you have a wonderful day I hope you feel very good about yourself  Response: An employee who does not even want to work there was serving me. Explains a lot. I was perfectly content with the small talk but you kept dragging it out. My date worked with you for two days so there was not much to talk about or that you two have in common.  Upset about my personal life? Date went bad? I now understand why you are not able to keep a steady job when you say things like this. My date and I still had a good time despite your poor service.  Why should I be ashamed for giving an honest review? If anything I was being nice.  It is obvious this is not the first time you have received feedback similar to this.  Abused and tormented? Please get over yourself. It is a very simple job."}
{"text":"We finally came here during restaurant week. It's a beautiful, contemporary place. We had 1. House and crafted sangrias - The house was the best. 2. Pan seared scallops - They were sweet and delicious.  3. Braised lamb - In general, I'm not a fan of lamb so this was all for my bf who loved it. 4. Pan seared steak - It was flavorful but tough/chewy. Allen, the bartender, was very attentive. We look forward to eating and drinking there again."}
{"text":"I can't believe phx finally got a very very good tapas restaurant.  Everything was top notch."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment because I really thought the atmosphere was nice. I reviewed the menu and although the prices were high I had expectations of really good food. I was not impressed. I ordered pan seared scallops, which are a favorite of mine for $17. I was highly dissapointed. Not only were they chewy, but I only got four. That's right!  Four scallops and nothing with it. No rice, no salad, no veggi. Four crappy scallops for $17. I would have made a huge fuss in the restaurant,  but I was on a date. Haha...not going back."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY over priced for mediocre food that was over cooked and under flavored. If you think this is good Spanish tapas, you have clearly never been to Spain or really anywhere they speak Spanish at all. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Went here before a movie with my Husband. We wanted some light tastings and wine before the show. This place is very pretty with wood floors, lots of natural light, cool music, and a very cool wine-bar vibe. The Owner greeted us and led us to our table. The server was so friendly and pleasant. A very nice wine menu! We ordered Tapas: Pulled Pork, Steak with chili, Albondigas (meatballs) and Serrano Dates with Blue Cheese. Oh My Goodness! These plates were AMAZING! We had such a pleasant night, flavors that just melted on the tongue! We had a small issue with our Meatball Tapa. We mentioned that to the Server. She immediately had the Owner come to our table and listen to our concern. He was so responsive, gave us another meatball, and we were so satisfied with this top-notch customer service. Don't miss this gem! We'll be back next weekend!"}
{"text":"We love Barcelona. COR is reminiscent of the tapas places in Barcelona. Great food and atmosphere. Service was excellent and friendly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and delicious tapas, and a block from my work!!? Yes! Cor winebar is my new favorite spot. The staff is over the top friendly and just fun. The wine selection is GREAT and reasonably priced, decor, trendy, yet classic and clean. The tapas is delicious and absolutely high quality. Alan is a great bartender and makes the experience amazing. I sometimes stroll in by myself and Alan always makes sure I have what I need and makes it a point to make me feel welcomed.  Ray, is just fun and goes out of his way to ensure everyone is happy with their food and drinks. If you are looking for something new, unique and just great, check this new neighborhood gem out. Also, if you add them on Facebook, you can see their live entertainment schedule."}
{"text":"Great! Great! Great! Place!! We got there soon after opening and were greeted like we were old friends. Loved that! Sat at the bar and sampled both the house red and white sangrias. Both so yummy!  Tasted several of the tapas dishes and all were delish. Need to return to try the craft sangrias!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! From the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you walk in the place is very modern and upscale! The service here was AMAZING -- A+! You even get filtered water with lemon slices, which is definitely an upgrade from the usual tap water you receive at restaurants. My family and I arrived there around 5 on a Tuesday (it opens at 4:30), so the place was pretty empty when we got there. It definitely started filling up around the time we left.  The owner, Ray, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks.  The food was excellent, although I thought that the steak and lamb were a little too salty. We had the CoR board, which contained manchego, burratta, sorpressata, figs wrapped in lardon, chorizo, kalamata olives, almonds, and other goodies. The presentation was beautiful on all the dishes and everything tasted great! Ray recommended the pan seared steak, the lamb, and the gambas (lemony shrimp in garlic), all three of which were delicious. We also ended up ordering the meatballs and the calamari, also very good!  The steak was definitely my fave! My mom also had a white sangria and said it was awesome, so the drink menu definitely doesn't disappoint. For dessert, we had the tres leches cake and the churros! Can you tell I eat a lot? The tres leches was perfect and had a great vanilla taste and the churros were crispy on the outside and still gooey on the inside. I would definitely come back if I lived in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has this many good reviews. The tapas were over priced and not that great.  I had pork belly, calamari, and mussels to start and they were pretty good. Then I ordered the bruschetta of the day which was just a dry piece of bread with some apples and a few figs which was totally underwhelming.  There are so many good places with bruschetta and this was an embarrassment, just put some nice cheese on there! Then it got worse when we ordered the meatballs that took forever to make apparently. They tasted like burnt dog treats, I'm not convinced there was actually meat in there and we had to send it back.  The service was OK. The girl we had needed to be flagged down if our drinks were empty and she made a snotty comment about how this place was \"Spanish not Italian\" when my friend requested some bread hahaha well maybe you should take some tips from the Italians on how to make meatballs!!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! It's only been opened a couple months but more than rivals some of the best Tapas in Vegas. The owner was exceptionally pleasant and even upgraded our bottle of wine to a more expensive wine but at a cheaper price! The entire staff was quick, pleasant and attentive. We absolutely loved every dish we tried from the Brussel sprout salad to the dates! The atmosphere was very pleasant and romantic, but also ideal for our party of three. Well worth every penny we spent. Would come back in a heart beat!! Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place,very friendly great food and cozy. We were greeted immediately and the server explained the menu. The wine pairing was fantastic, I'll return again"}
{"text":"A lovely Tapas and Wine bar new to the Central corridor area. I had won some gift cards at a charity auction and was itching to try this place. We went on Christmas Eve and had a lovely evening. The owner stopped by our table and the server was just fantastic. We felt spoiled. It was a lovely evening.   Remember if you go Tapas are small plates. Americans struggle with this concept so please come prepared for small plates and to eat like a European. It annoys me to read bad reviews based on the fact that is what the restaurant is specializing in serving. If you want large plates go somewhere else.   We had the Flank steak, Bruschetta, and Brussel Sprout salad. Everything was great! Their sampler dessert was out of this world.   Thank you and good luck in the hood with your new digs!"}
