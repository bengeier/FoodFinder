{"text":"A delicious throwback to a time when ice cream was made and not manufactured.  The best soft-serve I have had, possibly ever, and the large is cone is so generously filled I had a hard time finishing...but I did.  Like an In-N-Out burger in Cali, I will make a special trip to Difiore's whenever I visit Steel Town."}
{"text":"This place has a bad reputation for a reason. Ordered 2 ice cream cones and the guy blurted out \"TEN DOLLARS.\" Hold up- it says 3.30 each. \"Well the waffle cone is 1.75 and then plus tax.\" Umm... still doesn't add up. It was one of those situations where 15 seconds later you're beating yourself up because you should have told them to GET BENT! Not what I want when I go to get ice cream. Greedy filthy people who basically stole my money because I didn't feel like confronting them any further."}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!! They obviously know nothing about customer service!  If you do not like the public hire someone who does!  The coffee is the worst oh and don't even get me stsrted on the fudge (overpriced and terrible) $7.99 for 1/4 lb? He gets you becuase there are no prices on the stale week old pastries! The owner is so rude! Word of advice.....you are sitting on a gold mine, hire some friendly smiling faces and stay behind the scenes......"}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre ice cream.  Owner was extremely rude and rang up our bill incorrectly.  When we noticed (immediately after being handed our change) he told us too bad."}
{"text":"Low quality..high price for some shaved ice and no room to sit indoors.  Outdoors is a dirty street with a bunch of bars around the block, and that kind of crowd.  Don't bring your kids."}
{"text":"Take the Duquesne Incline up to Mount Washington for beautiful city views, walk across one mile of beautiful views to the Monongahela for the trip back down. A pit stop at Difiore's makes it all worthwhile. Try the lemon pie, it's delite-fully fresh. They have soft serve too and lots of different cones/waffle bowls. Bonus: you can eat it on the way back down."}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry milkshake when I visited this establishment. I tasted the milkshake and it was not the correct flavor. It had a very artificial cherry-like taste. I had multiple friends of mine try the drink and agree it did not taste right. I went back to the window to exchange for a regular vanilla shake and the owner insisted it was the correct flavoring. He then proceded to intimidate me from questioning further. I told him I would not return to the establishment and left my milkshake there. I am shocked by the service I recieved. I do not recomend disagreeing with the management of this establishment."}
{"text":"Was floored by a $4 (small twist cone) - I thought it was not our order, but the 'baby' cone that came out was mine!  .  Just seemed like we were robbed!  Wish I would've read the reviews before going here!  Would've waited to hit Molly's later!  More for the $."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a visit to the Mount Washington with about fifteen other people in the evening. They handled the sudden crowd pretty efficiently (I say \"crowd\" because the shop is tiny). Their selection of flavors was pretty standard, with soft-serve and hand-dipped ice cream and a variety of cones or cups. I had hand-dipped peach ice cream in a cake cone, which was pretty good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their ice cream too. The serving size was decent, though the price is a little higher than other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Same as other reviewers... Service is just pouty and seem frustrated to deal with you.    Man shut screen in our faces. Woman seemed we were bothering her. When the guy behind us joked about not needing to ring the bell man behind the counter looked so ticked off. This is our 2nd time coming up the incline being that my son is starting at CMU. Hey Ice cream people... Don't you realize that there are families like ours that are excited to be up there? That we've been planning our trip for 3 months and telling the 7 yr old about how she can get an ice cram at the top? How about a smile for your customers?"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone. When we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn't offer any solutions."}
{"text":"LOVE love love this place!  The owner is really cool.  They have the BEST cannoli's I have ever had (and I am an east coast girl who knows her cannoli's :) ).  You have to check this place out.  The Dark Chocolate Mocha is also amazing."}
{"text":"Great place to grab food on beautiful Mt. Washington! Awesome service, awesome ice cream, it's a must go when your there!"}
{"text":"Difiore's ice-cream is so good! It's located right by the Duquesne incline and the overlooks. It's nice to grab some icecream and head over to the overlook. The icecream and the frozen yogurt is really tasty! They also make really good food as well as icecream and frozen yogurt. It's a cute little family owned shop. Parking can be a little difficult right infront of the shop, but you can always find a spot down a little more."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great. I think people's opinions are jumbled due to the spectacular view of Mt. Washington. Imagine..... Grab ice cream, see a breathtaking view and you combine it into........... that's right.......  breathtaking ice cream! Nononono... It's good, but not great!"}
{"text":"I came here and had the worst experience and service, and I'm so glad to read all these reviews and realize that my family and I aren't crazy and that the gentlemen attending people is just flat out RUDE! If you hate dealing with people then maybe you shouldn't be working with them on the daily basis. It's ice cream! Not everybody is sure of what they want, and it should be a relaxing and enjoyable experience and that is definitely not what you'll get here! Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else,anywhere! just not here!"}
{"text":"We were invited to the Mt. Washington Business District for an evening with family and were taken to Difiore's Ice Cream Delite for dessert.  Having a 3yo and 5yo made the experience all the better; they were thrilled at the choice of ice cream cones.  They had plain, chocolate sprinkles and rainbow sprinkles.  The best part of the experience was finding something on the menu for our three year old that is lactose intolerant.  It is nice not having to give her medicine or to have her opt out.    The service was warm and welcoming and we look forward to visiting again.  The kids are already asking for the ice cream shop near the skyline!"}
{"text":"poor selection, poor service, cash only, pricey for soft serve. do yourself a favor and skip this"}
{"text":"Did not see cash only sign... got a soft serve cone (which was tiny) and told to go to the owners coffee shop to use ATM. It said closed on door so walked back and the owner said the door was open and to walk in because he owned it (like I was supposed to know that). By the time I walked back my little expensive baby ice cream was melted all over the cone and counter and STILL made me purchase it! I asked for a cup to put my melted ice cream in and the owner seemed agitated at this. Bad customer service, rude owner. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The ice cream is good. The selection of flavors wasn't amazing and they only have soft serve chocolate no ice cream chocolate. The guy taking our order wasn't very nice either. Seemed impatient. Didn't hand me my change back just kind of slapped it on the counter and walked away."}
{"text":"Definitely a tourist trap! It's at a convenient location right by Mt. Washington overlook. On a hot summer day, it's very tempting to swing by this bright pink ice cream shop to satisfy that sweet tooth. But do try very hard to resist the temptation because this place is too overpriced for mediocre ice cream and the service is awful. There aren't that many options and their serving size is pathetic. I nearly paid $5 for like 3 bites of soft serve ice cream. If you come here, you will pretty much be paying for the convenience, not the food. I do NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here twice during my visit and loved my ice cream (a sundae with peanut butter and marshmallow). The prices are a little steep, but in that area, there's not much to snack on, so I was fine forking over $5 for a cup. They ONLY TAKE CASH, so keep that in mind when you visit. There was a big backyard patio with plenty of tables to sit in. Both times I went it was on a weekday and pretty quiet, but I did drive by a 3rd time on a weekend afternoon and saw a huge line and decided against another sundae on my trip. The service is so-so but to be honest, you just get your ice cream and go so it's not like you're really interacting with the people behind the window for more than 2 minutes. The ice cream is good enough that I personally wasn't too worried about the frostiness of the cashier."}
{"text":"The soft serve ice cream is just that, typical fare, nothing out of this world ... just good soft serve.  The hand scooped ice cream, on the other hand, AWESOME.  If we went by just taste, this would be 4*s.  There are two knocks on this place.  First, a small one, it is cash only.  There's an ATM nearby, but the year is 2017 and this place doesn't have any direct competition.  Even a \"minimum charge\" would be better than being cash only.  The bigger knock, there's a particular employee that's less than friendly.  To the point of being downright rude to some.  It's not like \"mean,\" it's mostly just a rather \"impatient\" approach to his customer service style.  Cranky.  He just was cranky.  And I wasn't the only one that felt that way.  At the end of the day, this place is IT in the area outside of Shiloh's across the street and they're not even direct competitors."}
{"text":"Totally not understanding all the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I walk up to Shiloh often and get ice cream here. The ice cream is yummy, and their blizzards are wonderful (lots of mix-ins). The food is cheap and good. We got a chicken sandwich and a meatball sub. It's not the same caliber of food you'll get at Shiloh Grill or Summit, but it's also not even close to the same price. The seating in the back is fine. I don't know why anyone would be mad that there isn't a \"view\" because the shop is too far down Shiloh to have any sort of view of the city.  The owner, who many have critiqued, is good. He's not the kind of man who is going to smile at you and chat for 10 minutes and talk to your kids, but I've frequented his shop here and his coffee shop, and he's always been friendly, quick, and very competent. So if you want Mr Rogers, then pop that into your VHS. Otherwise, just be okay with a guy who's doing his job well and getting you yummy ice cream.  In conclusion, this place is fun and a great place to get ice cream on the Mount!"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, but rude service! The website said they closed at 11pm so we got there around 9:50pm expecting it to be open for another hour. When we got there we saw it was cash only and asked the woman at the cashier where the closest ATM is, she gave us a very rude response and blew us off. The other man there told us where the nearest ATM is which is where we went to withdraw cash. The ice cream was very good--slightly overpriced in my opinion though."}
{"text":"This place is a total rip off. $9 bucks for 2 ice cream cones- soft serve. For a cash only joint, this place is a total waste. PS- the service sucks badly. The guy working is either pissed off at the world or had the worst day in his life.  Do not go here. Save your hard-earned cash."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Ice cream is good, but ridiculously expensive. Go somewhere else.   Expect $4 for a single sugar come. Over $6 for a double.   Don't hesitate when your turn is up if you don't want an annoyed, rude man behind the window."}
{"text":"My family was in town visiting from Michigan. I have 5 nieces and a nephew that I had so excited to get ice cream at the top of the 'big mountain'.   The weather was starting to get bad. It was about 6:30 and they were just locking the doors as we walked up. They saw the looks on the kids faces and opened back up to give us cones. Seriously awesome service and made the kids day!!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My rating may be slightly biased as it was a very hot day and we were tired from walking. My brother got a sundae with strawberry, pineapple, and whipped cream toppings. I got a strawberry smoothie. The lady at the side window was very courteous and even helped my mom with directions to the nearest restroom. My smoothie was cool and delicious, and so was the sundae, although a bit on the sweet side. I am from San Francisco so the inflated prices are somewhat high to me but for most other people I understand if you think this place is way over priced."}
{"text":"We use to love this ice cream place.  Recently, we ordered two waffle bowls.  At $12:50, they were small, hard and the ice cream did not taste fresh.  The hot fudge had a funny taste.  The male owner was rude and pushy.  I tried to overlook his rude demeanor.  At first, I thought it was because of our ethnicity.  But, I think he treats everyone that way.  One would think, when you own a business, you would appreciate your customers.  Not at this establishment.  This will be our last time visiting."}
{"text":"Eh, what's to write?  They were super convenient, but that's about all they had going for them.  There were a couple soft serve flavors, a few frozen yogurt flavors, and a few hand-scooped flavors.  Nothing was spectacular, though I do like that they had the chocolate dipped waffle cones covered with nuts."}
{"text":"0/5 Stars.  Other people have been letting others know to stay away from this place for a good reason. The service is garbage... I am normally not so blunt but could not help myself.   I unfortunately have been to this location on more than one occasion due to out of town guests all wanting an ice cream cone and not listening to my warnings. Every time we leave, we talk about how rude the counter staff is. The last time one I was there, one of the people in our party (not me I will not give this establishment $.01 of my money) asked for vanilla ice cream cone. They received a dish. When they let the server know that they had asked for a cone the server refused to fix the order due to them being \"too busy\". The solution was an empty cone shoved at the person in our party through the window. They were told to place the cone on-top of the ice cream in the dish.   Seriously... Lets be real. We are ordering ice cream hear not dealing with a life or death situation if they had taken the time to correct the error maybe, I would have seen that each time I had been there previously was maybe a bad day. Instead, they went on to prove that the staff/ ownership doesn't care what the experience is like as long as they are raking in your $$$.   Stay away folks. There are more reviews below that will tell similar stories.   To the owners,   If you read this post. Please do something about your service."}
{"text":"Menu is rather small soft serve is So so prices are reasonable. Service not very friendly. Very small interior with limited seating. If your In the area I would opt for Page dairy mart instead."}
{"text":"Friendly ice cream shop with great ice cream and a smile. Perfectly located in proximity to Pittsburgh's  most breathtaking view, you can walk along Grandview as you enjoy your frozen treat.  I stopped here last night to borrow a chair, after my request was turned down by 3 other establishments. They smiled and instantly said yes. Their friendly concern to help was remarkable, and I will continue to support them with my business."}
{"text":"I read the negative reviews about this place before coming... and honestly, I probably wouldn't have visited at all if I didn't have an ice cream craving while taking a walk on Grandview. My friends and I stopped by on a Sunday evening- there was a line on the side of the building, like there normally is. Walked up to the window and ordered a simple, strawberry sundae with twist ice cream. The man working was clearly miserable. He looked as if he was annoyed to wait on me. One of my friends ordered a cyclone with cookie dough and the man actually told him that he \"hates making those\" and could have made \"10 ice cream cones\" for the time it took to make his one item. Who says that to a paying customer? None of us could believe how miserable this guy is. I wish this place wasn't as popular, because they don't deserve it. Terrible customer service, mediocre ice cream and high prices. I believe they are still open only because there really aren't any competitors near them.   Overall- Skip this place and go down the hill to South Side for some ice cream."}
{"text":"The guy in the window was the biggest a**hole ever!  Rude, ignorant, annoyed by us ordering and paying for their ice cream which we didn't  really have a choice of.  He basically  gave us what HE wanted!  And the ice cream is very plain.  Nothing to write home about!  Awful attitude.   Never, ever, ever would my family and I go back!  Shouldn't  be in business!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about ice cream? I think it's pretty hard to have bad ice cream.  The ice cream here is good, and they do have some nice specialties and options. However, sometimes the service is spotty. It strikes me as the kind of place that makes most of its money off tourists that come up the incline - since most of its customers aren't regulars, they don't have to have great service.  That said, I live in the neighborhood and still go fairly regularly, since it's convenient and the quality is good. However, if I REALLY want good ice cream, I always head down to Page's Dairy Mart."}
{"text":"When I moved to Mt Washington I was excited there was an ice cream parlor close to my home.  I went there once and am not going back.  The man who owns/runs the place is rude.  He was very inconvenienced that I showed up one night trying to give him business.  He had a huge attitude and sort of snatched the money from my hand when we went to pay.  They do not have many flavors of hand dip ice cream either.  I didn't bother to ask if I could try any......"}
{"text":"This totally IS a tourist trap. There are signs down the block as soon as you get off the monorail thing to go up the Mountain in Pittsburgh. Though, I was a tourist for the day in a not so touristy town. Also, I LOVE ice cream and there aren't that many places to go to up here. Kind of a cute mom and pop shop. You can tell its been around for ages. At least since my sister was in college. ha.   They only have 4 or 5 soft serve flavors and then a few scoop ice creams. I settled for a mix of chocolate/vanilla because the only other flavors were apple pie and French vanilla bean and neither jumped out at me. My sister got Moose tracks ice cream. Much more decadent. She also made sure to slather on some cherry sauce because she's weird like that. Though, the combination of her concoction actually was pretty great and tasted like a cherry Garcia sundae with peanut butter cups. Crazy. My small waffle cone was about 8 times the size I expected for its value and I appreciate it. There's no where to sit really inside so take your cones to go and enjoy that fresh Mountain air!"}
{"text":"Ordered a $5 mango smoothie.  Can tell fresh fruit was not used. Alright. Prob won't return. Outdoor seating In the back with no view."}
{"text":"Came for a quick cone before getting on the tram. It is what is to be expected from a small ice cream shop."}
{"text":"The ice cream is delicious but the prices are way higher than stated on the menu and the workers are extremely rude."}
{"text":"I like this place.  They have fat free frozen yogurt in pistachio which is amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get soft serve from in all of Pittsburgh. They have HUGE servings, and you can walk a block to eat your ice cream while overlooking downtown. The banana splits are to die for! They also have a coffee shop two doors down that has awesome lattes!"}
{"text":"Darren and I tag teamed a Cookie Fudge Sundae with soft serve ice cream. Mmmmm. Especially when the fudge gets on the cookie. The place is small and gets packed though."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with a large patio.  Made the visit to Mount Washington complete.  They offer food choices, soft serve ice cream and hand dipped options.  They only accept cash so make a stop by the ATM first.  If you're in the area, this place is def worth a try!"}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is very obviously a tourist trap for those who've made their way up the Monongahela Incline. The ice cream is okay but the flavors are nothing special and prices are steep. Also, there isn't anywhere to sit inside the ice cream shop. Most of their tables are in what looks like their backyard, with no view."}
{"text":"The middle-to-older age man who works the counter is a total dick.  I brought my little brother up here while I visiting family during the first week of June. We walked up to the window and gave this guy a friendly greeting, \"Hi, how are you?\" and he just looked at us. Uh...ok. whatever. So my brother ordered a vanilla cone with sprinkles. This guy never asked what kind of cone, just disappeared and came back with a cake cone. My  brother had wanted a waffle cone. Ok, no biggie. Instead of making a big deal, I just said I'll eat the cake cone, and he got him his waffle cone. $10.50. wtf?? I live in LA, and even I think that is ridiculous. But whatever.  So we go to leave, and my brother (ever the polite teenager) said, \"Have a nice day!\" And again, this miserable fuck just looks at us.   Get some social and customer service skills, prick. PS, your ice cream sucks."}
{"text":"Very rude owner and service especially for mediocre grocery store ice cream sold at a high mark up.  The only thing they have going for them is the location, but skip it and walk a little further down the street to the bakery where you can actually sit down and get good service."}
{"text":"The ICE CREAM NAZI!! Oh man did we ever feel rushed by the man behind the little window for a group of 7. We spent $50 for 7 ice cream cones & 2 pints. Service makes this a zero for me. It was like he was mad at us for trying to spend money with him. Never again."}
{"text":"An ice cream parlor is supposed to be a happy place, unless you step foot into Difiore's. The outside promises so much till you walk in to a tiny lobby and rude staff pissed off that you're ordering ice cream from them.   We visited on a Sunday night and the (who I'm assuming) manager wasn't accommodating. Within 15 seconds he expected us to have made a choice and pointed to the options we had. Chill, sir. He seemed annoyed that we even stepped in. Strike one. The ice cream itself is nothing special. Typical soft serve that you get at a self-serve buffet. The worst part about it was it wasn't even cold. My frozen yogurt was already melting by the time I was handed my cone. I asked for a bowl since it was dripping and of course that was like asking for a first born. Two cones came to almost $10! Insane! Talk about a tourist trap. Strike two. The thing that bothered me the most during our visit was when my friend asked for his ice cream to be dipped on hot fudge. The guy told him \"No, man. It's too big.\" I've been to many ice cream parlors and a cone is never to big for dipping. Maybe the problem is that fact that your ice cream isn't cold and doesn't stay sturdy (and the fact that you're rude as ever). Your job as an employee (business owner) is to accomadate guests. Offer him hot fudge on the side! Jeez! Strike three. You're out, DiFiore's.   Save the aggravation and head to Page's on Carson Street. Much better service and product. I'm giving them two stars rather than one based on location alone. I guess you are allowed to give lousy service if you're the only ice cream shop in the area..."}
{"text":"I live in Mt Washington and I've been to this place a few times,the first and second time we've been here was with my husband so I didn't experience the rudeness first hand,the third and the 4th time was when I was with my daughter who asked for ice cream after dropping some stuff at the nearby post office. Here's the thing,before you start ringing the bell,you gotta make sure that you know what to order or you'll get the impression that you are bothering the owner. She ordered a chocolate ice cream in a chocolate cone,few licks and it was dripping all over her little hand. I ordered a banana split delite,I think it was good and huge too maybe good for 2 person,I paid with cash cos they don't take cards and asked for napkins. Then the owner after handed me the change shut the windows in my face without saying a word. The service is very bad. I gave 2 stars because of the location."}
{"text":"Good and yummy ice cream. After riding in a toaster box up a hill in 100% humidity, I guess any ice cream would taste good! The service is friendly and the place is clean. I wanted the Big Fish Sandwich, but 1/2 a pound of fish is just too much \"see-food\" for me. This is a nice place to cool off in the summer."}
{"text":"Atop a hill overlooking Downtown Pittsburgh, this Ice cream shop is exactly what you need when you are looking to get fatter while you to take in the views! I experienced the Cinnamon crumb cake scoop on a sugar cone, it was a very cold day and I wasn't hungry. Talk about a great decision! It was very good and added to the experience! Well done Difore's, well done!"}
{"text":"Great location and okay selection and they're cash only. I am giving the 2 stars because I've been here a few times now and every time I find the service to be rude. It clearly doesn't stop me from going back but this most recent time it was extra annoying. Every time the person ringing us up acts like he or she has somewhere more important to be but this time rolled her eyes at my kid when he didn't instantly call out what he wanted. I'm not the type to wait while my child stammers out his order and changes his mind, I'm probably more impatient than anyone when it comes to getting ice cream in my hand. There was also no one behind us and it was just bizarre to be that rude.   We then made the mistake of asking if there was somewhere to sit which was a little cooler than the 90 degrees we were standing in and a guy popped up from behind the counter and told us to go across the street to the bar because they happily accept anyone who buys food from another place. Again, just bizarre."}
{"text":"Super rude service. The guy who seemed like the owner never smiled and was VERY unfriendly. Ice cream was only average. I'll never go here again. Wouldn't even give me a cup of  tap water after ordering two cones. Would only sell bottled water."}
{"text":"Went to dinner across the street at Shiloh Grill (amazing food there btw) and decided to get ice cream here. Guy through the side walk up 'window' was extremely rude and seemed very putout to have to take our order. Ice cream was the same as we could of had purchased anywhere (vanilla cone, twist cone and candy bar mashup cone). Hubby like his candy bar mash up, only reason this place even got a star... Do not bother going here, over priced average ice cream served by a very rude man"}
{"text":"It was okay. The guy behind the counter was rude when I asked to taste a few flavors. The ice cream was average. Nothing great and shiney about any of it. Eh"}
{"text":"Note: CASH ONLY!  Soft serve ice cream is a unique animal. Its velvety, ethereal. It takes on the shape of a candle when poured from the humming machines that produce it. It must be consumed quickly in the heat to avoid ice cream cone catastrophe.   It is what Difiore's excels at. Sure they have the harder variety, but for some reason, when I see the design of soft serve, one that recalls birthday cake decoration, I must have it.  Cookie Fantasy Delite: The name alone conjures decadence. To have it before me in a plastic dish was sin incarnate, especially when the two discs of dough and chocolate chips took on the copious amount of hot fudge that was pumped throughout the sundae. There was so much of the deadly sauce, the bottom of the transparent \"boat\"  almost became too warm to hold, making me devour the ice cream faster with Kay's help for fear of a dairy meltdown. The cookies were chewy, the lightness of the soft serve cut the evil of the hot fudge down a notch, and the canned whipped topping and Oreo detritus merely played the role of garnish.   A tourist trap? If so, this lifelong Pittsburgher stumbled into it willingly, and business is deservedly swinging, so much so, the small storefront could not contain the mass of sweet-craving humanity yesterday evening. Miraculously enough, we found a table in the corner. Although, we practically had to fight our way out of there after finishing our dessert.   This brings me to Howard Todd, the owner of both Difiore's and neighboring coffee hut Grand Brew. Mr. Todd is either superhuman or an android as this year he officially logged 2,000 consecutive days at work.   http://www.wtae.com/news/local/allegheny/Grandkids-inspire-ironman-worker-to-reach-2-000th-consecutive-day-on-job/-/10927008/12535870/-/rtyspyz/-/index.html  And watching him handle patron after patron without a single missed note or display of agitation was astonishing."}
{"text":"Soft serve ice cream was whipped with lots of air . Small cone was $3.00. Decent flavor, but it's just soft serve.    I got a cyclone ( similar to blizzard). There was very little peanut butter cup mixed in... Disappointing. Mostly a tourist place, high prices, basic food....high profit."}
{"text":"We stopped for a cone.  There was a disorganized line and it was hard to read the items available due to lack of light and all the people.  Then the guy in the window is a grouch!  Not sure why he was so grouchy but oh well, wished him a nice day and he shut the window.  The ice cream was good.  Not sure what brand,  Asked for a cone and the grouch did not ask what type of cone just gave us waffle cones.  We sat on the patio in the back that did not have any lights at all, probably should put in a few low watt lights so you can see where you are walking.  It must be nice to be able to have a business survive due to location not because of good service and product! Next time we will go elsewhere for our ice cream.  The meter maids were walking the street and parking lot giving lots of tickets, so be sure to find the parking station and put in you money and license #.  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a minus 1 star I would. This place has the worst customer service I have ever received!  I recommend to STAY AWAY from this place If you are visiting this quaint town. The owner has no patience, no service and courtesy skills.   Bad food, bad service & bad vibe = Bad reviews!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a ride on the incline to grab a coffee. It was the most delicious vanilla latte I've ever had! Deeelish! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was actually on my way home to grab some ice cream out of the freezer when I saw this place. The sign on the door said to go around to the side to order. Cash only. That's never a problem with me but they do have an ATM close by if you need it.  Since it was hot there was a line but it move fairly quickly. Most of the ice cream they serve is soft serve but they carry Dean's ice cream if you prefer the traditional. I knew there would be no way I could sample anything since people were behind me but I was blown away by the price. $3.50 for one scoop? Two would have run me over $6.00!   Mind you, I am willing to spend if I find what I am buying worthwhile but this wasn't the case here. I ordered one scoop of mint chocolate chip in a cup. It tasted just like ice cream you would get out of a grocery store. They have covered seating in the back to help protect you from the sun.  They sell food here and your usual ice cream flair but it seems to be the only one here in Mt. Washington. Since I was in the area on other business I had already paid my metered parking but I definitely would not go out of the way for this place when there are so many others that serve better quality. Too expensive for meh ice cream."}
{"text":"I get that this place is so close to incline but don't waste your time or hard earned money.  The service is absolutely horrible and it truly makes you upset.  The man makes you feel bad to order anything.  The owner obviously hates his job and doesn't want anything to do with you.  Asked for napkins and he opened the window and literally threw them at me.  Also, when opening the window somebody must of spilled the ice cream on the ground outside so he poured a pitcher a water right outside and all over me. I get that he was just cleaning the ice cream up but have a little decency to not pour it all over your customer.  I've talked to my family who also have been there in the past and said that he has been rude every time.  If you want bad service and ok ice cream go there..."}
{"text":"Service is RUDE and the ice cream isn't even all that great. $5.50 for a waffle cone that's got two scoops of deans ice cream? PLEASE... do your self a favor and head to Page's dairy mart on the south side. Their ice cream beats the shit out of this garbage, their service is friendly, and they won't over charge you like this place clearly does."}
{"text":"Seriously, who doesn't like ice cream?  Especially if it's right there in your own hood!    The only issue I have with this place is that it's usually ALWAYS packed in the summer!  But that's because....  Number one:  It's on one of the main streets in Mt. Washington Number two:  It's a tourist trap Number three: It's the only ice cream place on the street!    There you go, no competition!  The owner HAS to make a killing scoopin out the cones in the summer, for sure.  My fav flavor is the Birthday Cake ice cream.  It has cake, frosting and sprinkles mixed in.  YUMMO!  I was not a fan of the chocolate milkshake only because I don't like chocolate ice cream (I know, I'm weird) and they make it with that and choco syrup.  Too much!  If you're looking to go all out, the Brownie Sundae is divine!    So try to go on the off peak times like....the winter?    There's no fighting a strong urge for ice cream in the summer though, so if there's a long line, I'd still wait.  It moves fast, don't fight the urge!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after riding the incline up the hill. Don't let the cute and charming appeal confuse you. Front door was closed. Woman inside pointed to the window on side. We walked over and she told us because it was cold they weren't opening the inside. After giving us our ice cream (4 single scoops $13 way over priced) she said if we were cold to go into the coffee shop and let them know she sent us to sit. Unbelievable! She has a sitting area inside her ice cream shop. Besides that bizarre experience the ice cream was mediocre at best. No specialty flavors."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten their hot food yet, however, their ice cream options are solid.  The birthday cake cyclone, which is basically like a blizzard, is on point.  My wife always gets the cookie dough cyclone.  It also sits right beside the best view you can get of The Burgh.  Would recommend to anyone. However, Prices are extremely high.  That's the biggest issue."}
