{"text":"Best wings ever, and I love wings. I mean loooove wings. The crispy crunch is what sets it off. Both flavours are excellent and the sauce is thin, not dripping off of the wings and leaving a puddle on your plate. Korean tacos are also a hit, can't wait to try the pot stickers. Will absolutely be coming back. Service is also A+!!"}
{"text":"93.5 health rating for a restaurant barely open for 6 months? Pitiful!  I'll be surprised if they make it through the spring."}
{"text":"I ordered fried rice and paid an extra $2 for bulgogi. The rice came with barely any meat. The tiny pieces that were in there were so small it was hard to distinguish them from the rice. The fried shumai were burnt. If you like mall food courts, then you will love this place. If you have working taste buds and don't like wasting money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came for the Korean food because I always get excited when a new Korean place comes to town. Tried the beef bulgogi and was not disappointed. Good portion size, authentic flavors and came in a good amount of time. Staff was courteous and respectful, the atmosphere was pleasant. My only critique was the cost- for a $15+ plate of bulgogi, kimchi should be included on the side. I've never been to a Korean restaurant (in America or Korea) that charged $2.75 for a side of kimchi. It's a staple like ketchup or relish!! That being said, the kimchi was delicious."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from here a few times over the last month and it always arrives quickly and tasty! The barbecue chicken tacos and the sliders are the perfect. The menu sounds so delicious I can't wait to try more! Available on grub hub for the area and they deliver fast. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Great 80s music playing. Upbeat. Food is good. The calorie count on the menu is a plus. Yummy bulgogi and rice noodle dish. Great decor. Not your average asian restaurant. Upscale."}
{"text":"I went to this place a couple of days after going to Seoul Food Meat Company, and I personally liked this place more. The chicken was nice and crunchy and had the perfect amount of sauce, and they were spicy! A nice plus since I really enjoy spicy food. My family and I ordered a few appetizers, wings, and one entree and it was definitely enough for all us. Out of the appetizers I recommend getting the potstickers half and half, they're a nice treat!"}
{"text":"It's not very often that I try a new place and from the first bite of food am AMAZED!! This place is awesome. Cozy atmosphere with a nicely stocked bar, friendly wait staff, and fast service. I ordered the soy garlic wings!! LORD, have mercy!! Crunchy, and tender. Seasoned well and sauce was perfect. The fried rice... amazing. My biggest surprise was the bolgani tacos!!! Gotta get the tacos!! We will be back for this frequently! This is a must try spot. So happy we found this place!!"}
{"text":"Great wings. A little pricey than what are use to. Bigger pieces than usual. Got a combo of spicy and soy. Both very good. We love hot, and spicy were almost too spicy.  Next time probably just soy. My daughter got chicken tenders both sauces. Loved them both but spicy was hard for her to handle."}
{"text":"I had heard about Bonchon Korean Fried Chicken via WBT radio ad. I'm not really a fan of Asian cuisine, but since I REALLY love fried chicken-especially wings- I decided to stop in for a to-go order.  There's no doubt that these wings were very crispy and had the best crunch of any I've had, even after probably losing some of the crunch during the trip home. I ordered both spicy and soy garlic. Now, I love hot spicy, but these were almost too hot for me; the soy-garlic were top notch. We didn't care for the pickled radish that was included as a side, so I'll just let them keep that the next time. The wings have a distinct flavor due to the oil that they use - so they're not going to be exactly like typical southern fried chicken & wings. I'll def go back and dine in. The restaurant is quaint, has a bar, covered outdoor seating and the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly."}
{"text":"Ran in for some take out to give them a try.  The decor looked nice, and I was greeted right away.  I ordered the tenders (split, to try both flavors) and some edamame.    The edamame was a generous portion, and cooked and salted perfectly even as to go.  The tenders were delicious, uniques crispy like a batter or breading I haven't seen before.  The only reason they are 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would've liked more sauce on the tenders. Or even a side.  Sauce was very good, but too little of it."}
{"text":"My newest obsession- the chicken wings at Bonchon. I could eat these daily!  They are amazingly crispy.  The sauces are perfect. And the pickled daikon that they bring with the wings are the perfect accompaniment to the wings. I want to go now!!"}
{"text":"Hidden in the back of a plaza tucked in the corner is a cute spot with good food.  Shrimp fried dumplings on slaw, it's an appetizer big enough to share.  Edame are fresh and pretty large pods, very tasty with just enough salt sprinkled on top.  Chicken Fried Rice is short on chicken,  has tomatoes in it and heavy on a grll taste, it is just okay.  French fries are amazing and every table had them."}
{"text":"Wednesday lunch. Busy at 12:45. Starting with Potstickers, half spicy and half regular..food looks amazing so I have high hopes."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing. Incredibly crispy every time and very flavorful. The spicy is better imo but I usually get half and half.  I will say that I haven't tried anything else on their menu yet since the fried chicken is so good.   Good value, clean restaurant, friendly workers and incredible fried chicken."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday through Door Dash. The food was good but too spicy! I wasn't super crazy about the bulgogi, which is what I was mostly looking forward to. I think I just got too much \"fatty\" meat in mine."}
{"text":"Thumbs up!  Good food and atmosphere.  The manager/owner welcomed us and told us about the restaurant concept, menu, and Korean food details.  We had a great server who was very attentive.  We tried the spicy chicken wings, Kimchi, Korean tacos, and Bonchon wrap with soy garlic chicken.  Had plenty to bring home for left overs.  Everything we tried was excellent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"So this was my second trip...I wanted to get something that they were known for (instead of the wrap that I had before). I ordered a 10 piece strip mixed hall and half with an order of onion rings to go. There was no one in actual restaurant, one to go order picked up while I was there...so not busy. The onion rings attacked my sniffer the whole way home, I couldn't wait to rip in to them. I open the rings and they looked awesome, I open the strips and they look...they look like wings =( I'm eating them and they're good, but not what I ordered."}
{"text":"\"It is against our policy to give extra sauce.\" - The Management  Honestly, the wings were pretty good and crispy, and our server was friendly -- but the reason I'm leaving a one-star review is because of a ridiculous company policy.  When my spicy wings arrived, they were a little light on sauce.  I asked for extra sauce, and the waitress brought me a bottle of sriracha.  \"I don't want sriracha,\" I said.  \"I want more of the sauce that came on the wings.\"  The waitress explained that I can't have any more of that sauce.  Seriously.  \"It's a secret sauce,\" she explained.  When I asked what that had to do with me not getting enough sauce on my wings, she took me back to the kitchen and asked a cook in front of me if I could have more sauce.  \"No,\" he said. \"Company policy.\"  When I offered to pay, he rudely ignored me and walked away from the window.  The waitress rolled her eyes and apologized to me.  She obviously thought it was a stupid policy herself, but she said there was nothing she could do about it.  By that time, my wings were cold; but I didn't bother complaining, because I figured it was company policy to not reheat them either."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the food. I lived in California for 20 years where we had access to numerous Korean restaurants. I was so excited that bulgogi was on the menu so we ordered that, Korean fried chicken(1/2 and 1/2) and kimchi coleslaw. The bulgogi was disappointing and bland, the chicken was too salty tasting, and the kimchi coleslaw was just regular coleslaw with some kimchi added.  If you've had good, authentic Korean food before, don't bother with this place, otherwise you'll be disappointed! Gave two stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Visited last night with a friend. We were greeted by a lady and brought to the high table. My friend visited the restroom and as I sat down a young man showed up at the table immediately asking if he can get my order. I said I'm waiting for my friend and the waiter looked to the restroom and asked \"Is that your man?\". Number one faux pas. We said we needed some time to look at the menu. He came back after 3 minutes to take our order. We felt rushed.  Second, we tried to order one soup to split it and he said they couldn't (or wouldn't) do that due to the franchise law (okay?!). We received our order fairly quickly. The young waiter gave my friend his dish with the words \"Here you go, playboy!\". He left and we couldn't believe he just uttered those words. It's as if we didn't hear right, but we did! He called my friend a \"playboy\". Completely unprofessional and appalling.  We were there maybe 20 minutes eating and as my friend finished up the soup, the waiter came back to ask if we needed anything, to which we said, no and he just stood there and was rather pushy to ask if we wanted our check. Ummm, we were still eating! (he must've had to be somewhere important to want to close out our tab...).   As I looked around, I noticed that the floor was completely filthy, with food particles and drippings everywhere. It looked as if if hadn't been cleaned since they opened.  We left and both agreed that we wouldn't return because for the money you pay, the food is below mediocre at best and the service embarrassingly bad."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good chicken, but eating with my family all but me and my sister ate the wings we ordered. I didn't know what I wanted when we ordered because they had us order in less than one minute after we sat down and got the menus. Then my sister gets a salad as everyone gets a lot of wings. I wait till they come back to check if we were doing good and I order the Chicken Katsu without the mayo. She says that is good and leaves to go start making the Katsu, or so I thought. And just to be stated there was a group about to leave and another looking at the menu. We wait till after everyone else is almost done eating, roughely 15 to 20 minutes later, when someone else comes up to our table. We make sure that they got my order and they say that they didn't. So I then tell him my order again buffet he leaves before I get to say that I wouldn't like mayo. He still doesn't have the cooks start to make my meal. Sooner after he comes back to the tables, roughely 5 minutes later, and he asks to make sure he has the right order, now he stays for the whole order. He then leaves, now starting to make my meal. Now my sister starts eating a few peanut butter crackers because her salad was not much food and she accidentally drops one on the ground, they  don't offer to help but instead stand at the counter and  laugh at her. When about 10 more minutes till the Katsu finally gets to the table. It doesn't even taste that good and is all ready cold. So overall THIS PLACR IS MUCH OVER RATED!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings, they are spicy but not painful; I want to try more items next time I'm near!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was okay. I ordered the half&half lunch wing combo special or so I thought. I was given a mix of wings and drummettes. Go figure?  The spicy flavor trumped soy& garlic, plus preferred the wing meat.  For my side I enjoyed the thick skinned French fries.  Lunch was good going down, but felt slightly ill afterwards.  Could have been all the spices or related to the strange smell of the place. Glad to see this was observed by another reviewer, plus does not help matters as it is  located next to a pet salon.... Toss up if I repeat visit."}
{"text":"This chicken is like crack. It's indescribably delicious. I had a garlic soy drums, and the outside was so crispy.  I cannot wait to go back here and eat that chicken again. The atmosphere was fine too. Cute place. That chicken though."}
{"text":"I've never had Korean Fried Chicken but oh my goodness this is the crispiest, most delicious, flavorful, juicy chicken. At this visit I ordered the 10 piece chicken strips in the soy garlic and it was plenty to share with my boyfriend. We were both absolutely stuffed. We ordered it as take out and only waited 5 minutes and they have a nice waiting area.   I saw they have lunch specials mon-fri that are awesome deals and tons of food. Will definitely consider this since I work so close to this location."}
{"text":"First time here ...  trying 3 different menu items that I can't even pronounce!  Pics to follow....  heard lots of good things !  Appetizer was a fried shrimp thing called Shrimp Shumai . It was delicious!  I got a beef platter called Bulgogi. Thin small pieces of Ribeye steak with veggies and sauce .   Hubs got a beef bowl of Japchae. Glass noodles with beef and veggies .   It was all delicious.  A bit pricey but it was worth it !  The owner sent over some free chicken wings .... one was soy garlic flavored... semi sweet the other was spicy ... make sure you have water near ! It will light up your life !  Two thumbs way up !"}
{"text":"Food was ok chicken was a little dry and service was awful. Waited 20 minutes to order, staff at this location seems clueless."}
{"text":"Server was attentive, food came out promptly. Spicy was decently apocy, put a tingle in my mouth. Did strips, fries and pot stickers.  Not as crispy as I would have expected for Korean fried chicken but not bad. Would come back."}
{"text":"Ordered a small half and half wing, the pork buns, and the bibimbap. I really wanted to like the wings because that's what they're known for, but there was very little meat, too much breading, and not enough sauce. I would definitely order the other 2 items again though."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast. I ordered food online, and I was able to pick it up in less than 15 minutes. They seemed to be closing a little bit early, but the kitchen was still open. I highly recommend the Pork Buns!"}
{"text":"I met my cousin out here for a relaxed birthday dinner. From the service to the food, it was great. Our waitress was very helpful. When our food arrived it was fresh and steaming. The portions are so large. With my schedule, I love having great food to heat up later. I ordered the bulgogi and it was wonderful. The steak was tender, the vegetables cooked just right. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever! I had been dying to try this chicken since I've lived in Illinois. So many people mukbang this place and it always appealed to me. I ordered the food through yelp and it came right on time. The food was hot and so flavorful. BF got the soy garlic & I tried the 1/2 Spicy & soy garlic. If you're sensitive to hear, please don't order the spicy.  It's banging! The radish is a must for the palette. Onion rings are huge and you get A LOT. So happy to have finally got a chance to try this place. I honestly think this is going to be my fave place to eat"}
{"text":"Oh my my my! This makes me want to slap my momma good! We came in on the recommendation of someone. When we came in they offered us a sample to help us determine if we like it! Nice touch. The potstickers were great! The chicken strips are absolutely amazing!!! You gotta try this joint."}
{"text":"The chicken that  I had  was fried crispy with the soy garlic was very very good! Now the pork belly on the other hand was not good it looks good but it was not good I had way better.... my fiance had to Simon on a bed of salad they give you a whole lot of salad but she did love to Simon.. my baby she's very picky about her food she had a fried rice with calamari and shrimp and she ate it all and this was a big helping!"}
{"text":"Never had Korean style fried chicken before. We ordered a combo chicken with half and half spice. The wings definitely have better flavor as the drums were not very seasoned (if at all) besides the batter on the outside. The lunch portion was very big. We also ordered the japchae. It was well seasoned and tasty but very little bulgogi which was disappointing. Lastly, we ordered a spicy mayo to go with the fries but it wasn't in our to go bag. We were charged for it, so make sure you check your takeout before leaving."}
{"text":"Service at this location is much better than the Park Rd location. Located where the late, great Cluckers used to be. Food excellent."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious Korean BBQ Chicken Wings the way it was meant to be, huge, meaty, crispy and delicious!! Yummy! We ordered the half & half combo, jap chae noodles, house fried rice, and bulgogi tacos.  Everything was excellent' I'm definitely coming back and making this a regular spot. So glad Charlotte finally has a Korean  place so close to me!"}
{"text":"Very good Korean fried chicken. Prefer the soy garlic to the spicy version, but both are crispy & flavorful. Lunch special comes with a side. (Had the fries & there was a ton!) Worth the try."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and decided to eat inside the the place. I ordered seafood fried rice and it was so delicious They were super generous with seafood unlike other places where you get all but just rice and like 2 or 3 shrimps Lol .The place was clean and staff was very friendly. I'm coming back and trying there famous fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The best Asian food ever!!! I kept hearing my friend rave about it and we finally hit that little spot up. It was such a great lunch spot. Oh and they have a bar as well....huge plus. I need to get back there to sample the drinks. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful. Chicken was so good I actually cleaned my bones and was sucking my fingers(so not classy) but a napkin just wouldn't do. So needless to say I'll be back...again and again and  again."}
{"text":"The Jaechon was delicious! This is a much hipper spot than I expected for the location and they had good Wednesday night beer specials."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how the inside looked compared to my expectations. It's really really nice. Nice bar. TV's on a few walls. And outside sitting. Started with the calamari which looked a lot like onion rings when placed on table. They were the most tender I've had and while I was disappointed that no sauces came with it they have a sauce built in. A little sweet. On to the chicken strips. Lunch menu gives you 8 nice size pieces of chicken and a side. I will say the chicken looked better then it tasted. The coating and the sauce had great taste and texture. But very over cooked and a little dried out.  I will return but not for the strips."}
{"text":"Favorite spot to get Korean fried chicken. Best flavor is spicy in my opinion. Chicken is crispy and is not dry at all. I was disappointed with the service when we last went. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took the waitress a solid 10 min before she even asked us for our drink orders. Then we were given the wrong order. Staff gave us extra food to make up for the error which was kind. Unsure why the service was so off when we were the only ones in store. Will order takeout next time."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try bonchon and my dreams finally came true!  The spicy was actually pretty spicy (it stacks up). The soy garlic was delicious and I was sad when I ran out . The radish was a great necessity because it helped to cut the oil of the fried chicken and rejuvenate my taste buds.  The takoyaki was very yummy.  I would recommend just getting a small size if you aren't starving, or getting a medium and an appetizer and splitting that between 2-3 people"}
{"text":"I ordered food at 2:15 for delivery at 4:00 and was told that it would be 10 minutes late due to them not being able to find a driver. I called again at 4:03 and they said that the driver was on the way. I called the restaurant back and they had no updates on the delivery and explained that grub hub was responsible. I got an email from the driver at 4:23 and I called her and asked her where she was. She proceeded to lie and said that she called me and had already left my location. I was standing outside since 4:07 and did not see her or receive a phone call. I never received my food and I won't be ordering from them again. They need to fix their wonky partnership with grub hub for deliveries because it's obviously not working."}
{"text":"Service was a little awkward at first, but coulda just been us.  But these chickens...woah.  I hadn't had chicken that delicious in ever. We found it by accident but its definitely somewhere we will go again if we can"}
{"text":"Very nice looking restaurant.  Has a spacious bar and a patio off to the side.  I came in after lunch around 230. There were two other tables and a couple of people at the bar.  There was a hostess on duty and I was greeted and seated quickly.  My waitress was very nice and patiently answered my many questions. I ordered the lunch special chicken strips with half hot and spicy and half garlic and soy and a side of french fries.   My food came quickly.   My first impression was \"wow this is a lot of food.\"  And it was. I ended up taking about half of it home with me.  The food was very good.  Although I ordered the regular french fries, which are one of the side options with the lunch special. I actually got the Parmesan seasoned fries and they were excellent.  Nice and crisp with just the right amount of seasoning.   The chicken strips were good but I found the flavor of the soy, garlic and spicy hot to be overpowering.  Next time I'm going to ask if I can get them without the sauce.  Overall great.  I look forward to visiting again and trying one of their interesting looking appetizers."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see Bonchon with a group of restaurants Yelp wanted to see if I'd review. I would have thought I wrote a review immediately after eating. The chicken is double fried and extra crispy. The half and half meal gives you the best of everything - both wings and legs, half spicy Korean/half fermented Korean. I swap one spicy one funky to keep from getting over heated by the spice. It's a good system. Food is amazing, and the crispiness is out of control. I'd definitely recommend this place, and I see that it's a chain, so I'm trying to find another one to visit on my travels..."}
{"text":"Had mixed feelings about this place. But their bulgogi tacos and fried chicken changed my mind right away. It was really crispy, as it should be, and the sauce was great. They weren't joking when they said SPICY. My father had the glass noodle dish with vegetables. I didn't like it personally because of the sesame oil but if that's your thing, go ahead. Service was great, restaurant was clean, recommend to anyone looking for some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"I heard about BonChon on the radio and I'm sure glad I did. It's tucked away in a huge shopping center so if you don't see it at first, don't lose hope.   Food: Outstanding! I ordered the chicken tenders. Half spicy and half Asian garlic (I think). The spicy is no joke. Different from a buffalo type spicy, this is like eating sweet fire. It burns but it burns so good. The garlic was the perfect remedy for the spicy. I would absolutely get this again! My wife got the bulgogi and loved it. Hefty portions and delicious tender meat. I will mention she grew up (until she was 9 years old) in Korea so the fact she loved her dish is saying something! Lastly, the potstickers as an appetizer were perfectly cooked and not soggy like some places.   Service: This is what put it over the top for me. Dining with a newborn can be tricky but they were more than accommodating. Our waiter was fantastic. I'm not too critical of service but it's rare when I'm this surprised how well the service was!   To be honest I debated on rating it 4 stars only because it was a little pricey but the exceptional service made up for it. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my wife and 3yo. First time, so we got an assortment.  Started with wings, Garlic was really tasty and the spicy was flavorful though almost a bit too spicy for me (I can normally eat buffalo without a thought). The chicken was fresh hot and crispy. Yum! The bulgogi Korean tacos were very tasty and the bipimbap (with spicy chicken) was good but we thought the beef would have been better.   In all the food was tasty and the service good.  The restaurant was loud even only half full, and was difficult to hold a conversation sitting across from my wife.  Could use some sound dampening in there."}
{"text":"Korean restaurants seem to be popping up in a lot of places, so I wanted to give it a whirl.  My friend, Randy, and I saw this restaurant when we ate at a nearby restaurant a few weeks ago. We agreed to meet there for our monthly lunch gathering.  First impression was great.  The atmosphere is alluring, with an impressive array of visual stimuli.  Loved the red color scheme. It was quiet enough to enjoy a good conversation.   Unfortunately, the food was just not my favorite. The fried chicken strips were so chewy that I couldn't finish it. The kimichi cold slaw was good for the first few bites, but I couldn't finish it either.   The iced tea tasted like instant tea, not freshly brewed.   Finally, we noticed the Sanitation Score was a 90.5.  This is clearly below the standard that is acceptable to me.    I am glad that I experienced this restaurant, but I will not return, unless Randy insists, and I don't think he will."}
{"text":"So I go by this place everyday because I live within a couple blocks. After reading many excellent reviews I have to agree that the food here is just so good! I loved the pork buns. The bun is a soft spongy round, sorta sweet bun, with a strip of perfectly seasoned and lightly fried pork belly Accompanied by something like coleslaw and a pickle? I think that was?! I will order those again. The beef Korean tacos were delicious, but a little messy, so make sure you're not wearing your favorite dry clean only shirt. Edamame was perfectly steamed... But I think it could use a little more salt. The pork potstickers will definitely make you want to order them again. If you get the spicy... Be advised is the type of Spicey hot that makes your tongue feel like it's on fire... Even my lips  were burning, but its a good burn.. And you'll probably crave more of them as you eat."}
{"text":"Tried both flavored chicken wings both are good but prefer the spicy chicken. Great crispness and flavor but not a traditional buffalo wing this is a fry chicken in sauce. The fries were average."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago. Just to check this place out and compare to the Woodlawn location.    1. The decor is a lot nicer than the one in Woodlawn. 4 stars  2. The food is not as good as the Woodlawn location. 3 stars. I ate the fried chicken. And tasted like it was deep fried too long. Very very crispy batter. Although the meat and nice and juicy.   If I'm going for the food. I rather go to the Woodlawn location more in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was so expecting to like it after hearing radio commercials for a month claiming how good their award winning chicken wings are.  Great service by Phoebe. Great looking restaurant with inside and patio seating.  Now the down side.  We started with fried calamari - batter was very thick and calamari very chewy.  Bland taste with no dipping sauces.  My son had popcorn chicken that looked like they just took everything from the bottom of the deep fryer and put it on a plate.  I had Chicken Katsu with again a very thick batter/coating.  I've had Chicken Katsu at many other Korean Restaurants around the country and Katsu traditionally has a very thin fried coating.  We might try again with just carry out for those 'award winning wings'"}
{"text":"First time visiting here as they just opened a few weeks ago. My coworker had spicy chicken wings and regular chicken wings and said they were very spicy, but very good. I had the jupchae lunch special, which is beef, mushrooms, onions and other spices with glass noodles. Excellent dish!  I left with my stomach swollen and my pants needing to be unbuttoned!!"}
{"text":"I wandered into Pineville on a quiet Friday night. My date and I were seated quickly. We ordered the fried chicken ( half & half to try both flavors) and the korean tacos. I'm usually a picky eater so Im always removing something from a dish, but I felt adventurous. I didn't remove the slaw from the tacos. No regrets! The tacos are good and one of the lower calorie items on the menu.  The chicken strips come with a side of radish. We ordered an additional side of rice. The chicken strips are tender and delicious! Be careful: the spicy  chicken is spicy! The only downside is that you cant get extra sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Used to love their chicken and decided to try this location. Was not impress at all. Got the spicy wings for lunch. The wings barely had any sauce, maybe a little drip of sauce per wings on one side of the wing. Very stingy with their sauce. And the chicken was very dry also."}
{"text":"Awesome service! My food was served quick, hot and delicious. What more can I ask for.  The wings are out of this world.  I love the soy garlic wings they are so juicy and crispy! The crispiness of the wings is different than anything I have ever had. I just love them! The Salmon Avocado Ball is awesome. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm happy that they opened this location. The food here is good. I've eaten here as well as gotten take out. Their fried chicken is so good. We like to get the spicy kind. The chicken is crispy and not soggy at all. Even if you microwave it, it's still crispy! I always get a side of white rice with it. I did get a side order of kimchi and it was just ok. I could do without it. My husband got the japchae and he thought it was ok. We have also tried the chicken rice cake and it's definitely not worth $14. There was hardly any rice cakes in it and I just didn't like that they put cheese on it. It does not go together. But definitely 4 stars for the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while I was getting my oil changed at speedy. Ordered the prime rib tacos which were great. It's a new place and the chef wanted feedback on his wings, and I'm very glad he did. I'll be getting my football wings from here for certain. Service was great too, got done with my meal just in time to pick up my car."}
{"text":"The chicken is superb!  I had the half an half wing special for lunch.  Loved both the spicy and the sweet.    I've eaten A LOT of wings and these are a top 3 for sure.  The crispiness is fantastic."}
{"text":"Thank God my flight back home was delayed. If it wasn't delayed, I would have never came here and tried this delicious friend chicken! Fried chicken is my guilty pleasure. My secret affair. My hidden soulmate. The flavor and spice was perfect. The soy flavor was not so much. The crunchiness in each bite made the fried chicken all that much better. My little cousins got the popcorn chicken and my uncle got the clear noodles. Some spicy fried dumplings and a bowl of the bimbimbap. We had a bit of everything and we were all pleased. Coming back to this franchise soon!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and I wasn't totally let down, although also not as good as I was expecting. Let me explain.   We came for lunch on a weekday, and only a few tables were filled. Service was average throughout. We decided to split the 10 piece wings (half spicy and half soy garlic) and the bibimbap with bulgogi (other choices are tofu and spicy chicken) amongst 2 people. The food came out pretty quickly. The fried chicken was very crispy, though more sauce/flavoring would help it out more. We were also given 4 drumsticks even though we ordered all wings. The bibimbap was a letdown, especially at almost $14. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was just a lot of white rice in a hot stone bowl topped with veggies that weren't especially outstanding. Not a large portion of meat either. So next time I'd stick with the fried chicken. I also wish the meal came with kimchi instead of requiring us to order it as a side item. The fried chicken does come with pickled radishes, which balance out the salty greasiness of the chicken nicely."}
{"text":"Food was great, and didn't disappoint.  Had the lunch combo with fries.  Food came out quick and was delicious.  The location is sort of hidden off the main rd, I hope that doesn't hurt the business as this one is much more convenient than the other location."}
{"text":"This place has the best Korean fried chicken in Charlotte, no question. Just incredible."}
{"text":"This place was really good. This was my first visit and I'm glad I went. I ordered the manager's special to try a little of everything. The wings are good. They're offered in garlic soy or spicy flavor and both flavors come with the special. I got fried rice as a side and it was seasoned really well and has a smokey flavor to it. I may try one of the entrees next time because I'm sure I'll be back. If you're in the area give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The food is great...when you actually receive it. We came there for lunch and asked to be seated outside. Mind you, there was no one outside and maybe three tables inside. We ordered our food quickly. I ordered the salmon avocado ball and my friend the japchae noodle bowl. It took the waitress 15 minutes to bring our waters and an additional 20 minutes to bring ONE entree out..yes ONE!! Then 10 minutes later the other entree comes out. No apology nothing....so I am giving them 3 stars to be nice because the food was good. But don't come there if you're hungry because it will be an hour before you get your food"}
{"text":"The whole experience at this location of Bonchon was disappointing. They have two entrances one for dine in which is the entrance next to Walmart and one for take out which is on the side where the Pet Salon is. The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. We came after the lunch rush so about 2pm and we were excited because we were avoiding the rush. Unfortunately we received the short end of the stick.   We ordered Bibimbop, Bulgogi Korean tacos, and half and half combo fried chicken. The service was slow and the food came out about 20 minutes after we ordered it. The chicken seemed to be over cooked and dry but we didn't want to reorder and have to wait another 20 minutes for the food. I probably would come back for the bulgogi tacos but to go.   So when we received our food the waiter told us he was leaving for the day and left the check on the table. Which was fine with us but he hovered until we filled out the receipt AND then stayed the whole time hanging out by the bar. So he really didn't leave just clocked out I guess. After we paid we did not receive any drink refills and I had to raise my hand for napkins. No one even cared that we were their only customers."}
{"text":"Bonchon is a fantastic addition to South Charlotte.  You have to seek it out, as its location is tucked away in a small shopping center.  It's by far the most exciting business in that little nook.  Now, what we went for - the food.  Crispy fried chicken strips with soy garlic glaze, yes please!  It's hard to venture out from these savory treats, once you try them.  My whole family loves them and it's great how you can order a 10, 20, or 30 piece strip box to go.  Cook some rice and a vegetables at home and dinner is served.  The interior is nice and clean, with a full bar.  The staff is friendly and service was good.  We will visit quite often, and hope South Charlotte and Pineville embraces this new establishment!"}
{"text":"I can not get enough of the Spicy Korean chicken. The flavor is so good. I also tried the house fried rice and fried shrimp and wasn't wowed but that chicken OMG! I have referred so many people to try it and no one has been disappointed. I usually order online for pickup and my order is always hot and ready."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious foods for reasonable prices.  We order the pork tacos, pork slider and avocado salmon ball. All met our expectations.   My favorite dish was the avocado salmon ball. It's a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The taste was spot-on.   For the price and convenient location, we'll go here over the best place for pork tacos (Seoul imo) all the time for a quick and casual dinner.    This would be a perfect place to eat family style and try a little bit of everything.  I will return and try more dishes! Can't wait to try the wings!  Cons: the 2 person high tops are too close together. It makes me very uncomfortable being so close to another table. There is no privacy.  Chairs need to have sliders on the bottom as they are currently very loud when you move a chair.  The tv screens really don't add anything to the decor... but if you want to watch the game, they have lots of tvs. Personally, I think they cheapen the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolute fire. Reminds me of California.  Does door dash. Reasonably priced and fills you up. Awesome for lunch.   Korean mexican fusion."}
{"text":"Excellent!   I went for lunch and got the half and half combo. Half spicy/half soy garlic and half wings/drums. Chicken was crispy and juicy. It's a different kind of coating than you might expect. Almost cracker like and I'm thinking it was panko.  That works well for me, but if you're expecting traditional coating you will be surprised and hopefully in a good way. Had no issues with service. My soda was refilled before it was empty and the food was brought out quickly and when hot. My side was kimchi and it was a good blend between crisp, spicy and refreshing. Next time I'll try the pickled radish and there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Korean fried chicken, pot stickers, japchae are all delicious! Staff is very friendly and service was good. I've also been to the Woodlawn location and the same goes for that location."}
{"text":"I've been to the bonchon in K-town NYC. This one is better. It is clean and inviting. Service was quick and friendly. The food is awesome. We shared the combo wings and did the sauces half and half. Both sauces are delicious and the wings are super-crispy. We also got takoyaki and japchae. Both were excellent. The lunch special prices are a steal. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The food great!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE. Hubby went to get wings they gave us legs. We ordered calamari bc we were taking it home they gave us potstickers....I was so upset that I couldn't even go back to complain. This was the second not good experience with this company."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bonchon Chicken! I found this place on Yelp of course. Personally, I couldn't figure out why it was so popular with \"Crispy\" chicken reviews, when the pictures to me made the chicken look kind of soggy. But I was quickly put in my place! This chicken is super crispy!!! The 1st time I went, I dined in. I ordered the Fried Calamari Shrimp Shumai, Lunch Signature Fried Chicken Soy Garlic Combo with Cole Slaw & Bulgogi.... yes... I ordered all of this... on lunch... by myself!!! Talk about over doing it!! But clearly I got a bit excited and had tons of leftovers for a couple days. I LOVED IT ALL!!! I wasn't sure what to expect with the Shumai. But it was more like some sort of shrimp mix, breaded and fried. Not much shrimp yet still delicious. Calamari is my go to appetizer to try, whenever I see it on a menu, I have to get it. It was pretty decent though I probably wouldn't order it again. The Bulgogi was basically Steak Fried rice... really delicious Steak Fried Rice. I've returned multiple times just to order this. But the Fried Chicken was the star and the price is VERY reasonable. 6 large pieces of chicken and a side for $9 isn't bad at all. I get Soy Garlic sauce because I am not a fan of spicy, so I can't speak on that. But the Soy Garlic is very good. Nice asian flavors and not messy at all. A bit sticky to the fingers but not bad. I have to limit myself to Bonchon because I would eat it every week. So good!"}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I was given old food or a messed up order, but my to-go order was disgusting! I ordered half and half wings and the chicken fried rice. None of it had flavor. The spicy wings had spice but no flavor. The sweet wings had flavor in spots. The rice had absolutely NO flavor. I totally wasted $23, won't finish my meal, and won't be back. I wasn't even given a fork or condiments."}
{"text":"The best KFC -- Korean Fried Chicken!  This is in our regular work-week lunch rotation, and for good reason. The wings are bangin'. They are double-fried, so the crunch factor is AMAZING and whatever seasoning/sauce they use is DE-LI-CIOUS. I think they season it, fry it, dip it in sauce, then fry it again... whatever the process is, they do it right!  I normally do the wings lunch combo with half spicy/half soy garlic. The wings are HUGE, and the wings combo is actually half wings, half drums (not a big deal to me, but I saw someone complain about that, so I guess I'll point it out). Be forewarned that their spicy wings are actually quite spicy, and it's a different heat than standard American hot wings. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it is not a \"sour\" spiciness like tabasco. It is more like a chili pepper burn, I guess... but it hurts so good.  I haven't really tried much else, only because I can't bring myself to come here and not order wings. I have tried the japchae (glass noodles), which was pretty good if you are looking for a noodle stir-fry option. They use a lot of sesame oil in the japchae, so if that's not your thing, I'd pass on that. I have been meaning to try their bibimbap, but I always end up getting the wings (lol)... I have been told the bulgogi is too sweet, but I have not tried that yet, either.  In terms of appetizers, I liked the calamari. It doesn't taste like your typical calamari, though, because I think they deep-fry it in the same oil as the chicken wings; still tasty, but it's something to point out. Don't waste your time on the takoyaki, though. That was a total disappointment, even though the presentation was cool.  I wouldn't recommend doing take-out from here, as the wings lose their crunch when they are freshly fried and then stuffed into a to-go box (the steam will make the outside mushy/chewy instead of crunchy). If you are going to bring them home to eat (or if you have leftovers), take the time to put them in the toaster oven or convection oven--trust me--otherwise you are going to totally miss out on what makes Bonchon so great.  I saw some people complained about the service. Honestly, the service is just OK, but the chicken is so good, who cares?"}
