{"text":"I must say thank you for it down pouring this afternoon. I ran into the closest place I saw and it just happened to be the Wooden Vine. They had a very welcoming staff which encouraged me to sit down and dry off for a minute. After looking at there wine and food menu I decided to stay a while. The staff helped me choose a wine that paired perfectly with my cheese and charcuterie plate! Very impressed and can't believe I haven't ran into it before. I will definitely be back with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Save your time and money. Very unimpressed with the unprofessionalism shown by one of your male staff members.  We will never be returning to this establishment after quite honestly one of the worst customer service expieriences I have ever encountered (short haired curly dirty blonde and heavy set male with glasses).  We will not be returning. Absolute waste of money and time."}
{"text":"And an update :  I was told last time 2 months ago that literally my favorite wine on their list was going to be deleted cause it wasn't selling to well but I was so happy to see on my recent visit that the AN/2 which is the CALLET Grape from Mallorca Spain although $15 a glass is Worth every dollar. It tastes like crushed raspberries and even though the AC Was Down and Kitchen closed I hope they never delete that wine or I will buy a Couple cases just for me and tell them to save it for when I am in town. Try it with Serrano Jamon and a nice not too sharp cheese  and you won't think you are in charlotte but rather in Mallorca in Spain"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Good food and nice atmosphere. Sommelier choice of wine was phenomenal!!  The staff very pleasant."}
{"text":"It was like hanging out in a super awkward tree house ....Server messed up our order several times....I will not miss this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a quick bite for dinner before a performance across the street at Blumenthal.  We didn't plan on spending too much, but wanted something cleaner than tavern/bar food.  We've been to Wooden Vine before for after-work drinks and lunch, so decided to check the dinner menu.  I was happy to see some burgers, and my friend crab cakes.  The prices were reasonable, and we decided to head in.  The first surprise came when we were told that the menu posted on the door was the lunch menu, and not the dinner menu, and that they simply forgot to flip it over.  This meant that the burgers weren't there (no big deal) and the price for crab cakes changed from $15 to $28.  My fault for not noticing.  We decided to stay as time was short, and we both really like crab cakes.  The manager apologized for the confusion and offered to serve us the lunch portion, forewarned that the lunch portion is not large enough for splitting.  We declined the offer and decided on splitting the dinner portion.  As an appetizer, we ordered the caprese salad which was good, but small for the price.  The mozzarella was homemade and decent.    We also ordered bread (charged at $5).  The small, croissant sized, sliced roll arrived.  At first bite my friend said \"this is dry and tastes stale\".  I had a piece and agreed, but moved on.  Soon thereafter, the entree arrived.  Holy disappointment.  We're talking two, 4\" diameter cakes,  each of which could be consumed in two bites.  The cakes were presented on a portion of cold couscous and accompanied by 4 stalks of grilled asparagus.  At this point we're amazed.  How can a restaurant charge $28 for the entree we just ate?  How can a restaurant charge $5 for bread, especially when it was hard as a rock?    When the server returned, I demonstrated how hard the last two portions of the bread were.  I actually bounced a section on the table and asked the server to feel how hard the bread is.  The server did not apologize nor acknowledge how hard the bread was.  She truly couldn't be bothered.  I thought it couldn't get worse...  It did.  The real slap in the face, and the reason I wrote this review, is that they gave us a $3 discount on the $5 bread.  This stated to me \"we truly don't care if you come back.\"  When the bill was presented, the discount wasn't explained and NO apology was given.    Here's a script you can use in the future:  \"Sir, I'm sorry you felt the bread was dry.  I think you received a bad loaf.  As a note of good faith, I have removed the charge for the bread.\"  NOPE!  $3 off a $5 order of bread!  I'm still blown away!  Total was $63 - oh sorry, $60, including a diet coke and a cocktail.  Please appreciate your guests.  There's many places to go uptown before a show.  We will never go back; we will never recommend.  ---  Reply to the owner:  You guys are incredible.  I did not slam the bread. I bounced it. Crumbs did not go anywhere near the server. That's a blatant lie. You are effectively accusing me of assault.  Second, eating 95% of the bread? I ate 3 pieces of it. The last two (heel and section) were what I didn't eat. The entire loaf was dry, but the end pieces were edible. I'm amazed that you're trying to defend yourself.  You should reconsider your response. It is quite sad. You come across as a restaurant who will admit no wrong. You've done nothing but sound defensive instead of taking responsibility for a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The service was terrible. The waitress was acting like she didn't want to be there. The least a server can do is refill your glass once you have drank all the water and have eaten all the ice. She still got her 20% tip because of gratuity."}
{"text":"We went there to eat and have a glass of wine.  We were first seated at a couch with a table too small for 5 meals.  When we asked to be moved to a regular table it was obvious they were displeased with us.  (there were several open tables)  We only got one menu for the 5 of us.  We asked if they had more menus and they brought us only one more.  It was very hard to read the tiny print in the dim lighting.   The waiter was nice when he came by, but that was far too infrequent.  Horrible service!  They only brought out food for 4 of us.  When they finally noticed the error they offered to comp her meal and give us a free dessert.  After waiting a very long time for the check we asked about the dessert.  When the waiter finally came back he said the dessert would be several more minutes and asked if we would like to wait. We couldn't wait any longer and left.  The drinks and meals very expensive and very tiny portions.  3 shrimp with 2 one inch squares of hard grits and a tablespoon of purple cabbage for 28$!!!  We went to another establishment afterwards where we got 3 drinks for the price of 1 of the Woden Vine drinks.  And we learned that the place has absentee owners and has a lot of turn over in employees."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here on a Friday night to start our date night. The decor is lovely and the staff is knowledgeable about the wine. Unfortunately, they are not fluent in customer service or being friendly. We sat at the bar and had to interrupt a personal conversation between the bartenders to order our drinks. While sipping on our wine and waiting for our cheese board we tried to have a small conversation with the owner, who wasn't really doing anything but watching espn, he was brisk and slightly rude. The bartender was not much better. The cheese plate is fantastic and the wine selection is lovely. It is a great place to go if you want to be left alone, but not a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably the best wine bar I have found east of California.  It was an awesome environment with great prices.  The wine knowledge was unlike anywhere else and I flabbergasted by the customer service.  Completely non-pretentious and 100% welcoming.  Bethany (owner) represents everything good about American \"opportunity.\"  So happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Where I shall I start.. What was available on the menu, that was the question? From the wine to the fish EVERYTHING was out. Don't get me started on the waitress, Nadezda.. Without introducing herself she promptly told our group that they don't split checks, she wasn't attentive, she didn't offer dessert... And I wanted dessert. Great crowd? Nope, we were one of only 3 parties in the entire place but we still had bad service. After a huge check debacle, late food coming out when drinks were finished and the restaurant declining prepaid store gift cards.. We went to validate our parking ticket which they said was validated and when we got to the parking meter it was not and that was an extra cost to our already miserable night (icing on the cake that we weren't even offered). So thanks so much, Nadezda... Keep up the good work, NOT."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend, who had been salivating over the menu for months. We ordered dirty martinis that came out almost straight vodka, which was really disappointing. The pork belly - kopitas were okay. They had a sourness to them that I attributed to the apple. The duck quesadillas were a huge disappointment. The duck was way overcooked and the naan bread was almost burnt. Overall we gave it a 6 out of 10, and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Good wine, great service! Stopped in on a lazy Saturday afternoon, had a couple flights & enjoyed the rustic atmosphere. Service was great, offered us ability to charge phones, much appreciated as out-of-towners who forgot our battery pack!"}
{"text":"I found the Wooden Vine by accident while exploring uptown (we are new to Charlotte.) My husband and I stepped in on a whim on a Saturday evening, and what good luck that we did. I loved the atmosphere, the menu (both food and wine) and found all of the staff to be engaging and knowledgeable. The size of the venue is perfect. Not huge or small by any means, but just right. The decor is organic and the atmosphere soothing.We left very pleased and I made a mental note to return, asap!   So, I did.  On the last Saturday in April, I brought my book club here (around 10-14 women in total) to discuss the book of the month. Our server, Nina, was amazing! I had made the reservation in the days prior to our arrival and found management to be extremely accommodating. I have hosted groups of different sizes in restaurants before (in San Diego, where we just moved from) and found this to be by far the best experience.   Fourteen women on different checks? No problem. I spent several years working in fine dining and was amazed at how Nina didn't even break a sweat. Everyone was so well attended to, we were able to completely focus on our discussion. I don't remember anyone wanting for anything. On top of this, the ladies raved about the atmosphere, the service, and the wine list and food were impeccable. On top of having the best server, the most accommodating management, the rest of the staff seemed equally personable. Another server stopped by our table several times, genuinely interested in our book club and sharing some very interesting tips on what he'd been reading.   I shared a bottle of Cab with another lady (woo hoo!) and ordered the french soup dumplings- yep, I said it, dumplings! They were exquisite. The woman next to me had the cheese plate, and my friend ordered smoked tomato bisque. WOW. I've been dying for a legit foodie experience and I think I can safely say that we all walked away extremely satisfied.  The only complaint I have is that I don't live closer- otherwise I'd certainly be a regular. There is no doubt that I'll be back, with or without the book club!   Thank you, Wooden Vine, for an excellent and memorable evening!"}
{"text":"The service is perfect...for lack of a better word.  It is hard to find someone around who is NOT knowledgeable about wine.  Chef Nicholas is one of the best I have encountered in Charlotte.  His knowledge of food is beautiful and delicious.  It is quite unique so I encourage anyone looking for a quiet spot to enjoy this nugget of wonderful."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and found this place on Yelp. Great pour of Steelhead Pinot and awesome crab cakes! Be sure to check for the 10% coupon."}
{"text":"Decent prices, nice staff (mostly) and good atmosphere. Didn't try any food but intrigued enough to go back. Had a glass of sparkling rose and a companion had an unoaked Chardonnay and both were enjoyable."}
{"text":"Go here immediately.   The wines, cheeses & sandwiches are amazing...the staff is friendly and informative. Plus, the bathrooms are always clean - what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"So glad I stopped into this place while walking by last week. Great atmosphere, wonderful wine selection, and there wasn't a morsel of food left on my plate, it was so good. My sister and I could have sat there all night."}
{"text":"First time at a \"Wine Bar\".  Loved the décor of the place.  The server/bartender was very knowledgable and suggested wines based on our tastes.  Everything she suggested was wonderful!  Will go back next time we visit Charlotte"}
{"text":"Went here twice and ordered a pork sandwich, something I never get. It was truly exceptional and decent sized. I ate the second half the next day. The crock of olives and the cheese and cracker plate are well done. I can't say anything for the wine choices, as I only had a moscato. I suspect the owners hope to make their profit on the wine, since the glass was notably small. Yes, I know a sparkling wine perhaps should be served in a flute.  A solid and affordable place to eat.  The place seems to have a lot of anxious young men working the floor, but we got a warm and engaging foodie waitress the first time. She should get a raise for improving the ambiance."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love to stop here for a drink.  We like the atmosphere and the food is good too."}
{"text":"I went to Wooden Vine this past Saturday night with my husband and my parents. My parents were visiting us in Charlotte and I wanted to take them somewhere unique. I think we hit the nail on the head with that one.   The interior is very laid back. I loved the wooden scuplted tables....they added such a nice element to the dining experience. We ordered a bottle of wine to split and the boiled peanut hummus to start off with. The wine was a cabernet and excellent. The boiled peanut hummus was so good....my dad was even talking about it the next day!  Next, we ordered three small plates to share. We ordered the WTF chicken (the name was longer than that but I can't remember it....only the first 3 letters stood out haha), the Short and Corny, and some seafood bake. The Short and Corny was the favorite among all 4 of us. Delicious short ribs sitting on top of a creamed corn casserole........so good! The chicken was also very good and had this very tasty sauce over it. The seafood bake was good but didnt stand out like the other two items.   The only negative comment is that service is pretty slow here. They don't have many servers...sometimes it is just one person taking care of the whole restaurant. It didn't really bother us much because we were just drinking wine and chatting.   At the end of the night, all four of us were stuffed and left happy. We were still raving about the food the next day....so that means it's gotta be good!"}
{"text":"I definitely would NOT suggest going to this place for lunch. There was only one person working out front the whole time we were there. She brought menus and glasses of water to the table with no greeting whatsoever. I had to ask what the lunch special was that was advertised on the sidewalk. My friend got a chicken Caesar salad that had about 10 leaves and maybe 1/4 of a chicken breast. I had to wait to get my correct plate because the wrong one was brought out. It was the special which is a half sandwich and house salad. House salad was only lettuce and a tiny amount of dressing. (had to ask for 2nd dressing just to cover salad) Maybe with a little TLC, this place could become a good lunch spot, but definitely not worth visiting at this time.  Suggestion: walk across street to Rira sandwich/salad bar and get a salad with anything you want on it for only $7. WAY better value!!"}
{"text":"Great concept and great variety of wines and foods however its not managed very well. Very short staffed the last 7-10  visits but the atmosphere is great. Best advice- try mystery glass of wine being served in your choice of red or white. If you guess region and maker of wine, your glass is on the house. The best part is that you get to try the best of best wine for $10. Its a great bargain as what they pour is usually between $25-45 a bottle. I wish the staff was more friendly and attentive but i guess if it was, you would probably not get in the place. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, incredible staff. Plus decent prices for being right uptown. I would definitely recommend this place if you have not been. Try the octopus, enough said."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, very knowledgeable staff and food is good too. Every time we've been we walk out knowing something new about wine or trying a style we wouldn't have thought about before."}
{"text":"Love the place. Walked over on a Friday night after the opening of the Romare Bearden park. We decided to sit outside and watch the people because it was such great werather and Wooden Vine has the perfect little patio. We had a nice waitress, can't remember her name, she recommended some things on the menu that were really great. I had the General Tso's Quail that came atop some type of crispy rice. It was really really good, I ate everything. Two of my guests had the grilled cesar salad with scallops. These were no puney scallops (3) and they were cooked perfectly. We had Presecco, beer, wine and relaxed. Definitely a great place to hang out and unWINE. (Hahaha...corny) A must go!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly one of the most unique and best wine lists in Charlotte. The ingeniously crafted list includes wines from every corner of the globe including often underrepresented Balkan wines from Croatia and Slovenia. The exquisite decor and impeccably sourced food make visits here memorable and leave you longing for your next visit."}
{"text":"Service was bad.  We ordered two bottles of wine and had to ask multiple times for water.  Portions were too small and way overpriced.  Had to order sides of pasta and pita bread to avoid leaving hungry - they don't serve bread with the meal."}
{"text":"Such great wine and even better service. Knowledgeable staff means a better experience all togther. Thanks for making our trip to Charlotte a good one!"}
{"text":"Quiet Saturday in Charlotte. Stopped by this promising wine bar to enjoy a glass and small bite before heading to airport. Whenever I find a wine bar, I have high hopes. WoodenVine was a bit of a disappointment in many respects. Sarah, while not a sommelier was very helpful and passionate about wine selection but the owner was completely uninterested in the few patrons that were present and the other bar staff was short, unwelcoming and had a bit of a scowl. The wine was just okay and there are only three items on the menu during the day (a cheese plate, a charcuterie plate and popcorn. So for my party of one I paid $36 for a meat and cheese mix because they are only sold separately without exception.   Pros Sarah did accommodate a flight of wine on a non flight day (flights are Tuesday only). Decor is fitting with upscale wine bars  Cons Unprofessional owners who walked around puttering about without so much as a smile or acknowledgment of customers. Staff not well trained or managed.  Wine selection is a B-  With so many other options is Charlotte for good wine and cocktails, I couldn't recommend WoodenVine : ("}
{"text":"great place to spend a few hours drinking wine and getting some good eats.. Good service as well!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a sassy wait staff, perhaps it's the Jersey in me that loves to banter. Went here on a whim with my husband as we were trying to soak in the thralls of uptown and landed on this spot. Tuesday night's they typical have $5 wine flights. The educate you on the different flavors of the wines, the origins, how it was barreled while you nibble on amazing appetizers. The have both our door seating and a bar area along with a formal restaurant. A bit pricey for my taste, but for apps and good conversation this is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"A fellow foodie and I had intended to go to Malabar for dinner, but it was closed for renovation or some such thing.  She suggested that we go to the Wooden Vine.   We were greeted and promptly told to find a table that we liked.  This was around April 24th, 2012 or so.  The waitress explained the menu for that night and about the wine flight system (highly recommended - the wine list is excellent, and the flight of three wines for $12 was well worth the price) and the specials that were available.   The restaurant is cozy - lots of wood, chalkboards in the paneling,  Very nice.  Romantic but also somewhat laid back, very subtle lighting.  It is a comfortable space and one that I enjoyed dining in.  Foodwise we started out with the cheese plate, roasted olives, and the grilled romaine Caesar.   A good charcuterie or cheese plate is one of those things I just crave.  The cheese plate here was a disappointment.  Three cheeses - decent portions- but, we were given 7 smallish crackers (smaller than a triscuit) and the cheese with some dried fruit and some sort of preserve that was smeared on the plate. That was it. When we asked for more crackers (should have asked for bread) the waitress gave us a strange look, but brought them out.   The roasted olives were amazing. If you're an olive person - you must try them.  Herbs, lemon zest, and other things were in there - and they were served in olive oil.  Just delicious.  At our request, they waited to bring out the salad.  The grilled romaine Caesar was half a head of romaine that had been grilled and had a chunky style Caesar dressing on it that was exquisite. The grilled lettuce added a complex and complimentary flavor to their rendition of a Caesar dressing.  If they offer this as a menu option, you won't be disappointed.   For the main course - M had the scallops and I had the pork belly over a panzanella-esque style salad.    Both were good.  The scallops, however, won the contest.  Sweet, cooked perfectly, a delicious sauce.  Just amazing.   The pork belly was cooked perfectly and went well with the crunchy panzenalla-esque starch it was served with.  The chief problem was there was nothing on the plate to help offset the fat of the pork belly - it became incredibly rich far too quick with nothing really to compliment yet offset the richness. A surprising oversight.   For dessert we had the pineapple financier- it was a huge disappointment.  The portion was small (two small pieces of the cake itself, and a scoop of ice cream with garnish)  M and I each claimed one piece of cake and fought over the ice cream.  Neither of us finished the cake.  The comment made was, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"   I will probably venture back in to the Wooden Vine, but it isn't on the list of places that I have to visit again.   Three and a half stars."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy some quality time in Charlotte. I was there on a Tuesday night with a friend after dinner. Although we have very different wine taste we found quite a lot of options for each of us. Music is nice, very quiet. Employees are very friendly. I would recommend for a quiet night and quality time."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambiance paired with a unique wine selection topped off with knowledgeable engaging staff.  We tasted a wine that would never have crossed our palette otherwise. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, time for a confession. My original review was my first Yelp review ever. I loved the bar so much that I had to sign up and help it survive. I loved its idea, even though the initial opening left some rough edges. But the bad experiences continued. The food was slow, the menu short, and the hostess was once downright rude. I thought about updating my review with a more reasonable rating, but I didn't have the heart. I loved what Wooden Vine wanted to be and couldn't bring myself to admit that it was failing.  And now I don't have to. The management has changed, the food menu is expanded, the kitchen stays open later, the music is awesome (and, occasionally, live), the lights are a little brighter, and the decor is as interesting as ever. The bar has finally succeeded in expressing the ideal that it put forward last year. It took a while, but the end result is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were Uptown catching a show, walking back to our car, when we happened upon The Wooden Vine.  I was looking for a new place to have a small upcoming birthday gathering and, after peering in the window, The Wooden Vine looked like just the place.  It looked intimate, cozy, and a little classy.  Besides wine, it also offered appetizers for those in the party that might still be hungry after dinner.    We arrived for our small birthday gathering and stood near the bar, talking and having a great time.  I was very impressed with the decor, furniture, and ambiance of the wine bar.  The lighting was perfectly dimmed.  The carved wood bar and tables lent a unique, cozy feel.   It was even much nicer than I had remembered, just having peered inside the windows.    We went on a Tuesday night, and the bar was pretty slow, which was perfect for us.  We received fantastic, friendly service from our bartender and everyone got to sample different wines from their wine menu.  The prices were very reasonable, too.    All in all, it was a fantastic birthday experience and just what (if not a little more than) I was hoping.  Thanks, Wooden Vine!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Salad through dessert was fresh, well prepared, and amazing. Service was great and Chef came to greet us and ask how the food was. Top notch."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and have some fun.  Great wine, fabulous food and marvelous new friends.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As locals, this is our go to place for wine, nice people and great conversation.   They have great wine flights and the bourbon flight includes a nice small batch and Jefferson's Ocean aged. If you like a challenge, try their Mystery Wine pours.   Menu has a something for everyone and is always good. Try the lollipop wings!"}
{"text":"I've never left this place disappointed. Great place to order a flight and let time pass you by.  I bring my out of town wine lovers here. I have never had the food here which is why I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"The wooden Vine is far from a hidden gem. It's in plain sight on Tryon...only hidden by far more advanced restaurants that can keep a Chef. I've been twice (last time last Saturday 7/22) Charcuterie board is nothing special and the pasta sauces are far from fresh. And the music isn't that great, much to loud and alternative."}
{"text":"Fun visit in mid-afternoon on a Saturday.  Very relaxing atmosphere.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Tried the duck fat popcorn.  Awesome!  They should serve a dinner portion of this stuff.  Probably not healthy but it is yummy.  I should note that it has some mid-eastern spices in it so expect just a bit of a kick and a non-traditional taste.  We tried the $10 mystery wine.  Great choice.  They select a wine then if you can guess the grape and region it is free.   This is a no loose proposition.  Win you get your wine for free.  Lose and you get a nice glass of wine.  They stumped us both.  I should had guessed the red but I was ok at missing the white as it is a grape I had never tried.  Yet another reason to give it a shot."}
{"text":"We came out for restaurant week and it was in a word - awesome!  The food was fantastic and our server was on point and took very good care of us. She has a very impressive memory and was able to not only recite the full menu but provide a great description of the wines and food. In any case we will definitely be back, we have been looking for \"the right\" restaurant to bring guests, and....we've found it! :)"}
{"text":"Met a friend for a glass ( haha-bottle ) of wine. Weather perfect for sitting outside.  Only had wine and no food. EXCELLENT wine list. Definitely strays from the usual wine offerings. Great place to try something new."}
{"text":"If you're wearing one of those long wool coats and enjoy hitting on cute bartenders you'll enjoy this place. Even if you're from out of town and are with your girlfriend, you'll also like it.  I really know almost nothing about wine. My knowledge of wine is like a caveman's knowledge of Justin Bieber. Even so, I enjoyed the flight of random wines I tried. I think it was something like $9 for a flight of three wines. Not totally sure, but the prices were quite reasonable.  The long wood bar and wine imagery all over the place melded well together. Even though the space was large, it was quite cozy and warm.  If you want to impress your girlfriend I'd take her here. You don't even have to mention you found this place on Yelp!"}
{"text":"So this place is too cute.   Seriously, I love a good wine bar. After having walked by this place only about a million times on my way to/from lunch every day, I finally stopped in a couple weekends ago. And what do you know? Its just as charming on the inside as it appears to be from the outside.   My friend and I just wanted to stop in for a glass or two of wine, so we sidled up to the bar, and were instantly greeted by a friendly bartendress (or is she just a waitress? I don't know...she served me wine, and that's all I really care about).   In addition to having a pretty decent wine list (I've seen better, but then again...I've seen much worse), she was also not stingy on the pours, and was more than willing to let me taste a couple wines (free of charge!) before I settled on a lovely Shiraz...and then a Zinfandel :) Honestly, such a chill and welcoming environment...which is the perfect milieu in which wine should be enjoyed! A+, Wooden Vine.  My one criticism is that I'd love to see some wine flights on their menu...I feel like flights are a must-have for any legit wine bar. Otherwise, though, no complaints, and I can't wait to stop in again!!"}
{"text":"Initially, I want to compliment the decor. The romantic ambiance is braced with subtle lighting and the tables were made of natural wood. The interior is uniquely designed and truly fits the name.   Now on to the food! We ordered the Mussels, Flank Steak and Herbed Gnocchi. The gnocchi had the perfect texture and was filled with flavor! The mussels had a very subtle and light taste, but it was delicious. In my opinion, the flank steak was not unique like the other two dishes. It was cooked to perfection, but I expected to taste a distinctive flavor like I did with the gnocchi and mussels. I think the dishes are intended to complement their wine selection and thus, are relatively SMALL. Nonetheless, the meal was surprisingly filling and very yummy! =)"}
{"text":"Great laid back atmosphere but can also accompany you for a pre-party or post-party affair.  Ask for Dean.  He will take good care of you.  Many wine selections and various libations available.  Convenient location and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My neighborhood goto. I live uptown and wooden vine has the best wine selection in Charlotte. A unique mix with great blends, varietals and European ciders. I love the food too. The Greek salad is my favorite thing in the appetizer portion of the menu. Where the wooden vine shines with entrees is the pasta. I love the papperdelle with roasted fall vegetables. The entire service staff is fantastic too, I never choose my wine they choose for me."}
{"text":"I had a great solo dining experience here. There are tons of wines to choose from, including by the glass and flights. The bartenders were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable.   The menu wasn't exactly my thing - a bit more adventurous than I was feeling. But I had an awesome steak with leeks and potatoes and a great berry tart dessert.   Despite staying for awhile when it was rather crowded, I never felt rushed. The ambiance was great. Just the right level of lighting. Wooden, but polished and modern. Just small enough to feel intimate, but large enough to accommodate a crowd. It had a nice rustic, classy, not intimidating, upscale feel.  This was a great Charlotte dining experience and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"What a GREAT spot!!!! My husband & I went on a date night.  Server asked about my favorite wines & suggested a wine flight. DELICIOUS! I was so happy.  My husband is a beer guy. He asked about a beer & Server suggested a different one. My husband really enjoyed the beer when it came out.  Knowledgable Staff!! We ordered a cheese & meat try. Chef's Choice, which was based off of my wine. Perfection! The lighting could be a bit more. Difficult to see the menus. The effect is of a relaxing place & it was.  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting setting. Good small plates and wine selection.  We work up the street from here and stopped in for a late lunch. We also talked ourselves into a wine flight which was really good. It was a white wine flights because spring had sprung and I was in the mood for white wine. Very good.  It would be a pretty relaxing place for a date or meeting friends. Not overly noisy or loud - casual enough that you could drop in wearing jeans, but nice enough that you wouldn't feel out of place stopping in before a show at the Blumenthal in your best dress.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Five stars for atmosphere. I LOVED the inside of this restaurant. The wooden accents on the walls and the arrangement of the tables were perfect.   Our server was nice, very attentive, and didn't get cranky when my boyfriend decided to last-minute substitute his original drink order with something else.  I had the Brunn (one of the \"alternative whites,\" from Austria) and the Piquilo Pepper Bruschetta. Both were good, but nothing blew my mind. I do feel that the menu was probably a little overpriced. Nonetheless, it was a nice way to spend a couple hours, and if I lived in Charlotte, I'd definitely go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I had no expectations coming in here, and I'm glad I didn't. This place was terrible. After being seated I heard one of the waitresses mutter something blatantly racist about an African American couple. Something about how they don't tip or something. It was beyond ridiculous. It seemed like the place was little more than organized chaos. I didn't even get the wine I asked for. The food suxelled too! I think it has potential, but potential isn't enough for a dining experience. Only go here if you're racist and don't care about wine."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area but I haven't really spent much time in uptown in years. So I was happy to stumble on this gem last Sat night. Enjoyed a white wine flight (great value at only $12 and fun to try different varieties). My fellow diners and I split the cheese platter, quite yummy. I had the gnocchi- great gnocchi but the sauce was a bit bland-- and the shrimp fettuccine-perfectly peppery without being overbearing. Fellow diners had the pork which was melt-in-your-mouth good (and I don't really eat pork), the chicken tacos (they said they were good) and flank steak (the worst of our choices- very fatty and not much good meat). They ran out of the peach cobbler we ordered for dessert so they gave us a chocolate tartine on the house- and it was delicious! Adorable decor, reasonable prices, great atmosphere-- live music when we were there, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Nice little place to sip great wine and watch Charlotte walk-by. We have frequented many times both as a couple and with friends and enjoyed the food as very tasty and avant garde even if it was a little pricey (but, hey, it's not bar food!). They were offering a 2009 Spanish wine for $23/bottle that scored for us!  So, we were a little disappointed and bewlidered recently that food was not served between lunch and dinner.  When the owners discovered our concern, they were quick to reach out to us, apologize and to encourage us to return (which we will).  Apparantly, an employee was negligent in understanding the restaurant's midday food offerings and they assured us it has been remedied.    Therefore, we heartily recommend the Wooden Vine not only for their unique offerings in Uptown Charlotte, but also because the owners are engaged in the day-to-day operation of their business."}
{"text":"Avoid....Really not good.  Overpriced watered down cocktails, inefficient service.  Small plates were pathetic and overpriced."}
{"text":"My friend and I met there for a drink, catch-up and a light meal on a Thursday evening.  It was a very nice atmosphere, not very crowded.  The staff was pleasant enough, but I always have my antennas up when coming into places that would be considered higher quality.  I am a supporter of places that cater to all patrons equally.  My initial thought was that it did not, but our waitress was very attentive and informative of the different wines in the flight we chose.  The spinach artichoke dip which was featured that night was not great, so I sent it back.  Our waitress did offer to replace it with something else.  The crab cakes were really good so my friend and I shared those.  All in all it was a nice space and I would go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I met friends for dinner and wine at Wooden Vine last night and we had the nicest time! I really had never even paid attention to the little spot next to The Dunhill. We noticed the decor right when we walked in which was very cool and welcoming. There was wood (surprise!) all around and it was very organic in shape and just fun to look at. At the bar they had a basket of discounted wine so you could buy a bottle to take home or to enjoy with friends in the restaurant. $20 bucks for a nice red. Can't beat that. We ordered lots of little plates and one of my favorites was the caprese salad. Its not easy to get such a juicy, red tomato this early in the season. Yum! Good place for little groups and they do have one large table if you want to go for a celebration. They even have a few bistro tables out front. Go for lunch or dinner today!"}
{"text":"Nice, cozy, intimate setting! It is classy meets rustic. It's a great place to bring a group of friends to visit. We could hear each other and didn't have to miss out on any part of conversation. No straining of ears or yelling...thanks!  They have some sandwiches and appetizer dishes that pair well with the vast assortment of wines. They offer $6 glasses of wines on Wednesdays.   If you are looking for wooden gifts (e.g., cheese board), this place has some unique things to choose from. If you have a purse or bag, you will be happy to know that there are notches made into the table. You don't have to worry about putting your stuff on the floor!"}
{"text":"A VERY well selected wine list makes Wooden Vine a nice place to have some wine while in Uptown. Their Somm (forgot his name) is very knowledgeable and will create a nice flight for you depending on your tastes.  To me, this is not a real \"foodie\" place but they do have small tapas plates that are quite tasty.  This is all about wine here....so that's why I go, especially before a show at the Blumenthal."}
{"text":"When you walk in the first thing you notice is the pleasant and attentive staff. The waiter was charismatic and not pushy about expensive wines during restaurant week. The decor is awesome-tables made of polished pieces of oak and giant wall art of what else?-grapes.   Racks of wine on the wall and varying hues of green and brown paint add to the understated charm of the place.  The food was bad ass. I do like green eggs and ham, yes I do like them Sam I am. Dr. Seuss lied. They are delicious. Go try them. Now. Just stop what you are doing and head over there.  Ok, on to the entrees. Braised bison tail and beer can Cornish game hen. To be clear, these are separate dishes.  Ummm, wow. The meat was tender and flavorful and the corn souffle that came with the beer can hen was one of the better side dishes I have ever encountered in my life. (my partner would not stop stealing it off my plate).  For me, going out to eat is a chance usually to eat things I can't make myself and experience something uniquely delicious. Our dessert was like this- lemon meringue pie that was deconstructed in a bowl with meringue \"sticks\". I felt like the entree portions were perfect while the appetizer and dessert could have been a little larger. However, the service was flawless and this was the type of place that made us linger of an extra glass of wine."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice dinner around 8:30PM in charlotte, NC. Aimed for \"Wooden Vine Bar\", basically walking  by selecting by instinct, and based on the looks of it. It is a very nice place. Had some great Bourgogne white wine. Dinner was fish of the day which was wonderfully prepared: It was a taste roller-coaster and just the right size. Nicole, the sweet and good looking bar tender was a great chat along with another couple at the bar. Nicole turned out to be a sommelier in training and knew more about wine that I could ever wish for. A pleasure to be at this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The plating and visual appeal is always on point. The food is always delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"The ambience and decor is very nice, and the service is great. Food is marginally better than average. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant for a great girls night, a first date or a couples night out. The vibe and comfort of this place will transcend all people who enter! I have a fear of gritty scallops and without a doubt, I had the best scallops I have ever tasted (grit Free!) here! My husband and I celebrated my 30th birthday here and had a wonderful, relaxing, enjoyable and delicious time. We even got surprised with a complimentary homemade lemon cake on the House, no joke this is the best place in uptown! You will not regret! And they have multiple level 2 Somms in the house which is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place on every trip to Charlotte and it just hasn't worked out for me. I am so glad that I stuck with it. There is so much to love about this groovy little niche bistro. On an oppressively hot June evening walked from the sidewalk into an inviting (if not a little dark) electro-jazz filled small bar area. The bar itself is very generous considering the overall size of the venue - 10 bar seats and 4 high tops. It really only took a few minutes to the lighting. The bartender, Michael,  offered light but not over indulging conversation and excellent wine selections. I started with the Beet and Goat Cheese salad paired with a lush Spanish rosé. For my entré I had the small plate of Braised Short Rib with house made goat cheese stuffed tortellini over lightly dressed arugula paired with and Eldorado Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The best salad could benefit from a lighter hand with the balsamic reduction, but if that is the only thing in which I can find fault I'd call this evening a big win. Business travelers and locals alike can find a welcome change from the ordinary at this little gem."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in the middle of downtown. Some good advice from the bar tender on wines, even let me taste some before buying. However, as a wine bar, I wish the menu by-the-glass was a little better. They only had about 20 choices in total between whites and reds. I didn't recognize but a couple on the list and wish there was more to grab my attention. Overall though, not bad. I would go again."}
{"text":"The music was phenomenal. So phenomenal, I bought the $2500 bottle of wine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Charlotte area. Especially for the music."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar area. I went twice in 3 weeks. The sommelier is very pleasant and listens to ensure you get the wine that fits your palate. I've also dealt with the female bar tender, she was nice but not very personable when I was the only one at the entire bar during a slow time of day. She also was having some private conversations with another staff member, which is fine, but not what I expected at a place I'd describe as a quaint family run wine bar. (Really not sure if its family run, but they do well at giving off the vibe.) Good for dates, but I think slightly overpriced for the value. Also, they don't carry Zinfandel, my favorite grape, which was also a bummer. Obviously I've been twice, so I like it, but I'm not opposed to find a better spot for good wine and service that wants to treat you like a regular."}
{"text":"LOVE the decor, the lighting was perfect and the live music not too loud. I felt $10 was a bit overpriced for the fondue dessert (although I admit I'm comparing to Melting Pot's chocolate fondues), but the wines were lovely and the staff was friendly without being intrusive. The rest of the menu looked good, so I'm hoping to go back and try some of the rest of the menu and give Wooden Vine a better rating."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible staff. Bar tender had an attitude problem and was incredibly unhelpful. We could see into the kitchen where the staff was goofing off, and totally uninterested in cooking the over-priced food on the menu.   This place used to be one of my favorite establishments, but unfortunately, it's gone down hill over the years."}
{"text":"Ok, don't get me started. We were persuaded to go here by a friend, when we got in it was as quiet as a tomb! Although there were several couples dining, they were as quiet as church mice!    We ordered, I must say, the lamb meatballs were quiet tasty and the honey figs were more than splendid.   It wasn't the food, but, the somber mood of the place. No one should take themselves this seriously. Pretentious. Snobby and for what?  Get over it and then decide to open a restaurant with a little warmth for folks spending their dollars.   And, for Gods sake----------get some catsup! It is the #1 condiment in the  U. S. You serve crispy potato wedges, c'mon already!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food:  crab cakes, duck quesadillas, gazpacho.  Beautiful dining area, great ambiance, warm and inviting, great wines, and even a decent selection of craft beers.  Wait staff pretty good, but not enthusiastic.  Music:  HORRIBLE!  They played all disco and 70s.  Bad Mamma Jamma, Get Down It.   Seriously??  This is a wine bistro.  Should be jazz, classical, or coffee house, like John Mayer, Jack Johnson, etc.  Change the music, and we will be regulars."}
{"text":"I totally fell in love with this place. Love the dark decor. Love the big wood plank of a bar that gave it a natural feel. Love the friendly and pleasant servers. Love the clientele. Just love the whole place.  We were only there for a quick drink. The girl taking care of us at the bar said that we could arrange our own flight of wines for $12. We both took advantage of the deal and tried any 3 red or white wines we wanted.   The feel of the place is just so welcoming to me. Perfect spot for a casual date or after work drinks. I could see myself spending a lot of time here!"}
{"text":"Nice bartender, good wine, mediocre food.  I got what was supposed to be their signature pasta, and the meat was really poor quality (lots of gristle)."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of wines, foods not to bad either. Haven't been here in a while since I moved to other side of town and miss coming here after work."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to spot in Charlotte, but since my first review in 2014, the chef has changed a few times. I went last night and was really disappointed in my meal. We had the calamari which was fine, but a bit on the salty side. it was served with a cajun dipping sauce which didn't have much flavor. The entrees all come in 2 size options on the current menu. I ordered the salmon & kale but wasn't asked which size option I wanted - I assumed the small was the lunch portion and the large was the dinner. When our food arrived, the server announced that it was the small portion. The salmon was roughly 3\" x 2\" in size and came with 2 pieces of kale. I ended up sending the fish back since the center was dark, wet and soft. The kale was so salty I coughed when I took a bite. My dining companion said it tasted like it was brined in salt water first.  I still think Wooden Vine has great ambiance, though the light classical background music it used to have is replaced by classic rock, and I'd go for a drink anytime, but perhaps skip dinner."}
{"text":"While walking around downtown Charlotte one Saturday evening, we stopped here for a glass of wine and a snack. They offer wine by the glass as well as by the bottle. They have a decent worldwide selection of wine. For a snack we had the hummus trio small plate. It had red pepper, garlic and lemon hummus which were all good. It came with wedges of pita bread. The red pepper humus was runny. My other complaint was that the pita portion was too small for the amount of humus. The shop was neat and the service friendly. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"They opened the bar just for us after a private party. We love this place. They were cleaning up after a private party but were very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"We made a reservation via Yelp for dinner at 6:30PM on a Friday & noted that my wife is a vegetarian. Since I have never used Yelp for reservations, I made a follow up phone call to the restaurant on Friday afternoon to confirm our reservation & remind them that we need a vegetarian entree. The response was no problem as we have them on our menu. We ordered the only vegetarian dinner entree on the menu & were told that were all out of it at 6:30PM?. How is this even possible unless they never prepared any of it that day? The waiter advised us their chef can make an alternative dish. We had previously ordered spinach dip & tomatoes as appetizers. When are entrees were served, the alternative vegetarian entree was spinach dip over a bed of rice. Redundant, bland & unacceptably poor quality! When asked how we liked our dinner, we expressed our disappointment & they agreed to remove the charge for this entree & subsequently discounted the bottle of wine by half. The appetizers were mediocre, we had to ask for water refills & to top it off they could not validate our parking, no explanation was given but they either couldn't operate the machine or it was broken.  While the discounts were helpful, they did not mitigate a deeply flawed dining experience. We noticed that most guest were not having dinner, just drinks & appetizers. Based on our experience this is a wise choice as this is definitely NOT a good place for dinner!"}
{"text":"Good wine list, good service, but very small portions, even for a tapas place. The portions are just tiny. The charcuterie plate was like 4 small slices of meat and the vegetable plate was four small beets and a couple pieces of lettuce. It's a cute place to go for a drink, but it's not a place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a week night. It wasn't anything spectacular. My wife got a wine flight and I got a bourbon flight, both were good I liked that they came with cards explaining flavors, histories etc. I wasn't a big fan of the service, and the prices were definitely way higher than usual for some simple flights, I think my bourbon flight only had one real craft bourbon on it. We got some light apps and they all were mediocre at best, the fries we had were soggy and greasy. All in all, there's a bunch of better restaurants nearby with extensive wine lists that are actually worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from California and asked around where the best place would be to eat. Several people told us to go to the Wooden Vine. Since several people recommended it, we decided to try it out. We could not have had a better time! The place is so unique over the other establishments in uptown. It is quaint and the wood decor is delightful! The wine list was impressive and the sommelier was gracious and explained each wine for us in our wine flight, which I highly recommend getting by the way. The menu was adventerous. We all tried different things so we could taste as much as possible. I got the lamb shank which was heavenly, the other things we tried were the venison short ribs and the pealla. All were were prepared and so good! We will be back tomorrow night as there are many more things we want to try before we leave! Thanks to all those who gave us this special recommendation!"}
{"text":"This is a great little upscale winebar/grill right in the hear of Uptown Charlotte. Its near the discovery place, The Dunhill hotel, and Capital Grille. Really great decor. Talk to the sommelier/owner..he has some great recommendations. and will have some unusual selections that you are guaranteed to enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to spend NYE in Charlotte, booking a room at the Marriot. We decided on The Wooden Vine to keep our dinner within walking distance, and we had previously attended the cooking competition \"Fire in the City\" which introduced us to The Wooden Vine's cuisine. Upon our arrival, we were seated at a rustic wooden table. Being NYE there was a set menu which included a bottle of white or red wine or a bottle of sparkling wine. We chose sparkling and checked out our options. I was happy that mussels were available as a starter and my husband selected the charcuterie. My mussels were delicious in a creamy broth. The charcuterie was just a few pieces of manchego cheese and crackers but when we asked if meat was included, our waiter, Andrew, brought forth another plate with prosciutto which we were happy about. After that, I was served butternut squash soup that was so rich and velvety it was practically pudding. My husband's beet salad looked great and he said it was yummy since I can't stand beets. Our entrees of scallops for him and wagyu skirt steak for me were very tasty but I was fading fast after all the rich food. Finally dessert, a crisp apple tart for me and creme brûlée for him. We had a wonderful dinner in a cool, rustic venue with great service. This was a perfect way to start off 2017!"}
{"text":"Updating my update.....  The owner is very nice and responded to my diatribe.  I guess it was a misunderstanding.  Wooden Vine will always be one of our favorite spots.     Previous review:  I am downgrading my review here from 5 stars.  It has nothing to do with the food - Chef Nicholas is fantastic and I hope the restaurant can hang on to him.  This will always be one of our favorite date spots due to attention to the menu and wine selection.  My downgrade just has to do with a recent experience - the boyfriend and I were there for Valentine's Day.  It was $150 per couple - the meal was divine.    The disappointing part came to the service - we brought with us an expensive bottle of wine ($70 bottle of wine which we knew they did not sell there) and there were no issues.  We knew they had a ten dollar corking fee.  HOWEVER we ordered a second bottle of wine and told the waiter \"our palettes are shot after this bottle - so something less expensive...definitely NOT another $70 bottle of wine.\"  So - we had that bottle and all is lovey-dovey for Valentines Day.    Until we get the bill.  The waiter had actually brought us a $69 bottle of wine.  He did not tell us prior to drinking it.  Of course we should have asked.  But really?  We say 'Not another $70 bottle of wine\"  and you bring us a $69 bottle of wine.  What on earth?  Is that supposed to be funny?    It really soured me on the place - which until then had been one of my favorites.  It will definitely be a while before we are back."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. And beautiful. And awesome. Our group escaped the madness of the \"Green Shirts\" (largest bar crawl ever) at the Wooden Vine. I was awestruck by the interior--beautiful carved wood tables and bars in their natural shape. Great wine list. Attentive and knowledgeable servers. Very eclectic, cozy, and relaxing. What a great place for a date!!! LADIES--their bathrooms were so clean you probably could have eaten food off the floor--not that I suggest that, but you get the idea. And wow--they did not skimp on decor or furnishings.  I had the Vina Do Val. Fantastic. Others had the Cab, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc. They didn't disappoint! I can't wait to go back to this little gem!!!"}
{"text":"We went for the drinks and got a smoked old fashioned and flight of wine. Both were excellent and we highly recommend for before or after dinner drinks. The tables are made of old elegant wood which creates a sophisticated atmosphere. We only wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying it was Restaurant Week - but regardless, my exeprience was not great.  The staff was nice and semi-attentive, but perhaps rushed and confused because there was a lot going on.    It felt like I was in the twilight zone when we walked inside.  The decor was lacking in my taste, though the whole restaurant is made of reclaimed wood which is awesome - it was ruined by the large photos of grapes everywhere, and the strange choice of different colored velour chairs.    To start, the silverware was dirty - greasy and stained.  Had to clean it myself.  For our appetizer, we had duck wings.  The duck wings were a soggy and greasy.  They fell off the bone and were tender which was a plus, but had zero flavor save the taste of grease and a touch of honey (think that was supposed to be tamarind).  Probabaly would have been better if there was some salt and pepper or something.  I had the seafood paella for my entree.   The crawfish was completely raw. The portion of the meal was the size of an appetizer and had only mussels - no squid or shrimp as advertised. The rice was a bit too al dente and did not look like a normal yellow rice should. I sent the plate back and the chef came out and apologized, kindly comp'ing my meal for my troubles - sitting and watching everyone eat while I was starving.   I did appreciate that he came out to do that.  But the second plate was still part raw and had an even smaller portion of rice, but at least one piece of squid.   Taste wise it wasn't bad.  My boyfriend had the venison which wasn't a total failure. The brussels sprouts were cooked well but doused in grease. The venison was tasty and had a nice texture - guess that is what the 1 star is for.  But the wine pairing was not very good - it tasted like a wine soaked in a metal casket.   By the time we reached dessert, we were just fed up.  The meal was not a pleasant experience. They were having freezer problems and brought us raspberry sorbet instead of Nutella, and the dark chocolate piece did not look very appetizing; it was a long limp brown log that was actually wet from condensation.  And it sat on top of a messy pile of chocolate cake crumbs, which was not very pleasing to the eye.  All I can say is maybe it's different when it's not Restaurant Week, but I was not too pleased to end a fun weekend in Charlotte with that."}
{"text":"I love myself a good meat/cheese board and WV does a fantastic job selecting really high-end cheeses and high quality meats. The plated food itself I find underwhelming so I personally always stick to a good meat and cheese board. They have a good selection of wines by the glass. The place itself is very low key and is suited for a nice glass of wine after work or a date ; -)"}
{"text":"I've been here only twice but enjoyed it so much that I wanted to review it even though I haven't had the food yet...both times have been with other girls to catch up over a few glasses of wine and it's the perfect spot for just that.  There is an amazing wine list that always has super deals, they have a good beer selection and the tapas menu looked yummy (friends had the crab and corn dip and the potatoes, said both were great).    The decor is cool as well with natural wood all over and local artwork...was there this past Saturday and they had live music - the place was full of couples at tables, so it's a great date place, but also just singles at the bar and few groups of girls too...if you like wine, I highly recommend it, it's a nice quaint spot in Uptown that's a refreshing change from the intensity of the Epicentre."}
{"text":"The wine was great and the space was really nice.  But my friend and I ordered a cheese and charcuterie plate and it was $25 so we were expecting something pretty nice. It was 2 small umimpressive sausages, 2 cheeses, Flatbread, and some random jelly. I know rent is expensive in downtown but this was a bit much.  Even Roosters, a very popular restaurant in downtown and Southpark isn't that pricey.  I mentioned it to the waitress when she brought it cause I was so shocked and she said nobody ever said anything...maybe they didn't want to appear cheap in front of a date or coworkers.  But overpriced is overpriced for subpar output.  The wines were very reasonable though."}
{"text":"I came here when my mom was in town and really enjoyed the evening. Awesome interior decor. We had a GREAT waiter who was charming and kept us luahging all evening. The wine he suggested for us was wonderful. The cheese plate left  a bit to be desired however the deconstructed caprease was really different and amazing."}
{"text":"I love the wine selection here, and the owner Bethany is such a doll!  There are so many wine flights to choose from, just pick the toe of wine you're in the mood for and go for it. Ive had the Gouda cheese board and it was very well put together. It came with the cheese ( of course), raspberries, crunchy bread, pickles veggies (which were very unique), and this house made chocolate/fudge(really gives you a rush of endorphins).   Unfortunately it's hard to tell when this place is actually open. One night I went with friends, and they were closing to the public early so we had to leave. Another night I wanted to bring my hubby for the amazing wine, and we discovered they were closed when we got there, and then two other times I wanted to go and didn't know they were closed until we got there. Its almost like they should post a calendar outside so you'll know when they're open. It was really disappointing and pushes me not to select this place even though the wine is so good, because how disappointing would it be to make plans to go here only to find they are closed to the public when you get there?  At least i know they are great for private events lol, maybe."}
{"text":"This is a really beautiful little spot on the north side of uptown. There is a large selection of wines and other spirits, along with tasty eats to enjoy inside or outside of the restaurant. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. My friend asked if there were any specials we should know about, (because most bars in uptown offer daily or weekly drink specials). The waiter told us know, but we were able to pull up a page on their site advertising 50% certain bottles of wine. While my friend went back to the site to retrieve the information to show him, he hovered over her shoulder watching her navigate, which was a rude and a bit creepy. When she found the page, instead of offering to honor the advertisement (which would have been the good customer service thing to do), he wanted to know how she found that page and stated \"we deactivated that page\". He gave us the impression that he thought we fabricated a fake page specifically to get half off a bottle of wine. The service wasn't terrible, but it did make my friends and I feel a unwelcome. We took our business down to the next block to Duckworth's where the menu was extensive, service was spectacular, and the drink specials were honored as advertised."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection and the food was incredible.  I had the duck which was exceptionaly tender for a gamey meat. The sauce was also delicious. I had a Chilean Bordeaux (Cuveée Del Maule) that was VERY good and paired well with the duck. Atmosphere welcoming and peaceful. Owner and staff down to earth and fun to talk to!"}
{"text":"Gave them another shot with same horrible result.  They we busy due to concert.  Sat at bar for 10 minutes with not even being acknowledged.  Once again walked out.  Understand busy times but that was ridiculous."}
{"text":"So....I'm not a regular, but feel like it when I show up...some updates......Tuesdays is 1/2 off bottles!  Wednesday is wine flight night for $12...3 bucks less than most!  Finally, Friday is live music!!!  This continues to be the go to place for a great bartender (Ben) and a great wine bar."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Bad wine selection. Bogus specials. If you're going to spend your money on wine. Their are several other places to drink wine."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend on a Monday and had a great time. It was half price bottle of wine night.  The waiter helped us pick out a decent bottle. We had several small plates to accompany it.  The waiter insisted we try the Duck quesadilla. We were hesitant but he said it was the best thing on the menu.  He was right.  It was more of a gourmet grilled panini. The manchego cheese was melted perfectly and combined nicely with the other ingredients.  We also tried the Fois Gras, which was rich and creamy. There was a pork belly special that was fantastic but the portion was extremely small. The Wild Boar lasagna  and the scallops were just okay.  I was disappointed by the KimChi lettuce wraps.  Overall, it was good service, nice atmosphere and the food items really were all over the board."}
{"text":"My special friend and I visited this restaurant on the first leg of an epic date that happened to coincide with the running of the Criterium bike race. We had no idea that we would have to cross the Criterium course four times in order to reach the Wooden Vine, but the dinner was indeed worth the risk of being clipped by a couple of cycles! (Incidentally, the bistro tables out front were full of spectators--this is a prime viewing spot for the bike race!)  We opted for the new Spring Chef's Tasting Menu--a seven-course gastronomic pleasure cruise that took us through two-thirds of the spring menu. Each course was lovingly served by the enthusiastic Chef Nicholas, who informed us that we were the first to try the tasting menu. Given the quality of the farm-to-table ingredients and the care in which they were prepared, I doubt we will be the last to take the plunge and be pleased.  My favorite was the pasta course--a stinging nettle-filled mini-ravioli that has a fancy name, but I didn't catch it. Mostly because I was controlling the urge to lick my plate clean of the verdant sauce covering each pillowy piece of pasta--pure heaven, y'all. Each plate featured some sort of spring flower garnish but this one totally stood out--atop the pile of saucy green goodness was a single, violently orange petal perfectly matching the chili oil dotting the plate. Someone loves vibrant colors and I love them for it!  I also enjoyed the cheese course--a creamy local fromage with a cocoa-nib rind served over buttery cornbread with apple butter and peach preserves. That would've been enough for dessert itself. That is, until the espresso cup of rich chocolate mousse arrived in the dessert course. So rich and smooth, it was tough to finish, but I'm no quitter, folks :-)  All in all, beautiful decor and food presentation came together in a feast for the senses. The only real shame is that we didn't try any wine during our visit--all the more reason to return and experience the new menu and the wine it was crafted to compliment.   Enjoy, folks, and keep eating (and drinking) local!"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying, this place used to be awesome. I suppose until it became under new management more recently. I used to go to the wooden vine all the time for wine and small bites after work, with friends, on the weekends at night, and my good friend who is extremely knowledgeable of wine used to be the manager here. Even since he's left I've continued to frequent the wooden vine and recommend it to people from all over, all the time. I work and live in uptown Charlotte and network with everyone I come across, even tourist that ask where they should go while they are in town- I used to send them here. Welp- not anymore!   I went in on New Years Eve to bring in the new year over a glass of Champagne with 5 friends...(by the way this is probably the 3rd new years eve in a row I've spent at the wooden vine). As I was handing the \"door man\" (we'll call him) my ID, it slipped out of my hand and hit the floor. I picked it up and proceeded to hand it to him. As a result of this incident he determined, solely from that, that I must be too drunk to be served and refused to give me a glass of champagne, about 4 or 5 minutes before the ball drop.   Fair enough right? I've worked in food & bev long enough to know that you most certainly can refuse to serve anyone at anytime if you feel they are too intoxicated. However, you need to at least come up with a legitimate and professional reason to do so, and you need to communicate that effectively.... directly to the person you are refusing to serve. In a very untactful and passive aggressive manner he told someone else in our group, that I was not being served. Pause. Hello- I'm right here, not in the third person, talk to me, what kind of establishment are we in after all? After that, a group of loud, twenty some year old college kids, (one guy and 5 girls) came gallivanting in shortly behind us and DIDN'T EVEN GET ID'd at the door because mister door man was so preoccupied with us. Because that makes a lot of sense considering all the trouble we were given over a \"dropped ID\", doesn't it?   ...What happened there on Thursday night was completely uncalled for and unnecessary thanks to the young, overzealous newbie manager who was on a serious power trip new years eve night. It honestly blew our minds.  I was in there just about a week or so prior to this incident and the same young man was clunking around in the wine racks clanking bottles and dropping things himself right behind the table we were sitting at, you didn't see any of us writing a bad review then about the manager at the wooden vine being a clumsy and sloppy wanna be sommelier- did you? No, because it's okay to have butter fingers from time to time.... Or is it? ....Guess not.   It's okay.... new year's eve must have just been too much for his nervous system to handle. Good luck keeping loyal customers that way.... I hope someone else cuts you a break next time. You'll just have to figure out how to make better judgment calls in the future.  That being said... The old management at Wooden Vine was the best thing that ever happened to this place, and the owners are super super nice as well.... because of this I am more than confident that they will soon get their act better together, but I won't be around to find out."}
{"text":"Can not believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars!?  Stopped in last night because it was a casual place to have a glass of wine next to my hotel.  Boy am I glad I did.  For wine and tappas I went with the recommendation of the bar tender Ron!  If he is working definitely take him up on his suggestions on the menu, you won't be steered wrong.  He really makes the place shine.  Will be back next time I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Wine and mixed drinks were good. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We went here when it first opened & liked that all the wood was made by the owner's brother.  I don't know if it's the same owner, but they should have someone come in & fix that big split in the bar.    The have a couple of tables outside the door, but it's much nicer inside.  There are nice areas to tuck into with a couple of people or a larger group.  The bar area is good & the bartender is knowledgeable and helpful & makes sure to mention their special events.   This is a nice place to meet up after work & have some small bites and a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Great tapas restaurant. My wife and I tried a few different plates and all were superb. We started out with the Dip Duo as an appetizer and really liked the olive oil they used.  For our entrees we ordered the scallops and yellow fin tuna.  Each were uniquely prepared and cooked just right. We weren't sure how big the plates were going to be so we also ordered the cast iron Mac and cheese - which was spot on.  The turtle S'more brownie dessert was good but not great.  The brownie was a bit on the dry side but the rest of the dish was good.  As you can tell we made pigs of ourselves but we left feeling satisfied with the whole experience."}
{"text":"Uptown Charlotte is extremely overrated when it comes to great restaurants. While traveling to Charlotte, I tried almost every restaurant near the Epicenter and majority are underwhelming.. I was so happy to find this establishment. The Wooden Vine is definitely a diamond in the rough. Despite being extremely casual and a simple wine bar- you can get really delicious small plates.   The tapas are all natural and made from local ingredients. The hummus is simply amazing. Almost everything I tried was impressive. I would recommend The Wooden Vine before a lot of places- especially near the Epicenter. Lots of good eats."}
{"text":"We tried this place last weekend with some friends. It's a nice, cozy place for a date night. The interior of the restaurant has a very nice wooden, tavern-y feel, which I absolutely loved. Music could've been a little fancier, but it wasn't bad music per se. It's just not the kind of music you'd hear in an upscale restaurant I guess.  Food was wonderful. We tried a charcuterie board with the chef's selection of two cheeses and three meats. Those were all really good. The accompanying crackers did not taste fresh though. They were chewy, but I don't think they were meant to be chewy. They tasted like they were meant to be crunchy but had stayed out too long. We also got the crab dip and hummus which were both good.  After two beers and two bottles of merlot, the check came to $250 before tip. We were prepared to splurge, but just wanted to give everyone an idea of what to expect.  PS: The wine we ordered was the one that our server recommended. It was one of the \"cheaper\" ones."}
{"text":"Nice bar but very quiet.  Wine by the glass selection was fair at best."}
{"text":"I've heard for many months that Wooden Vine has pretty fantastic food, an interesting interior and great wine. I finally got the chance to stop in for a glass and a snackaroo and here's how it came out...  The Good: They offer a pretty nice selection of wine and small bites plus affordable sandwiches and such for lunch or a light dinner. I also saw the chalkboard that showcased a pretty sweet boxed lunch special. They also boast great daily specials that range from $5 glasses to $5 mimosas. The interior is quite cool and definitely interesting.   The Meh: When hubs and I rolled in on a Thursday evening the service was definitely lacking and fairly aloof. No one told us about the specials (which I would have ordered), welcomed us or told us anything about the place. It was a simple, \"What can I get you?\" They also had the TV (and sound) on, the music on and the lights were super bright at 8:30 pm. At least they muted the TV when we kindly asked if they would. Sensory overload. While they no longer carry the wine I ordered off the menu, the server offered another from the same area. Sure why not. The problem is, it didn't taste nearly like my original choice. Make sure the staff knows what they're selling...  The Bad: The cheese plate. Oh my the cheese plate. I love cheese. Let's just make that clear and the cheese at Wooden Vine is good. Good cheese. The problem? Two small chunks of three cheeses and a pile of ciabatta for hubs and I...$10 and 2 minutes later the cheese was gone and I'm still starvin'. I consciously tried to bite each mini piece of cheese in half so I could extend the life of our cheese but that just didn't suffice. I've had my share of cheese plates in Charlotte and this one really pales in comparison. I took a photo of the cheese plate for reference...  I may come back to Wooden Vine, but I'll definitely check out the scene before I walk in and order something besides the cheese plate...especially if I'm hungry."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab some food on Saturday night over Easter weekend and it was nearly 10pm when many places start to close in Uptown.  The weather was bad so wanted someplace close to hotel which was both casual but had good food and drinks  This place seemed to fit the bill from reviews and photo on here.  It did not disappoint as though it was a slow night it still had a relaxed energy to it  The small plate menu was diverse and ordered the recommended ttuna which was very fresh.  The liquor drinks could have been a bit better but then again this is a wine bar.  The tuna with avocado could have toned down the avocado.  As mentioned by others if looking for a place to have  relaxing meal in jeans or dressed up a bit for a show this place divides that nice casual line well."}
{"text":"I just moved to North Carolina and decided to give this local restaurants to try. my salad was very soggy it look like it was made the day before I asked the waitress to take it back due to the soggy lettuce. she did not disagree with me she said yeah you're probably right she took it back.then the chef came out to speak to me about the lettuce and told me that that is how it always looks.  I suggest you go to Wendy's and ask them where they get the produce. they probably have the freshest lettuce I have ever tried and I don't have a problem paying $14 for a salad as long as the lettuce is flash how can you go wrong on that,it is time for a change you need a new farmer. this location for the restaurant is a very very good location and has very good potential it should be packed but unfortunately things that are used in the products are probably not the best. plz chef change the lettuce and I will come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been intrigued by Wooden Vine every time I walk by, but rarely had occasion to stop in. On a recent weekend evening I finally caved and decided to have a glass. My overall impression after one visit was \"meh.\"  Let's talk wine. They do have a pretty decently constructed wine list that represents most parts of the globe (though it did feel a little California heavy on my visit, not that there's anything wrong with Cali wines). I ordered a glass of a slightly obscure cabernet that I had not had before (since I like to try new things), and it was meh. The server really couldn't tell me anything about it before hand, but we'll get to the service in a minute.  First, let's talk about price.  Given that I work in the wine industry, I'm aware of the customary markups. But this list seemed a little on the pricey side, compared to what I'm used to. Could be that I'm a cheap date, or maybe it's the uptown atmosphere.  Which leads me back to the service. Aside from no one in the room really being able to talk intelligently about the wines I was considering when I asked,other than offering scant more than what the menu stated, we were met with a coldness from the staff that honestly made me a little uncomfortable.  I felt my presence was an inconvenience to them. Maybe it's a byproduct of serving mostly Center City banker-types and they are giving their usual crowd what they expect, but at the least a smile never killed anyone.  My opinion at this time, is that there are better options in the QC. I'll give it a couple months and try Wooden Vine again and see if my opinion is swayed."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends and the food was AMAZING!!!!! The chef came out and told us about his new menu. Everything was delicious, I highly recommend trying the heirloom salad, the tartar and the pastas!! We had the gnocchi but I've heard the others are great too! Definitely order a few for the table for sharing!"}
{"text":"We came to this tapas and wine bar after having visited there on the Tour de Food Uptown.  We shared rabbit pot pie that was succulent and flavorful.  There was a sweetness to the dish that was intriguing.  The vegetables retained some texture and added a pleasing crunch.  Our next dish was lamb bahn mi sliders.  These were outstanding on crisp toasted bread, soft on the inside.  Flavorful toppings made it very tasty. The crab cakes allowed the crab to be the star, but added enough garnish to make it unique.  Finally we shared the red neck wedding cake which was outstanding.  The spicy nuts made the dish very interesting instead of just a good chocolate care with cheerwine(!) icing.  They are not afraid to go bold in this restaurant and it succeeds.  I hope they get more business so that they stay around!"}
{"text":"Order Three Things:  *Braised Short Rib-Yummy & Soooo Tender!  *Ham Mac & Cheese-Sauce flavorful but Noodles were uncooked.  *Rabbit Pot Pie-Cooked just right but on the sour side. Huge chunks of Rabbit! :)    *$5 Wine Tasting on Wednesday Nights!   *Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Good wine selection but the food is way overpriced. Or, I should say the portions are extremely small. Good quality but there are lots of places in Uptown Charlotte with food that's equally good but either with larger portions or better prices. Atmosphere is quiet and sometimes they have live music. The servers are friendly and attentive.   While I like the decor, service and wine selection, I have to say I would recommend other places over this one if you want to eat while sipping your wine."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5. Stopped by here around happy hour. There are a ton of options for wine and a limited food menu. What I most enjoyed was the ambiance of the bar, as the entire place had an aroma of fresh cut wood and was made of wood. Service was prompt and food was prepared quickly and was very hot. The spinach dip was very cheesy. Unfortunately, the crab dip lacked chunks of crab, which would have made it better. While everything was pretty good, nothing stood out as special. I'd recommend it for a go to, low key post work meet up."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7 on a Saturday night.  We we're greeted as we walked in and told to sit where ever we'd like. The wooden architecture is really beautiful and creates a cool vibe in the restaurant.  I loved this place because you don't have to yell over the music to hear each other : )  It also happened to be Acoustic night, there was a gentleman playing a guitar and singing some good popular tunes. Both of the appetizer dips (hummus, Cheese) were really tasty and their pizzas tasted fresh and yummy!   My friends and I are by no means savants when it comes to wine or beer but they seemed to carry a good selection of both.  I would recommend checking out their menus on their website to know if they carry what you like. I was slightly disappointed that they were out of two of the four desserts they carried. I ended up getting the honey orange mousse, which tasted a little bland once the drizzle of honey was gone... The service was very quick and all of the employees were super polite. I would definitely Dine and Wine here again!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot in the middle of Uptown Charlotte. Stopped here while on a trip to Charlotte after hearing it was a great wine bar. It's a very chill atmosphere where you can chose from a nice wine selection and relax. The bar itself is a long curvy piece of wood which adds a nice flavor to the bar.   The bartender was very knowledgable on all their wines and gave pretty thorough explanations as to which wines from which countries he recommended. My wine was delicious and I definitely would have had a a few more if I didn't have to head out. They also had a pretty awesome looking desert menu that i unfortunately was too full to sample, but it's the perfect compliment to a nice glass of wine. The location is perfect as its right the middle of uptown Charlotte with easy access to everything else.   Very nice place worth checking out."}
{"text":"We kind of ended up here on a whim while driving through downtown Charlotte. I had a hankering for some wine and so did my husband and in-laws (there were 7 of us).   Anyway upon our arrival, we were promptly seated at one of their comfy couches and proceeded to appreciate how awesome the décor was. I felt like I was visiting a wino Keebler elf inside his tree!! The place was cozy and had amazing wooden accents, even the bathroom was something to check out.   Now, for service, our waiter/bartender was very helpful. he was able to suggest a sweet drink for someone in our party as well as helpful wine suggestions. My mother in law and I opted for a wine flight each. Man, let me tell ya, the pours were generous and the wines incredible! I had the Sophisticated Palate and enjoyed every bit of it. The prices for the flight were not bad at all either. My family and I totally enjoyed the ambiance and great customer service. If I come back to Charlotte, you bet I would be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweet potato gnocchi and great service.  I spent $15 for lunch with the meal, drink & tip which was a great deal."}
{"text":"A rather unique little spot to pull into.  First of all, the ambiance is wonderful.  The bar is like a large tree cut in half and laid horizontally right when you walk in.  I haven't gotten a chance to try any of the food yet but the wine and bottled beer menu is rather extensive.  The wife and I love stopping in here randomly and chatting over a glass of wine.  You should really give it a try.  I will update the review once I try the food.  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"sit at the bar. the bar staff is great and recommends the best plates and wine/beer. the menu changes frequently but the sliders, tuna tacos, and quail are fantastic."}
{"text":"First time visiting for an early birthday gift and such a cool and unique spot. Located in the outer skirts of Uptown this is a hidden gem although located on a main street .   Ordered a few appetizers since everything sounds so yummy when you're hungry. The service was great although it was pretty dead coming in early part of the afternoon. Ordered the Old Fashioned which is a favorite of mine which was well made. Crab Cakes, Shrimp and I believe the meatballs is what we ordered which again very well prepared. Also ordered an assortment of cheese & meats which went very well with the appetizers.  I would highly recommend as a first time visitor and perfect for date nights or first dates. Wine assortments is very extensive also. The wood tables are also awesome."}
{"text":"NEW BRUNCH IS WORTH IT!  On Feb 23rd my friends and I were staying uptown for the weekend and had troubles finding a brunch on a Saturday without a cab ride. We found out that Feb 23rd was Wooden Vine's inaugural brunch! We were literally the first people in for an early seating. The server admitted they were still working out kinks, but rest assured the chefs were to not dissapoint. The food was divine and met the needs of our group (some hungover, some vegitarian, and all looking for a gourmet meal with good service). The meals came out somewhat staggered, but something we were able to look past since this was a 7 person party for the very first brunch served. Our waiter was upfront and we laughed it off. Will definately be back and even if you live in surrounding neighborhoods- it's worth your trip uptown!"}
{"text":"We visited the Wooden vine on the Tour De Food and then came back later that night. The atmosphere was fantastic and a young man (23yrs) who was the bartender slash wine expert was amazing, thoughtful, and helpful. We tried some amazing wines and shared the venison sweet breads. The only thing that I would say was I wish there had been more. We also tried a pork belly potsticker type of item that was amazing and very filling. It was a Saturday night and we were seated fast and had excellent service. I would not bring my country family here (they do not appreciate nice wine or fancy food) but I would bring anyone I wanted to impress."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to grab a glass of wine. Stopped in here after dinner- but looks like a great place to eat too. They have mystery wines and that's a lot of fun. I got a delicious sav blanc that I'll have to pick up from the store. The girl working here looked exactly like the actress Kristen Bell! Wow! :) Really charming place with beautiful people & decor."}
{"text":"Was getting worried about this place as it had been on a down trajectory since Andrew left but the new manager and recent bar hires have all been home runs.   Also really impressed with the new chef who started a couple weeks ago. He is local and makes fantastic roasted vegetable flatbread and does amazing things with mushrooms and peppers. Very talented young chef.   And they finally added charcuterie and wine flights to compliment their great wines. Welcome back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I have been exposed to some of my favorite wines at this restaurant. The staff especially is excellent!! Bethany figured out what types of wine I like and let me try some amazing new ones. They always remember us and even the wine glasses we prefer. There are a lot of wine restaurants in Charlotte but this one stands out. Outstanding service and selection. We bring all of our out of town guest there and we are never disappointed. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Post dinner uptown on a Friday night, we were in the mood for another drink, sans the typical uptown weekend madness (especially on a game night), enter Wooden Vine.  As other have mentioned, I did enjoy the decor, especially as we bellied up to the beautifully gnarled wood bar and took in the drink menu. A decent amount of by the glass options, and a more extensive than expected food menu, though I didn't really look to hard at it, and a (for the most part) full bar. They seemed to have some decent nightly drink specials during the week.   The music switched between soft alternative(?) recordings and a live act, but overall very relaxing for those starting their evening off slow and others just enjoying a meal. If I'm ever looking for a low-key atmosphere uptown, I'll definitely think of Wooden Vine.  Not too crowded, great staff, are there better wine bars in Charlotte? Yes. Are there better wine bars on Tryon open late? Nothing comes to mind.   Taking it from a four star to a three: with one stall restrooms for each sex, a woman thought it would be okay to hog the bathroom for something other than its purpose (I'll let you draw your own conclusions), maybe not the WV's fault, but she felt comfortable enough there to do it. Also, chefs and cooks coming out to the bar to fill up their drinks from the soda gun doesn't really bother me, I've done the same thing and I don't mind seeing who cooks the food, but having one come up using a plastic food storage container as his cup? A little unappealing, to say the least."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night and it was a very casual, laid-back environment.  The waiter told us to just pick any table we wanted, and didn't mind when we sat at a table meant for 8 since it was the only one open.  They recommended a lovely malbec to go with our meal that I wish didn't come out warm.  We ordered: A pork belly appetizer that I was excited to try but it ended up coming out as an empanada with the pork belly shredded and pulverized.   Travesty. Charcuterie plate - the cheese was good, but the meat came out shredded into little pieces.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just weird.   Romaine wedge salad - nothing special but it was good  Crab gnocchi - HORRIBLE.  I've never had such bad gnocchi before.  I don't know what they did to that potato but it was tasteless and had the consistency of clay.   I would not recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night. The waiter was very accommodating. We were able to find a wine that we had another place but couldn't find it since. The waiter offered to get us some bottles if we can by another time. The bruschetta was also very good. Great place for a  date night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit to Wooden Vine.  The place is decorated in wood throughout.  I didn't get a photo, but check out the split wooden table in the back for larger parties.  Very nice work indeed.    Let me say that the menu was brief, and not enticing.  We ended up with a cheese tray and a salad.  The salad was topped with bits of popcorn; a nice touch.  Don't visit Wooden Vine looking for a big meal, you won't get it here.  However, if you are looking to try a fairly unique wine, this is definitely the place.  The wine selection can be perused in a book.  That's right, they have a book for the wine selection but one sheet of paper for the food.  Clearly, this is a great place to sip the wine of your choosing.  I am giving them 4 stars for the wine selection and won't bother to discuss food options any further."}
{"text":"Just had my First and Last glass of Wine at Wooden Vine...waited 20 min for our second round while 4 bistros were chatting at the register..got up and went to the bar for second and last round...paid with a Hundred dollar bill and 10 minutes later no change...waitress came and said issues with register could we pay any other way...came up with cash..total 24.00  but they said sorry and bye. We had to ask what happened to the 100 dollar bill we gave them...she said OH sorry...and brought it back....and it smelled like Marajuana 3 times while sittng at the booth coming through the kitchen vents... (we owm Hvac company for a livin).....long story short...the owner needs to Clean House......they will make a better profit if they take a closer look at their employees......"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place but am going ahead and giving it 4 stars. The wine selection is fine . . . not fabu, but fine. The tapas or small plates menu is very limited but good. Cheese plates are also medicore. I love the idea and potential of this place, but the crowd seems a bit homogenous and dull . . . not young yuppies/buppies as I had hoped or am looking for."}
{"text":"Great service, wine, and food. A gem in the city of Charlotte.  What an excellent place to hang and have a good time."}
{"text":"Robbed by the bartender (David).  Charged $64.04 on a $24.04 bill with a real $5.96 tip.  David had the gull to charge a $40 tip.  It was during a pub crawl and I was pretty drunk, but little did he know that I keep all my receipts, b/c I have had this happen several times in the past.  I called to complain and spoke directly to David.  He said that he was the owner, which I find it hard to believe.  Hopefully the real owner reads this and fires him. Maybe then I will rescind this post."}
