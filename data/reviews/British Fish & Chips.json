{"text":"My favourite fish and chips kiosk in all of Calgary, I've been eating here for years. Sad to see it go."}
{"text":"While a student in London, almost half a century ago, I gained tons of weight subsisting on some of the finest deep fried swimmers and potatoes anywhere on the planet. Geale's in Notting Hill evokes fond memories.  For those who crave that wonderfully crispy greasy experience, British Fish and Chips at the Deerfoot Mall Food Court will sate the appetite of even the fussiest of real English style fish and chip eaters.  Everything is hand made from scratch and then cooked the only way you get potatoes or batter truly crispy, deep fried in lard. Those of you who bake pies or make pastries know full well the crispiest of baked items are produced using this artery clogging cooking method chock full of free radicals. But what you get is fish and chips that are to die for. Eat enough of them you probably will take your leave of us. The way to a man's heart is truly through his stomach.  Order the Haddock, that is what they eat in England. The batter is fried crunch crisp and oozes flavour. They peel their potatoes (nobody in the UK leaves the skins on), slice, blanch, and then they finally cook them the British way which is freely swimming in fat before your very eyes. The result is the greatest chips this side of the Greenwich Observatory. They are crisp like nothing you have had in Cow Town.  I have tried all the chicken, fish, and burger joints that claim to have the best fries. Maybe they do and they have a reason for not calling them chips. What is even worse is that most the fish and chip joints use frozen chips, ugh. What all these type of establishments have in common is the choice of transfat free vegetable oils. The only way fish and chips get crispy in vegetable oil is to overcook them. With lard, the real McCoy the British use, you get that crunch that rattles your ears with each bite and food cooked to perfection. Your food also does not get soggy as it cools, like with vegetable oil. Some vendors go as far as coating their chips (? fries) to fake the crispiness, not so here.  Leave your conscience at home, hop in your car or on the Number 32 Bus and enjoy some of the tastiest deep fried fare anywhere in the city, the type that will make your physician's or cardiologist's hair stand on end. It is that good."}
{"text":"Solid fresh fried fish and chips with a few fish options, crispy batter, generous chip portion, malt vinegar, and a tangy tartar sauce. A well-priced option for mall food."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for the last 20 years.  This is the best fish and chips and comparable to Britain.  I've stopped in at other joints around town, and the shear deadness has warded me off.  You'll always find customers coming for the fish and chips from this place.  From my time in england, the fish places around Kings Cross were all good, run by  nice east indian fellows.  This place here in deerfoot mall is run by a nice chinese couple for the last 20 years, and now their son.  I believe even the grandma sometimes works!"}
{"text":"So sad but this place is longer here! I wish I had called them or that a fellow Yelper updated the status of this place.  We drive in all the way from Butterfield Acres to try the fish n chips. No luck."}
