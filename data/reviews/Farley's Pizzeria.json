{"text":"We just ordered the pizza. It was tasty, but a little overpriced for a large. Farley's was recommended to me for its reasonably priced lunch specials. I will try it one of these days. I will dine at Farley's again, but for take-out (it's not dine-in friendly)."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either. Their pizzas are NY style and quite large, but the one we ordered came cut strangely (into a bunch of tiny square pieces? very odd). Wasn't terribly impressed with the toppings either- their mushrooms are the canned variety and it was light on the meat.

Ultimately I'd prefer it to chain delivery, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving a pizza. There are better places around."}
{"text":"Great delivery service. The sandwiches, pasta and salads are great. Timely and friendly delivery, the online ordering is convenient"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, food hot, would be interested in more specials. Loved the boneless wings, great sau e! Definitely will add to our pizza list."}
{"text":"Farley's is a great place to grab bite to eat.  I have been ordering delivery from here for years and the food is alway hot when it arrives at my door.

Try the White pizza, it's great and if you want a sub, you can't go wrong with their Meatball sub.

I would definitely recommend Farley's if you are looking for some good, well priced food."}
{"text":"Always order delivery from here. Online ordering very easy. Their pizza is delicious and they use delicious cheese. Both hand tossed and thin crust are phenomenal. Delivery is not always on time but always worth the wait. Breadsticks with cheese crazy good as well.  White pizza is great. I prefer thin crust because less filling. Older man that works there, acts like a manager, is a jerk to others that work there so that's why 1 less star."}
{"text":"Greek salad and wings were amazing. The greek salad dressing is my husband's favorite. The wings were crispy and juicy- Loved the garlic  parm and barbalo. Cooked and sauced perfectly.  The food is always fresh and they use top quality ingredients and everything is homemade. Awesome  pizza ( best crust) too. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Ordered boneless wings and a pie, both were great. Fast delivery. Better than any other pizza place in south charlotte."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Charlotte to get Midwest/St. Louis style pizza. They also have great bread sticks."}
{"text":"Pizza does not disappoint like most chains do.
Chase Elliott will drive the 24 car in 2015
The wings are better than average.
Sandwiches are good at Farley's too.
 The parking is very poor at this establishment"}
{"text":"I may have gotten pizza on an off-night, but I thought it was some of the worst pizza I can remember eating. However, when I've ordered the sandwiches, they have always been excellent. My biggest complaint is the sauce on the pizza was just bad. I give the pizza here 0 stars and the sandwiches 5 stars, hence the 3 star rating.  Not sure I can get up the nerve to give the pizza another chance."}
{"text":"Ok. We've been in NC for 9 months now and haven't been too impressed with the pizza here without having to spend 50 bucks for an adults and kids pizzas. This place is legit. Great amount of toppings. Kinda odd we have to pay extra for extra sauce . And the crust is a tad under cooked in the middle but with all the lovely toppings it's still very tasty. You should check it out!!"}
{"text":"First time eating Farley's tonight, I ordered delivery from the website.. They gave me an estimated delivery time of 1 hour.. The pizza actually took 1 hour 45 minutes to arrive.. So it was a Disappointing start. Once I was able to eat this Pizza, it was even more disappointing.. The individual toppings are delicious by themselves, but the crust is thin and salty? And there is basically NO sauce on the pizza. So it's more like eating flat cheesy bread. I ordered hand tossed crust, and it's extremely thin. So I can't imagine how thin the thin crust must be.
Anyways... I probably won't recommend this place to anyone or come back."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Awful food quality and terrible delivery service are the twin motto's of Farley's Pizzeria. This is another bad strip mall pizza joint. 

Their pizzas are gummy and flavorless. The chicken wings are rubbery and greezy. I have ordered for delivery a number of times and have had two complete no-shows. The longest that I have waited for a Farley's delivery was one hour and 45 minutes. The food I ordered was stone cold. (I live about 5 minutes away)

This place is a little bit more expensive than others. Don't be a sucker, Avoid this place entirely!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Came promptly, all of the extra ranch I ordered was in the order. The ranch is delicious, btw. Got the buffalo chicken salad, was awesome. Salads are very important to me, as is good ranch. Even tho the extra ranch was 75 cents each portion, you got what you paid for in size. Pizza was good. So we're the pepperoni rolls. Will definitely become a staple."}
{"text":"Just got 2 pizzas both were really greasy.  Extra cheese pizza looked like somebody just threw sauce and cheese in middle of dough and there was at least 2 inch round crust.  Almost burnt.  Ordered wings and they were good."}
{"text":"First time here....and I'm wishing I'd heard of this place sooner!  GREAT pizza! I'm from the NYC area. And am a pretty tough pizza critic. Their personal 10\" cheese pizza was as good as it gets. Great sauce! Nice thin & crispy crust, with just the right amount of grease. :-) The 10\" size was plenty for my daughter and I, and it was about $8 for the pizza and a drink, including tax. That's better than most anywhere in expensive Ballantyne, for sure. We're big Hawthornes Pizza fans -  and still will be - but this place will give Hawthornes a run for their money in my book. AND they deliver...which for Ballantyne, is tough to find."}
{"text":"Had their food for the first time today and I liked it. I had food delivered and I live pretty close. The food was hot on delivery and you gotta love that. My order was correct when it arrived, always a plus. The delivery time was fast, but again, I live pretty close so I was expecting that. 

We ordered 2 pizzas, a salad and pepperoni rolls. I will say that the pepperoni rolls were the best item to me, but would be better if they topped it with parmesan cheese or a garlic butter (or both) after it's cooked. The everyone at the house liked their food. The salad was fresh and the pizzas were pretty tasty. The sauce on the pizza wasn't anything special (taste-wise), but at least there was the right amount on it. They didnt skimp on the cheese and toppings were the amount expected.... no more, no less. The crust (bottom & edge) was somewhat soft..... not crisp. Some will like that, some wont.

Overall, I would surely order from them again. The family was pleased and that's all that matters in the end."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works here so of course we eat here a lot. My favorite thing on the menu is the Hawaiian calzone but I just tried the Buffalo pizza for the first time today and it was incredible perfect amount of hotness. I can't wait to order from them again cuz I would like to try the white pizza but I'm sure they won't disappoint. The drivers are always fast on time and very friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. Wife had a cheese steak she said it was really good she put marinara sauce on it. My daughter and I had personal pizzas. The crust was great, all fresh. We will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad not great.  Better than Papa John's, Domino's, etc, but not as good as Libretto's or Papa Murphy's.  Pasta dishes are ok for a late night meal, calzones are decent too."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice as I do like to support locally owned businesses.  But, for my taste I would have left the calzone in longer so it had a good crisp.  Also, it was served on a platter with butcher paper.  Since the calzone wasn't cut prior to serving they offered knife and fork.  Soon after cutting into the calzone I found myself cutting and eating the butcher paper.  May want to rethink that one.  But the food is good."}
{"text":"We ordered a white pizza and some boneless wings. No the were delicious! They didn't skimp on the toppings and the wings had a great medium sauce and were cooked to perfection. The pizza dough was very good and not overly greasy."}
{"text":"We ordered wings and a calzone for Super Bowl Sunday. They came exactly on time and the calzone was really good. The wings however were not the flavors we ordered and were cold. Overall not the best experience. I may try again but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Dont bother.  They cant get a simple calzone with black olives and onions right.  Order at 11.24 and 12.30 they show up, order isnt right on so many levels.  I work in a 4 story building.  So one would think that i am not the only one to place an order for 4 ppl.  Right?  So when our order gets here, we get our stuff.  Mine is not correct.  Calzone with red chunky stuff.  Well i know that is not black olives or onions.  I call and they are so confussed they cant even  begin to comprehend what i am telling them.  So once they Finally understand, oh hey we have 3 jacked orders i am told it will be 30-45 so done with them"}
{"text":"Staying at a close by hotel.  Had asked the front desk for restaurants that deliver.  This was one of 4 restaurants she gave me.  I can always go for wings! So my family and I ordered 2-20 pieces.  Hot.  Honey barbeque. Garlic parmesan.  All cooked extra crispy.  I had the hot and honey barbeque.  So good to me!  On the flyer the front desk provided, it said free 10 inch pizza with purchase of $12 or more.  Although it had no expiration, they honored it and said just give it to my delivery person - which I did. I got half pepperoni/half sausage.  It is a pretty thin crust.  No problem for me.  I love thin crust, so that was cool.  My fav pizza is pepperoni.  However, surprisingly, although the pepperoni was great, I actually loved the sausage better!  Great experience and the ETA on the delivery time was accurate.  Seems it was a little earlier than expected. Ordered last night (Sat July 1st).  If in the area again, and want pizza/wings, I will remember them!"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted good but it was burnt and sloppy I'm have to come back and give this place a second shot I'm New Yorker and is the first time I try Chicago pizza and I'm sure this place can do better.   My Nephew loves this place and convinced me to give a second chance Update coming soon lol"}
{"text":"**Update: there are few things I appreciate more than good customer service and Farley's has gone ABOVE AND BEYOND with making a customer happy. Shortly after writing my review below I received a call from one of the owners, John and he let me know I'd have a credit on my account to try them again. They just delivered our food and I have to say it is delicious! I'm very picky about my wings, and they are so good! 

Thank you to John, and the great delivery drive Lavon (may be spelling it wrong) for your great service. We will most definitely continue to order from you!




First review: Ordered delivery from them last night and it was ok. First off, I hate pizza being cut in squares, but I'm somewhat used to it as that's what a majority of pizza places did when I lived in Minnesota.

Second, it just didn't taste great. I'm willing to give them another shot, but I'll probably try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Pizza and Greek salad were excellent. Also enjoyed the garlic cheese bread. Meatball sub was delicious.  They deliver."}
{"text":"A great BBQ chicken and Buffalo chicken pizza. We haven't tried the rest of the menu because these 2 are so good. The delivery is usually much faster than they say it will be. Online ordering saves your favorites and very easy to use."}
{"text":"Chef salad was delicious and quickly prepared. Great attitude from employees Order was perfect. Open till 10pm for late time dinner."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the gut buster and chicken pineapple (SPICY bbq) pizzas.  Surprisingly good delivery pizza with creative, ready made combinations. So happy to have tried it.  Looking forward to sampling more off of their menu, esp their salads."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know what happened to the tall manager with the glasses but farley and I have had our last go round.   The last 6 or 7 times we've ordered, the pizza has been so soggy  that when you pick up a piece it brakes off into a pile of mush halfway up.  This last order was the last straw.  We got some wings with our pizza and when we came to pick them up, the B team was clearly on duty.  Nobody had on gloves while preparing food, or any head coverings and I heard them say redrop those wings to get them crispy .  Someone even remarked that they'd been out and sitting in the basket for quite a while.  Needless to say and as luck would have it, those were our wings.  Not only did they taste funny and had a rubbery texture, both of us got food poisoning which the doctor told us was linked to chicken.  Funny how that was the only chicken we ate and the timing matched up perfectly .  No thanks never again.  I'll take the weekly order for pizza night elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Tired Farley's for the first time last night.  Very good thin crust pizza and chef salad.  I think this is our new pizza place and they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Farley's was recommended to me a few days ago and I must say the overall experience and for was good. We were greeted as we walked in and ordering was easy due to the cashier at the front and her knowledge of the menu. The manager, Quintin (I think that was his name) came out to make sure the food was good and to our satisfaction which was nice. Quintin and the staff made us feel welcomed and a part of Farley's. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Forget the rediculous NY pizza comparison (New Haven, CT is best on planet anyway). So, regardless of comparing pizza 500 miles away - Farley's in Ballantyne owns the area. It's just very good pizza - every time. Lorenzo's - good, but definitely not all the time. Portofino's, very good also, but not in enough locations. Ballantyne? Don't let the name fool you, go to Farley's."}
{"text":"Farley's is our go to pizza spot!! Delicious and they deliver across the border ;) we usually get pepperoni, mushroom and bell pepper! Delicious!! We also get a side salad with blue cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent food first off! Had a pizza come out a little burnt because of oven settings. The chef brought out a new pizza voluntarily with a box to take it home. Hard to find service like that."}
{"text":"Delivery was worth the wait! Great wings and enjoyed the pizza. And the cinna stix were a hit"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I don't have very high expectations for delivery pizza as the last place I lived literally the only place that would deliver was Pizza Hut. Well I just moved to pineville and received a $5 off coupon in the mail so I figured I would try it out. For $13 I got a medium pepperoni pizza and a basically a loaf of garlic bread. So good. I have found my go to pizza delivery joint!"}
{"text":"Farley's is probably in my top five list of pizza places in Charlotte. I like both the Arbors and Lancaster location but I can't say enough great things about the Lancaster Hwy location. These folks are consistently awesome and I thank them every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. They have food that'll keep you craving more. Their wings are perfect to the bone! However their employees seem introverted and hesitant to come to the register when they are in the back. My girlfriend and I waited almost 10 minutes on someone to come help us at the desk while we made eye contact with other workers in the back. Affordable Italian eating done right."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and the wigs are perfect! The Greek salad was also amazing and full of fresh veggies! Love it."}
{"text":"I ordered baked pasta and chicken parm. hero which didn't have any taste or seasoning plus missing my extra ricotta cheese on my pasta and the hero was not on Italian bread. Anyone could have thrown this together.  I was very disappointed and I was so hungry.
They offered to have me try something else but I don't see the point unless the recipes change but I appreciate it."}
{"text":"The pizza and boneless wings are awesome! The crispy crust is delicious, and the flavor combination of cheese, sauce, and dough was perfect. We also ordered honey hot boneless wings...one of the tastiest sauce flavors I've had from any restaurant."}
