{"text":"Come for the donuts.... Not the atmosphere. 

A little hectic and small for an anxious personality, but I deal with it because it's so fast and delicious. The line may be out the door, but you'll still be ordering in 5 minutes. 

Cake style donuts, delicious every time."}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss. The actual donut was lacking flavor and the toppings didn't add much. I was completely underwhelmed with this place."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious donuts!! Ability to customize any way you like or you can pick from some suggested flavors/toppings. Either way, you'll love whatever you get!! Some personal favorites were cinnamon sugar w vanilla frosting or the peanut butter & chocolate drizzle!"}
{"text":"I have been to the original Duck Donuts many, many times, so this was a fun addition to the neighborhood. The donuts are the same, or at least I think they are--though the ambiance is cutesy, it doesn't have the shack-esque charm of the home location, which mingles with ocean air to make fried dough slathered in liquid sugar taste better. 

Mostly, I'm happy to see a homemade donut shop in the area, and would love more. These actual donuts are good, but the toppings seem to have that funky glossy additive that makes them look pretty but stick to the roof of your mouth, which I hate. I stick to the cinnamon sugar and am a happy camper."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about these donuts and how delicious they are. I don't believe it's possible to make a bad choice here. We've been several times since we moved to the area. The staff are helpful and patient with you, and make suggestions for different toppings and flavors. As well as the donuts, we've also enjoyed their bagel sandwiches and coffee. If you're passing by the area it'd be a tragedy not to stop in and order some hot and fresh donuts!"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in Charlotte!! But true coffee enthusiast will hate the coffee... The best thing to order is the beach bum. Basically glazed dipped in more sugar! Also the people are very nice. I would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I've never seen a \"make it while you watch\" donut store! I had the vanilla glaze with raspberry drizzle.  It was delicious.  I'll probably just get the drizzle next time because it was so good.   You can get it as sweet (or not as sweet) as you want.  The kiddos loved watching and the line was out the door.  It'll be our regular after church stop!"}
{"text":"These are unreal. Always hot, melt in your mouth, and so many delicious combos!! My current favorites: chocolate with rainbow sprinkles + blueberry with raspberry glaze."}
{"text":"When it comes to donuts, I am usually 'take or leave it' when I see some laying out on a table. I wouldn't normally make a special trip to actually buy donuts and usually ignore this section in the supermarket. That was until Duck Donuts came to town!

Worth the hype and more! I visited Duck Donuts on a Saturday afternoon. There were about 15 people there, so no long lines and was served pretty quickly. I ordered 3 donuts- the maple glaze with bacon on top, lemon, and orange creamsicle. I wanted to love the bacon maple donut since I love bacon so much (it's meat candy!), but something about the savory bacon and cake donut didn't taste the best together. So I guess I prefer a sweet topping instead of savory. The lemon and orange donut were excellent. So no complaints in the sweet tasting donut department.  

They weren't kidding when they say it's a HOT donut. It was hotter than I expected. That is what makes it great. It is 10 times more delicious eaten hot then some stale thing that has been sitting around for days. I don't even think I chewed, I just swallowed it whole! I thought it was going to be a heavier consisting, but it was pretty light. Hence me eating all 3 donuts in less than 10 minutes. Maybe I should start practicing and enter a donut eating contest. Hmmm, I might be on to something here...."}
{"text":"Always really delicious donuts and friendly staff.  So good that there is sometimes a line out the door and into the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Beware! Addictive! I want to try them all."}
{"text":"We got 6 different donuts. Some of them are good, some were just okay. Donuts are donuts in my opinion. They can't be bad, and with some toppings added, they get better."}
{"text":"Amazing donuts. Great service with smiles. Will definitely go again and so should you."}
{"text":"Best donuts I ever had. The cake is delicious and does not taste like it was deep fried. The menu is a little confusing therefore ordering takes a little time. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Holy smokes these suckers were good!!! Can wait to head up that way tomorrow for another round lol!!"}
{"text":"I got the maple bacon doughnut and the French toast doughnut and both were terrific. The iced coffee was good but not the best I've ever had. The service was excellent and had a nice family safe environment."}
{"text":"NUT Allergies beware! The donuts taste fabulous, but if you have peanut or tree nut allergies your choices are VERY limited. This is not because there aren't several nut-free options to choose from. It is because they keep all of the nut toppings next to all the other toppings. As an adult I can understand. However, it was very hard for my young son to understand why he couldn't have a chocolate donut with sprinkles--something every other donut store has managed to figure out without the fear of nuts. They can't even give you sprinkles if you have a nut allergy. I wish this place would do a bit more to accommodate people who love donuts who also have nut allergies. We, unfortunately, will not be back."}
{"text":"Had these donuts in OBX a couple years ago. They were awesome. So happy I don't have to drive 7 hours now. Pick up a dozen you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened a few months ago. They've got a good selection of toppings so you can create your perfect custom donut. The employees have always been friendly and patient and the store has always been spotless. I would come here a lot more if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Rainy Sunday's calls for duck donuts! Please come completely prepared, the line was out the door, be ready to order when you get to the register. Super cheap for made to order donuts. There were two employees assembling donuts and one frying donuts and they were rapid fast. It's fun getting to mix and match different combinations on your own. Maple bacon donuts, yes please!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I have ever hard. 5 stars. There is usually always a line out the door, but other than that you can bet this place is worth trying. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"Extremely good; Glazed & Cinnamon were great donuts! Must TRY!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Duck Donuts when I was living in Raleigh and was so pleased to learn that a location was opening near my house in Charlotte! These donuts are so unique. Not only can you pick your own glazes and toppings, but the actual donut is like nothing I've ever tasted. The donuts are literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're looking for a sweet treat, you have to try Duck Donuts!!"}
{"text":"I love the cinnamon sugar and the maple bacon. It's always a treat to go to ducks donuts. I would definitely go if you were think of going."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place.  I have a love/hate relationship with the fact it's so close to my house.  I'm proud that I've only been twice.... and those two times were magical."}
{"text":"A great co-worker brought them to our office.  They were still barely warm--I really liked them A LOT!!!  Even at room temp.--YUM!!!   I did not like them, though, when I went to their store & ate them hot right out of the box. They needed time to cool down a bit---only then could I enjoy the delicious flavor. The maple topped ones are my fav!"}
{"text":"Love going here early in the morning, getting a donut and a coffee and sitting outside at one of their tables. Service is fast and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST DONUTS IVE EVER HAD! I ate here about a day ago and the entire experience was phenomenal. I'm obviously not a donut expert, far from it, but I've been to several high quality bakeries, and Duck Donuts was my favorite. First of all, the main reason that you'd want to come here, is that the donuts are customizable! You can have a maple donut with graham crackers and a marshmallow drizzle, you can have a glazed donut with Oreos and a salted caramel drizzle, the possibilities are astounding! They always have free samples out, which taste so great! If they don't have them out, there is a sign saying \"Quack for More!\" The theming of the whole store is great. All the employees are so hardworking, efficient, and incredibly kind! While we were waiting for our donuts, (1/2 dozen of all different custom donuts) the guy at the counter had a conversation with us! That's the kind of work ethic that I love to see in stores. All the donuts were very reasonable priced, one donut costs less than a bottle of water! They make them live and from scratch. They're warm when you get them, but the box still says that you can hear it up in the microwave for 8-10 seconds, but it is a lot less satisfying then. The donuts are prepared in the box (if there is one for your order) and finished quickly, and the orders get very complex! Overall, the best experience I've had in a while anywhere!

(Please note that I forgot to check in, but I have the pictures down there to prove that I was there.)"}
{"text":"Warm, soft, very ordinary tasting cake doughnuts with your choice of toppings. $1.40 is the cost of a single doughnut. I like the glazed, mixed berry-filled yeast doughnuts from the nearby Whole Foods a lot better."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme's were my all time favs until I had Duck Donuts! Now, I'm not sure which I like more because both are just in a league of their own. 

Duck Donuts are rich, cakey, delicious-ness. I cannot think about them without my mouth watering. The plain donuts are great by themselves. Then when you add toppings and drizzles, whew! You can have yourself an intense treat. 

Also, their special flavors usually taste exact in what they name them i.e. Almond Joy."}
{"text":"Simply a great place to visit. Donuts are made my order, and who doesn't love picking your own combination of toppings.  
My favorite as cliche as it may sound is the bacon and glazed, and also powered donut with chocolate. Prizes are still the same as your regular donut shops as crazy as it sounds. 
One thing in which I recommend is for the workers to be more welcoming and also help one out with suggestions, they just stared at me as I explained to them it was my first time and wasn't sure what would go well together, I was still happy with the donuts I create"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Seriously fulfilled my doughnut pregnancy craving!! I'm so picky when it comes to doughnuts, the doughnut has to be light and fluffy and a bit crunchy!!! Oh and definitely hot and ready! And this did just that! My mom ordered a dozen for the whole family since it was our first time! Our favorites were strawberry shortcake, maple bacon, strawberry lemonade and vanilla coconut!! I love this place and will be back to try more flavors!! Great price for doughnuts!"}
{"text":"The best donuts. I tried the orangecisle, cinnamon bun and strawberry shortcake. They were all delish! I love that you can customize your donut with a variety of toppings."}
{"text":"Delicious warm donuts! Duck Donuts was recommended to me and they did not disappoint. I brought a variety dozen into work and everyone  loved me!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting today & it was delicious! Got a dozen & my whole family loved them. Good thing I don't live close by or this place could turn out to be a problem for my waistline. The maple bacon was an especially big hit."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts at a great price!! I got two donuts and the chocolate one was a little rich, but still good. It was warm and taste just like cake! Parking might not be the easiest, but worth it! I would come back again."}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing! The best toppings and glazes. The Donuts are made fresh and to order. Even though it's busy, we usually get out of there within 5-10 minutes. The only thing I would ask them to work on would be the drink selection. They have milk, juices, water and coffee. The coffee is served black and you put in your own cream and sugar. I think they could integrate flavored coffees or put out flavored creamer. But still, 100 times better than any other donut shop in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is way better than Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts! Each donut is made fresh to order and customized to your exact liking. Big fan of the fill out order cards, avoids a lot of confusion and makes ordering a lot easier. Even if you try new things, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you want a donut you want it from ducks donuts! Those big donut chanins should be ashamed to even offer the swill that they make each morning. Duck donuts even puts the local tampa donut shops that I frequent to shame. Each donut is freshly baked and warm to touch. Although it is an old fashioned cake donut base, it has a lightness to it like that of an airy fried donut. I had mine iced with peanut butter icing that had even a peanut butter lover like me throwing in the towel. The bacon topping is a perfect addition to the savory peanut butter and anyone who has ever combined bacon with peanut butter knows exactly what I'm talking about. Regretfully, I ate my donut extremely quickly and did not savor it nearly enough. When I return to Charlotte, I will definitely try a strawberry iced donut with coconut or one of their other bazillion flavor combinations."}
{"text":"These donuts are like no other! I love the cake-like texture, and you can tell that they are fresh! I had originally been to Cary, NC location, and was excited to see that I could still get a hold of these tasty treats after I moved to Charlotte."}
{"text":"You pick a glaze and a topping to go on a plain donut. I picked chocolate glaze with bacon and lemon with coconut. The donuts are made fresh and have a very nice crisp with a soft inside. They taste similar to beignets. I ate the donuts about 10mins after I ordered and the outside crisp prevents them from getting soggy from the glazing. They about 3\" in diameter, and in my opinion, that size could not be more perfect. 

Donuts cost $1.20, which is a steal in the boutique donut market.

I originally hail from Chicago where Glazed & Infused dominate, with Stan's close behind. Duck has them both beat. Their combination of freshness, price, size and texture make for a perfect donut."}
{"text":"We've had Duck Donuts and they are delicious.  Yesterday was National Donut Day.  We arrived at 6:53 pm and were told the store was already closed.  I realize we were trying to get in at the last minute but, if you say you're open till 7, be open till 7.  Disappointed to be turned away.  I worked retail for a number of years and we never shut the door before the big hand was at the 12, no matter how much we wanted to."}
{"text":"it was ok.  I'm in south Charlotte, so this was a bit inconvenient to get to.  The line moves fast, the cashier was very nice.  Donuts were pretty good, but $7 for a half dozen and 2 of my 6 donuts were not correct.  Parking and seating both limited.
Per my lovely Yelper friend Bianka's request I will add they are not airy like Krispy Kreme, nor heavy and cakey like Dunkin Donuts - they're right in the middle. You choose the cream (lemon, strawberry, maple etc) and toppings (sugar, coconut, bacon etc). They are also not oversized like most gourmet doughnuts, so I guess I'll just call them MTO."}
{"text":"I'm from the Outer Banks which is where the original Duck Donuts is located. You can imagine my excitement when I heard that Duck Donuts was opening up in Charlotte! The quality of these donuts still holds true. I never eat more than one donut as they are quite filling, but my favorite is the maple icing donut with bacon pieces on top. The donuts have a cake-like consistency and are always warm and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town! So fresh! You get to pick your own toppings. All the ones I've had are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   But my belly doesn't.  Lol.   The ordering can be overwhelming the first time but the end results will be well worth it!  I'm not a fan of cake donuts... But this place will make you forget that.   I can't wait to go again!  Luckily it is not in my area so I don't get to just drop by.  Lol"}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat! Duck is a unique donut shop with an assembly line where you can see your donuts being made fresh. They offer some cool flavors for coatings and toppings and my family thoroughly enjoyed the maple glaze with bacon topping! They only offer cake donuts, but you won't be missing yeast when a hot Duck donut is melting in your mouth. 
There isn't much of a dining area, but the atmosphere was buzzing and the shop is in a sweet location. 
This place is a must if you live in Charlotte - I  look forward to making the half-hour drive to experience Duck Donuts again soon!"}
{"text":"Duck donuts are the best! We got these all the time when we were vacationing in Duck... What luck they came to Charlotte! They are fresh and awesome every time! It doesn't get any better..."}
{"text":"This place is okay for my taste. I like my donuts nice and fluffy where when I bit into it it just melt into my mouth. I give it a two start is because the donuts taste a lot like sugar coated bagels. So that is the reason why I give it a two star."}
{"text":"Amazing, freshly prepared cake doughnuts. They are a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just enough substance. They are flat out amazing. Oh, and you get to customize the flavor. My favorite: maple glaze with freshly diced bacon. So, so good"}
{"text":"These doughnuts are the most fresh, flavorful and delicious doughnuts around.  They have a wide variety of glazes and toppings (the cinnamon and sugar topping is the best!). All of their doughnuts are made to order and you actually get to watch them make them in front of you... A great place to take kids, or friends.  Also, such a fun place to go for dessert, breakfast, parties, or to fill any doughnut craving!  
*Make sure you check out their hours before you go, they are sometimes closed by 3:00, but on Wednesdays close at 7:00pm"}
{"text":"Very yummy donuts. Certainly a different assortment of flavors. My daughter had to have the bacon flavored. She enjoyed that very much.  Donuts were not and fresh. A little hard to find & parking lot is somewhat crazy but worth the trip from Fort Mill SC."}
{"text":"Very busy on weekend mornings, but the line moves quickly.  Much better choice than Krispy Kreme or Dnkin Donuts!"}
{"text":"Ducks Donuts is delicious! If you are a fan of the cake donuts - than this is the place for you. My favorite icing is the lemon with the coconut springs on top. Check them out if you're in the charlotte area!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is so \"fabulous\".  The doughnuts themselves taste like deep fried cake batter, and the toppings are so over loaded it completely ruins the doughnut.   I'm sure I am in the minority of opinion,  but for me, they are eh."}
{"text":"Love'em! Easy, fun, delicious. The staff is wonderful. This location stays true to their other home base locations in Duck, NC (Outer Banks). If you like a cake style doughnut then you will LOVE THESE GUYS. You can get creative with their toppings which are as traditional as chocolate icing and sprinkles to as trendy as maple icing and bacon bits! (Seriously though, the latter taste just like pancakes and bacon breakfast). Add to all this that the doughnuts are always fresh and warm...yep this one is a winner! If it weren't for childhood devotion to the Krispy Kreme style doughnut I'd give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just
Yum.

So fresh great ingredients. Warm but not too warm, everything made in front of you. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sometimes a co-worker who lives near their location will bring  doughnuts to the office and they disappear very quickly.  The doughnut are very good, and just taste better than the big chain doughnut shops.  Good thing I do not live near their location, I would be in there all the time."}
{"text":"All (in fact everything) fresh made to order hot donughts.. .. How many of you had a donughts that's warm and melts right on your tongue. Best in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Went in first time on Saturday August 5th.  Service was great and I ordered 4 vanilla glazed with sprinkles. The donut had a great taste with a texture like cake on the inside.  I'm not a big fan of donuts for health reasons but will definitely go back.  I hate how people complain online without giving local ownership a chance to correct any problems in a new business.  I hope they are successful"}
{"text":"We LOVE Duck Donuts.  Fresh, hot donuts made to order - just the right amount of crisp to the outside with soft, doughy interiors.  We have trouble NOT ordering way more than we need.  The atmosphere is always friendly and cheery, even when it's packed to the gills.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The customer service is wonderful
The Doughnuts can not be beat
Just know that each order is made to order so plan on staying for a few minutes, however those few minutes can be so very entertaining"}
{"text":"After living in Charlotte for 3 months, I would say that donut options in Charlotte are pretty limited.  This place doesn't compare to Votex in Asheville, Sandy's in Fargo, or Voodoo in Portland, but probably the best in Charlotte.  The one thing Duck Donuts has going for them is that they are served hot.  The glazes are simple and tasty (orange and maple), but honestly they remind me of Super Donuts (vitamin fortified donuts from my elementary school days).  If you really want a donut, try Duck Donuts."}
{"text":"Warm delicious famous donuts! Have tried the one in Kill Devil Hills and Cary, and both great. Nice owners and managers at each. If in a town they are, give them some business."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for the first time after reading numerous reviews and looking at all the delicious looking donuts in the reviews. Got here at about 830(good smells upon entry) and there was a little line but it moved so fast by the time I got to the register I had to let two or three other people go because I wasn't ready to order! They have several options for coatings and drizzles and topping so I was having a hard time on what to try. I ended up getting a half dozen and was impressed! Will definitely say lives up to its reputation for sure and a must try! All donuts are made to order which is a win! Can't remember what six I picked but the picture sure does look good! Will be added into my rotation of places to visit on the regular!"}
{"text":"Wow, great donuts, what a selection,"}
{"text":"YUM!!! Why don't more people talk about this place?! I think it's because they want to keep it a \"hidden\" gem... no other reason I can think of, because I'd be bragging about my amazing donuts. 
Maple bacon is always a solid choice. 
The strawberry was just a tiny bit too sweet for my liking. The marshmallow drizzle topping helped even it out. 
Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong here. Prices are low and the donuts are seriously delicious.... I'm even going to go as far as to say better than the cult following favorite VooDoo Donuts (gasp!)
The donuts here are like a buttery funnel cake. Super flavorful, moist, and delicious. A perfect donut. Don't miss it if you're in town!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Donuts, open early so I can get a convenient treat to take to work on special occasions."}
{"text":"Being new to the area we really enjoyed the different way of making donuts! The maple bacon was delicious. The donuts are warm and sticky and they get them made fast, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love that you can pick your own coatings and toppings. My favorites were probably the glazed and lemon coconut donuts. A little too sweet, but delicious overall."}
{"text":"Small, off the main street, hard to find, but well worth the effort! Unquestioned, the best cake donuts in Charlotte! My second visit here was even better than the first. The people taking your order are always polite and helpful. The girls making the donuts are always smiling and offering to \"give you more toppings\" and being sure your order is just right. The minute your donuts choice hits your mouth, you know \"This is the best!!\""}
{"text":"Duck Donuts never disappoints!  First had Duck Donuts in Outer Banks and was THRILLED to  see we have one in Charlotte.  TOTALLY WORTH MOVING HERE!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!! Warm, delicious, and however you want them. The only thing that I don't like is the line at some busy points of the day."}
{"text":"Best donut place I have ever been to. Do yourself a favor and try the maple bacon dount. It is incredible!"}
{"text":"Best. Donuts. Ever. Seriously, stop in and try them out. Good coffee too, but the donuts are hard to beat! Doesn't even have to be for breakfast, stop in for an afternoon snack!"}
{"text":"All their donuts taste great, my favorite combo lemon icing with raspberry drizzle. We went Sunday morning and the line was almost out the door."}
{"text":"Very unique concept. Made to order doughnuts that are totally unique and nothing like any doughnut you've had before! The whole place smells delicious, they also have great coffee. But, I can see the concept going further, it stops just short of being amazing."}
{"text":"If you need a serious sugar overload, you are in the right place. You can completely customize your sugary heaven by picking the glaze, topping and drizzle. Their donuts are a cross between Krispy Kreme, Cake, and Heaven. When they're warm and fresh - there is just nothing better. My favorite is the oreo topping with a chocolate drizzle. You really can't go wrong with any of the options. They also do seasonal offerings for holidays!"}
{"text":"I love these donuts! They are not too big and so tasty! I've tried a lot of donuts but this place is one of my favorites! Although I've tried many different flavors, I'd have to say the good old powdered donut is still my fav flavor =)"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! The process of watching the donuts getting made is so fun! We ordered some of the special donuts but you can create your own custom flavors as well. The breakfast sandwich was very good as well. You can get it on a bagel or a donut! 

They are busy on the weekends but it is worth the wait. There is limited seating inside and outside. Parking is available in the back as well."}
{"text":"When I lived in Charlotte, I worked across the street from Duck Donuts. I should give them one-star for what they did to my waistline but I'll have some mercy.

It can be hard to catch that \"hot\" light at Krispy Kreme, but the donuts are ALWAYS fresh here. My favorites were the plain, regular-glaze, maple-icing and cinnamon sugar. You can mix and match your dozens to fit your office's preferences and make sure everybody gets what they like. And, because the donuts are so damn fresh, they are still warm after your commute to wherever you're going.

The donuts are large, so one is equal to two Krispy Kreme donuts in my opinion. 

This location is totally accessible on the bus, if you are not a driver in Charlotte. You can catch the outbound 6K (Kings Drive) and get off at the East Blvd and Scott Ave stop, and walk about one country block. Then go home via taking the 25 to the lightrail, and lightrail to the bus station.

4 stars instead of 5, only because the place could look just a tad cleaner."}
{"text":"The donuts are tasty and the service is outstanding. These donuts are so much fresher and better than anywhere else. The staff is super friendly and the store is very clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"remind me of deep fried pancake batter. and glazing/drizzling while hot means the cake just can't stand up to the sugar. 
i had higher hopes.  
oh well!"}
{"text":"22 minutes to wait for a dozen donuts and surly service?

Pass.

The donuts are decent.  But getting a decent donut in this town is a dime a dozen.  

This is my fifth visit and the staff is so rude I can't imagine that they have the nerve to post a sign that says they guarantee a courteous experience!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday around 11am. It was really busy the line moved very quickly. We had never been and the ordering system wear very easy.
We got 3 donuts:
1. Chocolate icing, bacon, and salted Carmel drizzle = AMAZING. I didn't share it. This donut was SO good. 

2. Cinnamon sugar donut= I didn't try it but my husband loved it

3. Peanut butter icing, chocolate sprinkles = this one was wayyyy too sweet. I LOVE super sweet things, and the peanut butter icing was way too much for me. I couldn't eat it. As you can tell by my 1st donut, sugar overload is rarely a problem. But this one was just overboard. And I love peanut butter. 

Overall we had a great experience and enjoyed some really delicious custom donuts!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a big donut person but OH MY GOSH. These donuts were so good and still warm when I got them home too! I like how you can customize them and they were only $7 for 6 donuts, that's a good deal. I got pecan coffee and it was delicious as well. Not to mention they're open later than most donut places! 10/10 I'm a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Insanely good.  Didn't think anyone could measure up to Krispy Kreme.  Maple bacon donut is delightful"}
{"text":"I am updating this review based on the response from management regarding my concerns. I was contaced and the conduct of the staff seemingly addressed. I went in again this morning and everyone was as polite and helpful as they have been in the past."}
{"text":"My guess is that they don't advertise enough...or this place would be hard to get in the door...they just have the best donuts ever. Ever. The maple covered doughnuts with peanuts are my fav. Look if you are a fitness nut - splurge one day a week here. And get over yourself Tribe."}
{"text":"I have to say, Kevin and I are not a fan of cake donuts.  They are normally dry, dense, and leave a bad after taste.  One of my coworkers brought these donuts in one day and I thought they were good!  I told Kevin we needed to go, and he kind of had the eh, not really interested, they are cake donuts.  I somehow convinced him to try them out on a Saturday afternoon after we had finished hiking.

We arrived to Duck donuts and I ordered a maple bacon, chocolate peanut butter, strawberry blackberry, vanilla cookie, and strawberry with chocolate sprinkles (was supposed to have been taken off as I went with the strawberry blackberry instead as suggested by the guy at the counter, oh well, not an awful mistake, just unnecessary).

They were quick to make the donuts.  As soon as I got back in the car with Kevin, I opened up the box and had to have a bite (had to put the dog in the back seat and make him suffer!).  We immediately had a bite of the maple bacon and strawberry blackberry - both excellent!  Kevin was already hooked!  They are awesome when they are warm and freshly made, of course very messy that way, but oh so worth it.  

We tried the others we tried the next morning - reheated up in the microwave - still good!!  The chocolate peanut butter was also a hit.  The strawberry with chocolate sprinkles, eh, a miss, and really should have not been part of the order.  The vanilla cookie was also just okay.  I think it would have been better had the cookies actually been cut up chunks of the cookie to bite, rather than the fine crumb, can't really taste that it is a cookie on top.

Kevin already wants to go back, more than I do, which is a huge surprise, but I think they won him over with the large quantity of crumbled bacon on the donut.  We can't wait to go back and try others.

Overall, excellent, the best cake donuts and at a wonderful price!  We will be back.  Only con is that they have very little seating inside and do not have much  outdoor seating (which is sad for a very dog friendly area), but it's not like they have the room for tables and chairs either."}
{"text":"It's there Anniversary Today, sept 12, 2016!! 

1 Free Donut / Order!! Yay!!!

Free Donut Stationary!! How neat!!"}
{"text":"This branch was ok. It is not the one off east blvd. in Dilworth, but it was ok. 

I got the basic donut with cinnamon sugar on top. It came slightly warm and crusty like it had been sitting under the heat lamp. That's something you rarely see in Dilworth if ever."}
{"text":"I came to visit from out of town and heard raving reviews about Duck Donuts! Checked it out online and knew I had to try it! It surpassed my expectations!

I live in Toronto and we have a lot of popular donuts shops! There's a particular one closer to my house and I've just had it so many times that I've been craving for new ones! I absolutely love Duck Donuts! What I liked about it most is that they serve it warm! Sooooooo good warm! It just melts in your mouth! 

We informed the person working there that it's our first time. He was very friendly and explained the menu to us and how it worked. And even gave us some recommendations and what some customer favourites are! We went with flavours that we would typically like and absolutely loved it! The flavours weren't too empowering, it was just right! We wish we could've brought some home to share with our families (or not)!"}
{"text":"the maple syrup donuts with bacon on top is sooo good. I'm not really a donut fan but this was too good. Came with friends and we all really liked it. Wish the place was bigger though..and had more seating spots to eat the donuts. Half of us were standing and eating."}
{"text":"Customizable donuts, this is a thing now.  And yes, they are fresh off the line, but I wasn't impressed with the quality of the donut, or the variety of toppings, which is pretty standard.   I've had better fresh donuts, and better topping options.  Duck donuts, however, marries both together, so you have that going for it."}
{"text":"My family and I finished up with the Triple C 5k on Saturday and figured a stop by Duck Donuts was in order. The place was busy but not too long of a wait. Between the five of us we split a dozen donuts and sampled each one. Top favorites included the blueberry glaze, PB and chocolate, strawberry with sprinkles and maple bacon.  Honestly all were hot and delicious....dangerously delicious. Definitely a treat every once in a while in my future."}
{"text":"Delicious Donuts just like when we're at the beach but Now I don't have to go to the Outer Banks for Duck Donuts!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong at this place. Even if you don't like donuts it's a must try. INCREDIBLE. So fresh make your own etc. do your self a favor and atleast get 1/2 dozen so you can try a few. They are insanely good."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before and had no idea about the make-your-own-and-get-it-fresh thing. I got a coffee and one donut for a total of $4.01. (The donut is $1.30 which is ridiculous even for made fresh and customizable.)

After paying, I saw a sign for a coffee and two donuts, $4.25. I asked if I could get that deal. They asked a manager and said the manager said no.

Why? You can't just say no. At its most elaborate, you have to do a refund and a resell, and it's a bummer sure but you don't refuse someone a gorram refund.

I really needed that second donut too. I'd chosen one of their suggested vanilla drizzle, and it really didn't lend itself to being drizzled hot. Got all melty and unpleasant.

I want to but I can never go back now that I feel they owe me and suck. XP"}
{"text":"Ok soooo this place was OK. I'm sure if we took the donuts to GO they would not taste as tasty as they were since we had them piping HOT after a 15min wait. 

We brought a half dozen since it was only $1 more than getting 4 donuts. We tried a Glaze, Orange Glaze, Strawberry and Lemon Glaze. The orange glaze had the best taste.

Basically all the donuts taste the same as they are all the same recipe and only the way they are topped (glazed) is what make them a different flavor. We are not the biggest fan of them and only headed there because we were in the area and I noticed a friend check-in on FB there with a picture of the orange glaze and it looked  yummy so we stopped in just in the nic of time as they were closing at 3 and we arrived at 2:54pm on a Sunday.

The place was pretty packed as they are well known and well liked. There were also a lot of people showing up and having to be turned around because the place closed and they were done making donuts for the day.

Overall, I wouldn't make the drive to have a donut from here and would however have ONE just ONE (as they are pretty thick and fatting I'm sure) if I was in the area and in the need of a sweet fix."}
{"text":"During the Christmas break, we went to Duck Donuts for an outing and our first visit.  I ordered the donut (one kind, no chocolate) with peanut butter glaze and a coconut topping.  It came warm and was very delicious, I must say.  Why three stars then?  I think this place could have been SO much better.  

After going to Voodoo Donuts in Portland a couple years ago, everything else is pretty disappointing.  Apparently, they're kind of a mecca for donut lovers.  The consistent line out the door and down the street was a definite indication.  Why?  First, their donuts are huge.  Duck Donuts' are regular-sized.  Second, there are endless combinations of unique flavors.  Duck Donuts has only a handful.  You can pick out one glaze and one topping.  That's it, no more.  No, you can't have both peanuts AND sprinkles; are you crazy?  And where are Oreos?  Donuts and Oreos were made for each other.  Third, at Duck Donuts, you create your own.  While the warm donut part is nice, there aren't all of these magically created donuts already made for you to gawk and drool over.  I had a tough time deciding which donut to pick at Voodoo Donuts.  At Duck, it wasn't that hard given the very limited options.  

Lastly, there are about three two-seater tables in the whole restaurant.  That's it.   We had to stand around to eat our very sticky donuts (and then rush to the bathroom to wash our hands).  There's a huge wasted space in the middle of the store that could easily be filled with a lot more tables, if rearranged better.  

Anyway, while I really enjoyed the donut I tried, I'm not jumping on the Duck Donuts bandwagon and making it a regular thing when I know there are so many things they could do to make it a truly magical experience."}
{"text":"If I would not get insanely fat, I would eat Duck Donuts for EVERY meal. I am being SO serious, they are THAT GOOD! If you haven't stopped by, definitely do - the staff is so friendly and patient (I take a bit longer than I should deciding what delicious donut(s) to eat)!"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot and so many options. The donuts are cooked to order and there is little seating. They have breakfast specials and great coffee. They also have bottled water, juices, and soda options for non-coffee lovers. There is a donut choice for everyone no matter your taste preference."}
{"text":"The texture of these donuts are different than regular donuts. It's like a mixture of cake and bread. It's one like any of your regular donuts. It's made to order by picking your own glazed and toppings to the bare donuts. It's warm, fresh and sweet. It's still soft and delicious the next day also."}
{"text":"THESE DONUTS ARE DELICIOUS!!  My husband and I like to keep it simple with the cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar (no toppings, no icing).  What makes these donuts amazing is they're practically cake and always made to order and served warm.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Maple Bacon is by far the best!! Coconut lemon was also delish! Chocolate & peanut butter was so-so. It is all the same cake donut covered in your choice of toppings. Can't wait to go back & try more!"}
{"text":"Super friendly workers and endless possibilities for donuts! I get anxiety about making food choices so I went to their website and had my choices all written down and ready to give. I can't wait to get home and eat mine (it's gonna be a loooong 4 hours)"}
{"text":"ODERER A MAPLE BACON. Just do it. Such a great combination of flavours. \"I'll take a maple bacon, please\". It's what makes them so great! Ugh there is nothing like a fresh, hot donut.

I feel bad because we can in 5 mins before closing. But the served us and it was super fast. Wish their debit receipts had tip spots so I could of tipped them. I didn't have any cash on hand :("}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, amazing! My husband and I decided to give it a try and we're so glad we did! So yummy and an inexpensive little treat to do together. So glad we came, we'll be back! The hubs loves the maple bacon and honestly I tried it, it was so good!! Impressed. Fresh, clean, great environment"}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts around! I try and get here a couple times a month for a special treat. All their donuts are fresh made to order. You can customize with a crazy number of toppings. My personal favorite is the vanilla frosting, oreo crumb and hot fudge drizzle!"}
{"text":"Awesome warm, Bacon maple donuts!! But all I have had are great..Never went when there was a line, but I guess it can get busy..Price about the same as Dunkin Donuts but SO much better!(the more you buy they get less$) Cool T shirts and rubber ducks to go too..Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite part of Duck Donuts is picking out random combinations of glazes and topping. I love to stop in before work and grab a \"bucket\" and let my co-workers guess the flavors. Made fresh to order these donuts are always a perfect break from the hustle and bustle of life. I highly recommend. Hell I want to own one of these stores."}
{"text":"Great donuts! The maple bacon one is our favorite! They put like a mountain of bacon on there, fresh delicious, glistening, golden bacon, not the dry bits that some other places offer.

There are more of a cake donut and they are denser, yet airy at the same time.  

It's such a cool place. You can see them making the donuts and they're always nice and warm!

We almost went to some other place, but it was closed so we found this place and we were ecstatic."}
{"text":"The cake donuts are light and airy. Always warm. The glaze is perfectly sweet and the topping options include bacon. What else is there to say."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Warm donuts you get to watch them make with delicious toppings and icing. Reasonable priced and the wait isn't bad. Anything combination imaginable, you get to choose!"}
{"text":"People warned me about Duck Donuts! It was a fair warning. How can you not love a place that prepares hot, delicious donuts to order. 

You can not go wrong with the glazed donut. It is a bit of perfection. It's as if a deep-fried State fair donut and a cake donut had a perfect offspring. My next fave is the strawberry icing, which has bits of real strawberry in the icing.

The customer service was quite good. On my visit, there was a staff of young people working. I really appreciated the great customer services provided...with a smile.

I can't wait to try some of the seasonal options."}
{"text":"Wow!!..on a layover in uptown Charlotte and yelped \"Best donuts\" ...walked 1.5 miles to get to Ducky Donuts and it was SO worth it!! What I loved the most is how they make it just the way you want it!! I had peanut butter glaze with real bacon and drizzled fudge, and a chocolate glaze with coconut...yes, I ate them both and they were divine!! Super nice people and service too!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other yelper reviews...if you're in this neighborhood and craving something sweet this place will definitely do the trick! 

I stopped in before the afternoon rush, and trust me it's easy to get overwhelmed. This place has a lot going on! There are tons of flavor combinations, staff buzzing around behind the counter and those eagerly awaiting their creations. 

This place gives you tons of freedom. Think of yourself as a personal chef. It's up to you to get creative. They will top your cake donut with whatever glaze and topping your prefer. There's a good bit of options but don't worry....they have plenty of suggestions that let you expire all kinds of flavor combinations.

For me, the donuts were okay. I tried a chocolate and a vanilla - with sprinkles. They aren't bad by any means. I just expected more. To be fair, I took mine to go so I had to warm them up to get the full effect on a warm donut. 

But they cured my sweet tooth so for that I was happy. The service was meh. The girls seemed more interested in talking to each other than taking my order. But I'll chalk it up as a busy day.

If I'm in the area, I'll give them another try to check out another flavor combination. And see if they can completely win me over."}
{"text":"I had heard of the hype, but it wasn't until I saw the line out the door until I realized this must be the real deal.

I've frequented some of the fancier donut shops in the country. Voodoo and the like and I get it. A fresh donut done right is a beautiful thing, but these guys are stepping in on Krispy Kreme's territory. Now I see how they can be so cocky. Fresh, made to order donuts? Maple bacon, chocolate coconut and the like. All moist and delcious. So good it would make the busy burbs be willing to stand in long lines to get them.

I'm not super thrilled about the line, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever? Yes. 
Before today I didn't think you could do any better than a hot fresh Krispy Kreme. But Duck Donuts changed the game.

So we went on a Sunday morning about 9:30, couple people in front of us, not crowded parking lot. But by the time we left, still before 10am, the line was out the door.

The maple bacon donut was amazing. Hard to describe why it is so amazing, so just try it.  They used some tasty bacon, no bacon bits. And the donut texture was yummy, cake batter style. And they come out warm. 

I just wanna go back and try everything. So glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"Look no further! The best donuts are here! Why? Because you get to make them the way you like them. 
Not just because you can get caramel with bacon on it -or strawberries with cheese on it....it's just the fact that donuts were meant to be personalized and here, you get to do just that."}
{"text":"My wife read about this place on a foodie blog created by a classmate from college. As a former long time resident of Charlotte, I was surprised I never heard of this place so we planned to go next time in Charlotte. It was certainly worth the trip, the place was packed but the line went fast. And as a nice bonus for waiting, the have free samples of fresh donut holes available. The bring out a new tray for customers every few mins. We paid about $15 for a dozen but with all the various options...you get much more for your money! Definitely a MUST stop every time we're in the QC."}
{"text":"While I am a die-hard Krispy Kreme fan, Duck Donuts' light and tasty cake donuts are hard to beat!  The toppings are fantastic and the donuts are as fresh as they can get. I've tried the Glazed, Vanilla, Strawberry and Maple Bacon (one of their best!), but the death blow for me was the warm Salted Caramel drizzled over a freshly-baked still-hot donut. OMG.  They open at 6am every day, so you can grab a box on the way to work. Order 'em online and they'll be waiting for you when you arrive.

Regardless of what kind of donut you favor, you'll be happy with Duck Donuts!"}
{"text":"The donuts were great and there are plenty of combinations to try. They were very busy but still handled orders efficiently and with a smile."}
{"text":"Great donut shop!  Similar to Peace, Love, and Little Donuts.  It is a toss up between the two for me, but I tend to go to Duck Donuts because it is more convenient.  The line can get long on weekend mornings, but the staff are nice and they get you in and out quickly (and have samples while you wait).  Great coffee and iced coffee too.  My kids and I love it and you can either build you own or order a store designed donut."}
{"text":"Thanks to all these reviews about this place I had to come check it out for myself. I'm so glad I did because there doughnuts are so amazing and fresh. You guys have to try this place out. My new doughnut spot for sure."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Duck Donuts? I was exposed to craft donuts while living in Portland, Oregon where Blue Star and Voodoo Donuts reign, although I like the underdogs, like Pips. Voodoo is overrated and while they have creative donuts they aren't actually that tasty. Blue Star is very good. Here in NC, we have a few donuts shops and Duck Donuts is one that has been long standing and for good reason. They have a variety of flavors to choose from, or you can customize your own from icing to toppings. NEW- they also have a bacon egg and cheese sandwich between donuts which is genius. It is delicious with a maple glaze and a great way to get some protein to slow the sugar spikes from the donuts. They also have coffee available. Workers are friendly and donuts are made as you wait, no pre made cold donuts here. Love going here!"}
{"text":"I am not the biggest cake donut fan. But these are a game changer. They are heavenly!  All I can say is I have driven from Ballantyne twice in one week to indulge. Heed my advice and order the maple with bacon. They rival any of the more expensive local gourmet shops.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Typically I think of a dry, super dense when you say cake donut. Duck doughnuts are crispy on the outside and rich and buttery inside. Similar to a churro. Best donuts I've ever had. Beware icing is a little sweet. Maple bacon and cinnamon sugar were my favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! This a a must stop on the foodie list!! Look at the menu in the photos above or online and have a thought of what you want to order. If not, you will stand there with a ummm ummm moment."}
{"text":"Deliciousness at its best!!! Get out and join the Craze. You will not be disappointed.

Tons of toppings, glaze, and flavors to jazz up your traditional donuts.

Be sure to get them when they are rolling fresh out of the fryer."}
{"text":"This says it all...my husband said, \"I'm sure glad it isn't close to home!\" Close to my work though! If you like a cake donut and icing then you have found your go to donuts shop."}
{"text":"The concept here is build your own donut for $1.40. You start off with a plain cake donut, fresh from the fryer, and you choose your toppings. Since they're made to order, it takes a while to get your donuts. On the other hand, they taste so fresh! 

My husband and I ordered three donuts when we stopped in and our donuts were still warm. I'm usually not a fan of cake donuts, but when they're warm, slightly crunchy to the bite, yet soft in the middle, I can definitely learn to like them. The toppings take them to the next level. It's nice to get to pick exactly what you want on your donut. 

I would definitely come back, but only to order a single donut whenever I'm craving a donut for dessert. I imagine ordering a dozen would take them quite some time to make and could get a little expensive."}
{"text":"Had my first trip to Duck Donuts last weekend during its first week of operation. I was extremely impressed with the speed, process, facility & workers. 

The donuts are all the same: traditional cake donuts. You can pick your frosting/glaze, and then any addition toppings they offer. Everything is MTO so you know it's gonna be fresh! And with the endless options, you're gonna want to get at least a 1/2 dozen to try a bunch. 

My favorites so far: maple bacon glaze with bacon crumble, orange glaze & vanilla frosted costing in cinnamon & sugar. 

I was very excited for the strawberry frosting, but was disappointed in the end. It was good, but not nearly the strawberry flavor that I was anticipating/hoping for. 

Peanut butter loves will love to peanut butter frosting with a chocolate drizzle and chocolate sprinkles"}
{"text":"I am so kicking myself for not checking this place out sooner! Their donuts are custom-made for you, the base donut is so delicious with a perfect balance of density and softness, and they're toppings are absolutely yummy! I ordered the maple glazed with bacon topping and a strawberry glazed with rainbow sprinkles. This will be my new donut go to from now on out! My only critique would actually be of the decaf coffee which was a bit watered-down but other than that they rock!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy. My unborn son was doing backflips. Lol.  Doughnuts were warm, light and non greasy. Great combo. Quick and simple service. Limited flavors, yet endless options. The coffee was also pretty tasty, but ridiculously lava hot. I can see many trips in our future.  :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to this tasty establishment! The donuts were fresh and made to order. I had no idea there were so many additional toppings you could choose from for no extra costs. 

I ordered a cinnamon sugar (yum), vanilla frosting with salted caramel  (yummy), and a maple frosting with powdered sugar (just, wow!). I don't like super sweet, granulated frosting but their frosting is creamy and just right.
Treat yo self and stop into Duck Donuts, you'll be glad you did!
^.^"}
{"text":"The bacon in the sun donut just might be the best thing I've ever tasted.  It was that sinfully, magical combination of salty-savory and sweet.  It was certainly worth the wait to have it made to order.  I regret only trying one flavor and will definitely head back the next time Im in the area to sample more of their offerings."}
{"text":"You can't beat these fresh donuts. The dough is great and my favorite part about their donuts is how crispy they are. The glazed is by far the best"}
{"text":"I shouldn't come here, but I do. These are excellent cake donuts, and you can customize them to your liking. Staff is friendly, service is quick. Coffee is good. And they usually have a donut to sample on the counter!"}
{"text":"I just tried the maple bacon donut and my life is forever changed. I don't think there is a combination better than maple and bacon."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts.  Very good texture.  It's a hybrid between a Krispy Kreme and a cake donut.  The best part is they are made fresh and the frosting/toppings are fresh as well.  I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to donuts, so I liked the glazed, chocolate frosting and the cinnamon sugar with the vanilla frosting the best.  The fruit frosting ones are decent; the lemon and orange ones are the best.  I was not a fan of the peanut butter or strawberry frosted donuts.  This is a must stop for me anytime I am in Charlotte!  

One kind of negative thing about this place is that service is very slow because of the freshly made donuts.  Since they're not pre-made, it takes awhile to make.  But it's totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I can't decide it it's a good or a bad thing that I can walk to this place from my house.  Seriously the best donuts I've ever had.  They're a cake style donut, but much lighter than D&D or similar places.  I have a number of favorites, but my go-to is the cinnamon-sugar with vanilla frosting.  AMAZING! I also love the chocolate mint and the peanut butter.  The maple, strawberry/orange/lemon versions are all fairly subtle, so you won't be be hit over the head with over-the-top sugary flavoring.  Staff always seems to be nice and attentive, too.  I seriously can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I can't even begin to describe the pure magnitude of joy that exudes when I bite into a fluffy doughnut. Ducks is an amazing delight with each bite, and an utter surprise of jubilation. The variety of toppings is endless: this makes each creation a magnificent mystery worth exploring. Do yourself a favor, go get a doughnut. I'm sure you deserve it!"}
{"text":"The slightly higher cost of their donuts is easily justifiable because you definitely get more for your money.  It is not an everyday donut but more of an occasional special treat.  Unlike other donuts I doubt that I would be able to eat more than one in a single sitting because it is a bit rich.  The ability to customize your donut adds a lot to the buying experience.  I will definitely go back if I am in the Dilworth neighborhood.  A very good first experience with Duck Donuts!"}
{"text":"This place has nice coffee!! 
Donuts are awesome .. here you can make your donut... with icing and sprinkles .. which was kind of new to me.. 
we ordered donut with blueberry icing and that was so good .. 
I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Doughnuts are certainly a treat to be held (and eaten) on specifically special occasions. Or, in the case of Duck Donuts, any time the urge befalls your day. Having good, nay, fantastic doughnuts in the hood is something that is somewhat of a foreign concept to Charlotte, for the most part. You've got your larger brands with plenty of presence, but having a smaller company show up in good ol' Crown Town is a welcome sight. 

Now, doughnuts are not too difficult to make acceptable in most doughnut-eaters' eyes. Serve em warm, slathered with glaze, and not much else. You're on your merry way to a great day when hot doughnuts are thrown in the mix. Duck Donuts is doing it right. Though, their process is pretty unique from others. 

First of all, the menu is rather simple. Doughnuts, coffee, a few breakfast sandwiches, and a few other things here and there. You order your doughnuts from the counter by singles or by the dozen, they are prepared on-the-spot, and served at the other end of the counter. 

The apparatus that forms and fries the doughnuts is so rad. It's a automatic dispenser that drops the perfectly formed doughnuts into the oil and then moves them along a conveyor belt. It's unlike any other I've seen. They do happen to have two of these guys for when the lines get longer and they need to crank out more fried dough. 

Note: ALL of their doughnuts are of the same base. (Cake Doughnuts) I.e. Not a yeast-based recipe. They are actually rather light and possess a perfect amount of crunch on the exterior. Not super heavy and dense like some other cake doughnuts of the world.  

So far, we've tried a handful --
Lemon
Cinnamon Sugar
Glazed
Peanut Butter
Strawberry

By far, the glazed wins every single time. It's just so perfect and easy. Eat them warm or after a few hours and they retain the same flavor and texture. I'm sure heating them in the oven wouldn't be a bad call either. 

Very impressed with these guys. Their varieties of doughnuts will certainly win over tons of local Dilworth eating talent and I'm sure we'll plan on many a visit in the near future. 

Welcome to the 'hood, Duck Donuts!"}
{"text":"We were at Carolwinds last Saturday... Sunday morning I was craving for some doughnuts. I went straight to \"Yelp\" I found Duck Donuts. 
The morning was cloudy and depressing. As soon as I bite my first \"Duck Donut\" it was like heaven . If you feel like having a bad day or want some super doper donuts... You have to stop by here at Duck Donuts in 1710 Kenilworth Ave Charlotte North Carolina. I will always come here every time I visit Beautiful Charlotte, North Carolina."}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner/manager is very welcoming and friendly. Our favorite combination is the maple bacon."}
{"text":"So, why did it take me driving to Charlotte from Atlanta to finally taste a Duck Donut? I have a Duck Donuts a few miles from my home and I've had it bookmarked for several months but never visited or tasted them until in Charlotte, that's all thanks to a friend that helped me get my doughnut fix this weekend. 

This is a franchise and they have locations across the U.S., primarily along the East Coast but two locations in CA. This one is located Kenilworth Commons in Charlotte and they're open 7 days a week. The first shop opened in Duck, NC; that's where the name comes from, for those that are curious, like me. 

All of the donuts are made-to-order and my friend ordered a variety dozen. The famous Duck Donut is a freshly-made vanilla cake donut that you coat, top and drizzle as you wish. The donuts are warm, delicious, and just the way you like them according to their website.
Of course I couldn't try all 12 so I tried 4 (I cut the doughnuts in quarters) ;). I tried blueberry icing,  cinnamon sugar,  strawberry icing and one more that I can't remember, my bad! I do remember that I enjoyed each cake donut and the toppings/frosting on each, they were soft and yummy. It reminded me of the doughnuts I had as a kid. So, I have to agree with the website, they were delicious."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had in my life. They're always warm & literally melt in your mouth every single time."}
{"text":"Great concept with a sensational resulting product.  Really unique and MOST satisfactory."}
{"text":"Great concept, good location, but very busy at times. The guy that took my order messed it up but everyone makes mistakes, right? The ordering process was a bit tricky... I didn't realize it until I had gotten back to the office, but no biggie, I was buying for a work event. The idea of hot donuts sounds awesomely great! However, they should actually taste good.  These donuts leave something to be desired. How about concentrating on different cake batters instead of sugary, artificial flavored and artificial colored toppings? I would just love it if Charlotte for once, could get some life in the business of baking, its definitely lacking here."}
{"text":"I first discovered these amazing cake doughnuts on a trip to the beach in Duck, NC. I'm so excited to have them here in Charlotte even though it's quite a haul from my neck of the woods to Dilworth. 

Fresh, warm cake doughnuts are made while you watch in anticipation. They smell heavenly and are delectable even plain.  With the infinite array of toppings, they are amazing. It's best to fill out an order sheet and customize away. All toppings are included in the price. 

Simple cinnamon sugar--unbeatable. 
Dunked in chocolate--decadent. 
Topped in zesty lemon glaze--OMG!  

The toppings can be combined:
Vanilla drizzled with chocolate. 
Lemon drizzled with strawberry. 
Chocolate coated in coconut.  
The possibilities are endless. . .  And you really can't go wrong customizing a doughnut. In the mood for maple bacon, then go for it!

I will be back far too often. This is whole different experience than a Krispy Kreme (which is also amazing). They are almost different food groups."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh - you see the donut cooking while you order. They are custom and made to order. Toppings are delicious but even the bare donut is sweet enough. The crisp outside and soft warm middle. Duck Donuts is definitely the best donuts I have had and I would recommend them to all. The only thing is they need to be eaten fairly quickly, they lose that awesome crisp after they have cooled down."}
{"text":"Made fresh to order donuts! You can customize them however you'd like! They are vanilla cake based, and super soft. I have order \"bulk\" orders many times and I have never been disappointed. Weekend mornings can be a bit busy with a longer line.

{"text":"These are real donuts. Plus they have a breakfast special that includes two donuts and coffee. Their coffee is a high end brew not your normal American diner coffee. If you have young children they will love to watch the donut machine drop the dough into the oil at one end and come out the other end cooked and ready for the topping of your choice. I want one of those machines in my kitchen.
I loved the powdered sugar and the cinnamon sugar donuts of my youth but they also have all the popular new/strange toppings that are currently popular. Go and enjoy a real donut."}
{"text":"One of the best doughnuts in city. Cinnamon sugar and glazed are my fav. Yummyyyyyy..............................."}
{"text":"Went last Saturday.  Line out the door despite the rainy morning.  Donuts were awesome as always and moved fairly quickly.  Friendly service and price is stellar for quality.  French Toast is my fav...wife loves the Reese's.  My wife was pretty disappointed there was no milk in the cooler...she would take off a star for that since she's not a coffee person.  

For $1.20 for a fresh donut MTO with any frosting and topping you want--can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Duck Donuts is such a fun place to come eat for any age! You get to pick all your toppings and glazes and the donuts are made right in front of you and served WARM.  The warmness of these donuts makes you want to devour them all on the spot. I have never had a donut combination I didn't like, but my favorite is the coconut island bliss"}
{"text":"I consider myself a donut connoisseur at this point in my life. Have tried them in multiple states, NYC, Boston, Boca Raton FL, New Haven CT and this place has BY FAR THE BEST DONUTS I have ever tasted. Seriously I cannot emphasis enough how phenomenal these were.

They are fresh donuts, literally made within 1 minute of me ordering, and you get them nice and warm. For other yelpers complaining about how \"difficult\" the menu is to figure out how to order... you probably have a low IQ because it's very simple and everywhere you look in the restaurant there are signs telling you how to order which again is pretty simple, pick your flavor and toppings, pay and wait.

The toppings are fresh and flavorful, definitely not too sweet on anything. They are also extremely reasonably priced for specialty donuts 4 for $5!! 

Staff was sweet, clearly take pride in their work. Definitely a must try place with an awesome concept - I mean really how often do you get to create your own donuts?!"}
{"text":"These donuts are so worth the drive out to get them! They taste so fresh and the price is hard to beat. I absolutely recommend this spot for anyone looking for a donut shop to come to on the regular."}
{"text":"two words: go here

ive been stalking their instagram and practically drooling over how good the donuts look, finally got to try some and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S - always fresh, made to order, lots of crazy varieties. I was a little overwhelmed and would love to see more suggestions of how to put things together - the same personal problem I have at fro-yo places. But, they are up there as some of the best donuts I've ever had, for sure!"}
{"text":"The possibilities are endless and the donuts are melt-in-your-mouth good! I don't usually like cake-y donuts but I really enjoyed these. The staff members I interacted with were so friendly. The guy taking my order was especially patient with me while I tried to decide what combination of glaze/toppings/drizzle I wanted for each donut. He also made suggestions which were helpful. I got a half dozen to share with the family so we cut them all into 4's so we could sample a little from each. My favorite combos were lemon glaze with coconut flakes, blueberry glaze with graham cracker, and vanilla glaze with coconut flakes and raspberry drizzle!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 or 4 times now and I will continue to go back.  The way it works is awesome.  They freshly make the doughnut right in front of you.  You pick a coating, a topping, and then a drizzle and you can do as many as you like for only $1.30/each.  That is a heck of deal.  Even though they are making them as you order they are pretty stinking fast.  I grew up in the south so cake donuts are not something I have been accustomed to but these are really good especially when they are just made and you sit down and eat them in the store.  I am a fan and will continue to go.  Probably my third favorite doughnut spot.  My favorite one is the peanut butter coating with oreo topping and the salted caramel drizzle."}
{"text":"Duck Donuts is absolutely heavenly. I've been getting donuts from their original location in the Outer Banks for years, and I had no idea there was a Charlotte location until very recently. This location did not disappoint! The donuts are very cake-y, which is without a doubt my favorite kind of donut. You order what frosting and topping you want on each donut, and now you can order a drizzle on top of the donut too!

The one downside, as someone who has been to the original location, is the different atmosphere. The original location seems a bit cozier and more welcoming than this location, but the food is just as delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a Krispy Kreme girl at heart. I love a yeast doughnut and I'm not a huge fan of cake doughnuts. But Duck's doughnuts are delicious. They're hot and they're not dry like some cake doughnuts tend to be. You can choose a variety of glazes, toppings and drizzles. I opted for a maple glaze with bacon and salted Carmel drizzle. It was so good with the warmth of the doughnut mixed with the sweet and saltiness of the Maple glaze, bacon and salted Carmel. If I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to stop by and grab a few."}
{"text":"OMG such good, warm, fresh donuts with all kind of frosting and toppings options!!  

I saw that they also offer breakfast egg sandwiches so I'll be going back to try one of those as well."}
{"text":"OMG they have the absolute best donuts I've ever tried. Totally customizable and you can order online. My favorite I tried had loads of crumbled bacon on top! Made fresh to order. Melt in your mouth when they are warm. Don't hesitate to try them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My neighbor brought me a plain iced one . Im not into cake doughnuts that much and it was ok. Guess adding all those toppings make it? Very expensive too Their menu doesnt have prices but on google it does and well I wont pay $$$ for these. I like Dunken doughnuts better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic donut spot. Can get crowded but cranks out the orders quickly. Zebra with coconut is the bomb."}
{"text":"Great doughnuts.  Make sure to get at least half a dozen to try different combinations.  Each one was great and I will definitely be back.

Even good if you bring them home and reheat them"}
{"text":"Like some of the other Yelpers, I'm completely overwhelmed when I walked in. I feel and look like a lost child!! My eyes and body language shows you I'm stress out. Soo many thing to decide. How many, what kind of toppings and what CAN go with what!!! Oh my!! 
After the sweats finally settle down. I ordered the plain chocolate and another lemon with raspberry drizzle.. The staffs seem to push me along pretty quickly.. Not very friendly. I feel like I'm get push along like an assembly line.. and then comes the donuts.. I love the fact that it's hot and melted in your mouth. But I'm not a big fan of cake dough donut.. I'm used to the good ole fashion yeast risen donut. And once it cool down. It's not very good either! I do love their concept. Hot, custom order, and some many options to twist your mind!"}
{"text":"Found by a happy accident.  I used to work at Dunkin Donuts for several years in Ohio.  I love Dunkin Donuts.  :)  But, Duck Donuts are different and just as good.  We got 4 different kinds and liked them all.  I think the grease is a bit different and makes the donuts seem more cakier, crispier and yummier."}
{"text":"The donuts here are pretty good. You can see them being made hot and fresh. I got the chocolate bacon and the bare powdered one. The waiting time is longer but nothing to be impatient about. Friendly cashiers too!"}
{"text":"Was excited when I walked in. It was packed for a Tuesday at 930am. I counted 27 people. Placed my order. You choose your coating, topping and then a drizzle. I got an assortment of what the cashier said was the most popular. Oreo, maple bacon and French toast. Boy did it smell good in there and when I saw them they looked amazing!  First bite and disappointed, totally soggy. Stick to the roof of your mouth soggy. Not sure if this is their normal, I'd hope not. Based on this not a fan. I really thought the kids would really enjoy going on an occasion so they could make their own creations. Kind of like tcby which they love.  $15 ish for a dozen. $15 down the drain, they are going in the trash. If I had tried one there I likely would have ask for a refund."}
{"text":"I cut my teeth as a young professional on coffee and donuts, and lots of them.  Now . . . I look like one, too!  So today, a donut is really a treat and from now on, I'm waddling into Duck D's for whatever qualifies a donut worthy to celebrate!  Really, they are that good.

Tip: Wanna get your kids really wired before school?  Like bouncing off the walls just to tick off their teacher?  You know, for laughs and giggles?!?  Duck Donuts will knock their socks off.  Fantastic recipes."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of cake doughnuts and I'm extremely loyal to their sister, yeast. But that didn't stop me from standing in line on a Saturday morning to try these out. These doughnuts are worth the hype. They are fresh and warm and dipped immediately into your choice of frosting and toppings as soon as you order. The cake is fluffy and soft. These are damn good and well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"They're consistent and delicious. I've tried mixing things up but I always go back to the oreo.

They make their donuts to order so you'll be waiting a few minutes, especially if you order something complicated.

It's worth the price even if they use the same base."}
{"text":"People, these pictures do not do these donuts justice. The pictures are beautiful, but the donuts. The donuts are AH-MAY-ZING!!! The donut is light, sweet and fluffy  and is unlike any donut I've ever had. The staff was super helpful and patient. They have great order forms you can use to speed up the checkout experience. 
I can't wait to come back to north Carolina! Please open a location in atl"}
{"text":"My love for Duck Donuts runs deep. Being a Charlotte girl, I've always loved the donuts that shall not be named, but nothing beats a Duck Donut when you went to the Carolina coast! I love having this slice of heaven in Charlotte. It instantly reminds me of the coast."}
{"text":"Just had my first Duck donut and it was delicious. So many topping combinations to choose from & eating them warm made it even better. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I mean really what is there to say negatively about duck donuts. I have been to this place multiple times and never once I have been disappointed. I was craving something sweet when I realized I hadn't stopped in for a while and boy was I glad I did. I got my regular strawberry glazed with Oreos crumbles on top but got even more excited when I noticed they had a key lime glaze for the spring time. I didn't even know this existed and knew I had to try it. I got the cinnamon sugar donut with key lime drizzle on top (a suggested flavor). It was everything I could ever imagine with amazing flavors and soft dough texture. I will be dreaming about that key lime glaze for a while now"}
{"text":"Excellent donuts and breakfast sandwiches.  Sad for my eating better, because I already want more.  They are delicious so many varieties of donuts.  Made fresh.  They were still warm when we got them.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Small cozy atmosphere.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for donuts, do not come here. 

I ordered half a dozen donuts, a regular coffee, and a toffee iced coffee. First, the customer service was really bad...I had never been here or any Duck Donuts store so I didn't know how the process goes. When I asked the cashier, she wasn't friendly at all, but just told us how it is. That's fine. I paid for my things and got the coffees. First of all, the iced coffee was really disgusting, it straight up tasted like toffee syrup. That's fine, whatever. So I went to order a milk for the donuts...but the cashier did not know what she was talking about. The people in front of me got upset because she gave them the wrong information about MILK...I ignored it because I was super excited for the donuts but they got the order wrong. We ordered a strawberry spring edition, vanilla with Oreo, chocolate with peanut butter and salted caramel, s'mores, blueberry with lemon glaze, and a maple bacon. They put coconut flakes on the chocolate peanut butter...and asked if it was okay? No. Obviously not because we don't like coconut nor did we order it. But I ignored it again because I saw all the great reviews and I was still excited. When we got the donuts, I was ecstatic! They were warm and they smelled good, but oh...they were not donuts. They were cake-like and so disappointing. More than a cake-like donut, they were just cake. The taste did not even compare to a donut and the entire experience was so underwhelming and disappointing. I was also sad because the spring edition just had sprinkles and the chocolate peanut butter was just chocolate with a bunch of peanuts.

If you want REAL donuts and coffee, don't come here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like fresh, hot cake donuts with your choice of toppings?  Really?"}
{"text":"This place is really good and so creative! I'm not a huge donut person and tend to like glaze or sugar donuts, but I was feeling adventurous and wanted to spice it up a bit. I would suggest only eating two donuts for yourself because you will be very full and have a sugar overload. They have so many options and toppings to choose from it's almost overwhelming but in a good way. Definitely kid and family friendly!"}
{"text":"Warm inside. Crowded inside. Service with a smile. Lots of conversation. They make each donut at the time u order it. Everyone is happy. There r so many flavors to choose from. Fast service. What else can u ask for?? 
We got home and they were FRESH and tasted wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I know I wrote a review for this place previously via my phone, but somehow it was lost :(

Last year my aunt was visiting for the holidays and we had been running around all day. She said she wanted something sweet, so I did a quick yelp search and Duck Donuts popped up. I told her everyone kept raving about it so why not give it a shot. I am so very glad I did!! I got their cinnamon toast crunch donut and a chocolate dipped donut to take back for my brother, along with their holiday blend coffee. Everything was amazing, and the best part is the donuts are cooked to order. Nothing beats a hot fresh donut, it's the very reason people make a run on Krispy Creme when the hot sign comes on. Here at Duck Donuts you get that with every order... it's what I imagine heaven is like!! I was so impressed with them that I decided for International Women's Day I would bring in Duck Donuts for the morning session at work instead of Dunkin (Dunkin is right next to my office). I was able to pre-order, and schedule it for an early enough time that I didn't have to fight traffic. I arrived a little early, and they went ahead and got my ordered cooked, and even loaded them and the coffee into my car for me. FYI if Duck Donuts ever decides to add delivery to their business plan someone in my office would order daily... we'll all be roly poly but we'd be happy haha. 

The donuts are delicious, and the service is amazing, so I encourage everyone to give them a shot."}
{"text":"My first visit & I will definitely return! I love the consistency & texture of their doughnut. I had the Maple Bacon doughnut & OMG!! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, warm, cake donuts!! What's not to love??! The line was out the door at opening... That's how good they are."}
{"text":"The concept of made to order donuts is brilliant. I visited with my boyfriend and we each selected three custom created flavors. It was very cool to see the environment and watch the staff create your masterpiece. Somewhat like an ice cream sundae. 

A few not so negatives, the donuts are cake donuts. If you prefer old fashioned, this is a bit of a tricky place for you. The staff seemed less than thrilled to make so many orders come to life. For many, you can tell it was just a job. Frankly, you can see past that if they don't screw up what you order. 

All the donuts will come warm and by warm, I mean hot. The kids will certainly need to let these cool for a few before digging in."}
{"text":"Um, Hi.  My name is Sydney and I don't like doughnuts.

Well, I didn't like doughnuts.  I still don't think I like doughnuts.  I'm not sure what happened.

What the duck was that?  A doughnut or a magical piece of heaven dipped in lemon icing and coconut flakes?   I literally cannot even right now, it's too basic... but the pumpkin...and the chocolate chips... and the hot cinnamon sugar.

(Heavy Breathing)

(More Heavy Breathing)

This place is entertaining and converts the doughnut non-believers with it's hot and ready customizable doughnutty goodness.  

Bring the family, bring a date, bring your best friends dog if it gets you there.  Duck Donuts is the new black."}
{"text":"Duck's Donuts is donut heaven! I have been here several times and my company also brings them in for breakfast. You absolutely can not go wrong with any combination. Just a note, this was my favorite spot when I was pregnant too lol. Want to talk about convenience, it's 5 minutes away from the Baby & Co birthing center (#issasetup lol). Maple bacon donut, don't knock it til you try it..sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for a day and was looking forward to checking them out. Place was cool, staff was nice, and the coffee wasn't bad. Didn't realize it was a build your own donut concept which I'm not a fan of. Donuts just fall apart being so hot and heavy. 
Nice staff, just wouldn't recommend the donuts ."}
{"text":"Good place for that treat you're craving anytime during the day. They are busiest in the mornings so plan ahead and have your order ready. It's pretty inconsistent when it comes to quality and presentation since there are different donut artists each time but it all taste great at the end. Go with the 1/2 dozen or dozen for the best bang for your buck. Wish they open up a spot in the Lake Norman Area soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I especially love their blueberry glaze and their lemon glaze. Their donuts are a cake donut and always taste fresh and are fluffy without tasting like air while also not being dense. The outside is perfectly crisp-- they are pretty much the perfect donut!"}
{"text":"The donuts here taste delicious!! So fresh,I like the different varieties they have that you can choose from! You can make your own donut.."}
{"text":"The hype was worth a look, but it's not something I would go out of my way for. The premise is you go in and order your donuts to your specification. The selection of toppings and glazes are good - everything from indulgent peanut butter and chocolate to lemon and raspberry. The only thing that I wish they had is different types of donuts besides just regular cake. A chocolate , lemon ,maybe even orange flavor would be worthy of more stars. 
The other thing is they are great hot/fresh - but reheating them (even following the directions on the box) just loses some of the magic. 
Worth a stop, but not somewhere I would visit regularly."}
{"text":"Couple donuts from Duck's and sugar rush is sure to kick in !! Maple bacon donut is the bomb, chocolate coconut donut is the second bomb !!
Super fresh, soft, warm, sweet and delicious donuts prepared right in front of your eyes.  To be honest I didn't realize these were cake batter donuts until I read some of the reviews here.  Love the taste.  
A small place in a strip mall, always a little bit crowd, majority of them are kids running around the shop.  They also have couple tables inside to dine in and offer coffee as well."}
{"text":"The big draw to this establishment is that you get hot freshly made custom donuts. These are yummy cake donuts that have a variety of custom toppings to choose from. These donuts melt in your mouth. Caution, very messy to eat while you are driving home with these little jewels."}
{"text":"This place has the best doughnuts I have ever had!!!   I have had the maple glazed bacon and the bacon is not bacon bits, it is for real. The doughnuts are made as you order and you have to eat them with a fork. Everyone in there is like scraping the frosting off the bottom of their boxes it is that good. I've had maple bacon with sales caramel glaze, pumpkin pie, and chocolate covered with toasted coconut.  Everyone in there is so excited and pumped to get their doughnuts!  I wish they were closer to me."}
{"text":"The most delicious donuts ever!!!! Made fresh right in front of you! Try the Reese's, Almond Joy, and French Toast!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review brief because the quality is exactly what you would expect at the East Blvd location, which is outstanding! So glad they set up shop in Rose Commons. 

The store itself has the same feel of any of the other Duck Donuts shops but a bit more spacious and of course a newer finish. Clean tables, clean restrooms, and clean service counters! Don't discount seeing clean service counter, I have seen countless counter-service restaurants that have a great atmosphere minus a dirty surface to serve food on, come on man! 

Today I got the blueberry pancake donut (blueberry and maple glaze) as well as the Maple Bacon w/ Salted Caramel. I never noticed but the blueberry glaze has real specs of blueberry, a fresh addition to the morning sweets run! Both were perfect, warm crisp donut with a rich, complex topping; pure bliss. 

Can't say enough how this is a great location for them, glad there's more space in the store than East Blvd 'cause you guys are going to need it!"}
{"text":"If you're a regular in the Dilworth or South End neighborhood and haven't been to Duck Donuts, you don't know what you're missing! They serve hot, made to order custom donuts. When I say custom, I mean anyway you want it. How about a vanilla glaze with coconut flakes and raspberry drizzle? Don't be shy, they cater to your preferences.

If you know you're going to place a big order with a lot of different flavored donuts, go ahead and grab an order sheet on the stand as soon as you walk in and fill it out. That way you can hand it to the cashier when you're ready and keep the line moving. Make sure to grab whatever they're sampling near the service counter as well!

First time here? My suggestion is the crowd favorite Maple-Bacon with Salted Caramel Drizzle. A bit more plain but my favorite is the Cinnamon Sugar with Raspberry Drizzle. You really can't go wrong with any combination you choose. You even get to watch them make it right in front of you!

Can you get cheaper donuts in Charlotte? Maybe. But after you've found your favorite at Duck, why would you want to go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Best donuts hands down, I goto the one Cary, NC all the time! Love the Bacon & Maple!"}
{"text":"YUM!! Duck is a special little place. It isn't like the other donut shops that have pre-made donuts sitting neatly on racks waiting for you. Duck rolls out warm donuts fresh and glazes them  after you order them. This ensures a fresh, delicious donut. I recommend the maple bacon, strawberry bacon, cinnamon roll and almond joy. Want to take a whole bunch home? Make sure you pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds before you eat them!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got an order of 6 donuts to go and I was super pleased. We tried the strawberry, maple, peanut butter and cinnamon sugar flavors. They were delicious, all of them! They are simple, delicious and classic donuts. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place but with it being 45 minutes away we hadn't been able to try it. I wanted to do something nice for my kids teachers so I drove down to Duck Donuts and it was so worth the trip. Oh my these donuts were so delicious!! The maple bacon were sent straight from heaven!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much.  Maybe I waited too long to eat them, but they were just kind of like regular donuts.  Not out of this world great and a little pricey.  One thing that I can say is that they weren't too sweet.  They definitely looked like they were going to be knock-your-socks off, goo-ball type of sweet, but they were actually very pleasant tasting."}
{"text":"The best donuts. The maple bacon is my favorite. If you are in the Charlotte area, go check this place out."}
{"text":"Freshly made and delicious. The service was incredible. They walked me through the process and flavor combos. Super friendly amd helpful."}
{"text":"Mmmm what a treat! Duck Donuts's freshly made donuts were just what I needed on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The donuts are made to order and are only $1.20 so you know I couldn't settle for just one. 

Naturally, I ordered a half dozen: 

1. Glaze with coconut 
2. Orange glaze 
3. Peanut butter glaze
4. Strawberry glaze with rainbow sprinkles
5. Maple glaze with bacon
6. The daily special- cinnamon sugar with vanilla glaze

Wow these were awesome! My favorite was the glaze with coconut. It was delectable! The donuts are soft, but also a little crispy around the edges. I liked the fact that you could essentially build your own donut. You can mix and match the glaze (ex: orange glaze with vanilla glazed on top= orange dreamcicle donut). The only downside is that they only have one batter- cake. So don't expect to get a chocolate donut here. 

Ps. This is also a grab and go location. There are only 3 2 person tables inside with about 6 bar stools along the window, however there are benches outside."}
{"text":"Go ahead, I dare you! Just try walking through the doors of Duck Donuts without smiling. It's nearly impossible! Personally, I felt a little like one of the kids touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory as I stood in line on my first visit. I could almost hear the tune playing in my head, \"Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka.\"

As I tried to make sense of things, one-by-one, giddy people placed their orders in front of me as if mesmerized by some strange spell. Nearly half, like myself, needed to be instructed how to order and what their options were (which at first, seemed daunting.) You order, pay and wait anxiously for your number to be called while your yellow cake donuts are created fresh - fried, coated, dipped, sprinkled, topped and/or drizzled - on the assembly line behind a glass partition.

Important Note: You will need a napkin to wipe away your inevitable drool if you choose to observe yours made. Be warned though, watching increases your wait time.

Making a choice can be difficult. I had intended to just order two - their top sellers: Bacon & Maple Glazed and Cinnamon Sugar - and yet what came out if my mouth was something totally different - those two plus for four more. Hey, it makes sense I rationalized, you get a discount on a half dozen!

The Bacon & Maple was pretty incredible as was the Cinnamon Sugar. (For the record, I had only half of each.) The Lemon glaze was a little too sweet because of either the confectionary sugar dusting our due to the fact that it was the third one I tried. The other three were the vanilla glaze, the chocolate covered with vanilla drizzle and one just like that covered in coconut and peanuts. Yes, my middle aged stomach was a little nauseas afterward (and a little now just recalling it.)

The coffee was just okay as was the service. The sanitary rating was a 94. Overall, it's a fun place with good donuts; however, it will still not not help me break my Krispy Kreme addiction. I will return though but next time I'll take my kids. Now if I could just get that darn Willy Wonka tune out of my head!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite line in a movie was by Danny DiVito in the movie \"you gotta be hungry to eat a donut? I never heard of such a thing\"
Well this place is a big let down. You can put a $3000 saddle on a donkey and he won't win the Kentucky Derby.
They have one type of cake base donut. It really doesn't give you anything to bite into, too airy for me. Then they dress it with all kinds of toppings. I'm donut purest, cinnamon, chocolate, powdered sugar and glaze. If the donut can't pass the test with basics forget it.
It's way over priced! Don't complain about the price of gas and buy a $1.50 two bite donut. 
My advice- Entenmann's always goes on sale buy a couple of boxes and pig out."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! They technically only have 1 kind of donut, but you can customize any way you want, which is pretty awesome. They have a list of favorites you can choose from, or you can customize with a frosting, topping, and drizzle. My son's personal fave is  strawberry frosting with sprinkles and a chocolate drizzle. The maple bacon definitely doesn't disappoint either! Service is quick and friendly. My only wish is that they could make filled doughnuts. A girl can dream."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! I grew up eating them at their first location in Duck, NC and I am so happy they opened this location in Huntersville! Amazing company!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked up, we knew this place would be delicious.  There were people on a sidewalk bench, people at a tiny table, people along the sidewalk and leaning on their cars in the parking lot, all holding small brown boxes of doughnuts and sporting large, sugary smiles.  We walked through their front door and were greeted with a lengthy line and a number of people waiting around for their order, but we soon saw that this would prove to not be an issue.  The line moved along very quickly.  The cashier was extremely helpful in assisting my friend and I make a selection based upon her favorites as we had never been there before.  After deciding on two doughnuts each, we paid, were given our receipt with our order number, and found ourselves waiting for our order while watching the doughnut production process behind a transparent sneeze-guard.  It was amazing to watch the process from dough to fried doughnut ring to decorated doughnut and made the anticipation for our treats heighten.  

We waited a very short amount of time, and it was nice to be entertained in the process by the doughnut making and looking to see what everyone else had ordered that we barely even heard our order number being called.  We grabbed our brown box of treasures and dug in.  Soft, sweet, and everything a doughnut should be!  It was one of our toughest decisions of the day to not go in and get another!

I would highly recommend these treats to anyone, and I feel that their service was so friendly and fast, even a dozen or more doughnuts would be a timely feat for this crew!  Thank you guys for a great and delicious experience."}
{"text":"Duck Donuts was the biggest culinary disappointment of 2015 for me. Why am I giving them 4 stars then you ask? Because it's not them it's me. Unfortunately I am in the yeast risen donuts camp and I refuse to acknowledge cake donuts as a legitimate donut.

That said I still really enjoyed their fresh out of the fryer cake donuts. Though some of the glazes were a bit too sweet for me such as the maple glaze the salty toppings help curb some of that sugar. Their store employees are helpful and the place is clean and no nonsense. Get your donuts, get your coffee and get to work.

A charming concept that may bring me back if I am ever in a donut emergency and there is no yeast risen donut option around."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the strawberry glazed. Great for kids because they can watch as the donuts made."}
{"text":"The donuts come fresh, flavorful and yummy! I had the strawberry & a plain glazed and they were absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a new \"made to order\" donuts shop were you design your own donuts or choose from theirs.

I ordered half a dozen of theirs. They make them all fresh. They're warm, toasty and cozy. The key is to eat these right away, they're outstanding when they're warm and good when they're cold.

It's located in a new fancy styled European plaza across from Whole Foods by South hills village. 

They tried to TRICK me when they built this plaza because there is a whole chain of stores BEHIND the plaza and that is where Duck Donuts is."}
{"text":"They weren't busy, I walked in was the only person in line. They had a good special for two doughnuts and a coffee for $4. The void toner service was alright. I told the lady I had never been and she gave me recommendations. I got the cin sugar and chocolate dipped with coconut flakes. They were both warm and tasty. I recommend this place for a quick cheap spot for some tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"7/29/17 Is my last visit (I can't)! I really really wanted to love this place but when I saw the employee use the cloth to clean with then turn around and wipe her gloves on the same cloth while creating my donut designs... NASTY, GROSS!"}
{"text":"I went to Duck Donuts for National Donut Day!! The cinnamon sugar donut was off da chain! It was warm and moist, reminded me of a funnel cake! In the past I've had the maple bacon donut which is very good! Best donuts in the city!"}
{"text":"Sooooo my co-work got me two donuts from here. I have heard people say how good they are..WELL LET ME SAY ITS FACTS!!! ALL FACTS! the donuts were sooooo soooo good!! 

Why just 4stars?  Because see I did not go inside, I was told to go online and pick what I wanted on my donuts. Well I couldn't find all of the toppings they offer on the website. Which made me picking my own personal donut hard. I ended up picking one of their most popular donut."}
{"text":"At long last, I have found the pinnacle of doughnut making. Duck Donuts has mastered the art and stole the crown from what I had given to Krispy Kreme many moons ago. These are the best donuts alive ever had. Let me explain why...  I did not know that they serve the donuts \"fresh\" - meaning warm and made-to-order.  I needed this all my life and had no idea that I did!  I am a fan of the cakey type donut.  Donuts aren't meant to be flimsy crumby things, but decadent morsels.  KK makes a delicious airy donut that I can get served warm if I time it right, but Duck Donuts is always has the \"hot sign\" on if you know what I mean.  You pick the toppings and style of your donuts when you place your order and the literally make it to your specifications immediately after.  I thought the maple bacon would be my favorite, but it was tied with the Reeses one on the scale of awesomeness.  Both of them a 10/10.  My only recommendation is that they add a few more choices for icings and toppings. The ones they have are great and work well, but if I came here often enough, I could see myself wanting to switch it up before long.  I like that service was with a smile and that the prices were appropriate.  Too bad I am cursed to live in a state that only believes in Dunkin. But whenever I am in the Charlotte area, I guarantee this place will always get a visit from me"}
{"text":"They are not worth it........ all the same donut....... thought would be better heard about all these good donuts a waste of money when I ask if you have a chocolate donut and you say yes I am thinking a chocolate donut not plain with chocolate icing and a blueberry donut not plain and blueberry icing I was so disappointed will never be back I ended up throwing one away not wasting m calories on something not worth it"}
{"text":"These donuts.


THESE DONUTS.


Fresh, warm, wonderful donuts. How could you not love this place? It tools us awhile to narrow down our choices but we got a few different flavors and they were all fantastic. I see several visits in our near future (and subsequently to the gym)."}
{"text":"Oh how I have craved these donuts recently.  Knowing that I wouldn't be getting them until a return visit to the Outer Banks usually made me sad.  But lo and behold, they started franchising and expanding their reach for people to enjoy.

If you've never had Duck Donuts, I feel for you.  Seriously, they are some of the best donuts you can have.  And this is coming from a person who usually steers clear of donuts.  These ones seem different to me.

The best way to describe Duck Donuts to you is that it's the Subway of donuts.  Yeah, I know that sounds generic, but it is what it is.  You go in, order the quantity you want and proceed down the line.  You, and your children if you have them, can watch the donuts go through the process of being a simple cake based dough to the rings of delight.  Then comes the fun part, toppings.  There are a multitude of selections.  Last time I was here I told them to surprise me with my dozen and they did not disappoint.  

I was a little greedy while I was here as well.  On top of my dozen I ordered I got an extra doughnut to go, just so I could eat it on my drive.  They gave me a maple bacon one and was I in heaven.  That sweet and salty combination on that cakey dough was the closest to perfection that you can get from a doughnut shop.  

It made me happy to know that I didn't have to make a day's trip to get these doughnuts again.  It is definitely a welcomed addition to the area for me."}
{"text":"My first Duck Donuts experience was amazing! It's left me wanting more, and more, and more. I will admit, walking in and looking at everything left me feeling overwhelmed and confused. Make your own donuts, pick your own toppings, what to choose, what to get? But here's what you need to know: all donuts come with the same base donut (which is absolutely amazing!) Than you pick the \"glaze\" (chocolate, cinnamon sugar, vanilla, etc) and than add one topping (sprinkles, chocolate drizzle, powdered sugar). Donuts are ready in minutes, fresh and hot (easy to devour within seconds). 

If nothing else, ask for recommendations from the cashiers or select one of their \"pre-selected\" options. Once I tasted the donut, I was sold! It's so delicious and inspires you to return with creativity!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful, and efficient staff. I got a cinnamon sugar donut and a lemon glazed donut with raspberry drizzle, both were delicious. Seems to be a very popular place!"}
{"text":"Have never been there, but have had the doughnuts at work several times.  They are the best I've tasted in town by far.  I've never been a huge fan of Dunkin's soulless donuts and these put them to shame."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to pre-made donut shops.   First, this place was only open 2 days before I showed up on day 3.   Busy busy.  Great service.  Ordering was unusual as you design each donut you want.  That seems it would get easier with repeat visits I'm sure.  Taste is pretty good, but each donut has the same base, a vanilla cake then they go to a Subway store concept where they add your coating and toppings of your choosing.  You actually mark an order form in line and they work from that detail to make your donuts. 

Pricing seems high but you're paying for freshness and ability to make your own tasty donut.  

Definitely a crowd favorite and will do well in Huntersville!   Worth a trip.  Pricing makes me give a 4-star."}
{"text":"Nom. That's the only word I really need to write. This place has some of the best donuts like, ever. Always slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. Served hot and fresh. Their toppings and combinations are delish and I make myself sick every time I go here because I can't order just one! Their coffee is good too. I wish they had more seating because they get wicked busy on weekends, but overall, great place to satisfy your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got two breakfast sandwiches and a s'mores donut. So yummy. I now see why everyone goes here. Loved it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a fun experience to order your own donuts made fresh. We had three:  strawberry icing, cinnamon sugar and maple bacon. They were all so good, tasted almost like cake. Unique and a must try!"}
{"text":"Great donuts, but service was painfully slow. Did not enjoy watching what seemed to be a manager chit-chatting with customers while the employees struggled filling our order and the few of us had to wait what felt like triple the expected time."}
{"text":"Love, love, love these donuts hot and fresh. Perfectly fluffy cake donuts with any combo of icings and toppings your heart desires. We love the maple icing best with peanuts for me and sprinkles for my husband. Eat them warm if you can!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!!!! Coconut with Vanilla Icing was great...Oreo with Vanilla Icing was a close second. We will be back soon...very, very soon."}
{"text":"Donuts are pretty good, a good deal for what you get. The process is simple, you write down what you want and how many. All the donuts are delicious and taste even better."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's way better than peace love and little donuts. I like that these are regular size donuts as well. It's a great idea that they have order forms you can fill out prior to going makes it a lot easier since the possibilities are endless. I will be back in 2 weeks when the novelty wares off and try their duck donut sandwich lol."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I have had these donuts before while on vacation in the Outer Banks and boy am I excited a shop opened up here in Charlotte.  These donuts are bursting with flavor.  Really rich, cakey flavor.  Don't miss the Reese's (dipped in peanut butter and drizzled with chocolate) and the maple icing with bacon bits on top.  WOW"}
{"text":"When I heard about this place called \"Duck Donuts\" while visiting my sister in Charolette. I thought. What's so special about this place. I was sooooo wrong. This place is heavenly. For one. I was a fool for mistaking it for just another donut place.  The donuts are so delish here. I had two!!!  They were so warm and soft. Not like any other place I've been. I thought there's no was this town has better desserts then NY where I'm from. Uh. Wrong. Best I've had ever!!!! The batter is has to have magic in it lol. The taste is soft buttery and melts with every bite. I'm so tempted to book a flight back. Simply because I need a strawberry Duck Donut with frosting and sprinkles lol. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Ehhh...nothing special. It's cool you can pick from different glazes and they have several flavors but the doughnut isn't that great. Very cake like and less like a real doughnut. If you like cake-ish doughnuts then you'll probably like Duck's, but overall I'd rather have Krispy Kreme any day."}
{"text":"Wow. Melt in your mouth, made-to-order, warm  donuts with the perfect icing. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy!.....We got a mixture of donuts:  Maple-Bacon, Sunrise, Chocolate with Caramel Drizzle, and Vanilla with Sprinkles.....Every donut was more tasty than the next.....Great service as well (Katie was very patient since we were first-timers)"}
{"text":"Great donuts! I don't usually eat donuts but I had to try these since they seemed so special. We got a dozen which included mint icing with chocolate sprinkles (specialty flavor), raspberry glazed, cinnamon roll, vanilla icing with Oreo, and peanut butter chocolate. I don't know which one my favorite was. They were all so good!"}
{"text":"Not your chain store donuts for sure. Ducks Donuts is much like a mom and pops operation, they make their donuts fresh on the spot from small batches according to customer demand. They are made plain from yellow cake batter and then you can choose from different glazes and toppings to coat them. You are guaranteed to get your donuts warm to the touch which in my opinion is what adds to the wonderful experience of tasting fresh donuts."}
{"text":"A donut is a donut, is a cake, is a pancake. (A tribute to my favorite scene from Girl, Interrupted.)

I successfully avoided donuts for 6 months, only to be taken down 2wks ago in one fell swoop during an intense 2 day event where unlimited free donuts were available. Returned to Charlotte and haven't slowed down. That 'famine-feast' thing I guess.

So, Duck Donuts. Mentioned to the cheerful woman at the counter it was my first time. She gave me the run down (which of course I quietly already knew, being an informed yelper) and it was showtime. Despite the warnings of excessive oiliness from other reviews, ordered both a maple & a chocolate coconut. She spied my donut lust, so offered at no charge one that came out too small to sell. Hell f***ing yeah. Chose vanilla.

While I awaited my order, dove in to the gift. Warm, moist, pleasing. The other two arrived, and the maple RULED. At one point, I felt like I was eating hot pancakes. Thick & cakey.

I did observe something, which is more of a note to management than anything else. The card machine was down, so cardholders were asked to leave their card numbers for processing later. One particular patron was visibly uncomfortable with this arrangement but agreed. The nice woman at the counter did try to run the transaction several times, but the system remained stubborn. Thinking the woman was just buying 1 donut, I began to offer to pay, but she had a whole box and I only had $3 cash left. The woman even doubled back before she left and asked the clerk to ensure her card info would be destroyed. All I could think was \"just give her the da*n donuts!\". I mean, what, it would have set them back, what, $12??? Plus, the store was closing in 15min anyway. The woman was clearly concerned, and a man eventually came out from back, who seemed managerial. It would have been an enormous act of customer appreciation and bred tremendous brand loyalty to just give her the donuts at no charge, thank her for her patience, and apologize for the delay. 

After the 2.5 donuts I ate, did feel slightly nauseous. Only one next time."}
{"text":"What a great idea -- customized doughnuts. Why haven't I had this before?

Duck Donuts offers customized donuts and a few other things (e.g., coffee). I got a maple covered doughnut with peanuts. I loved it. I also tried a simple, bare doughnut, which was good too. This is a great place for kids or a quick stop with your date. Every doughtnut is made just seconds before it's served.

The one downside is that the doughnut base is always the same. In other words, you can't get a blueberry cake doughnut or a sourcream doughnut, which are my favorites. Still, their doughnut base is delicious, and you can do a lot with it."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time to see what it was like (I've been to the one in King of Prussia previously). They have cake donuts which are made right in front of you. Tons of options, they have suggestions though if you want to get creative you can do pretty much whatever you want as far as toppings. I just got two donuts, priced at $1.60 a piece I believe, I think the price per donut is cheaper if you get a 1/2 dozen or full dozen. Maybe a little steep for a donut but it's absolutely worth it, these are more than just your average donut. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"When you walk into Duck Donuts it is pretty overwhelming if it's your first time there. There's not really good signage on what to do and where to go. And there isn't a employee at the door to greet you and show you the ropes. Since Duck Donuts is not your typical donut place where the donuts are already pre-made and on display, I would highly suggest they have an employee by the door to show people how to order.
I love the concept of being able to create your own donuts, I don't know of any other donut shop around the city that is like that. When you get your donuts you can't always tell which donut is which. I wish there was a way they could label each donut so you know what's what, maybe using a little flag they could label each donut. 
Also, because the donuts are served warm half of the toppings seem to melt right off before you get a chance to eat it. So you end up having to scrape the box to get half of your toppings.
Aside from those issues (which could come with the fact that they're a brand new restaurant) their donuts are fantastic! I'll definitely be eating at Duck Donuts again..and probably more times than I'd like to admit! :)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Duck Donuts given all the recommendations by others when I moved here. My visit was a disappointment.

It is a cake based donut that seems to be fried in oil.. this ruins the texture of the donut and allows the donut to retain a lot of the oil! I couldn't hold the donut without it crumbling and falling apart.

I ordered a dozen donuts so I could I try as many flavors as possible! I came to the realization that there was only one flavor but many different \"decorations;\" they all taste of oil and sugar! It was extremely difficult to pinpoint most of the flavors! So much so I started blindfolding people in the parking lot and having them try a donut and tell me the flavor. The consensus was that no one could taste anything but sugar and oil..


2/5 because the prices were at least attractive.

Conclusion: I won't be back, nor recommend, and will continue to look for the best donuts in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Busy place... The doughnuts are amazing. You get to create your own pretty much. It stays busy but they come out pretty quick. There is a few places to sit and eat. I recommend trying it at once."}
{"text":"Fresh, made to order donuts? Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Good, but not to die for. They are the best donuts in town, but very sweet and very rich. Not a bad thing depending on who you are. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Customer service isn't amazing. However, the superb donuts make up for the lack of great service.

I ordered the maple and bacon donut. I could only take two bits for fear of gaining 10 lbs just by eating a whole one. But it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh! Light cake donuts! Worth every penny and the 25 min drive. I had the zebra and cinnamon roll they were both delicious!"}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a donut snob (if that exists ) and these are the BEST!! My absolute favorite is the French toast donut and I love how they are hot and made to order. My husband also loves the maple bacon but an underrated flavor is the lemon icing with powdered sugar and coconut. My only complaint is I wish they were open late night like reigning donuts!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  I hate that I have found this place!  It's soooo good.  Seriously cake batter donuts?!   It's too much...and all the different varieties?!  Who do they think they are?? Summer is like next week and I have no self control!  I am however a simple gal and my fave is the glazed.  So light and heavenly.  It's difficult to have just one and also wait long enough to not burn my mouth....yes that's right people!  They serve them fresh, hot and made to order!  The upside is they are located near a yoga studio so why not treat yourself after a class?  I bought two dozen to a neighbors' party and asked the duck server to mix it up with a nice variety.  Needless to say my neighbors were cursing me and thanking me at the same time and the fan favorite was definitely the maple bacon but I don't think anyone was disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to go to Duck Donuts after reading some of the reviews. Not because the reviews were bad, they're amazing! Rather because I am NOT a cake donut-eater. I love all the airy, fluffy, chewy goodness of yeast donuts and how you can eat a dozen and make room for one more!

All that being said...

I'm a total convert. Let her eat cake! I have seen the light, and it's covered in icing and sprinkles.

What works for Duck Donuts is the density, or lack thereof, of their cake donut. Their donuts still have that chewy mouth-feel of a yeast donut, yet are substantial enough to hold up to some crazy icings, toppings, and drizzles. And crazy they are! I ordered a donut with peanut-butter icing, chocolate sprinkles, and salted caramel drizzle. Take that Krispy Kreme! 

The flavors were delicious, the coffee was hot, the service was attentive, but it was the glazed donut that really took the cake. Bliss..."}
{"text":"Great donuts, MADE TO ORDER! They taste so fresh and delicious. I hope one day they add mire toppings. I will return. Best donuts I've had in CLT."}
{"text":"I love donuts and have been meaning to check this place out for a while. I finally stopped in with a friend this morning. 

We ordered a dozen donuts of various flavors. I liked how they make them for you and come out hot. They were so good! Light and fluffy, not too heavy. Compared to peace love and little donuts, I thought the quality of the actual donut itself was much better. The coffee was also very good. 

You can order single donuts, by the dozen, or even a \"bucket\". The store was small inside, so it could be challenging to eat them there if it's busy. But I would definitely recommend! They also appear to work with a lot of charities, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's too bad all these little donut places weren't around before I had to really watch calories closely. I got two to take home to split with Bryan and warmed them up per the directions. I'd love to try one freshly made sometime, though. Great donuts and they allow you to customize the toppings, which is super cool."}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh, hot cake donuts.  Select one or many toppings all for one low price.
Left with warm deliciousness in the tummy.
Will return for certain."}
{"text":"The best donuts I have ever had!!! Will definitely be back for more and soon. These are made to order and come out hot and fresh. The place is small and gets packed but they do a great job of getting you in and out. Not really any place to sit and eat which sucks but they were still warm when we got home, 20 minutes later! Go try this place!"}
{"text":"Great if you like cakey doughnuts (donuts?))??) 
I don't even like doughnuts generally but if someone were to force me to eat a donut and I had the opp to choose where said donut was made, this would be the place."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, my visit was on a Thursday at about 2:00 in the afternoon.  The place was almost empty except for a mom and kids waiting for their donuts.  There were plenty of employees standing around.  2 were even ready to take my family's order.  There are lots of choices for icings and toppings.  Unfortunately, there is only one choice for the donut, vanilla cake.  So if you're a fan of chocolate cake donuts or raised donuts this is not the place for you.  That being said, the vanilla cake donut was fresh but not warm.  We all ordered something different, I had the blueberry icing with sprinkles.  It was pretty good.  
They have a few tables inside.  We did sit down and have our donuts there.  The tables were all dirty.  The floors had a combination of sprinkles, crumbs, and even a part of someone's donut from earlier.  It was a mess.  The trash can was full.  I understand that they are new and probably don't have the logistics worked out yet.  
But one of my daughter's mentioned something that she learned from her very boss..\"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.\"  Words to live by."}
{"text":"Bacon makes everything better. Get the bacons topped donuts here and you'll be addicted!"}
{"text":"Donuts are absolutely delicious!! I will take these over Krispy Kreme any day! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I normally don't like donuts but the soft, cake like consistency with the sweetness of the maple glaze and saltiness of crispy bacon (and some coconut flakes for extra flavor) had me drooling and lucky my fingers before I noticed I'd scarfed up the whole donut. Super good!"}
{"text":"Loving the donuts at Duck Donuts!! So many to choose from. First time here going to have to visit again."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick and delish. These were melt in  your mouth good. I went out of my way to get these donuts for my operations guys while visiting--they are from Charlotte and had never had them. They will now be customers. These are so fun--they have SO many flavors. I would recommend the pumpkin and cinnamon and sugar. The donuts come out hot, so if you are transporting far make sure to get one to eat on the way so you can enjoy the hot melt in your mouth experience. 

They also offer coffee with a free re-fill--however, I did not get this so I cannot attest to if this was truck stop coffee or local coffee. There is not much seating in this place so I would plan to take them to-go. There was bar seating but it was only 5 seats (I think) and was full when I was there. 

For me, this place ranks top of the donut places I have ever been to. I wish there was one in my home town."}
{"text":"Fresh. Custom. Donuts. Classic donuts with your choice of coatings, toppings, and drizzles, warm from being freshly made while you wait.  Don't go there for your Long Johns, eclairs, bear claws, and other \"fancy\" bakery items, because they don't have them.  But with fresh donuts, why would you want those things?"}
{"text":"After two years of living in Charlotte, I decided to see what the hype was about! I ventured here on a Sunday morning, and got about halfway there before I realized that the after church crowd had probably taken over just about everywhere that served food. I was pleasantly surprised to find ample parking and NO line (which was great for my anxiety as I had no idea how to order). Didn't know it was kind of \"build your own\" and of course I'm not exactly a donut connoisseur as far as flavors go, so that left me a little confused. All in all, tasty stuff. Didn't expect the cakey texture, but it worked!"}
{"text":"The location of this Duck Donuts is a little hidden and out of the way for me.  If you are in the South Village mall area, I'd recommend visiting.  I loved the warm vanilla donuts here!  We got the peanut butter paradise and bacon in the sun.  If you divide and conquer, you will get to try more flavors.  I loved the bacon donut, and was told they are the more popular options.  All toppings are done at the time of ordering, which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"I will never go to Krispy Creme ever again! One of the best doughnuts I've ever had. The doughnuts were fresh out of the fryer which was awesome! We got two of the Panther specials with vanilla frosting and black and blue sprinkles and we should have got A DOZEN!! I give it a 10!! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've had quite a few donuts in my time but I've never seen a donut shop that makes their donuts to order. My preference in donuts tends to lean towards light, fluffy, sugary, and glazed. (think Krispy Kreme original) Duck's donuts definitely vary from my go-to donut, which I actually find very appealing and unique. They're a lot heartier and breadier than your average by-the-dozen donut. They're sweet, but slightly less than what you're probably used to. (you're still gonna fall into a sugar coma an hour later if you eat more than one. don't be fooled) Their frosting/glazes have a subtle, \"we-made-this-in-the-store\" taste to them that I really love. Ex. Their strawberry frosting tastes like strawberries, not pink sugar. Their maple frosting is phenominal as well. Overall, quite a treat!"}
{"text":"These donuts are SOOO good!! I don't even like donuts that much, but I like these A LOT!!

I would suggest calling in your order or getting there really early (as in when they open) because they are very busy and you will have to wait. 

The wait is worth it though, so pick your battles!!"}
{"text":"Three words... Love. This. Place. I was so happy when I moved back to Charlotte from Virginia Beach to find out they were building a Duck Donuts here in the QC! I thought I would have leave this gem of a donut place behind in VA. GO HERE! You won't be disappointed. Get the maple bacon donut with the maple drizzle."}
{"text":"Though the donuts we had were indeed fresh, the powdered sugar got absorbed into the donut and wasn't great.  For the price (rather expensive), we didn't think Duck Donuts was a good value. The flavors of the donuts weren't anything spectacular either."}
{"text":"Big big let down! I've heard so much about this place that I managed to stop by their new location in Huntersville one early morning.  

It's obvious they're fairly new as they struggled to process my order and seemed a bit lost even with their own menu. The majority of the workers are young girls, so don't expect much in relation to customer service. The concept of watching them make fresh doughnuts is very cool, but I was not impressed with the taste. 

 It's not really a doughnut, more like a pound cake. They all taste the same even with all the toppings and coatings you can choose from. You won't find any glaze doughnuts here which was disappointing. The doughnut craze is huge in South Florida and North Carolina is way behind!"}
{"text":"Finally! On national donut day we made it to Duck Donuts! They are absolutely delicious! They melt in your mouth! They are also warm! The place is clean & they were so organized! They had the 3 free donut options (cinnamon sugar, bare, & powdered sugar) ready when customers arrived, which kept the line down tremendously! Good job Duck Donuts! We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly store! The donuts smell amazing! They are very fresh, just out of the oven warm. Never had a better donut anywhere! I hope they expand however. I believe the south hills has the only location!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of anticipation waiting for this place to open. Everyone loves a good gourmet donut and the Charlotte scene has been seriously lacking them. It is located in that little pocket of shops between Kenilworth and the East Blvd Harris Teeter (behind Menchies)
Duck Donuts is a little more simplistic than I was expecting.
You have one type of base donut.  
You then choose the type of icing you want. Off the top of my head, there were about 8-10 choices. I chose one with Orange icing and one with maple icing.  
Next you chose a topping to go on each donut. I think there were only five options here. I went with chocolate sprinkles on my orange iced donut and bacon on my maple iced donut. They also had coconut, peanuts and regular sprinkles.
There are about 40-50 different combinations you can make between icing and toppings. The ones I had were pretty delicious. They also came out fresh. My donuts were still hot when I got home with them five minutes later.
Ultimately I was not blown away to the point of now having to fight the urge to return, but they were very good and a great new place to grab breakfast. I'll be back for sure but think I can limit this to a once a month place instead of a once a week need."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD!!!
This is by far the absolute best donnut \"experience\" I've ever had.  Who cannot just absolutely love placing your order and the shear pleasure of watching (and smelling, BTW) your yummy donuts being made while you patiently wait?"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up!! Made to order donuts that you can watch bring fried. They are a cake-like consistency and super buttery tasting. Drooling yet? The specialty donut today was the key lime. My husband loved it. I made a maple glazed donut topped with crumbled bacon and coconut-also so good. We would recommend this place to anyone stopping by Charlotte."}
{"text":"$1.20 (including tax) for a made to order fresh hot moist donut with a choice of 10 icings and toppings? Yes please. The staff was incredibly friendly.  The doughnut (I went with maple drizzle and bacon pieces) was one of the best delights I've put in my mouth in a long time. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"Once you taste the donuts you'll understand the popularity of the place. This location is nestled ( truly nestled) in Dilworth neighborhood of Charlotte. The doughnuts are warm, soft and slightly 'cakey' ( it's not a word, but you get my meaning). THEN, there are several coatings and toppings you can choose . Yes, yes it's true, they do made to order donuts. So there is what makes them unique from other donut spots. They also have 12 suggested combinations they can make for you, but it's all made fresh , you can see them making them. This is definitely a must-visit place in Charlotte. They also have a location opening in Huntersville NC soon ( Spring 2017) and locations in other states. The coffee is also reasonably priced and delicious. Not a lot of seating , but still worth the visit."}
{"text":"My name is Terri and I am addicted to Duck Donuts. Fair warning that once you try Duck, you'll become addicted. Service is fast and friendly enough. They have great topping selections and if you're lucky enough to eat these fresh, you'll never go to dunkin donuts again! They are a must try!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.  This is a must stop for everyone (even if you HATE normal donuts).  The service is quick, the prices reasonable and the warm, delicious donuts are made to order! Can't beat this place.  Wish they had more locations.  Again, a must stop.  I recommend the \"Panthers\" special donut and anything with oreos or salted caramel.  You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've been to many of the Duck Donuts locations in North Carolina. I'm sold on their particular kind of cake doughnuts.. especially the maple bacon! So when I review the individual locations it usually just comes down to the service and atmosphere. I stopped at this location in Huntersville after meeting someone for lunch in northern Charlotte. As with their other locations, their doughnuts are made specifically to your order. I didn't have to wait long today, as it was mid-afternoon and they weren't busy. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes, which is almost unheard of in most of their locations. The staff there today was nice and efficient. The only small complaint I had today was that a couple of the doughnuts weren't cooked all the way through. Didn't matter- I scarfed several of them down right away! 

I will continue to seek out and visit their locations whenever I'm in an area that has them!"}
{"text":"I'm not big into donut shops but this has changed all that. Unique. Delicious. Melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"By far the best donut I have eaten, much less in Charlotte.
The donuts are fresh (you can watch them make it which is fun) and customized to order so you always get a warm and fresh donut.The Maple + Bacon + Salted Caramel is one of the favorites, and for a good reason. Especially warm, it is melt in your mouth worthy. However, I've had over types of donuts and I haven't had one that I haven't enjoyed.
There is a large variety of glazes, toppings, and drizzles to meet your needs, both for fruity, salty, and sweet. They also have a daily special (I've seen orange dreamsicle recently) as well as a glaze of the month so you can try something new.

There isn't a lot of seating (2 tables outside and a tabletop inside) so you may need to eat in your car or find another spot in the parking lot to sit. The wait, depending on the time of day, can be out the door, but typically later in the day is a little more reasonable.

You should definitely make Duck Donuts part of your weekend craze, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Still not sure if I like yeast or cake donuts better,  but ducks cake donuts sure are awesome.  the maple with or without bacon is probably my favorite.   try the cake donuts then immediately drive to Krispy Kreme for a yeast donut...its hard to decide!"}
{"text":"Good God these donuts were amazing & I just got some basic ones - cinnamon topped, chocolate glaze & a couple of sprinkled donuts for the kids. What amazed me was the quickness of the service, the creativity of the flavor combos (I'll be back to get more adventurous) and the softness of the doughnuts themselves. So fresh, almost melts in your mouth.  YUM."}
{"text":"I'm not a donut fan, but if I was... I'd probably go here every single day until the day I kicked the bucket. The donuts are fresh, made to order... some people don't like the fried-cake batter style, but a fresh batch with all the toppings you can imagine is hard to beat... no matter if you are a dunking donuts or a Krispy Kreme fan (y'all see what I did there?). These blow them out of the water, probably in taste and caloric content (don't quote me on that though). 

I've taken a few people here and every single one has said they will come back again after their next meal... it's that good."}
{"text":"We were told these are the best donuts ever, so I had to try them out. Wow! They're amazing! You watch them being made right there, and icing and toppings put on in front of you! You HAVE to eat at least one right away! Warm and soft, I've never had one like it! These are wow good! My favorite is peanut butter with chocolate drizzle! 
Also, the girl who took the order was very nice and patient! I look forward to going again"}
{"text":"I wish I could describe this place. But, it may take too many words. Or maybe, the word doesn't exist yet. Unique, delicious, indulgent, delightful, game-changing, fresh, swift, ambience. I could go on. And provide an endless list of run-on sentences lol. From 6-9:57am today, I've burned 1114 calories. This is how 5 out of 7 days, begin for me. So, I call it my \"burn it to earn it\" method. Burn a bunch of calories before noon. And reward myself with donuts that never make it out the parking lot(see attached photo)."}
{"text":"Man what a good donut!!  The perfect texture; not to light (like Krispy Kreme) and not too heavy (like a Cake donut).  It's just right.

You get to watch as they make the donuts fresh right before you order them.  Then each donut's toppings are added right in front of you, by hand. 

The donuts are so fresh.  They are warm and delicious and yummy.

It sounds gross, but try a Strawberry icing with Bacon crumbles.  Ree-donk-u-lous!"}
{"text":"Pretty food, but not so great to eat. First of all, I'm not a huge donut connoisseur. I admittedly don't know what makes the best dough, or too much behind the process, but I like my donuts to be lite, airy, and topped with fun. Duck Donuts delivers a product that is topped with all of the fun, but ALL on one, dense, yellow cake donut. Just a little to heavy for my personal preference.    They make Insta-worthy food, but personally I'd go for a more standardized chain donut before these."}
{"text":"If you're going to stuff your face with donuts, you might as well make every calorie worth it, right?  Duck Donuts definitely satisfied my craving, and I would rate the donuts at a solid \"good\".  Here's the scoop:

The Draw:  You walk in and you can literally see the donut machine making the donuts.  You can also fully customize your donuts.  You want Bacon with Chocolate frosting?  Done.  You want orange glaze with rainbow sprinkles?  Done.  Best part is that someone else gets to make the mess creating your donuts and you get to eat them.  Win...Win.

When to go:  The weekdays.  I stopped in here a little after lunchtime and there were only two people in line.  Based on what I read about the weekend lines, I think I'll avoid this place on a Sat/Sun.

What to order:  The Seasonal and Daily Donuts.  Yeah, ok they have sprinkles and bacon and all that fun stuff, but why not order what interesting creation they come up with!  I got the French Toast and Pumpkin Spice donuts.  Pumpkin was the winner.

Why I would go again:  For selfish reasons, I love that I can make whatever donut I want and get creative without actually doing the work.  This is also a great concept for anyone looking to create a personalized gift, thoughtful gift for someone with all of their favorite toppings...even if that someone is yourself!"}
{"text":"Theses donuts are perfect. Not too heavy or cake-y but definitely filling. Super fresh and fast! Must try the bacon topping!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not mind blowing donuts but good. The maple bacon was awesome though. Would I go again sure, would I make a special trip .....nah."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Love this place! Blueberry powdered sugar and Lemon with strawberry drizzle are the best!"}
{"text":"No complaints.  I wasn't sure where this Duck Donuts was located but it near JJ's Red Hots.  There was no wait at lunch time hours and my two donuts were quickly prepared.  Delicious and warm."}
{"text":"Oh my WORD. These beat out any donuts, anywhere, EVER. Seriously, so good. You just can't top that made to order goodness. So fresh, warm and delicious. We went today and there was a really good stream of people coming in and out. Despite being made to order, they're VERY quick, which we weren't anticipating. 

The only downfall of this particular location is how rude one of the workers (Chris) was. We got up to the counter with our order written on the order form and handed it to him. He started punching it into the register, then rolled his eyes and pointed to the form without saying anything. We explained that we wanted 2 donuts with maple icing and bacon. It was our first time ever at Duck Donuts and we mistakenly put a check mark under the \"Bacon\" column, rather than a \"2\". The way he handled it was just rude. The other person at the register, whose name was Hayden, I think, seemed much, much nicer. She was very chatty with everyone she was helping and just seemed genuinely kind.

Either way, we will be back. THIS is the place to go if you want delicious donuts."}
{"text":"I'll never buy DD or KK ever again & definitely never a store bought donut!!! This place is insanely good. I love fresh warm donuts. The price is amazing!!! First time I went I decided to buy for my coworkers so I got 2 dozen & they were gone in seconds... literally GONE lol"}
{"text":"I do not like donuts (call me a sinner), but these were just top notch!  They were more like a miniature cake in the shape of a donut.  They were a little more \"dense\" than a traditional donut, but I think that's what I liked most about it!  They have a maple bacon donut, which is unexpectedly tasty.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent! You choose everything and they couldn't be any more fresh!! Bacon and donuts, who is complaining?? I can't wait to go back or find an excuse to go back ;) I work in Dilworth and we often talk about the delicious\"ness\"! Thanks for coming to Charlotte!! There is going to be tons of returning customers!"}
{"text":"First experience at Duck Donuts for National Donut day... and oh BOY... my mind was blown! Yes BLOWN off the one donut I received for free. It was the powered donut, and I purchased some milk to go with mine. 

The donut was cooked to perfection and extremely fluffy. It seriously did not make it to my car as that was my intentions. 

Kuddos to the Duck Donuts team for being the real MVPs during National Donuts. They had prepped bags for customers that were only to receive their free donuts. So they were ready to handle anything we through there way."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fun to select your toppings and the donuts themselves are taste.  Chocolate sprinkles for me!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the donuts. They taste better while hot and fresh. The location was clean and I was in and out in a timely fashion. 

I was impressed with the cashiers knowledge on the product. I told her it was my first time and she act as if she could care less. I wasn't sure on what was good and had to probe her on the most popular flavors. 

Other than that I enjoyed my visit and donuts."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fresh and hot made to order doughnuts. You choose the glaze then the toppings then the drizzle. My best combo is maple glaze, bacon toppings with caramel drizzle. It tastes just like pancakes with bacon on top so good. The prices are great too. $1.30 each. I recommend this place for anyone who loves doughnuts."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome! It's the experience of watching your creation being prepared in front of you. You will not be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Very good donuts! I wasn't sure when we walked in for the first time but it was incredible. Been back several times and it is always a treat :)"}
{"text":"So I am a loyal Krispy Kreme fan but after hearing so many wonderful things about Duck's I've finally decided to try them out and I am a believer of the hype! 

Duck Doughnuts specializes in cake doughnuts which gives them a more denser doughnut, making them perfect for adding loads of toppings vs Krispy Kreme's melt in your mouth that are better(in my opinion )simply glazed. 

When I walked in I was greeted by the owner and staff and after explaining it was my first time, the owner who was working the register went over the doughnuts themselves as well as how to order. If you plan on ordering a really mixed assortment it's probably better (as well as more polite if it crowded) to grab a order sheet near the door and enter in the doughnuts that way to expedite the process. I ended up going with an assortment that included my bf's fav, the maple icing topped with bacon and my fav the lemon icing with coconut chips. 

When I arrived home I added some candles around them and presented my bf with Ducks doughnuts for his bday since neither of us really do cake! Perfect for any occasion and simply delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG - these donuts are sooooooooooooooooooooo good. Usually my brother-in-law brings them over to our house, I have only been to the actual store once, which was insanely overcrowded, but, the line did move quickly. Their donuts are amazing. Get the French Toast donut. They are thick and delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Duck Donuts, but had a family member bring a box over when they visited.  The donuts were so moist and delicious. There's a huge variety of flavors.  It was a cake donut but definitely better than Dunkin.  I will be going there myself - DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"If you want a heavenly donut then head to Duck Donuts. Stop what you are doing and go right now.  The Bacon Maple is like nothing you've ever tasted and needs to be experienced right now. The blueberry one under favorites is also too good to be true. If you want something simple stick the the cinnamon/sugar. Why are you still reading this??  GO, experience Duck Donuts, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 10 stars. DELISH. My husband and I happen to stumble upon this yummy donut shop as we're passing through Charlotte. FRESH DONUTS MADE TO ORDER. Why is this not a more popular idea?... I guess that would take away from the novelty of it.  Hands down. Best donut of my life. Melt. In. Your. Mouth. And I've had Gourdough's (in Austin). Which is now runner up. If you're passing through Charlotte. THIS IS A MUST."}
{"text":"I bought the maple bacon and salted caramel with nuts.....they were SO. DANG'ON. GOOD. I'm not a donut eater but this place could definitely get my repeat business!!! Trust.....you MUST try them!!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Duck Dounts out of the blue. You choose the glaze and toppings on your donuts. This was my first time at Duck Donuts and I was clueless to what I wanted to get. The young man behind the counter was very helpful. I ended up with lemon glaze with coconuts on top and cinnamon sugar with chocolate on top. I love the lemon glaze. Its donuts are not too heavy and not too sweet. They are fantastic donuts. I went on a Sat around 5:00 pm and I was first in line. Great customer services and great donuts."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with doughnuts.  For a while I thought Krispy Kreme was the best doughnut in the whole wide world! I was so wrong, and so naive.  I have come into the light, and duck donuts reigns supreme in my delectable desserts category!  I love the lemon icing and the maple icing.  The doughnuts are so soft and airy, it is like nothing I ever tasted.  They make the doughnuts to order so you aren't picking from a display case. They fry and dip/ice/glaze the doughnuts right there.  They are so tasty the next day, and a few days beyond, but do yourself a favor and eat a fresh one... oh emm gee, it's like heaven."}
{"text":"OMG! SPECTACULAR! Duck donuts is hands down the  best donut in Charlotte. This place is packed out with Duck Donut fans and now I know why :) The customer service was very friendly. The made to order donuts are fast. 
I would definitely recommend Duck Donuts."}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, GIMME SOME.  I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for awhile.  Usually when that happens, my expectations are so high that I end up disappointed.  Not this time!

I met a friend for dinner and we stopped by Duck Donuts on the way to our painting class.  I may have been so excited I started jumping up & down.  

We were in a hurry, there was no line luckily at 6pm on a Friday.  The donuts were made fresh and quickly! 

I like my donuts simple, so I ordered Cinnamon Sugar and Glazed.  Both were perfection!!!!!!  And I mean I'll be dreaming about them until I am able to go back.  Warm, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. 

The service at the shop was prompt & friendly. 

You will not be disappointed with these yummy donuts!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I visited on their grand opening day and it was a really cute and festive time.  The owner had it well staffed and even though there was a line out the door, considering that the donuts are made to order, the line moved along at a good pace.  Not much room for seating, but they would have been too hot for me to eat right away anyway.   Loved the pick your own topping.  I would have liked to see them be a little more generous with the drizzle, though.  Other from that, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Walked over from CMC hospital- terribly disappointing - donut was greasy and bacon (maple bacon) was soggy- have had better donuts from nearly every other donut shop I have visited."}
{"text":"cakey donuts are in and the best of them all is lemon glaze with blackberry drizzle. trust me on this one, y'all."}
{"text":"I stopped in while traveling on trip. It was fun and delicious. I brought donuts to office and we loved them"}
{"text":"One, the smell of fresh donuts is EVERYTHING. Seeing what you're about to eat/inhale is the absolute best. The line always moves rather quickly and my order is always 100% right. 

Actually... writing this has made me realize I need to go back this Sunday!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with made-to-order cake donuts and freshly brewed coffee. I got the Cinnamon Sugar with Vanilla Drizzle (holiday spirit donut, anyone?!) and Peanut Butter and Chocolate Drizzles, freaking delicious.

How it works:
- Choose your coating: glazed, powdered sugar, or icing.
- Choose your topping: sprinkles, chocolate, graham Cracker, chopped peanuts, bacon Pieces, shredded coconut, or oreos.
- Choose your drizzle: hot fudge, marshmallow, salted caramel, raspberry, or blackberry.

Donuts were fresh and small.
Coffee was good.
Staff were helpful and friendly. 

Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"The best donuts/dessert around!! We have gone back since our first visit and now we crave these donuts all the time! Check them out!"}
{"text":"The donuts were very good.
The selection was amazingly good.
The store was clean.
The employees were very nice and helpful.
The prices were great.
The store location was convenient.
I can't think of a single bad thing to say.
I love this place."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THESE. DONUTS.
We had our lives changed by Duck Donuts Saturday morning, where we got our first half dozen. We were back Sunday to get a full dozen because they were so good. My boyfriend and I enjoyed these so much. He shed a single tear after his first bite, i wish i had filmed it. These are worth the trip, and worth the experience. The customers are soooo friendly. The cashiers have been not so friendly on both trips. Which really left a bad taste in our mouth. But the staff handing out our freshly boxed donuts were always very kind and upbeat! Bottom line, we will be here regularly. But i hope we run into more polite cashiers since thats our first point of contact when we visit."}
{"text":"There is nothing like getting a fresh hot doughnut other getting one that is custom made to order.  My favorite is the maple bacon and I feel like theirs is one of the best. They use bacon crumbles which makes the bacon ratio more even for each bite compared to a place that shall remain nameless that uses full strips of bacon and serves their donuts in a pink box. They may have created it but Duck donuts perfected it. 

I also like that they offer seasonal options like the current mint frost or drizzle. Parking can be difficult if you come during peak dining times as the share a parking lot with two great restaurants and a froyo place. You may have to park in the teeter parking lot but the walk is worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Duck Donuts since my boyfriend made it very clear that we needed to go! A lot of people compare Peace, Love, and Little Donuts to Duck Donuts and I cannot agree with that. Duck Donuts' donuts are full size cake donuts for half the price of PL&LD! I believe a dozen costs around $13, but you're getting super fresh, STILL HOT, donuts, with any glaze, topping, and/or drizzle you choose at no extra cost! It has never been a long wait, considering they do make all the donuts MTO so expect to wait at least 5 minutes or so. They have water and usually samples of donuts while you wait, so there's nothing to really complain about! Warning-they can be pretty messy, but that's all the fun! Super family friendly and for a great price!

The only problems I had with this location is that it is very small and when you walk through the doors, you walk right into the people that are waiting for their donuts along with anyone in line to order. It can get very cramped. Also, they have little notepads where you can write down your order ahead of time, but people just take the entire notepad to use, so just keep an eye out for that. Lastly, their hours on Sundays are rough, being that they're only open until 2pm! So get out of bed and make sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"1st time coming here after hearing amazing things about this donut shop. People have just been raving about this place for months, so I had to try it while I was near by. So the shop is nice, efficient, and friendly. The menu is promising, with lots of option for any tastebuds. I got the maple bacon, which is a shop fav and a few other classic flavors like glazed and cinnamon sugar. My consensus is they are good not great by any stretch. To put it simply, they are overrated. That's just my opinion, if someone brought me one I'd eat it, but I would not go out of my way to purchase any. I guess with all the rave, it's just a matter of preference."}
{"text":"YUM!! I went here on a Tuesday, mid-morning, so no line. I typically appreciate outside the box flavors in a donut experience, but this place is doing simple right. 

They allow you to make your own donut by picking a glaze and toppings. Then the donut is made to order, hot and delicious! 

I ordered lemon with chocolate drizzle, cinnamon sugar, and chocolate with peanuts. My friend raved about maple with bacon. All that to say, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of donuts but these donuts are ....sinful. Addictive too.
The only issue I had is with the donuts being handed to you in a not-so-tidy manner.
Icing dripping down the side of the boxes is not good. The staff should take a little time and wipe off the boxes BEFORE handing them over to customers."}
{"text":"I was very exciting to go here for the first time last week! There was a long line but it moved quickly. The donuts were absolutely delicious  My favorite was chocolate icing with BACON! I thought the prices were very reasonable, especially when you think of other treats like cupcakes which can cost $3-$5/cupcake. My only complaint was that there were not w lot of sprinkles on my batch of donuts. I even saw a sign behind the counter with pictures of appropriate amounts of toppings and my half dozen did not look like the example. Besides that, I plan on going back!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is AMAZING! If you can eat them fresh right when they had it made, I can literally say 'oh-my-gosh! this is GOOD stuffs!'.  Funny thing is, I normally don't like donuts nor sweets at all & for me to rave about this place is saying a lot.  (I'm sitting here kind of knockin' myself for being so crazy over them but yeah, I am a fan!) 

I got to try them for the first time a couple months ago and luckily, I went on a Sunday afternoon around 1-2pm so they weren't super busy. I was a little lost and confused when I got there but the African American lady cashier there was SO NICE and SO SO FRIENDLY.  She helped me choose and picked all different & random combination to create these goodies! Even I was a little afraid of taking up too much time in line deciding whats not but she did not care at all nor seems annoyed.  In fact, she won't even let me apologized about it! That's what you called stellar customer service! I love that you get to choose whatever you want and they're not even that expensive!  I also liked that I can watch them put the donuts together! Kinda cool of an assembly.

However, my first bite of their popular Bacon topped with Maple glaze was truly truly amazinnnngggg.  It was warm, soft, a little crispy with a slight salty and sweet combo together, oh my gosh, soo soooo good. It felt like heaven biting into it! If you waited and eat it later and re-heated it up in the microwave, it's not the same. Definitely better if you could just eat it right there at the store when you first brought it. I loved it so much my first time, I kept thinking about it. I even came back for seconds a few weeks later but was a little disappointed the cashier lady that I liked wasn't working.  The guy who took my order was just basic, simple.  Didn't really offer much help or cared, just doing his job and getting my order done. Was a little bummed but still, the donuts were bomb-diggity! Literally, made me happy again after biting into it. 

Don't go first thing in the morning, I heard there's a long line out the door! There really isn't much seating inside either so it's really a drop in and out the door kind of place but service was quick unless it's during busy hours."}
{"text":"Duh- make your own delicious doughnut need we say more?!  Original one in Duck is best, but I'm all about making my own nut! Lol"}
{"text":"These donuts were by far the best I have ever tasted. They have ruined all other donuts for me! You customize your donut, and they have various options for toppings. The service was really fast and friendly. Their iced coffee was also delicious."}
{"text":"Great place with great donuts. The donuts are made after you order and always warm! Kinda crowded during peak times tho. So may be good to go after morning rush and during week. But i will say that they get you in and out pretty quickly. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Obviously there's nothing better than warm, customized donuts. Duck Donuts is great. It's a great, affordable place to go in and get your customized donuts. The bacon is probably the best on any donut in town. The cinnamon sugar donut is amazing. I'm only giving it a 4 because they've got a competitor down the road that is through the roof. However, this is in a great location, family friendly, and they provide quick service. I get overwhelmed standing in line trying to figure out what we will do"}
{"text":"For the 8/21/2017 eclipse, my building bought some of the special eclipse donuts. I was excited to try them after hearing about them several times the previous week. Alas, they didn't send me to the moon. 

They were nice and I was glad they weren't too sweet, but the dough texture was much less fluffy than I like; the donut actually felt a little lumpy. Also the frosting didn't taste like the chocolate or cream it appeared to emulate--it was bland. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a free donut any day. But I wasn't enticed to go back for a second. 

Gotta say, though, I did love the theme and am always stoked when a retailer supports science, regardless of whether or not there are commercial underlying motivations."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and oh my goodness it was ahhhhhmazing. We got a dozen donuts, mixed glazes and toppings and each one we tried was perfection. We will definitely be coming back for more! It's a bit of a drive for us but beyond worth it."}
{"text":"Cute place! Donuts are delicious and 100% customizable! I had the smores donuts and gained about 5lbs in 5 minutes :)"}
{"text":"The best donuts !! You create your own donut flavors which is prefect. You watch them mach your prefect !! Love it!!"}
{"text":"The donuts are great, I haven't had one yet that I didn't like.  Maple Bacon is my favorite.  The 5 star rating for me is their customer service.  I didn't realize they closed at 3:00 pm on certain days of the week.  When I walked up to the store at 3:15 or so, the employees were inside and asked what my order would be and luckily they had donuts on hand to complete my order as well as 3-4 other people that walked up after me."}
{"text":"Quick service. You can mix/match any flavors. I love these donuts!! Maple with bacon is my go to. Delicious when warm, also good to microwave later."}
{"text":"Great cake donuts with interesting combinations of coatings and toppings.  They pretty much make it anyway you want it.  Personally, i love the cinnamon sugar with vanilla drizzle!  The regular strawberry coating is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?! If donuts weren't full of sugar and fat, I'd have these every single day! 

The set up of duck donuts was awesome. It was similar to an assembly line how they prepped them for you. They were made fresh to order and you could watch the employees making them which I thought was pretty cool. And for how many people were there, it was packed, they were going to the line pretty quick! The one thing that did catch my eye in a negative way was that the girl who took my order at the cash register was texting in between customers which was holding up the line longer than it needed to be. Other than that, all the employees were super nice and attentive.

Now to the good part! The donuts were delicious, they literally just melted in your mouth. I don't think I've ever had a cake a donut before but it's now my favorite go to treat! We got the maple glaze with bacon, the cinnamon bun (the daily special), and a glazed with rainbow sprinkles. We could not get these donuts down fast enough!! They had sooo many different toppings and glazes, I didn't know what to do! The ones we had were awesome though. I can't wait to go back and try some different mixes!"}
{"text":"Just glorified Krispy Creme donuts in my opinion. But not a bad option for decent donut if you're hankering for a one. 

The store was a pretty dirty. Especially the counters, which meant my donut boxes had random icing and topping stuck to the bottom, making putting them in my car a real delight."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I get a little overwhelmed trying to order. There's so many toppings and glazes that trying to be creative yet figure out what will go well together is a little stressful. They do have a list of suggested combinations which helps a lot. Also, the cashier will give their opinions on what will go well with what you want. These donuts are a bit heavier than donuts that I am used to but overall good. I think it's a cake battered donut that's deep fried. The box usually has oil stains which makes me feel like I need to go eat a salad. If you've ever played Cooking Fever, this is the Donut Shop in the game."}
{"text":"Great donuts and an owner who cares about his business and his product!  Great prices and fabulous donuts.  Workers can be a little preoccupied with personal chitchat and are slow at finishing donuts at times since owner is typically taking orders.  Be prepared for a wait at peak times.  I typically get up early if I am feeling a craving since I hate to wait."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  The donuts are great.  My favorite is the The Maple +  Bacon + Salted Caramel  one. Umm umm good!!  Parking can be a challenge but other than that the donuts and service has been good."}
{"text":"For all the running I do, I usually find ways to \"treat myself\".... after all, this kid has got to eat sometime...  Donuts are probably up there as far as my running rewards.  My run group even had a Thursday morning run in which we decided to run from the running store, through Dilworth, and finish at Duck Donuts (to \"check it out\").

Granted, we came right when they opened at 6am (our runs start at 5:30am)... so I think the staff was expecting a 'normal' morning and ended up being a bit \"deer-in-headlights\" that morning.  All in good fun.  They took us in stride (there were about 20-25 of us so it took a while (especially since they make the donuts to order for you).

I tried the maple glaze with bacon topping and it was amazing.  We also just finished doing like 3 miles so it probably put me over my daily calories, but it was darn worth it.  All the different glazes and toppings, there is a donut for everyone here.  I've even started seeing some cyclists ride up East Blvd, with a Duck Donuts box tucked into their cycling jerseys in the back.

This location has a small parking lot and shares it with the other businesses.  The important thing to note is that its not in the \"main\" lot where the Harris Teeter is... it is one away... closer to Kenilworth and next to the Bag Lady.

I know Charlotte/North Carolina is \"KK\" territory, but I'm glad to see these guys in the Queen City.  I'm all about competition to make each other better."}
{"text":"Came up to Huntersville to cheer some folks on in the Huntersville Half Marathon this past weekend.  We met up with friends here at Duck Donuts to get some fuel and also to buy a dozen (holiday assortment) for our friends running the race.

It was super early in the morning, but we all decided to try their breakfast sandwiches, that I did not know about.  Basically a bacon/sausage/egg and cheese sandwich... but you can use donuts as the bread.  #mindblown.

The staff here was super friendly (even though we were there super early).  They open at 6am, but we were the only ones there at 7, with a steady trickle of folks picking up for their Saturday functions.

Same freshly made donuts and toppings here.  SO GOOD!  I think they are constantly thinking of new flavor combinations for those that can't make up their mind... or for those that KNOW what they want, you can customize your donuts as needed.  Self serve coffee here and a small fridge of milk and other essentials while eating donuts.

This location is at the end of the shopping center (corner) so it is roomier than the East Blvd (Charlotte location)... there are more tables and chairs here too.  The place seems more spacious.  With the Harris Teeter next door, there are plenty of parking spots.  I'm sure during the day, the lot will fill up with the other businesses in this center, but the parallel spots (to the sidewalk) are perfect around this location."}
{"text":"I've had better . They were good, but not great . I feel this place is overrated . Krispy Kreme is better in my opinion !"}
{"text":"This place was really good. I was here on vacation in OBX and passed by. We got a whole box of donuts that were all very, very good. I had a chocolate covered donut that was hot and melted in my mouth. The donuts are made throughout the store it goes all around and comes out hot and fresh! I definitely suggest this place for anyone passing through OBX."}
{"text":"First time was on Memorial Day, thankfully we beat the crowd. The thing that took the longest was deciding what we wanted to order. Within minutes, these warm pillow soft donuts were at our table and we were instantly ruined for other donut shops. The best donuts I've ever eaten, no question. We had the cinnamon sugar, maple with nuts, peanut butter with salted caramel, s'mores, strawberry/raspberry and lemon with rainbow sprinkles. Close enough to home for once in a while visits, but far enough that I won't need a wheelbarrow to get myself around."}
{"text":"Yesssss!!! These donuts are sooo good! My favorite has to be the maple glaze with real bacon. Each donut had a crunch to it and inside is soft and moist..amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything i wanted and more. Warm and fresh . The cinnamon sugar was simply delightful. I got the two donut combo with coffee. I also tried the Oreo doughnut. I really wanted to go back and get a 6pack for myself!

The were extremely quick and patient while i decided my flavors of doughnuts"}
{"text":"Three words: Maple. Bacon. Donut. Life-changing. Can't say enough good things about this place. Get there early (pre 9am) on a weekend to avoid a long line. Make sure you know what you're want before you get to the register so as not to annoy the long line of people behind you ..."}
{"text":"Great new place in Huntersville. Donuts are fresh and service is great. Fun place to go."}
{"text":"First time going to Duck Donuts, the donuts are pretty good and the customer service is excellent but being that I've never been to one of these stores before ordering can be a bit overwhelming if you have no idea what you want. I didn't know where to start so I ended up getting a blueberry muffin and a regular glazed donut."}
{"text":"I've been in Duck, NC before and I've never had the opportunity to try the donuts. I was beyond excited when I heard there was a location now right outside of Pittsburgh! 

The donuts are made fresh right in front for you. This is such a great place to take kids to let them make their own creations. This is also a cute date idea for dessert. You could make each other's donuts  . 

I got a maple bacon donut and my girlfriend the coconut island bliss (coconut, chocolate, peanuts.) Both were delicious and I was sad we only got one each. The toppings on both were falling off because there was so much. 

There is nothing better than fresh hot donuts that are affordable. I cant wait to go back again! If you haven't visited the place you're truly missing out."}
{"text":"Was so excited when this got to Charlotte! Tried the one in outer banks and this new location does not disappoint. Nothing beats made to order donuts"}
{"text":"I don't really know where to begin. We'd been looking for genuinely good cake donuts in Charlotte and had lost hope, since the city is enamored with yeast donuts (thanks, Krispy Kreme). On a whim, while our power was out, we went to Duck Donuts and...

Well, golly.

1. They're crazy reasonably priced.
2. They're crazy varied in their toppings.
3. THEY'RE CRAZY FREAKING GOOD.

Best in Charlotte, hands down. Warm with chocolate frosting for me, and maple with bacon for the husband. We both also really enjoyed the cinnamon sugar ones, though they could do with a little less sugar and a little more cinnamon.

Bravo, Duck Donuts. You guys are deeeeeelish."}
{"text":"Legit, tasty, damn good donut.  This isn't a krispy kreme or dunkin donuts.  This is different, freshly made, warm and made to order when you bite into them.

We've been twice and had the maple bacon, peanut butter w/chocolate, coconut, etc.

Coffee is actually pretty good and i'm a large critic of water downed dishwater at most places.

All delicious, definitely a must go to, we go each time we are in town."}
{"text":"These donuts are awesome. Before discovering this hidden gem I had no clue what happiness was. The donuts are hot, fresh and made to order. The staff was very helpful in helping my decide how to customize my donuts with. I have returned several times and have  enjoined every combination I've tried thus far."}
{"text":"I tried Duck Donuts for the first time after readying such great reviews. Let me say, for someone that is a big fan of cake donuts...this is your place!  For me, a newly discovered yeast donut fan...they were a tad heavy and sweet for my taste. I am still giving them 4 stars because I really think that this was more of my own personal preference as opposed. The service was friendly, the store was super clean, and this is a great treat place for someone looking for a hearty cake donut."}
{"text":"Luckily the coffee is not good, because I would be 20 pounds heavier if it was. The donuts are delicious and addictive. I would want to come here every day, if they had good coffee."}
{"text":"This place is worth the 25 minute out of the way drive! The staff is friendly and the donuts never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I drove out here on my day off based on the good reviews; figured I'd stop here then up the Trader Joe's at Metropolitan. As usual, in Charlotte, there is construction and lane closures on the street leading up to the shopping center. It took a good 15 minutes to go about 1 mile to get to the parking lot. Like Jimmy D., I am definitely a yeast donut girl not a cake donut girl. Like everyone says, they are hot and glazed to order. They were very sweet and very sticky so no scrimping on the glaze here. I tried a plain glazed and a chocolate glazed - under $3. Inexpensive and nothing to complain about just not my scene. I wouldn't make a trip here just for donuts but I wouldn't say no to one if someone brought them into work."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot, custom donuts - pick your toppings and wait for your number.  Delicious!   I chose blueberry glaze and lemon drizzle."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating.  Great donuts.  Been to the one on the outer banks in Duck and had to share this with my team.  They loved them.  Cool  location with nice staff and a great product!  Kind of a can't lose."}
{"text":"These donuts better be good because the customer service is horrible! I'll change my rating after I eat it, if it needs it
******
Ok yea, despite my experience with the customer service these donuts are banging!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't met someone who doesn't like Duck Donuts! Hands down, the best donuts in the QC! Do yourself a favor and get a donut with maple glaze & bacon pieces.... so amazing!!"}
{"text":"The busy store shows the popularity of the place. It's a very cool concept - made to order donuts. All donuts are made using cake donuts and then you can choose your icing and topping. There are a few specials to choose from as well.  

I thought the donuts were good but a little greasy. I ordered two and couldn't eat more due to the richness and grease content of them. All in all, it was a good place."}
{"text":"To start with, the store is pretty small with only a few tables. You can customize your donut with different glazes and toppings, and they also have different drinks and coffee with quite a few Torani syrups. The ordering process was simple and quick, and my donut came out very quickly. The donut was also HOT, definitely not day old or even hour-old donuts here. 
I chose the French toast daily special with maple icing, cinnamon sugar, and powdered sugar. The maple icing was good but mostly just sweet and not a ton of maple flavor. The donut itself wasn't a super dense cake donut (which I really love) but also wasn't a super airy Krispy Kreme style, so a good balance that most people would enjoy. Overall the donut was tasty but pretty small. For the quickness with specialized options and not too steep of a price, it wasn't bad though!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Duck Donuts by a friend who lives in Raleigh. Hands down best donuts I've ever had. I'm from TN so I'm not able to have them often. On a whim, I decided to look up donut shops in Charlotte for our upcoming visit and there is one here!!  Just as delicious and fresh as I remember. The texture of the donut is like children's laughter....you can never get enough. Friendly, patient staff."}
{"text":"They're good donuts, I like the options to build, I like the preset options to order. Reason for 4 stars is because of the staff like  would it break your face to smile? Or just have a more upbeat persona. If it was one person I could've assumed they were just having a bad day (which still leave your  in the can when you walk in) but it seemed to be the general attitude amongst the workers. Come on you work with sugar and donuts!! It's been over a month since we went in (and it was our first) and that my lasting impression was the ambience and staff was just unpleasant."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Charlotte!!  The concept of being able to order what icing and toppings you want is genius.  They make it right then and there for you so they are warm and fresh!  Peanut butter icing with chocolate sprinkles is delicious, but just the plain glaze donut melts in your mouth. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I am from Florida, so Krispy Kreme doughnuts are my measuring stick for donuts. Our friends can over last weekend and came with fresh Starbucks coffee and a box of hot Duck Donuts! The Mint Icing with Oreo Crumbles and Hot fudge was amazing. The Cinnamon Sugar with Caramel Drizzle was my wife's favorite. I am a new fan of the Duck;)"}
{"text":"Duck donuts is the new hot spot for donuts!!! It has just been open a couple days and I've been twice already! My favorite combination is maple icing and bacon. The lemon icing is also very tasty. They have several other flavors that I need to try like zebra and Reese's. The donuts are a cake donut and they are made fresh  to order. Duck donuts also offers some breakfast sandwich options and other treats like muffins and yogurt but I think they have me with the donuts!!! 
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is a good spot but kinda hidden in the Kenliworth Commons shopping mall.  Inside the shop there is lots of standing room and space to view the donuts being freshly made and topped with all the delicious toppings! They also have some seating and tables available. I can't wait to bring others and let them try these delicious donuts!!!"}
{"text":"After all the hype, I was disappointed by the donuts. They are very cake-like and not gooey at all. I do like the flavor options, but I'd rather eat an original glazed from Krispy Kreme"}
{"text":"Not impressed with Duck Donuts, I've heard good things about it, but my experience was underwhelming.

They don't have any donuts with filling inside, they just sprinkle things on top, which for me is a minus. Their cinnamon donuts were nothing to write home about. Pretty common taste wise. Customer service wasn't particularly good, the clerk we got wasn't very pleasant, the girls that were preparing our order were talking to each other the whole time. The parking lot was pretty crowded. But what it matters to me most is the taste, the flavor of the donuts which were pretty generic and not distinctive."}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day to see what all the hype is about. On pulling into the shopping center it's very dead and this not much of a sign showing it's here. The parking lot was pretty empty being it was around 1230 1pm. On entering the store it was empty and sadly I was not greeted by the girl working. Being my first time here I was not to sure what to do but I found the paper and pencil to check off what you want. I walked up to the counter and handed it to the girl. It was surprisingly cheap running about $1.50 for a donut with toppings. The drinks where all around $2 to $4 bucks. I decided just to have some water but they give you very tiny cups. They did offer some shirts and other promotional stuff. I decided to get the chocolate, peanuts and salted caramel donuts. I don't think it was a good choice being I only ate half of it. The chocolate was just a bit to much and the donut had to much of a cake like taste. I had half and tossed it being to sweet for me. My experience did not stand up to the hype and sadly overall I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The donuts were hot and delicious. Great variety to choose from and loved the customizable option!"}
{"text":"Duck Donuts will always be delicious! However, the staff could be more friendly and helpful instead of making it clear they want the rush out of the door."}
{"text":"This is a nice doughnut shop. The staff is friendly enough and the doughnuts are really good."}
{"text":"It's dangerous this place is walking distance from Carolinas Medical Center, where I've been visiting my mom. The donuts are fresh and customized to order so be prepared to wait a bit, not only in line to order but also while they make it. The wait is worth it though. The donut is warm, chewy, and cakey, but also airy so it's not dense. The base is the same; it's the coating, toppings, and drizzle that make the donut pop. My brother had his go-to maple bacon donut. The bacon is real and generously sprinkled on top of a maple iced donut. I tried the chocolate icing with chocolate sprinkles and the salted caramel drizzle - it was very good! The combinations are endless and I can't wait to try another one soon."}
{"text":"As someone who has only known Peace, Love, and Little Donuts I had high expectations, but they were met if not exceeded. While PL&LD's have smaller, denser cake donuts, Duck Donuts are larger and somehow lighter. They come out warm--as you stand in line you can watch them on the conveyer belt as they are fried and decorated. They also give a lot of freedom in your ability to customize toppings and frostings with their whiteboard style menu. 10/10 worth the drive out of the city to get them."}
{"text":"Have heard tons about this place from friends and donut lovers, but had yet to visit. Last weekend when I was home my boyfriend and I met my family for a quick breakfast at Duck Donuts.

We walked over in Dilworth and were met with delicious aromas and friendly cashiers to help us through the decadent process.

Donuts are homemade (you can watch) and there are many batter flavors as well as icing swirls dunks toppings etc. There are even seasonal options. Our donuts were warm and fresh. The thing I was most surprised about was the price. I expected it to be overpriced and a treat, but it was reasonable. Two donuts and two coffees for about $7 bucks. 

I would definitely recommend if you like rich and sweet breakfast! :)"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!!!! AWESOME!!!. these donuts are really.. really good! My favorite is the maple bacon donuts. I can eat a whole box all by myself!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it very good and friendly service the donuts were delicious much better than dunkin I'll try something different next time I'm in"}
{"text":"Yummy place to get some homemade donuts, they practically melt in your mouth.  Very yum yum."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  When you come here you actually get to design your own donuts! You get to pick from a large amount of frostings from blueberry to maple, they have a ton of selection!  They also have a drizzle option with a bunch of different flavors as well like peanut butter!  They even have a TON of toppings to choose from to complete your donut.  They also have pictures of some of their signature donuts if you're not feeling creative.  My absolute favorite donuts were the chocolate Oreo dirt one that comes with gummy worms and also the blueberry pancake one.  The best part though is that they serve it to you hot and fresh.  The staff was really great and patient which is great for indecisive people like me and before you take your box of donuts they show you them to make sure they're perfect.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I only used to like the donuts from Krispy Kream, but this place is a must. They make the donuts right in front of you, fresh...yummy goodness. Well, but that is not all! You can choose your topping and the toppings are from your plain vanilla to salted caramel and bacon maple. 

This place is always packed on the weekend, but I never have to wait too long. The prices are extremely decent and inviting. Get a coffee with your donuts and all is good. The seating area is small and seating is sparse, but that also does not matter, because most people do not come here to sit down. They rather grab their donut and devour it at home. Since this is in my neighborhood I come here often. I support local business and quality!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Duck Donuts on a trip to the Outer Banks last year. When I heard Charlotte was getting one, I nearly fell out of my chair in excitement.

The key to a good donut is freshness, and it doesn't get any fresher than made-to-order. The maple bacon is my favorite, but all of the toppings are fantastic.

I went on a late Sunday morning, which I assumed was a huge mistake on my part, but got in and out surprisingly quickly. Coffee was pretty good, too.

If you don't love Duck Donuts, you're wrong."}
{"text":"When so many donut places are giving us stale donuts, Duck Donuts reinvents the process and takes it back old school.  They actually make them to order.  So many choices make for an almost unlimited combinations so everyone is happy.  Don't pass up the opportunity to stop by and get your favorite if you are in the area."}
{"text":"These donuts are soooo yummy. I love that the donuts are fresh and warm. I truly enjoyed the strawberry glazed donuts. This will always be my choice for fresh, hot donuts."}
{"text":"I would always hear that Duck Donuts are better than Krispy Kreme. Growing up on KK donuts, I found this hard to believe. Until I tried one of my own!! They're AMAZING!! I love the maple bacon but now that I no longer eat pork, the mint glaze with cookie crumbles, strawberry lemonade, and strawberry shortcake flavors are delicious!! Don't be afraid to try new flavors, you can't go wrong with Duck Donuts! Everything is yummy!"}
{"text":"Duck Donuts is pretty delicious. There's usually a long line I would suggest calling in the order in advance. We picked up 6 dozen for a wedding and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I was the first customer on opening day :). Delicious made-to-order doughnuts.  You cannot go wrong at this place!"}
{"text":"Duck Donuts is simplicity to the fullest. Only serving a cake dough with very limited toppings . I feel what makes these donuts attractive is they are pretty much hot each time you order so no waiting for that \"hot now sign\" . I'm not a huge fan of the instantly fried cake donut, it wasn't bad, just a little crunchy on the outside. The icing and toppings are coated on by hand after they are dropped off the belt for each order which was cool, I just wish there was an assortment of dough and toppings. 

My reason for giving duck donuts three stars is because there aren't many options, but like I said earlier it is a good spot if you love vanilla cake donuts .

So , if I have someone ask where can I get a yummy cake donut ... Exit stage right to duck donuts , that's all folks ."}
{"text":"Very cool that you can get a warm donut made to order just how you want it. Mine was delicious and the coffee was good too! Will be back for sure when I'm in Charlotte. It may not be the healthiest, but I justify my coffee and dunuts by having them as my pre-workout meal! Now I feel great and I'm ready to train. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Today my wife and I got up around 2:30pm and made it just in time. from fort mill SC.and it was so good cant wait to go back.  THANK YOU DUCK DONUTS."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love hot, fresh doughnuts?  We've been to their flagship  location in Duck, and we're thrilled that Duck Donuts decided to expand to the CLT region.

The process is simple - you order and pay at the counter, and then pick up your freshly dipped doughnuts at the end of the line.  The process is faster and easier than you would think, and their prices are very reasonable, too.

My only complaint?  Their early closing hours.  Why aren't they open later on weekends to accommodate those who'd love a doughnut for dessert after dinner?  Since they close so early at 7pm on Saturdays, that makes it quite difficult.  I'd visit more, if they would extend their hours!"}
{"text":"Prior to my recent visit I'd only ever been to the original Duck Donuts in Duck, NC. Nothing can really top a warm donut from the original location, but the franchised versions are trying their best to replicate.

If you love donuts it's worth the visit. 

I had the maple-glazed bacon donut."}
{"text":"The donuts are good, but they are very $$$. Paid $29 for 24 donuts. I brought them for my office and everyone did really enjoy the different and non conventional types."}
{"text":"It may take you a minute to understand your options,but once you do....Aww man it's like a kid in a candy store. The maple frosting on any doughnut is to die for."}
{"text":"The donuts are out of this world!!!! They melt in your mouth and they are served fresh and warm. You can create your own donut and the people are nice and helpful. I love the service. I would definitely come back in a heartbeat. If you are feeling sad, this is the place to go!!!! And the prices are good"}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Denise and I love donuts. If you know me, you know that I will almost never turn down a donut. 

I'm a fan of donuts that are light, soft and flaky (like the original glazed from KK). These are not like that, yet they still impressed me. I loved that these donuts were warm, fresh and MTO. They start with a vanilla cake base and you are able to add icing (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, lemon, maple etc.) and other toppings like bacon bits, sprinkles, coconut flakes and more. They also have special donuts like orange creamsicle and pumpkin! 

My donut came out to be about $1.29~ a piece. It's well worth it. See you at Duck Donuts!"}
{"text":"Great selection. You pick your flavor of icing and toppings. And they are all fresh to order. Maple bacon and strawberry coconut was our hot mix ups. For the price can't go wrong. But you really need to eat them warm"}
{"text":"So happy they have opened in Pittsburgh!  Love these donuts!!!  They are warm and fresh and surprisingly light.  Try the sand dollar - tastes like funnel cake!"}
{"text":"Truly the most amazing donut you will ever have!!  All custom to order and there are flavors for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Donuts were great. I like the fact that you can create your own donut. Bit of advice, eat it ASAP, the sooner you eat it the better it taste."}
{"text":"OMG. That's all I really have to say. Best donuts I have tasted! Good prices and friendly service! I love this place so much. Every donut is great but I favor the maple bacon, because who wouldn't?!! Love!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We drove 35 minutes from our home to try these donuts and I must say I was impressed!!! Good assortment of flavors, toppings, and glazes but I was a little disappointed by there being no filled donuts or apple fritters etc.. we ordered a dozen $15 and they where made to order by hand which the kids thought was cool. My fav was the maple bacon but I've had my eye on this donut for awhile!! Also had French toast, vanilla w/ Oreo crumbles, chocolate with salted Carmel, strawberry with powdered sugar.. all of them were great and we will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Best place for donuts, ever. Fast, fresh and made to order on top of friendly service. Much better than Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"Airport anxiety is soothed with a made to order donut. And awesome of awesomes? it's not really far off the path home. Treat? Donut mind if I do."}
{"text":"Hidden in plain sight, I was informed about Duck Donuts a few weeks ago. Now, I'm a regular and wish I lived closer so that I could make this a part of my morning routine. The cool thing about these donuts is that they are custom made. There are topping combinations that DD has come up with, such as Maple Bacon. DD also has a Donut of the Day. However, there is no discount and you can order any of these any day of the week.  I guess it's a way to get people to try something new. I personally like the Maple Bacon, which has glaze and bacon on it. The bacon is a nice compliment to the sweet on sweet donut. Donuts are only $1.20. I cannot overstate how good these donuts are. They are not overrated and you have to try it to understand the greatness that lies within. 

Being able to watch the donuts being made, this is also a place that kids seem to like. They get to watch the donut making process from start to finish, as they are fried fresh by the minute. The service here is great, as they seem accustomed to people asking several questions about how this process works. I'm sure it'll take awhile before not many people are new. DD also has various merchandise for sale, such as rubber ducks, shirts, etc. There isn't much space to sit down, so you don't want to come with a large group. Nevertheless, if you're lucky, there may be space for two. There are also two small table outside. I saw several people sitting on the sidewalk eating their donuts. If you haven't been to Duck Donuts, stop what you're doing Right Now and thank me later."}
{"text":"Messy, gooey and delicious. The smell alone in this place is intoxicating, but the donuts are even better. They have a great breakfast combo, 2 donuts and a coffee for $3.95 and it's a great deal for a simple, yet decadent breakfast. They have various \"donuts of the day\" (but you can get them any day of the week) and the ability for you to customize your own. 

The coffee is also very fresh and just a good cup of joe!"}
{"text":"Ducks Donuts only opened yesterday, but their process is smoother than other establishments with way more experience!

When we walked in, we filled out our order form and waited in line. Everyone was extremely patient. We placed our order and waited for our donuts to be prepared. 

There was a gentlemen (maybe manager? maybe owner) who was there helped all of the employees. He filled sprinkle containers, he grabbed boxes, he genuinely helped in any way that he could. He was pleasant, professional and appreciative. He thanked each customer that he could. He apologized for the wait, thanked us for our patience and our business. 

The donuts were delicious! They were fresh, fun and reasonably priced. Local bakeries charge $12 a dozen, so $13.50 for a dozen of custom donuts was way less than we were expecting. 

We all loved that you got to customize the donuts, my boyfriend doesn't eat chocolate so usually is automatically excluded from lots of options. It was so nice that he could swap out the icing and still enjoy the different combinations. 

The chocolate and vanilla frosting were really good, but more impressive were the strawberry and blueberry options. Usually fruit flavors are very artificial flavored, but these were not. 


I love supporting local businesses and am very appreciative of good food. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Omg these donuts are amazing . I have loved them since I have been little and visited them in the OBX . I can't believe they are finally here in Pittsburgh !!! I love peace love and little donuts too but duck donuts are bigger, better priced and all around the most delicious donuts ever !!!"}
{"text":"Warm and delicious. Build your own...So many options.  Friendly staff.  Received an extra donut because one was made incorrectly and they gave us that one, also with the explanation that is was incorrect and they wanted to know if we wanted to try it?"}
{"text":"Came here to see what the hype was about...the donuts are all cake donuts, you choose your glaze and topping on each.  They forgot one of my coconut toppings on my donut, but it was still ok. I honestly would get all pain, powdered, or just glazed next time to keep it simple.  The rest is all just extra sugar and makes the the donuts too sweet.  The best part is that they were warm."}
{"text":"For this place not to have a higher rating is complete insanity. 

I have absolutely nothing to do with the owners or management, and I have always been a huge fan of Dunkin' Donuts. I despise Krispy Kreme. I never thought I would like any doughnut better than Dunkin' Donuts, but Duck Donuts has taken the lead. If I was forced to describe these doughnuts in one word, it would be: Real. If I could use two words, they would be: Real and Soft. I guess that didn't tell you much since a lot of things can be Real and Soft. 

I wasn't looking forward to filling out a form to order, but I didn't have to do so. I walked straight up to the counter and ordered a Cinnamon Raisin and Vanilla Frosted with Sprinkles. They were so soft and tasty that I couldn't resist eating my doughnut as well as half the doughnut I bought for my son while on the way home. 

The service was excellent. I don't know why they need so many workers during off-peak hours, but if they can afford it, that's great. 

It's really difficult to describe doughnuts, but I can help you out: Go Here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the cake batter donuts served at Duck Donuts. Today I tried the maple bacon donuts for the first time and I was wow'ed. I hate to doubt the power of bacon but I never thought that It would taste that good on a donut. 

The line was long and the place was packed, but things went very quickly. The cashier was nice and efficient. The only issue I had was that due to the crowd and the small size of the store, you're going to find yourself in someone's way as you wait. Other than that, I enjoyed my first trip here and hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"This was a random stop for us on a Saturday morning out running errands. We had just had a semi-healthy lunch and wanted something sweet so we decided to share a doughnut. I know most people are probably rolling their eyes, but hey, I love sharing and didn't want a whole thing. 

We got our doughnut dipped in chocolate with peanut butter drizzle and chopped peanuts. It was hot and fresh, which was good. For me, it was a bit too rich and decadent, so I'm glad we shared. My boyfriend, however, could not get enough of it and mumbled the words \"awesome\" and \"delicious\" in between bites. 

Unfortunately, we both left our cell phones at home but suffice it to say, it was a pretty looking doughnut."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get donuts! I've had in Virginia Beach and was so happy to have a location so close to home. Donuts are always warm and fresh and very addicting!"}
{"text":"Unique donuts, cool breakfast sandwich, good coffee, clean, they have a small sitting area outside, great to sit and drink coffee and people watch"}
{"text":"Really think this place is okay. Its just like any other donut place. A bit pricey for the donuts. Not bad experience."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!!! Best donuts ever, even better than Krispy Kreme! A little pricey but worth it.  Cute shop, nice ambience.  They need more locations in town."}
{"text":"Warm gooey tasty yumminess. So good you dont even feel bad for eating bad. Go here eat all the doughnuts. You can create your own, get the pre made doughnuts or even a breakfast sandwich with doughnuts."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Duck Donuts in Duck, NC since I was a little kid. In my opinion, they're the best donuts you can get anywhere. I was hesitant to try them here because I didn't want to ruin a special vacation thing. But I have to admit it was nice to get a little taste of vacation. Once a year at the beach is just not often enough for these delicious donuts. 
If you go, step out of your typical donut order and try some of their creations. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Someone brought these to work and despite my best efforts I couldn't resist.  Boy,  this was probably one of the best moment of weakness', ever. (I have many....which are usually followed by regret....this was followed by happiness)Warm, fresh, delicious happiness. As a Canadian -   I've eaten a lot of donuts (what's a party without a Timbit?) That being said,  these are probably, some of the best donuts I have had. 

I will be going for more"}
{"text":"I have been excited to try this donut shop conveniently located in the new Siena complex. I was a little confused as they had clipboard erasable forms and then paper forms as well. I just took a paper form and designed two donuts. I ordered a blueberry glaze, graham cracker crumble, blackberry drizzle donut, and a vanilla glaze with shredded coconut donut. I was surprised at how cheap the donuts were as two donuts were only $2.40. They also had samples of their cake donut which was nice. My donuts were made very quickly and I was asked if I was satisfied with how they looked. Overall, I really liked the blueberry glaze on the donut, but was disappointed that by the time I was home the toppings had fallen off. The vanilla icing was too thick and took away from the shredded coconut. The donut itself is on the smaller side and not too dense, so you could easily eat two without thinking about it when they are nice and warm. Overall, a nice place to grab some donuts in the south hills."}
{"text":"Literally the best donut I have ever eaten. My favorites are the maple bacon and cinnamon sugar. Very cool to watch the donut go from batter to finished product in a couple minutes. I didn't really even like cake donuts before them."}
{"text":"I'm a true Dunkin fan, but who even remembers Dunkin after having a Duck Donut?! Oh my gosh, they are so good. You can order what you want by filling out a little sheet, or just order the recommended kinds. I usually mix it up and fill out my own order. I end up with something different every time and I've never been disappointed. Depending on what toppings you get, you can make a selection that isn't even that heavy. The office absolutely loves when I run by here in the morning!"}
{"text":"The donuts are very good and coffee fantastic.  What really stood out to me was the staff. They were welcoming, confident and adhered to food safety.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"So disappointed today. I have been here multiple time and today for some reason I saw something that wasn't sanitary. So this staff person came for outside washed her hands and proceeded to the assembly station. She did put gloves on and proceeded to prepare my order. I just happened to walk over to see the process and noticed that multiple times she pushed her glasses up on her face and grab a donut with that hand and placed them in the box. This is not sanitary!! Especially when you just came from outside. I informed the manager and she showed no empathy at all. Disgusting!! So I guest I have to bid farewell to this business unfortunately. It's one thing when you are not aware of what's going on with your food, but when you see what's going, it really turns you off."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoever invited the maple bacon donut is WICKED GENIUS!!!!! 

Mr. Scott was so nice to me when I told him I had never been there for. He suggested so many options and I'm so grateful for that. Great customer service goes along away ! 

If you're in the area or even just in Charlotte, NC stop by Duck's for a delicious treat"}
{"text":"So somebody please save me from Duck Donuts in Huntersville!  I had sampled DD's wares previously when someone brought them to a meeting from another location and before the one here in LKN had opened.  The tastes I had in that meeting made me happy to have tried them and happier that they came from a place far, far away from me so, no problem, right??

Now, I have a problem. DD is open nearby and while I've managed to only go twice, they are really darn good and that's saying a lot as those who know me know I don't have much of a sweet tooth.  And the really bad news...?  I have yet to enjoy them in the store when they are fresh and hot so once that happens, I fear it will be game over for moi and I'll be needing new pants!

Bottom line, great cake donuts that you can get iced and flavored and drizzled in any number of lovely combinations with my favorite so far being vanilla glaze, shredded coconut and fudge drizzle.  NOM!  Do yourself a no new clothes favor and don't go.  Or, WTH... Go for it and next size up be damned.  There's always salads to eat next week!

Thanks for coming to LKN Duck Donuts!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best donut places in Charlotte. I think I like Joe's Doughs and Pepperbox Donuts a little more, but I still love their donuts here. The biggest edge they have is that all of their donuts are served fresh off the line so they are warm when you get them. I like being able to customize and make my own donut. This is definitely a great stop for donuts!"}
{"text":"Early morning work event on a Saturday morning necessitates coffee and donuts...otherwise you are a terrible team leader. I was running kind of late and didn't really know what to order, but the staff at Duck Donuts were really helpful in explaining the pricing structure and giving flavor suggestions. As someone who gets ordering anxiety when I am in a line, no-one wants to be that annoying person taking forever, I really appreciate that they offer a paper menu where you can stand off to the side to mark your order. 

Ended up ordering a variety of donuts including maple bacon (the best thing ever), lemon/coconut, oreo cookie, and strawberry. Not sure about how they all tasted, but there were no leftovers which is a great indication of the quality!"}
{"text":"Freaky good donuts!! The fry them fresh for you and then you pick your glaze and toppings. The coconut was my favorite!! The cinnamon sugar w icing was so good too!! Must try if your in the area!!!"}
{"text":"As I drove by this Duck Donuts location I noticed the smiles of the satisfied customers through the window and decided to make a U-turn and check out the hype! 

We'll all I have to say is I now understand the expressions I saw!  I had no idea this type of goodness was going on in this place! 

The smell of hot fresh baked donuts filled my senses and made it hard for me to concentrate on what my next move would be, and that's when I met Sara the young lady behind the counter who helped me create the best donuts I have ever eaten! 

I watched in utter amazement as the artist behind the counter dunked, drizzled and laced piles of goodness on my donuts; upon completion I dashed to my car and headed home!

As I reached my destination and shared my fortune with my family, who with each succulent bite uttered words like \"OMG this is amazing and this is the best donut I've ever had!\" We are all looking forward to our next dozen!

Two thumbs up for Duck Donuts"}
{"text":"Not bad, but kind of mediocre. They're good about changing gloves and such if you tell them that you have an allergy (I can't do coconut), but I feel like the doughnuts would benefit from maybe having 3-4 different base flavors, instead of putting them all on the same flavor base. The maple bacon sounded a lot tastier than it was."}
{"text":"These fresh made-to-order donuts are DIVINE! The Bacon In the Sun is a MUST. Please be prepared to ruin your diet. Love this place."}
{"text":"It was tasty but it should have been eaten with a fork. It was not a hit with my young daughters... they'd prefer Dunkin. We enjoyed watching them be made but we did not enjoy the messiness while eating."}
{"text":"Go during the off-hours (we went on a Thursday night at about 7:30) because after watching them prepare our box of donuts, I can see why the lines are crazy in the mornings or on the weekend. 

First thing I noticed when I walked in was there was no display case. I was fully prepared to take an cliché picture of the colorful display case and post it on Instagram (I kid, but not really). Then I realized it was because they prepare your order in-house. Someone dips your hot donuts into the icing and puts the toppings on right then and there. 

Absolutely ridiculous cake-style donuts. Go. Reward yourself. Don't feel guilty about it."}
{"text":"These donuts are SO DELICIOUS! 11/10. They are even delicious the next day. Can't wait to go back! If it were closer to us we would be there all the time!! Everyone needs to experience these delicious donuts!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. All made to order and completely customizable. I love that they're all served warm. Reminded me of Krispy Kreme's hot nows, but with a lot more options on flavor. Favorite is the peanut butter icing with chocolate drizzle."}
{"text":"The donuts here are amazing- unsure of their management. I stopped in to get a gift card for a friend one evening. The lady at the register was very helpful. Then her manager stepped in and was incredibly rude to her and me. Left a bad taste in my mouth.

Not something I normally see here. Go and get the maple bacon."}
{"text":"Duck Donuts is definitely a unique idea. They give you endless options to customize donuts the way you like. The place was clean and definitely busy. However I was not impressed by the donuts. Everyone has different taste buds and they just didn't impress mines. The service/workers was average nothing to brag home about. Also I consider myself to be a pretty smart person however after staring at the order form a little I finally figured out the concept just before I got ready to ask for help. LoL. I most likely won't return however as I said I am sure a lot will because it was busy for the most part."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had. I almost don't have words. The actual dough of the donut was the lightest and fluffiest ice ever had in my life. The way it works is you choose the toppings you want on top so you can mix and match which is fun. 
We went with maple bacon, smore, chocolate and coconut, and cinnamon sugar. 
Hands down the best donut was the maple bacon. Everyone knows how great of a combination those flavors are but holy moly. Their bacon is actually super high quality and sets off the sweetness. 
The other donuts were delicious as well, but I'm going back for the maple bacon."}
{"text":"Umm...where have you been my whole life?? These donuts are delicious!! The variety is wonderful, the staff is friendly, and the donuts are HOT! 
Parking could be a little difficult and there may be a line, but find a spot and get in line it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Cake donuts made to order. Warm, moist, light & not sickening sweet. Perfect cakiness texture. They make donuts right in front of you. These are dazzling cake gems. Highly recommend!! Five star worthy if service was more welcoming & friendly."}
{"text":"Donuts made to order with any icing, drizzles, or toppings you like!  Best part is, their cake donut is so perfectly delicious with ever so slightly crispy outside and chewy inside that any combination of sauce/toppings will always result in an excellent donut!"}
{"text":"Maple bacon is definitely number one! The peanut butter is good too. If you want to make your staff happy, take a dozen to go and they will love you forever. Keep supporting local."}
{"text":"I know you all are going to hate me for this but needless to say I wasn't to thrilled about this place. It is basically take out but they have a couple of tables if you want to eat in. First of all I want to preface that whatever they make here is made with donuts.

When I arrived I ripped off a sheet where you can choose the number of donuts you want, toppings, glaze, and drizzle. They were giving out samples of sugared cinnamon donuts which I thought was a bit too much for me. Oh yes, they are also into souvenir shopping if you want to buy Tees and little rubber duckies. Some even have Pittsburgh written on it.

If you want a breakfast sandwich you can have it made with donuts. Care for a sundae? You can have a donut base with it. They do offer one special for $5.00 with the purchase of two donuts and a beverage. Since I was planning to go out to lunch I was only interested in a plain simple blueberry donut without all the frills. Coffee and tea is available from self serve machines.

i went to pay for my donut which came to a grand total of $1.40 since I didn't want all the stuff that you can get with it. Yes, if you customize it you pay more. They also provide the calorie count of each item if you are watching your weight or carbs. I was then given a number and in a few minutes my donut was served to me boxed.

The only good thing I liked about it was that it was soft and warm since it was made fresh. But it had no blueberry taste to it whatsoever. It just tasted like a plain donut! Hey if I'm buying a blueberry donut then I would expect to see some tiny pieces in it or at least taste it. Since I needed to be somewhere I didn't get the opportunity to complain about this matter.

I'm not a big donut fan but I do know that I prefer cake donuts to glazed over anytime. This store is a novelty and again I feel it is to bring something different in this new mall they are creating off Siena Dr. Expect long lines because people are usually ordering up to a dozen to take home and it is family oriented. Located next to the new Nothing Bundt cakes they are open early am through mid afternoon."}
{"text":"Just under a 5 rating on most counts. (I initially scored it a 4 but went back to change to a 5 after reading my own review before posting.) Innovative concept- although probably inspired by Krispy Kreme's operating equipment to form and cook the donuts so you can get a just-made warm product. 

Basic in that there is only one real donut type made, with the variety coming in the eyes of the customer who chooses a glaze and a topping. For me, the peanuts topping beat out the bacon one, but it's all personal. No filled donuts offered. 

Normally one finds cake donuts dry. But the beauty here is how moist and rich they taste. Cooked to slightly underdone, I assume on purpose, they were incredibly delicious. 

Only negative might be that they can become cloyingly sweet after a gob of glaze. Maybe next time I'll try a plain one.  

I applaud them on pricing. Individual donuts are $1.20 each, certainly enough for a good profit, but reasonable for this special treat- and probably why there can be crowds inside (wait goes quickly though)."}
{"text":"It's a little high for basic glazed doughnuts but go for the maple bacon doughnuts and it doesn't get much better than. Save time and order ahead. All nuts are great!!"}
{"text":"I've frequented the Dilworth location many times and have never been disappointed.  I just visited Huntersville and my donuts weren't warm, at all.  The vanilla glaze didn't even melt.  I might as well have purchased donuts from the grocery store.  I'm not sure if this is an operational issue or the fact that I visited about 45 minutes before closing...but either way it will probably be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"I've been trying to visit this gem for months and I finally made it during Sunday rush.  Despite the cheerful chaos and I line nearly out the door, service was prompt and pleasant.  The donuts are quality! They aren't too \"cakey\" or dry.  They're wonderful light buy surprisingly filling. The glaze and topping combos you can create are so fun.  And although in sure its been stated many times,  try the maple glaze with bacon on top.
Also,  this shop it's located in such a cool area. Treat yourself to an exploratory walk after you visit."}
{"text":"Damn good Donuts! We got a glaze, glaze with rainbow sprinkles, cinnamon bun, snores, strawberry lemonade, and vanilla Oreo. No picture of the masterpieces because they looked so pretty that I simply forgot! 

I came here on a Sunday afternoon and they were pretty busy. It can be a little chaotic because the waiting space and the line sort of blend together. Staff members were nice. Parking is kind of tricky but if you're familiar with the area, you understand the struggle! 

These donuts are essentially cake that is customized. Plan to get atleast half a dozen because they are tasty! We didn't eat them until later in the day and simply put them in the microwave for a few seconds when ready to eat and they were delicious. Since they are cake like, you don't have to refrigerate them. 

Overall, these are some delicious donuts and I'm so glad that they opened up further North because going to Dilworth was a hike."}
{"text":"Went into location to order half a dozen donuts and then realized I had left my wallet at home. Then I remembered Apple Pay. The young man at the register was courteous but didn't know how to accept Apple Pay. He asked another coworker and she really didn't seem very helpful because she stated someone had tried to use it before and it didn't work and that was that as she proceeded to walk into the back. The nice cashier had to tell her that he didn't know how to process an Apple Pay payment. She seemed as if she was being bothered. 

She went to the register and told me to place my phone by the card reader and then she was like, \"See, it's not working.\"  WOW!!!!! For an establishment to accept a method of payment but not how to utilize the system floored me. You'd think after the other customer attempted they would have done some troubleshooting and fixed the error. 

Because of that young ladies attitude and lack of customer service I will never visit the location again."}
{"text":"\"Assortment - we choose\" turns out to be pretty vile.  I wanted to be quick and not custom order each donut so I choose the DD assortment thinking that they would have a defined variety. NOPE!  Apparently they just pick the closest flavors and icings with no thought to the outcome.  A couple were edible but with combos like orange icing with bacon, strawberry with Oreo crumbs, peanut butter with chocolate and carmel my family couldn't stomach most of them.  What a disappointment.  

Please design a \"standard\" assortment of good combos.  Don't let your staff continue to do this."}
{"text":"Best donuts everrrrrrrr! Seriously, if I didn't think the cashier would give me a weird look, I would be happy wth just a plain donut, no toppings. They are fluffy and hot, with a perfectly crisp outside. My first few times I got a million toppings, but these things are gonna fill you up. I'm always hopeful I can eat two, but alas. Parking is usually not a problem, but sometimes it can be really busy. We were there one time during a rush, and even then our wait in line and to pick up was really reasonable. It gave us time to debate our toppings."}
{"text":"I LOVE donuts, and even more I LOVE cake donuts.  Duck Donuts prepares donuts throughout the day, but awaits you to select your choices.  How awesome is that? Fresh, toppings made to your order donuts.  As others have said this definitely ensures your donut is fresh.  There are so many choices I love them all.  A great addition to the Dilworth area and a definite morning, or even afternoon treat!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love these donuts. My birthday was a few weeks ago, and not only did my roommates wake me up with Duck Donuts...but one of my best friends from Austin, TX called in favors and had these delivered to my doorstep. An embarrassing but factual testament to how much I talk about these donuts and LOVE them. Warm, fresh, and every toping combination is great. Personal Favs: Strawberry icing, rainbow sprinkles, raspberry glaze or chocolate icing, coconut flakes and salted caramel drizzle."}
{"text":"Good Donuts.   The plain naked donut is simple and delicious.   Add some of your favorite flavors, toppings, icing, etc... and you got a real tasty donut.  Seems like they are putting out new flavors regularly.  It's best to know what flavors you want before you get up to the order counter.   The employees are patient, but sometimes the people behind you in line aren't.  ;) 

They have coffee that is fine.  Nothing fancy but pairs well with the donuts.  

Downside to this spot. Lack of inside seating.   Very crowded inside.    Otherwise great.   They are quick and professional and generally friendly."}
{"text":"Loved their donuts.  Fresh and delicious.  A staff member preparing the donuts had rubbed her fingers on her nose with gloves on and I asked her to change it before making our order.  Of course they're probably just teenagers and got an attitude sliding our donuts across the counter when it was done.  I believe the manager was on site but disregarded how her employees were doing.  If you work in a place where you are preparing something, I would recommend being aware of where your hands have been.  It's not very appetizing to see someone make your donuts after rubbing her nose."}
{"text":"Tried A Variety Of Donuts, My Favorites Ended Up Being The Maple Bacon And Vanilla Oreo...Would Definitely Return And Recommend To Others.  Are they better than Krispy Kreme???  Most definitely.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"I've been on the search for an amazing donut in Charlotte and now I can confidentiality say it has arrived. The cat is out of bag or rather the duck because this place was packed! Don't worry the line goes fast and well worth the wait. I got the Strawberry frosted donut with bacon sprinkles. My stomach has never been so happy. You basically start with the donut and pick your frosting flavor then topping. As you wait for your donut you can watch them make your donut through the glass. The staff was friendly and genuinely happy to serve us our first Duck Donut."}
{"text":"Happened upon this spot on the way to Good Bottle even though I know they serve them there on Saturday mornings. Got the maple bacon donut  on the suggestion of cashier. Man it was awesome, want to try PB icing next time and some new combinations of donuts. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Oh jeez. These donuts rock. They're like an addiction. An addiction made worse in the fact that you can customize your own donuts. Holy moly! Talk about delicious overload.
This is mind-blowing good sweetness.
Whenever someone brings them to the office the frenzy of cube dwellers trying to grab one is similar to watching pigeons fight over a crumb of bread.
Go get you some Duck Donuts!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two dozen assorted and a bucket of coffee for a work meeting. They had it ready the exact time I asked for it to be ready and they helped me walk it out to my car. Everyone in the meeting loved the donuts. Delicious and really great customer service!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'm not buying the hype.  My inner fat kid refuses to rate a doughnut shop anywhere below 3 stars, but the reality is that I just wasn't impressed.  

Having been to Duck Donut locations along the coast, I'm not sure why I thought this one would be much different.  Let me clarify by saying up front that this is just my opinion.  To each his own, but I don't dig \"caky\" doughnuts.  Keep it flaky, not caky.  Think Krispy Kreme.  Are you with me?  Anyhow, caky it is at this place.

Again, my experience was less than stellar.  It had been years since I last visited an OBX location, so I needed a refresher on how things worked.  The employee behind the counter gave me a look as though I had just asked him to multiply 3,288 by 1,787 in his head.  Eventually I figured out that the doughnuts aren't sitting in a window to be selected until sellout.  Each doughnut essentially has the same caky base, and is then \"topped\" with your selections in an effort to transform them into something else.  Want a chocolate doughnut?  Well, you're gonna get a cake doughnut topped with warm chocolate goo.  Basically a cake hot from the oven that was frosted too soon, creating a soup like consistency that can hardly be called icing.  Not.  A.  Fan.  It's a literal hot mess.  Giving one of these to anyone under the age of 14 is just asking for it.  Hopefully you have baby wipes handy because no napkin in the world could clean up the aftermath.  I myself had little paper pieces stuck between my fingers clinging to chocolate schma, after the closest napkin disintegrated in my hands, until I could get to a sink.  That was after eating only half the doughnut, as the warm chocolate goo started to make me nauseous.  

The shop is tucked back in the never lands of the Kenilworth Commons shopping center.  Seating in the place is limited.  The coffee was nothing special.  The lack of service was mind-blowing considering the place had yet been open a week when I visited.  After paying, I awaited my doughnuts and coffee only to realize that the cashier should've given me my coffee cup.  I went back over to claim said cup, but he was still clamoring to find the solution to 3,288 X 1,787.  Hopeless. 

BTW, in case you were wondering, 3,288 X 1,787 = 5,875,656
You're welcome."}
{"text":"Staff is AMAZING and the donuts are even better! I had a company event the next day and they did not bat an eye and having my order ready for pick up in the morning! All of our staff raved about the donuts and it made the event a success. Thanks Duck Donuts for making us stand out!"}
{"text":"I love how the donuts are made fresh to order! We walked in today to find the store packed, but the lines went by pretty fast so that's no biggie. Even though I was tempted to get a half dozen, we walked away with a simple two donuts today. The bf ordered the bare (surprisingly good for being a plain, unglazed donut) and a maple with chopped peanuts. It's $1.20 per single donut. The box came out hot, almost too hot to hold. But YUM, so fresh and not oily at all. The glazes are extremely sweet, I'd hold off on icing if you have sensitive teeth. 

We will be back for more...hopefully before or after the gym so I don't feel too guilty. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. I tried to get one of each variety and there was not a loser in the bunch. My favorite so far is maple with bacon."}
{"text":"Everything is soooo amazingly fresh. The workers are very courteous and the taste is amazing definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great donuts. The restaurant is in a peaceful place and you can go eat outside on a nice area"}
{"text":"This place as been in my bookmarks for months and months. There was a huge line when I  walked in, and it's definitely not a grab-and-go type of place. You need to wait a while, but that's because the donuts are made to order.

I ordered a dozen to try out some flavors and to share, and a coffee since you can check in on yelp and get a free coffee! 

Something happened with my ticket and I ended up waiting around for 15-20 minutes. At first, because this was my first time, I thought it just took THAT long. But I kept seeing people leave with their donuts before me. I asked the girl about it, and she didn't have my ticket at all. They were very apologetic and worked on them right away.

The donuts were tasty, but they are cake batter donuts, so they get a little heavy after attempting to eat more than one at a time. I think it's a wonderful shop and a great idea to have so many customizable options. I don't think I'd make a special trip down here, but I'd definitely have them again!"}
{"text":"YES! We came here on a weekend morning, so we expected the line to be crazy! There were lots of people but it didn't take too long to get our order in and for us to devour one of our donuts before heading home.

I've gone to the location in Charlotte, and I'm so glad it's up here in Huntersville. The donuts are delicious, and there's something about getting to choose your toppings and really custom make them. 

I've read lots of reviews on how some people like cake donuts and some like the fluffier type. Duck Donuts are definitely the cake type. Personally, I prefer the fluffy, light version of Krispy Kreme to these kinds of donuts. However, if you give a girl a donut, I will steal it from her and eat it. It also didn't stop me from ordering a dozen of them... oops!

If you've never been here before, just know what type of dough you're getting. I'd 100% come back when I'm feeling the donut craving."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had.... Very cake like and so many favors to try... Definitely a cheat day meal and I love it. So happy they are growing in locations."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start out saying, I actually don't like donuts. Or at least not til now. Hate Krispy Kreme. Can't stand grocery store versions. I've just never liked them. I tried both the maple bacon and the glazed with Oreo versions today. If this is what donuts truly are supposed to taste like, count me in. Im so sad this doesn't exist where I live. I'd be there every weekend."}
{"text":"Cool idea for a donut spot where they make them right in front of you. This place is cheap (in a good way) and has great coffee as well. In the mornings this place is packed with soccer moms and families, but the lines move fast and the cashiers are quick."}
{"text":"The donuts are definitely a 5 star, the service today was a 1 star.  I ordered 4 light cinnamon sugar donuts with sugar only on the top.  I got three with mountains  of sugar on all of the donuts and in the box (looked like a cat litter box).  I said I ordered 4, and only with light sugar on the top.  With an attitude the woman took back the box. She took the three donuts and shook them into the current box that I was given, with the gobs of sugar already in the box.  So now I have donuts with sugar on the top and bottom.  I said to the lady I only want a light sprinkle on the top only with 4 donuts, not 3.  Not only did I get an attitude, I got the stare of how dare you ask me to fix you something the way you asked for/ paid for.  As I said the donuts are amazing, the service needs to be worked on.  I will give them another chance, but would definetly stop coming if this type of service continues."}
{"text":"these donuts are super hard to beat, they are super good. They melt into your mouth!!!!!!!!!!! I love Dunkin Donuts and they are ten times better"}
{"text":"In comparison to other local donut shops, Duck Donuts is my least favorite. The owner is great, and overall the service and donuts are as well. Only issue is that it's just 1 king of plain donut with different types of toppings. I prefer actual variety of donuts to choose from like Joes Doughs or Your Moms Donuts in Matthews."}
{"text":"This place is seriously perfect. The staff is so friendly and amazing, and I love how you can literally watch everything being made. I love the flavor options, and the cake donut is just ridiculously good. It's sounds gross, but I'm sure I could eat a half dozen because they are just too delicious to stop. Oh, and the donuts are still warm when they serve them to you. Oh yea AND they have donut samples while you wait. They don't skimp on the toppings either, they just load everything on there. I want to go back every morning."}
{"text":"They say first impressions set the standard. I was excited to try the famous Ducks this morning. Ordered coffee, a donut and a breakfast sandwich.  When it came to being served - coffee, check. Donut, check. And then I waited for my sandwich. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. You get the point.  I ended up leaving - after having paid - because I got tired of waiting.  I believe in second chances so I may find my way back - but as of today, I'm not a happy customer."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Duck Donuts but it won't be my last!!! All I can say is WOW! The service was awesome, friendly and fast... I'm glad I only got a half dozen this time cause I would have eaten any leftovers, but once I got them to home, the family devoured them so no worry on overindulging... love that they post the calorie counts on the board too. Definitely a treat worth eating once in a while. Repeat customer for sure! Welcome to the neighborhood Duck Donuts :-)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get donuts in the city. There are hundreds of ways to top house donuts. I love this place so much, before I left for Ghana I bought a dozen to introduce my family abroad a chance to try them. They loved them. The bacon maple is the way to go. But I always get a vanilla with raspberry and coconut."}
{"text":"The donuts themselves were delicious,since made to order they are served warm and they just melt in your mouth. I tried the cinnamon bun which was dipped in cinnamon sugar and drizzled with vanilla. My daughter had vanilla dipped with rainbow sprinkles. 
     My issue was with our visit and the lack of assistance and friendliness. This was our first visit and expected some explanation on how the process or menu worked. I don't believe we were even greeted. With a \"touristy\" place like this I expected more. We tried to navigate our way through it and why we only ended up ordering 2 to go.because it was overwhelming. We wanted to eat there however they only have 2 tables. We did see the customize order sheets after the fact while I was getting my iced tea. The girl who took our order seemed less than enthused about being there. There was one woman who called our order number that was very nice and friendly.  
    I hope if we go back our 2nd visit is as good as their donuts."}
{"text":"We have known Duck Donuts from all our vacations in the Outer Banks. Our tradition is a trip to DD the first morning we are there. The donuts are the best. The Siena store doesn't disappoint. Made fresh right there they were still warm when we got home. They are made to order with the topping of choice. We will be visiting Duck Donuts frequently. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"We had Duck Donuts brought to our work yesterday and they were INCREDIBLE!  Crisp on the outside - soft and fluffy on the inside.  And apparently these are customized?!  I'm told they were made fresh to order. What can be better???"}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised and pleased with my visit to Duck Donuts! It was a very creative place that I have never experienced elsewhere. I had so much fun creating my own donut and I would give it 5 stars for the taste! Even having the donut serve warm took it to the next level and I definitely will return to make a new creation again!"}
{"text":"Best donuts around.  The donuts are all cake donuts, you choose your glaze and topping on each.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with the aroma of fresh donuts.  Anyone who is local or passing though should try this place out.  Would recommend trying as many combos as possible.  There honestly isnt a bad donut combo."}
{"text":"I had to see what all the hype was about, and I have never seen made to order donuts in my life. Outstanding is all I can say thanks to my coworker for pointing it out."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Charlotte donut scene. Yes, I know Duck's is a chain, but they are doing donuts right.These are cake donuts so don't expect a krispy kreme. I've been here twice now and happy every time. They have a simple concept and they don't try and be fancy. Pick your type of cake donuts and frosting and pick it up at the end of the bar. Simple and sweet. For 1.20, this is a great little treat! Also, if you heat up the donuts as the box recommends it's heavenly. The staff is friendly, the donuts are fresh and the line is quick. 
For the price of Dunkin' I'll take Duck's any day."}
{"text":"I am sure the donuts are great but we never got that far.  We decided to stop in after receiving coupons for BOGO coffee and donuts.  After waiting in line, we asked the girl at the register what coffee we could order and she said any of them.  We proceeded to order coffee and donuts.  She became confused as to how to put in the coupons and called the manager over.  He then told us we could only have regular coffee.  OK fine.  Then said and you can't order donuts too.  Seriously??  He was impolite and not at all accommodating.  

Totally understand rules but please train your employees and do not embarrass them.  AND if you say yes, honor your commitment and do not make a scene with customers.  Customer service goes a LONG way and there are choices out there.   Unfortunately, we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Duck Donuts = Delicious Cake Batter Donuts. You can depend on that they will always be hot and warm, because they are made to order. Does it get any better than that?

If you come on a weekend morning, just prepare yourself. It will be crowded. And you will have to wait in line. But you can stand there and watch the magic happen. This also gives you time to decide what you want. And if you can't decide what kind of donut you want, since you can make any combo from all their choices of toppings - ask for a dozen of randoms and they will create the perfect combinations for you.

Also - did you know they do donut holes? You have to call in the day prior and it does a require a minimum order of 10 dozen holes which is right around $30 or so. I can't recall the exact price now. But these are perfect for an office or school setting."}
{"text":"BEST donuts everrrr!!! They are vanilla cake donuts and you can customize your toppings! And they are always warm, made fresh! So freaking good!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!i visited there a few months ago and thought I write the review then but I still think about my experience. I was visiting Tampa and soooo wish I lived close to get them regularly! We got a mixture but they were all delicious! A def must to try!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge donut buff. Being from Texas, that's the one thing I missed moving to Charlotte--donut shops that AREN'T Dunkin Donuts(btw I used to worked there--donuts are two days old by the time they sell them). Anyways, these are exactly what I've been missing back home. Fresh, hot, amazingly-gooey, sugary donuts. I had them a couple times when my boyfriend brought them home to me but I promise there is not other experience like actually going in, ordering them and watching them get made. I promise they taste 1000x better if you're apart of the process. I got a maple bacon donut and that was normal. I love it."}
{"text":"Stopped in pouring rain at 6:30am Columbus Day after a stay at the Crown Plaza. 
These donuts remind me of the fried cakes from the old 1980's Downey Flake in Syr, NY. 
We got ours as cinnamon sugared. 
Fabulous, little crisp & tender inside. 
I would say though - I think the frosting toppings are foolish as they will melt. 
But powdered sugar & cinnamon wonderful! 
Their coffee was good as well."}
{"text":"Waaaaaaa, freaking best donuts ever! People are always bringing these beauties into the office for every event, birthdays, retirements, anniversary's, bar mitzvahs, graduation of their second cousin twice removed....EVERYTHING. They are soft but a chewy soft and have several flavors: sprinkles, chocolate with sprinkles, glaze, plain, bacon covered, the works."}
{"text":"I worked out extra hard this week so I wouldn't feel bad about devouring a few donuts. But I suggest walking here if you're already in the area (2 block radius) because parking isn't friendly here. 

The donuts are warm and the variety of toppings will allow you to get your creative mind going. I ordered half a dozen (all different combinations including the maple bacon) and that totaled to about $8. 

However, I've always come early in the morning before the rush of the day, so visiting during a wonderful Spring afternoon isn't something I will probably do again. It was busy and the cashier seemed annoyed.

A Duck Donut will place a smile on your face and satisfy your sweet tooth, so if you're wanting to give a local place a try on donuts then go check them out."}
{"text":"Donuts made in front of you, covered in sauces and toppings. What more do you need to know. Go now."}
{"text":"No complaints, all smiles. I'm the mother of a doughnut obsessed child, so I made a mental note to take her to this place to see if she would love it. The simple method of being able to create whatever combination of flavored available is enough to get most people excited, especially a child. I waited a week after the opening hoping the crowds would ease up a bit. We got there mid afternoon, and there were only a few other patrons inside which gave her enough time to decide what she wanted.

A short time later, the number was called and she received her box full of warm goodies. At first bite, she was in love. They were warm and looked absolutely delicious. My heart lies with cupcakes, so I didn't have any of her doughnuts, I was just happy she enjoyed them.

She says she's never going back to Krispy Kreme again."}
