{"text":"Food - Excellent! Service - Excellent!  Cool looking coffee mugs without a handle - Very bad idea:("}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place on a random Saturday brunch with friends. I had the donuts for an app and a giant \"bowl\" of coffee. My wife appreciated the fact that they had a barista and ordered an Americano. For the meal be sure you order something with bacon. They cure it themselves and it's tender and delicious. A friend had the grits with rabbit meat and he loved it. Said it was a little spicy. Definitely a hipster hole but we had a great experience and a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic brunch experience!  I recently visited and found Little Spoon to be a charming option for weekend brunch.  The potatoes are excellent, and the frittata (a special that day) was delicious.  I also recommend the 8-minute cookies - fabulous for a sweet tooth!  Yes, parking is a challenge, but that is true for many businesses in the area."}
{"text":"Why did I try this place again?! A friend of mine suggested it, and since it had been a few months since my last visit, I thought maybe it had gotten better since then and wanted to give it another chance. While it's not any worse than it was, it's definitely not any better. My impressions of this experience:  --There were only maybe 4 or 5 other tables in the place, yet both times I wanted a refill on my coffee, I had to request one. This was in spite of the fact that our server had been to our table to check on us and must have seen that our cups were empty. He was right on top of taking payment once we finished our food, though.  --The server was nice, however, and made sure to check that over easy eggs on the BEC sandwich were ok for my pregnant friend to eat.  --The coffee was still really good. The coffee and the friendliness were the only really good things about this visit. Everything else was eh.  --The BEC sandwich cost $8 and was about the same size as a Starbucks breakfast sandwich (which costs half as much) but didn't even taste as good. The slab of bacon (which was ham-style, super thick bacon) was greasy and flavorless. The whole thing was just bland and seemed like it needed some kind of sauce or seasoning. While I can appreciate the fact that this is a farm-to-table, sit-down dining experience, I would expect to get something at least as good if not better tasting than what a giant chain coffee shop is offering.   --The menu is still in that weird, hard-to-decipher format. My friend couldn't figure out what to order because they're still just listing ingredients and neglecting preparation/presentation. I sort of knew what to expect, but some of the newer items were totally cryptic.  --\"Liver mush\" has got to be the most disgusting name for a dish that I've ever heard. It might be good. I wouldn't know, because the name sounded so awful that I didn't dare try it.  Little Spoon continues to be an okay experience at a premium price. I love the location. I love the space. PLEASE step up the food game and make your menu format more approachable! It baffles me that such good ingredients are being used to prepare such average-tasting items. This place could and should be miles better."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch spot in Charlotte. It's brunch heaven. They play hip hop music, it's farm to table and the food is made with nothing but love.   I would recommend the BTF, the brussels, roll ups and the doughnuts. My bf absolutely loved his tomato sandwich, as in he started dancing after his first bite lol! Oh and did I mention how good  the mimosas are? All champagne with a splash of OJ.   Little spoon is truly the place to go for brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food was under seasoned.  Needed salt and pepper of which there was none readily available. The blackberry pop tart was seasoned too strongly with lavender. I also like being able to drink my coffee using only one hand. They obviously use top notch ingredients which is nice.  Cute concept."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly service from a gentleman in his late-thirties/early forties wearing a pork pie hat."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte, and we popped into this spot for a quick brunch. Loved it!   Walking up the playlist was an instant hit to what vibe could be expected. Easy going.   The food was great! I had the brussel spouts and Wings- great decision. Some of the other things on our table were the chicken biscuits(drool worthy), the donuts (actually 3 donut holes so don't be fooled), and the potatoes. Their mimosas were awful. Our carafe came out looking like a pure bottle of champagne and separated particles of a powdery orange juice? I loosely use the term juice.   Back to the food....... GO HERE! It was so delicious in every sense of the word."}
{"text":"This place has a great location. The food was pretty tasty, but if you are hungry or hangry an entree will not fill you up! (The portions are small). Also, do not order the cookies from the dessert menu. They are cookies that you can make at home and they  are thin and crumbly. I think they give you four? Either way, order something else."}
{"text":"Summary: Overpriced food for average quality food and below average service.   First try: First time they said they were full. The restaurant had a few tables occupied. When we asked about this, they said that they had reservation for all the tables in 30 mins and they did not want to rush us.   Second try: We were the first at the restaurant and they proceeded to jam people around, us with the restaurant being empty. Tried the donuts, too expensive for 3 tiny donut holes which tasted like microwaves Krispy Kreme donuts.  The menu says CHICKEN BISCUIT, but they give you two. The server did a great job upselling  the pork belly bacon, but when the menu implies 1 chicken biscuit we assumed a $2 charge. However they serve 2 biscuits so they charge $4 - deceptive. The biscuit was extremely good, the chicken was too small to taste the flavor. I had to open the biscuit to see if they put on the chicken.   My wife had the STICKY RICE and it the rice was not sticky and too sweet.   Atmosphere: table rocked (they tried to fix) the floor was extremely dirty for being there 5 mins after opening and the music was too loud with a lack of diversity of genres."}
{"text":"The shrimp raft is one of the best dishes  I've ever had. The flavorful juice on the bottom of the bowl creates a not too soggy texture on the bottom of the ciabatta toast that's spread with salt pepper garlic butter. Topped with crunchy arugula, shrimp sautéed perfectly and don't forget a sunny side up egg to top it all off. Incredible!!!! And slab bacon and Korean Brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Food was good, music was bad.  Restaurant has a decent and simple menu.  I had heard mixed reviews prior to going here for the first time.  Choice of foods is limited, however, everything that we offered was good.  Atmosphere is a bit odd, however, mostly driven by the loud music which is less than tolerable on a good day.  Think bad and loud grudge music from the late 90's.  Not sure who the intended audience is, but it's loud and bad and not Nirvana."}
{"text":"Put a freakin handle on the coffee cups! It's not hipster to burn your fingers every time you sip your drink."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a restaurant that I give 5 stars across the board. littlespoon has an awesome vibe, great staff and service, absolutely dank food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try out Little Spoon for breakfast and finally did today. Our expectation was that it would be a little pretentious and slightly overpriced, and it was. The food was both delicious and disappointing. We had two big cups of tea, served in oversized handleless cups. The corn bread muffins with chocolate chips were dry and did not come out until after our entrees even though we'd requested them first. The chicken biscuits were big and filling - my husband ate only one. The porridge was heavy on creamy coconut milk so it felt more soupy -- I like it thicker and grainier. The diced green apple on top was a genius touch to break up the cloying coconut milk. However, as I progressed through the bowl, the milk tasted more like clotted coconut cream and was unfinishable. If you love coconut milk this may not bother you. Our total was $35. Because we'd ordered dense foods we were full and still had a chicken biscuit and two muffins to take home."}
{"text":"As an experienced food service employee, this is my take...  Unsanitary, over-priced, pretentious.  The coffee was good. $3. The mugs did not have handles.  If I did not have \"server hands\" myself, I would have burned them trying to pick up the darn thing. BEC on a burger bun. Yes, a frickin burger bun. $9.  Yes, $9 for a BEC on a burger bun. The bacon was actually pork belly.  It was very tough for pork belly.  The dishes, glasses and silverware were speckled with food particles like they were not changing the water in the dishwasher frequently enough (commercial washers use the same water over and over but it needs changing regularly). There was a cell phone on the expo counter.  Cell phones are frequently used to pass the time while passing your last meal, if you catch my drift.  Poop!!! The food expo guy shook hands with a customer and went straight back to handling plates of food without washing his hands.  I asked for the WiFi password but the waitress forgot to tell me.  Servers should have it memorized. A customer asked a waitress to stand in a high stool and take a picture of him and his food, in a to go box?  What?! The old skool rap and hip hop was kinda nostalgic but it was so loud I'm now deaf.  It was really loud. The waitress did not mention the specials. They make you pay at the table on a tablet.  It's uncomfortable to be forced to complete your transaction with the waitress just standing there holding a screen in your face. The expo delivered my food and asked if I needed anything and forgot to bring/send the hot sauce I requested.  This was either May 21st or 22nd."}
{"text":"Had a sub par meal yesterday.  Trying way too hard to be trendy , seems to have forgotten about making sure good is actually good. Got the bacon egg sandwich, buns burnt on one side, slab bacon not edible , egg way over cooked. Also got chicken lettuce cups with creamy cole slaw . Cold slaw was basically some large shreds of carrot and cabbage . Not creamy. Chicken was dry , lettuce tasted old.   Patio was fun, service was good ."}
{"text":"So I'm going to start with the most obvious complaint.  No handles on the coffee cups.  Seriously bad move for anyone who drinks coffee black.  However, while they serve coffee in bowls, they serve porridge in coffee cups with handles.  Seriously.    Then there is the tea selection, which in a word, stinks.  Especially when the waitress made such a big production out of bringing the selections out for me to choose from.  Four teas are not a selection.  Trust me, since I drink hot tea daily, four teas, in bags no less, is a joke.  You want to charge the prices on the menu, I expect a teapot with a special house blend like chamomile lavender and served with a tea strainer.  The menu... Well to be honest, overpriced and pretentious might be a kind way to say this.  Yes, this is farm to table, which is a great concept. Hey, I even grew up on a farm, so I can really appreciate that. But the menu was unimaginative. And realistically, $16 for a BLT?  I live in DC, and that's what I expect there. Nothing personal, if you want to charge that, it needs to be way better, like best food on the planet better, and in a space where I'm not listening to crap music that's so loud it's not very easy to converse with my friends.  Finally, the bill.  Only it is on a tablet the waitress held for us, and she simply announces how much it is.  Then she swipes the card for you then, turns it towards you to confirm one of 3 preset tip amounts, the lowest being 18%.  So you think being somewhat average deserves 18%? No.  The you use your finger to sign the screen.  And you have to request a copy of the receipt. If you are worried about paper, email it to people.  And what ever happened to letting me review my bill and pay at my leisure?  As my friend puts it, this restaurant is trying too hard to be edgy and instead comes off as pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious.  Quite honestly, go elsewhere and have a better brunch you can enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"Was incredibly excited to try this place from all the reviews, but the wait was ridiculous. The hostess told us the wait would be 30-40 minutes. After an hour and 10 minutes, we were still not seated."}
{"text":"Great place with the best coffee and breakfast in town. Most negative reviews are by people who don't seem to understand the concept nor the cuisine. I have always had great service and can't say enough nice things about this restaurant and its staff. Get the hot pocket or the bole."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch twice and both times it was phenomenal. As it is a farm to table restaurant the menu changes often so what I write about may not be on the menu anymore.  However if you go and they have the pork belly bacon just GET IT. Perfectly cooked, kinda sweet but kinda spicy. In all honestly it's the freshest most delicious bacon I've ever had.  The baked eggs in pomodaro sauce was out of this world. Just like my grandma used to make the day after Italian feasts and I was delighted to see someone on the area doing it the right way. We call it eggs in purgatory they had a different name for it that I cannot remember at the moment.   Little spoon is one of the new places that is a must try in the emerging Charlotte food scene."}
{"text":"First, the food at Little Spoon is great. I had the hash and a Chai and was delighted with the delicious meal. Second, the wait staff was top notch...friendly, quick, and helpful. I also liked that they all have tablets, so your order is immediately sent to the kitchen and, if you're paying with a card, they can swipe it at the table  That said, the price, especially for the portion sizes, is ridiculous.  The hash was good, but for $13, all I got was a relatively small plate and one measly fried egg. The Chai was sizeable, but at $4, it should be. The most ridiculous thing I saw was coke/diet coke for $3.50...most restaurants charge around $2.50 and that's a rip-off; $3.50 is highway robbery."}
{"text":"Love the idea and the atmosphere.  The coffee is great, and food is good.  However, a farm to table restaurant should really have more fruits and veggies on the menu.  It is peak local strawberry season, so that would be easy.  There is not a fruit in sight, but a bowl of berries would make a nice addition to a lacking breakfast menu.  frittatas with veggies, pressed juices, something healthier. Too much is served in bread form."}
{"text":"Little Spoon=LIttle Portions  Stopped by for lunch today at 2 pm.  The restaurant was  empty when we arrived.  Thought they would be busier on a Friday afternoon.  I arrived before the rest of my party so I had the server bring me some water.  Asked for a lemon.  At first she almost implied that they didn't have any then said she would have to cut one up or she can bring me some lemon juice.  I was a little taken aback that she was less than willing to accommodate my simple request.  I ordered the pork belly sandwich on brioche.  The pork belly was tasty but very fatty.  the brioche bun was dry and fell apart.  My wife ordered the short rib sandwich,  she thought it was good but the bread just fair.   I was disappointed when the server brought the food and there was not any type of accompaniment with our food.  Perhaps a pasta salad, fries,  anything would have been nice.  I would have paid a little more for a complete meal.  Or we had known we could have ordered a side.    I'm all in favor of the farm to table but they need to put a little more thought to their menu planning.  Perhaps it should be farm to school (to learn how to plan a restaurant) to table.  Needless to say everyone with me left hungry."}
{"text":"Newly opened on Selwyn, this little place is a great spot for breakfast with the girls. A little pricey but worth the quality. I love sitting outside along the sidewalk.   I had the BLT when I was in last. And it was worth the $18. The slabs of bacon where thicker than a match book.   They also have table side paying devices (makes me feel like I'm in Europe!).   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic. We always enjoy our servers.  The food is delicious- my wife always orders porridge, which she loves, but I've tried everything and it was great.  I love the atmosphere - very California, including the rap music. We often find ourselves singing along.  Only complaint is the chairs - they are just like my elementary school cafeteria chairs."}
{"text":"Great food, nice service and diverse menu, but menu pricing is high.  The portions are small, no bread service, and the none of the breakfast/lunch sandwiches come with sides. An item such as cinnamon toast costs half as much as sandwiches but the portion is over twice as large.  I understand ingredient pricing varies and drives up the cost, but the difference is disparaging.  I like the food, but Little Spoon is trying to be too clever, too clever that on our first visit their computer system was down and they were unable to even take orders with pen and paper...so we weren't served.  I think Little Spoon has great potential with some tweaks on menu pricing, portions, and table service.  (I am not sure if Little Spoon prides their ingredients on local sourcing, if  they do, it is not apparent from the menu)"}
{"text":"This place invested much in the atmosphere for sure but not so much in their chef selection. Would have been much happier if I did the cooking."}
{"text":"Won't take reservations.  Open only at limited times.  Music played in restaurant is vulgar and not suitable for kids.  Happy to take my business elsewhere to MayoBird or Good Food."}
{"text":"Absolutely rudest experience I've ever had in a restaurant. I ordered an orange juice and when it came out there was thick lipstick on the glass. No big deal, I understand things happen. The waiter took it into the kitchen and then went to the bar. I watched the her pick up the jug and realize there wasn't enough to fill the cup. The bar tender proceed to put water in the glass and pour the orange juice in with the water. Ok, not cool. When they realized that still didn't fill the glass she proceeded to drink it. Ugh. The server returned to our table, never looked directly at me and told the table that was the end of the orange juice and asked if we were ready to order our meal. She never asked me if I'd like something else to drink or apologize. Absolutely the rudest experience I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our second visit here for Sunday brunch. The food is unique and good. We sat outside--it was brisk with traffic noise. The quinoa bowl was great and so was the LS Chai Latte. We'll be back to try lunch and drinks on a weekday."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and won't go back. Food: it's hard to tell from the menu just what you're getting.  Ambience: they didn't use a single sound absorbing material in this place. Add the loud hip-hop music and it's hard to have a conversation.  Parking: awful, but that's not really their fault. Repairs to a collapsing parking deck have been going on for over a year.  Cost:  expensive: $31 for an oatmeal dish and so called liver mush and egg which had no bread with it.  Service: inattentive Also: the servers wear tee shirts saying \"buy me brunch\" with a large image of a pistol. Not a funny joke in 2015 America."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place but was disappointed.  Our lite lunch was much higher than dinner last night.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Okay so you serve a sixteen dollar hamburger and think your cool. No sides at all. You have a sixteen dollar BLT with tasteless barely cooked pork belly. No mayo? No taste and no sides. Then the waitress never ever shows. Uncool."}
{"text":"Little Spoon is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!   The menu changes often, and they always use fresh or organic food items. If you are an adventurous eater, this is the place to go!   The staff is friendly and laid back, as is the atmosphere (you'll hear a wide variety of music, ranging from Lil Wayne to Biggie Small to Top 40's hits, and depending upon your tastes, this could be perceived as a positive or negative contrast to the upscale Myers Park location.) The noise level also becomes loud once the restaurant is full, when you consider the small, but airy space and the music.  Exotic items which I've eaten here include Shredded Lamb Taco, Fish Cheeks, Smores Cookie, Grilled Peach Dessert, Bass Taco, Flounder Taco, Chicken and Waffles, Pork Loin, Corn Puppies, Moon Pie Dessert, Fried Yucca, Ceviche, Guacamole, and Bison Meatballs.   I don't always absolutely love everything that I eat here, but I do always love the variety and creativity in the dishes!   They always serve specialty or gourmet ingredients which I am unfamiliar with in the dishes, which is where the adventurous eating part comes in!  They also have a few select drinks specials, but I have not tried any of the cocktails.  Finding the parking lot can be a bit confusing, but once you do, there is generally an attendant who will direct you."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and have not had a chance to go during the week.  I was impressed with the charm and the menu, but the portions were a bit small.  This is a great place for a girls meal, but I find that men prefer larger portion sizes.  I would like to go back again now that the season has changed to check out the new menu."}
{"text":"Coffee served in a wide bowl with no handle? Everyone knows this loses heat immediately due to the large surface area open to the air. This means cold coffee...and I have big paws and I can barely hold the bowl of coffee in one hand. Of course its also slick and shiny. Two handed coffe drinking?  No.  The bottom of the bowl is of course too hot to hold....unlike my coffee.  So after we were finished the waitress asks would you like a to-go cup for your coffee? Sure. Then I stared fearfully at this bowl of coffee and my to go cup and sized up how exactly I was going to make this transfer."}
{"text":"My vegetarian/vegan friends and I were very disappointed in the lack of options here. You would think as a \"farm to table\" restaurant there would be more here for us! All I could eat was the granola and it wasn't bad... But was definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe at an amazing location. I love that I can walk here easily from my house. Food was delicious and the pop tart was awesome! My only complaint is that the coffee cups do not have handles, I felt like a dog trying to drink out of a water bowl. Not sure why they make you drink your coffee out of a soup bowl?! Food is great, service is superb, but I'll bring my own mug next time."}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate lunch here while in Charlotte. Poor wine list and unhelpful server who brought wrong lunch to me even though there were very few customers. After a wait, he brought my order, Jerk chicken with slaw. Two bites of this flavorless shredded gray meat and I was done. Both bites had sizable pieces of cartilage in them and were disgusting. What a disappointing experience. I will never return and wonder at any of the good reviews."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here last week. Had the egg, cheese and sausage sandwich. Very good. My friend had the special, chicken salad on some sort of bread. Salad was also very good, but the bread was too crumbly, making the sandwich hard to eat.  The restaurant has nice ambiance. Parking can be a bit of a challenge. Seems like they have been working on that parking deck for years.  The service was meh. Our waitress seemed to have an attitude problem. This was our first time in , so we asked a few questions. After we placed our order, my friend leans in to say, \"I think she thinks they are doing us a favor by letting us eat here.\"  The other issue was the music. Way too loud for a conversation. We asked it to be turned down a notch, but were told, \"The manager won't let us.\" More likely, the staff likes it that way. If you want to have a nice conversation, eat outside or go elsewhare.  Probably give this place another shot, if I'm in the area, but hey, Reids is right across the street and has great sandwiches."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with a friend, and while the food was good, I felt it was overpriced for what was served. I ordered the grilled peach parfait (grilled peaches, cornbread and honey whip cream). The peaches were a little on the unripe side and it was derived in a mason jar. While cute presentation wise, it made for difficult eating. The \"bacon\" was more along the style of a piece of pork chop rather than actual bacon in my opinion. I would like to return to try the regular menu, but likely sit outside away to get a break from the overly hipster atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere!  The food was good as well.  A little more expensive than I expected, but was a fun location for brunch with my girlfriends.  I really prefer their outside seating."}
{"text":"Good service and good atmosphere in general. Food was good too, nothing extremely special. I think it was extremely overpriced for quality and quantity. Will not go again because of pricing."}
{"text":"Long story short: Much needed good Saturday morning brunch spot for this area. Wait staff very efficient and helpful. The food well above normal."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a quick afternoon bite and enjoyed sitting outside. I got the Hash and it was delicious! It came with purple and sweet potatoes, peppers, onions, sausage and one on top. Coffee was super yum! The Little Spoon is a cute farm to table restaurant. Dishes are smaller portions for average dollar. So, if you are starrrrving and you are looking for something to fill you up for average cost, this isn't your place. I enjoyed the music playing and that we could pay quickly with our server (you know technology these days, he had a swiper thing). I looked forward to coming back and trying a few more things!"}
{"text":"Leave the kids. Take your wallet. It's farm to table, but expensive. Nice place for hipsters, but not so much for families."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were looking for a brunch spot for us and another couple and decided on Little Spoon.  We used to live nearby and frequented this location when it was Fabo and have wanted to check the 'new' place out.  I'll detail our experience with the following pros/cons list:  Pros: - Ideal location: right off of Selwyn in the heart of Myers Park - Did not experience a wait, were seated right away - The place was very nicely decorated and had an inviting ambiance about it - While not a typical brunch food item the Korean wings were delicious - The coffee was pretty tasty  Cons: - Poor, inattentive service: waitress was very terse, never asked us how our food was, and didn't keep my coffee warm.  Also, we were asked specifically if we would like some of food items to come out first to which we obliged, however they came after our main dish was served. - The rest of the food was disappointing: the minimalist menu didn't do them any favors as what came out was not what we expected (i.e. all of the egg dishes were cooked with a runny yoke, the granola wasn't what you would traditional think of as granola, and the hash seemed cooked and thrown together as opposed to all cooked together in the same skillet). - I had no idea that the 'out of place' rap lyrics on their website translated to playing hardcore wrap in their restaurant for Sunday brunch.. very strange and didn't fit the vibe at all - Payment comes in the awkward form of using an iPad that the waitress hands you while she stands behind your shoulder (including when entering the tip).  I'm an advocate for technology but this leads to poor service etiquette and an uncomfortable situation.  To top it off the receipt was incorrect as I was charged for an extra dish.  Based on the disparity of cons to pros written above it's safe to state that this experience was a disappointment.  I would like to say that I'd be willing to give it another shot but this single visit was convincing enough to go elsewhere for brunch and otherwise."}
{"text":"This is an extremely overrated brunch location. My friends and I were disappointed after seeing so many great reviews. Almost all of the food was lacking in any sort of seasoning and unimpressive. They may also produce the worst, most flavorless biscuits known to the south."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Food was fabulous. Our server was nice but service in general was slow. Got our appetizer before our drinks. I will definitely go back due to the food being great and look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We went for Sunday brunch and got in very quickly. I had toast with goat cheese, egg whites, and salsa verde. It was heavenly! It was also pretty filling considering it was just toast. I highly recommend this cute restaurant!"}
{"text":"Menu:  Great offerings based on seasonal & local produce and good (etc. fennel, grits, thick slices bacon).    Taste:  I can only vouch for the \"Grits\" menu item.  It had braised rabbit, but the rabbit was the texture of 10-min boiled chicken with no flavor, instead of 45-min plus \"braised\" rabbit meat; therefore, it was not tender.  The only flavor you get was from the tomato purée that was poured on top of this dish.   The actual grits were undercooked - al denté grits??   Drinks:  Mimosa- On Point!"}
{"text":"Brunch done right! 90s Hip Hop and RnB is the perfect soundtrack to this cute corner spot.The place was packed on a Sunday morning but they do have outdoor seating as well. My friends and I only had to wait about 15 minutes. Our server Monica gave us great recommendations and conversation. Now let's break down the must-haves:  1. Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (they also have orange) - it was so good, I got some to go. No pulp for those that care.  2. Korean brussel sprouts - I love anything with go chu jang sauce but these had the perfect amount of crisp and kick.  3. BLT - I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of pork belly but this is what's used on the BLT. They were able to make it extra crispy and I was surprisingly impressed.   They get extra points for supporting local small businesses for many of their menu items. My only regret is waiting this long to try it!"}
{"text":"I went in to check this place out when it had just opened. The music made absolutely no sense with the atmosphere. They were playing hip hop music with cuss words in the songs. (Unprofessional). The meatball was pretty good. Oh but did I mention they have no ketchup? It's a breakfast and brunch lunch whatever kind of restaurant and don't have ketchup?"}
{"text":"Disappointed.....one good was our server.  But the food was blah.  Biscuits were dry and fell apart.  Coffee was okay.  I was hoping to have a great breakfast and it was just mediocre.  We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and get a great breakfast. I come to Charlotte on business and I always make sure I do breakfast at least once during my stay. Service is always friendly and the coffee is always strong and hot. Can't get a better \"farm to table\" breakfast in Charlotte! Some of my favorites: Porridge, steel cut oats, quinoa, coconut milk, apples and brown sugar for when I am feeling healthy  Jalapeño egg white brioche with kale and tomato jam for when I am not.  A red eye coffee is my favorite coffee. Strong hot and in an enormous mug."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast 2 days in a row while in charlotte. The food was amazing and so was the service."}
{"text":"Very bland. We had a few lunch dishes so I tried a variety of offerings and we were all unimpressed. Literally, nothing stood out. Poor service. The menu changes daily so I didn't think to ask about specials and the server didn't mention anything. It wasn't until I saw \"off menu\" items being delivered to other tables that I realized and asked...after I'd already ordered. Server THEN told me about the specials and seemed annoyed to do so.   Wouldn't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Last Saturday I ate brunch here with some of my girlfriends... we were seated VERY quickly upon arrival, and the service was perfect!!  We ordered pitchers of mimosas (yes, pitchers) light on the OJ... they were so good we had to order a little extra OJ to go with them! (read: perfect \"mimosas\")...  All of us except one had the chicken biscuits... these and the mimosas made for a perfect brunch... the brussels sprouts were delicious as well!  I love the atmosphere, I love the place, I love the location, and the food and service were tops!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A group I belong to decided to have a brunch business meeting here. I was in charge of scheduling the reservation.  Prior to the meeting, I called the business several times to make a reservation. Each time, I got a voicemail message and left a message. I received no call back. When I finally got a live person, Savannah, she suggested making the reservation by email. My email was never responded to. Eventually, my colleague was able to get through to a live person and schedule a reservation. To me, it seemed that the business did not care about making money, as we were a fairly large group.   Once we arrived, since we were a fairly large group, they sat us outside in the blazing hot sun. I was so hot and my phone literally overheated. Also, the mood music was very loud and I could not hear my colleagues. I felt like Rihanna and Drake were in attendance at our meeting. So, maybe we did not pick the most appropriate place to hold a business meeting. Not necessarily holding that against Little Spoon.  The food was terrible. Little Spoon is trying too hard to be trendy and their food is overpriced, a la carte, and not good. First, I ordered a soft shell crab sandwich. It looked like a dead crab on a bun. It was fishy, sour and inedible. I sent it back and requested something else. I should note that I am not the most picky of people when it comes to food. I instead ordered a dish that was purple potatoes chopped up on a plate. Overpriced and not good either. It was dry and tasted burnt. I ended up not eating much at that meal.  When the bills came, we did not receive itemized receipts. Instead, in the name of being green, the waitress walked around with an iPad. When I got my receipt via email, I realized I paid for someone else's food and was overcharged. I called and asked for a credit. The manager explained, she would credit my credit card.   If I can avoid it, I will not be back.  Edit: after waiting awhile and not seeing a credit on my credit card, I emailed Little Spoon again. They sent me a copy of the receipt showing the credit to my card...except that it was not my card. Somebody must have been happy for the gift. Eventually, I did get my refund, but it was a lengthy process."}
{"text":"This is a very special place. Be ready when you get here. Food is so good. Atmosphere is very upbeat."}
{"text":"As a brunch lover, I really wanted to like Little Spoon. Many herald it as the best brunch in the city, so I was very excited to try it. We went on Father's Day around 9AM and were able to be seated immediately, but after 10 or so there's likely to be a wait.   It was sort of doomed from the start when I looked at the menu. I love an innovative brunch but this was too far out there for me. I got the vegetable hash which had good flavor but just wasn't my style; it felt more like a lunch item. We shared the donut holes which were fresh & good but relatively straightforward.   I dunno. Being instructed on \"how\" to use the menu just doesn't seem fitting for brunch. I think this spot just isn't my style. However, I can see why people are intrigued, so if this sounds more appealing to you, by all means go for it!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Chicago, DC, Houston, Philly & Atlanta. I've traveled to just about every major city in the country. I'm no stranger to good food. Unfortunately, the Charlotte food scene leaves much to desired. This place is a shinny gem in a sea of....ah...well...you get the point. What's more, the staff genuinely cares about patrons. I felt the love.  Oh yeah the food. It's good. Solid. 5 stars for Charlotte. I will come back and recommend this places to all my friends. Definitely grab the deviled eggs!"}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch experience. The menu is just varied enough to cover the things you could want during brunch.   They have specials and are usually really good. The burger I had was delicious. The quality of food is really good as well, they have organic options and the burger i had was from a cow just down the road, grass fed and locally ground beef.   The customer service was great, the waiting staff was really responsive and the music and decor of the place was on point.  Highly recommended you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking forward to the experience of dining at this restaurant for months. Too bad the service was disappointing and we ended up leaving. We frequent brunch spots often and the fact that they couldn't even offer us a drink the full 10 minutes we were there and the restaurant was half full is very disconcerting. In addition, the menu is not easy to ready and the food did not match the theme. This is a no go for us!  We promptly left and went to our favorite spot."}
{"text":"Okay breakfast food, nice patio, service and good coffee. I have wanted to try this place for awhile but the food is only average. I think it has a cool vibe with hip hop music and nice outdoor tables. For the price point I think there are lots of options with more original breakfast food. That said their coffee is good and the egg, bacon, sandwich was alright. I think I was expecting more original recipes."}
{"text":"Pretentiousness four plus from the female waitresses. Manager overly nice. Super odd food and taste. The food is simple ingredients, poshed up for a steep price tag. Turkey sandwich $15 with only lettuce and tomato. No cheese. Very very basic.  Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but a rough experience with them this past weekend sort of kills my pro-Little Spoon mentality.  They inexplicably kicked my party off the waitlist while we were waiting, had no answer for what happened when we asked them about it, put us back on the waitlist in some arbitrary spot bearing no relation to where we initially were, and then proceeded to quote a new wait time that doubled the original estimate.   Little Spoon, your hostess messed up. These things happen, but she didn't have a fix for it, and it wasted my family's time. We've had many good meals here (the bacon...), but unfortunately their bacon isn't enough to save them, and we won't be back. Perhaps this level of service is why their sister restaurant Comida crashed and burned..."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last year and was not impressed. Tried it again recently and was very disappointed. I ordered the short rib sandwich and had to send it back. It was NOT short ribs but it was tasteless sliced roast beef.  The bread was thick and hard and basically inedible.  There was one waitress to handle everyone and understandably it made for slow service.  The music was loud and didn't really fit the place.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait for this restaurant to open! We live just down the street and just knew it would be a new favorite. Not so, unfortunately. The menu is very limited, maybe 5 choices of entrees. Many of them have some heat and I don't like hot/spicy food, so I struggle to find something to eat. Small portions, big prices. Nice, funky decor; a nice outdoor area to eat; and a great neighborhood for shopping, art galleries, a frozen yogurt store. It's a great urban experience. If it just wasn't for the food!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The coffee was delicious and I was impressed with all of the local offerings, however the menu is limited. Not a lot of gluten free items. Cute space, but parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"You have to try the bacon. You have to try the burger. You have to try the hash. It's all so good and refreshing to see a place like this in Charlotte with such a contemporary vibe. We had a phenomenal New Year's Day breakfast and the service was fantastic. Thanks, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Right when they first opened I wrote a review talking about how great the food and service were, but then picked apart a couple of the other shortcomings.  I decided to delete that one and wait for them to iron out the kinks and then give them another shot.  As a farm to table place, I've got to respect what they are doing.  I'm glad I came back.  I went in for brunch today and the place just seemed to have a more personable feel.  I was greeted instantly by a smiling hostess.  I really like the idea of the countdown board at the hostess stand.  They have a certain number of burgers and a certain number of pop tarts per day, if you snooze, you lose.  But, at least they let you know where you're at.  Anyhow, after being promptly seated, my attentive server Sherydan asked if I wanted sparkling or still water, not something you get asked very often in the states.  As I assume pretty much anyone else that grew up in the south would do, I went with the still.  Also, I got me a coffee.  I had read other review where people commented on the coffee cup not having a handle, so I wasn't surprised at that.  I honestly didn't mind it, the mug was thick enough where it wasn't too hot to hold.  I will say it would have been cool if they had almond milk as well as the coconut milk, but that's just me.   After giving me a few minutes to decide, my server came back to ask what I wanted to order.  I would have loved to have ordered the cassoulet, but it just seemed to heavy from that early in the morning so after much thought I finally decided on the shashuska.  If a breakfast place takes the time to bake eggs in a sauce, I'm going to try it.  I'm glad the food didn't take too awful long because I was quite hungry and the smells in this place were just making it worse.  My eggs were cooked just right and the toast soaked it up perfectly.  The pomodoro sauce came out great as well.  I didn't really get a lot of the flavor from the fennel, and parsnips aren't necessarily my favorite, but all in all it was a great dish.  At only a couple bucks more than a small breakfast sandwich, brunch seems like a great deal.  After my meal my lovely server asked me if I wanted some coffee to go, but I declined, those huge cups(bowls) were plenty.  I did take a little bit of leftovers to go, I know that pomodoro sauce would mix in well with the vodka sauce I made last night.  I quickly was handed my ipad to cash out on and on to the rest of my day I went.  I don't live in the area, so I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon.  That said, I'm glad to see this place has made some changes for the better, and love what they are doing style wise.  Even the music was more tolerable this time, although sappy 80's love songs wasn't exactly what I was looking for on this specific day."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. First off, MONICA is a badass server. So friendly, funny/sarcastic and just an all-around great person.   Now, the food. Whoa! The BTF potatoes are insane and the cinnamon brûlée toast was NOM! Bacon is thick cut and cured in-house; delish, but you may want to ask for it well done.   Iced coffee was some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Little Spoon?! What?!  Man oh man, do I love brunch or what?! First, let's talk about how freaking adorable this restaurant is and where it's located. For anyone who lives near the area, apparently this area is known for \"old money\" rich people. So, the demographic of this area is very high maintenance and very very very classy. But, that didn't stop me and my family from getting our brunch fix! Usually, this place is known to become busy and the wait would be about 45 mins to an hour. Luckily for me, we only had to wait 20 minutes and was then seated and greeted by one of their lovely servers.   As soon as we sat down, we were immediately served iced water and was left with a big glass of water for the table to share (smart idea)! The waiter was extremely attentive and helpful when it came to explaining their featured specials and as well as the menu itself. The atmosphere reminded me of a night club but is converted into a restaurant during the day. My table started off with their \"snacks\" called DoNuts. Their \"DoNuts\" was covered in glazed and sat on top of creme anglaise and chocolate ganache. It usually comes with only three donuts but because my table had four people, the waitress added an extra donut without any extra cost. Talk about southern hospitality?! The donuts were to die for, they melted right in my mouth and wasn't too sweet. It was the perfect snack right before my main entree came out from the kitchen.   As I was waiting for my food, I noticed how much kimchi they had on their menu! Apparently they love their pork belly and kimchi! When my table's food came out, everything just looked so savory and delicious. As confirmed, everyone enjoyed their entree and was full by the time we had left. If there is one negative thing I could say about my dish was that it was just too oily for me (but hey, I still ate it and it was amazing)."}
{"text":"Showed up at 1:45 on a Sunday (they close at 3pm) and was turned away by the hostess with a poorly explained \"we're not seating any more for the rest of the day\" -- something to the effect of them taking a lot of reservations and being unable to accommodate walk-ins. The restaurant was half-empty. I guess their spoons are even smaller than they advertise."}
{"text":"Unique little spot. Cool atmosphere. Very short menu, limited options. Server indicated this is due to its \"farm to table\" nature, and depends on availability of fresh ingredients. At any rate, seems they are a little late to the \"farm to table\" game. That said, the food was good. Cinnamon toast is great, cool brunch item or almost a dessert. The bacon is thick and hearty. Shrimp on a roll was tasty. Wings were 'okay' - a potent taste and smell and not as fresh as some other items. Definitely worth a stop - very quaint place to catch some nibbles."}
{"text":"Decided to try little spoon for breakfast today and it was a great choice. my wife and I had the BTF, SLAB BACON AND CHICKEN BISCUITS! Everything was delicious! the garlic aioli is wonderful & the OJ is fresh squeezed. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Little Spoon is a really nice spot for brunch. My lady, a friend and I stopped here this morning and I'm so happy we picked it! The restaurant is full of grainy wood, red brick, cast iron and Edison styled light bulbs. I know this style isn't for everyone but it's everything I love in one restaurant. The bonus and nail in the coffin for the Brooklyn hipster vibe is the Outkast Pandora station that keeps the ambiance up beat!  The staff are numerous, attentive and friendly. They have ipads instead of order books so the orders go right in and paying the bill is about 5-10 minutes faster. The coffee is delicious and comes in a bowl which means you won't burn your tongue - too hot for hands means it's too hot for your mouth.  The menu is small, but mighty, for brunch and the specials make you think twice. I got the cheerwine brined chicken biscuits after changing my mind over, and over, and again after hearing the specials and again one last time. The food did not disappoint - it was delicious.  Some reviews point out that it's too pricey for what you get; $10-$20 is expensive for brunch and here you won't get the usual southern helpings. This price for real, prepared by hand food isn't all that bad. This is obviously not freshly thawed food from Sysco or otherwise and to me, I think, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Brunching it with the Hubby. Hubby did a search on Top Brunch Spots and Little Spoon came up. Upon arrival we were seated immediately. We got here about 11:45. The inside had nice exposed brick and a semi open kitchen.  We started off with the Bacon! OMG, delicious doesn't say enough for this bacon. It's more of a pork belly slab. Absolutely loved it, 3 decent sized pieces.   For entrees, I selected the Chicken biscuit. It turned out to be 2 full sized biscuits stuffed with delicious fried chicken that appeared to have some type of brine or marinade to pull out the taste. This was really enough for 2 people to share. Hubby had the Sec- chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and white cheddar, it was very favorable. The bread was a bit heavy. We also tried the deconstructed potatoes. They were hot and crispy.  Overall good experience. About $40 for all the items above. Also keep in mind the items are all tapas style and don't have accompanying sides, so be sure to plan ahead."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Charlotte. My favorite dishes are the Korean Brussels and the Hash. I've been a few times, and the quality is consistent. Nice, friendly service. Also, you can order coffee first if you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with Little Spoon, overall. While there are many things I liked and appreciate (I'll describe in review), I didn't think it lived up to the hype I've heard. Maybe I need to go in for a weekday breakfast or lunch.  We went around 11 am on a Sunday, prime time for brunch, which I realize. I don't mind waiting and we expected to have to wait. Luckily, the wait was quicker than we were quoted (45 minutes), and they have an awesome little app system that tells you how long you've waited and how much longer you have. That was an A+ touch!  We bought coffees from the coffee bar during our wait. $3.50 for a regular coffee is insane and priced much too high. This was the first thing I saw as off.  Once we were seated, we checked out the menu's and put an order in for the cinnamon toast brulee. However, that app didn't end up coming out until AFTER our food, which was a bummer because by that time, some of my appetite was gone and I was looking forward to trying this dish before. I had the shashuska, which was just ok. I tasted alot of spice, but ultimately, I think it still lacked flavor. They do give you ample bread for dipping in the tomato sauce, which I did appreciate. My husband had the SEC with chicken sausage, which is actually very small in size and you don't get a side with it.  The service was mediocre. We actually had to go up and refill our water a few times, and the waitor didn't ask if we wanted refills on our coffee (cold and empty at this point) until after we received our bill and were ready to go.  Not sure I would return here."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the food or the waitress. We ordered a chai tea latte and it taste like toilet water. The waitress told us when we asked her about  the flavor that is was not made the same as other chai's and was also unsweetened. Something that would have been helpful prior to ordering since I asked her how it taste before I ordered it. Didn't check on our table until we flagged her down for checks. Then she charged my card twice, didn't say anything. I checked my bank account to find out because I saw her swipe my card twice and didn't feel good about it. She assured me that one will void from my card but I'm not convinced. Especially since I had to go back and ask her why I was charged twice instead of her telling me up front something went wrong. I would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE. They have a very small menu, no sides, food not prepared well and service sucks. Just save yourself the headache and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cheers to checking another bookmark off my list!   Walking in I instantly realized that I was going to like this place. Everyone was smiling, everyone greeted me and they were blasting classic hip hop....and it was only noon. Now that's what you call a welcome!   For starters we ordered the Root Vegetable Pappardelle which were a mix of crispy parsnips and crispy carrots. Ahhhmazing. They had so much flavor! I really enjoyed munching on these to start the meal.   After a quick chat with the waitress and asking for her recommendations, I ordered the Short Rib with and my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken.   Man....that Short Rib sandwich was delicious. The baguette was crispy, the short rib was so tender and goat cheese spread just put it over the top. I loved every....single...bite. I might need to amend my last meal on earth and add this to my list....sorry mom. My friend let me try her Jerk Chicken and it was tender and packed just the right amount of spiciness. And I love how  they let you opt for the lettuce cups instead of the baguette. My friend raved about them so I know she's a fan, just like I am!   I'm looking forward to heading back on a Thursday night to sample their dinner menu......   Great job Little Spoon, you have a new fan!"}
{"text":"This was our second time having Sunday brunch at this restaurant. First time around I loved their cappuccinos and the overall experience left us wanting to explore more things on the menu.  Coming in, we were told that there will be a 30 minute wait. It turned out to be an hour and ten minute wait, and two parties waiting in line before us left. Ordered chicken biscuits as an appetizer, they were dry, and the chicken to biscuit ratio is definitely off. Also had Korean Brussels, which were decent. As an entree, I ordered the sticky rice. It was underwhelming. Pulled pork on top was lacking flavor - my 9 months old enjoyed it though, no wonder - it tastes more like baby food. And the kicker - my husband ordered a burger, and on his last bite he found a hair in it. The whole meal was ruined. I genuinely feel like this is basic sanitary issue, and if you're made to wait over an hour for food, it should at least be prepared in a clean environment. This was the last time we went here. Have to give them credit for taking off the burger and our drinks off the bill, but it doesn't even begin to make up for a ruined Sunday morning."}
{"text":"My spouse and I went here for breakfast this morning. We've gone to several great places for breakfast in the city; Flying Biscuit Cafe, Terrace Cafe, and 300 East to name a few. I would say I was a bit underwhelmed with the little spoon.   We were seated immediately upon arriving at 9. Our waitress was very friendly and the restaurant is eclectic and modern. The menu is relatively small, but offers a good variety of breakfast dishes; ranging from appetizer like foods, to dishes you can eat by hand or \"spork.\"  We decided on the chicken and biscuits and chicken sausage sandwhich; both of which have an interesting name on the menu. We also got the donut bites (also a unique name on the menu). There were 3 donut bites for around 5 dollars. Although delicious, hardly worth the price for such a small amount. I will say both dishes, although again small, were delicious and worth the price.   Overall, little spoon lives up to its name, but should consider somewhat larger dishes if they continue to keep their prices on the \"big spoon\" side."}
{"text":"I am always excited when new places open up in the QC, as there is always a possibility for them to be great. I had a rare chance for a weekday lunch date and it just worked out for the wife to join me on this day. Little Spoon has not been open for long and I really only became aware of it from the most recent QC exclusive magazine.  Little Spoon is tucked away in the same building as Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn. It was a little bit of a challenge to find the entrance, but from now on I know exactly where to go. I was waiting for the wife to meet me, and I was starving so I ordered the heirloom tomato salad. Now the menu, as others have mentioned, is tiny with only 2 salad options and 3 sandwiched on this day. There were also a few side options and drinks to include a full coffee menu.   The heirloom tomato salad was great with the freshest ingredients possible. It was also plentiful, but I still ordered the lamb pastrami sandwich later when the wife finally arrived. She got the shrimp sandwich and we split a side of couscous. My americano was good, but not great. Service was good and attentive, but overall on the slower side. We definitely did not feel rushed out of there. I sat just opposite the kitchen and could see them working. It looked like every dish was completely made to order, so I can appreciate that it may not be a quick lunch place if you are in a rush. One other slight negative was how cramped the tables were next to each other.   All in all, the food was great in flavor, the small menu was not a problem for us, but the table set up and speed of service were the main issues. It seems like a lot of people are taken aback by the small menu. If everything is good that should not be a problem. I am not sure if the kitchen size is limiting the menu, but that may be their biggest problem long term based on the other reviews on yelp regarding the breakfast and lunch menus. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I really liked this place - small menu but a lot of variety contained within. I got a lamb meatball appetizer and an amazing heirloom tomato salad.  Really delicious, fresh, and memorable. Cool space, nice servers...it's a little pricey for what it is but I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"45 Minute wait on a Sunday around noon, which is average. The service was great, atmosphere was okay. The coffee was good, but served in a soup bowl with no handle. Kind of tricky given the heat bled right through the bowl, but worked out. The apps were DELICIOUS! Korean Brussels sprouts as well as Potatoes (#BTC I think ?). Great choices. The entrees were not at all amazing and for the $12-$15 per entre price, I would recommend just ordering another app. Overall a bit mixed and I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Brunched here with a few friends this past weekend and really enjoyed the experience overall.  The donut appetizer comes with three donuts per order and generous servings of ganache on the side and we all thought they were very good. I had the kale and pork belly served on cornbread (a special) which I thoroughly enjoyed and some friends had the burger special which they also said was delicious.   Our beverages were not the highlight of the meal. The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed, but unfortunately also tasted a little off which I would chalk up to the quality of the produce at this time of year. The two bloody marys at table were spicy/peppery but did not have a full body of flavor to complement the spiciness.   Our waitress was very nice and didn't bat an eye when we asked to pay separately. You can also call ahead to put your name on the wait list which was extremely helpful. We were able to walk in and get seated right away because we called in advance."}
{"text":"Waited a half hour for a table for 4 at brunch so be prepared to wait a bit on Sundays.  But it was worth it for the side of bacon.  Bacon is cut in house and super thick and delicious. Did I mention I love the bacon?!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience from the decor to the James Brown playing. Service was also great. Great crowd even at 2pm on a Saturday. Both my wife and I thought the menu was a little too abstract. The waitress had to explain - this is a salad, this is a sandwich. We both ordered the burger and it was delicious, although a tad pricey at $14 (and no sides). We ordered a side of some fried veggies and we both found those entirely too salty...couldn't finish the bag. I think they have the makings for a great little restaurant with some menu and price refinements. The other down side is that we left feeling greasy...not sure if it was the fried veggies or the burger. I look forward to trying more menu options and increasing my rating to a 4.   Two months later...I did return with my parents for breakfast and sadly, we won't be back. The food just isn't hitting the spot and it's entirely over priced. Portion sizes are ridiculously small, bacon is too thick, cinnamon toast was peppered with coarse sugar, coffee bowls are lame...Change the menu and prices and we'll back. We used to go to Fabu on the regular but we can't swing your Manhattan prices."}
{"text":"LOVE the new menu! We had a great waitress and our meal was amazing, drinks were our favorite in a long while! Only suggestion would be maybe get the hostess in the loop, bless her heart she didn't know what was going on and we didn't love the on the spot bill pay with the iPad at the end of the meal, probably gonna Hurt tips for their team being put on the spot like that. Luckily our waitress built rapport with us through the meal so it wasn't so awkward but I could see  that being a bad note to leave the experience on."}
{"text":"We ordered the wings as an appetizer and the farro salad and the burger that was on special for our main meal. They brought the salad and burger before the wings and had to figure out what happened to the wings. They brought them out after we finished our meal. They were pretty terrible. Hot and flavorless with what seemed to be oil drizzled around them on the plate. Not sure what that was for. The farro salad had a couple chopped up tomatoes, barely any arugula, one tiny slice of cucumber and it didn't even fill the tiny plate. The burger wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. The water they served in a chilled decanter tasted like tap water. We wanted to tell them our issues with the food to give them a helpful and honest review but they never asked how our food or anything was. So we kept it to ourselves and decided to just not go back. Bad atmosphere, overpriced, lousy food, no apologies for messing up our order. Real bummer."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. I asked the waitress if she had a recommendation and what would be a good amount of food. She said she did not. I ordered the  quinoa bowl and it was literally just flavorless dried out quinoa with about a teaspoon of chopped up celery and tiny poached egg on top. Nothing else. I left unsatisfied and hungry and went home to make some eggs. I feel like the atmosphere has potential but food takes a long time to come out and the menu is disappointing"}
{"text":"This place is more than meets the eyes. Don't underestimate the portions because the food is definetly FILLING and really aesthetically pleasing. The Porchetta was incredibly filling and had a really great savory flavor profile. The sticky rice was also out of this world and had a perfect balance of savory to sweet ratio which I'm really picky about. The price was more than fair for how full you leave."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Everything was so salty. Over priced. I really wanted to like this place. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Little Spoon but was unfortunately let down during my visit. I got the chilaquiles as a starter hoping for something really cool, but really what it came out as was tortillas in a sauce, that's it. No beans, no tomatoes, not even some chives really. The flavor profile was good on the sauce don't get me wrong, but for $11, I had hoped for more than tortilla chips in sauce. As for the main course I opted for the omelette, and sadly it was quite plain as well. I could have made a better one at home for less. It was just, plain, with not much flavor to go with at at all. Overall I was unfortunately let down by the brunch here."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome! My husband and I came on a busy Sunday. Service was great, especially considering how packed the restaurant was. Food was wonderful. Drinks were full of booze. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Although The Little Spoon has great coffee, my walking group won't be going back here anymore.  Wait staff wear tee shirts with large, graphic handguns and the words \"Buy me breakfast.\"  I find this imagery inappropriate for the neighborhood and especially insensitive for Charlotte at this time.   Not cute at all."}
{"text":"Cute place. Menu is limited and the food is overpriced. Not impressed with my chicken sandwich. The bartender was our server and she was very good. However, due to the small portions, lackluster food, prices, and limited options, I was less than impressed."}
{"text":"My thoughts on the restaurant are in line with others who have commented previously.  The interior of the restaurant is quite nice.  The wait staff were also very good.  But that said, the food is a bit pricey for what you get.  And my dish was not very memorable in quality.  I got a Caesar Salad, which the server said was an entree-sized portion.  She also proceeded to alert me to the fact that there were anchovies in the salad.  The salad consisted of a nice-sized piece of lettuce, some slivers of cheese and dressing on the side...that's it!  No croutons and no anchovies to be found.  I trust that they were in the dressing, but, if so, they sure did not pack a wallop.  While the dressing itself was OK, it was in no way memorable.  For $9, I felt a bit underwhelmed.  The only saving grace was to go a few doors down in the shopping center and have two pieces of to-die-for chocolate truffles in the wine and chocolate shop."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars. The service was pretty good, the morning drinks were delicious, but our food was meh. I think we maybe ordered wrong, but that still lays claim to meh food for us.  I ordered the blt... which wasn't really a blt. It was more like a pork sandwich with lettuce and tomato. If I'd known, I would have ordered something else because I'm not really into large chunks of pork. Just a preference thing. The chicken and biscuits were pretty good. But the dryness of the biscuits took over the amazingness of the chicken. The chicken was spectacular though!  The deviled eggs were pretty good and I liked the 8 minute cookies (some of my party didn't). My hot chocolate was insanely delicious and kept me super warm on a cold day - love that you can spike all your drinks.  Overall, not sure it was worth the price we paid, but I'm still glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance, with the 90s rap and giant bowls of coffee.  It was a tough decision but I ordered the BEC - which was good, however the slab bacon just wasn't up my alley.  I love bacon, thick bacon too - and this was just too much like pork belly to have tons of bacon-y flavor and goodness."}
{"text":"We were not impressed at all with the food or the prices! We love brunch, and this is definitely not a place we would recommend. Starting with the menu, which was like a tiny blank piece of paper. Secondly they had run out of a lot of dishes an it was just noon..  We both had a shashukah and it was awful! It was basically a soup of tomato paste with an egg on top. No flavor at all... We both had coffees and we tried the house bacon. Don't expect a crispy bacon, it's just a chunk of pork. It was tasty but definitely not up to our expectations.  We ended up paying almost $60 for a brunch that was not even good.."}
{"text":"LittleSpoon is a charming brunch place in the Selwyn area of Charlotte. We had a business lunch here on a Saturday morning and had to wait an hour for a table (typical wait since weekends are crazy). Food was pretty good as were drinks. We ordered the hot chocolate, chai tea, and sparkling lemonade. Chai Tea was some of the most authentic I've tasted in a while, although as we ended the meal, it did get a bitter taste. Donuts were nothing special but the brussel sprouts, BTF (basically fancy homefries), and bacon were delicious. It's not an \"amazing\" brunch place but definitely a good one and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was really let down by little spoon. While I appreciated the retro hip-hop playing in the background, it was pretty loud and my in-laws didn't really appreciate it.   The (mostly)Good: I had the chicken biscuits, and they were delicious! Just an absolutely home run, but for $12 it wasn't enough food. The server was very nice and attentive.   The not so good: 2 people in our group order the 'Menage' (coddled eggs) and it was flat out gross... and even if it was good... it still was not very much food. The liver mush was about as bland as I've ever tasted. I forgot the name of my wife's dish, but it was essentially just finely diced sweet potato with a poached egg on top... that dish also had absolutely zero flavor and was very small.   Overall: I was hoping this would be a fun experience, but need up embarrassed to have been the one to recommend the place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and sat outside. The server we had was sub-par and the food was just ok but the ultimate issue was the service and lack of concern or apology for the experience we had. we ordered the jalapeño biscuits as an app and after we put the order in the server came our saying they were out...your a breakfast/brunch spot how do you run out of biscuits??? So then we order the bacon app and it was OK...I wouldn't order again. Then where it's really interesting was when we order the main food. I order chicken sandwich and my fiancé orders the mic drop biscuit sandwich. My chicken sandwich was good but to be honest it was not $11 good for just a small chicken sandwich with no side...I rather go to chick fil and get a number one for $6. Then the mic drop my fiancé got was a joke...so tiny and it literally was not edible. It was so chewy he couldn't even chew through it to swallow. When telling the server she was pointless and made us feel stupid for even saying anything. We sent back the sandwich and ordered the chicken sandwich instead and after waiting 25 mins on it decided to ask for the check and leave. The waitress didn't even apologize at all and said the reason for the wait was that they had so many orders. We had to send his first one back therefore his should take priority for your problem! So my fiancé left hungry with not eating anything and we both left confused about the whole situation. We definitely won't be back despite living in the area."}
{"text":"Are they out of business? Sitting in the parking lot with friends 10am on a Tuesday and it's closed....  Some people drove pretty far to get here.    Upon asking around they might be closed for renovations.  It would have been nice to put that on their website"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero O would have. I detest bad customer service. My friends and I came this morning to enjoy our monthly brunch. We were sat but we sat for 10 mins with out even a cup of water. Waiters kept walking by but no one ever served us. No asked if we had been helped or even slowed down long enough for us to ask. We got up and went to Terrence Cafe where I know the service will be great."}
{"text":"Funky, hipster vibe in a great spot on busy Selwyn.  The menu is eclectic which varies often.  However, some things remain the same;  prompt, competent and friendly service; quick, unique and tasty fare (shout out to their bacon--so good); and reasonable prices considering the zip code and quality of ingredients.  I ding them one star only because I'm a breakfast boy, and would prefer greater variety in this space.  What I order, however, has always been spot on and cooked perfectly.  I like Little Spoon."}
{"text":"Great location for brunch! If you're tired of the same type of brunch menu, (pancakes, eggs, or bacon), I would recommend Little Spoon for brunch. Today we tried the Deviled Eggs as an appetizer. This dish was super savory with various textures! This is a must try! If you also want to have a different cocktail than your traditional mimosa, try their Limosa or their Royale (both drinks have Cuvée o Bubbly)"}
{"text":"Stopped by Little Spoon yesterday for brunch before we head to the St. Paddy Pub Crawl! Perfect day for it. The patio was open.. Great 90s and 2000 R&B/Hip music jamming overhead. Puts me in a fabulous mood to get wasted later. Customer service was great. She was on point! Again, those who have read my past reviews. Customer service is very important on my list..  My girls ordered: grits and pork belly bacon, wings, egg white breakfast sandwiches, cronuts and I ordered the shrimp Raft! I like the Shrimp Raft. Very tasty. The bagel I think sits in the middle of the bowl, then it's fills with sauce, shrimp and arugula! Awesome to me! Wings have a kick. Those whose a fan of spicy and a little kick in their food. These are great. I didn't care of it.. I also tried the cronuts. I couldn't understand the hype.. It's definitely fried and believe me, I am a fan of fried food. But I didn't care for these. I think it's greasy. I can taste the grease.. Nothing impressive. Won't order that again. But overall, I would love to come back and try a few more dishes. Nice brunch/lunch hangout that you can get breakfast anytime and with a nice day.. I can almost feel like I'm on vacation... ALMOST!"}
{"text":"Worst brunch in Charlotte I've ever had. Menu options were extremely limited. It's fine if you want to do a la carte, but at least have a side menu to order from. The chicken biscuits were flavorless and almost inedible. Save yourself $12 and get chicken minis that actually have taste. The hash was not impressive either. Our waitress was rude to us and not helpful about menu options. At the end, she brought over an iPad with choices of 18, 20, or 25% gratuity. That was really icing on the cake. I was so excited about Little Spoon because of things I've heard, but I will never be back."}
{"text":"Cool vibe.  Love the decor.  Ala carte menu.  Don't particularly like that it's not open for dinner/drinks but i understand the concept."}
{"text":"Excellent service, DELisIOUS food, great music! Wins across the board. The donuts and bacon slabs - sooo good! The chicken biscuit - also good. All their juice is fresh squeezed. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is ALWAYS outstanding. The food is great and the ambiance is very chic and modern. They serve great coffee too! My wife and I come here with our one-year old and the staff always goes out of their way to help us and they interact with our daughter.  If you have a choice between Little Spoon or Vivace not far from Selwyn, definitely go with Little Spoon. Vivace sucks. Their service is awful."}
{"text":"What a cute tasty place & well worth the wait! My husband got the Sticky Rice bowl & enjoyed it. I got the Chicken & biscuits and it was SO yummy! The homemade aioli sauce is what really made this choice delicious. It's a small cozy place, but very baby friendly as we had our 9 month old with us and all the staff was so sweet to him! He especially loved the cook who kept playing peek a boo with him from behind the counter. Oh! Almost forgot, we also got the French Toast holy yumminess!"}
{"text":"If I could describe the food and ambience of this place in one word, it would be... Odd.   They try way too hard to be unique and miss the most important part of any restaurant: the food has to taste good. Everything I tried was mediocre at best. The only edible part of my shakshuka was the toast that came on the side. The hash was eh; their coffee/mocha was also pretty bad.   Also, to add to other reviewers comments about the music: I enjoy early 2000s music as much as anyone else, but there's only so much 112 and B2K one can listen to back to back."}
{"text":"First time here, and after reading all my fellow Elite reviews, I just had to check it out! Took my GF Michelle there on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, and this is the location where Fabo used to be located. Thankfully an enterprising West Coast transplant created this cool hip-hop LA Vibe-y place called Little Spoon.  Now all this \"vibe\" would be lost IF the food suck. And the food did not suck! In fact, the food and service were AWESOME!   This place looks nothing like Fabo, thankfully. It's definitely got that West Coast vibe to it, and there hip-hop music blaring (OK, I admit to not being a huge hip-hop fan but I agree that it's better than Lawrence Welk....barely)....  Menu is small but packs a wallup! For starters we opted for the Cinnamon Toast Brulee, which basically was a piece of buttery brioche toped with coars sugar and cinnamon, and torched to get great carmelization. This was divine! No syrup required!  Note that this place is basically Tapas style in that sharing is what it's all about. So we ordered the Shashuka, which was a VERY SPICY dish! We were warned, and since we both love spicy, we loved it! Just know that this will light up your taste buds as the sauce contains some hot peppers....YUM! But with that was a savory egg, parsnip and fennel.   We also got the Chicken Biscuit which had super moist and juicy fried chicken, which was heavenly! That garlic aioli was killer! Finally ordered the Jerk Chicken lettuce cups, which had of course pulled jerk chicken and a creamy slaw inside a lettuce wrap. This was as refreshing as it was satisfying.  Our waitress Sherydan was super friendly, efficient and excellent at making recommendations!  Can't wait to come back! A super welcome addition to the already awesome neighborhood!  HIGHLY Recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Little Spoon for breakfast this past Saturday.  It was great service and I love the farm to table concept, and you can tell all of the ingredients are so fresh.  Our food was delicious!  I ordered the Shashuka - I would order it again and again.  My friend ordered the BLT and it was also good, but a smaller portion.  I wish it came with a side or something.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I wish the portions were a little more in line with the prices.  Overall great place and I will be going again!"}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh and tasty. I had the braised rabbit grits (AMAZING!) and my boyfriend had the hash with a side of the thickest cut bacon you have ever laid your eyes on, all from the Freakin Weekend menu. Oh, and the espresso is perfection. I still find myself craving their mocha daily. If you want a warm, welcoming atmosphere with farm to table fresh food then Little Spoon should be your next destination."}
{"text":"Oh LAWDD thank you!  I have been dreaming about this place!  Let's call a spade a spade here yelpers - this place is awesome.    I'm a brunch monster - and spend the majority of my week days agonizing over where I am going to eat brunch on Saturday and Sunday.  Obviously Fenwicks is my Sunday shizzle but my Saturday spot has been open for too long.  A friend and coworker told me about Little Spoon.  All she said was that I would love it - but I had NO IDEA how right she was going to be.  Okay, let's break it down.  Parking kind of sucks - but get over it.  If you are stuffing your face with earth shattering noms, chances are you need to walk a little.  The venue - IS - SO - COOL.  Vintage rustic industrial feel with open air, high ceilings and an exposed kitchen.  Even their plate ware and water pitchers are unique.  The music is not at all what you expect - but so freaking fun!  I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag, you'll have to go and listen for yourself.  Okay let's get to the meat (pun intended) - the food.  The menu is small - which to me says they make a few good things, and they make them well.  It's not your typical omelet and grits kind of place... so don't expect to see the iHop menu.  This is cuisine - and there is a lot that goes into it.  Highlights were the homemade PB&J pop-tart (it's like they know me), the BLT - I would literally bathe in their homemade lemon aioli, the breakfast sandwich, the pork belly bacon, and the coffee.   The cool thing is that because they are farm to plate the menu will change as they get in new and different items.  Prices are going to be a bit higher than your run of the mill breakfast joint... but still very reasonable.  I want to be sure I don't overlook the staff.  The waiters/waitresses are the backbone of this place.  How do they hire so many awesome people?!  I don't get it.  The Chef is always out on the floor making sure that people like their food, and helping out where need be.  And if my memory serves, the restaurant manager is also the same guy who helped to open Maverick Rock Taco on Park Road - and he is excellent.  Overall you can tell that Little Spoon puts their heart and soul into this restaurant and the food.  It's almost like when you step inside you morph into Asheville or Charleston.  Little Spoon is incredible and I hope that Charlotte starts to get more places like this - preferably closer to uptown.... but this is worth the drive.  See you next Saturday Little Spoon!"}
{"text":"This place was very cute, rustic, and everything you'd expect a trendy farm-to-table restaurant to look like. The coffee was delicious although the mugs without handles are a bit silly considering the mug our donut holes came out in had a pointless handle...which I envied when I tried to sip my hot cappuccino. Definitely get some coffee regardless.  The pumpkin spice donut holes were tasty although they tasted like plain donuts. The slab bacon snack was deeeeelicious... Thick cut pork belly paired nicely with the sweet donut holes. I had the chicken biscuits which were good although it tasted as if they had previously cooked fish in the same oil/pan they cooked the fried chicken because it had a weird fishy flavor. My SO had the hash and it was okay. The place is alright, quite pricey but I like that they use local foods. I will give them a try again for dinner instead of brunch but I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"We managed to grab a table outside on a Saturday morning with no wait. We both ordered coffee, I wish we had been given more cream, but the coffee was decent. Our mistake came in our food choice, we both ordered the Shashuka. First, it was spicy, which our server didn't mention when I asked her about the dish. I can move past that. when I poked my eggs with my fork, I noticed that they weren't even cooked, the whites were still translucent. I'm not a huge fan of runny yolks, but I absolutely can't stomach runny whites. We probably will return at some point to try a less risky dish, but overall, our first trip was a waste of $30."}
{"text":"Such a great little brunch/lunch spot.  I had heard great things about this little place and decided to try it a few weeks back, since I was moving from Charlotte soon there after.    The decor and ambiance is awesome.  I consider the decor upscale hipster (if that makes sense ;) ) and good old school music was playing while my friend and I were enjoying brunch.   We ordered a carafe of their mimosas to start and the mimosas were delicious.  I believe the juice is freshly squeezed, so the mimosas were not overly sweet and just perfect!   My friend and I ordered the chicken biscuits and the pork banh mi to share and a side of the doughnuts with the chocolate drizzle. The portions are not overly large so it was good we weren't starving (hence why the 4 star rating), but they were very tasty.  The chicken was just ever so lightly fried, extremely crisp and not oily at all.  The pork in the banh mi sandwich was so moist and the bun provided the perfect sweetness to the savory pork. The doughnuts were just okay.  I wasn't a fan of the chocolate sauce.   The service was great.  Our server was a little quirky and made funny jokes.  Overall, we had a great time.  I wish I would have gotten a chance to eat there one more time before I moved. It will definitely be a place I will visit whenever I come up to Charlotte! It is definitely a place I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For atmosphere - I'd give it a 5. Cool menus and young people music.  For food - 3.5 I got the grits with braised rabbit which our waitress and girl who brought our dishes said was their favorite on the menu. It was underwhelming. I described it to friends as a gritty chicken and dumplings minus the dumplings and replaced chicken with rabbit.   My friend got the BLT - It's super thick bacon that was half fat - almost like a short rib. The bread, garlic aioli and tomatoes were excellent.    Service - 2.5 I asked for a chai tea latte to go. Soy is not available but they offered coconut water. The drink tasted like flavored water. Upon asking to make it stronger - I was told \"they make it in house and I'm probably used to the syrup most places use\". Making something in house should make it better - not worse. I prefer \"in-house\" made chai tea drinks to syrup...customers are not always right here.   Another friend mentioned they won't substitute or split things.  Also not a fan of the iPad's they use for checks, it's uncomfortable to ask you to decide the tip while your waitress is holding the screen. Difficult to review your bill as well.  All said - I would probably go back for the vibes and avoid recommendations and the coffee bar."}
{"text":"Typical customer of Little Spoon: OMG I can walk to Little Spoon and it is soooooo good !!!!! :) !!!!  Reality:  This place is awful. Once the parking is fixed and landlord can jack rent they are out of business.    Have been twice. Lunch and breakfast.  Lunch was fine average. Wasn't crowded and food was average.  Those were the positives.  Negatives were you leave hungry and prices are absurd.  If you want a $25 meal and then have to find your second lunch before heading back to work, definitely hit this place up.   Brunch was an unmitigated disaster. I can walk to this place, and parking is non-existent as stated in other reviews, but I harbor no positive vibe.  Waitstaff is indifferent at best. They seem to believe the restaurant is a desirable place to eat and has good food, service and value. They are clearly confused.  Eggs were dry. Bread was stale. Bacon tasted like it was boiled before it was cooked. But at least I got to hear about everybody in the neighborhood's issues on this fine weekend morning as the tables are stacked on top of one another.  At least the waiters have ink, tight pants and mustaches. That makes me feel trendy!  This space will eventually have a good dining experience in it. Little Spoon will not be it."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked basically since living in Charlotte and I finally went here for breakfast. We got there right after they opened and we were the first ones there for a while. My husband ordered a latte and was pleased. For restaurant espresso it was pretty good, obviously going to a local coffee shop would bring slightly different expectations. I ordered a glass of their house made lemonade, it was delicious! Not overly sweet and it was carbonated which I enjoyed.  At this point I'll also mention that they do all locally sourced ingredients from North and South Carolina. Their menu is also a tapas style menu so keep that in mind when thinking of portion size.  We ordered all of our items with the plan to share. The first item we picked were the donuts which came with 3 mini ones on a chocolate ganache. They we're delicious! We also ordered their potato hash without sausage. It was decent, the onions and peppers were higher in proportion to the potato and onions and peppers were slightly undercooked. Overall though the flavor was there. We also ordered the brioche with jalapeño egg white which came with tomato jam. The sandwich was very good but the tomato jam was amazing! I seriously could have just drank it. It tasted like ketchup but with a better tomato flavor and a slightly chunkier quality.  If you are a vegetarian there isn't much on the menu but they seemed flexible with ordering items without the meat.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The wait was quoted about 30-45 minutes and we go in to seat in about 15. Our waitress was knowledgeable. I had the jerk chicken with lettuce cups the chicken fell short of expectations and I found it to be poorly seasoned and bland. The presentation was great and I enjoyed the root vegetables. Our waitress was great for the beginning of the meal but towards the end of the meal she left every person at the table thirsty. The space was a bit cramped but all in all I found the creative environment made up for its short comings. I do feel as though this rating is generous though."}
{"text":"Cute place, music a little loud for breakfast atmosphere, but chai was warm and food was good. A lighter fare."}
{"text":"My husband and I just came back from brunch here and have decided we will never go back. We got mocha lattes and they were terrible, I honestly couldn't get down the first sip so I told the waitress I didn't like it and could I please have an unsweetened iced tea instead. She never took the mocha latte back so I kinda assumed we'd have to pay for it then. A manager came after we ordered asking if we liked sugar, then proceeded to hand us a plate of toast with sugar/cinn saying \"here's some extra\".. We figured they accidentally made some extra and were giving to us for free. So we said thanks and ate some, it was okay. Our entrees were actually pretty good. My husband got the liver mush and I got the pancetta cornbread dish, both good. The side of bacon was lacking some flavor to us, thick but not too tasty. I asked for an unsweet tea to go, and the waitress came back with a sweet tea. Said that the unsweet was out. You also have to pay on an ipad infront of the waitress so that was awkward for my husband. He ended up barely even looking at it because the waitress was standing right there waiting, so it was only afterwards when I found out we ended up paying $6.50 for the free toast a manager gave us, for 2 mochas (which I figured) and the unsweet tea that I got one drink out of since they ran out. Yeah....We won't be returning."}
{"text":"So a neat little spot on Selwyn. The vibe is cool with hip-hop playing in the background. The music was a little too loud because it interfered with conversation and communication with the servers.  Coffee was good. Mimosas were alright. Our carafe was a bit heavy with the champagne. Which is better than the alternative.  DoNut app was good. The meal I ordered however was disappointing.  I ordered Menage which is grits, potato puree, coddled eggs, and toast. The eggs, grits, and puree were served in two cups. One cup was great, perfectly prepared and seasoned. The other was under done, lumpy, and underseasoned. The bacon was great. I just feel if your going to do small trendy plates, you need to nail the execution and they didn't."}
{"text":"Decent brunch but not worth the hype. This was second visit to little spoon since they opened a few years ago. The service was super slow and the hostess had an attitude. There are much better brunch spots in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is the most pretentious restaurant I've ever been to. They first try to be hip by making the menu confusing as hell. They throw in every acronym they can think of and lowercase letters mixed in with some hashtag symbols so you think it's something super cool but really it's just regular potato hash. You can't trick people by NOT having air-conditioning in 80 degree weather and wobbly wooden tables and throw in some early 90s rap music under the guise of being Eco-friendly and hip and then charge over $12 for 3 bites of food in each entree. Even the staff was pretentious. Since the menu was confusing, I asked the waitress if they had any pancakes just to make sure. Instead of just saying a simple \"no\", she passively aggressively told me that if I wanted that there was a nice place down the street. Anyways, if you're going to charge $60 for mediocre tasting brunch, at least have air conditioning. Little Spoon is like that kid in high school who tries way too hard to be cool and can't quite get there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers in Charlotte.  They do a rotating menu but I'm pretty sure you can order a burger Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I love this burger and I heard it was one of the better ones in Charlotte and it did not disappoint.  I also came here for brunch and it was delicious as well. Definitely try the Chicken Biscuit: LS Biscuit/CheerWine Brined Crispy Chicken/Pickle/Garlic Aiol. Definitely one of the better chicken biscuits in all of Charlotte.  They have good music as well as delicious drinks. One of the more hipster places in Charlotte, I really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great brunch! The deviled eggs were delicious! Breakfast tacos, BEC, and chicken biscuits were great! Chai tea lattes were yum! Service was great. Some character in Charlotte with great food!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed- truly poor customer service. For a birthday meal, I organized a group of friends to meet. I have 3 food allergies for ingredients that are not typically listed on the menu and the waitress said she \"had too much going on\" to help me pick an option I could eat. She did not even go ask for more information. I asked other staff, including the hostess, and they would not help me either saying that wasn't their job. When I pressed on with the waitress, she asked me about ingredients by naming them in Spanish... I don't speak Spanish. We waited 70 minutes for a table they said would take 40 minutes and it WAS NOT WORTH IT. Overall, a terrible experience and a huge let down on a birthday with friends."}
{"text":"What a gem!  My daughter invited us here this past weekend and I was blown away!  Liver mush!!  I was amazed that it was on the menu but even more so that it was cooked so well and accompanied by the most amazing duck egg, sunny side up!  From the coffees and lattes to the bacon and donut hole appetizers the meal was better than expected.  It's a busy place so get there early, plan on a loud and vibrant atmosphere but come with an open mind for twist to some amazing foods!"}
{"text":"A farm-to-table brunch spot had better make an amazing Bloody Mary. Theirs was the best I've ever had (and I've had many, haha) The staff was friendly & helpful, the music was jammin', the space looked fresh, the food was excellent (I had the cinnamon toast & purple potatoes), and the check was reasonable. I couldn't ask for much more. The parking lot attendants were kind of d-bags but that's not the restaurant's fault. Just want to give a heads up on that."}
{"text":"Service at this place was awesome. There was a small wait to sit down, however it did not take long to get my food. I ordered a Caramel Latte and Chicken biscuit with over easy eggs...Delicious!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in the restaurant was everything we were told it was going to be. The '90s hip hop music was everything you could hope for, everyone was happy and the service was good.   I ordered the breakfast hot pocket after the server told me how great it was. I thought it was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend and our friends food was very mediocre. Overall I think thus restaurant was overpriced for the about of food that you get."}
{"text":"Our new favorite brunch spot. Small and simple menu done really well. Fun old-school hophop in the background made my hubby really happy and the knowledgable friendly staff made us feel welcome. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to love this place, but I just didn't. Our food took way too long to arrive (we had to ask the waiter about it after watching two tables who arrived after us get their food before we did). The manager came out to apologize, and I understand that delays happen. So no big deal really. But then our food was pretty much tasteless - unless it was sweet. Slab bacon was gorgeous looking but had no taste whatsoever. Jalapeño butter brioche wasn't spicy at all, and there was no seasoning on any of the food within. Boule tasted like bread and egg with thick flavorless meat. And the kicker - no salt or pepper on any tables. The cinnamon French toast was yummy, luckily. And the donuts were flavorless except for the syrupy berries around them. I'm so sad to have to give it a less than positive review. Especially after all the raves I've heard. My fingers are crossed that things get more flavorful over time."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch experience. The music was old school hip-hop.   The menu had a little of everything on there. I had the hash, which was delicious. One friend got the special which was Pork Benedict, another a salad and a slab of bacon and another the hot-pocket with lamb.   Highly recommended you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We travel from Winston to here because it is so good!! The food is awesome and super fresh. Their coffee is spot on.   Most of all we love the customer service. Ryan (the chef) is super awesome and SO friendly. We love coming here and always feel welcome. Plus their music taste is DOPE!!   You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to this nifty establishment, which I believe is fairly new to the Charlotte area. The atmosphere and setup is very inviting from the start. I loved how the menus were setup differently. On little metal clipboards with the initials cut out. The menu itself is very enticing, so much so I wish I could've tried a bit of everything. I however opted for the shrimp and grits with a poached egg in the center. Right away I noticed the serving dish which was little smaller than I would've liked, but I went ain't with. The gravy was awesome and the grits were done good. My friend ordered the Wings and the Hash with gravy and eggs on top. He made the best choices. Those wings are AMAAAAZING!!! Fried just right and the gochugang sauce is great. Wet and yet still crispy like I love. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for mother's day and was pretty disappointed. Food: 1 for 3 with my party the hash came out on top but the chicken biscuits were served on cold biscuits. The Porchetta was a miss as well, only good thing about it was the cornbread it was served on. Service: Our waitress tried her best for a smooth service but it seemed like the iPad gimmick was causing more problems then keeping efficiency. 2 of the folks in my party didn't get their spiked coffees till well into their meals. 1 individual had to send their coffee back multiple times because the order wasn't right, blaming the tech here not the server. Serving hot coffee in mugs without handles (aka bowls) was a bit difficult to navigate if you like to drink your coffee hot but not trying to singe your hands on the bowl. Recommend the spiked iced coffee with patron XO and the caramel about the only other thing I can recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the poor reviews. Hip place serving great brunch!  We had more traditional style breakfast such as hash with chicken sausage and homemade scones, but tried the pork belly style bacon...fab!  I want to go back for the Limosa and sticky rice dishes.  Drinks were more creative than typical mimosa and music was dope. 90s rap.  Thanks LittleSpoon for a great time!"}
{"text":"The fella and I ventured in on the first Sunday they were open, which made me a little nervous, but I didn't need to be. They open at 9:00, and when we got there at 8:50, there were already people inside. Turns out the kitchen doesn't open til 9:00, but they let in the early birds for coffee while you wait. So nice!  I love how they transformed it from when it was FABO - exposed brick, dark wood tables, beautiful hutch over the coffee bar, open kitchen window, clear globes over the warm hanging lights. There are some tables outside, and a few in the front and back of the restaurant, but the bulk is one, long bench along the wall with individual tables, so we quickly got to know our neighbors.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful, explaining the menu and checking in just the right amount of times. The menu was broken up into appetizers, sandwiches, fork and knife, and sides. It's definitely not your \"traditional\" menu, and I wondered how the many families with kids in there were doing with such grown-up fare.  The fella got the Hot Pocket, which looked like a calzone and was filled with scrambled eggs, ham, and a creamy sauce, and a Slab of Bacon side. He loved the Hot Pocket but said it needed \"more stuff,\" and although the bacon was his favorite, it tasted too much like pork for me. I got the Pop Tart (homemade dough filled with three different types of fruit jam), and the Cinnamon Toast Brulee, which was deeeelicious. It was two slices of thick bread that had bruleed cinnamon sugar on top.  The most impressive part? The coffee. It comes in a cup (vat?) so big there's not even a handle and you need both hands to drink it. It's bold and dark and fantastic. Mmmmm.  Breakfast was a little pricey - all that cost us $37 - so littleSpoon isn't somewhere we'd come all the time, but it'll be a nice treat when we do go back!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The server was snarky about my friends' Boston hat. She was a Huston Astros fan....she made that clear to me after I laughed at her comment and said I'm  a Yankees fan.  She said she was sorry to me for being a Yankees fan. She never checked back with us after our food arrived. My friend had to get his own coffee from the server area. When we asked for separate checks a friend clarified who went on each check, she replied in a flippant manner and said \"I heard\".  Rude service with an attitude...no thanks.  We will go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Recently had brunch here and it was the bomb. Our server (Robert) made awesome recommendations & gave great service. I had the shakshuka and it was so good. Everyone at our table loved their food. The coffee and mimosas were delicious too. I will definitely be back because everything on the menu looked amazing & we had such a hard time deciding on what to order."}
{"text":"First time here and I love this place. Delicious food food. Although people seem to complain about their musical selection,  I really like it. I had the shrimp roll, as my main course while my party and I split some bison meatballs and bacon. Quite delicious. The only gripe I have (which is no fault of theirs as its shared with other businesses) is the driveway  to get in and out can be a bit tricky to negotiate."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, or if this was typical... We were seated right by the kitchen window, which was pouring smoke. This was foreshadowing. We had the cinnamon toast brulee first. Parts were burnt. My partner ordered the burger of the day. It came out burnt. I had the chicken biscuits. The chicken was good, but a tad under seasoned. The biscuits seemed old and were dry. Our waitress was friendly and did the best she could with a bad situation in the kitchen. She removed our beverages and the burnt burger from the tab. However, the food just couldn't convince us to come back."}
{"text":"Heard great things about the food, and it was true. Customer service was a total let down. Very rude staff."}
{"text":"My last day in Charlotte and of course I had to do brunch with the family and my bestie. My mother wanted to try something new- Lil Spoon appeared to have  options outside of your traditional grits and eggs.    The location is in the same center as Mellow Mushroom. There is parking  at the back of the building.  The area is a little congested,  and I can see it being problematic if there are a lot of patrons at the center.   I went in ahead of my group to see how long the wait was. We arrived around 12:30 or so, and my party of 5 was immediately able to be seated. The staff was extremely accommodating. I advised that my 98 year old granny  was in my party and they allowed us to come in through the back door. As we were entering a staff member was headed out and even held the door for us. Once in, our table was already set up for us, and we did not have to go far with granny. Big kudos for this!!   Our wait staff was Anne. She was sweet and even  mentioned that my granny made her think of her grandmother whom she had not seen in a number of years.   We were provided with a container of water for the table, I always love this idea.  No need to keep coming back to the table to refill cups of water!  I also ordered the caramel latte with coconut milk. As a starter the table shared the deviled eggs. You get 5 deviled eggs, which was perfect for our group.   We also ordered the French toast, the hashed and the SEC. the French toast was the winner of all of the items we tried.   My mother and bestie both had the hashed, both agreed they would not re- order. They felt in needed additional flavor. The SEC was basically a chicken sausage egg and cheese sandwich. I enjoyed it, but would likely try something else on my return. I almost forgot to mention, they also accommodated my mother splitting her hashed with my granny.  It came out in two dishes, already separated--- NICE!!   I would love to come back to try  other menu options.  I like the fact that they have selections to cover a variety of dietary plans.  They also have a decent selection of coffee drinks and even offer alcoholic shots as add ins!!    If you are looking for a quaint spot for brunch- look no further! Not only will you be impressed with the food, but the service will exceed your expectations. ... oh yeah, the music played in the background was a  score, think old school hip hip!"}
{"text":"LittleSpoon is a go-to restaurant, specially in the Myers Park/Dilsworth area, for breakfast/lunch. I went midday on a Saturday and had a scrumptious brunch. The menu features mainly dishes that are quite eccentric and abnormal, but nonetheless delicious. Most if not if not all of the ingredients the restaurant uses are sourced locally. There is even a chalkboard in the restaurant that colorfully lists the farms the restaurant works with and utilizes. The restaurant is on the small side, although there's outdoor seating, there isn't ample space so there may be a wait at peak hours. But this eatery is definitely a must-go, especially for those who appreciate an enjoyably funky dining experience."}
{"text":"The food is definitely top-notch! You should prepare yourself for some wait, but it will be worth your time! Farm-to-table dishes, great cocktail options and cool ambiance - this place has it all."}
{"text":"Maximizing profit! Incredibly small portion size of grits, eggs and sweet potatoes. I don't think these ingredients are particularly expensive, but 13  dollars for 2 eggs, between 1-2 ounces of grits, and 1-2 ounces sweet potatoes; this plate did taste good, but it's hard to enjoy when you do the math. We also got the \"risotto\" sweet potatoes and a poached egg.  The sweet potatoes were severely undercooked, and peppered by everyone in the kitchen, and possibly everyone in the dinning room eating(my back was too the entire restaurant, it tasted like this happened.) $11.   Can someone please explain to me the appeal of sour espresso and why it's so prevalent in Charlotte? Espresso should be rich and chocolatey."}
{"text":"Smaller restaurant, but the wait was not bad. There are a great variety of foods and drinks. Not a French bistro but some of there foods are inspired by French cuisine. Brunch was reasonably priced, but don't forget you can't order a mimosa before 12 on Sunday."}
{"text":"Solid service and food. The coffee \"bowl\" threw me for a loop I have to admit but I really enjoyed the concept. I got the Brulee'd Cinnamon Toast on a whim to take home, parts of the sugar were burnt which kind of ruins the whole bite if you get a piece. It's hard to go wrong with those ingredients but I was disappointed. I prefer the butter, white bread, and cinnamon sugar that we all grew up with.   The music was nice but I came there super early and I'm not really a fan of hip hop at 8am. I saw some reviews mention 90's hip hop which would have been an easier listen than the stuff they had on. I'd rather just listen to the city wake up and enjoy some peace than Big Sean. That's just a personal preference though.   The food is great and the service was good. Their reputation is well earned."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and subpar.I ate with three other people and they agreed . I was expecting the food to be better by the appearance .My friend got the chicken biscuit and the biscuit was very dry. They charged $19 for a burger that was lacking in flavor and did not come with a side. This place is a one time try."}
{"text":"This place is more than just a brunch spot. I had dinner here a week or so ago, awesome small plates and specials. I had the ceviche and a pork belly taco, delish! Locally owned and you can find easy parking under the building. Would be a nice date spot too:)"}
{"text":"Came in to have brunch for my birthday. It was my first time there and I was looking for somewhere cozy with good food. Jennifer J. was our server. She was awesome! Super friendly, knowledgeable, and patient! (I had a lot of questions). I ordered the Brussels and Porchetta (with chicken instead of pork). Both were absolutely delicious. I appreciate the various options and accommodations, especially since I don't eat pork. I will definitely come back and try some other things as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love the farm fresh ingredients, and the entire atmosphere!! This place is definitely worth a try! I will be back! The pork belly bacon is a must have!"}
{"text":"Liver Mush - DO IT! I love the music. I love the atmosphere. Brunch is the business. Great service. I love to eat here. It's a good way to brighten the day."}
{"text":"Just because you have old school music playing in the background with modern décor does not mean that you  are in the clear, at the end of the day, if you claim to be a restaurant, the FOOD needs to be good, right? I am not sure why people in that area make such a fuss about this place, the food is mediocre at best. Super simple, maybe too simple, dishes plated to look more appealing and described more complicated than it needs to be, for what? The staff is friendly enough, drinks are OK but there wasn't anything that \"wowed\" me enough to return to that side of town since my last two attempts. I typically give restaurants two tries, the first try for overall and the second just to be sure. Now they moved Comida, a sister restaurant that was in Plaza Midwood, that didn't do well....well because the food there isn't that great either. So why not have both mediocre spots in one, winner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Sunday brunch. The music was fantastic (90's hip hop), and the decor was really cool. The french toast brulee sounded great, but was basically toast with butter, cinnamon and sugar, not worth $6.  The fried chicken biscuits were okay, biscuits were very dry, but the garlic aioli on the side helped a little and tasted wonderful. My boyfriend has one of the specials with a cut of beef, and sauteed veggies.  He said it was pretty good, but I cannot comment on that, because I didn't try it.  Coffee was great, even though there were coffee grinds in mine.  The server poured it and saw as she was pouring, and just walked away! Pure Intentions coffee always brings it though, so I still drank it. Our server wasn't the best, she forgot when I asked for a box, and ignored us for 10-15 minutes when we were clearly done.  All in all, I would give it another shot, maybe for a weekday lunch rather than brunch.  It ended up being a little over $50 for coffees, toast, and two brunch items.  A little hefty for what we got in my opinion."}
{"text":"Literally the stupidest brunch time waiting game. We arrived at 1:50, tables were empty, nobody was hanging around the restaurant waiting, and the hostess literally told us she's not allowed to add anyone to the waiting list. That they were full until 3pm which is when brunch ends. We left and I checked Yelp where the waiting time for the restaurant said 8-18 minutes. I put my name on the wait list, it said there was 1 party ahead of me. 10 minutes later I got a call that our table had been ready for 10 minutes. I asked them how come it wasn't ready when we were there 10 minutes ago? She said she wasn't \"allowed\" to add anyone to the waitlist. Yet I could add myself on Yelp? They literally turned away the group in front of us and us because of this nonsense. Hire a new hostess or get your act together."}
{"text":"Rare day date for husband and me.   The porchetta. Omg. Amazing. My husband had that and it was all I could do to not steal the entire plate from him.  I had the hash. It was good but a little spicy for my total lame taste buds. Husband assures me it wasn't spicy if you're anyone but me ;-)  We also ordered the donuts and the side of bacon. The donuts were good but not good enough to order again. Very sweet. The bacon was fantastic. Husband has not shut up about it and we are a couple weeks out from this meal.  He had the bloody mar. I had the mimosa. They were $10-11 each, the mimosa was very small and they were both just ok. I think next time I'd just enjoy coffee or order a more interesting drink for those prices.  Waitress was a doll, suggesting menu items and quick with refills, etc.  Patio was delightful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and service was spot on. The music gets you pepped up and it's a nice change of pace to the normal restaurant. Highly recommend the chicken biscuit for brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a very small but nice restaurant. They are located in a shopping strip area with plenty of parking in a lot and the deck. Because the restaurant is small there is always a wait. They have various coffee beverages that you can get spiked which is nice however you can't really taste the coffee spiked flavor. Maybe they can give more then a shot of liquor. The food was flavorful and decent portions the prices were affordable. The biscuits were hard but the chicken inside was yummy. The bacon was thick and a juicy slab. If you aren't use to that style watch out you will get the itis easily from eating it. The hash was good I wish it had more veggies... it just had the peppers. The staff were friendly and they were accommodating with families or children. The chairs weren't that comfortable. The place was clean and decor was electric. Overall it's nice, but they can be great. It's up to them."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for breakfast.   Layout was cute, rustic and well done. Unfortunately service wasn't good and people did not make us feel welcomed.   Had bacon egg cheese on roll,  looked amazing but sunny side egg was rubbery and tough.      Check out on ipads allowed for 18, 20 or 25% tip would have preferred to give 10% to alert waitress and hopefully owner that service is a problem.    Hope they can work out the kinks"}
{"text":"It is so hot in here, temperature wise.   Their weekend offering is really not that great for having to wait for an hour. No veggies this weekend. They ran out of Brussels sprouts. Disappointing because I eat very little poultry and other meats are totally off limits. They have a grilled cheese that I can make at home.   The waitress is pretty bland. I asked to review the menu and the waitress never came back to see if I wanted anything. Ever.   She also never gave me my change so I could tip her properly. I wanted to add to it but since she chose to steal my money she lost out.   Best part is that it is across from a TCBY and I can go get yogurt.   The music being played is good.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here with a large party for Sunday brunch. Interesting, funky semi-industrial decor is overwhelmed by loud hip hop-esque music the second you enter the restaurant. Menus were industrial funky and somewhat minimalist, but in a good way IMO. Service was quick although some in our party didn't like our waiter. The crowd was a mix of hipster and middle-aged with kids, but I wonder if the latter were only there since it was Sunday brunch. I had grits with chicken sausage and it was innovative and excellent, but I wished for a bigger serving. Their hash was also excellent and unique. A big disappointment was their bloody mary, which the waiter said wasn't spicy but the 4 people at our table all agreed they clearly were - and apart from that the taste wasn't much. If you aren't interested in talking to your fellow diners or like to shout at them while eating innovative food and washing it down with an average drink in a semi-pretentious environment, this place is for you."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Saturday for brunch. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. At first the tracks from Outkast, Jay-Z, Nas and the like felt awkward given the neighborhood. I always think people won't be able to appreciate that music because it's so old, but to hear it brought back memories of my childhood from the 99 and the 2000. I sat outside, which was lovely to see all the people out in the neighborhood. Started to get a little warm, but there are some fans. The atmosphere is like a relaxed brunch lounge. Almost reminds me of 5church without all the acrylic decor, and more menu options at decent prices.   Anyway, the food. It was great. I had the cinnamon toast brûlée I think it's called. It was really just bread with some type of melted sugar on top. Super fattening, but delicious. I had a mimosa, which wasn't anything too spectacular. It was made with Cava, which tasted kind of flat. I love Cava, as much as I love mimosas so that was a little disappointing.  I also had the jerk chicken lettuce cups. Really good! If you like a lot of food this is a good dish. The lettuce cups had so much filling I couldn't pick them up. It's a healthy meal minus the mayonnaise from the slaw, if they used mayo,  and light enough where you won't feel stuffed. Although I couldn't eat the whole entree it served me well later.   I will definitely be coming back to Little Spoon."}
{"text":"I stopped by Little Spoon this morning for brunch around 11am and lun had to wait 10 minutes for a table. I was able to grab a coffee (which was excellent) at the coffee bar to drink while we waited and had free refills of the coffee throughout brunch. My only issue was that the coffee mugs had no handles! Was a little hot to hold.   The atmosphere is very modern but charming -- with lots of clever touches. We ordered the cinnamon brioche toast to start and it was melt in your mouth. Definitely recommend! I had the breakfast quinoa with blueberries and walnuts to start and it was yummy and comforting and still vaguely healthy! Can't complain about that. My boyfriend had their daily special (goat cheese grits, succotash, lamb chorizo and more) and raved about it.   Service was friendly and we will definitely be back! Love the farm to table philosophy and reasonable prices. Highly recommend it for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is so dumb. Pretentious, overpriced, subpar food. The service was terrible. Our waitress knew what we were looking for on the menu (mimosas) and stood there staring at us blankly while we flipped through the pages looking for it and not once did she try to guide us through the pages of laughable menu items. Biscuits were dry and rock hard. The #menage (seriously, that's a dish name) was like baby food with a raw egg on top. The coffee cups with no handles are ridiculous. Basically this place wants to be one of those New York bistros where the servers act better than you and you have to take out a second mortgage to afford brunch, but they can't even make a decent biscuit. My friend and I spent $70 each and left hungry. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and it was fantastic. It is a great spot for brunch. I tried the curdled eggs and they were delicious. Our waitress was great and helped us decide what items to try being that it was out first time. When I asked about dinner she informed us that they open for dinner on Thursday nights and that the menu changes. I thought that was really cool! She also shared that they are opening a restaurant in Plaza Midwood and I am exited to give that a try too! Do yourself a favor and come here for brunch! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday.. the decoration and set up was nice.. they play hip hop music at a loud volume for such a small and packed place.. it took forever to get our food! Over 40 minutes.. not even the appetizers came out quicker.. I got the \"special\" burger.. ok taste.. wouldn't order it again. The deviled eggs where amazing! My friend got the shrimp and corn grits.. the only reason I would go back.. would be to get the shrimp and grits to GO!"}
{"text":"The server was great ! Food was awesome. We had the chicken biscuit and the livermush. The chicken biscuit comes with 2 so it could easily be shared. The biscuits were home made and amazing ! The livermush was homemade and really good. We also ordered the side of potatoes which was a huge portion !   I had an iced caramel latte which was better then a Starbucks latte !   My only complaints would be the hostess and the music....she was very rude when we were checking in and being seated. They were blasting loud rap music which is fine except when every other word is a cuss word not really what I want to hear at brunch at 10:30 am :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food,  great coffee,  and great energy. The brussel sprouts were delicious. The hash was excellent and the coffee have me life. I also had some of the most delicious fresh squeezed grapefruit juice! I can't wait to come back. This place and there playlist will go in my top brunch places!"}
{"text":"My friends and I headed to LittleSpoon after the gym on a Saturday morning. We sat outside because the wait for inside tables was really long. The spot we sat at was a bit awkward because it was right next to the entrance door. Our waitress changed about four times and took a bit for our food to come out. After paying, another waitress came back and handed us another check. I don't think they were on the same page. The coffee cups were also the size of cereal bowls. It was just OK."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Sunday and it was pretty good. The music was amazing, server was amazing, coffee was amazing and my meal was pretty good as well. We got the deviled egg appetizer, sticky rice meal, and the hash. All was good. My boyfriend did say a few of his potatoes in the hash were kinda hard. Not sure what happened there. But overall great experience. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place may be called LittleSpoon but no spoon required (at least for what I got). I'm fact the menu pretty much tells you what's needed and the have a section for hands and sporks. My favorite item may have been found on the snack menu.  The Korean Brussel sprouts are out of bounds. Fried and had a delicious  Korean sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Found myself dipping potatoes from my order of hash in it. Lol  Just needed bacon and they may have been the best sprouts I ever had. Also for the hash and it was pretty good as well. Love it when the egg bust and runs all over the potatoes. It comes with chicken sausage and onions. Keep in mind and probably should have led with this - the ingredients here at LOCAL. Which I love they do that .  Yes you can find some items that aren't so healthy like the Donuts but get the donuts as they are delicious. Coffee was good as well and didn't mind using both hands to sip out of this large  cup. Added bonus is you get a great energy here from 90s hip hop on deck. Takes me back.  As the the song goes ...Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see ,sometimes your food hypnotize me"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me, so a few friends decided to try it.  I was not impressed at all.  I ordered the grits entree and the sauce it was topped with was so acidic and vinegary I could barely eat it.   The grits themselves were okay but all the nonsense around them were not good at all.  The biscuit I ordered was also very dry and tasted a bit stale; wasn't fresh at all.  Now I didn't expect it to come fresh out of the oven, but the thing was practically cold.    The only highlights were the chai latte with coconut milk I ordered and the blackberry jam that I topped the biscuit.  Both were superb.  I also have to give it to them on the atmosphere--the place itself is set up very nicely and although I was a bit surprised by the choice of music.  Overall, I won't be going back; I'll make my grits at home and save the $14 it costs to eat them here."}
{"text":"Good: clean, comforting decor, pleasant staff, brief but solid menu, quality and presentation of food, bathroom ambiance.  Bad: when it's full it is obnoxiously loud. seating is tooo tight. like the people seated next to us felt like they were with our party. iced coffee tasted like it was instant coffee with a stale bite. a little pricey for the quantity that you get BUT most items are locally sourced and some are organic so I give it a tiny pass.   Still deciding if I will be back...."}
{"text":"Chef Miles Payne nails it.  The food was original/fantastic.  The short rib sandwich was a favorite at the table.  The atmosphere was electric and service was great.  Super friendly!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service and an enjoyable atmosphere at an outdoor table. However the food was mostly large pieces of meat. Pork belly in the BLT ( not bacon) was flavorful well seasoned, moist and tender but just a huge chunk of meat in sandwich bread with a little lettuce and tomato. My husband's chicken sandwich lacked flavor and was another big chunk of meat. The squash soup was flavorful but basically broth. I'm not a big meat fan so this would not be my choice to come back to."}
{"text":"Awesome service, ambience and food! The warm drinks were not what I expected, specifically the hot chocolate and latte- they were heavy on the milk and not the flavor. Food was great though, I had the hash with a medium egg on top. First time eating purple potatoes and the dish was great! Some in my party had the burger, which had thickk slices of bacon and was served on a housemade donut bun. I think it may have been a special that day.. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Although I made reservations for our party several days in advance, they were able to accommodate the additional 3 people that joined us at the last minute.  Also, we sat outside, on a day that was more chilly than most during the week, and they had heaters on outside, which was great, except the wind overpowered the flames. Something to keep in mind if you consider eating outside on a not-so-nice day.  Last but not least - the music! Loved it!! They had Pandora on a hip hop station which worked great for us, made the ambience that much nicer. Although I realize this may not tickle everyone's fancy, made our day. I would definitely come back, had a great experience overall."}
{"text":"This place is definitely different than your traditional Charlotte brunch spot.  The ambiance inside kind of reminds me of restaurants in Bucktown/Wicker Park, Chicago a little bit.  The choices are unique, but I think we went in desiring some of the more traditional brunch fare.  For someone that is craving your standard savory (egg type dish like a benedict) or sweet (Pancakes/french toast) brunch type dish, there aren't that many choices to fulfill those desires.  Since not much was jumping out at me, I went for the burger.  Overall, it was a decent burger, but a $14 burger without sides is a bit of a stretch.  I wish the waitress would have highlighted that it didn't come with anything.  Usually for brunch, you'd expect grits, potatoes, fruit, etc. as a side, especially at that price point.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but there are so many great places to get brunch in this town, I can't say we'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"First thing first... I have to tell you that my boyfriend enjoyed this spot WAY more than I did. I thought it was fine, perhaps even better than fine. But, if he was writing this review, they'd have 10 stars. So, maybe this is a \"dude\" place. I dunno.   As other reviewers have said, they do blast old school rap and hip hop. I kinda liked it but will admit, it didn't fit the rest of the \"scene.\" We went early enough that the restaurant wasn't packed (maybe 6-8 full tables) so it wasn't crazy loud.   The food was all solid. Potatoes with housemade ketchup and garlic aioli were great. I had the chicken biscuits, also delish! The bacon wasn't quite my cup of tea (more like pork belly) but my boyfriend loved it.   My one real complaint are those damn hipster coffee bowls without handles. I ordered a coconut milk cappuccino which was delicious... once it cooled down enough for me to be able to pick it up to taste. Because the cups don't have handles and they're serving hot coffee in them, they're simply too hot to pick up for the first 10-15 minutes your coffee arrives. There's not much I hate more in the world than having to wait on coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"This was such a cute brunch spot. I love the atmosphere and music. I ordered the sticky rice and it was AMAZING. The bloody was just okay."}
{"text":"Little spoon has a nice brunch with even better music!  It's very popular so I suggest making a reservation or going early.  We had a group of 6 and had an estimated wait time of 45-1 hour at noon.  What I loved most was the 90's hip hop that played during our meal... Biggie, Wu-Tang, Tu-PAC... it definitely brought me back!  The highlights of the meal included the breakfast potatoes with poutine (gravy and bacon), donut holes and the spicy Brussel sprouts.  My chicken biscuit had yummy chicken but the biscuit was sadly way to dry for my liking.  The bloody Mary was tasty but really small for the $11 price tag.  Overall this is a fun cozy spot and I would probably go to again!"}
{"text":"Good brunch place in Charlotte! Everything we had wasn't \"wow!\" but still very good! If we were to go back, I would definitely order the hash again along with the oatmeal. The shakshuka was pretty good but can be fennel heavy and I didn't prefer the carrots inside. The Korean brussel sprouts and BTF (basically fancy home style potatoes) were amazing! We also ordered the donuts - not super impressed. Would definitely come back for select dishes. Longggg wait on the weekends though!"}
{"text":"I recently read an article stating that little spoon was one of the best brunch places in Charlotte, being an avid lover of all things breakfast I decided to try. I'm a culinary student and I was very disappointed. I really want to open my own farm to table restaurant but I want to actually give the food flavor. The atmosphere was awesome. I went with a friend after church on Sunday, we ordered a latte and an Americano, both were really good. We then ordered the starters of the donut holes and the potatoes. I was really pleased with the display but for $6 you get 3 donut holes that taste very similar to day old Dunkin, not the best. The potatoes were the only thing I ordered that I really liked, the garlic aioli set it off and the potatoes were purple so that made things festive. For our entrees she ordered the Breakfast sandwich with their version of bacon and after trying hers I really liked it, not a fan of fat but you have to expect that from pork belly bacon. They didn't offer sides, the sides were the starters. I was really wanting a delicious burger, because that's what people raved about, but no burger was even on the menu and when I asked the waitress the specials she said there were none, but later I watched them deliver a burger to someone, sad. Instead I ordered the chicken biscuits. Being from North Carolina the thing that really made me want them aside from the homemade pickles was the chicken soaked in cheer wine, but to my dismay they tasted nothing like cheer wine, not even a little. And the biscuit part was the real disappointment...I got over everything else but this...the biscuit was disgusting. It was very dry and all the give you on the plate and biscuit is aioli, which was great but did not help at all. I ordered an over medium egg on the side (for an extra $2 which is what you could get 12 eggs for) and it didn't even help moisten the biscuit, so I ended up leaving the overdone, crumbly, flavorless biscuits on the plate and ate the chicken and egg. All in all I give this place 2 stars sadly because I was really looking forward to it and I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"SETTING: Clean wooden and metal decor. Dim lighting. Old-school hip hop playing audibly (but not obnoxiously) in the background makes this brunch place unique and trendy. Plenty of customers bobbing their head to the bass while ordering/eating.    FOOD: First single off my most recent album \"Bass & Brunch\" DJ, drop that beat... Got the Chicken Biscuit. Garlic aioli to dip it. On the side. I like the extra \"oomf\", no lie (no lie). Not a big enough serving to get me full, but enough to satisfy.  Why they call it \"Little\" Spoon? Wish it was more B-I-G. Though the fried chicken was tender and pretty tasty. Not the biggest pieces for the price. Without the biscuits, the chicken could be finished in two bites.  Overall it was solid, and I'm glad I came through. Just wish the biscuits were more moist and more flavorful too. Brunch life (brunch life!). *Drop the mic*  SERVICE: Good service and fast for a busy morning. Our waiter kept coming back to fill our waters and to check up on us.  IMPRESSIONS: I'm a fan of the concept. I enjoy hip hop music and brunch food. Together? Why not! At the minimum, I really wish the portions were a bit bigger. Also, the bathroom was a kind of dirty and that gave me the shivers.  I assume this place is kid-friendly. I didn't hear any \"bad words\" come on the tracks, nor did I see any \"parental advisory\" signs in this joint."}
{"text":"Every time i would go to the mall i would drive by this little restaurant and wonder if it was as good as it looked. Spoiler warning: it is.   I went to brunch here a couple weeks back and was happily blown away. This was luckily one of the weekends when it really warmed up so we got to sit outside. This is such a cute little place with a very weird choice of music. I chose the Chicken Biscuit after a recommendation from the server and was amazed. The biscuits would have been good on their own but adding the Cheer Wine Brined Crispy Chicken and garlic aioli it takes it to another level. I would have licked the plate but i thought that may have been frowned upon. The two friends I went with got the #BEC and the *SEC. They were both thoroughly impressed with their dishes. We all split a side of bacon as well. They bacon is definitely the star of this restaurant. It is house cured and absolutely fantastically thick and so rich. Whatever you do when you go here get the bacon it will change your life."}
{"text":"The #bec is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life...nice outdoor patio...I really felt like a hipster eating locally sourced food while listening to rap music and eating foods that had a hashtag in the name...the ipa I ordered came in a can...that was the only letdown."}
{"text":"Such a fun environment and wonderful food!  We met some friends at Little Spoon for a Sunday Brunch.  There was something awesome about some fun 90s hip hop while enjoying brunch!  I had the Chicken Biscuits and my wife had the BEC.  Yes - it does meet the hype.  The food is top notch!  I highly recommend the drink menu as well.  They have some fantastic cocktails on that that pair nicely with the brunch!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere. But I wouldn't waste my time/money. Good service. For such small plates, they really need more items to choose from, like tapas style. At least I can say I tried it."}
{"text":"So cute but blasting party music so loud it's difficult to hear your fellow diner (at 8a breakfast) is just awful. We ordered coffee so had to stay put...  Very sweet waitress - we asked about a slight lowering and she said they wouldn't even if asked. So we shouted and repeated ourselves until we finished most our coffee and headed to another spot for breakfast.   Very edgy atmosphere I guess...will not repeat mistake and wish them luck."}
{"text":"Little Spoon was on my brunch to-try list for awhile, and my girlfriend and I were finally able to give it a shot today. The food was above average but not amazing, and the service was solid.  As others have mentioned, I really like the 90's hip hop music and the laid back vibe of the restaurant, even down to the menu! The waitstaff all seemed very chill but not too laid back to be inattentive, and our food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. I ordered the shashuka, which consists of two eggs in a spicy marinara sauce with toasted bread. It was pretty tasty, but I would have liked a lot more bread. I got three small triangles, and the tomato sauce and runny eggs seemed too much like a soup without anything to dip. My girlfriend got the chicken biscuit, which actually comes as two sliders. The biscuits were fluffy and tender, and the chicken pieces were tasty, although a bit small. The pickled cucumbers and dip/spread on the side (some type of aioli possibly) both added great flavor too. We tried the 8 minute cookies as a dessert...avoid these! They weren't horrible, but they weren't even as good as store-bought cookie dough and were only 4 very small cookies for $6. Overall, the food was solid, albeit a bit lacking for the price, but I'd be willing to come back here."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Few breakfast selections to pick from so we went with the basic egg, bacon, cheese sandwiches. I'm more of a crisp overcooked bacon lover. Their bacon is a slab of ham; definitely too thick and chewy for me so I gave it to my husband. Otherwise food was delicious and our server couldn't have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and did like the vibe and the music. There was no wait for a late lunch on a Wednesday. My guest and I shared a couple of apps and a sandwich and it was more than enough food. We went with the Brussels and the fried potato apps. Both great. Probably didn't need the turkey sandwich but got it anyway. May have a been a touch dry but it is turkey after all. Reasonable prices and the service was impeccable. Will be back to try the burger!"}
{"text":"Cute ambience. Great location.  They got everything right but the food.  The menu is too short with none of your standard breakfast items.  We came hungry and left hungry.  Unfortunately, we won't be returning unless the menu changes."}
{"text":"After reading good things about this place, I was pretty disappointed. With a plethora of wonderful brunch options in Charlotte, Little Spoon really needs to reconsider their food offerings and especially their price point.  I ordered the \"menage,\" advertised to come with eggs, grits, sweet potato puree, and ciabatta. The dish came and it was two very small bowls of puree and grits with eggs cracked on top. Looking around at other tables, the dishes looked quite small despite all items being $10+. I left still hungry and disappointed in my strange dish.  I think Little Spoon has a unique, hipster vibe and their menu is inventive. However, it is simply not cutting it when I can get phenomenal omelets or biscuits elsewhere for half the price and twice the quantity."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was terrible. Waited over 40 minutes to be sat, after hostess said it was a 20 minute wait. Waitress was inattentive and only showed twice. Food is always good, but the service let me down."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now and the food is always delicious and prompt. There is a fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit that I love and a donut hole plate that we've shared as well as the cinnamon toast. All good options!"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday morning for breakfast, very good menu with everything farm to table.  They had the most interesting menu of combinations you wouldn't think would taste good together and they were delicious. Can't wait to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Great brunch/breakfast.  Hip interior and music.  The food is tasty with creative paring of ingredients.  The bacon is amazing- nothing like what you buy or get at most resturants.  Meaty and mildly salty.  Loved it so much I ordered some to go.  Great granny smith apple juice.  The only item I didn't like we're the meatballs. .which were extremely dry.  They lose a star for service because on the occasions all my waiters were not good.  Forgetfull, snobby, not friendly.  My last visit they brought me the wrong juice- and instead of admitting the mistake- the waiter insults my intelligence by saying \"well its organic - so we can't guarantee taste\".  Do fresh juice about every week so I know apples from grapefruit. Smh"}
{"text":"Such a missed opportunity. The menu is both interesting and fun, the location is great and the lively atmosphere gives the place a bigger city feeling. But the service, where friendly and keen lacks any kind of organization which leads to an average wait time of 45 minutes at the weekend peak hours. A duration the food simply cannot justify... sorry this one to avoid."}
{"text":"Very unique breakfast in a great location with an exceptionally tasteful decor. Little Spoon's food quality and menu is absolutely stellar.   So why have I stopped making this a regular stop? The music. Its so bad it makes me angry. During my last visit the manager was actually singing along with \"Eye of the Tiger\". Survivor was an embarrassment 30 years ago, honey; time hasn't helped. Not only is the music selection horrific, but the volume levels are obnoxious. It's Sunday morning, I'm hung over. Shut the **** up, bring me quality food and good coffee.I can't  hear a word my breakfast companion is saying - and shouting hurts.    Heed this warning:  If you go, bring headphones. You'll love the food, I promise.   Its such a shame that they can't hit on all facets. This place is so close to being perfect."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time recently. I loved the ambiance, nice interior and location. However, it is a bit pricy for the amount of food you receive. Otherwise I loved it, especially the bacon."}
{"text":"Ummmm....maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  I wasn't thrilled with my lunch at little spoon.  I got the Quinoa Bowl...it was interesting to say the least.  Hubs got the turkey sandwich...took a bite of that and it was good. I'll have to try it again and order something different! Place was cool,though, and service was friendly and great.  Lots of pretty people enjoying a Saturday afternoon lunch!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place wasn't as great as I thought it would be. The menu definitely got me! I love places that have different things and the items on their menu sounded really good and more unique than other restaurants around the area.   I was most excited for the Shashuka. While the menu lists a couple of the ingredients in the dish, it tasted like eggs with tomato sauce. There wasn't much of a kick to the dish and it was pretty boring. The steak sandwich (I forgot the name on the menu) was also not what I was expecting. The meat was pretty dry, and it comes with a sauce. The sauce, that I assume is for dipping, was watery and had no taste to it. I was impressed with the cinnamon toast brulee though. It was quite tasty so I recommend that if you go here!  Overall, the place is alright. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon, especially since it is on the pricey side. It's cute on the inside though."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. My shakshuka was great, the coffee was very fresh/delicious and it's a fun atmosphere. Service was great as well. Baked goods for sharing were fantastic and worth the calories."}
{"text":"Completely unimpressed.  Arrived around 1:30.  There was no one inside and 2 tables outside.  Sat outside because inside smelled funny...in a bad way.   The music was completely inappropriate in my opinion.  Hard to enjoy lunch with explicit rap music in the background.  The prices were high.  I got the chicken on a lettuce wrap..VERY small amount with water to drink and it was $13.00.  The service was worse than bad.  The waitress never came back to check after the food was delivered.  She never did bring the club soda I requested.  When she did return I was ready for my check and she stood there and waited while I paid on the iPad.  I hate that form of payment.  I like calculating my tip in private.....  Anyway, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Little Spoon! The chicken sandwich and sausage, egg, and cheese were fantastic.  Also, they Mexican Coca-Cola made with real sugar cane, my fave!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"JUST WOW...why did it take us so long to try this I really have no idea.  It's a small place where they play quality old school hip hop.  You know they have good taste in music when the chef is rockin a wutang clan hat.  The donuts were a great starter, chocolate sauce is on point!  The Breakfast tacos were amazingly healthy fresh and delicious.  They make their own in-house salsa verde...made with perfection.  And the coffee was strong which is just how I like it.  The service was great and we will definitely be back with our friends and family."}
{"text":"I DONT GET IT. This a la carte culture in the food world is getting ridiculous. More money for less food. It would be one thing if the food was really good, but it's just okay. 10 dollars for a bowl of heirloom tomato wedges?? The server was nice enough and knowledgable, but that's about it. Don't waste your time.   Also the valet service in that strip mall is terrible. Complementary service? Sure why not! They insisted that I just have them park it so I obliged. Except They pulled up ten minutes after I gave them my ticket because they don't know what they're doing, and it's not that big of a lot. And they pulled up with my girlfriends car with the trunk open. Why? who knows.   So. 30 dollars for a hamburger, a tomato salad, and a bowl of coffee (just put it in a mug, for goodness sake), plus a 6 dollar tip is 20%, and then a tip for the incompetent valet if you're not a crappy person is over 40 dollars just for lunch. If you're a rich person who needs somewhere to spend your money, go to Little Spoon. If you're just a person who wants good food at a reasonable price (or even someone who doesn't mind paying more for ACTUALLY good food with decent portions), then go somewhere else.   Just finished this review shortly after my meal and I'm already hungry, if that gives you an idea."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the third and final time (we hadn't been in a year and were quickly reminded why). It is still overpriced and underwhelming. We ordered the deviled eggs, hash, and roll-up. The deviled eggs were good, but under-seasoned. The roll up had good texture but was bland (i.e., just scrambled eggs inside; very unimaginative). The hash was a disappointment all-around, as the potatoes were grossly undercooked/raw, and the sausage and peppers were too greasy. There are much better options in the area for less than the $50 we spent."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday breakfast with my girlfriend. Service was top notch, staff was very friendly and place has an awesome vibe. Our waitress was Emma and she was awesome. Love the coffee served in a bowl, really good stuff. I had the Porchetta which is a take on biscuits and gravy but swap the biscuit for big piece of cornbread. It was of this world. Girlfriend got the shrimp and grits and loved them. To top it off, we split an order of the pork belly bacon and let me tell you, this is a must try. Overall, great experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pros - trendy environment, air of fun, menu reads interesting, location is great  Okay, but not fantastic - food  Cons - loud, nothing to absorb sound, pricing ratio to value of food, parking, small crowded space, waitstaff is really bad  I honestly, probably will not go back.  It is very overpriced, and the clincher, when I asked for my tea to go, and the waitress could not be bothered to fill up my glass of tea.  Very Disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was so good and I loved the staff. they were so funky/cool. The grits and duck was my fave."}
{"text":"Interesting place. I am not sure who the targeted audience is, but during my visit I discovered a classic hipster design (brick wall, Edison bulbs and high top tables included), a simplified almost cafe like menu and the smooth rapping of the Notorious B.I.G. (Big Popq was playing). I enjoyed my breakfast but wonder what usual crowd is like.  Tip: parking garage with attendant and nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food may be good? But I wouldn't know!  Called, emailed, and and even sent Instagram message to buy tix to an event the were having and no one ever responded.  Called several times for a week or 2. Tried again after a week and a half of trying and got gentleman on the phone. He wasn't pleasant and  informed me that event was sold out? But how can that be if no one ever responds to your inquiry? Smh"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot! The flash fried potatoes are to die for. Good vibes here , love the fun music!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the snack and brunch options on a Saturday morning. Tasty little handmade donuts, pork belly bacon, a delicious and hearty hash plus excellent coffee. Our server went above and beyond, and really made us feel at home."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. Paid close to $75 for brunch and all I had to show for it was quarter size, crunchy \"donuts,\" and I forgot everything else we had bc it was mediocre at best. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love a fancy menu and farm to table concept ..... However, the menu for breakfast is SOOOOO limited that I struggled to find anything I wanted. What I got was just, well, meh. My friend's dish was not much better. I'll try them again but wasn't overly impressed. Cool atmosphere is bumping them from a 2 to a 3! :)"}
{"text":"The food is still so-so, but our most recent experience there prompted me to write an updated review. We had the porridge, which was quite nice.. the shushuka, which was a bit too tomato-ey, and the turkey sandwich which I personally was not a fan of because the turkey came in thick slabs, while I was expecting something quite different. The customer service however, is what really made the experience a not-so-worthwhile one. We sat outdoors to enjoy the beautiful morning, but it was all very quickly destroyed by the very loud 90's hip hop music on the speaker right above our heads. You expect to yell and talk to people at a nightclub, not so much at a Sunday brunch when they're sitting at the same table as you.. After repeated requests from us, and the tables around us, the volume remained unchanged. Apparently the staff there isn't allowed to adjust the volume? Saving grace was that the music was pretty good... but I still left with a headache."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch to check it out but left disappointed. Let me start from the beginning... Plenty of open tables outside and hostess seats us at the one right in front of the door. Really?? You put us at the worst table in the whole place. The table was also broken. We ask to move to a different table.   We order coffees and then offered 100 options for creamer...coconut milk is bit of an overkill don't you think? They bring out bowls of coffee. No, not mugs but bowls with no handles...what is this place??    What continues is the $13 BLT on the menu. I'm sorry I don't care how good you bacon or tomatoes are that you bought down the street from Joe the farmer but $13 is a bit ridiculous. I ordered the hash also $13. It was just ok. Very oily and my over medium egg was hard as a rock. I get all the details and I usually appreciate them but the food has to be the star of the show.    Lastly the iPads....connection issues to start and I get you want to be tech-savvy and eco friendly but please don't have your waitresses wait holding the iPad while your customers tries to pay (with cash) and sort out the tip. It's just awkward. Either leave them with the table or don't use them. Plenty of San Fran restaurants have them as menus too and they aren't waiting for you to steal them. You have to get over that if you want to use them.   Unfortunately, I'm not sure we'll be back. I'm all for farm to table restaurants but breakfast/brunch is simple and not over complicated. This place is over complicated. It's trying to be everything and just hasn't found its identity yet. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I would say both times I was happy with my food. Unfortunately, both times the service was pretty awful.  First time - Sunday morning brunch. Ordered the BTF potatoes as an appetizer (they're very good). I ordered a sausage egg and cheese, my girlfriend got a bacon egg and cheese. First thing out: bacon egg and cheese. 5 minutes later: potatoes. 10 minutes later After my girlfriend had finished her BEC cause I insisted she eat, my SEC came out.   Second time - Mother's Day. Went into knowing there'd probably be a wait. Told us 20 minutes. After 25 minutes we went to ask how much longer. Well apparently they had gotten \"too backed up\" and had to stop taking orders for 20 minutes, so add another 20 to our wait.   Unimpressed all in all."}
{"text":"Well, I have been saving my energy for this review.  What a huge disappointment!!  I was so excited to try this new place out.  The location is great, the interior is trendy, but the greatness stops there.    Parking: forget about it.  Leave your car at the gas station for a full up and go grab a bite to eat.  That's your best bet for parking.    Service: the waitress could care less and probably took lesson on how to avoid the customer even when they are staring you down.  I say she must have been valedictorian of her class!! Oh, and you have to pay at the table with an iPad while they stare at you. That makes tipping crappy service even more awkward.    Dining: I thought I would need an ambulance by the time I left.  I kept trying to put my feet under my chair, due to the limited space under the table for two sets of legs, and there was a metal bar that kept lacerating my foot.  I felt like I was sitting in a chair designed to be uncomfortable so you do not stay too long.    Food: way too greasy, bacon is way too thick, and the bread for the breakfast sandwich is hard enough to break a window.    The coffee cups have no handles so you boil the skin off of your hands while trying to enjoy a morning cup of Joe.  The orange juice that was freshly squeezed was okay, but it came in a cup so small that it seemed as though I was drinking a sample from a grocery store salesman.    Take home lesson about this experience, avoid this place until they have a more organized and user friendly concept."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place. We were there early (unusual for us) and only a few tables were occupied. They asked us if we wanted inside or out. It was 53 degrees so..... in?  Didn't matter since all the doors were open but eventually the good coffee kept us warm. Service was very good and food was a little above average but not great for a place that is a bit pricey and somewhat pretentious. Agree on the double up-charge a previous poster mentioned. Not cool.   Anyway, they were piping loud rap music which I often enjoy but looking around, there was a family with three young kids and an 80 yo couple. The lyrics of the song we sat down to were beyond explicit and it just didn't seem like a good time to be hearing so many F bombs and what they wanted to do to p*ssy. Perhaps if they change their name to Lil' Poon, I would have been more prepared for the breakfast experience we were walking into."}
{"text":"Décor and quality of ingredients deserve 5 Stars, so why am I only giving it 3 stars?....  As soon as I walked in I was very impressed with the tasteful atmosphere of Little Spoon.  It has a very pleasant and chill vibe to it.  The menu is limited which they attribute to only using what ingredients are available locally.  I can appreciate that.  But the menu is really Very limited.    We settled on two dishes to split as we weren't overly hungry.  We got the vegetable pappardelle and the BLT. I also ordered an unsweetened iced tea.  30 minutes later our food finally arrived.  The restaurant was only half full so why it took so long is beyond me.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  But something was backing the kitchen up.  Anyway...  When our food came I was extremely impressed with the presentation.  Absolutely beautiful!  The \"pappardelle\" was thinly sliced root veggies that were fried like chips.  They were tasty.   A really nice starter.  The BLT looked amazing, and for $18 it sure needs to!  That may be the most expensive sandwich that I have ordered, ever.  I've lived in NYC, San Francisco, and Chicago.  And even in those food focused and much more expensive cities, I never ordered a sandwich anywhere that was nearly that expensive. And it didn't come with any sides. The bread was thick and looked like toasty goodness.  The bacon was some of the thickest slices that I have very seen.  There was bright bib lettuce, a purple heirloom tomato, a fried egg, and an herbed aioli!  Lifted this glorious sandwich to my mouth preparing for a culinary orgasm!!!.... and tasted.... Nothing.  How, HOW, it is possible to make such a perfect combination of top notch ingredients so bland is beyond me.  I was confused, momentarily fearing that I had lost my sense of taste.  I quickly popped another veggie chip into my mouth to confirm that my taste buds were indeed still functional and took another bite of this picture worthy sandwich and thought \"NO!  How can this be that I taste almost nothing!!!\".  I am still confused by how it is possible to make something so devoid of flavor.  As we were departing the waitress asked if I wanted an iced tea to go, which I thought was a very nice touch.    $33 dollars later for a sandwich and chips I was up and outta there.  To sum it up:  Great décor and presentation.  Friendly wait staff.   Slow kitchen. Very limited menu.  Forgettable food.  Very high prices.  I was really looking forward to trying Little Spoon.  Sadly, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Yum! We came during peak time on Sunday, but got a table within 10 minutes. I grabbed the chef burger which was HUGE and a order of potatoes. My friend grabbed the French toast, donuts and bacon. All great! The food came out pretty fast also. And they have the best playlist. Drake and Wayne on repeat on a Sunday morning? Lit"}
{"text":"Great new little place! The coffee is served in a bowl! Cant get better than that! We ordered the poptart, the egg white jalapeño sandwich with tomato jam and the bacon and runny egg bule. Soo so sooo yummy! The portions are smaller for the price, but the food is amazing so it didnt matter. The outdoor seating was great too. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"This place is quirky, charming and inviting. Absolutely love it. I took my mom here for a birthday brunch when she was in town in July and she's been chomping at the bit to get back ever since! We both still rave about their coffee and homemade poptarts."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice before and the food was great. Then we went last Sunday and it was like a totally different restaurant. The grits were basically not cooked sitting in hot water, it was terrible. The \"Cuban\" dip was not even edible - the meat was dry and grey (basically way over cooked) if I order something with ribeye on it... At least have it cooked medium! It was basically cremated dry grey ashes! We paid and when we walked outside my husband and I agreed it was never worth going back. 50$ for some of the worst food I've had in Charlotte. Such a shame and a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the mixed reviews are correct. I wanted to try this place for myself to see if the experience would be good, but sadly I have more negative things that only add to two stars.   Service = no good. Our waitress took a long time and then was not helpful. I asked about a breakfast egg and cheese sandwich menu item that said it is served on a roll. Could you tell me more about the roll I asked. \"It's just a roll, and toasted.\"  Since I didn't have a back up item, I decided to go with that. I proceeded to get a hamburger bun for my breakfast sandwich. Are you kidding me!  Also on the service, yes the iPad at the table payment is awkward having to tip bad service right there.   Location/ambiance = more negative than positive. It was really hot inside and we were sweating. Unfortunately I am not exaggerating. We couldn't get out quick enough. The parking situation is very tough to get in and out of there. The decor was really nice visually I have to say. Unfortunately the chairs were very uncomfortable and the coffee mugs were completely unacceptable. No handles and you burn your hands.   Overall. For the price, you should skip Little Spoon."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Little Spoon. I've driven by tons of times and always noticed the crowd that gathers for Sunday brunch and thought, \"I'd like to try that place.\"  Well, I was not disappointed. We had the pork belly bacon and doughnuts for starters. Perfect salty and sweet combination. For an entree, I had the hash and my girlfriend had the chicken biscuits. Both were solid choices, with a little flair thrown in. The rest of the menu seemed simple and inventive and there were several things I will be trying our next visit. To top it off, I was very impressed by the inexpensive price for the great quality we got! This will be a place I recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of this place, but I'm glad my friend mentioned it. We came here for brunch on a beautiful day. They had the windows/doors opened, which made for a great environment. The food quality was great, but the menu is out there. If you're into trying unusual foods, I can't imagine there are many places in Charlotte that can compare. I opted for the grilled cheese and tomato soup, but quickly regretted my decision when I tried my friend's chicken biscuit. I think this is something they are known for, and I would suggest you try this. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"After looking at photos and the menu we were stoked to tryout the unique eats at Little Spoon. The restaurant is located in a quaint spot on Selwyn, next to Mellow Mushroom.   The menu was limited to a few selections that all sound really great on paper. One interesting item was the cinnamon sugar toast, but for some reason it doesn't have much taste. Maybe it needs more butter. The breakfast sandwich we got was pretty good, but it was very greasy and the bacon was really undercooked.   The prices are a little bit high here and the environment is kind of cramped for what you get. Reading the menu was the most delicious part."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  Never been here before, but our waitress, Sheraton, was wonderful! She was able to explain how all of the ingredients were local and where they came from, very well informed and very friendly! The food was delicious!! Took a little longer than you would expect at a regular restaurant, but this company is not about fast food - it's truly about the quality and how everything is prepared. If you're in a rush this is not the place to choose, but a relaxing weekend brunch - this place hits the spot!!  Best tip about this place: the coffee is served in BOWLS!! just the size I like : )   Plus, they are on the up & up with technology too - paid the bill on an iPad right at my table."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in here for breakfast one morning before picking up a friend in the area. It's a cute little restaurant in a really adorable and walkable spot.   My mom ordered a coffee, cinnamon toast, and we shared a side of bacon (aka pork bellies). She loved the coffee and the cinnamon toast - I stole a bite too and the toast was pretty delicious. But we both agreed the pork bellies left something to be desired. They weren't seasoned very well and only the very ends were really cooked through/rendered enough on the outside. I ended up ordering the SEC breakfast sandwich and I thought it was really good - the breakfast sausage definitely beats the bacon here, and I'm a sucker for a runny yolk. It was a tad bread heavy though, so I ended up eating it as an open-face sandwich with just the bottom piece.   I would consider giving them another try, but overall it's far from my favorite spot and the pricing seemed high for toast and breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Solid spot with quick service, great ambiance, and solid food. Great coffee selections, food options, and easy parking."}
{"text":"With a quote from nas \"fried chicken\" song I knew right away I would like this place.  I got the liver mush.  David got the grits with rabbit topped with an egg.  The eggs were cooked PERFECT and every bite was delicious.  No wait and friendly staff.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was such an incredible surprise. We came for breakfast, had incredible coffee, a chicken biscuit, and loved the music. The staff was friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome. I asked about the t shirts that the staff had on and she said that they were sold out, but insisted on taking my information so she could call me when they came in.  My friend and I both worked in the service industry for a long time and we always appreciate being made to feel like a valued guest. Little Spoon didn't disappoint. We will likely come back again at least once more before our trip to CLT is over!"}
{"text":"Awesome seasonal dishes, prompt service, cool and funky vibe! The coffee cup thing seems like an absolutely bizarre thing to mention in a review - but yes - they use handless mug. Like they type you see all over crate and barrel or William & Sonoma. I thought they were charming - and only mention them because they seem to surprise the other reviewers. If the coffee mug is the only thing we can find the knock - this joint is doing pretty good. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.  Great service. Any brunch spot that pumps the old school beats like Tribe Called Quest is a win in my book.  Highly recommend for Charlotte."}
{"text":"went here for brunch with my girlfriends.  Not really a fan of the fact that they don't have a lot of options. $6 for potatoes? $13 for a hash? Not really for me.   I DO however love the decor, and the location. Service was great as well.  Best part was that they play old school hip hop music the whole time.  Gotta love a good throw back ;)"}
{"text":"Farm to table?  Yes Please!  This place is located right off Selwyn and I have always wondered what it would be like to get breakfast here on the weekend.  Luckily I tried it out the other day and was super impressed.  It was a beautiful fall morning... just finished an 11 mile run so I was definitely hungry.  We got there fairly early and people had started trickling in for a Saturday.  Decided on eating outside and getting some sun for a change, but it was near perfect.  Our server Sheridan (spelling?) was really nice, we explained it was our \"first time\" here so she gave us the run-down on their approach to food and how the menu depends on what they were able to get locally, etc.  Menu is constantly changing so be prepared!  I basically wanted to order everything because it all sounded good.  I can't remember my drink's official name, but it was based off a recommendation for a nice \"patio\" drink.  Tito's, grapefruit juice, rosemary... reminded me of a Moscow mule, but lighter.  I ordered some slab bacon - of which I should have brought a change of pants with me (sorry if that was TMI, but man.... SO GOOD!  And I went with the day's special of Steak and Eggs.  The eggs were perfectly poached and the yolk provided a nice dressing for the bed of arugula that they rested on in combination of the chipotle aioli sauce.    The rotating menu and super fresh ingredients may be a little off-putting to folks, especially if you are expecting this place to be competitive with a breakfast/brunch diner that slings out breakfast to the masses.  But the approach and care that Little Spoon takes into its food make it all worth it (to me)."}
{"text":"My wife and I treated my in-laws to a late morning breakfast one Saturday. It was crowded, but our wait was not long.  The place is quite small, so the seating is intimate so don't expect a lot of elbow room.  The staff is friendly; however they had hip hop blaring which came across like they were trying to be too hip.  Hearing DMX that time of the morning lends it more for evening drinks than a relaxing breakfast.  The food was eclectic, and not your typical breakfast fare.  We started with cinnamon toast and blueberry pop tarts.  The pop tart was delicious; however the toast was nothing you couldn't make at home.  My food was good. I had a small boule sandwich which included a runny egg, slab bacon and cheddar cheese. But it was $16 and the size of my palm. However my wife and mother-in-law found their chicken baguette and grits special quite bland.   My biggest concern about this place is value. The food wasn't worth it given the big prices, the small portions and the mediocre taste and presentation.  The place could reach it's potential with smaller prices, larger portions and greater tastes."}
{"text":"Great food and great environment!  The music on the weekends is upbeat.  They serve filtered water which I have never seen before and the food is sourced locally.  Fresh food and service was great!  I think it is just a bit on the expensive side for the amount of food you get but other than that it is fantastic."}
{"text":"YES - You want to eat here. I wasn't sure what to order at first - it's not your usual breakfast menu, but that's what makes it so great.   I started with a latte as I looked over the menu - best decision ever. They use Pure Intentions' espresso blend. I've been craving another latte ever since.   I ordered a #BEC (Runny egg, bacon, white cheddar on a grilled roll)  And the best decision I made that day... I ordered the #BTF (Potatoes baked, torn, fried)  Five stars because it really really was."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch kind of place! Great vibes! Waitress was very friendly! This place provides a good diverse selection of alcoholic drinks! One is able to sit outside on a nice day! I ordered the \"Sticky Rice\" ($13) Spork! It has a nice flavor to it, however me being born and raised in an Asian culture, the rice can be stickier. I also ordered the LS Slab Bacon ($6.5) ! Very good, and thick bacon!  Great place for a date, a brunch, or just with casual friends! Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go for months now to Little Spoon and finally today I went! The space is very urban/mod for Charlotte. Which I am so happy to see!!! Charlotte could use more restaurants like Little Spoon to break up some of the stuffyness thats around. The environment was very hip and the music was boppin'.   I have been to a few farm to table restaurants in the Charlotte area lately and they are definitely one of the most legitimate sourcing the foods from North Carolina and South Carolina.    I had the following:   Chicken and gravy biscuits. They were delicious. (This is coming from someone born and raised in NC) I will say they were not the traditional gravy and biscuits but boy did they have a mouthwatering twist.   The bacon was spot on. Yes it is a little thicker than your typical bacon but it was AMAZING!   The coffee does come in a mug basically the size of a bowl but if you're a coffee lover like me who doesn't want a bowl of coffee?   My boyfriend had the donut burger and it was so good he finished it by the time I was half way through my FIRST biscuit.   The service was great, friendly, and attentive!   Yes it is a little odd to tip the person on the iPad but if you are embarrassed to tip in front of them then maybe you are being a little stingy. Also, I saw a couple come in 5 minutes until close and they welcomed the customers with open arms.   I will be back little spoon and I'll need a bigger spoon next time ;)"}
{"text":"Listen... I honestly don't know how long the wait was originally, I was too busy two-stepping through the door! The music and the vibe of this place for BRUNCH is wonder-fabulous!   Everyone was smiling, talking and enjoying the music! I believe the hostess originally told us that the wait was about 30+ minutes, but I received a text that our table was ready after about 10 minutes, so that worked out perfect!   We were seated outside, but never felt disconnected from the ambiance of the place nor did we sacrifice service... our waitress greeted us within three minutes. The menu is ever-changing (so I've been told) so that's what keeps it new and fresh. I decided to go with the chicken biscuits and beau enjoyed an order of livermush (yuck! for me). It took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive and it looked just like the pictures on the website and from other Yelpers (I like true representation of food, I'm weird like that lol).   My chicken biscuits were soooo good. Almost two good because they were flaking all over the place. Without any shame, I just picked up the pieces from my plate and enjoyed them. Ultimately, my plate look like a toddler learning how to eat for the first time by themselves, but it was so good that I didn't care. Not to mention, my neighbor ordered the same thing and he too was struggling with keeping the fresh biscuit together. Clearly, we didn't care and you shouldn't either if that's what you decide to go with.   Ultimately, I WILL BE BACK (mainly because my mom FaceTimed while I was there and she was hype over the music and now wants to go)! If you're in the Park Road area and you haven't tried LittleSpoon, you're missing out on the good stuff!"}
