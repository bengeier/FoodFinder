{"text":"This is a serviceable, but not exciting, Americanized Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do for Chinese food in the Avondale/Goodyear area.  My wife and I ordered the orange chicken meal, the Mongolian beef meal, and a small hot and sour soup. The meals seem to be a good deal to add several extras to an entrée for only a dollar or so. Choosing the meal upgrade trades out your white rice from the standard entrée for some lo mein noodles and some fried rice. In addition, you get a single vegetable eggroll and a single fried cheese puff. These extras add volume and variety to your meal without being particularly interesting or delicious. From a food-volume-for-price perspective, it is a good deal, but you shouldn't expect any of the extras to be special. The eggroll in particular was extremely subpar, As it reminded me of an eggroll I could have bought frozen and cooked at my own home. The cheese puff was delicious, but then again it's difficult to screw up fried dough with a lump of cream cheese in the middle. The \"fried rice\" really looks to be nothing more then some rice which was made brown by some kind of unremarkable sauce. The lo mein was similarly disappointing, there was very little to it other than noodles and some sauce, although the sauce did add a nice flavor. The hot and sour soup was one of the high points, as the broth was a deep rich brown with a little bit of thickness to it, it had a generous amounts of tofu cabbage mushrooms etc. and the hot and sour flavors were nicely balanced.  My wife's orange chicken was tasty, but literally included nothing other than the chicken and the sauce. It did not even include the standard steamed broccoli to add a little bit of vegetable into the meal. There wasn't even the pretense of adding something healthy here, and the vegetables were sorely missed. The Mongolian beef was quite delicious but similarly unhealthy. It consisted of reasonably tender chunks of beef extremely large amount of sauce, and green onions along with slices of regular onion which had been stirfried with the beef. From my experience this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Mongolian beef.  My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of variety on the menu. They were probably only about 10 different beef dishes, a handful of vegetable dishes, seven or eight seafood dishes, and the same number of chicken dishes. I couldn't find a single item on the menu with eggplant in it. What kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have eggplant and beef on the menu? There were a handful of Chinese/Thai offerings, but as someone who greatly enjoys Thai food, I would never risk ordering even a simple curry from a restaurant like this.  So long as you're expecting cheap Americanized Chinese food, you will get what you pay for. I can see us returning to this restaurant for that purpose at some point, but not often. Make sure what you like to order is on the menu before going, because even certain standard offerings maybe missing."}
{"text":"Have gone to this restaurant for years. I like the fact that they have Boba teas available."}
{"text":"Food was nice and hot. Loved the crab puffs. Mongolian beef was a bit on the sweet side. Customer service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I know there aren't many good Chinese places in Arizona, or many other  good places at all, but this one was decent. I have ordered take out from here several times, and it was good. The service was good, portions were big, and the food was consistent each time I ordered. The mongolian beef was great"}
{"text":"This place was great. The server (probably the owner) was so very nice and friendly. The food came out really fast and was delicious. We had chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice - portion sizes are large and there was lots of meat in both. The spring rolls were piping hot and had a good flavor. The prices are good and they have a large selection of dishes. The restaurant was extremely clean and had good atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not exist at the stated location.  I used GPS Navigation and everything, but there is nothing there but old houses."}
{"text":"I recommend the Cantonese Noodles these are ala Monterey Park, Ca. True authentic Chinese cuisine"}
{"text":"I've been to AJK a number of times and it is always good. I've had the ma-po tofu, garlic chicken, and pad thai. I enjoyed the ma-po the most out of those three dishes - it had a thick and flavorful sauce that had me wanting more.  The ingredients have always seem pretty fresh. The service was good. The interior of the place is done very nicely, they definitely put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the place. I am used to many Chinese places being completely bare bones in terms of interior, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Also! on a side note, I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks. They only have milk tea and Thai tea, but both are really good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Simply stated:  1. It's Clean 2. Friendly/Great Customer Service 3. Reasonably Priced 3. Outstanding Food (with large portions).   What more can you ask for in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their lo mein and beef and broccoli! The vegetables are always so tender and full of flavor. This has become a regular place to eat for my family and we are never disappointed. I fell in love with their milk tea boba!! I even took one to go. The staff is always nice and friendly!! The only time i wasn't impressed was when we ordered the chicken wings. They were ao bland and flavorless and they just threw jalapeño slices on top. Other than that everything is delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time visitors, and we were pleasantly surprised.  The food is very tasty and reasonably priced.  We were impressed with the many menu selections.  We also like the atmosphere - a comfortable place.  (The 'stars' are cool!) Service was very fast, however, we were there early (about 5pm) and there were not many patrons at that time on a weekday. We will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes for the price you pay, I always have leftover to save for lunch the next day. the restaurant offers many selections ,i asked the waitress for her favorite recommendation and she recommend the beef chow fun.it was amazing, I never would have chose it. Very unique style of thick  noodle mixed with bean sprouts and beef for a lovely texture be sure to give this dish a try, it's my new go to comfort Chinese food.  She also recommended the soy sauce noodle which I thought sounds so boring but ended up totally different than what it sounds like! Soy sauce noodle is a crispy noodle fried with lots of vegetable and some meat. A thick Chinese sauce is added to the crispy noodle when served ,u need to eat it quick before the noodle get too soggy from this dish. the texture is one of a kind and I believe u have to dine in to get the experience with the texture because take out you can't experience it the same way (needs to be eaten fresh after it's cooked ). Again, I'm truly amazed by these 2 dishes,I will keep coming back for them because I haven't tried Chinese food like this before! The Thai tea boba is very good here too!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I got duck fried rice (which I've never had before) and it was pretty good. It was different from the fried rice I'm used to but less greasy so maybe not a bad thing. Teriyaki chicken was good although not the best we've had.  Cheese puffs are gross.definitely not a Rangoon or crab puff and waaay too sweet for my taste. It was okay but I'm still looking for something awesome out here in Goodyear and this simply isn't it. It's the best option we have found, but nothing compares to our favorite joint out in Peoria (Big Heng on 75th & Peoria)."}
{"text":"Great service. Very polite. Clean restaurant. Great tasting food. Reasonably priced. Great variety."}
{"text":"\"This place is amazing.  As far as I'm concerned, it's the best in the West Valley.\"  Really?  The best?    I admit that, when it comes to Chinese food, there isn't much in the West Valley.  Then again, unless we're talking Mexican, there isn't much in the West Valley ... period.  It's been that way since I came out here in 1993; it'll probably be that way after I die of food poisoning from one of these stellar places (and after one of the restaurant owners I've reviewed reads one of my contributions, the \"food poisoning\" may not be so accidental or coincidental).  First, I really like the nearly all-wood decor of the place.  I know the \"fashion\" for those who aren't old and obsolete dinosaurs is plastic and glass.  Whatever.  I like wood.  It gives a warm and cozy feeling and this place has it  (the ceiling with twinkling stars ... ehhh ... it's okay).  We had the family dinner for two.  The price ($23.95 + tax without drinks) is reasonable.  The Hot n Sour soup was tasty:  filled with peanut oil just like the Hot n Sour Soup I'm used to from back East.  A little light on the meat and a bit too sweet for my tastes, but acceptable.  The egg rolls had nearly no meat and were very crisp.  Frankly, I LIKE all-vegetable and crispy egg rolls and the tighter the cabbage is packed in, the better.  Cheese puff ... okay.  Wasn't supposed to be a \"crab puff\", so they're not trying to deceive and it was tasty.  Now the main meal.  This is where the place gets less \"amazing\".  I had the Szechuan Chicken and am wondering if maybe they brought the wrong dish?  I've never had a version of this dish, where the chicken was crispy coated and the sauce was sweet.  My other half had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was, sadly, standard for second-rate Chinese restaurants:  small cubes of celery, bamboo, zucchini ... and smaller cuts of, I think, chicken.  Neither tasted bad; neither overwhelmed.  Service was fast ... one might say, \"too fast\":  in a take-out situation, you WANT them falling over each other.  At a sit down meal, you really don't want them bringing courses before you're done with the previous one.  As I said to my fellow diner, \"The only thing missing is them standing in a corner, watching expectingly and waiting to swoop down on us as we took our last bite.\"  So, in conclusion, while I agree that the pickings in Avondale/Goodyear are slim, this is no excuse to tolerate something one step above the food court in Target.  If you really think this place is something to give 4 or 5 stars to, then I beg you to either get in your car and drive the 20 miles into Phoenix to find something more palatable or, if you don't have a car, drop me a line and we'll go out to dinner one day.  I'll consider it a civic duty and a generous gift to your taste buds."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese food restaurants I've ever ate at. Everything I've ever tried here was delicious. Food always comes out hot and taste fresh. Best part you can dine in or take out, and did I mention it's always fresh and hottt :). The staff is always friendly and nice as well. This is the best and only chinese food I eat here in arizona since I moved here from Cali. Well atleast on the West side I don't go to the east side very often. I love their egg rolls and the Lo Mein Noodles, those are my favs, however the lunch special are a fabulous hit as well, price good and a enough to have left overs for later, I always order the #6 Garlic Chicken w/all noodles and a extra egg roll, because did I mention the noodles and egg rolls are my favs. So if your ever on the west side of town get off at Dysart and it's on the right side of Fry's. Even if your in a hurry did I mention Their Fasttt, I don't think I mentioned that :)"}
{"text":"Brought my daughters here for the first time! It was very delicious and I'm addicted to the chicken egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The portion size were large and the price was reasonable. The atmosphere was quiet and the place was spotless. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a casual and yummy place to have excellent Chineese food. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is worst Chinese food I have had, never would go there again, Pork Chop Sue was like soup, so much sauce and sweet sour shrimp was fishy"}
{"text":"Amazing! Clean, quiet, and the best Chinese food in town.  I'm always so surprised they don't have more customers.  I think it's because the exterior looks so small and non-descript from the outside.  Once you walk into their dining area the ambiance is impressive.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  The West Valley's best kept secret."}
{"text":"Twice cooked pork was excellent. I will definitely be back to eat again and again. We also had the garlic chicken and that was very good."}
{"text":"Not bad but not one of the best in the area. Food was just okay and was without any unique or memorable flavors.  I was sat and asked for my drink order to which I stated I would have hot tea. She disappeared to get my drink. Shortly later she came back and asked if I was ready to order (still did not have my hot tea) so I ordered my dinner of pork fried rice, sweet and sour shrimp and a cup of egg drop soup. A few minutes later, before I had my drink or my soup she brought out the plate of pork fried rice. I sat there for another five minutes before she brought my soup and drink.   So I then sat there and ate my soup, the pork fried rice and drank my tea for about 15 minutes until the last part of my dinner (sweet and sour shrimp) was brought out.  The timing of the meal and my drink really messed up the experience and I basically ate the sweet and sour shrimp as a desert since everything else came out at the wrong times.  Don't know that I'll be back to this place."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  We ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35.  Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good.  They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy.  Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots.  Mapo tofu wasn't bad.  I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested.  Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch.  I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it.  Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship!  Places like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!"}
{"text":"I was pleased to find they offer duck on their menu & the portion of duck fried rice I ordered was plentiful. (Didn't blow my hair back, though)  I placed an order to go and was pleased with the item, but there wasn't anything special or terrible about it. I may have to try a dine-in experience just to see if we can give this place more stars."}
{"text":"LOVE!  This place!  Best Chinese food place I've ever been to!  Great service,  fresh food,  nice establishment and awesome ceiling!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here. Nice variety and reasonably priced. Food tastes good and service is prompt."}
{"text":"Very nice place clean service really good prices are affordable food excellent, atmosphere really good"}
{"text":"Really good customer service & great food. The dinning room is nice & peaceful, the waitress was super polite"}
{"text":"This place deserves every star. Excellent service and even better food. Other Chinese food places in the area are fine but usually disappoint, somehow messing up a seemingly easy order. I find my self looking forward to the next time I stop by and see the extremely friendly AJKs staff again. My new favorite Chinese restaurant! Would highly recommend for family and close friends."}
{"text":"We have visited AJK several times now and are very impressed.  Fresh produce / food, good menu selection, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  My wife has tried several items and has really enjoyed them all, I really like the General Tso pork (yes pork, I had only seen chicken before).  Be sure to look up when dining for your dinner under the stars!  Keep up the good work down there at AJK!"}
{"text":"The service was so sweet and friendly! It started off with the young man taking our order he was very nice. When we were done the older woman even boxed up and bagged my food for me. 5 stars for the service.  But the reason I only gave 4 stars is because we ordered the orange chicken lunch combo, the sauce was too runny and didn't taste like orange chicken to me :( I was bummed. The lo mein was bland and the fried rice was dark and greasy. Couldn't eat it. My man ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch combo and he liked it but we both thought they could use more flavor! Good prices though!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices.  In the Fry's parking lot.  Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"First time in for lunch. Clean dining room nice staff and generals chicken was really good. Excellent value. Give this a try!"}
{"text":"I was starving late one night. First problem, never make food choices when you're hungry - plan ahead. So I'm searching for anything that is open and I try this place out. Quick and easy - never again.   First mapquest sends me in the wrong direction, then when I call for help the server tells me it's across from Lowe's? It would be clearer to say it's across from Walmart!   I ordered Cheese Puffs (I should have known to change my order when I asked if the cheese puffs were wontons or rangoon and the lady on the phone said \"no cheese puffs\"). I half accepted some deep fried Chetto. But this was actually the only enjoyable part of the meal. Honey Sesame Shrimp was over cooked with little taste. It was suppose to come with shrimp fried rice but instead I was given tasteless brown rice and a vegetable spring roll that I never tried because the rest of the meal was so disappointing.   This is in no way authentic and I bases on my experience it was barely good on a Sunday night. But maybe that's because I forgot to pray over it since I was so hungry. Only Pro: it helped me stay on my diet."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this Chinese restaurant in Avondale. We had a lot of different items on the menu, and all were delicious. One great stand out at AJK is the amount of food you get for your money, Large dinner plates for a very reasonable price. Overall I would go to AJK again when wanting great affordable Chinese in this area of Arizona. Also be sure to check out the ceiling inside AJK, its like staring at a night sky filled with blinking stars... pretty unique."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here several times and ate in the restaurant once. This is by far the best Chinese food in the area...Everything I've had is fresh and delicious. I usually go for the chicken and broccoli, and if you get it to go they'll give you enough food for 2 or 3 meals. I am still on a quest to find the perfect eggroll though...you know the big fluffy golden brown ones with pork and shrimp in them (I'm from NJ and that's what they're like there) and still no luck. But this place is a breath of fresh air considering the best Chinese food we had around here was Panda Express...and Chinese food shouldn't come from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I love AJK. Hands down my favorite spot for Chinese food. I like how when I order a shrimp dish they give me 12-13 pieces compared to other places that will give you maybe 5 or 6 and cut in half. Really good bang for your buck. I will say though I always used to order the Roast Duck and it seems like they changed the flavor or cook and it's just not the same anymore. They used to serve it in the sauce and now the sauce comes served on the side, just doesn't taste as flavorful. But aside from that, this will always be my go-to place!"}
{"text":"We have wasted so much money on chinese food in the valley!..grrrr. I read a review on yelp a couple weeks ago and have now eaten here twice!  The food is very good.  Im gluten intolerant and they do not hassle me when I ask for no soy sauce on my food.  They even said I can bring my own.  Im giving them a 4 because they do not offer gluten free breading or gluten free soy sauce for their meals.  The ambiance is elegant and traditional looking..very pretty.  They have bundle dinner specials, that is quite a savings.  You can also substitute the white rice for noodles or brown rice for a small fee.  I like that option because white rice is not the healthiest.  If you have been frustrated looking for good chinese food in the west valley..come on down folks!..You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Shitty the shrimp was so freaking thick with the batter from being fried and they don't put the cook the food with its sauce. Sooo gross yuck !!! Worst chow mien, I could've had a better dinner at panda."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and it was really quite good. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was that it was fairly modern and quite clean...Including the bathrooms.   The lunch specials are fairly priced. The soup was good, egg roll hot and crispy and the veggies crisp and fresh in the garlic shrimp entree. The fried rice was just OK.   Suggestion to the restaurant: serve the egg roll on a separate plate so it does not get soggy while touching or sitting in the sauce of the main dish.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's not better than SF China town but that's better than China itself!  Best I have had on the west side of Phoenix tho and much better than Panda Express!!!  Food served quickly and service is unparalleled!  I will be back but next time with my family!  So glad...  Phoenix seems to be devoid of good Chinese food!  FYI- food looks more greasy in photos than actually are!"}
{"text":"I love this place, as far as Chinese to go choices, or when I am in the neighborhood this is my spot. I love how amazing usually taste. I usually get the sesame chicken. It is so crispy, and the sauce is amazing. And when they have it, I'll get the duck. As far as duck goes this place a pretty good job preparing it. Duck is usually very greasy, but they do a pretty good job, not the best I have ever had but close to. The egg drop soup is the best I have ever had though. The only problem I have had is the service, could use some work. Waited like 15 minutes to get the check, had to make it known to the waitress."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We got the dinner for 3 but everything we had was lacking flavor and they were the chefs selections."}
{"text":"Just wasn't what I thought it would be.    Maybe it was just a bad day or maybe I selected the wrong entrée but unfortunately I did not like the food at AJK Chinese Cusine . The entrée's just weren't what I thought they would be.  The sesame chicken that we ordered was completely bland, the mongolian beef did not seem fresh, and the lo mein and fried rice were greasy and lacked any taste.   I honestly think you can get same or better quality food at Panda Express."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I have been eating here for a year now and are highly impressed. Not only do you get a lot of delicious food for your money, but the wait staff is so friendly. The restaurant is very calm inside, with relaxing music playing, very pretty lights over each table, two televisions, which are not loud, and a roof with lights inside little holes, to make it appear that stars are overhead. I strongly reccommend the Thai fried rice and the Beef Chow Fun. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is always great. The food is authentic and you get nice portions. The staff is very nice as well. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with my mom on a whim while out shopping. It's really unassuming looking outside, but the inside is nicely set up and pretty relaxing atmosphere.  They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc. I got the orange chicken combo and it was quite good, it was spicy and orangey and didn't taste quite the same as everyone elses' typical recipes. The egg drop soup was pretty good. I'll probably stop in here now when I go shopping."}
{"text":"We have been going to this establishment for quite some time and have been satisfied with the food. The portion are not the largest we have seems but the food is good. The place is not always busy so it is nice when you want to be able to have a conversation. I would recommend this restaurant if you are sick of the big chain restaurants. Shop local my friends and support the mom and pop places!"}
{"text":"I did not want to come here because the reviews were horrible but I decided to try it anyway and it was sooooooooooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday late afternoon.  Including us, there were only 6 customers.  The service was pretty quick (3 different servers), they all helped out each other.    Ok, here is the food comments:    Thai Satay Chicken Skewers - they were dry, tough, and not grilled (I think it was fried).  The peanut sauce that they were covered in was not peanutty enough.    BBQ Pork Slices - the flavor was good and a little greasy, but the slices were inconsistent.  You get super thin slices and they normal slices.  Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side.    We overhead the couple on the other side of us complain about their food.  So, I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food.  I would good back to Ono Hawaiian (fast food) which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian."}
{"text":"We have been there several times and love the food!  It's always fresh and hot and the service is great!  It's also very nice inside."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. They have the best fried rice and the prices are good. The staff was friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my take out order. I will go back."}
{"text":"Finally! A wonderful place to get great Chinese food! The service is excellent and the food is exceptional. I ordered the Cashew Chicken and my husband ordered the Orange Chicken and both plates were super tasty and generous. I can never finish mine and I take the rest home for the next day and it's wonderful, even then. The employees are always willing to adapt a recipe to your needs and serve it with a smile. I really love this place and try to go as often as I can."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with Debra. Two things in Phoenix have been disappointing  1. Chinese - learn to make crab Rangoon!! Not these disgusting cheese puffs!! 2. I thought Mexican food would be much better. Lived in Denver for two years before moving here, we have nothing on their Mexican food."}
{"text":"Really tasty and fair price with good size portions. Loved the Kung Pao Chicken and the Fried rice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly place to grab some good Asian food. The staff is friendly and fast price great and they have really good hit and sour soup."}
{"text":"Found this place on the fly while out running errands and starving.  Owners were nice, especially Husband..Very courteous.  Place was clean and we were offered water or a drink while waiting for our takeout. Food was very, very bland...very little flavor at all...  Kung Pow had what I considered too many bell peppers and wasn't spicy (hot) even after I asked if it would be spicy enough.   Cheese puffs bland.   Eggrolls Bland.  Portion sizes were Ok but sauces were much more runny than other places...and did I mention bland?  our search continues...."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go.  Chicken with vegetables, fried rice and spring roll.  Spring roll was the best part.  Chicken was blah, not many vegetables, and undercooked rice.  To top it off, they didn't include any utensils in to go order."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. As far as I'm concerned this is the best in the west valley. Generous portions and quality meats. The cheese puffs and spring rolls are crisp and very good, none of that haven't changed the dryer oil in 2 weeks taste.  Chai boba tea! Well it's awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love ajk, the food is always awesome. We recently celebrated my mom's birthday here since it's her favorite Chinese place. They had no problem seating 30(: they are friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because its close to home and I cant find a good Mongolian beef dish on the west side. It truly lacks the asian flavors! I called for pick up and whoever answered sounded like they didn't want to be there and I was bothering her.  ordered 2 entrees and 1 order of fried rice a total of almost $30 so not worth it.  i tried sharing with my roommates and they were not having it. I tossed it the day after, I just couldn't eat it. I'll keep looking for a chinese restaurant.."}
{"text":"Not the worst or something to go home ranting about (the best) I like their food, but I'm still looking for the home run in Chinese cuisine around my pad. We ordered the sweet and sour pork, and orange chicken with brown rice (a nice option). The portions were more than enough for two and I tore it up the next day at work. No one was in there when I came in, hopefully this place picks up because I hate seeing the small guys loose it in this big dog world. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and pretty cheaply priced for any type of Chinese food. I went here a few weeks ago on a date and loved the atmosphere, it was nice and quiet and wasn't insanely bright outside so it was a nice change from out doors. The only issue i had was that i waited like 15 minutes to pay for my food because the lady at the register was messing with the toothpick dispenser."}
{"text":"I'd have to say that I am definitely a fan of this place. Very small and kind of out of the way in the strip mall, but great nonetheless!   We got takeout here all the time after work. The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :)  We recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;)  Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though.  Oh, and the place is small, but very nice inside. Nice atmosphere... nothing spectacular, but it's comfortable and quiet. They also had 2 flat screen TVs that I saw, but I didn't really pay attention to what was on. Sports? idk."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian spot. The AJK Dinner is just the right size for my family of  3.5. I love the Orange Chicken & Mongolian Beef flavors although their Mongolian Beef is more onion than beef. The Milk Tea with boba is perfect every time!"}
{"text":"This used to be a nice place to eat in or carry out but food standards and quality have dropped like a stone. Our LAST meal was a carryout that simply consisted of Mei Fun and house fried rice - no taste with exception of curry powder.  Both dishes were substandard. They tasted as though they had been made a couple of days before. Really bad and a waste of money.  FOOLED US ONCE SHAME ON YOU FOOLED US TWICE SHAME ON US BAH BAH"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Not only is the food delicious but the service is everything that you could hope for! I love this restaurant and would recommend it to EVERYONE"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this establishment. Very friendly service. I got General Tso chicken. Supposed to be spicy but it was rather bland with no spice. Chicken was over fried as it was tough and dry. Fried rice was good but egg roll was evidently old because it was chewy rather than crisp. Likely won't be back which stinks because they are so close."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Server was just right, did not really have to ask for anything. Best part they serve boba!"}
{"text":"When your tired of eating at big chain restaurants such as Pf's, Pei Wei's ect.. Give this place a try. This establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste. Our favorite's are egg rolls & egg drop soup with hot tea. We've tried all their main entrées & they are all delightful. At the end you'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good spot to eat with your family. Good amount of food served. Good customer service, I have 2 or so years coming here since my boyfriend introduced me to it. Food has an amazing taste specially the Mongolian chicken that I recommend anybody to try."}
{"text":"We were there a couple months ago and had a pretty good experience. The place had only been opened for a few months and we didnt know about it until we got a coupon in the mail. We ordered several dishes including: duck fried rice, mongolian beef, kung pao fish, wonton soup and boba thai tea. The mongolian beef and fried rice were excellent, meanwhile the kung pao fish and wonton soup was a little bit over average. I guess we'd have to go back to try more dishes. Overall, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"We've tried their food at least half a dozen times and without fail it's been the best Asian food we've found in the valley.  Every dish has been great, the portions are HUGE (they give you your order in a cardboard box!) and the lady that works the front is a sweetheart.  I honestly can't come up with a single negative based on our experiences so far.  Two snaps up!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and the food was fantastic! Was greeted immediately and even asked if we needed an outlet to charge my phone."}
{"text":"Food is amazingly delicious!! Food is made really fast!! Place is very nice on the inside and staff very attentive. Everyone who goes to Panda should come give this place a try, you will love it. This place has high ratings for a reason!! Would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Great SERVICE!!! Food was delicious but came out very hot! Restaurant is very clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Good food, nice dining room, a little hard to find cause it's in a strip mall, but it next to the dollar store. Spring rolls have hint of cinnamon in them, not a fan of those, great Lo Mein though."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese rest. Very cost effective if you order take-out. Portions are good and great flavor. Staff is also great and your order generally comes out in a timely manner. Could use more dishes added to the menu."}
{"text":"OMG amazing! Love this place, always fresh food and the best spring rolls I've ever had in my life lol"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants, and this one was not impressive. They were cold but business friendly.  I asked about an ingredient and they would not add it for an extra cost.  Crab Rangoon is called a \"cheese puff\" and were ok.  Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients.  Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice.  I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place. Too bad because its nice inside and clean."}
{"text":"House rice was awesome. Full of meat chicken and shrimp. They def didn't skimp on the add ons"}
{"text":"I don't know how this gets great reviews. Maybe my expectations are to high. Maybe I Am used to good Chinese food coming from Seattle. This was totally bland. No flavor, nothing for me to recommend it. I'll pass on it next time and drive further."}
