{"text":"A fairly cheap option for food at Crossroads Market. Their breakfast is fairly cheap as long as you don't expect too much. It's your typical greasy diner breakfast. I found the burger lacking in terms of taste and appeal. The fries are nice, looks hand cut and quite crispy. The fish and chips are definitely a winner though. The cod was flaky and moist encased in a crispy batter. The fish and chips is also a pretty good deal too coming in under $10."}
{"text":"Roxy's Burger Bar is located in the Crossroads Farmer's Market, and I was moved to write a review on this little place, based on not only good quality food, but INCREDIBLE value.  My family was in town from Ontario and we took a trip to Crossroads, and I was immediately drawn to Roxy's because of their sign that offered \"Tim Horton's Coffee\" for an extra $0.30.  Whoo Hoo!!!  I was in like flint.  The staff there were extremely friendly and customer focused, and as I waited for my breakfast, I was ASTONISHED by the portion sizes that were being delivered to the people in front of me.  Absolustely astonished.  One customer ordered Poutine, which was served on easily a 10-12\" plate, and it was piled a good 4 inches high.  I actually laughed when I saw it, because I am convinced there would be leftovers if you were feeding a family of 4 (depending on the family, I suppose).  The omelettes were huge, the coffee was delicious and the service was efficient and quick.  This is a business that I will go out of my way to support in the Crossroads Market!"}
{"text":"Following an afternoon performance at the Loose Moose Theatre in the Crossroads Market and 3 kids in tow we needed some food.  After checking out our options in the food court area, 2 wanted burgers....so off to Roxy's I went.  Drinks, 2 burgers, small fries, BLT and a small poutine later we were ready to sit down and eat.  The fries were really tasty and there was a ton of them....so much so between 5 of us we couldn't finish all the fries bestowed to us.  I had the poutine and while it was large, it didn't exactly have a lot of flavour (besides the tasty fries)...the gravy and cheese curds were lacking.  The burgers were huge but again not super flavourful (stole a couple bites).  Hubs said the BLT was the same as a BLT we would make at home, simple.  Portions are large, cost is average, customer service was impeccable as everyone was very friendly but the food flavour kind of hit/miss.    They also serve Tim Horton's coffee for those TH coffee lovers out there.  We would try Roxy's again...but perhaps a different menu item to see if we have better luck with other food."}
