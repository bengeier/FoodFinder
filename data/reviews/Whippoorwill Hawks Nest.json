{"text":"Things have gotten much better there since my initial 2010 review,  I had a taco there the other night that was as big as my head! The bartender / owner has turned things around and made this a designation I prefer instead of avoid like 3 years ago. 

Nice turnaround!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite bar. Staff is very friendly, food is amazing and very welcoming. Favorite place of hometown families; you will probably see many generations of families here at once. The new jalape√±o poppers added to the menu are to die for. Friday fish fry's are best in the state. Strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Prime rib sandwich was out of this world. Classic Wisconsin bar, and the absolute cleanest bar I've ever been in. Great service and quality food. Very happy to see places like this still exist."}
{"text":"Great surprise! 
A real diamond in the rough. I was driving home in the vicinity and saw this place pop up on Google Maps and decided to dip in for dinner.

It was a week night and there was construction all around, only one or two cars stood in the gravel parking lot and to be honest it didn't look like much from the outside. I'm from Madison and felt like I probably wasn't the most traditional patron, and certainly not a regular. I was worried I'd be made to feel unwelcome and stick out like a sore thumb in this rural pub (as has been the case with a few others around Dane County I've been to), but wanted to give it a try nonetheless. 

As soon as I walked in though all my fears were alleviated. The interior was cozy, not rough, it feels much more like a supper club than a local dive (not that I don't enjoy dives on occasion). I sat at the bar (only one other customer was inside, also at the bar a little ways down). The amiable owner immediately made me feel at home. The food selection was impressive - I had delicious pork chops, the special of the day -, and the bottle and tap list was a pleasant surprise as well. They had a much larger selection than I anticipated, including a few craft brews on tap from the area like Lake Louie Warp Speed. 

I had a nice chat with the owner (whose son is the cook) throughout my meal. 

I was informed they have a meat raffle as well and I have been trying to spread the word to some friends who enjoy checking those out too.

I may have to plan a trip to Indian Lake Park this summer just so I have  an excuse to go back here afterwards."}
{"text":"Stopped in after cross country skiing at Indian Lake for a beer and burger. FANTASTIC bar burger and fries, done a perfect medium. Bacardi and a cheeseburger / fries ran around $10. The place is very clean, and friendly bartender. We'll definitely stop back again !"}
{"text":"The Whip rocks!  Yes, the most recent owners have really improved the quality of the food and maintenance of the bar and restaurant.  The food is excellent.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a dive.  This is not a 4 star restaurant so don't expect that type of food.  However, it is not a redneck or biker bar either.  The Friday night fish fry is worth the trip.  The breading is light and the fish is flavorful. The burgers are also very good, and the service is excellent.  The atmosphere is simple but clean.  On a weekend night all the locals gather to drink and eat.  It parallels a German pub being the social center of the area.  You can see 3-4 generations of the same family at the Whip at the same time.  So if you want to see the real Wisconsin rural pub seen, stop by for a beer and a tasty meal.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great fish fry with cod, walley, shrimp. The food is decent with a typical salad bar selection. Expect a long wait but with it."}
