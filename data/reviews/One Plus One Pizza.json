{"text":"Disclaimer: I live literally a block away so convenience is a factor. 

This is a standard, no frills pizza place...not Libretto. No thin-crust napolitano here. Competitors are pizza pizza, 2-4-1, etc. With that in mind, this place is a godsend when you need a cheap tasty meal without having to get out of your PJs. Pizzas are CHEAP (large 1 topping pick-up is like $7.99), their sauce is better than average for these types of places and they are very generous with the toppings. They don't seem to charge extra for toppings like feta, spinach, etc but their \"gourmet\" options aren't huge. Dipping sauces are average. Wings are fine flavour but tiny-neither here nor there really. Overall, my go-to spot for regular old pizza. Lunch special is med 1 topping for $4.99 so wait the 10 mins and avoid the not-so-fresh slices."}
{"text":"These 5 stars rating is laughable.Either they are the workers there  or have no taste buds at all.The so cheese is so thin you can see some of spots on the dole where it wasn't thick enough to cover,topping are cut so small so they make it look like its covering the whole pizza.For the area they are in their prices are on the high side,don't know why the interior looks like its from the 1970's and the workers seems to be wearing the same shirt the whole week.Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good - not too much sauce, lots of cheese, generous toppings, not too much crust.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just moved in around the corner. Super yummy,great prices.my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Good tasting pizza.  Great service.  Well recommended. Will go again. It is just down the street from my new place."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great and really cheap. Definitely my new go - to pizza joint and most definitely better than any of the major chains. I haven't had a chance to try the wings but next time I am definitely going to give them a go."}
{"text":"Wow. I am so happy we ordered our dinner here. 

We put in an order for pickup, one medium pizza with three toppings, 14 wings and three cans of pop for $21.45 taxes in. What a deal!! The order was ready in exactly 15 minutes and it was super hot. 

The pizza was fantastic! This isn't a fancy place. This isn't Neapolitan style gourmet pizza. This is old school Toronto pizza. The crust was soft and chewy and the toppings were fresh and tasty. They did give us sausage instead of bacon, but it was an improvement. I felt as though I was instantly transported back to the birthday parties of my youth, mowing down on this thing. The wings were also pretty tasty. We ordered hot and they had a decent amount of spice to them and maybe some bbq sauce as well? 

Their prices are really great for the amount and quality of the food you get. The Hubster got through his half of the medium pizza, while I was only able to finish two slices and some wings. That means that this order equals two meals for me (and two for the Hubster if he liked wings as much as I do). They have all sorts of combos and specials. They also offer free delivery, which means that they will be our number 1 choice for lazy Sundays.

The final test will be when I have the rest of my slices tonight, cold and in front of the TV. If they're still tasty, then we know we have a winner!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, good pizza, definitely my favorite pizza place! Try the bacon and corn one! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I eat here more than I care to admit because it's around the corner from home. The pizza is not stellar but it is your run of the mill pizza so it serves it's purpose. The reason this place scores major points is that it is dirt cheap. Two pepperoni or two cheese slices only set me back $3, add in a $1 canned drink and I can be full for lunch for $4 even. The biggest complaint I hear from friends is that the slices can be a little old. The trick is to order the one that looks fresh. If that fails, it's only like $4.99 for an entire medium pizza so there's always fresh and cheap grub if you shop smart. I'll continue to go here pretty much daily."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. I'm so glad we stumbled on it. Great prices and they do delivery!"}
{"text":"This place sucks for a pizza places. There wings are small with no meat
 Pizza had to much oil and feels like your going to have a heart attack.
I rather cross the street and go to dominos then eat from here again. 
Cheap food yes but the quality isn't there."}
{"text":"very good pizza and friendly customer service i always order pizza from this location its delicious way better then bigger brand names , thin crust with black , green olives , onion , mushrooms , sometime try with tomatoes mmmmmmmmmm im hungry lol ,"}
{"text":"This is possibly the best pizza I have ever had. When I want pizza I always come here. I recommend it my friends and family. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high reviews? If your goal is to get pop and dip, I may give it a 2. But, I order for the quality of food and the pizza and wings were subpar at best!"}
