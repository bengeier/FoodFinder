{"text":"I love this place just as good as the Florida location but the staff are nice and my only issue is that the staff are a bit under trained and when the wonton soup came to the table my waitress sort of acidentally got scolding hot soup on my arm(dont get me wrong the soup was awesome and so was all the food) but thats my only complaint. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Chronological sequence: We ordered a bowl of Hot & Sour soup...and they bring us a cup of it We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp & the Lettuce wraps as starters....and we had to remind them about the shrimps after our main course had arrived. There were 5 of us and when they eventually brought us our soup in a bowl...they roughy us 4 bowls ...then they fought us 4 plates when lunch was served....so we asked our waiter to bring another plate....which he forgot to do We ordered the Singapore noodles...but they thought we would like a garlic noodles better When charging the credit card the machine ran out paper....then when it was replenished...I was given my slip but not the credit card...had to remind him that maybe it would be a good idea to give it back About $50 was taken of our tab...but we did not go there for a discount...we went there to enjoy a meal....they did not get that"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and very large portions. Requested the spiciest of spices and they were spicy. Try the signature dishes. Great service!"}
{"text":"hideous does not even begin to describe the quality of the cuisine here. yeah, some people may have their gripes about service, but that is something that comes with practice. but with good food, it takes more than arm-twisting to deliver. i've lived in many cities before and nowhere is asian food deviates from the norm.  now, i dont mind if you play around with the ingredients - heck even make it more non-Chinese. but if you cannot get the basics right like ensuring your noodles are not soggy, your wonton skins are warm - it points to fundamental techniques that a $40/pax meal should command. No nein nada for me!"}
{"text":"Service - 5/5 Food - 3/5 Atmosphere - 5/5  P.F Chang's dishes didn't amaze me but the service and atmosphere did.   My boyfriend is allergic to peanuts which we forgot to mention when we ordered our food. So when our server brought our food, we asked if his dish contains any peanuts. The server ensured that the dish had no peanuts but the manager came over and told us that because some of their other dishes contains peanuts, the dish we ordered may be contaminated. Without our request, the manager told us that they will bring out new food for us. Even mine. WOW. Shortly after, they brought out fresh new dishes that they ensured were peanut-free.   Yep, their service was exceptional.   The food was pretty decent. I tried Crispy Honey Chicken with rice and Double Pan Fried Noodles. I still need to go back and try their Banana Spring Rolls. I know that some people would rather go to traditional Chinese restaurants but the price is reasonable ; you're paying for the outstanding service and atmosphere too.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at P.F Chang's. I hope their service remains exceptional :)   Note: Expect to wait for 30-40 minutes if you didn't make reservations. I went on a weekday and they gave me a pager. But no big deal - just walk around Don Mills Shoppe."}
{"text":"I want to first say that this places had been hyped up by my friend for the longest time. I've wanted to try PF especially because of it's location. I was not impressed.   Don't get me wrong, it has a wonderful setting and the environment is amazing. Service is nothing to complain about but it's the food that turned me off. It wasn't anything special. Practically no flavour at all. (Although portions are decently sized).   If only I could have the food you get at one of those run down Chinese joints."}
{"text":"Went in for a corporate lunch. We made a reservation a week beforehand for 12 people. When we arrived, it was 20 minutes before we even had a server greet us. She came over dropped off some sauces and left. Came back 5 minutes later for drink orders. Most people ordered simple drinks either pop, water or draft beer. Two people ordered something fancier - a mix drink from the menu and a specialty coffee. The pop/beer took another 15 minutes to arrive at our table. The coffee and mix drink was another 15 minutes after that.   The appetizers were decent, we had the northern style spare ribs (excellent), salt and pepper calamari (all breading, no calamari), dynamite shrimp (sauce had a nice flavour, would have been nice to have shrimp inside the batter), spring rolls were okay, and the lettuce wraps were average.   Once the meals started coming out, one of them was wrong and the server encouraged the person to just take it anyway (it's been over an hour since we ordered at this point). Most people were finishing by the time everybody had their food. It was probably a total of 30 minutes from the time the first dish came out till the last.   Overall the mains were mediocre at best. The service was terrible. I don't think anybody at our table got a refill. The place has been open for at least a month they should have most of the kinks worked out. It would even be somewhat acceptable if the place had at least been busy, but it wasn't. Most of the tables were empty.  Everybody that was with us agreed that they would be very unlikely to return, and if they did return it definitely would not be any time soon. I definitely don't think that this place will last. They certainly aren't doing the franchise name any favours."}
{"text":"I rate this place 3.5/5 overall!  Decided to give this place a try for our 7 n Half yrs together! The owners last name is actually spelled 'Chiang' so I dunno if its a type error for the restaurant...haha Came down on a cold rainy day around 3pm and it was not busy, so lucky for us.  My gf got the lunch special where you get choice of soup of egg drop or hot n sour with the entree which she got the Mongolian beef with scallion served with brown rice. Nice to have brown rice at a restaurant, as its a healthier option. The beef actually was cut nicely and tasted good, but the killer on the dish is the crazy amount of scallion. The soup she got was the egg drop, and the broth was actually nice and tasty, not too thick, and you can taste the egg drop in the soup. The soup is good.  I got the crab fried rice, because I love anything that is lobster, crab, or shrimp. The crab rice is complimented with asparagus, bacon, egg and shitake mushroom with zesty lemon and sriracha sauce. I thought the taste of the rice was pretty good and the portion size was good as well.  Got the shrimp dynamite as an appetizer and its served on a martini glass. The sauce is a bit spicy but its alright. The batter on the shrimp is a bit much for this dish, and I couldn't really taste the freshness of the shrimp as well. The sauce was a bit overkill for this dish.  Lastly, finished off with the 'Great Wall of Chocolate' which is a 6 layered chocolate frosted cake with semi-sweet chocolate chips accompanied with fresh berries and raspberry sauce surround the cake. This cake is quite BIG and would definitely feed 3 or more ppl for dessert. The cake was a bit dry for us, but we still managed to finish three quarters of it.  Total Damage: $58 before tax.  Service was good! Food was better than okay! Ambiance and Decor is nice! Would come back to try other stuff in the future!  P/S: They offer valet parking if you want rather than parking at the back area in case you enjoy that special treatment... =P"}
{"text":"I never knew about PF Chang until my date decided to take me there.  He loves PFChang apparently because he was in florida and loves the \"ChineseFood\".  How silly, I would rather do congee wong, however I gave it a try and keeping an oepn mind.  It is not that bad, I had the tofu and edamame, what I like is the option to choose brown rice as a healthier option via their menu.  By the way the Buddha stick sounds really awful, we didnt order it.  Deep fry green onion? Thats so cheap! I can just imagine the grease and soggy onion on the inside.   The atmosphere is perfect for a first date, trendy and quiet enough to carry a nice conversation.  Our waitress was super awesome, she keeps her eyes open and always refilled our water.  She comes around very often to check on our food and offered a quick run down of the dessert menu.  The lack of great food is replaced by the exceptional service in that place.  SO if you are running out of ideas and prefer good service over great food. This would be your place!"}
{"text":"5 stars Chinese Restaurant! Best I have ever tried. Simple as that. Amazing food, beautiful atmosphere and great service. I went on a double date and we ALL loved it. We highly recommend to try this place. We ordered the following: Dynamite Shrimp, Garlic Noodles, Sesame chicken, Korean bbq chicken, charcoal beef and black pepper beef. Wow was my expectations blown away. Every dish was delicious and clean and tasty. The Dynamite Shrimp and Charcoal Beef were the stars of the night. U must try these at least once. I have nothing but high praise for this special restaurent. 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's was a great experience having the honey shrimp and what an experience having the spring roll!  The service  was super great and the food was fabulous.  I love P.F. Chang's atmosphere...it was very pleasant.   I invite everyone to experience the honey shrimp because it was so good!"}
{"text":"Finally a PF Changs in TORONTO! Been to the one in vegas and the one in buffalo. My favorite asian restaurant has finally come to Toronto, ya I said that twice.  I give this one a 4 because we waited 2 hours for a table!!!!!! Ok I get it's not their fault that they are busy. However there were empty tables! The food was amazing lettuce wraps are a hit! Our server SUNNY was friendly and engaging. The manager kept coming to our table to ask how everything was. On one of the busiest night that really does WOW me. I highly recommend go during a down time to avoid the line up. Great place and great location"}
{"text":"We recently tried P.F Chang's for my cousins birthday and I believe they had only been open for a week at the time.  Making a reservation was easy and we were seated on time . The tables were rather small for the party we had and we were told that our tables should actually be holding more people ! The interior is well done otherwise and ambiance is good.  Onto the menu   Appetizers - Crab Wantons - good but pricey  Dynamite shrimp - average. Would not order again Calamari - below average. Avoid   Main dishes-  They encourage family style where everyone shares and that is what we chose to do. The food was satisfactory in terms of taste but nothing special. One of the dishes we specifically asked for no bacon but they didn't do so. They apologized with an order of honey chicken on the house which was nice though.  Desert - This was the best part of the meal and really well done. We had 4 orders of their fried banana/ice cream with fresh fruit and it tasted really good !   All in all I'd say its fairly expensive for what you get and you can do much better for how much you spend. Worth trying once if you're really interested."}
{"text":"for a walk in 4 we were Greeted quick, sat even quicker, and then ... 35 min of nothing no water servers running past us, had hope for this place but no way after that."}
{"text":"I'm gluten-free so I appreciate that they have an entire section in their menu dedicated to gluten-free. Their spicy chicken is particularly good and I love their sauces. I usually get take-out so it is a little pricey with entrees starting typically above $15 for not so large portions."}
{"text":"I've had PF Changs at Partridge Creek (MI) where it is top notch every time and Don Mills location rivalled that one. Everything came quick, was hot, flavourful and the portions are fairly big. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Knowing they would be busy I made an online reservation for Saturday night. This worked well and the table was ready when we arrived and we by-passed the twenty or so diners who were waiting for tables.  Service was unremarkable but no real excitement from the servers or forthcoming recommendations. I ordered a tofu dish and my friend ordered a lamb entrée, both of which arrived in about 10 minutes. My tofu dish was warm at best but tasty and I considered sending it back to get it heated up but generally I avoid sending food back.   I've been on a number of occasions to this location and had better experiences but it was just \"OK\" for a quick meal before a movie."}
{"text":"If I was craving Chinese food in Dallas I might consider PF or the mall. But in Toronto not a chance. In a city with dumpling shops and great dim sum where I can also chose Haka or Taiwanese or Shanghainese or just go to Congee Wong or Congee Queen I am left shaking my head."}
{"text":"Not sure what is happening with this place! I loved it down in Burbank California. Was so happy when it came here to Toronto. First 4 times it was exactly the same as down in Cali. Excellently prepared and fresh. Last 2 times( within the last 30 days) it was terrible! Dried out and salty and just sub par for what portrays itself as a fresh unique restaurant. I hope they get their act back together or they will be done soon!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight.  Had a very nice dinner. Shared egg rolls Lettuce wrap, Mongolian beef, spicy chicken, and chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was perfect.  Service was great.  We were pleased with everything."}
{"text":"Ok, so I do not understand the reviews at the bottom of the page with 5 stars, they must be employees or paid to give a 5 star review.  The best restaurant in Toronto as one 5 star review said, are you people kidding me? Best? Mc Donald's is better than this place.  Ok after my rant I am going to give a proper and fair review.  Here it goes:  We have been to PF many times in the US, the service there was good and staff knowledgeable.    Moving on to Canada.  Was cautiously optimistic about PF coming to Canada, as I knew that it wouldn't be the same.    We went there last night with 8pm reservations.  (3 of us) Got seated right away, good job PF off to a good start.  Next, took some time before we were offered drinks.  Placed our orders for appetizers, the spring rolls, shrimp dumplings and lettuce wraps.  All came except for the dumplings after we have finished all the other appetizers.  We ordered our mains which were Mongolian beef,  mango chicken, and mushu chicken.  This order was put it AT THE SAME TIME as the APPETIZERS.  Well guess what?  At almost 9 pm, over 45 min after the order was placed, our server comes by and says  \"oh I don't know what happened to your order I'll have to go and put a rush on it\" uhm ok are you kidding me?  So our food finally arrives around 9;15 pm.  Fine whatever, we were pissed but what are you going to do?  Then they mixed stuff up, it was ridiculous!!!!  After our dinner, she comes by to ask if we wanted dessert menus then comes back and puts the menus on the DIRTY TABLE!!!!  Is this normal? I am used to having the table wiped clean after a  meal even at a damn diner.  We had enough at this point and just got the bill and left to NEVER RETURN to this location.  Here is the biggest problem of all:  LACK OF TRAINING OF SERVICE STAFF  The most important part of any restaurant besides the food is SERVICE!  Why else would you chose to eat out?  Anyway enough with my rant but at least this is an HONEST review."}
{"text":"I give this place *** and a half stars.  Food-wise I would've rated it less, but my family really enjoyed themselves and our server (Sunny -- I think was his name) was simply great!   We ordered Chang's signature chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken noodle soup to start. The wraps were a hit with the everyone and our server brought us extra lettuce wraps without us having to request it. The soup was also great (served table-side) and definitely not your typical Lipton's chicken noodle soup.  The mains are where things started to fall apart (at least for me). We ordered the Chengdu Spiced Lamb, Beef Lo Mein, Shrimp with Walnuts and the Shrimp with Lobster sauce. The sodium content on each dish (except the shrimp/walnuts) was unbelievable. I couldn't taste any of the spices from the lamb marinade. The meat was wonderfully tender but just so salty. Same goes with the shrimp in lobster sauce. I could barely taste lobster.   Needless to say I drank a lot of water that night. I also don't think that the high price point ($19.99 for the shrimp dish) justifies the actual dishes we ordered. Luckily, my family isn't as critical as me when it comes to food. They enjoyed the lovely atmosphere, the friendly/helpful/patient waiter, and I can't deny the fact that we finished everything down to the two orders of Banana Springrolls we had for dessert (really good btw, but something I've easily made at home before and for way cheaper).  I wouldn't come here for authentic Chinese food to be honest, but I may consider bringing friends the next time for the atmosphere, the wide variety of Asian-influenced food and the great post-meal walk we can take around Shops at Don Mills."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but this was actually quite good.  Took my mom there for dinner mid-week, and she was thrilled.  It's kind of like a Keg with Asian food.  Wine list is divided by type of flavour.  Dishes are good for sharing, with a lot of choice.  Server was very attentive but not intrusive, and also very knowledgeable (we had a fairly detailed discussion about types of rice... I guess I was trying to show off for my mom:) You're not going to be surprised or Wow-ed by anything here, but also not disappointed by anything."}
{"text":"The place looks great. Service is great. However, prices are ridiculously higher than the states for less amounts of food. Also 2 out of 5 dishes were so salty. The egg-rolls were barely edible due to salt. The mongolian beef dish was so salty too, but we were able to get through to that. The banana rolls dessert was so good. I would go back to this place again, and see if they can perhaps go easier on the salting."}
{"text":"Normally we eat at authentic Chinese restaurants, but came here to entertain my senior parents and the place is wheelchair accessible. We have eaten at PF Chang's in the States a couple of times, and, the food was pretty good for what it is.  Not so at this location.  The prices are 20% higher than the already high prices in the U.S.  The food was a huge disappointment.  Small portions for the price and terrible food.  It was no better than much cheaper food court Chinese.  Save your money and the costly disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm not changing the star rating but wanted to update the dish selection.  If you are going to eat here with the expectation of authentic Chinese, go across the street to Congee Queen.  They are cheaper and have more surly staff.  PF Chang's is about the Asian American experience.  The chicken lettuce wraps are much better.  Going with a table of 6 we ended up ordering two orders of this appetizer as everyone enjoyed this and wanted seconds.  Of course after waiting an hour at the bar, we were quite hungry.  The second dish of note was the 5 spice duck.  That was actually a hit with my much travelled Chinese father who ended up barehanding the duck leg and cleaning all the meat from its bone.  He thought the duck was quite succulent.  I enjoyed the ease in only eating the breast and leg.  The cherry spice sauce was well received as well from my Chinese mother who thought the rest of the meals were over-sauced even though we asked for them to reduce all of the sauces since the birthday boy (13 yo) really didn't like any sauce in his meal.  I would definitely skip the fried crab wontons next time.  Not great, actually not even good.  And the two noodle dishes we ordered were disappointing - Shrimp Lo Mein and Chicken double fried noodles.  For real double fried noodles go to an authentic Chinese restaurant.  But since this was for a birthday outing of a boy who doesn't enjoy authentic Chinese food, this Pan Asian experience met the mark, even with an hour and 15 wait.  They told us it would be an hour and half to 45 min, but I think they were being conservative and we noted the table we were eventually sat at was empty for a good 15 minutes before we were led there.  The boy said \"it was well worth the wait\", so I believe him."}
{"text":"Visiting from the States, and PF Chang's is usually our go to restaurant and thus we thought we'd try it here. Came in on a slow afternoon with my family. First off, the manager (asian lady) who also served as a hostess, as no host/ess was to be found  was one of the most unpleasant and unfriendly managers I'd ever seen in my life, but not just with our family it seemed. Would it hurt to crack a smile or just slip in a \"hello\" rather than rolling your eyes and slamming the menu's down?  On to the food: the dumplings were cold and had a sour taste to them, and the fried rice was also cold and had a very weird smell to it. It just seemed as if nobody cared what they were putting out. I knew something was up when the table in front of us had their food sent back as well. The chicken dish we ordered had pieces that were awkardly cut and the sauce was just piled on into a gloopy looking mess, and the Singapore street noodles which is one of our favorite dishes was also terribly done. No heart or feeling went into the making of any of the dishes.   All in all, a highly unprofessional environment. The waiters are at the bar watching tv in the front while customers are waiting for their food, the manager is parading around with a sour mood, and one of the chef's is reading a newspaper in the back. It hurts me to say this, but, this was a terrible experience, and not what we come to expect from our favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Asian fusion kitchen with great taste friendly staff and cosy atmosphere recommended on the week days where less crowded"}
{"text":"We went to PF Chang on a Saturday as it was the only place we could get into immediately rather than a 40 minute wait elsewhere at The Shops at Don Mills. The staff are excellent and the decor is quite good. They completely fall apart with the for which is just barely OK. It is very family friendly and dishes are shared and my family liked it so in that sense it was a win. Just don't go for anything approaching real Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is far from being Chinese, but we came for tasty no matter what. We had Buddha sticks which were basically a green onion tempura. Unusual choice of vegetable but an amazing tempura.  Both entries were steaming hot and flavourful. The ones we tried were red shrimp chilli and coconut curry chicken. And the most not Chinese thing: cheesecake New York was just amazing. I can return here only for the cheesecake!  And yes, service is great, interiors are trendy, music not too loud. Nice."}
{"text":"If you're coming to PF Chang's for good Chinese food, skip this restaurant and start driving north to Richmond HIll / Markham. We ordered the Singapore Noodles, Cantonese-Style Duck (peking duck) and a small plate of Asparagus. The best part of the meal was the side plate of asparagus. The other two were not very appealing. The \"pancakes\" that came with the peking duck dish was basically a piece of Indian roti cut into 4 slices. Don't get me wrong, I love roti. But I don't want roti with peking duck. I want small, thin pancakes. The duck was very tender, but still disappointing. The Singapore noodles were completely drenched in sauce and was way too heavy.  Can't complain too much about the prices, as I knew what to expect before I went into the restaurant. The reason I'm never returning to PF Chang's isn't because of the prices, its because the food sucks."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and location are great, but the food not so much. I didn't expect the taste to be anything \"authentic\" but it didn't even taste good in an Americanized way. Presentation was quite poor as well and portion size was below average. Not worth it for the price you're paying."}
{"text":"I had heard the hoopla over PF Changs and decided to try it out myself.  I really liked it.  It's basically the Canadian fast food concept of Chinese food, but elevated so that it's tasty, not greasy.  I really like the lettuce wraps. Every dish we had was something I'd order again. A little expensive, but I'll wager that the food will be consistent from visit to visit.  I'll pay a little extra for a (rated by me) guaranteed 4-star meal. The service was very nice - attentive, but not cloying. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I was a little excited about PF Chang's coming to Toronto as I frequently went to the LA locations and always seemed to have great food and service.  Ths PF Chang's here however is a bit different.  Let's start with the valet drivers.  They were pretty rude in taking my friends car keys and didn't even look at him when they peeled away in his car.  They also mentioned a mandatory tip when we went to pick it up.  No big deal, let's talk about the service.  It was packed and hard to get a seat, even though we made reservations in advance.  We were seated about 20 minutes after getting there and our table was super big for a party of only 6 people.  Our waitress wasn't very attentive and it took a while to get anyone's attention for drinks and napkins.   The food tasted a lot different than what I was used to in LA.  Not sure if the ingredients or produce were different, but everything seemed to taste super sweet and laced with sugar.  Shrimp with pecan and melon, fried rice and the salmon were just a few of the things we ordered and everything was either too salty or too sweet.    Overall for the price you can have an epic meal at a top of the line Chinese restaurant in Markam or Richmond Hill.  With all the competition out there I can't really see this place staying afloat for long."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice ambience, meh food.  My friend and I ordered off the fixed price menu, which was a good value ($25 each for 4 courses). The waitress we had was polite and friendly. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour - tasted like the cooks dropped a bottle of soy sauce or hoisin sauce into the pot. The steamed shrimp dumplings were the highlight of the meal for me, nice and flavourful. The 2 mains we got - korean BBQ chicken and spicy shrimp with noodles - both had a nice spice kick to them but were overall very forgettable. I can't exactly pinpoint what I didn't like about the dishes - my friend argued that the food was too \"americanized\", which is possible - but all I know is that it made me miss the corner of Spadina and Dundas."}
{"text":"Came for the opening night with some work colleagues. PFC fills that gap for Chinese-inspired food with a bit of a more decadent kick. I love Toronto's authentic Chinese, but having come from Montreal I sometimes crave something a bit more deep fried, a bit sweeter. PF Chang's does this. The table apps were spare ribs (sweet gooey with 5-spice flavour), lettuce wraps and dumplings. All were good, but I liked the ribs the best. Mains were duck (breast and leg), orange beef, caramel mango chicken, shrimp with lobster sauce and PFC fried rice. Again, everything we good and flavourful. The Orange beef was different from what I'm used to, even in the Montreal Szechuan realm. It was cubed, coated and more \"orange\" than I've had before. The shrimp/lobster was a good choice.  Service was great as everyone on opening night was busting their butts to do a great job.  No one will accuse PFC of being overly authentic, but that's not the purpose. If you want something that tastes good with a strong Chinese influence, this is a fine pick.  I struggle between 3 and 4 stars. I think 3 because it's not something I'd eat on a regular basis, but also consider 4 because it does a good job at what it's trying to do. I'll go for the latter, as it's a fairer assessment of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had made reservations 3 days in advance for a Thursday night dinner with 6 friends of mine.  About half an hour before we were all on our way to try this new restaurant in the heart of the Shops at Don Mills, I decided to call the restaurant to see if we could get seating outside on the patio, as it was a beautiful warm night (one of the lasts of summer).  TO MY SURPRISE, the airhead on the other end of the phone just happened to inform me that the restaurant was CLOSED due to a power outage, and that their kitchen was out of service.  YES, I understand unforeseen circumstances, but when I asked her WHY she hadn't called me prior, she said \"Oh, we must have accidentally SKIPPED your name on the reservation list\".  Not only was I furious, because I had 6 other girls with me, this was 15 mins before our reservation (mind you, she kept screwing up my reservation time on the phone- I had to call back to rectify things and was put on hold for 30 mins) and we were lost as to where else to eat.  The manager got on the phone (his name is DAN), and kept apologizing.  He really seemed like he cared, sounded pretty genuine and sincere, until he promised to send me a GIFT VOUCHER in the mail, and lo and behold, 3 weeks later I am still SANS gift voucher, and just really really pissed off.  These people think they can take advantage of customers, because they're a new and expensive restaurant from the US, but they all seriously need a fresh lesson in customer service.  I called the restaurant, spoke to Dan, 2 weeks after he promised me the gift voucher, told me he was SICK the day he promised to mail it out, so I gave him my address/contact info once again.  Yup, a week later, without the gift voucher.  Called him again today, he told me he THOUGHT I was going to come into the restaurant to pick it up.  Why don't you lie a little more through your teeth, Dan?  When I said I would be in later tonight to pick up the voucher, he expressed that he wouldn't be working tonight.  JUST BAFFLED!"}
{"text":"I was overly excited about Toronto's own PF Chang's but was left a little disappointed by the incredibly bland dishes. Wish I had've stuck to the appetizers. The Lettuce wraps were decent and the Dynamite Shrimp was pretty tasty, a little too greasy. I can't remember what was ordered for the entree, which is a pretty bad sign...   I thought their little production when mixing the \"Chang Sauce\" and creating the doggie bags was pretty entertaining -if not a wee bit pretentious though."}
{"text":"PF Chang's is alright--just alright. I've been here a few times and it's an interesting environment. The food is really good while you're eating it and they've made a good brand for themselves. Most of the time service is above-par.   I would imagine it would be a great place to go to with your family, but ultimately I can't get over how their food makes me feel.   The funny part is I'm not one to ever complain of a food sensitivity or be affected in the stomach, but there's just something about this food, perhaps that it's so salty and deep-fried that really has me feeling sluggish at the least after a meal here.  It also feels a little assembly-line and artificial."}
{"text":"I've always thought there was a market for upscale faux (errr inspired by) Chinese cuisine in Toronto.  Essentially I classify it as Carb+Rice or Noodle+High Sodium Sauce stir-fried dishes.    I mean it's ok, and as a fast food thing sure, but as a sit down pay over $10 a plate place?  Well the service better be darn awesome.  Luckily for PF's that's what they capitalize on.. Servers who come around and explain the crap out of everything.  Make dipping sauce table side.  Smile at you.  Maybe even give you a belly rub if you asked (not sure, because I didn't).  The three other things they've done to up the margins is create a clean modern decor set up, have a western albeit small dessert menu and cater very well to Gluten Free diets.  They even carry gluten free soy sauce.  So.... overall it was a fine experience, but can't say I was blown away by anything specific.    There is a market for PFs in Toronto.. it's just I'm not in that market.  For 1/4 of the price, I'd do Congee Queen (or any of the other Congee places) any day of the week.  Sure there's less smiles from the server, but there's better and greater selection of food options there, and no smile is worth probably $15 a person."}
{"text":"PF Chang's gets my award for WORSE RESTAURANT OF 2014. Which is saying a lot if you read my review on kintori yakitori.   My first time here a few months ago we were seated in the lounge and the server was coughing like crazy! As she was talking to us and when she'd walk from the tables to the kitchen were constant phlegm filled coughs that filled the restaurant. She sounded like she needed to go to the hospital. My gf and I left immediately.   Second visit started out fine, no coughing by servers, and our server was very nice. But this is where the joy ends.   The food for the most part is ATROCIOUS. We had the \"dine for two\" deal so we had a wide taste of what they have to offer.   Vegetable soup/chicken lettuce wrap- these were actually decent, but I don't think this soup exists in chinese cuisine. and the chicken lettuce wrap was served with vulgar sauces on the side that didn't go with the wrap. This unhealthy focus on sauce would prove fatal for the rest of the meal, as most of the dishes were drowned in way too much sauce.   chang's chicken and mongolian beef- apparently the house specialities and their most popular dishes. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? they are literally the worse single dish I have had since I can remember. Chang's chicken commits the worst sin possible by using that crappy presidents choice sweet and sour sauce you can buy by the jar. And they drown the chicken bits in the sauce essentially turning them in to candy. It reminds me of the \"plum sauce\" children get with their chicken fingers at a 1990's golden griddle. I ALWAYS finish eating what i am served, but for the first time since I was born I was forced to stop half way. This dish was that bad.   mongolian beef- i will concede that they did cook the beef nicely, but again put WAY TOO MUCH salty soy sauce . more water was drank than beef in order to get the beef down. and why on earth would you serve beef with so much green onion? for 18 bucks lets get some real vegetables in here!  both the chicken and the beef were also of unacceptable sizes for the price. huge rip off.   after realizing that this was going to be the most americanized chinese meal of my life i thought they couldn't possibly mess up dessert. we got cheesecake and red velvet cake... the most american dessert possible. and yet they disappoint. the cheese cake tasted like it was prepared by children using an \"easy-bake\" oven from the 90's. and the red velvet was just a freakish amount of icing.   This restaurant is an insult to chinese cuisine, and represents everything that is wrong with american diets. Too much sauce, salt, sugar, and not enough veggies.   CONCLUSION: -dont' come here unless you want diabetes, or hypertension -if you want \"exotic\" food try \"linda modern thai\" around the corner from this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a Chinese food version of cheesecake factory.  If you give this restaurant a 4-5 stars, this must be your first time having Chinese food.  Okay, they have this Big fancy horses on the outside and decent interior decor.  The food  was under average (Just nicely plated Mandarin buffet food).    In a city like Toronto, this restaurants really need to improve their food standard to survive here.  I would much rather go to spring roll, Mandarin buffet or china buffet king if I want Caucasian style Chinese food and pay 2/3 of what I paid at P F Chang.  And if I want nice atmosphere and pay the same, I would much rather go to spice route on King west."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a table of 3 the night before the actual day, and when I got to the restaurant I had to wait a few minutes.  No problem.    When the hostess brought me to my table, it was a small square table in the middle of the restaurant.  This would be a table that I would expect if I didn't call to make reservations a day before.  Immediately I told the hostess that I made reservations and I don't want a middle table.  I was meeting with some clients, and we had some transactions that needed to be made and I didn't want the whole restaurant to see what was going on.  The hostess talked into his little microphone and then gave me a booth table near the corner of the restaurant.  Excellent.  The waitress soon came, and took our drinks order.  She named all the beer's on tap, and was quite knowledgable.  I decided to rest easy, and ordered a Nestea softdrink.  I arrived with one other person, and we were waiting for our third and final guest to arrive.  We enjoyed our drinks while we waited, and on the drinks menu, there was no mention of free refills of my soft drinks.  I drank and finished most of it, and to my surprise the waitress came back with a new one.  Free of charge.  Great!    While we waited, we ordered some appetizers, the Tuna Tataki Crisp, and the Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wrap.  Our order came very quickly, and there was no issues at all.  Food tasted good, and we were satisfied.  Once our final guest arrived, we proceeded to order our mains.  The waitress did some mixing of soy sauce which I forgot what was what, and what she mixed, but that's fine.    We ordered a PF Chang's fried rice, Mongolian Beef, and a vegetable dish which I forgot what it was called.  Items came however for my taste it was a bit salty.  Once the bill came, it was a bit expensive, and I was a bit surprised for the items ordered.  Perhaps this is because I'm chinese and I'm not used to paying so much for such simple chinese foods.    I've never been to a PF Chang's before, and I've seen/heard of this chain whenever I vacationed in the USA.  This location here in my neighbourhood is a welcome site, but I will probably continue to go to my traditional Chinese restaurants from now on and perhaps save PF Chang's for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My nostalgia from living in the US - I always and will always have a place in my heart for PF Chang's.  I would definitely recommend some dishes.  CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS - yum!  Ask them for the extra hoison sauce, it's delicious as you wrap the lettuce in the delicious chicken mince mix.  I compare all of my lettuce wraps to this one - it's quite delectable.   The AHI CRISP was delicious, I don't normally like deep fried food, but the raw fish on it was a good balance.    Love the DUMPLINGS, they are a bit small but they are quite the appetite openers.  Aren't the best dumplings but they are quite tasty and would recommend.    WOK-CHARRED BEEF - it was tasty but there was a lot of celery, I was wondering for a hot second where the beef was.  MUSHU PORK - loved this as well.  Can't go wrong, it's a salty dish, I really do like the fact they offered to wrap it for you.    My absolute favourite is the SPICY GREEN BEANS, this was absolutely divine, it's a bit salty but I am partial to green beans.  It had great flavour and tastes great with noodles or rice.  They get the points off in service, should be consistent and it never it.  I had a business lunch there and it took almost 2 hours and the waitress was flustered.  Yuck.  Overall, I love PF Chang's, I feel like for a chain restaurant, they do a great job making some legit asian food."}
{"text":"I love eating at P.F. Chang's whenever we visit the States.  The food is consistently excellent in taste and quality... ambiance and decor is nice.  I was excited to discover that one had opened here at The Shops at Don Mills!  It was just as delicious although service this time was mediocre.  Curious to see how well the restaurant does in Toronto though because we have lots of great asian restaurants here.  The novelty is lacking when eating at a P.F. Chang's in Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing service , food , all good ! Beautiful looking decor.  So happy they came to Canada.  Hopefully the Cheesecake Factory will soon follow.   P.S.  The Banana spring Roll dessert is to die for !!!"}
{"text":"My pal treated me to dinner the other night. It was really crowded for a Friday night so I would recommend making a reservation. That being said, sans reservation, the pal and I waited for 10 minutes. The ambiance is great, service was pretty good. The food ? Remember the Manchu Woks in the mall food court? It reminds me of that, but just a little better. Anyway, the menu is large enough for everyone to enjoy. It's a little expensive, but I enjoyed the experience as a whole.  Good for: American-Chinese Food"}
{"text":"I was brought here by friends who raved about how great the food was. It's ok, but Toronto is practically the Mecca of Asian food in North America, and PF Chang can't compare.  Prices were high for the small amount of food you get which as every Chinese person knows, is a big no no lol.   We ordered lettuce wraps, but they came out extremely burnt. It was changed right away, but it still had a slight burnt taste. We also had coconut curry vegetables which was pretty good, if simple. A beef dish that was utterly forgettable, and lastly banana spring rolls that sounded better than it tasted.  The one thing I really enjoyed was the coconut lime sour, which I will definitely make for myself at home.   Service was pretty decent, our waitress was attentive and quite friendly. Atmosphere is a little too dark for my taste, but so is every other place at Shops on Don Mills.   All in all, I doubt I'll come back here, since I can get better food at similar price points (and more plentiful dishes) in plenty of other places."}
{"text":"Service: Quick & Courteous  Food: Bland & Average (examples including Lemongrass Chicken Salad, Lemon Brocolli Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup)  Total bill in my group of 3: $80  Bottom line: Great service does not compensate for the high price of the middling food."}
{"text":"LOVE P.F. Chang's!  Was always a favourite place to go to in the US so was very excited when it was announced they were coming to Canada.  The best way to describe P.F. Chang's is that it is a great Chinese restaurant with a Keg-like atmosphere.  I normally get the pan-fried pork dumplings, sweet n sour pork, fried rice and the szechuan beef.  Wonton soup, orange-peel beef, dynamite shrimp also very good.  Great service, atmosphere and food... can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely. The service is fast, friendly and professional. The price is right and the beer is ice cold. Unfortunately thats about all the positive comments I could come up with. We started with a cold appetizer of cucumbers in soya and sesame...pretty good. Then came our honey shrimp and Dan Dan noodles. Both were tasteless, mushy and swimming in goop. The mini carrot cake dessert, however, was excellent. In a city with chinese food that compares with San Francisco and Vancouver as the best in North America this place is a poor excuse. We've been to P F Changs in Florida and Arizona with pretty much the same experience but we were hoping for better in Toronto. Three strikes and you're OUT."}
{"text":"LMAO~! For those who can't handle authentic chinese food, this is your place.  Think of it as a westernized, over priced, upscale dining experience.  I've been to PF Changs before, but it was in Dubai, at the Dubai Mall.  Their ambience, decor, and service is very tres tres efficient.  The food? well based on the taste, presentation, and overall metrics, I would have to give it a 3.5/5 However I do recommend for starters their Buddah Sticks, lightly fried onions with a spicy mayonnaise dip which was a creative idea. 4.5/5 I ended up having their Caramel Orange Chicken, spicy, yet sweet! good balance of flavors. 3.5/5 Coconut vegetables: variety of veggies mixed in with the inhouse coconut curry sauce 3/5  Overall the experience is a 4/5 but again the food is the main issue here!!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake. This place is all about outward appearance and not so much on inner appearance.  The gf and I decided to try this place out after shopping at Shops at Don Mills one night. Joeys was packed and long wait, Bier Market was too loud for our liking at the moment, and having been to Glow a few times, we wanted to try something different. Kind of a spur of the moment thing.  Ordered gyoza/dumplings to start, tuna tartare to share, and fried rice with crab for main.   Gyoza was average, tasted like something homemade. We 've had better elsewhere, it was very soft on the outside, only slightly seared at the top. Filling was ok too, nothing outstanding or anything. I could detect a hint of fried egg, perhaps they greased it with a cooked egg before.  The tuna tartare was bland, served on top of a crispy chip with diced cucumbers stacked neatly on top. They generously drizzled it with spicy mustard even though I explicitly asked for no spicy mustard as my gf cannot eat anything spicy.  Nevertheless, it was bland and the tuna pieces were cold as ice, most likely frozen and defrosted as there was no flavor to it.  Lastly, our main course was the fried rice with crab. The rice grains were soft, more akin to steamed rice and lightly fried for like 10 seconds or something. It fell apart the moment you put your utensils into it. Maybe it was microwaved which would explain the wet rice taste. Crab pieces were generously mixed but tasted very bland (hmm, recurring theme here) and lacked imagination of what true fried rice is all about.  For $18 a plate for this dish, you expect more as how can anyone really screw up fried rice. There was also heavy use of black pepper and siracha which to my taste buds could not detect but my gf did. Needless to say, she dind't eat much of it even though our waitress had assured it she would tell the kitchen that no hot sauce would be used.  What a disappointing experience. Ambience is nice, but that's it. Do ask for dining room seating as we were seated on the covered but heated patio which had an open end \"window\" which did not sufficiently blocked the cold. (This was back in early March.)  I would definitely not return to PF Chang's. I would recommend you take your money and go to Congee Queen across the street for a more delightful Chinese food experience."}
{"text":"Well....I was excited because a) this is at the \"oh you fancy huh?\" shops at Don Mills and b) they look really nice inside and outside.  However, I was seriously disappointed with the food. My work buddies and I came here after Spirales. There were 10 of us and we could only get a seat on the heated \"patio\" (it's closed off so not windy or anything). IT WAS SO FRIGGIN HOT ON THIS PATIO!!! They have the heat cranked up super high on those lamps, i think if I got any closer to the lamp my hair would just go up in flames.   Second problem - it's too expensive. Plain and simple, for what you get here you are overpaying by a least 20-30%. The lunch potions are cheaper (around 15 dollars with tax) but you get a small serving of soup, plain white rice (booooring) and a mediocre serving of meat. Therefore, I opted out for the spring rolls. Two spring rolls cost me $5 and Abbas will vouch that I NEVER CARE ABOUT PRICES IF THE FOOD IS WORTH IT! In this case, i think going to Man Chu Wok would have been better and more efficient, in every sense.   The service was nice, but nothing to remember...we all got our water pretty quick and got in and out of the restaurant in a little over an hour.   The give you condiments - hot mustard, soya, white vinegar, oil and chili paste (smells like sriracha, but a little chunkier).   My friend's food didn't taste that amazing either, actually looked exactly like mall food. He ordered Chang's spicy chicken, it came with soup and plain white rice. Portion was small, not enough chicken.   NOT impressed with my experience here at all. I'll only go back if someone wants to pay for me to try eeeeverything, in large quantities (hint hint) hehehe..."}
{"text":"It closed in July. My philosophy is that if you cannot praise someone who passed away, then shut up. I hope some of the other eating establishments in Shops of Don Mills are getting worried whose turn will be next."}
{"text":"No it's not authentic Chinese food....but yes it's tasty! Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, crispy honey shrimp, salt and pepper prawns, pork lo mein...all good baby. That is, if you're a fan of \"Canadianized Chinese\" food. (If you want authentic, head to the suburbs or Chinatown).  One thing I probably wouldn't recommend is the hot and sour soup, but all of the dishes above hit the spot.  Overall, we enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend and ordered from the P.F. Chang's for Two menu for $29.99 each. This included a bowl of soup for each person, one starter to share, two main course dishes to share and two mini desserts.   For the starter we ordered Chang's Famous Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were very delicious and not over seasoned. The thin rice puffs that came with the dish added a nice crunch. For our soup choice, we both ordered the Hot & Sour soup which had a very thick consistency and tasted really salty. For our mains we ordered Wok-Charred Beef and Mongolian Beef. We should have ordered a beef and a chicken dish because the beef dishes tasted almost exactly the same. Both dishes were good, but we found them to be extremely salty. For dessert we ordered Creamy Cheesecake Mini and Red Velvet Mini. The mini cakes were presented in small shot glass cups and were very delicious.   I would probably come back for their Chicken Lettuce Wraps and maybe try a different dish, but definitely ask them to tone it down on the salt."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at the difference in quality from the American locations to this one.   That being said it is a really nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Before plunging into my review, I would say up front that I agree that PF Chang's is a Chinese-American dining experience.  There are so many other places in Toronto to get authentic Chinese food (ie Markham or Chinatown @ Spadina/Dundas)  Having said this, you can have some really food here, and the food quality is very good.  So -- what we enjoy here: APPETIZERS - chinese lettuce wraps - crispy green beans - they have a new app on the menu - pork, chicken or shrimp dumplings (aka potstickers) -- we had the pork and they were great!!  MAINS - the shrimp in lobster sauce is great! - try the cantonese duck --- so moist and the sauce is omg sooooo good - asian grilled salmon  You get your mains with white or brown rice -- nice to have the choice!  You can get a number of different teas -- my hubby likes the jasmine but personally I go with the oolong every time!  It comes in cast iron teapots which keep it nice and hot. They bring over a condiment tray in the beginning, but if you don't like spicy food -- suggest you stop them from mixing it up -- they always add chilis!  Decor is upscale and they have a large patio. They have valet parking for $3 or you can park in the lot near the LCBO."}
{"text":"Chinese version of Cheesecake factory.   Came here with a friend on a Thursday night at 7:30pm and was told it was a 45 mins  wait. My friend had walked by at 6pm to try to make a reservation in person but they said they wouldn't take it.  We wind up sitting at the bar to bypass the wait, as they serve the full menu at the bar as well.  Nothing crazy different on the menu but the bartenders were really nice as we had sat there for over 2 hours.  We had ordered the crispy green beans which was really tasty. Ma Pao Tofu which was weird that it was crispy tofu served on top of a bed of broccoli. Vegetarian fried rice, ok but also served with a lot of broccoli.  Will be back to try some of their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"First timers to PF Changs and we loved it.  there were 7 of us and we were lucky to get a round table with the big lazy susan.....wish all the tables had one.  We wanted to make this a great experience for our out of town guests and did not know what to order.  Both our waitress and one of the Managers named Sean made this easy through his very informed description of the items and getting to know what we liked as a group.  We ordered two soups Wonton and the Hot Sour both bowls and it was more than enough to feed all of us a couple of times.  We of course had the famous chicken lettuce wraps - loved the way they do the sauces on the table for it.  It was enough for each of us to have 1 wrap and they needed to bring a few more lettuce but were glad to do so.   we also had the Salt and Pepper Calamari - excellent  The entrees we ordered were:  Changs Spicy Chicken Mongolian Beef kung Pao Shrimp Lo Mein Combo  I would say the dishes were excellent in flavour and the they were distinctly different from each other and mixed well.  I will say that they are not HUGE portions.  We also had a kids menu which we had to ask for as our daughter - not a big fan of all the dishes.  But at least they had one.  Great atmosphere - super location - and free valet parking - bonus as the parking is not great at Shops at don mills.  we will definitely go again."}
{"text":"PF Chang's - they've finally expanded to Toronto.  I've gone on multiple occasions to both lunch and dinner.    LUNCH:  There's a fair amount of people but you don't usually have to wait for seating.  I tasted the following during lunch:   a) Honey Lemon Chicken: Excellent until I realized that the plate contains over 1000 calories for one lunch portion.    b) Moo Goo Gai Pan: It was edible but at times, I felt that some of the chicken tasted sour.  I don't know if it's supposed to be part of the flavour or if it was just ill-prepared.  Needless to say, I think it was just part of the flavour because I was fine later in the afternoon.   DINNER:  There were a LOT of people on the Saturday night I went and I waited 1.5 hours.  Totally not worth the wait.  My friend and I ordered some noodles (that were supposed to be crispy) and ended up tasting stale.  We had to send that back and got a lo mein instead - which was OK.  I got a Dali chicken and that is on a 8/10 spice scale.  It was OK but not the greatest.  Everything was super mediocre that night and definitely not worth the 90 minute wait.   Honestly, a lot of PF Chang's are located in the boonies in the States where there isn't a lot of Chinese food accessible.  We in Toronto, are filled with authentic Chinese food, for a much cheaper price.  PF Chang's is not the real deal.  It's fancied up fake Chinese food presented in a nicer way than your average fake Chinese takeout and maybe tastes a little better.  The two stars are for ambiance - the decor is great but the place was really quite loud on that Saturday night.  I don't know if it's because it's new or if it's because it was a Saturday night - it's just not worth the hype.  You're better off going to Linda Modern Thai for Asian cuisine.  They are down to earth, love their job, and take pride in their food - unlike PF Chang's - which is pretty much the McD's of the fake Asian food world."}
{"text":"Okay PF you have the big horses outside, trendy decor inside, and a great location! What else you got? Not Chinese food, or if we are going to call it that ... not very good Chinese food. I don't think you could get away with a PF in Richmond Hill so I guess the location helps. I was here in the summer with friends and it was very busy! Lots of new customers, lively environment, friendly service but that's it. I like food, good food, so no I will not be coming back to what is to me a glorified Manchu WOK. Enjoy your fortune cookies!!!"}
{"text":"Best I'd give this place is a 3*. Everything was SOOO salty. Note to P.F.Chang..back off the salt!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say, the gigantic \"bingmayong\" type of horses in their front entrance had us fooled!   NO STARS for the food, ONE STAR for the waiters because they really tried.   And the waiters weren't even all that great - I can sense their nervousness:  first from them trying to explain to us their \"house\" pot stickers sauce, which was this:  PURE WHITE vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil.   We just knew the outcome was not going to be good, when she mixed the yellow wasabi sauce, with soy sauce, and chili sauce.   Not only did it looked gross, it tasted like I could do this at home, but I won't because if I wanted wasibi soy sauce, I would have ordered sushi!   And plus, our potstickers came with the plum sauce already, so I didn't get point of this (but then I realized, all the other tables had it) And I guess this is equal to \"BREAD\" being served at anon-Chinese restaurant.   (I would have preferred the bread).  And you wont' believe this, she told us, if you want to bring the spiciness down, just add the white vinegar.  LOLz....  I am use to the yellow or red vinegars we eat at Ding Tai Fung - I could have sworn, it was just the regular vinegar you get at Loblaws!    I don't blame them, I guess PF Chang needs to live up to their grand ambiance, so they have to play a little show for us     Anyhow, I ordered the EGG DROP soup to start  and boy, TNT Grocery Store makes better take-out egg drop soup than them.  I am under the suspicion that the brown pieces were not eggs, but dried chinese bean curds, that looked like eggs, LOLzz.... seriously!!!!  For our starters, we had the Crab Wontons.   It was the worse I have ever eaten in my life - mayo MUSHED CHEESED-flavoured crab meat (I didn't see any bell peppers) and the bottom was soggy, but the top was crispy.   It was soooooo gross.   Their plum sauce was disgusting too!   Tasted like the Y&Y ones you get at Loblaws!   McDonald's have better plum sauce!    On to the main, Dan Dan noodles.  Waiter put on another show, it was not a big plate, but anyway, he pulled out a portable table, and introduced the mediocre presented dish to us and said, I will mix it for you guys now and also cut the noodles for you, because he said \"noodles symbolized long life and I don't want you guys to be cutting your own noodles.\"    He was kind of also trembling a bit when he was explaining this to us because I guess he realized he must looked really silly saying this to us.   haha...   Come on now, we Chinese people do not need to cut our noodles into little pieces.  On top of that, the noodles were not spongy, but soggy.   Asian Legend had better Dan Dan  noodles that didn't cost me $12.99!!!  And for $12.99, the  plate size would have been doubled at Congee Time!  LOLz....    Ok... enough bashing.   I lived in the States for a good number of years and trust me, US lacks GOOD Chinese cuisine.   My Chinese friend who lives in California came to Toronto to visit and even thinks Toronto has one of the best Chinese cuisine around for being in North America.   PF Chang's will be crushed by them like A LITTLE ANT in Toronto for sure.  hahaha...    I want to end with this note that my husband, normally is not a picky eater, but he is a Native Chinese, so I would have thought it would be normal for him to think it's bad, but me, a CBC Chinese equally thought it was horrible.  So, believe me, it's BAAAADDDD!  Like one of the commentaries down there stated,  PF stands for PURE FAKE!  I totally agree!    I am totally baffled by some of the 5 stars given here.   But it seems like the 1-2 stars outbeat the 5's, so I guess I am not totally crazy."}
{"text":"I always seem to get dragged to PF Changs in the States by people who hate Chinese food, but LOVE! PF Changs. Now, I've been dragged here in Toronto.   Simply put, an even more Americanized (Canadianized?) version of the already Americanized Chinese food available in typical Chinese restaurants. Nothing tastes right. That's not to say it doesn't have a good taste on its own, but it doesn't taste like Chinese food at all. Atmosphere is fantastic. Energy of a bustling bistro. Food of Chilli's or Friday's off of their \"Asian Inspired\" menu. Don't be fooled and taken in by the trappings! With all of the fantastic Asian Food in this town, you can do better...much.  If you think Manchu Wok in the mall is great, this will blow you away. It seems to attract Prom dates down in the States.  FYI, this is one of those places where the appetizers are better than the mains, so if you must go just pig out on the apps and your experience will be a bit more tolerable."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Only disappointment was that they ran out of the 'Great Wall of Chocolate' and red velvet desserts! Oh well - I'll try them next time! Indicates how busy they are. Must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Notes from my 3rd visit to pf changs...  Seated as soon as we walk in at 9:50... so far so good... there were multiple empty tables around yet our greeter decided to sit us in the corner at a table that was not clean.  Drink platter sitting on the bench, someone elses dinner experience still on the table.   After the greeter failed to realize that we were less then impressed with the table, I had to ask for the table to be re cleaned.  Looked at the menu, decided which food would be devoured, looked at the drink menu and decided what drink would fit our food and then proceeded to wait.  And wait... and continue to wait as others were served, and we were left on our own.  Finally a server came around and cracked an joke about \"saving the day\" to take our order after 20 minuets.  I think she could tell we were unimpressed.  The food came, and in typical PF Chang's style it was delicious.  By the time I looked up, our half of the restaurant was empty and some of the staff was busy counting tips and cleaning around us.  It was now 11 pm.  Something seemed wrong about this in general.  Not sure if it was the counting of tips while i was enjoying some Mongolian Beef or the another server walking by saying \"I quit\" (albeit sarcastically) That was more disturbing.  It goes to show that the lack of attention that the staff now currently employed here has.  Finally, being given the bill without asking for it and asked to pay as we were 20 minutes from closing was the final straw.   Overall the food is still as good as ever but the service seems to have fallen off quite a bit."}
{"text":"I was introduced to PF Chang's in Boston by a fan, and it was great!  When I found out there was a Toronto location, I decided I had to give it a try.  I must say, the atmosphere is consistent from the US to Canada, but the staff are not nearly as attentive.  The waiter was not overly helpful when my friend asked for help in choosing a meal.  He was not overly on the ball when it came to taking our order or giving us information on the gluten free items.  Our appetizer arrived very quickly and the taste was on point.  When our mains came (PF Chang is a \"family style\" dining experience, large plates that you share), our Mongolian Beef was more green onion then beef.  I've never seen that many \"accents\" in my life.  A friend of mine who came with us noted that she was surprised by this as well.  The location is slightly hard to find as it's not advertised on the main plaza sign, and is located in the middle of a \"US Open Market\" style mall.    If you're looking to try something fun and new, I would suggest hitting up PF Chang's and digging in to the Mongolian Beef (tell them to go easy on the onions), the Honey Chicken and the Lettuce Wraps."}
{"text":"Every time I go its consistently good. The waiters are always very friendly and the food is wayyyyy better then any other chinese food your going to find in Toronto. Not even Pearl near Harbour Front can contend. Highly recommend the Singapore noodles..... Amazing... And the mini tiramisu is so good."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 8. It was crazy packed. You will definitely need reservations or good luck finding a seat. I give this place a 3/5. It definitely has potential to be better though. They definitely need to increase the food quality. I felt overall, everything else was great (service, atmosphere) but some of the dishes were just average.  PF Chang's is more fusion. It's what the Chinese like to call \"tricking the western\" Chinese food ...pay almost double the price of a reg Chinese dish but w/ nicer decor.   I ordered the crab fried rice. The rice was ok... but to me it was too dry and not enough spice or smth. It was definitely lacking. We also had the sesame chicken but it seemed dry. Maybe all the dishes were dry.... Portions were somewhat generous. The appetizers were good however (Tuna tataki crisp, seared ahi tuna). Would be back for get togethers."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit PF Changs in Canada because I have loved the times I have been to one in the US (read: every time I go to the states, the first thing I do is find the nearest PF Changs).  First things first - if you are looking for true Asian food, you will not find it here. It is Asian fusion at best. But still so delish!   Anyways, I was disappointed to see that not only was the food significantly more expensive but the portions were also much smaller and there were no special deals as there are in the US. At both the PF Changs in Chicago and NYC we were able to get 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 dessert for $39.95. Add drinks and the bill was maybe $50. At this location, for the same order of food and drinks we paid around $120, plus the portions were tiny (I can almost never finish my meal, but I finished soup, appetizer and entree here)   I should mention, one of the reasons this is one of my fave restaurants is because they have an entire gluten free menu which has most of the dishes on the regular menu - and they have their own gfree soy sauce!   Anyways, the food was pretty close in taste but I think I'll stick to my US PF Chang visits to keep my love alive and my wallet a bit fuller."}
{"text":"If you are expecting the American PF Chang's, keep on moving. Lot's of the menu is missing, and prices are much more. The food taste is similar though, 1 star for that, the other star is for the nice setting.  Some staff is very friendly, some is very blah."}
{"text":"Just way too expensive for nothing special. Why people come here to spend $50 on Americanized Chinese food is beyond me. I can get way better food, and better value from just about any place in Markham."}
{"text":"You all know what the PF stands for?  Pure Fake... Went here a few weeks ago with some friends knowing beforehand it would be a bad to mediocre experience at best.  I had  been to one in Cali and Buffalo in years past and this location is no exception to the lousy food.  About the only thing they got right is the location, far enough away from most Chinese restaurants to pull the wool over predominantly non-Asian cuisine goers. Remember folks, Congee Queen sucks too but is just around the corner and I would eat there before going back to Pure Fake.  Not sure why people are giving this place such high ratings but I feel compelled to draft this review to set the record straight.  Enough bashing... Decor is cheesy and just like the other locations. Service was a little hectic and illogical but I write that off to growing pains as it was the first few days after they opened.  We ordered chicken lettuce wraps... Not authentic and tasted funny as chicken is no substitute for Peking Duck. The Beef with broccoli was a large portion and was ok. Moo shoo (we opted for Chicken again - not my choice, blame the Gringos with me) and was horribly insipid, messy and soggy.  We ordered other stuff but again not worth mentioning.  You know what they say, there's a sucker born every minute. With all the Chinese restaurants in Toronto, why would you opt to eat here? It's not cheap by any stretch comparatively given the competition for Asian cuisine in Toronto."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience.  I came here with 3 girlfriends last Thursday night.  The ambiance was nice but the drinks tasted watered down and both the drinks and the food were overpriced.  The service was, for the most part, distracted (our server would disappear for long periods of time).    We ordered:  Tuna Tataki Crisps - they were good but I've had much more flavorful ahi tuna appetizers.  Salt and Pepper Calamari - this lightly battered and perfectly cooked dish was very tasty and the dipping sauce was excellent.  At $7.45 it is good value.    Crispy Green Beans - the benefit of ordering veggies is negated by the fact that they are deep-fried.    These were ok.  I could have done without them.    Sesame Chicken - I enjoyed this dish.  It was very flavorful.    Beef Á LA SICHUAN - I was looking for a crispy beef dish similar to my favorite at Schezuan Gourmet) but this was disappointing.  The dish had an aftertaste that I did not enjoy.     The server higher recommended the shrimp with candied walnuts but this was my least favorite dish.  It was an odd combination of flavors and was not presented in an appetizing way (see picture). The dish comes in a milky-white creamy sauce.  The walnuts were not candied - just coated in the sauce.  The honeydew melon balls were warm from the sauce and didn't seem to fit in the dish.    Overall the food left a lot to be desired.  I do not see myself rushing back to this establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take my mother in law here for dinner Monday night.  Definitely over rated.  What's the hype for?!  It's a nice place to dine but that's it.  Service was good.  Food was OK at best.  Paid $65 for chicken, beef and rice dish, taxes and generous tip included.  We wished we went to the run down chinese restaurant in Scarborough instead, where food has taste and the price is right."}
{"text":"I know PF Chang isn't the most authentic place, and my Chinese friends won't be happy with my rating. However, it's got a good upscale ambience, decent service and a few dishes that I dig.  We always get the same thing, here and in the US, and it's exactly the same. The chicken lettuce rolls, with their delicious mixed dipping sauce, chicken in black bean sauce and special fried rice. These things are really quite tasty, and make the dinner out worth it. Especially when we just want to dine out in a nice place with tasty food.  I tried their red velvet mini dessert and the icing was terrible. Tasted more like butter than cream cheese. Then again, I didn't really come here for dessert, and I'm going to stay away from that red velvet the next time.  This is more expensive than it's US version, but this is Canada and prices in general are higher (sigh).  I'd go back once in a while."}
{"text":"Fancy decor with fast food quality Chinese food sums it up!"}
{"text":"OK so it's Canadianized Chinese.  I was actually expecting a little more.  Food for the most part is ok but nothing spectacular.  I had the Chinese Eggplant and Lemon Chicken.  Eggplant probably only needed half the amount of sauce on it.  And could have used more Broccoli on the chicken.  The broccoli on the dish reminded me more of a garnish than actual meal.  I would however avoid the Panna Cotta on their spring menu.  Basil was not a good idea.  And my friend warned me ahead of time not to get the Dam Dam Noodles."}
{"text":"PF Chang has now filed for bankruptcy in Canada.  I hate to say it, but \"I told you so\".   Bad management, letting the wrong staff members go like Cedric and Matt were the ingredients in the eventual state that PF Chang finds itself in today."}
{"text":"Definitely a western approach to Chinese,  would much rather go to a Asian buffet where the food is quality and taste is mediocre but could stuff my face until I get kicked out.  The food is overpriced and way too salty in my opinion.  The food reminds me of a frozen microwave dinner or something out of a box.  I will admit that the spring/ egg rolls where very good probably the only thing going for them along with the decor and atmosphere.  I always recommend trying things once to form your own opinion but don't get your hopes up.  Better off having a blind Jamaican woman make your dinner at least you can blame her visual impairment if the food is saltier then a bag of layz chips."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday, my friend and I were seated right away. We decided to do the \"for two\" menu which is about $30 per person.   For soup we both got the Chang's Veggie Soup, the soup was okay but I'm not a soup person to begin with. For starters we had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. It was really tasty especially with the sauce that the waiter brought to our table.  For mains, we had the Kung Pao Chicken and the Sesame Chicken, each served with a bowl of rice. The chicken was tender and seasoned very well. Lastly, we chose the Chocolate moose and the Creamy Cheesecake. Personally, the desserts were too small for me lol. However, if you just need something a bit sweet but not too sweet, these desserts are perfect!   Our total bill came up to ~$80 which included 2 (alcoholic) drinks. I was a bit surprised but the drinks are a bit pricey. I would come back here for a special occasions and with a larger group of people since the food is served family style."}
{"text":"Not even the wonderful, professional staff, great service, nice decor and the fact that I was dining in a private curtained space with 6 charming women all of who were adding \"in bed\" to the end of their fortune cookie fortunes when reading them could save the evening from the truly awful food.    This is not Chinese food, but rather tastes more like something that some foodservice distributor unload in giant pales that is later plopped out into a fryer or directly onto a serving dish...nuff said. No need to torture you all with details.  For lots of folks this is as exotic and different as they will ever stretch themselves to experience so for that customer, PFC's fills a niche.    The only reason I didn't give one star was because the servers were very nice and did a great job, and... my fortune read \"All of you dreams will come true\" to which the ladies added \"in bed\"!  Unfortunately none of them was a twin! :-D"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere.   only comment is that the staff sometimes seem a little bit slow so you need to wait."}
{"text":"So excited that P.F. Chang's has finally arrived in Canada let alone in our home town Toronto! My sister and I happily came in for Lunch today.   The decor here is immaculate,hardly provoking any essence of a typical Chinese Restaurant. From the giant golden horses greeting you on the exterior, you walk into a modern loungey looking restaurant with hues of neutrals and earthy tones, hardwood, giant circular lights weave on the ceiling, and windows boarder the perimeter of the restaurant plus they even have a patio to dine on!  We are kindly greeted by two hostesses upon entering and taken to a spacious and comfy booth towards the back on the restaurant. Our waiter Sonny warmly goes over the menus, providing recommendations on favorite dishes and took our drink orders.  He later returns with our Green Tea in a beautiful black Cast Iron pot and two tiny tea cups. He brings out the condiments and kindly mixes together some of the sauces to create a custom concoction that he says will compliment our appetizer well.   Onto The Food...  Pan Fried Pork Dumpling - Handmade and prepared fresh from the kitchen Plump juicy ball of pork wrapped in a golden brown chewy skin is delicious and flawless.  Monday to Friday they offer lunch combos until 4pm which include a smaller portion of a meat dish served with steamed rice and choice of soup so we decided to take advantage of this special.  Hot & Sour Soup - Chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms balanced with hot white pepper & vinegar Rich broth, good balance of hot & sour, nice chunks of meat and crunch from bamboo shoots  Chang's Spicy Chicken - Tender, diced chicken breast lightly dusted & stir fried in a tangy sauce of sweet & spice Little kick of heat but perfectly balanced with the sweet glaze was a delectable combination  From the Regular Menu  Crab Fried Rice - Wok Fried rice with lump crab meat, shitake mushrooms, asparagus, egg, smoky bacon, zesty lemon, & Sriarcha Loved the visible chunks of crab meat and diced bacon, great flavour and I enjoyed the pieces of asparagus tossed throughout the rice, large portion  Orange Peel Beef - Sichuan-Style flank steak tossed with a mild chili sauce and fresh orange peel  I love me some orange flavoured beef and this was no exception! Perfect sweet citrus flavour from the orange with tiny bits of real orange peel countered with the slight heat from the chilies. Definitely my favourite dish served!  This is also served with your choice of brown or white steamed rice. I stayed traditional and went with White which was cooked perfectly.  Finally for Dessert, I couldn't resist it, as a die hard chocolate lover I had to get there signature chocolate cake!  The Great Wall of Chocolate - Six rich layers of frosted chocolate cake topped with semi-sweet chocolate chips, served w/ fresh berries & raspberry sauce I totally get why they call this the The Great Wall, it is truly the Mother of all chocolate cakes! It is a GIANT slice of cake!! I am thankful that they serve it with a knife so we could cut off what we were going to eat. It's soo rich and fudgey and quite possibly the moistest chocolate cake I've ever had! The exterior frosting is dotted with mini chocolate chips and slice sits a tangy raspberry sauce which compliments the rich chocolate cake wonderfully. Mmmmmmmmmm!  Overall Mr.Chang definitely fits the bill. They balance of flavours and textures in all there dishes were more than satisfying. Food came out hot, fresh, and delicious. Our wonderful waiter Sonny was attentive, funny, and charming providing exceptional service. He was always on top of keeping our glasses full and refilling our teapot and even packed up all our leftovers for us! Definitely check out Chang's!"}
