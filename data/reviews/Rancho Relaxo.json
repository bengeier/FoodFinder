{"text":"Well we just went back to the new Rancho Relaxo. The place is so different from the old, even the staff. The food was ok, smaller sizes and little more cost. The vibe from the old is gone, and I think so are we. Just not a place for us."}
{"text":"I went on one of those dailyteamfinddealbuy things, and my friend and I each got a dish called the Three Amigos.  It was a chicken enchilada, a steak taco and a potato cheese flauta.  They messed up her order a bit (She asked for no sour cream, but it ended up drizzled on something), but the server took it back immediately and had it made fresh (and pretty quickly) for her.  It was a delicious meal, and our server was very attentive and got everything for us quickly.  I'll go again for sure."}
{"text":"The best Tex-Mex I've had in Toronto so far.  Service is a bit slow, but the amazing margaritas (I don't think I've ever had a better one), and the deep fried ice cream make the trip worth it!"}
{"text":"We've always had good experiences here when ordering vegan meals. The service isn't super speedy, but everyone has been friendly, and there's a nice laid back atmosphere.   It's white rice, white flour, processed faux meats and cheeses, etc., so it's not where I go when craving a healthy or authentic Mexican dining experience, but sometimes it really hits the spot. It's definitely comfort food. I recommend the Three Amigos, vegan style."}
{"text":"For me, Rancho Relaxo combines the best of both worlds: delicious vegan options in the restaurant downstairs, and excellent live music in the venue upstairs.   After making the transition from a happy meat eater to an even happier vegan, I was afraid that some of my going-out favourites, burritos!, would be too expensive or difficult to come by, but Rancho has relieved all of those fears. The staff is friendly, prompt and knowledgeable about the selections and substitutions, and even better, the food is affordable!   Upstairs, well. I won't lie, the live music venue is on the smaller side and on hot summer nights the AC can be hard pressed to catch up. That said, there is no better place to catch a live show. The staff behind Rancho's venue are in it for the love of music, and there's no better place to catch a variety of local and touring indie bands from atmospheric pop to math core experimentals with glockenspiels. And if you don't like the music, hang out at the bar where the TV is and see what VHS movie theme the droll bartenders have selected for that evening's viewing. I have seen The Last Unicorn, a Dennis Rodman action flick, and other classics while enjoying a cold beer."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time post-renovation.    We all had tacos, which are small but incorporate lovely combinations of subtle flavour and are well-presented.  The churros are also amazing and the service was very good.  Looking forward to going back and trying some other things.    Not the place if you want a huge plate of enchiladas and refried beans, but definitely a winner for more sophisticated palates."}
{"text":"Wedding Catering Beware! I called Rancho Relaxo today to follow up on correspondence for my friend's wedding that had fallen off. We were very anxious to move forward and pay for the service but were not getting any replies past the first couple of emails so today I called and was told to speak with Donnie. When I finally got him on the phone to ask for menu details, pricing and payment he told me 'he didn't like my attitude and that I should take my business elsewhere' when I said 'I'm just trying to pay you I'm not sure where this is coming from' he said 'you're crazy if you think I can feed people for that budget!'  I have never had such horrible customer service in all my life! Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"A lot of people hate on Rancho and their food but why?  The food is solid, they cater to vegetarians with a number of really good veg meat options.  The drinks are fantastic and the prices are totally reasonable.  Let's not forget the service is good too.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Food's great; service is good. Nice, cozy place and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I walked in and had to seat myself.  For 10 minutes no one came to me. Not a word. I drank the water and left.  Wasted my time."}
{"text":"This review is for the \"gourmet\" food truck service that was parked at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre and operated by the same restaurant .   We were there for a comedy show and there were limited food options.  Only thing that stood out was Rancho Relaxo and we waited 45 minutes in line because it was so busy there.  Not the food truck's fault but the venue, because they do not advertise that the main stage show only started after 7pm and people were there since 4pm!!  Without re-entry to the Amphitheatre and with hours to bypass time, we stood in line to purchase what we thought was the best food option:  Rancho Relaxo.  It was that or pizza pizza, hotdogs...etc.   It was $10 for 1x  burrito, or 3 tacos, or quesadillas.  We ordered the chicken burritos, and it was tasty.    I would like to try it at the restaurant and  enjoy my food in a more relaxing environment next time.  The server/order taker inside the truck was extremely friendly.  Awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"You've been out for afternoon pints on the patio and now it's just after six and you need to get some Mexican in ya to get o to the second, night round.     But you don't want the real stuff do ya? You want to greasy spoon Tex Mex stuff that sits like a brick in your stomach till you drink it out with the next round of brewski's. Lucky for you Rancho Relxo is here to help.  It ain't the best, but it sure hits the spot when you need it."}
{"text":"Prices went up a bit and the portions shrank. While the newly rennovated space looks beautiful and more upscale, I'm really bummed that a lot of the vegan options disappeared."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have an extensive selection for vegans, and their food is as close to authentic as Mexican food in Toronto gets. They also have vegan fried ice cream, and it is SOOOOOO good! I find myself craving it more often than I would like! The service is also VERY friendly! On one occasion that my boyfriend and I went, the server had overheard that my boyfriend really wanted to try cactus, and the server came back with some cactus for him to try free of charge! The only reason I am not giving them a 5/5 is a very finicky one. I have a strong sensitivity to bell peppers, which makes eating Mexican food rather difficult. On busy days, Rancho Relaxo pre-prepares their food mixtures, which means there are not many options for me. If I go on less busy days they are very accommodating and will make my order without bell peppers. I almost feel guilty giving them a 4/5 because I know how great they are, but a 5/5 needs to go to a place that I think it perfect!  If you like Mexican food, you should check this place out. If you are vegan/vegetarian, then you definitely need to give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my visits there, until they revamped the menu. There weren't the same vegan options as before."}
{"text":"I seem to always end up here with my fellow veggies because it's in the annex, has vegan options, is open late and can accommodate large groups. But honestly I'd really rather not go there and definitely try to sway people to go somewhere else when meeting for food.  To start with, the salsa and chips they give you at your table - nice to have a free starter, but there is very little and the salsa has no flavour and is super watery and the chips are pretty gross and flavourless as well.  The service really kind of sucks. Even when there are few other people in the restaurant they're super slow and always seem grumpy and unfriendly. And if there's a large group? Forget it - bring a puppet show or commit to writing a movie script, you are not getting your food for a LONG time. They do have a good grasp on which items are gluten-free and vegan though, so that's a plus.  Most of the items on the menu can be veganized, which is awesome. But all the menu items are pretty much the same AND they charge $1.50 on top of their already high prices to do so. You definitely do NOT get value at this restaurant - their prices are ridiculous for what you get. For two super small enchiladas with only veggies inside and some gross refried beans, I paid $15 BEFORE tip. SERIOUSLY?? WHO are you kidding??? If it was $8 for that meal, that would be MUCH more realistic and appropriate given what you're getting. The fajitas come with very few tortilla wraps that always run out before the fillings are done - and then they charge you if you want more! And when two of my friends ordered fajitas, they got the same amount of fillings (lettuce, cheese, guac, salsa) as when just ONE of my friends ordered it - so you get SUPER ripped off if there are two of you getting the fajitas at a table.  If you're gluten-free as well as vegan, there aren't many options - either the tostados or the veggie enchilada (all the faux meats are gluten) - both of which are super over priced and really not very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I bought two Dealfind vouchers for this restaurant, and had a terrible experience at the establishment when we tried to treat some very important colleagues out to dinner.   We were seated for more than half an hour before the servers finally took our order. After we placed our order, we had to wait for more than a whole hour before the food had finally arrived. And when the food had finally gotten there, they had gotten our orders wrong, so we had to wait another half hour before we could properly start our meal.   The servers were also very rude. We had to flag a waitress down to finally be served, and she behaved very passive aggressively towards us. And when we sent our orders back to be corrected, they reacted very defensively. It was very unprofessional of them.   My wife and I have not returned to this restaurant ever since, and we did not even consider gifting the second voucher to a friend because we would never recommend it to anybody. We have since received a full refund for both vouchers from Dealfind."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, nice decor and atmosphere. The food was pretty good and really fresh, hot! They give you some tasty chips with salsa to snack on while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"This review is only for the upper music venue.  Ok, so being a punk for about 20 years means I've been to some pretty divey bars and when my friends band played Rancho I headed over. I'd actually never been there in 20 years of shows.  I was not impressed, not at all. -There was a cockroach in the washroom, a big one. I mean, how do you squash that sh!t while you're hovering over the toilet?  -My pop tasted like soap, watered down soap, yes, it was only $2.00 or so, but it was disgusting.  -There was a leak in the ceiling dripping into a big old rubbermaid bin right behind the sound table. ........Table, sound table, not even some spray painted cardboard around it to make a boothy thingy. It wasn't raining that night, where was the water coming from?"}
{"text":"I've been loving this place for years!  The food is amazing, the prices are really reasonable, and the environment really chill (in a good way).  I also love coming here to support the owner, a really great Toronto guy who spends his vacations helping build schools in villages in Mexico...!  Yes, I've been here when the service has been less-than-stellar, but the fantastic fajitas are worth every second you spend waiting for a refill on your beer.  Rancho Relaxo, ole!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with a group and once with just a friend, and each time I left underwhelmed.   I loved their decor and atmosphere and the service was friendly and quickly BUT, unfortunately, the drinks and food didn't satisfy. Not only were the drinks expensive, but were also quite weak; more tequila please! The enchiladas I ordered were ehh.. They had no flavour! Me and my friends found the food to be mediocre. Did appreciate the salsa & chips to start though.   One redeeming factor of rancho relaxo? Their ice-cream!!"}
{"text":"New and improved!  My previous visit to Rancho Relaxo was pre-renovation. Upon coming back, my first question for the gentleman who seated us was \"Did you guys used to be located a few doors down?\" The place looks SO different! \"No,\" he replied, \"we just renovated.\"  It looks fantastic! Elegant, clean, and a bit artsy.  The menu has been completely revamped too. It's not your typical Tijuana cantina fare any longer. They've gone upscale. And it's working. The dishes show the creative flair of a chef who aims to please. And the food is delicious.  There are several options for vegans (including vegan cheese, vegan rice, and vegan beans). And for those with celiac disease, the kitchen has a separate deep fryer that's kept gluten-free. (This means you can eat the chips without fearing cross-contamination.) So let your server know your constraints, and you'll be catered to quite nicely.  We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating available. It filled up later on. I think once the word gets out that Rancho Relaxo is all grown up, it will get tougher and tougher to get a table. So try it out sooner rather than later. I know I'll be back as soon as I can.."}
{"text":"Went there last night with a Living Social voucher and had a nice time. You definitely feel like you are dining in Mexico. From the décor to the music to the menu, it is everything you are looking for in an authentic Mexican restaurant. The queso is really delicious but was very small. My boyfriend had the chimichanga and loved it I had the fish tacos, they were ok, a bit on the greasy side and had a lot of batter. I really liked the rice and salad that came with it. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was delicious. The best part was the dessert, the Sopie which is banana ice cream with honey and Khalua served with fried chips and cinnamon. What a heavenly dish! It was pretty big I was really impressed. The service was great, very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. If you are looking for a nice place to get together with friends at good prices this is a great place to go to!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. The ambiance has a nice Mexican feel to it.   The Manager was very nice in helping us decide what to get. We started with 2 drinks not on the menu per her suggestion. The cosmorita was quite well made. The other drink was ok- don't recall what it was.  For starters, we got the sizzling calamari which was good. For the main course we got the fish tacos and the tinga quesadilla. The fish tacos are a must order here. The service is quite slow considering that there weren't too many people there. We closed our meal with an order of the sopapillas which was a nice touch. Deep fried sweet tortilla chips with banana Icecream. Just get it!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Thursday night with a group of 9 people for a friends birthday.  it wasn't really busy so we didnt feel rushed to make an order.  The server was really relaxed with our large group 9 (as it increased to 12) and kept the drinks flowing. When we eventually ordered, the food came pretty quickly, I ordered the steak enchilada which was just the right size (not to large or small portions) . for drinks I had the Sangria which was quite strong, but still easy to drinks..  I would recommend the Rancho Relaxo for sure, its not amazing food but its still good comforting Mexican meals and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First we had some trouble getting in. The front door was locked and the side door said CLOSED even though it was 5pm. Took them a longish time to let us in even though we saw them moving around in the back. Not good for casual business...  We had a large table reserved for a party. The decor was worth some discussion - we liked the crazy striped table cloths and it was overall a dark but kind of amusing atmosphere. They set the table with tortilla chips and salsa which was nice but kind of bland-like.  So after the longish wait for drinks we ordered food; I got the steak quesadilla and my boyfriend, as well as two other guests, got Fajitas. So EVENTUALLY the food comes, and mine is.. okay, the meat is decent excepting the one piece of forgiveable cartilage, but HERE IS MY PROBLEM which resulted in two stars:   The three fajitas came but with only two servings of tortillas and condiments. The explanation was that it was like that for \"space issues\" when there was clearly room for three helpings. But they were hungry and ate anyway, and of course they ran out of tortillas with lots of food left. Now when each customer has paid $15/each for their food and only two people's amount came, why is it a bother to the waitress when you ask now for the third amount of tortillas? The waitress was all snippy and wanted to know how many because they would have to charge us.  This was stupid. And the wait for the food was too long on an empty house. I won't be going back.. we have plenty of other better choices for mexican eats in Toronto."}
{"text":"This latest Rancho Relaxo spot is in the front kiosk space, a chunk carved out of the front entrance of Lee's Palace, the concert venue in the heart of a fun strip of Bloor Street known for a vibrant night life. There are a few late night fast food joints around, but nothing like Rancho Relaxo's interesting take on Mexican snack food. There is room for four people to sit and look out onto Bloor St. at the window and ample room inside to order and stand and eat. We shared the Taco special (3/$10). There are five choices for tacos and you can mix and match. Jerk chicken was very good! Nicely seasoned chunks of white meat and spilling over with crunchy cubes of diced tomatoes. The fish was delicious too (there is never enough fish in one of them so get three!), and the pulled pork was not a hot item but a great protein packed taco undoubtedly. The fresh taco shells (tortillas) were amazing! White pillows of goodness there were. To top it all off, the presentation was first rate with a cute little wrapper around the three tacos, all set nicely into a box with a lid good to grab and go. Friendly service as well. This is another great spot to add to the many great spots like the Caribbean place, the middle eastern ones, where there is always another tasty snack a little further down the block."}
{"text":"I definitely agree with Angela K, Rancho has a terrific and delicious range of vegetarian and vegan food. Even though they have a separate vegetarian section on their menu, most of what is in the rest of it can be veganised! There's soy sour cream and soy cheese available for a dairy-free meal. The mock chicken, while not on the menu yet, is a great addition, all you have do to is ask.  I've never ever walked away hungry or disappointed from Rancho. In fact the time I tried the fried soy ice cream I was whatever the complete polar opposite extreme of hungry is. Pretty cheap eats, friendly wait staff, and a cosy atmosphere (downstairs, never eaten anywhere else there) all make for a really solid evening out.  Oh, and the margaritas? Perfect. Get a shaker, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love rancho relaxo, before becoming a big fan of mexican food, this resturant gave me the push i needed. I enjoy the chimmichongas, and don't stray away from them too often, they are just delish, and go perfect with a lime margarita. The only thing i was weary of is the extra charge for Vegan cheese and Sour Cream, boo! Otherwise all should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great find with a delicious vegan & vegetarian menu! Special tip: they have mock chicken that can be substituted into most items but it's not on the menu yet!   Although I've tried the mock chicken and really love it (perfect texture and good flavour), my favourite menu item is the Potato Pasilla just a little bit of spice and incredibly filling.   I have eaten downstairs and on the patio and both are really cosy and comfortable places to eat. It's really nice to be able to eat side-by-side with my meat eater friends and no one has to go without.  Also, the staff has always been friendly and responsive without hurrying me out of there (I've sat on the patio for quite a while without being rushed out). They're willing to cheerfully answer any stupid or not-so-stupid question about their menu - both to describe the flavour and to explain the vegetarian/vegan-ness of all the dishes.   I highly recommend Rancho Relaxo - it's comfortable, cozy, friendly, tasty, and vegan-friendly. Yum."}
{"text":"Good service. The food is not awesome. I had the quesadilla and it was not very tasty. Margaritas did not impress me either. One of the upsides: very cheap. Not sure i would go back, however. If you want a burrito, Kensington market (just around the corner) has a better option for you."}
{"text":"We went for dinner & reviewed some work material! I had the calamari in a taco bowl & it was lovely. Their cocktails are tasty too!"}
{"text":"I love Rancho Relaxo. Simply say \"I am vegetarian/gluten-free/vegan/allergic to ANYTHING,\" and they'll be incredibly attentive to your needs.  The food is fantastic. This is my favourite place to eat in all of Toronto.   It is under new management, and I would encourage all of the unsatisfied former customers to return here.  It's a great place where everybody (meat eaters included) can get something fantastic to eat."}
{"text":"Vegan options, as far as the eye can see!  My vegan friend had her birthday party here last night and we all had a great time. The service was a little slow, but considering we were a table of 17, the place was full and there were only 2 servers on the floor, I'd say they did a pretty awesome job at keeping it all together (while smiling!)  I ordered the vegan potato enchilada. It was fine, but had a bit of a bitter taste to it (burnt?). The potatoes inside were soft and creamy, and I basically tore apart the tortillas to get to their delicious insides. My neighbours were splitting an order of vegan nachos with faux chicken, and after tolerating their orgasmic moans for about 5 minutes, I asked if I could sample their gigantic dish. The moans were definitely justified. The nachos were piled high with roughly 2 cups of guacamole, a pound of vegan cheese (Daiya, the good kind) and a bunch of other stuff. They made bar nachos look like crispy piles of crap. One girl noted how the chips were bending under the weight of all the fixins, the other (a vegan) stated that the faux chicken was the best she'd ever had. I will definitely be back, just for those nachos.  Also a winner was the deep fried (soy) ice cream. Let me paint a picture for you: I haven't had real ice cream in roughly 6 years, and even when I did, I could barely eat a whole scoop of it. I figured I just didn't like ice cream all that much (plus it made my teeth/stomach hurt). Since the lactard diagnosis, I've been buying soy ice cream for when I have those rare cravings, and I've found the taste and texture to be lacking. Enter Rancho Relaxo's deep fried soy ice cream. Upon the first bite, I just about wet my pants, then asked my vegan friend to promise over and over again that it wasn't real ice cream. It was incredibly creamy, rich, and tasted like butterscotch ripple (I think). It was a giant ball of ice cream, covered in fried corn flakes, and drowned in agave nectar. My friend and I had no problems finishing the whole thing, even though he also isn't a huge ice cream fan.  Honestly, if all i ate were the nachos and ice cream, I would give the place 5 stars, but the enchilada was such a miss that I would imagine that there are other things on the menu that aren't so great.  I will be back again, and I may have found a new place for my carnivore husband (they also have meat foods) and I to eat side-by-side, without either of us giving up anything.  Also, the prices are roughly $10-15 for a huge entree. Yes."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after work today because I had 2-3 hours to kill before my script run-through, and also because the book keeper at work had suggested it to me yesterday.  The place looks really ghetto on the outside because of where it's located: -every other store on that side of College Street was closed and marked up with graffiti.  I'm not the type to dine at such sketchy-looking establishments, had I seen pictures of the restaurant and its neighborhood, I probably would have chosen another place. However, despite its questionable exterior, it was lovely on the inside: both the food and the atmosphere.   Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted immediately by a very friendly waiter who allowed me to sit wherever I wanted. When he presented me with the menu, he asked if it was my first time there, and gave me a brief introduction of its menu. When I told him I was vegan, he informed me that EVERY item on the menu could be made vegan and that I did not have to stick with the vegan/ vegetarian selections. He said they even have fake chicken for the items with chicken and soy cheese to replace the regular cheese. I'm not a big fan of cheese,  even if it is soy cheese, so I stayed away from the items with cheese. After a lengthy deliberation, I chose from the vegan/ vegetarian list the \"Tofu Borracho\" -tofu sauteed in green tomatillo and tequila salsa with nopales and pico de gallo.  I was very impressed with how fast the food came and how delicious it was. The entree came with rice, refried bean, and salad -which was supposed to be a coleslaw but they gave me a garden salad because of my dietary restrictions. I was also delighted that they gave us a basket of corn chips and salsa to munch on while the food came, -much more fun than the conventional basket of dinner rolls or bread sticks!   My Rancho Relaxo experience came to a happy ending with a ball of fried soy ice cream with agave nectar and sprinkled with cinnamon. It was yummy and surprisingly not too sweet, despite the agave nectar. I'm very impressed with this dessert because it's 100% Vegan Friendly -meaning no compromising or uncertainty on my part! I had a wonderful dining experience at this place. The service was good, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was casually pleasant, and they cater to vegans/ vegetarians. A great way to end the typical 9-5 day: very relaxo and very delicious."}
{"text":"Had the Camarones Al Diablo (sauteed shrimp) and it was pretty good! The shrimp were large, tasty and you get quite a few. The side rice and beans were also quite good.   The staff, however, kept getting my friend's drink order wrong, like at least twice but finally got it right.   Deep fried ice cream was great, both the soy and vanilla.  Planning on going back, esp because we have another online voucher! :)"}
{"text":"We went on Tuesday and it was 2 for 1 fajita night, so much food for $20 it was amazing. The waitress keeps forgetting our drinks but other then that its nice and quiet, a real local gem. She forgot a coffee and then a mixed drink. Authentic style real good Mexican"}
{"text":"Very good place if you want to eat mexican food. Prices are cheap and the food is pretty good! Portion are big and drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Really tasty burrito, really fast. They also have a nice looking selection of salads and other items. I'll be back to try them! The staff were really friendly too :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mexican food, unfortunately rancho does not live up to expectations.  We went there because several Yelpers rated it pretty high and were in the neighborhood.  But I have to say, I've had much better.  The good: the staff were friendly and the service was prompt.  The meh: In general I'd say the food was average.  Certainly not exceptional or even particularly flavourful (in fact most of what we had was plain ol' bland).  The bad: Mexican mice were at best \"grocery store jalapeno poppers\". Very disappointing.  The \"cheese\" filling tasted like cheese-wiz, the mice themselves were only luke-warm and the batter/breading was completely uninteresting.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Satisfaction for drunken cravings that's about it.  Decently priced tacos at 3 for $10.00.    Toppings are a bit lacking and the sauces are a little overdone to compensate it seems.    Great for locals I guess but not the drive out."}
{"text":"My friends and I popped by here yesterday for some dinner and drinks to catch up :)  The place was a little..dingy to say the least. The washrooms were oddly shaped, and I couldn't imagine using them again.  The service was okay. Our server was super nice, but she forgot a few things and we had to ask for it multiple times. Also, our water was never refilled during our stay there.  But on the other hand, the food was really good.  We had   1. The Queso Flameado with the Cactus - it was awesome. Basically a grilled piece of cheese with cactus and onions and other mexican goodness. Served with flour tortillas which I found a bit hard (over toasted).  2. The Steak Fajitas - they were okay. The steak was mad overdone, and the peppers were perfect. The guac was pretty good, but I can make better.   3. The Quesadilla Tinga - It was really good! Deep fried tortilla pocket with cheese and chicken and other stuff. Served with rice, which was nothing special, refried beans, which were pretty good, and salsa. The salsa was awesome!   4. We also ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas. It was delicious. Full of tequila. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Other notes:  They do give you a free basket of chips and salsa when you sit down. The place was empty as f** when we walked in (at 7pm on Wednesday)  I'm not sure if I would go back or not."}
{"text":"small burrito is *really* small and not very filling at all, compared to the old big fat. also, the staff was poor at communicating the available choices to me. had to correct my order part way through. the food was tasty enough i guess, though. if i come again, i'll get a large next time"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I have had the best tacos there. Because I don't eat meat, I wondered in for the vegan sign. This is not a vegan place, but they do have amazing meatless options on their menu.   I came in during a weired time and there was no customer at all. So I got to customize my tacos with things that are not on the menu. Not sure if they will do that for you when they are busy but it was soooooooo good.   I tried their crispy couliflower taco, spicy yam taco, and the mock chicken taco. the spicy yam was my fav! And the service was great. They didn't seem dead just becasue there was no one else there. Overall, great place. Will come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I came to this place right after a vacation from Mexico so I was still seeking that authentic Mexican flavour (not Taco Bell). Suffice to say that this place was really Rancho Relaxo! They do a very nice job with the decor in making it seem like you are in Mexico and the music definitely helps a lot.  We went with a big group and I liked most of the foods I tried and I know most of my friends did as well.   If you're looking for good homestyle Mexican food then this is a good place to go. The only problem is that most of the time it is rather empty (although it is a large place so its a bit hard filling it up) and the service is decent, not the best but I can't really complain too much about those."}
{"text":"Meh.  Nada para escribir a casa sobre.  The presentation of the food isn't very appetizing.  Your meal comes as a mash of Mexicanish items on an oval plate.  The menu has a lot of enticing items amateurishly prepared. The decor is a cheesy interpretation of a movie version of a cheesy Mexican restaurant.  Props to the Don Quixote statue and disembodied demon head in the centre of the room though.  The staff is cool and cost is low so if you are in the hood and feel like having some rice, refried beans, and something wrapped in a tortilla, give 'er."}
{"text":"3.5  Rancho Relaxo is a go-to for indie shows, sometimes bringing in international must-see bands at low cover costs. The venue upstairs is small and gets hot and sometimes the bartenders seem to lack friendliness, but overall the vibe is great and I've had some highly enjoyable times here. It doesn't fare well for viewing bands though, as unless you're standing near the front it can be difficult to catch a decent view. Live music happens almost every night though so it's a great place to stop by sometimes when you just want to see a band.   Downstairs we've got some of the best margaritas in the city. If you go, get the traditional ones not the blended! They're homemade and delicious, but they go down quickly so be careful! Service downstairs is a bust. Frequently waiting incredible lengths of time for food and often having to wave the servers down to ask for a beverage since yours has been empty for 15 minutes. I haven't had too much food, but the food I've tried has been really great - avocado salad with grilled chicken was top notch. I'm picky with meat in general but was impressed and pleased by the chicken. Friends always seem to enjoy their dishes too, especially the vegan and vegetarian ones.They're definitely generous with their servings and there are a few things I look forward to trying in the future. That said, every time I've gone we've asked for separate bills and they've never messed up so they do pay attention.  My overall thoughts: if you want good margaritas and some delish tex-mex go to rancho downstairs, but be prepared for a longer visit than you're used to. Then stay for the music and head upstairs."}
{"text":"*3.5*  my bf & i recently came back from our vacation to mexico . we had some amazing food there (local restaurants ! not the resort's !) that we were craving for some mexican . we've actually never been to a mexican restaurant before in toronto (other than so called mexican - taco bell & chipotle mexican grill)  when i told my bf we should go to rancho relaxo, first thing he said was that sounds like some mexican rub & tug . LOL . the atmosphere inside is very mexican-y . i loved the tablecloth, it reminded me of mexico so much . :)   we actually beat the dinner rush by about 20 minutes . there were only 2 tables including ours . service was very friendly & nice but despite just 2 tables, it was slow . we were okay w it tho, we laughed it off remembering it was like that everywhere in mexico . as soon as we ordered, so many people came in, one after another . 2 tables jumped to about 9 . there were only 2 servers . i saw a couple come in and leave after a couple of minutes because the servers were too busy to seat them (no hostess!) . i also saw a family waiting to order for a really reallyy long time, looking angry . i felt really bad for the servers (& i guess the customers too) as they were actually really sweet .  now food !  for appetizer, we had the mexican mice . i didnt want to order it because of the previous review on here, but cheese ? fried ? the bf most certainly did . i actually really really liked it . the outside was soo crispy and inside was sooo cheesy . right out of the kitchen as it was tongue burning hot .  for entrees, my bf had the steak quesadilla & i had the grouper w avocado mousse . i ordered grouper because i love seafood & i love avocado . how can it go wrong ? it didn't . but it was still way too bland for my liking . damn . i shouldve known ! fish & avocado ? theyre both naturally bland food ! i really liked the salad dressing, rice & refried beans that came w it tho . super YUM . the steak quesadilla was good . better than my grouper .   i think i'll be back to try different items on the menu . but not for a while as i need to try other places in search of my favorite mexican place . (in toronto . my absolute fav mexican place is at la mission on cozumel island, a MUST TRY if you ever go !! )."}
{"text":"Not sure if there's a downstairs to this place or not, but this review is based on my most recent experience upstairs.  It was a mild summer night. Brisk enough that you had to wear a light hoodie or jacket outside. I walked up to the upstairs portion of Rancho and it was a total sweatbox. I could feel the stale humid air embrace me as soon as I walked into the venue. I could see a ceiling fan spinning around quickly by the stage, so I knew this was a sign this place had no air conditioning. It was borderline unbearable being in there. I could see they did in fact have something resembling an air conditioner to the right of the stage, but it was dripping water like crazy onto the carpet below creating a soggy atmosphere and the sensation of someone continually spitting in your direction.  Went to the back to get a drink and there were two people working, yet they seemed to be occupied with other things as several people were waiting for a drink and the bartenders wouldn't even look in your direction. One girl was on point but the other dude seemed clueless and took his sweet time preparing drinks and shots. The back part of the venue is the hottest part of the bar, so trying to order a drink while sweating your ass off is uncomfortable to say the least.  This particular night was hip-hop so it was mainly MCs and DJs on the stage and the sound was absolutely terrible. Unless you were right at the front of the stage you couldn't hear a thing. At the back all I could hear was mumbling and bass. And it was so low that you would be surprised there was anyone even on stage at all.  Definitely not a venue I want to frequent. If there's one good thing I could say about Ranco Relaxo is that it makes other venues I thought were bad look better in comparison."}
{"text":"I attended a Christmas party at Rancho Relaxo last week and experienced the rudest service I've received in a very long time.  I was not alone in my experience... After speaking with a number of the other guests in attendance, we all had the same findings."}
{"text":"This place is completely changed. It used to be my go to place for Mexican food, but the new menu is completely different and I'm not really keen to try it (gnocchi at a Mexican restaurant?!) Prices have gone up. Very sad, bookmark removed."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the only reason I am even giving this restaurant two stars is because everyone enjoyed the food, so kudos to the kitchen staff.  HOWEVER...the service was ABOMINABLE!! We arrived and got our menus and some water and ordered drinks, which took quite a while considering the restaurant at the time was quite empty, and when they finally arrived they only had two drinks for the four of us, so had to wait another 5-10 minutes for the other two. We finally order our food, which takes a good hour but was thinking it takes time to prepare good food so I didn't worry about it. When the food arrives we have been siting with no water or drinks for quite some time so ordered more water and drinks and ate out entire meals without receiving them.  Finally when our dirty plates had been piled there for a good 20-30 minutes someone took them and asked if we were done and wanted our bill, which we promptly replied yes because we, at this point, just wanted to leave despite the fact that when we arrived we were looking forward to a few drinks and dessert. So we wait another 20 minutes still no bill, and when he comes over he asks AGAIN if we were done and wanted our bill...SERIOUSLY! Well suffice it to say I only left a 5% tip which earned me a scowl...but shouldn't I be the one scowling?"}
{"text":"I'm no connoisseur of Tex Mex, but I'm just gonna say that I adore Rancho Relaxo.  I can travel forty miles just for a bowl of their chicken n' lime soup.  So tasty.  The rest of the menu is okay too, but their chicken lime & cheese soup is one of my very favourite foods in the world.   Just don't go there with a large group, or you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a good review. It's not necessarily the nicest looking resto from the outside, which is why I have never thought of going here, and the presentation of food is poor, but it's good and there are lot's of menu options. May be too many.   What I am most happy with is the amount of vegan options. They have chicken and steak substitute which can be put in almost every burrito, enchilada etc. and Daiya cheese! They also have soy sour cream, which I didn't try because the waitress forgot it. That's ok. I'm sure I didn't need the extra calories.   The drinks are not so good as they use pre made mix, which makes margaritas and things too sweet. So they're not exactly authentic or fancy round here. They were also out of margarita mix when I went. I had some special summer raspberry drink that was like a red freezie. No good.   But its reasonably priced and worth it. And definitely if you are vegan here is where you will get satisfying mexican food, that doesn't skimp on ingredients and flavour."}
{"text":"If you can get a table here and get served, DO IT!  My friends and I made a reseveration to go here for dinner which I remember at the time thinking was unneccesary, but my friend insisted as she had tried to go on multiple occassions and had been told they weren't serving food (despite it being well within their hours of operation) so we played it safe.  Lucky we did, since it seemed like moments after we got our table, the place was packed.  We tried the Queso Flameado with cactus as a starter which was really tasty - unfortunately we had also ordered vegan nachos which went to the wrong table and so we didn't get them until our meals came, but once they did they were also delish and loaded with toppings. I had the Burrito Con Guacomole with faux chicken and it was out of this world.  It was enormous and stuffed with so much deliciousness I am practically drooling just writing this. The faux-chicken was prepared incredibly well, super tender and loaded with flavour.  The guac is awesome and generous (nothing is more disappointing then skimpy guac!) and their salsa verde is crisp and complements everything perfectly. My friends had an assortment of other things (fish tacos, garlic soup, etc) and everyone was raving about how good their food was.  The drinks are also spectacular, I had the classic margarita but tried my buddy's Michelada (a pint with lime, worchester and tabasco) and it was unlike anything I've had before and worth going back for on its own.  We tried the deep fried soy ice cream for dessert, and despite being more than stuffed from dinner I couldn't help but offer a helping hand in finishing this treat - again, a very generous portion, the batter was crisp but not oily and had a fabulous honey drizzle that went perfectly with the soy cream.  I need to stop writing now as my stomach is starting to grumble.  Worth the 5-stars despite the nacho hiccup, go go go!"}
{"text":"This is a really, really good three stars. :P With a couple of tweaks it could be a four but I don't feel like giving it four yet.   I went with hubby and friends after a fan club event on a Sunday, and the place was empty at about 6 pm. It's a cozy, fun little establishment with lots of warm bright colours. The staff were friendly and quick (although one of our party remembered them being quite scatterbrained on her previous visit there, not bringing her food until it was cold).   They have fancy Mexican-inspired cocktails, good local beer on tap and Mexican beer in bottles, and some mocktails too. We started with chicken-lime soup, which I think was the tastiest thing we had -- strong savoury broth with a tart note from lime, chunks of grilled chicken and avocado, and toasted tortilla strips on top.  The entrees were very tasty and filling although the side dishes were odd. I had chicken mole enchiladas -- yummy and just spicy enough to make me sniffle a bit. The sides were tomato rice, refried beans, and salad, although it was really only a big spoonful of each, and the beans seemed to be unseasoned and unsalted. I'd prefer choosing two of the three and getting bigger helpings, rather than just a taste of all three. The salad was excellent and fresh with a tasty house vinaigrette dressing, and lots of non-lettuce veggies.   Vegetarians take note -- most things on the menu can be ordered meatless, or even with tofu or soy meat.   We got deep-fried ice cream for dessert, which turned out to be a huge ball of ice cream rolled in bits of fried batter (think of something like sweet panko crumbs) and drizzled with honey and cinnamon. Very good and strangely reminiscent of a marshmallow-krispie square. I've had deep fried ice cream before that had a proper whole crust of batter around it, and this was unexpected.   The washrooms are on the main floor but are single-toilet only and rather small. Aaaand I saw a roach in the ladies' room. :/ But it's an older block of buildings downtown and that's probably a constant battle.  Apparently there used to be a Spanish restaurant in here; the Rancho has only been around for about five years. The clues were the Spanish decor elements such as a statue of Don Quixote and a giant painting of windmills, which according to our server were there when they got the place. (When I described it to my inlaws later on they actually remembered having been to the Spanish restaurant with the statue and the windmills about twenty-five years ago, and seeing a lady dance the flamenco upstairs.)   The prices were good; for $60 before the tip hubby and I each had a pint of beer, a bowl of soup, and an entree, and we shared a dessert. Overall it could be a little cleaner, with a little more consistent food quality, and it would definitely get another star. It's still worth a recommendation and a return trip."}
{"text":"New menu!  Mmmm, the vegan chicken echiladas here are rockin'!  The gazpacho has disappeared, thankfully.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and was pleased with the food. I had the \"3 Amigos\" which basically gives you a small portion of 3 different dishes. Points for them for offering this. They had a holiday drink menu that was tempting, but I just went for the food. Absolutely zero complaints about the food.   Everyone there was really nice, but it wasn't even busy and I found the service kind of slow. We had to ask another server to please tell our server we would like the bill (after a long wait). I also feel that the decor leaves something to desire. It is kind of kitschy, and while that can be kind of funny and laid back, I wouldn't really feel good about taking someone out here. It is a good place to relax with friends though.   I probably will eat here again, and I hope to be able to upgrade my review. Maybe it was just an off night for them, service-wise."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE!  I am vegan and I dined here with a non-vegan friend. Guess who was served the vegan entree? Not me! They gave me the real chicken while my friend was obviously eating the seitan entree. I was understanding and told the staff who then got the manager. All I wanted was a new dish and, perhaps, an apology. Instead, the manager yelled at me and told me I was wrong. So, I didn't eat my entree and neither did my guest. They made me pay for my food anyway. What an embarrassing night....  DON'T DINE HERE!"}
{"text":"Service aint that great but i still liked the place alot.  Servers smiled alot and had fun with us even though they were busy. Food was worth more than the low prices they were charging and my favourite thing about them is the fact that they aren't stingy on the quantities in anyway - order nachos with gaucamole and you will be shocked. Everything was fairly good there, and the soy deep fried ice cream made me want more (as someone with a lactose intolerance).   Great place to stop by, but not necessarily a destination restaurant. Good food at good prices that will make the soul happy.  p.s they have a huge selection for meat eats, vegeterians and vegans! and the vegan and veg food is actually good !"}
{"text":"You've changed.   You used to be my jam, now I don't recognize you in the slightest. Price have gone up, portions have gone down. Dishes are altogether different. I understand your need to try new things, but I can't help but feel left behind in your journey to reinvent yourself.   I don't want to be the one to hold you back, so I won't. Clearly we're both after different things, and we have grown apart these past few years. Now is your time to be your new self, experience new things. I want you to feel the freedom that you are entitled to in self exploration.   Maybe in a little while our paths will cross again, and we can see if our mutual interest have realigned.  Until then, I will dream about the old times where I was satisfied after a single meal and didn't have to order additional plates in order to no longer feel hunger.   Good bye for now and I wish you nothing but success with your new identity.  P.S. The new food is fine, I am not faulting the options or taste of the menu. Just that it's no longer a place I am keen to visit. Also, the male server/bartender is as off putting and as they come. As my friend described it; his presence is akin to a seagull flying into the restaurant and shitting on his food."}
{"text":"What on earth happened to this place?  What we had before was beautiful. You used to serve up the best fricken chimichanga's in all of Toronto. Your chicken quasadilla's were delicious. Your lime soup was perfect. I kept coming back. I used to love seeing the friendly staff who greeted us. But then you had to renovate and completely change/shrink the menu. This is not the same place it was.  How do you even call yourself a Mexican restaurant anymore? Most of the items on you menu weren't even Mexican such as the New York steak and ravioli. Since when does a Mexican restaurant serve ravioli!?  I wasn't interested in anything on the menu and it was all over priced. I managed to get three tiny lousy tacos that weren't even good tasting at all!  This is not a Mexican restaurant anymore. If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food. DO NOT COME HERE.  Goodbye Rancho Relaxo, it has been nice knowing you."}
{"text":"First of all, Wanted to rate 3.5. Had tacos, the offer was 10$ for 3, so yeah why not? Ordered fish, pulled pork and chicken. The fish was the best, it had an amazing sauce. I think they could be more generous about the ingredients. The wall painting outside on the front façade is so good that the place catches you immediately. I'll be visiting another time to have the burrito."}
{"text":"Not a great burrito- pretty short on the toppings, although the \"pulled yam\" was a nice \"meat selection\", they were missing burrito staples like corn, and were not at all generous with fillers. \"regular\" burrito was in fact small, and for $8 (which I'm used to paying downtown at places like Fresh West) I expect a lot more."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, but I must say, this place is a little underwhelming...  The salsa that they serve to start you off is nothing special. Very simple, but ok.  The sizzling calamari is delicious, but there is hardly any calamari in the dish. Don't get me wrong, I love veggies, but this dish was 80% pepper and onion, 20% calamari - not what you expect when you order calamari...  The enchiladas were pretty mediocre. The dish I had came with one chicken, one beef, and one bean enchilada. The chicken and beef were pretty good, but the bean was literally just refried beans in a tortilla - SO BLAND!   The sides that the dishes come with are really small, a lot smaller than you would expect based on other Mexican restaurants. The rice had no flavour, the defied beans also were basically flavourless, and the salad was almost not there. The salad was in an itsy-bitsy cup, and it was a little on the wilted side.   The servers were nice, but one of our guests had to wait 10 minutes for their meal to come out after the rest of us had been served our dishes, and we all ordered at the same time.    I had high hopes for this place, but I was pretty disappointed and won't be going back since it really was nothing special."}
{"text":"I like that they have amazing vegetarian & vegan options.  It isn't that common within the Mexican food genre.  Super slow service.  Stingy with the basket of chips (seriously?  If we're waiting THAT long, give us another one...)  I watched two groups come in after us, order - eat - & leave.  HELLO?  Where's our food?!  Once our meals finally arrived, my enchiladas were soggy.  & not like, 'cooked-in-delicious-sauce-&-cheese' but more like 'I've-been-sitting-back-there-for-a-while-now'.  Also, small portions of beans + rice come with your meal but don't utilize the space of the plate very well.  Not-so-great presentation.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Darn.  I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Wow. Really surprised how poor the food was here. Not sure if it was an off-day, but I'd expect 9pm Friday night to be peak time. I had a chicken burrito and it was terribly bland and overly wet. It's only after I ate I noticed this place had changed hands since the last time I went there. Not recommended considering other options close by."}
{"text":"A solid standby, Rancho is not the best Mexican food in the world, but by no means the worst.  I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed.  The staff is always friendly, Margaritas are good, and the staff will make virtually anything on the menu vegan by request (they have faux cheese, meats, and everything)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I like this place - there are some things that I like, and other things that stand out as no-no's.  I'll explain.  The food is good, and the fact that everything can be vegan-ized comes in very handy, esp. if you're in the company of strict vegans.  That said, there was a charge of $1.50 for each person who ordered vegan?  This wasn't clear off the website menu, at all.  The site has to be updated, anyway -- it's still running an old promo of 2 for one fajitas (outdated since two years ago).  I've been here before, and it was ok.  One of my preferred dishes was the Three Amigos.  I think what I don't like is that if you go in a group, that service becomes VERY slow.  To the point that even if you're generally a really patient person, the realization of time going tick-tick-tick will hit you.  And once that happens, there's no turning the avalanche back.  :P  The last two times that I went, we had the same waitress.  She's not terrible, but RR is understaffed since she was unable to provide much service to us.  Service was no frills.    The atmosphere is nice, happy warm colours, temperature was warm except when the ceiling fan hit you - authentic like it would be in Mexico...  The food itself is ok, but I wish they didn't assume that everyone wanted vegan.  I was trying to avoid vegan fake sour cream and fake cheese - I would have gone for a vegetarian entree.  And then for each of us to be charged for that \"Daiya\" cheeze - I just about \"daiy-d\"...  Margaritas were m-eh.  My rad guy and I ordered them in lime, again virgin.  I thought they'd have more natural lime juice but I was very wrong.  Would I go again?  Maybe.  It's kind of convenient for me to go to. I have a coupon for it, but all in all - I'm starting to feel blase about eating there.  Better service and not charging for cheeze that doesn't actually cost more tha reg. cheese, would be a start in luring me in particular, back."}
{"text":"I'm sticking with my 4 star rating for Rancho. But I think it might be pure nostalgia.   I've seen a cornucopia of shows here, and not once has it started within an hour of when it's meant to start. This is likely the fault of the artists (many of whom I know and love, and am a fangirl of) but. man.   PEPPER'S PISSED: About being sleepy. Last night started at a million o'clock, yo.  20/30"}
{"text":"Much more \"mex\" than \"tex\", this place is worth checking out. They actually do speak Spanish, which is a must have in anything Latin-related.  Huge portions, a little-tiny-bit on a pricey side, but I would say for the quality of food - well deserved. Nothing special in a drinks department, though.  I liked the interior - quite authentic and nicely arranged. Service is good, though it takes a fair bit of wait to get the plates for a big round table. Hopefully the order gets faster for the smaller groups.  Recommended, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with some friends to Rancho Relaxo and didn't know quite what to expect. The front entrance looks a bit dingy with a small patio, but once you get inside it looks like they stuffed it with all sorts of random Mexican stuff. It is a bit dark, but feels rather homey inside!   My mushroom addiction meant that I had to order the portobello quesadilla and I was pretty happy with it! Better than I expected as there were lots of meaty portobello slices throughout the quesadilla. Three of us actually ordered it and we all loved it.  My other friend ordered this dish that came with flour tortillas and a big skillet full of melty cheese with chorizo and other good stuff. He was stuffed!   They have beers, they have some cocktails.. margaritas, daquiris, pina colada.. I had their mango frozen margarita which I found a bit too heavy-handed with the syrup, but I generally don't like things too sweet.   Our server, a very friendly blonde lady who worked the bar at the back as well, was excellent. She joked around with us for a bit and we found out that she has something like 5 chihuahuas, which is scary.   Fun relaxing place to hang out with friends if you happen to be in the area ^^"}
