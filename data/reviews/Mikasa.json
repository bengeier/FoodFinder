{"text":"We booked a reservation at Mikasa for Mothers' Day. I can't say anything bad about the sushi, because it was lovely. But the experience was definitely tainted due to the lack of good service. For context, the group that came after us, ordered after us, received both their entrees and main meals before we even got any of our food. We finally had our sushi a full hour after we had ordered. Not to mention that part of our order was missing, but he played it off as he was doing us a favor by replacing our order. To conclude, I'm definitely disappointed by their organizational skills."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi. Service was very good, Had two servers greet us as soon as we entered. Our food was prepared very fast, and their presentation was one of the best I've seen. 
Oh, and the female servers & bartenders are very attractive as well!"}
{"text":"Avons commandé et avons attendu 1h15 dans le restaurant pour notre commande.  Au téléphone, la dame mentionne que ce sera prêt pour 18h30 et nous avons eu nos sushis à 19h45.

Après vérifications, ils ont vendu 1000 forfaits GROUPON à 25$ pour une valeur de 50$ alors voici le pourquoi le restaurant ne suffit pas à fournir.  Bravo pour avoir fait de la promo et avoir fait fuir votre clientèle régulière.....

Même sans promo, ils ont de la misère à livrer à l'heure !"}
{"text":"Super ambiance, super accueil et d'excellent sushi. Je pense que j y retournerais souvent!"}
{"text":"Go there a lot for lunch.  Tasty sushi lunch special that come with a very good soup.  

Not so sure about the other items on the menus.  I had a udon soup but that was not very good.  Stick with the sushi."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD SUISH 

Been there many times the food was always excellent 
Service always good.

A MUST VISIT"}
{"text":"Sercice was extremely slow, but it was on mother's day. Sushi were ok., have eaten better!"}
{"text":"Il y a peut-être un an, j'y suis allée avec des amis et wow! Nous avions été vraiment impressionnés par la qualité et la fraîcheur des sushis. L'originalité des saveurs étaient également frappante.

Sur le menu, on retrouvait plusieurs sushis (même certains sucrés) et des rouleaux de printemps façon.... meilleure! Nous en avions essayé un avec fraises, laitue, thon, etc. C'était délicieux. 

Nous avions également essayé le tartare de pétoncle servi dans un demi citron. C'était parfait!

Aussi, pour on ne sait quel raison, une entrée nous avait été offerte par la maison: des lanières de thon crues panées et frites avec mayonnaise épicée. Un délice!!!! 

Le service était professionnel et le décor était sublime (même les toilettes étaient belles!)


P.S. Malheureusement, pour ceux qui habitent Montréal et qui voudrait aller à celui sur Peel, il n'est pas à la hauteur de celui à Laval. Ça vaut la peine de se déplacer."}
{"text":"My top two criteria for any review are quality of food and level of service and Mikasa excels in both.  This is easily one of the better sushi places I've been to and all of the rolls we tried were outstanding.  It's definitely a little on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for.

The level of service here goes above and beyond what I would ever expect from any restaurant.  I went in with a group of coworkers, most of which are not traditionally sushi eaters.  Our waitress made the entire experience effortless by taking care of all of our ordering for us.  We agreed to let her pick out a variety of rolls, and she brought them to the table one at a time for the table to share.  The pace and variety were perfect.  She did an excellent job describing what was in each one, and each roll was delicious.  I can't remember ever getting this level of accommodation in a restaurant, and it was greatly appreciated by the entire group.

I will happily come back here again and do the same thing."}
{"text":"We went to laval specifically to try out this sushi spot, after hearing great things about this place. We let our waitress pick out all our dishes and we had no regrets at all! 


As far as drinks, we tried the Black & Gold Sake, which was really tasty and smooth. I would definitely recommend trying it. We started our meal with the lobster salad, which was simple but delicious. The Salmon Tartare spring roll then came out & was beautifully presented -- it tasted as good as it looks. The Rockefeller oyster was good but definitely couldn't have more than 2-3 because of the mayonnaise. We also had an Anaconda roll, which consist of of salmon tartare and eel. By far my most favorite sushi dish was the Salmon Belly roll. It was lightly seared on the outside & tasted amazing.

The service, food, and decor was all amazing -- a must try if you're around Laval or want to venture out of Montreal for some tasty sushi."}
{"text":"On my 3rd visit to this resto, I had a perfect dining experience with my friend. We reserved the tatami room for 4 people, then last minute we were 2. Our waiter was understanding and allowed to stay in the room. It was spacious and private so we loved it. We shared 5 dishes and half pitcher of lychee sangria. The amount was the perfect amount for drinks as we had 3 glasses each. We started with the best salmon tartar I've tried so far. Then my favorite maki roll which is the crunchy roll. Then we had the sashimi spicy salmon which was very tasty and maki avocado roll which were surprisingly small. To finish we had the sashimi roll which had cucumber on the outside. This was my least favorite dish. The service was very good, our waiter was courteous and super nice. The group beside us were quite loud but it is unavoidable as the rooms are not solid to the top, there is space. I would have liked a warm cloth at the start to freshen up my hands. This would add a personal touch to the experience. The washroom is clean and nicely decorated. Overall very tasty, fresh and great presentation. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love mikasa ! Always amazing the sushi is to die for and at a pretty good price for a really fancy resto :) the sushi pizza is amazing"}
{"text":"I feel as if its so rare that I can go somewhere and give them a 5 star review. Service and quality seems to be lacking these days and I'm sure places will start shutting down soon because of it, however Mikasa is NOT one of those places.

We tried some of their sushi creations at Fetes Gourmand in Laval in August so one night my husband and I wanted to go out. The sushi maker (I'm sure there is a much more technical term for him) recognized us so we sat at the sushi bar to chat a bit.

We ordered off the menu and then asked the sushi maker to go ahead and just make us a few rolls of whatever he recommends that I hadn't already ordered.

Everything we ate was to die for. The flavor combinations were just out of this world, the presentation of the food was beautiful, and the staff was friendly and attentive.  

One of my favorite things that we had was something that was not on the menu, it was a salmon rose, in an oyster shell with rice, lobster, and a few other goodies that was torched (yes with a blow torch) for a nice burnt flavor... all the textures, flavors, and colors were just too incredible. I would go back just for that!

This place gets a 5 star review and they will see me again soon! :)

Oh and you know how sushi sucks the next day? Not Mikasa sushi, it still held up and tasted just as fresh as the night before."}
{"text":"Once again the head chef Tek outdid himself. A true Master at his art, he produced a well balanced feast for the senses with his tasting menu. The pictures speak for themselves"}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan, but Mikasa's is not in another category, but in another universe!

they are original, beautiful and so very good! Ambiance is great, service is number one. Come alone, come with a friend or a loved one or with a group in their tatami rooms... Just make sure you have some time in front of you, its not a fast food! Thankfully, their Apple Martini is devine!"}
{"text":"Ce n'est plus la qualité que Mikasa pouvait avoir en plus d'un service lent qui frôle l'inacceptable, je ne remettrai plus les pieds ici, il y a tellement de choix de bons sushis resto aujourd'hui que ça ne vaut plus le détour."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place, we've been traveling for business the last month and made this place a weekly dinner place.  The service is excellent and food better!  Can't wait for next Thursday!  (Thanks Mimi for being awesome!) - Going to miss this place when we have to go back home."}
{"text":"Check-in pour ensuite me faire dire que la cuisine ferme de 14:00 à 16:00, e. Plein milieu du Centropolis, une belle journée d'été.... Avis complet à venir lorsque j'airai la chance de goûter les sushis."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant  in Montreal. They have 3 locations but my favorite is in Laval. The service is great and the quality of the food is always fresh and very tasty. The Mikasa roll and the Lobster roll are a must. Definitely make a trip here whether it's for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We went here for my  husband's birthday with a bunch of friends and I was disappointed. Although it was a Saturday night, the place was still quite empty when we arrived around 7pm and it still took a half hour to get our drinks--which were nothing special! Getting our food was also a drawn out process!  The service was slow, and I mean S-L-O-W! We ordered a mix of probably 60 sushi pieces--which were good, but I've had better...much better. Therefore we won't be returning. I don't recommend this place for true sushi lovers, this place is average at best."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, fresh and very well presented, lunch combo is of good value and very reasonably priced. Sashimi is fresh and tasty, nigiri had a thick piece of fresh fish, rice well cooked not mushy and not hard, maki had a good balance of fish/sea food to other ingredients (tempura, rice, vegetables and fruits), i tried also the shrimp tempura , big shrimps and vegetables, well battered and cooked as it should. House salad was delicious, maybe one of the best Japanese style house salad i ever had, miso soup was full of flavour and generously portioned. Lovely decor, reflect the style of food. I was disappointed with the service, slow and waitress is not very welcoming, not bad service but not impressive. Prices are ok for the quality sushi your getting. I would definitely come back. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great quality food and excellent service. Favorite dish was the Anaconda roll! Nice ambiance and friendly staff. Very attentive. 

I was apprehensive at first as the restaurants around it were packed with people. I was glad we decided to give Mikasa a try."}
{"text":"Came here on a food hunt for Sushi after work. This place looks very modern, well kept, and its lively. I like how the music isn't way too loud so people can really enjoy one another's company. They have an upstairs section for seating as well but only open on the weekends. Above and beyond in terms of he layout, two spiral designed wooden columns and a spiral staircase with a waterfall wall. There is a full bar in the back and the sushi bar is right up in the front. 

The hostess and servers were very friendly. I feel like a fool Bc I don't know French but they made me right at home and catered to my indecisiveness. 

I got an Asahi beer , sushi platter for one, and a kani salad with shrimp. Good things first the beer and the kani salad. Spot on. Just wish maybe the kani salad be chopped up and mixed but I liked the presentation and all the ingredients were super fresh. More in the vinegary side which I like a lot and I topped it with a little spicy mayo. 

Then onto the sushi platter, this is why I had to give it 3 stars. After visiting so many sushi places across the US and Japan, I always say that the most important factor is the rice. Duh you need fresh fish, that is a minimum requirement for a decent sushi place, but the rice and the presentation makes it all. Presentation wise I was impressed, my plate looked great and it wasn't too busy. It was the rice that just turned me. It was sticky but not very moist, and more cold than warm. A little too much sesame on one of my rolls but that was mostly preference. I noticed the rice he most on the Nigiri - the fish was so fresh that it melted away almost instantly but the rice sponged up like a sticky ball and didn't breakdown along with the fish. 

If you know your sushi - you'll know what I mean unless they address the rice issue. Please focus on the rice! Otherwise everything else is great."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I've been to the one on L'Acadie a number of times, but this place is a disaster in terms of service. We waited over an hour to receive our sushi order and once it arrived, the server plonked down the plate and left. Didn't explain anything like they normally do. We also had to ask to get the small plates that hold the soy sauce. Seems he'd forgotten. They also left a part of our order out and argued that they served it. Not to mention, they put the whole order of sushi on 1 plate: we were a table of 6...
Overall, food was good, but won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience. Not cheap but above the rest. Good service. But we are there for the food so it was amazing. I was surprised they were not that busy. I am not sure what I was eating as I did not order the dishes. But unlike most times where you dip into soya here all the dishes had their unique sauce. I will be back. Our guests from china loved it."}
