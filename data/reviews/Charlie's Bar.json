{"text":"A typical local bar! Nothing special. Smoker friendly! Drinks are good and the bartenders are nice, plus the machines will give you play time! Plus a lot of TV's in there so chances of catching the game you want is on in there!"}
{"text":"So I used to come in here quite a bit, when I lived closer,  so stopped by today as I was in the area, yes, I had terrible luck on their new machines, but the bar tender was more concerned with her personal phone call than she was in getting my diet soda I requested and never did get. 
Ok I was only there briefly, but long enough to know that I wasn't her concern, the personal (assumption) phone call she was on was obviously more important to her than her only customer. 
I was originally going to order food, and request drink again, but she didn't give me a chance to,  I would have had to interrupt her conversation, and she stood on the other side of the bar, I guess so I couldn't hear her conversation but it also made it difficult to ask for anything so I just left, then she asked me if I was \"good\". I'll go get a burger at Wendy's."}
{"text":"$3.50 a drink. Happy hour -- midnight to something (haha, I can't remember. I was pretty drunk). Well anyways, happy hour has $2 drinks and $1 buds.

Can't remember if you have to pay to play pool but I remember giving up ID to get the balls from the bartender.

Ok this is a pretty sad review. I had a little recollection of that night. Too much whiskey for this kid."}
{"text":"Machines are very tight but they have a pool table. Bartenderd are excellent. Food is average bar food. Overall an ok normal vegas bar"}
