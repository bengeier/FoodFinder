{"text":"I'll eat anything. Don't get me wrong. I love great food. But I'm also not super picky.

This was terrible. Awful. First of all, breakfast isn't hard. But it was for them. The buffet seemed lackluster so I ordered eggs Bennie. It's kind of my \"treat\" when I'm traveling. I was informed a little after I ordered I couldn't have them because they were out of English muffins and ham. It's Thursday. Really? 

So I opted for the buffet. The hash browns tasted rancid. That made me fear the eggs. They actually tasted okay. But by then I was put off. The bacon was half cooked and so greasy. And the sausages - well at least they were cooked through.

The muffins were stale and the croissants were undercooked (hint: they shouldn't be white).

I felt bad for the server because she seemed aware everything was crappy. She was at least quick to refill the coffee (which wasn't terrible).

I wasn't expecting 5 star dining but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"This restaurant, located insider the Radisson hotel Toronto airport was very clean and had a vey friendly wait staff. Our bartender was friendly, pretty, and very accommodating to our requests for food and drinks. She was attentive and provided quality service. Though we did not eat there in the morning, the restaurant was packed with assuming happy patrons."}
{"text":"We went in this restaurant in the hotel because it was convenience, not my choice but my family's. Milestones and Swiss Chalet were too busy for them on a Friday night, no one in this place so quiet. Apps were good, nice French onion soup but small portion. Do not order sandwiches, very small portions on grocery store sandwich bread and small sides - not worth price. I make nicer grilled cheese sandwiches at home, without finger holes in the bread. While server was attentive, he overstayed his welcome. My family was on a stopover so it was my only night to see them for a few hours. The server lingered and made inappropriate conversations we were not interested in having, even going so far to joke about my RMT career and refer to me as a masseuse. We did not want to be rude, so we eventually left irritated. I served for 12 years and would never imagine lingering unwanted at a table making conversations of my own choice to pass the time."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I stayed at this Radisson twice and were given continental breakfast vouchers on both occasions. We didn't have time to take advantage of it the first time but we decided to give it a try on our second visit.

The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine. Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated; it felt as if we had just gone from year 2010 to 1980's...

The experience pretty much went down hill from that moment and on...
1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.

2. The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled. 

3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...

Well, I can go on and on about how bad this place is but I won't... You probably get the idea anyway... Stay away from this place since there are so many choices (and MUCH better) right outside the steps of this hotel (Tim Horton's, Kelsey's, Subway, Milestones, Sushi, Swiss Chalet and etc...)."}
{"text":"The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it.

As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.

The menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. 

The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?

When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.

The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said \"its frozen, we just heat is up\" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?

I'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious but I will never be going back."}
{"text":"Average service, OK food, and a tad pricey for the portions.  I don't really want to even bother reviewing...unless you're staying in the hotel and the front door is locked, just go elsewhere. $60 in airport vouchers and we still had to pay quite a bit...and I was still hungry when we left."}
