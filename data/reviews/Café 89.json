{"text":"Chill cafe off the beaten path.

Tried:
- Irish breakfast tea
- capuchino 
- oatmeal chocolate chip cookie

Spent a lovely afternoon working at the cafe. They have good wifi and a fair number of chairs lining the window which make for a good workspace and view. 

Tea was smooth and the cookie was great--not super sweet which is just how I like my snacks. (Plus their day-olds are half off which is a nice deal.)

Would definitely come here again. They've got a fun selection of comic books too for when you need a break from work or something to read with your cup of joe."}
{"text":"I am continuing with my friends our journey to coffeeshop with our passport that we got from restomania. 

It looked such an adorable place from outside. When I got in, omg this was my land. The theme was travel; a cork board  hanging on the main with postcards from all the world with the map of the world in the middle. The chair were funky with current politics issues caricatures. I was just simply enjoying everything about this. Beautiful photographies on one wall. By the cash, a piggy bank says travel fund. The lighting of the shop was nicely bright.

I asked our server about the piggy bank, since I love traveling. She said her bosses, a couple who travels brought it from Australia. Our server was a sweetheart.

I ordered a quilted rooibos tea. Loved it. 

Need to visit this, it's just so amazing."}
{"text":"What a lovely little cafe with a beautiful travel theme. The first thing that caught my eye was the big travel board with postcards from around the world and a world map. The second thing that caught my eye was all the photography. There are gorgeous pictures all around this cafe. My friends and I ordered tea and we enjoyed the selection. The barista was very kind and helpful. The cafe also sells little bags of candy. My friend decided to get a bag and we really enjoyed that as well. Definitely returning to try some of their food. Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is a super cute, relaxing, and retro styled cafe. It's literally on the main floor of a condominium complex, so it's the perfect spot for everyone living in that area. The cafe has large glass windows and white walls so it's quite bright. It is owned by a couple who travel a lot and bring back a souvenir which they add to the cafe. They have postcards from many cities on one wall along with other memorabilias. There's a ton of plants. The chairs have socio-political related caricatures and pictures printed on them in an abstract fashion. They have superhero decor as well. They have only a few tea options and coffees. Some patisseries and lunch options. They have a shelf dedicated to gummies. My friends and I ordered a tea and enjoyed it with some gummies. You can sit outside as well. It's a perfect place to relax and read a book with a coffe/tea."}
