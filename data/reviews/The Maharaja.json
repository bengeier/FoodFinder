{"text":"The decor and ambiance of this place is absolutely amazing... They even offer a tour on your first visit.  Our server spent over 10 minutes reciting an extensive menu - it was really overwhelming and we still didn't know what to order! We ended up ordering a meat platter that was not on the menu and it was delicious. The rice alone was out of this world. And the most savoury meat on the platter was Murg malai kabab (we have a non spicy palate). For our main course, we ordered a chicken and a paneer dish. The chicken was really good, but the paneer was too bland - it was the only non spicy one on the menu. Surprisingly, the naan was not that great, so I would stick to ordering rice.   Don't skip desert! The saffron flavoured kulfi was mouthwatering good! I will definitely order it again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Can't really rate the food. The service is sub par and it's incredibly loud, so much so that I had to leave. The ambient music is at level more appropriate for a cocktail lounge and it didn't help that the next table had three out of control kids. The menu is elaborate and looks good but I don't like dining at daycare."}
{"text":"Look, the place is real nice and all, and it has all the right feels for a more upscale indian, which is nice.   So ambience of when we got in - perfect. But then it goes downhill. Didn't get any rudeness and maybe it's cuz they're new but holy it takes soo long to get service. One member came a bit late and ended up having to go to the waiter at another table and ask him to come over after 15 mins. All he wanted was a beer lol. We made a quick comment about it to the manager/owner just as a courtesy and we could hear him chew out the waiter in the back! Cmon, there was only one waiter for every table, not his fault.  Food: average. Not bad, but upscale places you expect a brilliant chef and many tastings before making a menu. Hugely diverse menu, but why do it so broad if it's all average? I'd put it well below Nirvana and Avani in taste of food.  But still a nice place and when they work out kinks and menu it'll be better IMO. Decor and all is so nice it can easily trick ppl in enjoying it more than the food allows."}
{"text":"Excellent food & ambiance!! Royal treatment - truly Maharaja style!! This place has become my favourite place for Indian cuisine outside india!! Their marinations, spice levels and dishes are the best in Ssauga... Definitely The Maharaja would give GTA competitors a run for their money & customers!!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food. Amazing customer service. They take time to know you. Very good experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food place in Mississauga. The staff is very attentive and the customer service is the best. I called the place for a reservation but the call went unanswered so I made my reservation online instead. I received a call back regarding the call and I was pleasantly surprised since I didn't leave any message for them to call me back. The best part was I mentioned on the call if they do cakes since I would be there for my Husbands Bday, they politely refused and said they can do an India Dessert instead on which I didnt comment. Once at the restaurant, to my delight they wished my spouse Happy Birthday (they had made good notes on the call) and also at the end of the Dinner surprised us with complimentary Indian Dessert with a fire Sparkler. Thank you Team Maharaja for your hospitality and attentiveness."}
{"text":"First time @ The Maharaja. I have only good things to say. The food is the most authentic Indian food, with the right amount of spice. It is a whirlwind of flavours that will tantalize the tastebuds. It is not your typical Indian restaurant food full of grease, salt and pepper, to the contrary it is ideal blend of flavours that truly take the food to it's finest.   The ambience is cozy and exotic. The service is par excellence from the greeting, to servers and the host.   This is far the best Indian food, I have eaten outside of India. The quality and variety of dishes are truly unique and creative that combine to make it a memorable meal.   The staff offer genuine advice and sincere service.   Overall, this place is gem. You will be treated like a Maharajah!!   Thanks Jhangir, Oomyang and the rest of the lovely staff.  Seven Stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! A unique restaurant located in Mississauga, provides a feel for the Indian culture and heritage. The restaurant staff is very kind and the wait times are justified as well. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who is looking to have a delicious meal and a surreal historic South Asian experience."}
{"text":"Everything is going except......food   Its not worth at all. Food was bland. Presentation was good. Servers were well mannered so no problem there but the food was below expectation. Meat items looked fresh but less flavourful. Overall, we were not happy and will not go again and will not recommend anyone. They need to change their chef for sure."}
{"text":"A gem of a boutique restaurant! It's intimate setting, amazing service, unique drinks, fragrant, fresh delish dishes, each spiced just right will have me coming back for years to come!! It's a keeper! Jyoti"}
{"text":"Great ambience, delicious food and service was first class. The hyderabadi dum ki biryani and butter chicken were off the hook. The place is pretty fancy so just be mindful when taking kids. Prices are on the higher side ofcourse considering it is a fine dining experience but there are many dishes averaging about $15-16"}
{"text":"Went this past weekend with a group of friends. Hands down the nicest indian restarant I have been to in the city.   Service was excellent as our waiter took the time to explain everything on the menu. Service was actually really good, where as in most indian restaurants service is quiet terrible. The ambience is quiet nice, looks very classy. However the one issue we found was that there was no background noise,making it aqward at time with the silence. Background dinner music would definately help. To my understanding though, they have a excellent sound system and it was just out of service that night.   As for the food, it was excellent. The veggie dish consisting of pomegrans was fabolous. Lamb kebabs were amazing, melt in your mouth! chicken dishes were really great as well. Only objection I found was that it lacked a bit of spice, but that may have to do more with our selection.  Our group all had the indian summer which was a great cocktail.  The one issue I found is that the menu is just too overwhelming. I understand that they are trying to provide a variety of menu choices, however, the booklet just makes it too complex to choose something.  That being said, this is a great place and with a few adjustments will be even better. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had in Toronto!! I had a lamb shank dish. It was so flavourable. The service was great, too, and everyone who served us was so welcoming and cheerful. I'll definitely come back again and spread the good words about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Can I give this 5+ stars.  By far.  Seriously the best Indian food I've ever had.    The friendly and helpful staff were knowledgeable & attentive.   Beautifully decorated.   Well kept.   Clean.    I organized a group birthday luncheon there and the whole group was very pleased. I will definitely be back.   Don't let the location fool you.  It's a real gem.  Tip : order from each region; share the dishes and let the staff serve the food to you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like those fancy restaurant overseas that your family/friends take you to when you visit. Super decadent and full service, great food and wonderful decor.  I've been here twice: first for lunch (without reservation) and again for dinner (with reservation). By the second visit they had vastly improved their service. The first time I came here, our server was an Eastern European looking woman who didn't really know how her way around the menu, or how to answer our questions. The food was still fantastic (we got their equivalent of butter chicken (chooza makhani) and tandoori chicken skewers (murgh tikka), and some paneer dishes) and we were pleasantly surprised by the full-service aspect. We were very impressed and recommended to friends and family. However, a family friend said that they visited on a busy Saturday night and did not get the same level of service, and had long wait times for food and drinks. So, we were a bit nervous about coming back on a weekend evening with more family, as we had come for lunch when there were only 2-3 tables and the food was still took a bit of time to come, so we could only imagine the wait when it was a busy weekend evening.  We came back on a Saturday evening (with reservations) two months later, and they must have worked out their earlier kinks as we had an even better experience! Our servers were super knowledgeable and charming. I think they must pool tips here as we had a few different people coming up to us and they were all incredibly friendly and helpful. We had some vegetarians and some meat eaters at our table, and everyone was satisfied. The food did take a little bit of time to come, and we had to reorder our appetizers as there was something wrong with the system, but we didn't mind very much. As we really enjoyed the murgh tikka and chooza makhani the first time, we ordered them again and had no regrets. Their chicken is the best I've ever had-- so tender, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I also really recommend the shajahani baadal jaam for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Overall, the food tasted great, even the papadum that came before our apps was very nice.  We all ordered 2-3 alcoholic drinks each, and the bartender was nice enough to come to our table and explain the drinks to us. I would highly recommend their mango/pineapple margarita. Their Bloody Mary doesn't have much flavour and is a bit watery, so I wouldn't recommend that. One small snag: I ordered 2 margaritas, and the first one that came definitely did not have alcohol in it. I brought this up to the bartender when she came with round 2, but she was quite defensive and insisted the first one had alcohol. I'm 100% certain it didn't as I'm very sensitive to alcohol and couldn't taste it at all in the first one, and everyone at the table tried it and agreed with me, AND I could definitely taste the alcohol in the second one which means it was missing in the first one.  The first time we came, the owner came up to as and we chatted about their renovation work. The second time, he approached our table awkwardly and asked how things were, then started to walk away, then turned back around as if he wanted to say something else, then left. Yikes, awkward. I appreciate when owners/managers visit tables, but please be more confident in your approach!  Our bill came to $280 after tax and tip for five people, so it's definitely not a cheap place, but as someone who likes to eat out a lot and can appreciate it when a restaurant pulls out all of the stops, it's reasonable for the service, food and decor. Not sure if this will replace our regular spot (Avani) as it is so decadent, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looks like they made quite an effort to make it an upscale restaurant. They offer a tour of restaurant, which is not needed and looks like a show off. I don't need to know where they bought chandeliers from! Food wise, menu looks very attractive with cuisine from 4 different regions of India but behind the scene not sure if Chef(S) are that versatile. We tried Awadhi cuisine and specially Koh-e-Awadh (lamb), not good. Murgh Lababdar quantity was shockingly small. Naans were good. Good ambience but it's hard to maintain quality of such diversified menu."}
{"text":"Service and food was great...will be back. Ambience was great .Best Indian restaurant in Mississauga. ... Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Called for reservation, owner picks up doesn't know how to speak and take reservations as his phone etiquettes needs to be polished, only after an back and forth with me, did he finally apologize and basically insulted me with backhanded compliment. Big no to this place kindly work on your service. One star for at least PICKING up your phone."}
{"text":"I was in town for business, so I thought I'd go somewhere nicer I hadn't been before, and try out some Indian food.  If you show up and think it seems pricey (it is a bit) and feel out of place - stick it out. I felt the same way, but by the end, the food and experience were so good it felt almost surreal.  This isn't your normal restaurant where you come, you eat, and you go home - it's one where you will go and feel like you had a religious experience eating - which we did, even though my friend and I were only there for about an hour.  At first, I was wondering if I was out of place - the menu had several pages with names I couldn't read and pictures of various items and history, and some of the prices seemed a bit high. It was perhaps a bit overwhelming. Then the waiter came over, and she was extremely helpful, asking us what we wanted to eat, and when we suggested Lamb, she recommended some specific items on the menu and helped explain exactly what was what. She asked us specifically about our spice levels, and the food came exactly as we had asked - my friends not too spicy, mine only moderately so.  The food was brought, and they dished it up for us. I thought the dishes were rather small, but then when I tasted it, it was so delicious that I just began eating slowly. I had the Champ Masal and my friend had the Dum Biryani. The food was amazing. As I ate, I found that it was the perfect amount of food as we took our time and they dished up the small portions at a time.  There are many other little gestures you will notice, such as the way they open the doors for you, dish the food for you, bring you a bowl to wash your hands afterwards - and by the end I felt like the waiter was my friend who truly wanted me to be there.   All in all, a wonderful experience in a beautiful restaurant with very delicious food. Definitely worth it. I felt like this is what eating was supposed to be like - delicious food where you take your time and enjoy the experience, without feeling rushed or a burden, and where you felt like the waiter is truly happy to have you there."}
{"text":"Classy Indian restaurant. Food is great but you need to make a reservation. The best dish I tried there was the Lamb Rogan Josh."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to the Maharaja and everyone in our group loved it. Instead of going alacarte we did the Diwali menu which was highly recommended by our Server Kenneth . The food did not let us down, the appetizers and entree's were amazing, could not relish on the deserts as we were already full by then. The service was extraordinary, he treated us like kings and queens, . Will definitely come back !  Ambience 9/10 Food 9/10 Service 10/10"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambience! Food lovers must try! Laal Maas my fav! Congrats Jehangir ! Looking forward to next Parsi food festival"}
{"text":"Would have rated below one if there were an option ! We made an online reservation and were refused to be seated once we were there. Upon arguing , manager told us to wait for half hour or else SORRY ! We left without dining. Although they have great food but horrible customer service ! If your system allows online booking then pay attention ; refusing to seat your clients with reservations is not professional ! Not coming back & not recommending to anyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Incredible service. Unbelievable food. Everything about this heritage place is just great. Many thanks to our wonderful very talented server Kenneth."}
{"text":"Living in Toronto I miss the fine dining experience that is offered by good restaurants in India. Maharaja strongly matches that with food quality, ambience and service. It definitely stands out from other Indian restaurants in the GTA. Don't miss their decor.... You may wanna walk around to take some photos."}
{"text":"My husband took me last night for my birthday.  I must say this is the nicest Indian restaurant I've ever been to.  We walked in and it was so beautifully lit. The decor and ambiance was out of this world.  The attention to detail and Color scheme was amazing.  I've been to so many restaurants in Mississauga and hands down best decor out there.  I particularly love the Meena Lisa painting beautiful.   We ordered the seekh kabob beef and delicious.  Perfectly cooked and not too spicy.  And the presentation was wonderful and unique. We also ordered the aloo paratha and 5/5  We ordered the pudina paratha and that was 4/5 And lastly ordered the chicken boneless in a tomato and onion gravy.  This was my favourite.  So flavourful and delicious.  The experience was perfect. I really enjoyed myself.  I will go back."}
{"text":"I would most likely return to try their red meat dishes (Sikandari Raan). The ambience is what made the experience a great one. The finesse displayed by staff was top notch for an Indian/Pakistani cuisine restaurant, the staff made it a point to serve the first few spoons of the dish on our plates while explaining the spices used. The staff also gave us a warm welcome with a complimentary mint drink and had coatcheck available. I'm a diehard fan of Mughal history so it was definitely a restaurant I wanted to try, considering all my wedding festivities were Mughal themed lol. We ordered the Gilafi Seekh Kabab (chicken), chicken dum biryani (steamed chicken biryani) and Murgh Tikka (Chicken tikka) accompanied with Naan-I-Lasooni (garlic butter naan). They ended our meal with a lemon water cleanse just like back home! $88 for the evening! They are also hosting a Kashmir event Nov 21-26 with Kashmiri cuisine (picture of dishes offered attached). Well done Maharaja!"}
{"text":"It's a gem in Mississauga. I found this place by chance and we planned suddenly to visit this place. And our experience was wonderful. We enjoyed our meal! We ordered Bemisal Paneer Tikka, Shajahani Baadal Jaam as starters ( I was so happy to try Baadal Jaam as it was a new thing to try) and it was yum! Then we ordered Subz Miloni which was seriously damn good! And then with Subz Miloni we ordered 2 Butter naan (or Naan-i-Makhan). I was not sure about the dessert section so we ordered only one Rasmalai which was above my expectations! So we again asked for one more Rasmalai. As I love to eat sweets so I wanted to eat more and more... The Rasmalai was an awesome treat! The taste was same as we get in India! Later we ordered Veg Biryani for takeaway and it was tasty too. Will make our visit once again as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Amazing and Authentic Indian food. Don't miss this place definitely give it a try. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"They should find out the meaning of \"Premier\" before claiming to provide such service. We booked a late lunch on their website for 2:30p. They called and said they close at 3:00p. So why take the reservation? I asked on the phone how long we can stay, was told it would be ok till 3:30p. When we got there the staff tells us we need to get out by 3:15p. Plenty of other good places in the city. Don't waste your time with these amateurs."}
{"text":"He interior was nothing short of royal. The most hilarious picture was Mona Lisa dressed in sari as a maharani.  We were welcome with a complimentary shot of cilantro and lime. We wanted to order appetizers as the aroma was mouth watering but being hungry ordered entree . What a wide variety of entrees from avadhi to Rajasthani to mughlai to Hyderabad. Alas could only prefer 2 dishes. We went for awadhi. One was chicken boneless and another was mushroom based mix veg. Very tasty. Only caution spicy , one red chilli sign, does not mean Indian level of hotness is taste. It was very mild but tasty.  For a change the server serves the food and it was nostalgic remeiscent of Indian restaurants and affectionate servings in India. To top it all, they also served hot water with lemon to wash hands just the way Indian restaurants in India would serve.  A must visit for food, ambience, serving and royal treatment.   It is a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Great experience! From menu to the service to the food and drinks everything was perfect. Just go there with your appetite and a smile, I promise your stomach will be full and you will have a bigger smile. A lot of great choices for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Last week my better half and I went for our anniversary dinner at the Maharaja. Before getting there we went through the menu which seemed interesting and we knew exactly what we were gonna order. Upon entering we were given a warm welcome by the hostess who gave us a mini tour of the restaurant and showed us to our table. To our bad luck the air conditioning was not working at all and it was too hot and uncomfortable for all the guests. Upon addressing the issue to the server he politely explained the reason behind our ordeal. So we ordered Dahi Kabab, veg Hyderabadi Biryani, Baingan ka Salan and Rajasthani Dal. It's not everywhere that food is served on your plate in this part of the world, that kinda reminded me of India. Food tasted good but it didn't meet my expectations. I feel something was missing in flavour.  Also I would like to mention the restaurant decor and customer service goes over and beyond to the point where it is extra and doesn't come across as genuine. However the situation was handled exceptionally well by the server, manager and the owner by greeting and apologizing to every customer for the air conditioning malfunction. Furthermore complimentary dessert(pistachio kulfi) was served to every guest as a token of our understanding. Maharaja is not the place where I would re visit until I get value for money."}
{"text":"The best India restaurant in Mississauga. If you are looking for Indian diner this is the place you must try ."}
{"text":"I happened to visit the Maharaja on a weekday. The ambience here is great. The three Mahals i.e Sheesh, Rang and Hawa depict Indian culture and traditions. The menu is well divided into 4 sections Awadh, Hyderabadi, punjabi and the Rajputana. The hostess started with a tour of the restaurant and that's great. They treat their customers like the Maharaja. My Server Aman was great, he suggested some great appetisers . The Haryali murg ke parche and the Shahjani Badal Jaam were excellent. For mains we had the Sikandri Raan and dum ki murg Asaf ja, with some garlic naans. Their  deserts are all made in house, my fav was the Kesar Ras Malai. I would highly recommend this place to everyone . If you want to taste the real Indian cuisine, this is your Go to place. Fine dine at its best !  Will head back to this place soon:)"}
{"text":"Super fancy Indian spot in Mississauga , Their restaurant logo resembles the San Diego Zoo"}
{"text":"The first Indian Resturant i have ever in US/Canada region which is truly Indian....yes it is. It starts right way in the culture itself. The captain, to the waitress, and the server...truly indian. A warm welcome, intro to the culture, theme, menu design and offering.  Food: amazing stuff!!!! Sikandari Raan was well done and blended with right spices, tandoori murgh was good but could be better in marination, Dal Makhani was outstanding and gelawati kabab was silky smooth. But!!!!! The Naan was very very ordinary. Not up to the mark at all. That was a disappointment for sure. Drink: Nilgiri welcome drink was refreshing but could be good with little black salt and lemon zest added which would balance out the sweetness and bitterness of Mint leaves. My friends tried other mocktails and they were happy Dessert: Slight disappointment. Gulab Jamoon cud have been more fancy for the price and it was ordinary, Rasmalai was way much better than anywhere else i have eaten in this region. Ambience: breathtaking....all the themes were well done including beautiful painting such as Meenalisa an indian version of Monalisa.  New place need more ppl to manage, its settling down for sure so sometimes you might feel left out of attention.   Otherwise a must try place."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the customer service is par none of the restaurants I have been to. The food was authentic Indian..... Well flavoured and spiced. Enjoyed a great evening with family!!"}
{"text":"3.5, if you are ever in Mississauga area, you should give this place a try! It's quite small, would recommend making reservations. I love how when we are seated they give us a refreshing shot-very different! Our server was great, and recommend all our dishes other than the butter chicken we always tend to get. We first started with the mixed skewers for apps - shrimp, salmon, chicken etc with diff types of sauces. It wasn't on the menu, server just put together based on the amount of people we had. We really enjoyed it as there is a variety of flavours- mint,curry, etc. Also it came with different toppings and sauces. As for mains- there is A LOT of options from different parts of India, very confusing at first hence we had the sever recommend for us. Overall I thought the main dishes were OK, nothing stood out like the appetizer. Sauces were however flavourful and the garlic naan was awesome!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Attention to detail. Very attentive wait staff. In addition to delicious food, the wait staff guided us through an excellent selection of single malt scotches."}
{"text":"Very Vintage.   The whole place offers a classic vintage look with its elegant decor and rich Indian Accent. The menu is a delight not only in terms of exquisite food but also in it's calligraphic description of Indian States, food & the history of Maharaja regime.   Our Hostess was well mannered. Service was detailed and in timely manner. Food was great. We were offered welcome drink shots comprising of mint, lemon and some sort of water ( rose water maybe). As a cherry on top, our hostess Desly brought us complimentary Mango ice cream dessert  with kesar pista (she asked us if it's a special occasion, and I told her we're celebrating our anniversary).   Overall we had a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars The restaurant really aims for \"fine dining\" and does a decent job at it via beautiful decor, presentation of dishes, etc . Service was formal and professional but slow between courses.   Chicken main: Murgh Lababdar. This was tasty with the garlic naan I ordered. The sauce had carmelized onions, fresh tomatoes and cream.  Beef Kabobs: Disappointing - really unappealing visually. Colour was red with how much masala was in it.  Kulfi dessert: Better than I anticipated, very rich in flavour and good portion for $6 at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Complicated menu I just wanted to have a quick lunch.  There's no lunch menu, well there is a lunch special but can't share.  I'm sure this is great for supper but they really need to create a proper lunch menu for people on the go.    Service is good but the upsell is distracting.  Confused poor and hungry."}
{"text":"Anybody out there still miss old-school type of service ?   If so then this place deserves more than a five star just for attempting it. Imagine actually somebody serving the food to you at table side. Or how about opening the door when you leave. Not everything was perfect in the service dept as I had to request them to remove the cutlery along with the plates after appetizers. It should be standard to remove both. You will not get this level of service at Bukhara Grill, Avani, The Host, Nirvana, etc. At $25 the shrimp curry was well worth the price for the quality. Fresh tiger shrimp in the thick gravy. The breads were ho-hum.  However just check out this presentation for these kebabs. Marvellous.  The only thing I did not notice which was odd was the plate sizes too big for the table. Even though we were two people on the table hardly enough room on a table for 4."}
{"text":"What a dining experience.   Food is on pricier end (maybe just a few dollars more per dish than your average Indian place) but you get your money's worth with the food quality and the service from the staff.   Us three young lads ate sharing three dishes + naan, at the end we were all stuffed and the bills averaged out to $23 per person. No dessert, no drinks.  They have coat check at the door. It's decorated very nicely but the ceilings are a little low so inside it's a little quiet and the air flow is not like a huge hall environment if that makes sense. They even give you a tour of the restaurant if you ask, but again it is not a big place but I suppose they need to be fancy.  Staff very professional and helpful and they will scoop food on your plate for you first time they bring it out.  They will bring out lukewarm lemon water after the meal for you to clean your fingers, don't drink it!  Try this place out if you feel like getting quality."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is STUNNING inside! Hands down the prettiest Indian restaurant I've been in by far!   The food was delicious and they even catered to some of my dietary restrictions. When I was leaving they said next time let them know ahead of time and the chef could even prepare some special vegan dishes for us.  Awesome customer service! Really great all around.   I only wish the prices weren't as steep for the portions sizes received. I will say though the quality was lovely, but the purchase price of lentils is very low and the price they charge for some of their lentil dishes is rather high.   I understand it is fine dining here but a little give and take (price wise) for certain items would go a long way.   Overall I would go here again for sure. Just next time I'd like to leave with my wallet a little heavier than when I left the last time.   Oh one last thing. The cocktails were interesting but not interesting enough for me to order again. Maybe that would be the only thing I'd say was not to the level I expected of this establishment.   For sure though, give this place a try for any special occasions or even a night out. It really was beautiful and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant another star, because it's really in a league of it's own. The food is worth every penny. Their sikandari raan and amiri shaan lobster was one of the best and most unexpected dishes I've ever had. All of their menus are listed or updated on their website, I called them ahead to see if they have anything that might interest me more than their already outstanding menu.  The service is just as good as the food. They have impeccable timing and are polite and attentive. The decor is beautiful, I was given a tour of the restaurant which shows their concern for minor things also, i am a fan of this restaurant now as everything is truly amazing . Will highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The service was exceptional, the ambience really nice, and the food, well, the food was just ok. We had Tandoori Tiger Shrimp and Achari Chicken as appetizer and the Tandoori Raan as the main dish with some garlic naan and parathay, and their kulfi for dessert. The chicken was somewhat dry, the shrimp were overcooked, and the raan (although fall off the bone soft) had some flavors that did not really gel, such as pomegranates seeds sprinkled on top and sliced cashews. The kulfi was really good, although I sometimes would get a bit of ice with the bite.   Overall, it was fun and I would like to go again and try out some other food items. 4 out of 5 stars for the experience but 5 out of 5 stars for the great effort these guys are doing with the fine dining experience. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Probably the best Indian restaurant experience I've ever had.  Wide variety, staff goes above and beyond.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. I'm not Indian but have been to India several times and I think this place is fantastic. Food was great. It's very lovely and classy inside. Clean and neat. My partner and I will return to have a nice dinner there soon!"}
{"text":"My family came here for my dads birthday. Since we are Indian, and my parents are phenomenal cooks, we are VERY picky when it comes to Indian food (since we are soooo well fed at home)   The meat here is amazing. Kabobs, tandoori stuff...delicious (as I was told from my father). Since I am vegetarian, I didn't get to try any of these meats.   The main curries were ok. Everything is mild,so tell them if you want it to be spicy! The naan was so soft and fresh, and the paneer curry was quite good.   Best thing was the service. Our waiter was very patient and kind (go Kenneth!) I don't think I would come back since I'm vegetarian, but it's a great place if you want to try some good meat."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing place! Creme du la creme kind of restaurant!   Best high-end Indian resultant that I have ever been to ( and I have been to a lot)   Superb value and superb service! Only wish I have enough money to visit this place at least once a week."}
{"text":"While visiting from Florida, where we don't have good Indian food, I found The Maharaja. To my surprise I found a this gem close to Toronto airport. We had the eggplant appetizer which is to die for. I had the Maas Ke Sule (lamb) excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The staff takes good care of the guests. It is a fine dining boutique Indian restaurant"}
{"text":"Great customer service. For first time comers you get a welcome tour for the restaurant design and history. Really antique building. And they preserved the structure.  Food was amazinnnngggggg. Will go there again and again. They explained the menu to you. Very respectful environment. Worthy of their prices for the food."}
{"text":"We have tried 4 times since August to come and eat here on a weekend but they have always been booked up. This time we got a reservation on a Friday at 9pm, which is too late for me. We wanted 8pm but they said either 6 or 9 and my kids don't get home by 6 on a Friday. Anyways, we arrived around 8:35 and were seated right away. My kids and cousin asked for the tour of the restaurant...my husband and I had it last time we ate there. It is very nice how they explain the history of the building, as well as the history of the maharajas and their food. The restaurant manager was our server and they seemed understaffed. At one point he cleared half the appetizer dishes and went to do something else but didn't return to remove the others. The lady putting new dishes out had to put her pile of plates down to clear the others. We had ordered the eggplant app which was forgotten and never arrived and my son requested a second mojito when asked by the server but that also never arrived. The food we did order and received was excellent! The guys all shared a meat appetizer platter that had a variety of about 6 different meat/seafood items. I had the lentil soup app, which was spicy and flavourful. I ordered the vegetables cooked in a garlicky spinach sauce, which was awesome! So great to get spinach without the paneer! The guys shared 2 chicken dishes, lamb, rice, garlic naan and lacheda paratha.  Everyone was satisfied but consensus was they did not like the chicken stuffed with cheese in a nutty sauce. Half liked the lamb and the other half didn't. They finished with kulfi, rad malai and gulag jamun and everyone was happy....except me...no dairy free desserts available. The Green teaser drink was enjoyed by all, hubby had the spicy chat masala drink which I found overwhelming, and my son had the mango mojito which was awesome. The meal is on the expensive side and the server serves you the food when it arrives at the table. I suggest labeling the menu with gf and vegan items so it's easier to get through the extensive menu. Vegetarian items are marked, but marking the others would help me more as I don't want the dairy items. Staff are very friendly and parking is in the lot of the attached plaza."}
{"text":"really nice, classy Indian restaurant. Lots of staff ensures good service. Portions are fair sized and priced. Great if it's a group so you can try many items."}
{"text":"@TheMaharaja_CA #SOULFOOD #INDIANFOOD #EATLIKEKING #YELPGTA  Indian fine dining has never been better. I am not one to eat too much Indian food (because of high spice levels), but at wondrous reviews and recommendation, I had to absolutely try this place. And I left with no regrets.   Maharaja, as I understand - means King. And the interiors of this restaurant is quite luxurious and palatial. The menu is large and varied, and without a recommendation, I wouldn't know where to start. For my no spice palate, the Murgh Lababdar was lovely - think butter chicken but creamier and tastier. We ordered some rice with the chicken, which is the norm.   Shout out to the amazing service and the personable server as well. This place has my stars and my recommendation. The next time you're craving India food, skip everything and hurry in to The Maharaja."}
{"text":"The restaurant is targeting to offer the experience of fine dinning, and it's almost there as well. The service is good. Trained servers with effort to give good services. The interior decor is trying to reflect a fine dinning ambiance, which could be more suitable if it had a larger space and selected (refined!!) paintings.   Food quality vs. price vs. quantity will get a 3.5 star out of 5. But considering only quality, it's definitely good.... aromatic and spicy. We had Shrimp curry (Hyderabadi Tawa Jhinga Masala), mixed daal (Dal Panchmel), Pudina Paratha and  butter naan (Naan-i-Makhani)... all of them were good."}
{"text":"Horrible Food and Mediocre Service is what I can say to describe my most recent experience after visiting The Maharaja.   I am truly disappointed at the food I had during my visit. Gone were the days where the food here was nothing short of amazing and seeing how far down the service has gone is saddening also.   During my visit I had the Dum Biryanni and Chicken Tikka Masala (It goes by another name, but I forgot the name). Had you asked me previously, I would've told you to try it regardless of the price since the taste is so worth it. Now I would say to stay away from this place as the food they produce is not worth it at all!   While the service is still \"good\" for an Indian restaurant, it is nothing like what it used to by initially. While the staff is trained very well with the menu offerings, the \"finesse\" that you'd expect from an upscale restaurant isn't present at all anymore.   Needless to say I would sadly have to recommend to skip this place if you're looking for a good Indian spot."}
{"text":"Amazing good. Best Indian food I've had in a while. Definitely try the skiraandan (lamb) dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food...great ambience!! Kenneth recommended some of the best dishes from the menu and it was right on point! Service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The entire experience was amazing! It was a surprise birthday lunch for my girlfriend and her friends and the staff made the experience even more memorable! The food was simply amazing. Thank you Maharaja! Helped me make an impression ;)"}
{"text":"Went to The Maharaja on two occasions.  Food was excellent on both occasions.  Service is excellent.  Ambiance is very nice, but a bit cozy."}
{"text":"Ambiance and food were really good. Got a crash course into the varied cuisines and the quality of the food was great. Would certainly make this my regular joint!"}
{"text":"TIP:  Ask the server to leave the remaining food/drink on the table if they attempt to remove it right after they've finished serving the table!  TIP 2:  Do make reservations, especially on the weekend.  We went for a Sunday dinner and the place was at capacity.  They have an easy online booking system which will text you to remind you!  Pretty damn close to 5*s!  The *only* reason I cannot give them a full 5* is because our server took away the gravy of the murgh lababdar (very similar to butter chicken) and the pot of chai.  Otherwise, everything from the service to the actual food was great, not overhyped!  Service was very nice and classy.  The server started out the evening explaining the menu, that it's from different regions of India so it's different cuisines, blah, blah, blah.  Atmosphere is also a mix of traditional with contemporary, so you may feel a bit odd if you should up in your late Sunday evening grocery store best.  Not sure if it was because we were in a larger party/celebrating a special occasion, but our server started the meal serving the first main, one-by-one (wedding style).  So after each person was served the murgh lababdar, he took away the rest of the delicious gravy!  It would've been nice to dip our naan in the rest of the sauce, but it was too late.  :(   My BIL felt a bit uncomfortable, so he told the server that we can help serve ourselves for the rest of the meal.  HOWEVER, at the end of the meal, the same thing happened with my sister's chai. The server came with a small-medium sized pot of chai, poured it into a smallish mug, then took away the rest of the pot.  Meanwhile, a group of older Indian gentlemen who were seated nearby had full-on pots on their table.  So we thought that was a bit odd.  Again, not sure if this is their practice, but we would've preferred if they left the remaining food/drink on the table until we deemed them to be finished.   Highlights were the kebob platter (don't think it's on the menu, but it featured different types of meats in different marinades) and the murgh lababdar, again it was very similar to butter chicken.  I don't think you can really go wrong though 'cause everything was pretty delicious!  All the dishes tasted distinctly different, unlike other Indian restaurants were many of them taste very similar.  My bf cannot eat spicy foods and he was fine, so basically anyone should be able to eat here.  I'd definitely go back as this was probably the nicest Indian restaurant that I've been too.  The old school service really does add to not only the atmosphere, but the food as well!  However, it's not a cheapie place, so keep that in mind.  They automatically add a 15% grat to parties of 7+!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Indian restaurants in Mississauga in terms of food and atmosphere. Staff are very nice and polite, however can be a bit akward with serving. I would highly recommend the eggplant with goat cheese and tomato sauce, it's crunchy and savoury. On the weekends make reservations cause tables are limited. This is a great place for fine dining in Mississauga, but is also pricey."}
{"text":"Class is what describes this restaurant the best. Food is just so good. Ambience 5 star. Service 5 star. It's pricy but kinda explains the 5 stars. The 4 region option is too good. Just hope they offer best sellers and different dishes from those regions time and again. Overall verdict: Definitely try."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant. Excellent Indian food. You can choose from Avadhi food to Punjabi to Hyderabadi. Quite an array. The service was excellent. Ours was a table of 8 and it was not easy to ensure that we were catered for. However, Gagan was amazing. He was attentive and at the same time not obtrusive. The dishes were well presented. The Raan was unbelievable. The lachha parathas were as good as I have eaten at any place. This place is well run and well managed.  Only advise would be to get some better looking beverage menus. Totally out of place in an otherwise perfect setting.  Well done team Maharaja. We will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this recently over lunch. Very impressed with the food, the ambience and the decor. Service was good, however our server was not friendly. No smile through the conversation, direct one word answers to most questions. Anyways, that is not the reason for three stars. The only reason is that being a quick lunch, there was not enough scope to review many aspects. Worth a repeat and recommendation."}
{"text":"The Maharaja specialized in showcasing Indian history and offered the royal dining experience. The menu is divided in 4 different sessions; 4 different flavours of 4 different regions of India. Each session has its very own appetizers, main and desserts?.  You are greeted with, in my opinion, the most knowledgeable and courteous server. He gives you the restaurant speech and brings a complementary minty drink (sorry I don't know the name).    We got the lentil and paneer dish, with naan. Their naan is hands down the best I've ever had. The portions are generous.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Kenneth was really sweet and the maharaja has the best service I've received in a while"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Absolutely delicious!!! Very friendly staff and owner, great attention to detail in the decor and setting.  We all had a great time.  Service could have been better, our drinks didn't arrive until the main course and we had to remind them three times."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a generic, cheap, quick and easy Indian meal go to the Amaya in the Square One food court. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Indian food then The Maharaja is the place for you.   Located in a historic building, this place is visually pleasing from the moment you see it. The interior decor is like no other Indian restaurant I have ever seen. It's elegant. From the moment you step in, it's very apparent that a great deal of thought was put into each and every room. As the management mentioned on a tour of the restaurant (which was offered when they learnt we had never been there before), each of the dining rooms have a different decor that matches a theme. From the paintings (\"Mena Lisa\" was my favourite, The Indian Mona Lisa), to the door handles and light fixtures, everything comes together for an ambiance of luxury and quality. Even their menu has separate themes and you can order accordingly. The Maharaja also has a comprehensive wine and alcoholic drink menu which is not usual for an Indian restaurant.   We ordered the Subz Hara Bhara Kebab as an appetizer, the Murgh Lababdar,  Amir Shaan Lobster, Mirch Baingan Ka Salan and Naan-i-Lasooni as the mains, and Lab-E-Mashookh as dessert. Each dish was delightful. I have never had lobster with an Indian twist and it was lovely. The Kulfi was perfectly creamy and rich with flavours of Saffron and Cardamom.   At the end of dinner in true fine Indian dining style, there was a bowl of warm water with lemon to rinse our hands brought to the table.   If you are looking for a fine dining experience with an extensive Indian menu that includes items not usually found in North America, then The Maharaja is a must visit.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant the decor , overall feel and customer service is amazing. However, considering that I already told them during reservation that I am coming to the restaurant on a date with my wife who is pregnant, I was expecting that they will make it special for us but they didn't do anything. Also unlike what was told in the reviews, there was no restaurant tour given to us. The food was tasty and well presented. I would still go there again but this time maybe will push my requirements more specifically."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice decor and well, average food. Given that it's fine dining the prices are high but they are not reflective of food. Sadly we aren't craving for any dish based on our first visit so far.  Having said that, I must admit that everything felt fresh and made from good quality ingredients.  Appetizers: Dahi ke Kebab (Kebabs made of Yogurt) - Sweet and cheesy  Haryali Murgh Ke Parche (Chicken Breast) - Standard kebabs in green paste  Main Course: Lamb biryaani - Flavored albeit with lamb pieces which could be more tender  Khatti Daal - Not what it's supposed to be. Should be thin in consistency and more tangy  Nargisi Kofta Curry (Boiled Egg marinated with minced chicken, deep fried, in a curry) - Best entrée in my opinion. Maybe because I'm partial to eggs.  Pudina paratha - Pretty good  Drinks: Regular Mojito - Perfect!  Rose wine (Sutterhome zinfandel California) - A $10 wine from LCBO but paired nicely with the food  My key take away from our dinner was the wine which I'm going to stock upon for the winters. Maybe we'll return when we're feeling generous and wish to be pampered a bit (hopefully for an amazing palatable experience next time)."}
{"text":"This was my very first experience with Indian food and it was AMAZING! Very friendly staff and amazing food with lots of new flavours!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and reasonable price.staff is freindly i love been there.perfect combination of all spices in almost every item i have tried there so far."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The quality of food is spectacular. So much flavour and meat is well cooked. As soon as you enter the restaurant they take your jacket and youre seated. We got the lunch menu and it was $16 per person for appetizers, unlimited mains, and a dessert.  The only downside was the wait time. The restaurant wasn't even too busy but it took us over an hour just to get food, it was wayyyyyy too long!  Overall, we had a great experience"}
{"text":"This ties for #1 Indian food in Mississauga along with Avani Indian Bistro. Maharaja has an edge when it comes to ambiance and overall service while Avani has an edge when it comes to flavor.   I ordered butter chicken (chooza makhni) and navratan korma. Both were really good. Garlic naan was amazing. So good that you can eat it on its own. Biryani was solid too.  The interior decor is impeccable. And so is the service.   Highly recommended if you're looking for a \"royal Indian dining experience\"."}
{"text":"I came to the Maharaja with a group (four of us total) for some upscale Indian food one Saturday night after hearing a stellar recommendation from my sister. We called ahead to make sure there was space for us and reserved a table on the spot. We were seated on arrival at a corner table, and shortly after we were brought some small, refreshing welcome drinks that tasted like mint. The menu was pages and pages long and overwhelming at first sight. The server explained a bit that the menu was divided by region, but didn't give much useful info beyond that, so I was a bit disappointed by that. Besides that, the food was amazing - the Maharaja definitely lived up to its hype. Between four people, we shared three dishes (chicken appetizer, lamb biryani, and fish filet) some bread (garlic naan and another type I don't remember the name of). Oh, and there were also a couple mango lassi. Needless to say, it was tasty and filling. My only regret is that there was no room left for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"What an amaaaaaaazing hole in the wall place! Great staff from the hostess to the servers. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful, the restaurant has a very antique feel to it. We went here for my dad's birthday today and the staff and the food were well beyond our expectations. The meat and veg appetizer platters are a MUST try, they serve so much variety and if you go there with a big party like ours, it's the perfect starter. Our server Kenneth was really professional and well knowledgeable in the menu and the food, and we were very happy with what we ordered. Him as well as his female trainee provided really fantastic service and were really friendly too. Definitely coming back here next month for my own birthday!"}
{"text":"Wow. The Maharaja is extremely impressive. A true fine dining experience with a high focus on service, presentation and quality. Dinner for 4 with 2 bottles of wine was approximately $400. Considering we selected many of the higher priced items on the menu, I think there is great value here.   The service staff go above and beyond to make the experience one to remember. From a tour of the restaurant with a detailed explanation of the decor and what it represents, to serving the entrees to each guest they did a great job.  The food. Wow. We had lobster apps, a lamb leg for our main along with a few other dishes. Every dish we ordered was great. Highly recommend discussing the options with your host and listening to their recommendations.   In conclusion, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I found this new restaurant advertised in insauga.com. It used to be a pub and they fully renovated to have each area of the dining area be unique and spectacular. I love the decor and the ambiance. I would go back for it!!   Service was wonderful and they were attentive to us.   The menu is divided within four regions of food from India which is interesting. It's fine dining quality.   Happy:  We were well taken care of and were given recommendations since we don't eat at Indian restaurants that much.  We got a lamb curry and a chicken curry with two types of nan/roti. The curry was different and very flavourful. I also had s lentil soup which was a nice starter.   The washroom was clean and matched the restaurant floor tiles which was nice to see.     Not happy:  We ended with an ice cream based dessert which wasn't to my liking. It was nicely displayed but after eating a few  bites, I couldn't indulge it anymore.   Since it was a special lunch, I didn't mind spending the money. But it does add up with main dish with the roti. Over $67 for two people (no alcohol drinks).      Verdict:  I would definitely go back to try their vegetarian dishes and for the decor. It made me feel I was in a fine dining place in India."}
{"text":"If you have not been  here then this is a place to  try out .   I came here   recently with a group . The restaurant specializes in four cuisines that are part of the overall Indian cuisine. India is one of those countries with a different cuisine in each state. The four cuisines are  Avadh, Rajputana, Hyderabad and Punjabi.  There are  various starters and mains which you can order.   Your server will guide you on what to order. We had Gagan who was very helpful and explained  each cuisine to us and recommended various items to try .  They start you off  with a sweet rosewater drink   before bringing in the food.  The restaurant is well decorated with various paintings and decor   with an Indian version of Mona Lisa hung on the wall.   Now for the food.  We got the following.  Avadhi Naan : a soft naan with nuts and raisins and a hint of saffron.  Kebab platter with all kinds of meats  cooked with different herbs and spices  which is perfect for a party of 3 or four to sample and enjoy . Dum Ki Murgh Biryani: Chicken cooked in the dum style with soft  tender chicken cooked in long rice flavoured with saffron JaisalMeri Murgh Bhanjaran: A chicken curry cooked with spices that was not spicy but very tasty .  We also got the Makhni Naan and Pudhina Parata ( mint flavoured) All the food tasted fresh and I made  sure we went with new items that we had not tried before to broaden our tastebuds.  After our  meal   you can request for a tour of the restaurant which a member of staff does and takes you on a journey throughout Indian culture. I recommend asking for this.  This is a restaurant  that foodies must return to to try out new items  from the  four cuisines which you have not tried before.  I will be back someday . Also avoid doing repeats of  what you have had before  to enhance your experience .   As foodies keep on trying new things and avoid the boring and familiar. I have probably said this in  other reviews but its a point I feel all foodies must  follow so that they have a great time wherever they go and not be limited in any way ."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the looks of the outside! Inside is beautiful and redesigned to match different areas of India. My boyfriend has been here before and he really enjoyed eating here that he took me here for our anniversary to celebrate. We love Indian foods! Maharaja is more on the fine dining side so it will cost a little more than your usual Indian restaurant. Service and quality is impeccable.  We made a reservation (would recommend to do so) and upon arrival, we were greeted very warmly and hostess offered us a tour of the restaurant. She basically told us the history of this building and each of the rooms history. It's designed accordingly. We were seated and they gave us a complimentary 'shot' which was non-alcoholic but it was minty and refreshing. The menu is extensive and may get confusing to you but our waiter was helping and explained to us how the menu was set up and what he recommended to order.   I enjoyed all of the items we ordered but my favourite must be the eggplant appetizer. I normally don't like eggplant but it was highly recommended to get from my boyfriend and the waiter. I would grab 2 servings of that next time!   Since they knew it was our anniversary, they surprised us with some sparklers and a dessert which was nice of them! I wasn't a big fan of the ice cream.. was mixed with some spice so it tasted a bit odd to me. Other then that, I had a great experience here and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The decorations and the style is so special~ And of course, the food is good, I like masala very much ~"}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant in Toronto. We would always ask for Omang as our waiter but he is the manager now.  The waiters are all polite and nice.  Ambience: very warm.  Decor: feels like you're actually in India.  Food: AMAZING Price: a bit high."}
