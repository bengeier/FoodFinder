{"text":"I had the Chicken White Pizza that has spinach too. Its the best white pizza that I have had in Oakland so far.

This place may seem like a little hole in the wall, but the cooks seem to be authentically Italian and make great pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizza served up by a friendly and kind staff.  Laurence and her boyfriend and their staff are serving up some of the best thin crust pizza in Montreal.  In terms of pizza varieties, all the old classics are here, plus a whole bunch of new whimsical ones that Laurence dreamt up - L.A. Stoners (a pizza with onions, mushrooms, pepperoni, bacon, peppers, mozzarella), St. Patrick (a pizza with green pesto, chicken, artichoke hearts, spinach, green peppers, onions, feta) and many others show that this family run restaurant is not content to serve up the regular standard fare, but are willing to push the envelope and innovate and create to give their clients the best pizzas they possibly can.

The pizzas are made fresh and with love and care, just the way Nonnas (Italian grannies) would for their families.  Eating a pizza here is like eating a pizza that your own Nonna would have made for you!

In terms of efficient and friendly service, you can't go wrong either.  Laurence is accommodating and gracious and helped me when I asked for personalized gift certificates to be made for a special gift that I gave to the doctors and nurses that helped me through a difficult medical situation.

If you're ever in NDG and craving some pizza, make a point of eating here.  It's better than all the pizza chains that offer greasy pizza with rubbery fake pepperoni; treat yourself to some real pizza, the way it's served up in Italy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a couple of simple slices. It's a dingy little store front without much seating room. There's a small table for two and a handful of bar seats that lookout on a gas station. $3.20 for two slices of plain cheese is decent, and they are big slices. They are the type that you almost have to fold in half to handle, especially when straight out of the oven. Nothing special, but not disappointing."}
{"text":"Before I start this review, I moved to Pittsburgh the beginning of August and found that there was quite a lot of pizza places around my apartment. I've tried a couple other places, no names mentioned, but they seemed too expensive for the quality pizza I got. Today, I decided to try this place, and although it might look like a hole in the wall DON'T let that fool you. 

The moment you enter, an elderly man greets you and takes your order whenever you are ready. Although this is my first time trying this place, the man was very friendly and wanted to chat about how your day was going. I ordered a  small pizza with 4 toppings, it only cost me 11.95 without tip, no credit cards, cash only. Before people ask, yes, I gave the man a two dollar tip. Fifteen minutes later, my pizza was ready. 

I'm one for Papa Johns usually, but no longer will I buy there. Instead, I will continue to buy my pizza here as the quality of the pizza, to me, seems a lot better. The crust is not too thick, but crispy, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Another plus is it's not drowning in sauce, there is just enough on there to make everything happen. 

I didn't give this a 5 star rating as I've only been here once, but with this first experience, I will be trying this place again whenever my pizza craving gnaws at me."}
{"text":"While the place itself is relatively small and kind of a hike from Pitt's campus it is definitely the best pizza in Oakland. Reasonable priced, fast service, good food, what more could you ask for? Also no, don't bother asking for delivery."}
{"text":"sauce was bland and did not arrive very hot. Limited amount of toppings"}
{"text":"Best pizza and Italian food in Oakland PERIOD!!!! Nice family owned establishment . Great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Really great little pizza place. It's a small neighborhood shop that has that great family-run blue collar feel that Pittsburgh is famous for.

 Whether ordering a whole pie for delivery or stopping by to pick up a slice or two for lunch or a late night snack I'm always greeted with a smile and a genuine thank-you for my business. The older fellow that is usually there is straight out of a dictionary entry on \"pizza shop owner\"  and is truly a master of his craft. There's no ridiculous wait times or hidden costs here,  just great pizza at a great price made by great people. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Pittsburgh several years ago we were desperate to find a great pizza place like we were used to in NYC.  Well, we found it.  The pizza is delicious and incredibly inexpensive.  We have not tried any other menu items because every time we go there we just cannot get past the pizza!!!  And what is great is that we can walk to this place, talk about convenience.  Even the little shop screams NYC.  And love the nice older man who runs the place.  He is a man of few words but the pizza that he makes is sooooo good.  If this place ever closes we plan to move."}
{"text":"We always get take-out from this place. Love the Vegetarian Plus and the Spéciale Crevettes."}
{"text":"Service complaint. I have had this pizza before and it is the best value pizza around. However tonight I placed a pick up order and to my surprise the employee said he forgot to make my order. No sorry. No discount. I have worked in a family Italian restaurant before and this would not be tolerated. To screw up an order that bad and cause me to wait another 20 minutes without making it right is ridiculous. Time of order was 730 on a Monday."}
{"text":"This is place makes a great pie!!! The sauce tastes home made and the pizza came quick hot and fresh! They custom made a delicious pizza for my pregnant wife, Not only that but the owner is the nicest guy, he even called back to make sure we enjoyed the food! You don't see customer service like this anymore, really impressed! This place is my go to for pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Brooklyn and now live in Chicago. I spent 15 years in Pittsburgh so believe me when I tell you that this tiny crowded little unassuming shop has the best pizza in Pittsburgh. It's the best I've ever had outside of New York and New Jersey. I ate here up to 4 times a week and when my wife and I visit Pittsburgh it is one of the first places we go. Get a simple slice - you can get toppings but you don't need them. The crust is incredible and the slices are massive. 

If you go and see the elderly Italian gentleman sitting behind the counter say this to him: \"Mr. Scott says hello.\" His face will light up. You probably won't get free pizza but you'll see just how personal the place is.

If you aren't in the mood for pizza, all of the hot subs are great as are the huge calzones - again, it's that crust!

If someone tells you Mineo's is the best in Pittsburgh, thank him or her and then head to the corner of North Craig and Bayard in Oakland to Pizza Prima. Mineo's is good, Pizza Prima is amazing."}
{"text":"I just relocated to Montréal from Chicago and, while I love the people of Montréal, there are just moments when you get home sick for your favorite haunts. When I stumbled upon Pizza Prima at 9pm after moving all day, I felt right at home. The place is owned by Laurie and her BF and manned by her whole smart, beautiful family. (I love small family business.) Laurie bent over backwards to make sure my five year old got exactly the pizza she wanted (not on the menu) and everything came out fresh, warm and delicious. (The Bacon and mushrooms pie is yummy!) This is traditional NY style slice pizza made with care from fresh ingredients by someone who enjoys what she does. I can't wait to try the pear and Gorgonzola....yum!"}
{"text":"Stepping into this place, you feel like you're in some weird NYC stereotype.  It's a small store with a counter and most of the room is taken up by a pizza oven.

A personal size pizza is $4.50 and it's usually more than generous.  We've ordered small calzones, and what comes out is a 4 pound monstrosity of awesomeness.

I eat here about once a week and would recommend it to anybody looking for decent cheap italian fare."}
{"text":"I only tried a calzone. It was huge and greasy. Not a whole lot of flavor. i did enjoy the bread. I am near this place a lot so I'll have to give it another try. Will update accordingly."}
{"text":"Family-owned business with excellent pizza! Try the pear and gorgonzola. Yum! Best for takeout/delivery."}
{"text":"Since Maximum Flavor, who sold really meh pizza, has closed down, there is no pizza near CMU.  It was nice out last week so I decided to take the walk up to Pizza Prima.  Had I known how much better this pizza was, I would have walked here all of the time!

The little old Italian man who runs the store doesn't beat around the bush but is friendly.  The pizza has so much cheese, and the crust is good too.  A slice of cheese pizza only set me back $1.75, and it was a big slice.  I would love to come back and try the white pizza or a pan pizza.  The specials are amazing too.

There is a single table and some counter space, but there is no air conditioning so this is really best for takeout.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Nice place for a casual bite! Just right around the corner of my place. Find it on yelp, and it is certainly  not a disappointment!"}
{"text":"i live around the corner and noticed a great college special of 2 gyros, 2 fries, & 2 cans of pop for $12. Thats a great deal considering that's the price for 2 gyros, 1 fry, no pop special at nearby pizza shops. The gyros were good and better than I would have thought. The old Italian man is adorable too.

the only negative i'd say is that when i ordered a chicken parm sandwich, i heard a microwave being used in the back.. that doesnt sound too appetizing. 

CASH ONLY but their food is not anywhere near expensive."}
{"text":"Despite living right around the corner, I didn't try this place until I found the Yelp reviews on it, since it doesn't really look like much from outside.  Boy, did I find out what I was missing!  The pizza was flavorful and crispy, just like a good thin crust NY-style pizza.  Their calzone was great, too--nice and crispy and oozing with cheese and toppings (I like it with extra marinara sauce).  I see that they sell white slices for lunch, though I haven't tried one yet.  I love that they sell pizza by the slice and that their prices are inexpensive--great for single and starving grad students like me.  I seriously missed the pizza from this place over winter break.  Give it a try if you live or work around the corner--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One pizza underdone. The other overdone. Small and a little too expensive for what you get. Tried twice, and sorry, but not going back."}
{"text":"I ordered one medium pizza and they didn't charge delivery and had no minimum order requirement. Pizza was delicious and arrived quickly. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I've missed this place after all my years of working (and eating) in Oakland.  Located on N. Craig Street across from the Sunoco, Pizza Prima is a small hole in the wall delicious pizza place.  No frills, no drama, no problems.  

Here you order a base of either white or red pizza and tell them what toppings you want.  They then throw it in the pizza oven and BAM out comes thin crust pizza.  

VERY reasonably priced and options for lunch specials.  I saw on the menu some tasty looking calzones that I'll return to try in the very near future!"}
{"text":"My bf and I tried this place last night upon reading good reviews. From the outside, this place looks below average so we were surprised at the great reviews. But don't fool yoself: this joint isn't that good, it's just better than you'd expect. We would definitely order this over the Pizza Pizza across the street, but it won't be a staple for us. It was decent, but not impressive. Also our delivery driver was pissed off upon arrival because of a mixup (our roommate answered the phone and didn't know it was for us). It was 30$ with tip for two 12\" thin crust pizzas."}
{"text":"I seem to be going against the crowd here, but I found their pizza to be on the flavorless side.  I've had it a few times, trying different kinds hoping for better results.  I haven't tried their hoagies, maybe they're better."}
{"text":"A wonderfully crisp crust with a tasty sauce (not too sweet) and plentiful toppings make this one of the better pizzas I've found in Pittsburgh. If you want a quick slice, eat in, but limited space makes a sit-down meal tight."}
{"text":"My boss always bought his pizza from here and I wondered how come he (lives in a mansion on boulevard) buys his pizza from here. Today I ordered from here. This place is 5 stars in all categories. Hooked onto pizza prima. Phenomenal people serving phenomenal pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza!
I mean really great. Best pizza so far in Oakland area.

Update: the dough of the pizza made by the lady who works there (not by an old guy) was a little too thicker than I've expected."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great service!
You can tell that the pizza is made with fresh ingredients and love..."}
{"text":"I searched for a good pizza place in Westmount/NDG and this one has good reviews. We tried and are hooked! My kids loved their pizzas. I don't eat pizza much but their pizzas are the exception. It's now our favorite pizza delivery place. We have been getting their pizzas ever since. So this review is actually long overdue. 

The owners are a lovely couple and together with the staff, are very friendly. The kitchen staff are friendly too and look happy to be working there. The pizzas are thin crust and are delicious. So far our favorites are the pepperoni and the Hawaiian. So good. In fact, the minute we touched down at the airport after our summer vacation, and needed dinner on our way back home, we all decided to order pizzas from here!"}
{"text":"Laurie and George were so helpful in helping cater my college's event. They were cooperative, prompt and fair-priced, and best of all the pizza was beautiful in taste and appearance. A+"}
{"text":"The pizzeria is run by a welcoming, old Italian man. I ordered a large calzone with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage. The calzone totaled to about $16, but was MASSIVE. I could only finish half of it in one sitting. More importantly, the calzone was simple, fresh, and honest, which are the top three qualities I look for in good food.

I am looking forward to trying their pizzas in the future."}
{"text":"I have to warn you: I've asked for delivery at least 5 times from this place on Friday or Saturday night, and they've always said \"No delivery tonight.\" So don't expect delivery. Also, there are no tables - so don't expect to eat it there.

But they have great pizza, and it's cheaper than the chains. It's under $20 for 2 extra large one topping pizzas. It's also fresh pizza, and I've ordered enough pizzas to have the guys run out of cheese - so I think they buy their cheese daily too. 

I recommend trying it at least once - you won't regret it, and you probably won't order Domino's, Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Vocelli again. Unless you need delivery."}
