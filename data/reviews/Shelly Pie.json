{"text":"Not a bad pie.  I got a small pepperoni pizza. I prefer a more spicy sauce.  Theirs is mild to sweet.  There is a lot of crust, which tastes good.  You WILL get a lot of toppings!  This made for a greasy pie (pepperoni will do that).  The place seems good and the staff is good.  There is more on the menu than the pizza.  I saw folks with burgers, sandwiches and pasta.  I had my expectations too high for the pie.  See my pictures for more."}
{"text":"Great pizza a large is big so get it for like 4 people. I got take out but the place was nice and so was the staff. I plan on taking my family there for dinner."}
{"text":"We had eaten here before in the restaurant and had always been very happy. This time we booked their party room for our daughters graduation party. We could not have been any more happy with our choice, from the location to the food to the staff!  Mike (one of the owners) was nothing but patient with my daughter and I as we completed the details several days prior. The food was exactly what we had come to expect from Shelly Pie. When we walked in to complete the decorating on the day of the party, the staff had everything setup, right down to the water on the tables and the real silverware wrapped and in place. Every detail was completed and waiting for us.  Once I had a moment to settle in, I realized that Mike and Jim (one of the other owners) were in the kitchen, along with their staff, eyes deep in the prep. Once our party was started, Jim was constantly checking with his wait staff, making sure they had what they needed so that we had what we were expecting. The waitresses were outstanding, always on top of the details, yet never \"in the way\".  Again, I want to thank everyone from Shelly Pie! We received nothing but great comments about your food and service from our guests and my wife and I will recommend you folks every chance we can!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza joint with huge portions, quality food and great service! Bring your appetite and be ready for left overs. A real gem in this part of town."}
{"text":"Just as good as, if not better than,  the other place. Nice staff and reasonably priced. Even though it made my gallbladder angry for two days, I\"ll still give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome unique style pizza. If you ever had a vinnie pie from Vincents pizza on rt30 then you know what you're getting. If not make the trip to try it out. You'll be hooked! This place has the pizza from what used to be Vincents. There's none other like it. Biggest pizza with the most toppings I've seen."}
{"text":"Best garlic rolls I've ever had! We ordered a small pizza with sausage and banana peppers and it was amazing! Between the two of us, we each had a slice and a half- it was so huge but so hard to put down! Definitely my new go-to pizza spot!"}
{"text":"I got take out on a Friday night. Cajun chicken and grilled chicken sandwichs with fries.  Both were good. Other reviewers noted the noise level, yes it is noisy there when full.  Parking was tricky as you have to turn at the light by Citizens Bank then circle behind it."}
{"text":"Went there with 2 friends,got medium pie 2 waters 1 coke,over 26 bucks. 1 topping,pepperoni,was so greasy such a rip off,no one was full and half the piece was a bubbled up crust. Find a new place to take hungry people its all greasy"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. WOW!!!! Drop everything and go here. Great menu, friendly service, casual ambiance. Nice place to have a family event or a nice lunch or dinner with friends. Menu is extensive. BYOB policy. Event room perfect for small receptions. Open 7 days, lunch and dinner. Pizza, entrees, sandwiches, etc. Soup to nuts!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! This is the kind of pizza that I expect for $20. Not some chain pizza that is cheaply made and tastes like cardboard. This pizza is the real deal. This is the kind of pizza that you will need multiple napkins to eat! The dough is fresh. The sauce is perfect. The cheese is real and authentic. And the toppings are plentiful! I ordered a pepperoni pizza and this thing was LOADED with fresh sliced pepperoni. They definitely slice the pepperoni by hand because there were a few larger chunks on top of my pizza which made it that much better!!! I am a big eater and two to three pieces and I can't move. Worth every penny. Parking is confusing, as it is in the back of the restaurant. The location of the restaurant is also confusing if you have never been there or are not familiar with the area. The dining area is small and compact. But it is nice and clean. It is also BYOB which I love! I have seen people there with small coolers full of beer, bottles of wine, etc. The service is excellent. The people working there really strive to accommodate their customers and really put effort into making a quality pizza with quality ingredients. Even though I am about 45 minutes away, I will be back a few times a year when I get the craving for this pizza!"}
{"text":"Sit down visit from Chicago and we are first time visitors! This pizza and shrimp scampi was outstanding! Kudos to the chef!! We will most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food & great service. I have yet to have a bad meal here. Pizza reminds me of Vincent's but I love the way the way they make it here . Lots of other great meals and the reuben was excellent!"}
{"text":"TOP OF THE LINE WHEN IT COMES TO PIZZA! I love the toppings filled pizza, and the endless cheese! Expect a large amount of leftovers, because this pizza is filling!  I keep aluminum foil on hand, so the packaging which I find so much better than a big box works just fine for me!  I think this is my favorite pizza place.  It's a pick up or eat in type of place.  But to be honest, the pizza is so good I will go and pick it up at anytime!  Thanks Shelly for getting it right!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!!   Double up on your lipitor before ordering a large pepperoni, but Damn the heart attack is worth it!!!!  All joking aside, BYOB beer or wine is a nice feature.  Great pizza and its on of our favorites!!!"}
{"text":"In Turtle Creek, this is probably the best pizza place,  However, it's not in the top 10 pizza places in Pittsburgh or anything.  Their Shelly pie is seriously enormous. If you order pepperoni and like your pizza to actually taste like a giant piece of pepperoni and upon completion of the pizza wish to turn into a pepperoni, then order it.  If you are so/so on pepperoni, do not order it.  Most people probably wouldn't complain about too much pep - but this place puts WAY too much on their pizza.  There is never enough cheese on the pie. The crust appears to be super thick, but it's just the outer ring of the pie... in the middle, it's always incredibly way too thin that it's impossible to eat by hand. Certainly try for yourself... I believe it's one of those acquired taste type of pizza. You can tell this is a relation to Vincents pizza.  Not much of a difference."}
{"text":"This is a review of the service not the food I did not get waited on I can only sit in a booth alone so long well there's a waitress doing nothing in another waitress not with me but she was very busy I don't understand how they survive"}
{"text":"Had a piece of my neighbors pie and it was great. My sister called and said they were ordering from Shelly Pie ,I had been there several times and they never made the pie like I ordered. I thought I would give it a try again. I ordered a pie to be lightly done. When I got it even the cheese had burn marks. So I called and they said they would make another. Had to make a trip back down to pick up the re-make. I saw a pie that came out that looked good. So I thought mine would look that way also, big mistake. But it was better than the one I took back but not by much. They didn't offer anything for the incondenience but an apology. My sister doesn't complain but her's ways even worst than mine. In fact the crust was hard and the cheese was even burnt more than mine. I know it will be a long time if ever I go back."}
{"text":"Really excellent Pittsburgh-style pizza...or should I say Vinny's-style pizza?  I really like Vinny's, but love Shelly Pie.  Shelly's pizza is every bit as excellent as Vinny's, plus they have an expanded menu, and BYOB.  Vinny's has no corkage policy and doesn't permit you to bring in wine even if you offer to pay a fee.  My wife wanted a pizza party at home for some friends and Shelly's was more than accommodating having 6 pies ready at specific time with relatively short notice...all the guests raved about the pizza.  This is my go-to place for pizza in the area."}
{"text":"My first review ever... Felt I should disclose that.  I consider myself a pizza connoisseur, and in this town I've had them all. Today I feel compelled to highlight the excellent service I received today at Shelly Pie. This being my first visit after hearing good thing, I was greeted as if I was a regular. I was guided into the right pizza choice (they didn't let me order a large) by two pleasant ladies. Before I even got my food I was sold and knew I would return. I am a regular, and frequent other \"local\" establishments that many Pittsburghers will claim as their favorite pizza place, but sometimes at these \"other\" establishments they treat like you're just another order placed. I look forward to Shelly Pie growing to be in the conversation of Best Pizza in the Burgh...."}
{"text":"Shelly Pie is a favorite in our house. My boys ask for it often and lovingly refer to it as \"pizza slop\" it is cheesy and greasy but so so so yummy."}
{"text":"A very nice experience for lunch.  We shared a medium pizza -- and brought half back with us.  It has a great flavor -- the crust is delicious and the sauce is slightly sweet.  It's nice that it's hand-tossed so the crust is irregular -- some of the pie has a thin crust while other slices have a nice wide crust.  I also got my favorite: a well-done oven-baked Italian hoagie.  The hoagie could have been left in the oven for a few minutes longer but the flavor was terrific.  It was also nice to be waited on by Carly -- Shelly's niece.  What an interesting, friendly and nice young gal.  Thanks for the great food and the great service !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had searched all over Pittsburgh for the best pizza.  We found it here!! Loved the crust and amount of cheese. Definitely, can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Shellys has Wonderful pizza! This Is a must on pay day. My daughter doesn't eat any other pie then this one. My husband is addicted to it lol ! Go and find out for yourself you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got two Medium Pizzas which were very good...but I asked for Anchovies on 1 and didn't get any...was a little disappointed but other than that Great Experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and cheese ravioli. Good service and the food is great. You definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"A honest & worthwhile trip to guilty pleasure paradise!  So my amazing parents, B&B, brought me here for some guilty pleasure! Amazing pizza ...a piece is a meal!   Better than Vincent's!"}
{"text":"Shelly Pie is definitely worth the trip. Our group tried three different types of pizza and liked them all. The prices are very moderate."}
{"text":"Wow! So i went to Shelly Pie today for the first time with some people at work... When we drove into Turtle creek and saw the building that it was in (old VFW building)..I was skeptical... But went inside and the place was really nice... And really busy.... Ordered the pizza as everyone said how good it is.... I've got you say...i was impressed! Got pepperoni and sausage... It was loaded up! The sausage was definitely the best sausage I've ever had on a pizza! It was oily pizza....i think they drizzle olive oil over top of it... Didn't think i would like that, but i didn't mind it at all. They must use a light olive oil. Co workers also ordered fries... Garlic parm.... Should've seen the size of it! Was enough fries for four or five people. Will definitely be back to Shelly Pie!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and delicious! My group all had salads and shared a pizza. The salad was fresh and had plenty of vegetables. The pizza was fabulous and the waitress was so nice. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Thicker outer crust, thinner under crust. Delicious, well seasoned sauce. Plenty of cheese, wouldn't recommend extra! Steak is delicious, and the meatballs are as well (hoagies and toppings). The salads are large and they even offer family sized salads for the table! Very clean place. Looked like a municipal building on the outside, but the inside is well maintained and comfortable! Only downfall was finding it, and passing it twice before realizing where the parking was (to the right in a side lot, turn at the light after the pizza place). Handicap accessible ramp in the front, tables are a good wheelchair height. Bathrooms are handicap accessible with locking door and bars, so it's very wheelchair friendly. Would definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"This pizza creation is quintessential Pittsburgh. A perfect representation of the creativity from the hard working blue collar east coasters.   If you've never eaten at Shelly pie or Vincent's, you're doing yourself a great injustice by going else where in my humble opinion of both establishments.  Now with that being said, you will find the odd yinzer, who will tell you to avoid this pizza . . . I got into that argument at a cousins house just a few weekends ago. He said it was too greasy and \"soupy\" hard to eat Etc Etc...    And my response was simple. If you can have enough self control to let the pizza cool down for about 5 min or so, it gets much easier to dish out and cut.. I know that is an incredibly hard thing to do, because the sight of one in front of you is just too exciting, and you wanna dive right in. But just like with any good pizza, you will most likely end up with a little grease or cheese drippings on you , so maybe wear an old T-shirt or something, no one cares its very casual and laid back   I love Shelly pie. I live over an hour away, but will make the trek into turtle creek again in the very near future for my Pittsburgh classic . Gotta wash it  \"Dahn\" with some turners iced tea too! Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"They changed something,  pizza was terrible.  The sausage was not the same,  crust was not the same. I will go back to Vincent's. They have to go back to original,  or they may lose a lot of customers."}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of Shelly Pie.  Its not just pizza!  The greens and beans are delicious.  The polenta was amazing.  The pizza is the big, thick crust type with lots of cheese.   The restaurant is clean and waitstaff is friendly.  If you've never been, its worth a try!  Family friendly!"}
{"text":"So the family and I were in the car trying to figure out where to eat and my wife says Let's try Shelly Pie. So we made our way there. I had heard a lot about this once VFW hall turned Pizza restaurant so we were excited to see what all the hype was about. Upon arriving the parking lot confused me as you have to enter of the street in the rear.  As we walked in I was pleasant surprised as the space is open and very modern compared to the building's exterior.  I must say that this placed reminded me of Gateway Grill and Rivertowne Pour House in Monroeville. It was pretty loud too. They do have several flat screen TVs to catch a game though.    Once inside we seated ourselves and were greeted by Patty. She was very funny as we told her it was our first time there. A couple minutes later our waitress Sara C came and took our drink orders.   For our appetizer we went with the fried Zucchini Planks. You get six to an order and they come with either ranch dressing or marinara sauce. They were very, very good.  For our entrees my wife and I both went with ShellZones (Shelly's version of the calzone) For topping my wife got pepperoni, cappicola ham, banana peppers and mushrooms and I got steak, bacon and mushrooms. Our daughter got the 1/2 pound angus burger with American cheese, grilled onions, bacon, lettuce and tomato with a side of fries. Looking at other meals being served while we were waited for ours I must say that their portions are pretty huge for the price.  Our daughters burger arrived first so she dug in. I did try a couple of her fries and I must say they were very good.  A few minutes later our calzones came, but mine was wrong. Mine came filled with steak, mushrooms and banana peppers instead of being filled with what I had ordered. I had our waitress take it back and have a corrected calzone made. Not to mention they gave me my same marinara sauce that came with the first calzone and by then it was ice cold so I had to flag the waitress down to bring me fresh and hot marinara sauce.   By the time my corrected calzone and hot marinara sauce came my wife and daughter were done and pretty much ready to go so I only ate a couple of small pieces and had the rest wrapped to go. What I did taste was delicious though.   It wasn't our waitresses fault as she took down the right calzone toppings as it was notated correctly on our check when we paid. She did take the drinks off our bill which was better than nothing...."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Shelly Pie at least 50 times since they opened and have never had a bad meal.  The place is spotless, the staff friendly, the prices reasonable and the food delicious.  BYOB in the dining room.  Take out orders are ready when they say they will be and have always includes the necessities.  Try the specials, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"I grew up in New Jersey and have eaten TONS of pizza from both NJ and NYC. I have heard people say this area is the mecca of pizza, where good pizza comes from etc. Now although NJ will always hold a special place in my heart...pizza from nj nyc is straight DOO DOO compared to Pittsburgh. I thought i knew what good pizza was, until i moved to Pittsburgh. I went on a small pizza mission when I first moved here trying all the local pizza spots and let me tell you.. Pizza in Pittsburgh blew my pants off. The pizza at Shelley Pie is so big, its like a monster pizza ate all the other weaker pizzas and formed a giant super pizza dripping with a hundred pounds of cheese mad toppings and love. The pizzas here are so gigantic if you tried to lift the pizza it would collapse in the center.  I went into a pizza/carb coma after attempting to eat Shelley Pie and it was totes worth it."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Great prices. Atmosphere is lacking. Service is good some days. No gluten free here. Best when it's hot."}
{"text":"Travelling often from Philly to Cleveland, we are THRILLED to find this gem in Turtle Creek!  The food, the owners, and staff at Shelly Pie are excellent! The prices are very reasonable.... especially when their small pizza is the size of the LARGE pizza we order in Philly!  The freshness of the food (freshly made Ranch dressing, made with buttermilk), and the creative combinations of their specials make it a gastro-delicious experience!  Can't wait for the next trip!"}
{"text":"tried this pizza a month ago was the worst i have ever had. the sauce was ok. the crust was flavorless and not consistent thickness. the cheese was like rubber. first pizza of any kind that i have thrown away in my life."}
{"text":"Great pie, great stuffed peppers, great service and very cool location!  Pizza was just as good the next day after a reheat!  Beer would be nice, but I'm fine with a more family vibe.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This pizza was great. If you like a lot of toppings and a crust that you can basically eat as another sandwich, this is the pizza for you."}
{"text":"Very quiet around noon, which I thought would have been a bad thing. But once I walked past customers who had food in front of them, I knew this was a great idea.  It's really easy to miss, for such a large building, but I'm really glad we stopped. The pizza was fantastic! Thin crust, crunchy but with good texture. A proper helping of toppings, so it's well worth every penny. Be sure to eat it hot because it's not the best cold. Some of the better Pizza I've eaten. I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Another good quality and excellent service, meal at Shelly's. Went for my Birthday meal loved Shelly's pizza last time I was here and couldn't stop thinking about it so I had to make the return. And it didn't disappoint keep doing what your doing. Would recommend"}
{"text":"This has truly become one of my favorite places to eat.   The atmosphere is great: lots of TVs, very well lit, awesome pictures of Pittsburgh from back in the day, great lighting, and best of all, the staff is very friendly and provides great service!  But absolutely the best thing about this place is the food! The quality is outstanding and you get so much with each portion ordered. You can tell the owners of this place are truly Italian. I have been here several times & everything I have ordered has been absolutely delicious! The pizzas are huge & packed with toppings. The stromboli -- wow -- LOL big and packed with goodness! Most likely you will have leftovers to take home with you. Oh, and you have to try the wedding soup -- mmmm, so delicious!  One thing to note, they do not sell alcohol. You can BYOB if you would like. I have to be honest, I like this aspect because it adds to be family atmosphere.  Give \"Shelly Pie\" a try!"}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at Shelly pie. We shared the large antipasto and had a pepperoni pizza done to perfection! Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Went a distance to get here as its been compared to Vincents vinnie pie and had to see how it shapes up.  Well first crust very much the same. Cheese same great taste, pepporni was plenty of it and also great. Saugage there was not as much but actually tasted better!  Not near the grease level. Excellent and while a shade under vinnies they have the advantage of being open week day afternoons and they take credit cards... So new favorite Pizza.  An added plus a big menu too and there garlic knots are super."}
{"text":"SHELLY PIE!!! The real deal! The pizza is AWESOME, DELICIOUS, FRESH and the restaurant is very nice and clean! The staff is friendly and personable!!  This is almost as important as the food and I think these people understand that!! So many restaurants need to take a lesson!!  Keep it up SHELLY PIE!!   I would just like to mention that. I grew up going to Vincent's Pizza Park. It was like no other pizza, that is a fact.... As others have noted, it was sad when they closed. We all waited as they worked in the building and finally reopened. The pizza was BACK!! I have been there about 5 times since it reopened. It was good. BUT I FOUND SHELLEY PIE and I prefer it over Vincent's. I found it while I was driving past the former VFW where Shelly Pie is and I saw someone walking out with a pizza wrapped in butcher block paper on cardboard.... I quickly looked it up and had to try it!!! We get it once a week!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious! The crust is thick and soft and a couple slices will fill you up. Very greasy, but still has the taste of handmade ingredients. It's pricey but a large will definitely feed about 6 people so certainly worth it! If you're driving here there is parking around back but it's easy to miss in the dark so just be sure to look carefully, they are eat in and carry out only. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place and their pies are a chip off the old Vincents block. Come hungry and worthwhile ordering a size down from what you would normally order any where else, as their large pizza size is everyone else's Ginormous! One of pizzas brought to the table, for someone in our party, arrived burnt and felt that it should have been comped as they had to wait quite a while for their replacement pizza after everyone else in our group was well tucked into their own food.  Appetizers were great too especially the zucchini and also  broccoli cheese bites. (The marinara sauce is wonderful).  Have been to Shelly pies many times ...love the food... but my biggest gripe is the parking lot... So please, please, pretty please Shelly Pies do something about your awful parking lot. It's really no fun having to drive through potholes that rival no man's land during the battle of the Somme!!"}
{"text":"Visited today with my daughter. Based on the outside of the building, I was very surprised with the inside and the way the restaurant was decorated, it looked very nice. I also loved the fact that there is an adequate amount of booths. The bathroom was also very clean. We came about 4 pm for dinner. The place was fairly empty and a server was over promptly after we sat. After looking at the menu i found it to be just a tad more expensive than I had expected. We ordered a large one topping. The pizza was 15 and the topping was 4. The pizza was a decently big size, lots of cheese and thick crusted. The pepperoni was a bit oily but overall okay. It reminded me alot of Vincent's pizza. My only complaint is the server wasn't too great with bringing refills."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2.5 stars because I'm just not a huge fan of their pizza. It tasted ok but didn't make me feel well for a day or two. I like it when pizza isn't sloppy. I felt that it could have been crafted in a better manner.   If you're a fan of huge pizza portions and lots of cheese, then this is your place. Just not for me. Updated a previous post to be fair to the owners. Wish them luck. Turtle Creek doesn't have much going on so this place should dominate the area."}
{"text":"Not really sure what to say here.... \"Urghhh\" basically sums it up. You'll see... Give it a try - just not sure you'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it, I'm late to the game in trying Shelly Pie. I'm a diehard old fan of the Vinnie pie, and had my first pizza at Vincent's Pizza Park several decades ago. Fast forward to 2017. Vincent, god rest his soul, is gone. Vincent's Pizza Park is pretty darned good but not quite the same, and now we've heard that upstart Shelly Pie has been operating for a few years down the street with a competitive product. This demands an investigation. Well I did my due diligence. I visited Shelly pie and ordered a pizza, and even brought the leftover home for a midnight snack, breakfast and lunch the next day. I proudly proclaim Shelly Pie as the second best pizza ever to grace the Three Rivers region, the first being the late Vincent Chianese. Ok, Vinny's gone, so the mantle goes to -ta da-, Shelly Pie. With Vincent's Pizza Park closely behind.  Shelly Pie's pizza isn't quite perfect - yet - but it's darned good. The decor is far nicer than Vincent's (remember the fake plastic grapes and lights hanging from the ceiling in the old VPP? Can you say fire hazard?), but minus 2 points for a small imbalance in the salt in the crust. I don't like a lot of salt but even I felt that it came up short in that department, a bit bland. But the sausage was awesome! Rich sausage taste, punctuated with hot pepper and fennel... Mmmm. And Shelly Pie has the same great \"sauce\" on the pizza pan rendered from the sausage and veggies you choose, and you WILL dip crust pieces in this sauce and eat them or you're never coming back. THUMBS UP, Shelly Pie, you folks ROCK, and I will be back and next time I will bring my friends!"}
{"text":"A few people from work said to try the best Pizza in the city... they were very right!!!  wow, the sauce and cheese is amazing, the dough ... yummy!!  and shall i say HUGE."}
{"text":"Good pizza friendly reasonable prices friendly staff . get there early gets crowded. You can also order the pizza to go.  They do sell alcohol but you can bring your own wine or beer."}
{"text":"I never had anything that did not taste amazing here. I reccomend this place to all. Amazing food, and a great staff."}
{"text":"Usually very good but this place is hit or miss with the freshness of their dough. Two out of Six times I have gotten a bad pie to the point where I though I was going to chip a tooth on the crust. Anyone who ever worked in a pizza place can tell when dough is not fresh or over proofed. Sometimes it dries out on top and creates a pudding skin type effect on the raw dough. They roll it out anyway and think that by putting the hard pieces on bottom that it will change when cooked. It does change to the point of having little oyster cracker shaped hard bits all over the bottom of your pie. One time they were as hard as pieces of eggshell.  In my opinion this is not satisfactory when you are play 12 plus dollars for some bread and cheese. The last one I got had an over proofed crust made out of old dough and did not taste anything like what it normally does. I will give it another try but I hope someone who works there reads this and makes some changes and addresses these problems. If it keeps happening I am going to have to start going to Vincents."}
{"text":"What a great new spot. Odd location, as you can throw a rock and hit three other pizza places. Follow your GPS, especially at night, as this place sits back off the road and the sign out front is not lit. Parking is on the right side of the building. We tried this spot on a Sunday evening when we just couldn't stand another chain pizza and heard this spot opened up. The \"pies\" are delicious, but let me start front the beginning.  After calling in our order for pick up (pepperoni & mushrooms w/ bacon on half) I circled the block a couple times not really trusting my GPS that this big dark building with one porch light and no signs could be where my pizza was. I parked and gave it a try. Sure enough, once about 10 ft from the door, I could make out the unlit sign. I walked in to many booths and a sign that stated to \"seat yourself.\" I wasn't eating there so I began to wander around looking for the counter/checkout. I found a small register at the end of a counter oddly forcing the line next to the patrons sitting at their booths. While I waited, a few customers came in the side door \"looking for some place called Shelly's Pies.\" I felt better that I was not the only lost soul. As I waited for my turn in line, I wondered what my total would be as my wife saw the menu and no total was discussed when she placed the order. Once helped, the total for a \"large\" 2.5 topping pizza was $22! I have to admit I was shocked to hear anything over 20 and was hoping for less... But wait! Please read on! I still had not actually seen my pizza... I was handed a pizza on flimsy cardboard wrapped and stapled in butcher paper. Not a welcome sit considering the distance back to my vehicle. You can imagine my thoughts once back in my car... 'This better be the best pizza I've ever had' and 'I know you're new, but too cheap for a real pizza box?' NOW, once I got home and my wife unwrapped the pizza... All became clear. They can't use a pizza box because it's too enormous! It would never fit in any pizza box I have ever seen. And the price was totally fair considering there was at least a pound of pepperoni on this pizza. The mushrooms where also plenty and the bacon was so sense you could barely see the other toppings below! This pizza would have easily fed 6-8 adults, maybe more!  All in all, we plan to return, and often. Next time for a \"small\" pizza. As a new business, they will work out the minor things quickly, like signage, parking, checkout placement, and the old patrons of the previous business at that location (VFW) coming in to \"check it out\" & \"shoot the breeze.\" Well done Shelly & team. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  Just opened and believe me you have to try it.  We ordered the stuffed banana peppers and they were truly the Best I have ever had. The greens and beans were so awesome the absolute best. I could have been satisfied but we ordered the pizza and the awesome review continues because it was incredibly good. The crust had a little crunch and the toppings were plentiful. The menu is wonderful it has just about everything on it from appetizers to full dinners.  The building is the old VFW in Turtle Creek and they remodeled with a fresh new look. This restaurant won't be the best kept secret for long. Oh and a bonus BYOB!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service was great!  My husband and I shared a delicious antipasto salad!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza to share.  I had high hopes because of rave reviews I have heard and read and was disappointed in the pizza.  I felt like it was very bland, greasy and lacked enough cheese."}
{"text":"Great service, pizza & stuffed banana peppers.  Shelley pie was also very affordable that is a recipe for success. I am now a customer for life."}
{"text":"So, I needed to find a place to take lunch into a local business and found this place to be closest and not a chain.  I try to support small biz as much as possible.  I needed to to feed 10-12 people and ordered 3 large pies.  I was not aware that they did not put the pies in boxes, rather they just staples paper onto cardboard.  It was quite the challenge to transport.  Nevertheless, I managed to get to my meeting and a few people asked if this was from another shop up the street.  I told them no, it's Shelly Pie.  The pies were fantastic, bacon and pepperoni on one, black olive and green peppers on the second, and white pizza with tomato and ricotta.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"was there last night great food pizza and wings were good highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered two pies for a work party my coworkers couldn't stop talking about and eating these pies ALWAYS excellent and very nice people at Shelly Pie"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for trying pizza somewhere off the beaten path (at least for us), so after a quick search, we were on our way to Shelly Pie in Turtle Creek.  Shelly Pie is a sit-down pizza restaurant (though they also serve things other than pizza). It has a warm and welcoming vibe...most of the people there seemed to be locals. It was very clean, bright, and had lots of TVs. Our server couldn't have been nicer and was very attentive.  We opted to keep things very basic and ordered provolone sticks for an appetizer and a medium cheese pizza for dinner. The provolone sticks arrived in short order and were delicious....fried to perfection and appropriately gooey. The best part of the sticks was the marinara sauce they were served with....super flavorful! Most dipping sauces are bland and generic, but this actually had chunks of tomato and lots of visible spices. It was so good that we actually ate the rest with a spoon when we ran out of provolone sticks (don't judge).   After we were done with our appetizer, it took a REALLY long time for our pizza to come out. I mean....we're talking probably 45 minutes? Our waiter was really apologetic and kept saying....\"It should be out soon...how long could it possibly take to make a cheese pizza?!\" (Our thoughts exactly!) At one point he even offered to bring us out some bread to nosh on, which we declined since our appetizer had taken the edge off of our hunger, but we appreciated his concern. So the service was great! But hopefully 45 minutes for a cheese pizza is not the norm and we were just there when they were having an off night in the kitchen....because that's definitely too long to wait for something so simple!  When our pizza finally arrived, we eagerly dug in and weren't disappointed. The crust was thick and chewy....pretty unique from other Pittsburgh shops. They also go CRAZY on the cheese....it's super gooey and heavy, so you'll definitely want to sop up some of the extra grease with a napkin before digging in (or I guess maybe not, depending on your feelings about grease, haha). Overall, it was a really tasty pizza. My only complaint was that it was a little sparse on the sauce.....their sauce is delicious, and I found myself wishing the pizza had more to balance out the extra cheese and thick crust. However, that was easily solved by asking our waiter for some extra sauce on the side, which he happily brought. And next time I'll ask for the pizza to be extra saucy!   Long pizza wait time aside, we were very pleased with the food and service, so even though this isn't exactly around the corner from us, it's certainly worth making the drive again to partake in this deliciously unique pizza!"}
{"text":"Perogie Lasagna is wonderful!  Large portion, very filling with tons of butter.   If you are crazy about pirogies like me, yet somehow can never figure out how to spell the word correctly, you will love this. By the way, who cares how to spell it  Oh cannot finish the portion because it's too big. Served with side of sour cream and also served with onions on top. I needed to add a little salt but was in heaven with this comfort food!!! Thank u team Shellie.  By the way, the place is nice and simple. I love the tribute on the wall as u walk in - dedicating the former VFW location to all who served (printed on a poster with the flag as background). You cannot miss this when u walk in   Next time I'm taking my own bottle of wine. The byob policy is right in the menu - see pic attached."}
{"text":"this place is alright.  big face pizzas to say the least. like a vinny pie but not wack like a vinny pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in Pittsburgh. The wedding soup and stuffed hot peppers are wonderful. I highly recommend visiting this place. They do not have a liquor license. It is BYOB. They do have a separate room that holds about 50 for meetings etc."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Ive been a fan of Vincents Pizza for 40+ years however their quality has gone down lately and Shelly Pie has become my new favorite Pizza place."}
{"text":"I'd eat here more frequently if my waistline would allow it! Favorite pizza in the area!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this isn't my favorite style of pizza I'm giving it 5 Stars. It deserves more. Let me also be clear that I've never met Shelly and this is in no way a reflection of the woman.   But, oh that pie...  This is the kind of pie you come across late at night and can't believe she's from your town. That's probably because she's not the perfect beauty that everyone shares on their Facebook page. There is nothing about her that conforms with society's normal conventions of beauty. But she is gorgeous, and irresistible. You get a glance of this voluptuous goddess and catch one whiff of her sweet/savory scent and are instantly in love. Or lust? I never can tell.   You take her home and there's just so much to her that you wonder how you can handle it. There's no way you can just dig in without making a huge gooey mess. The discipline to go get a fork and knife and a plate are necessary, but you can't wait... You cannot help but dive right in. And it's everything you've imagined that it could be. It's so damn messy, but the flavor dripping down your chin is heaven and you no longer have the ability to care about how dirty you get.     After finishing that first piece, you shouldn't go back for more. But you do, because you can't help yourself--- and you keep going back until you physically are unable to take another bite.   Now, here's the great thing: your Shelly Pie be there tomorrow! Oh, you won't start off the day with a slice. No, you're too good for that. You'll decide to be the good little scout and choose something a little more \"nutritious.\" Something that you won't be ashamed to be seen with if your family drops in unexpectedly.   But she's still there, and all day you can't stop thinking about her.   So later that night, when you can't control yourself any longer, you call to her and she's instantly there for you: in all her heavy, tasty, thick, luscious decadence. Within minutes, she's hot and steamy, you light headed and hungry, and it begins all over again. Just like the night before when you brought her home; you can't get enough, you go back for more and more until you're so ecstatic and fulfilled that you pass out in a love-drunk haze thinking of nothing but Shelly Pie.  **************************************************  Post-Script:  Life is beautiful. Life is sweet. But the laws of physics say that what goes up, must come down and likewise the calendar says that work week eventually comes back around. You valiantly go about your business with only limited daydreaming of your crazy weekend.   The clock spins 'round, it's dark and you've done your time.  So you get out the door, it's late Monday night, and then it hits you in the face like Sonny Liston wearing brass knuckles:   Shelly Pie closes at 10 PM!    You'll be going home alone.   But that's ok. Because if you had Shelly Pie every day, you'd be dead within a year."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how great the food is here. The best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you were a fan of the now defunct Vincent's pizza, grieve no more. Shelly is making pies that are even better. The dough is AMAZING.    I started with stuffed banana peppers and garlic knots. This would have be enough! Very big portions.  I also has a medium pizza - I  planed on leftovers. Out standing. I got an all vegetable pie. Everything was great.   There is also a full - and I mean full -  menu, but make sure you try the pizza!"}
{"text":"This was a great pizza place! Unfortunately, when I went it was on a Sunday. This was unfortunate because 3x my husband tried to Order something and they were out. Then I tried to Order the Ruben and they were out of bread. However, they gave us free pepperoni fries to make up for it. Their potatoe skins were so delicious that even though the waitress didn't bring the sour cream we ate them all before we even noticed which my daughter thought was hillarious. The pizza was huge and so delicious!!! I recommend you try it, but don't bother going on Sundays."}
{"text":"Last night we had a surprise birthday party for my Mom in Shelly Pie's Hayward Jackson room.  Everything about the party was amazing!  The room was set up beautifully.  We had the pizza buffet with appetizers (hot banana peppers and wings).  It was absolutely delicious and there was plenty of food for all of our guests.   They used nice plates and silverware and really made it nice  for us.  Our friends and family who have not been here raved about how great the pizza was!  Our waitress, Gina, was very efficient, sweet, and accommodating.  When preparing for the party, Shelly and the other owners were kind and accommodating.  I would highly recommend Shelly Pie's Restaurant for a party or just to go get a pizza!  Thanks for everything, Shelly, Gina and the Shelly Pie team!  Gina Rudolph"}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly staff, really wonderful food and nice atmosphere. One of our favorite spots. Also love the BYOB!"}
{"text":"Sit down visit #2.  The place was jumping, dining room almost full.  Reminder:  BYOB  Starters:  Garlic knots - I will never deny myself these pieces of heaven.  We also had the zucchini, which was also quite good.  Dinners:  I had the chicken piccata and it was really good - enough to feed two people, easily.  Hubs had the tuna noodle casserole, which he declared wonderful and could not finish.  Friends ordered the antipasto to share and were super happy - it looked great.  They also had the Italian hoagie - the bread had a lovely crunch on the outside and a soft inside.  We didn't ask if they bake their own bread, but speculated that they did...    Now for the star of the evening:  Calzone.  I mean CALZONE!  It was big; a beautiful work of edible art.  Easily enough for three people.  Golden brown and Friends confirmed: as beautiful on the inside as it was on the outside!  We left with bags of future lunches.  Service was attentive, quick and engaging.  It was a perfect end to a perfect weekend.  Thanks Shelly Pie!"}
{"text":"Shelly's pies are the best!  If you loved Vincent's, you'll love hers even more.  Shelly holds the secret recipe and has improved it.  Great atmosphere and great food.  Try the polenta with marinara and the garlic knots.  Save that garlicy butter to dip your pizza bones into!"}
{"text":"Stopped here VERY randomly on a road trip and could not have left happier. The pizza was great, you could see the attention given to the whole pie, and everything was top notch. We had no idea where we were when driving into Turtle Creek haha, but left feeling like we had comfortably known the staff for years. Hope to make it back some day and do it all again!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza, dislike the service. For the second time in a row, received poor service - this time in terms of food delivery, the time before it took forever to get the bill - and ended up walking out. How hard can it be for a pizza shop to make two pizzas for a table and deliver them together? But no...let's space them 20+ minutes apart, so the first is cold before the second comes. Being polite requires one to wait so all can eat, but it's apparently more important for the staff to sit around a table talking and counting tips (witnessed) than getting food delivered correctly. Then you can grab a wrapped pizza that's been sitting on the shelf, take the paper off, and try to pass it off to your customer. Frustrating.  I think I'll go back to Vincents...Shelly will get my business no more."}
{"text":"The pizza was huge, had a great taste and was loaded with pepperoni & FRESH mushrooms, which deserves 5 stars cause lots of places use canned mushrooms. Service was great and it is BYOB, next time we will bring beer"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered a black olive and sauteed banana pepper pizza. The pizza was huge for a medium and had a ton of toppings on it. The banana peppers were spicier than I expected but pizza tasted great. However, the crust wasn't as tasty as I was hoping it would be.  The employees at the restaurant were all friendly and helpful, since it was my first time there. The place was busy, but even so the service was quick and professional."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on Saturday, June 8; and although the parking can be a bit 'challenging' behind the old VFW in Turtle Creek, where Shelly Pie is located, due to the ongoing bridgework right next door, this place is well worth the effort.  The decor is pretty simple, but is very clean, and we were greeted and seated right away, a big plus.  It wasn't very crowded, but it was pretty early on a Saturday afternoon, so that wasn't unexpected.  My wife and I both ordered off the specials menu - my wife getting what  I believe was a cajun chicken dish, and I got chicken and veggies over biscuits with gravy and mashed potatoes.  We also got the wedding soup, which was AMAZIING!  Too many place over-salt their soups, but Shelly's nailed it.  The entrees were great, too; and nothing was overpriced.  Service was excellent, without being cloying, and the waitress was very personable.  The pizzas we saw looked huge, and I believe that might be our next adventure on our next visit, which will be soon.  And although i didn't get to order one of their italian dishes, I did see a bowl of ravioli that looked suspiciously like a serving bowl that could serve a half dozen people.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem  It has such a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and (obviously) delicious pizza!!! If you love pizza with toppings piled on, look no further  I recommend pepperoni, bacon, and banana peppers."}
{"text":"I would not order anything except the pizza, not because the other menu items are not appealing,  but the pizza was just that good.  This place is a must try for pizza in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh.   The environment inside was not bad either.   We caught the 1 o'clock nfl games and had a couple of pies , this made for an enjoyable afternoon."}
{"text":"My friend insisted on ordering from Shelly Pie saying it was the best pizza around. I have to say that this pizza just was not to my liking. It was very greasy, the dough was uneven, but I loved all the cheese. Some people swear by this place though, I just am not one of them.  The dough was extremely thick on the edges which I enjoyed, but it just fell apart in the middle where the dough was paper thin. The pools of grease gathered over the paper thin center making it fall apart even more.      Unless I'm in a bowling alley I do not expect my pizza to be that greasy. Any time you have to clean the top of the pizza with multiple paper towels, you can't help but be skeptical of the pizza quality. But again that cheese was the closest thing to a redeeming quality that I could find. Liberally spread across the surface it was cheese heaven, although it started to harden up quicker than most.  The other thing I didn't like particularly, granted it is minor, was the shape of the pie. It isn't really circular or particularly close to it. Maybe some people like the very long shape of the pie, my friend thought it made it unique. To me it looked lazy, although me not liking the pizza was probably a factor in that opinion.   I really did want to like this Pizza as I really love supporting small local businesses, but I will not be ordering from Shelly Pie again. A lot of people really love it and I hear the building is the old VFW and looks very nice. I wish the best to Shelly Pie but you won't find me there any time soon."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza. To keep it short, my only problem is the pizzas are never the same. It's not a bad thing, but when you get the ones that have too much grease, little bummer."}
{"text":"Sitting area/restaurant area was nice and spacious for a pizza shop. The pizza is big and very tasty. A tad bit too much flour on the bottom."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  And a wonderful restaurant.  Bravo to this establishment for setting down roots in Turtle Creek.  From Pizza to Pasta to everything else,  Shelly Farren and her team have it nailed."}
{"text":"So I grew up as you can say cutting my pizza teeth on Vincent's in Forest Hills.  Being so fortunate was both a blessing and a curse as no pizza can live up to the lofty standards set by the Vinnie Pie Master and Creator himself.    As I grew older I learned to quite frankly not like pizza because none of it ever was as good as a Vinnie Pie. As I moved through life and my 20s and now into my 30s I have gotten to a point where I can tolerate most pizza and even kind of like Chicago staples like Geno's East but still none can hold a pie cutter to Vincent's.   As the issues at Vincent's came about and closure it was a sad day in my life and I can say many other Vincent Pizza Park fans.  Then magically Shelly Pie signs appeared at the old VFW in Turtle Creek and after opening we decided to try it  ... HOLY SMOKES did they knock it out of the park here.   Its like they took took a Vinnie Pie, fine tuned the process, and came out with WHAM the best pizza ever!  Crisper crust, high quality ingredients, clean experience and you have the finest pizza in the land.  Even after Vincent's has reopened I find myself dialing the Shelly Pie number instead.   While my heart will always belong to Vincent's, Shelly Pie has my taste buds."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza if you dig mounds of tasty toppings and cheese. I'm a big pizza fan and this is a winner. It's a little messy but so worth the napkins to eat it. The sausage was very good as was the mushroom pie as well. It's out of my way but I think it would be worth the drive ."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this past Saturday. Ordered large salad for 4 and a large mushroom and pepperoni pizza. The salad came out on a large tray and there was more than enough. Just wish there was more tomato and cucumber on it. The pizza was totally loaded with toppings. No skimping there. It was delicious. Service was very good and the place was very clean. Will definitely go back there"}
