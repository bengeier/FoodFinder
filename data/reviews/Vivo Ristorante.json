{"text":"We checked out Vivo, a semi-new Italian restaurant in Parma this weekend and loved it. It has a cool atmosphere with an open kitchen to watch the action from the large bar. There was a wait but it was worth it! We started at the bar, and decided to stay put even when our table became available, because the bartender Jim took such great care of us! The food was outstanding. We started with Arancini (risotto balls), which were half-priced at happy hour time, and made them an incredible deal. They were delicious, as was the accompanying marinara and pesto drizzle. I had the Gnocchi Rosa (minus the sausage, since I'm vegetarian) and he had the Pistachio Crusted Grouper. Both were very generous portions, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful. By the way, there were plenty of vegetarian options and I'll be back to work my way through them!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time, we just moved to this area. What a find!! Beautiful, relaxing atmosphere. We got seated right away. Our waiter, Phil, was very attentive from the start, recommended a wonderful wine & was very knowledgeable & helpful in recommending our wonderful meal. We really appreciate good service & he was great! The food was some of the \"best\" Italian food we have had in many years. We started with the calamari, the most tender I have ever had. Highly recommend the rigatoni, yummy! This is our new favorite place to eat!! Will be back very soon..."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant since they first opened. My last visit was disappointing, first off we either had to  wait or sit at the bar even though (2) tables were open for four not  two. After ordering and eating our meal in which the food was average we received our bill with (2) extra charges for requesting meat sauce or less chunky marinara sauce as well as green beans instead of spaghetti. After asking the Bar tender waitress why she didn't mention this in the first place she replied that is the policy the owner just started. If you want a better meal and less \"Nickel and Dimming\" check out Pizzeria Cerino Broadview North of Pleasant Valley rd.

{"text":"Huge portions, delicious food. Service was sub-par, and food took an eternity (greater than 60 minutes after appetizers were served for entrees for party of 4 in a half full restaurant), but would return just the same."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant!  Atmosphere & food as close to perfect as it can get.
Pricing is fair for the portion size.Tommy has another winner!"}
{"text":"I think this is a  wonderful and versatile restaurant! I now put Vivo on my local favorites list. Lovely ambiance, genuine service and very tasty food! We like to take our out of town visitors here AND order take out on nights in with the kids."}
{"text":"Very Very good!! food has been exceptional all 3 times ive been there.  Fair prices, god service accompanied with a nice atmosphere.  It is a great place."}
{"text":"Went to Scottdale for the first time this past week, and we found great authentic Italian food, with great service from our server Luciano.....bravo and thank you for an outstanding meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"A great experience all around! I had the petrale sole w/ lobster ravioli - AMAZING. Everyone at my table was thrilled with their meals. Very generous portions. Great wine selection to complement the exquisite food. If you don't see something on the menu, just ask and they'll most likely accommodate you. The food, service, everything was spot on! I will definitely be back again. Thanks VIVO for making this such a great experience!"}
{"text":"So friendly! Never have I felt more welcome in a restaurant, especially for my first time there. I was in town and just wanted to have a nice pizza, thankfully l stumbled upon Vivo! 

Not only did I get a very good Italian style sausage pizza (tasted like it was straight from Italy), every staff member from the hostess to the bartender made me want to stay instead of take it back to my hotel. 

Very good atmosphere as well, wish there was one where I live!!"}
{"text":"This review is very late (we ate there 12-31-14), but I felt compelled to comment since I saw it listed as a \"hot\" new restaurant on Eater.com, which is a sight I typically trust.  It is not \"hot\" nor is it good. 

One giveaway that it's probably not so great is when you leave Sumo Maya's standing room only crowd and walk next door to Vivo and the dining room is half empty.  But, we gave it a shot anyway.  

First, the service was a incomprehensibly poor.  We waiting at least 10 minutes to be greeted once sat and another table next to us just laughed along with us because they had arrived before us and were also still waiting.  Once I got up and asked the host where our server was, someone came over and took a drink order.  (At a really good restaurant, that host would simply come over and take the drink order immediately, not search for the server). We finally ordered drinks, and those took another 10 minutes.  Service-wise it got slightly better from there, but then the food came.  

Again, it was six months ago, but I remember one of us got the butternut squash pasta.  It tasted like some pre-made sauce had been applied and the pasta texture was just weird.  I also remember neither of us finished our meals and I believe we told the server the pasta was not good.  We received not comps on the bill.  Stay away from this joint."}
{"text":"I am not normally a big Italian food fan but VIVO is excellent.  Very authentic, pleasant atmosphere and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The food is the only reason I gave them 2 stars.  I went in on a Wednesday, hours 4p-9p.  Now granted I showed up at 8:05p but there was only two other tables occupied.  Immediately, I mean within 5 seconds of walking in the door, I was greeted with, \"Do you know we close at 9.\"  For a second I thought well apparently they clearly do not want my business this late at night.  The only reason I stayed was to utilize a Living Social voucher I purchased.  So myself and my date ordered drinks and while we enjoyed the complimentary stale bread, the person the greeted us so very nice at the door, continued to stare at us until I mentioned something to her.  The entire time I was rushed by the thought that if I didn't get out by 9p, I would feel the wrath of the person that greeted us.  The entrée was brought to us before we were finished with our house salads and boxes were offered before our forks were down.  While paying for bill I thought, shit, I better chug this beer before I get booted.  Good food, nice bar area, aweful décor, aweful service if you go \"in too late\".  Took me weeks to go there took them 5 seconds to have me never go back........"}
{"text":"10/10/2015 invited friends to eat with us at Vivo. The service was terrible and the restaurant was not crowded. They brought 2 entrees out and we waited 5 minutes for the other 2 to arrive, no excuse. 2 stars for a frustrating evening."}
{"text":"This place was authentic Italian food, so authentic that no one we spoke to understood English. We ordered a pizza with a side of ranch. The waiter did not understand when I said ranch, and my request was ignored. Ordered salads and a pasta dish. The pizza was a good portion size which is why I give the place two stars. The pasta was a smaller size so we requested another salad to accompany it, the guy did not understand us when we asked for another salad, he kept pointing to the salt and saying \"salt\" and we kept saying no salad, we had to point to a salad and say \"salad\". The service was very slow. It took about 15-20 minutes to have anyone take our order. A table was seated about 10 minutes after ours and the waiter went there first. There was so much confusion at the tables and there were only 3 other tables, so it was not like the place was packed. It took another 40-45 minutes for our food to come out. The food was good, but they definitely need work on the service."}
{"text":"Lovely evening at Vivo. We brought our out of town guests to Sumo Maya and it was pacoed, loud, and had an hour wait. Disappointed, we asked for a recommendation nearby. Vivo was such a better option! Excellent service! Delicious wine and cuisine!  We had calamari and cioppino ( sp?) Angel hair pasta with scallops, mussels and more delicious seafood! We asked for red sauce on the side since we like more sauce.  The staff was extremely accommodating. Wonderful experience! We will return! Cappuccino was the perfect touch to round out the night. Next time...dessert! Delicious!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  From start to finish, the entire experience was amazing.  The ambiance, the waiter, the chef, and the food - First class experience.  We ordered the calamari appetizer - done to perfection.  I ordered the linguine with clams & he ordered one of their wood fired pizzas.  Again, both entrees were done to perfection.  Portion sizes are quite generous, but you must save room for dessert.  The cannoli was spot on authentic, and the pistachio cheesecake was fabulous - and I mean FABULOUS!  Great place to have a great meal"}
{"text":"This place is very new, and it is really wonderful!  I love the location and the food so much!  You can make reservations, though they aren't too busy during the week, but I haven't been there on a weekend so I can't speak to that.  I've tried one of their pastas as well as their pizza and both were delicious!  I can't wait to try more on their menu in the future because their food is awesome.  The atmosphere is really great, high ceilings, a nice bar with lots of seating, free standing tables on one side and large booths on another, it is altogether laid out very well.  I also like that it is modern looking on the inside, no tacky Italian-esque decor from Target here, the design is really well done.  I've always had great service here, the servers are nice and attentive, and they can answer any questions you may have.  The location of this restaurant is also great in that it is close to Old Town Scottsdale, but far enough away so that you can find a parking spot and you don't have to deal with hoards of crowds."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there 2 nights ago. As experienced maybe even semi professional Italian food snobs, I can say we enjoyed our meal immensely. We were not very hungry so only had a plate of marinated anchovies and a pizza to share. The pie was the eggplant and other veggies with dry ricotta. Both were delish. The vino was nice and so was the beer. For some reason most restaurants in scottsdale we sampled do not have draught beer. Vivo does. Thanks!
Our waiter, Joe was a joy. While he is not Italian he is Sicilian which is almost as good. Quite the professional. 
The restaurant is new but you cannot tell they have only been open five weeks. Very well run and a pleasant ambiance. 
Do yourself a favor and eat there!"}
{"text":"My friends and I thought we would try it for lunch and were horribly disappointed.  The caprese salad had unripened tomatoes and the cheese was thick and tasteless, the fried calamari appetizer was also bland and rubbery. Bruschetta was just okay. We  ordered a pizza that came soggy, greasy and wet with mushrooms out of a can and when we asked to have the pizza remade, it came back just as soggy. We also ordered a shrimp dish which also was just okay, but it had 3 shrimp on it for $19 for the lunch portion! 
The waitress was concerned and brought over the owner and the chef to our table.  The owner asked us what was wrong and when we voiced our concerns, he got irate, defensive and walked away from the table while we were talking! 
We ended the meal with a cannoli - we couldn't eat it, the cream sticks to the top of your mouth. The bill for this mess ended up to be $150 for 3 people for lunch and they did not even take off the cannoli which was left uneaten. 
I gave this restaurant 1 star because the waitress was very nice but I would not feed my dog from this place and the owner needs a lesson in customer service skills."}
{"text":"Came with four friends this evening. Our group had several pasta dishes, pork chops, a variety of salads and shared a piece of pistachio cheesecake for dessert. All but one of us were first time diners here and we loved it! The food was exceptional and the service was professional and attentive.
Not many other diners, but we didn't arrive until 8 PM. Hope that people support this great addition to our local dining scene."}
{"text":"The mussels were super good, bread amazing and salad was very natural lemon dressing. All tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, but we were needlessly seated close to the entrance, resulting in frequent blasts of chilly air. A plea to the manager to be moved to a vacant table resulted in his bringing in a very small table and two chairs from OUTSIDE to reseat us. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with another couple, had reservations that were not necessary as place was not very busy. Had to use valet parking even for handiccap parking. Let me start by saying they do have a nice menu, reasonably priced entrees, overpriced wines but  the service was good. Started by ordering a Gibson but they don't have cocktail onions! Ordered the beet salad to start, nice size but tasted like canned beets. Had the pork osso bucco(didn't offer veal or lamb) over risotto. Nice portions but pork was on the dry side and risotto tasted more like al-dente white rice, not even close to creamy.. Others in the party said meals were okay but nothing worth coming back for. Didn't bother ordering desert as it couldn't have made up dinner. Disappointed to say the least. Manager never even came by table to check on everything as one would expect in a restaurant like this. He surely wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!   The food was fabulous,  the pasta was very light and oh so flavorful!  Our waiter was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.   My husband and I  had a wonderful experience at Vivo, we will definitely return for more delicious Italian fare!!!  This restaurant is a must!  Absolutely 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Meet a girlfriend for lunch today and we had a wonderful experience. Our service was phenomenal and as authentic as you can find, she is originally from Milan and has been here for a year! She was delightful. Both of our salads, one salmon and one chicken kale, where top notch. However, the item that topped off our afternoon was the OUTSTANDING cappuccino that was as the best, next to having them actually in Italy! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fortunate to have Vivo in our neighborhood! We're foodies, not easily impressed, and food has been superb every time. This week I had the mixed seafood dish (basically a Cioppino with fish, shellfish, and a luscious tomato sauce, but I can't remember the name of the dish). Our waiter, Evan, (delightful East Coast vibes and entertaining conversation) suggested that I have it over pappardelle pasta. Heaven! My husband had salmon, prepared to his desires (they will happily customize), and a salad. Dinner comes with lovely grilled bread with olive oil. Portions are generous, and I took the leftovers home to slurp up. Vivo is owned by Tomaso, whose restaurant Tomaso on 32nd St in Phoenix has been a perennial Phoenix old-line fav for decades -- and for good reason. I invariably order a glass of Tomaso's proprietary Sicilian wine, called Luxus, which is perfection to my taste -- a full bodied and perfectly balanced red, flavorful, complex, not sweet."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I, visiting from Chicago and staying at Camel Back Inn, had a spectacular, 5 star experience at Vivo. From the moment we entered the restaurant to the time we finished our desert, the service was friendly and attentive, the starters, freshly made pasta entrees and homemade gelato Caramelized sea salt desert was off the chart delicious.
We can't wait to tell our friends,  who visit Scottsdale regularly, that we have found the ultimate Sicilian culinary delight. 
Moreover,we can't wait to return ourselves so we can return to Vino's."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for lunch with clients.  The food was great, but the service was poor.  The place was empty and the gentlemen serving us took forever to come over and get our drink order.  We had to engage him to come over several times for refills as well ordering our meals.  Least impressed with the service but the food was good."}
{"text":"We had a dinner here for my parents 60th wedding anniversary, 16 people. They accommodated us no problem even tho the party room was already in use. All meals were hot and delicious. Not an easy task for that many dinners @ once. My compliments to the kitchen staff! Our sever did a great job also, handling all 16 of us by herself, keeping up with drink orders and refilling the bread which is delicious. My husband's  only complaint was that I wouldn't let him order the tiramisu.:-)"}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  The setting is beautiful and everything is delicious.  My parents are from Italy so I rarely go out for Italian food because I'm always disappointed. Not so at Vivo!  I love everything here from appetizerzs to desserts.  We have gone with friends and every dish we ordered was excellent...everyone was happy! I  would say my personal favorite is the butternut squash ravioli!  Our favorite waiter, Luciano always makes excellent recommdations, so pleasant and patient....and never rushes us.  Go to this restaurant-you won't be disappointed...it's that good!!"}
{"text":"3.5*** but since yelp doesn't allow 1/2*...I'm giving Vivo 4.

PROS
1. Good efficient service
2. Appetizers very good - caprese bruschetta and caesar salad
3. Homemade pasta
4. Portion size was surprisingly larger than expected

CONS
1. GARLIC, garlic and more garlic! I'm not exaggerating. I like garlic as much as the next person, but it was extremley overpowering in my entree (shrimp fra diavolo). Diavolo should be spicy...all I could taste was the garlic. If I didn't need to be somewhere after dinner, I would have sent it back for a less garlic-y redo"}
{"text":"Delicioso! Authentic Italian food, inviting atmosphere and great service. We ordered the calamari, prosciutto and fig pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever been too. Service was unbelievable and the employees all had great customer service and friendly faces. The employee I was thankful to encounter was David. He knew everything from wines to meat. Amazing experience. I recommend to all of my friends and family. 5 stars for me. 

Thank you greatly for amazing customer service. You don't get that much these days."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food. Everything was so delicious. One of our favorites was the gluten free ravioli (neither my boyfriend or I are gluten free but the mushroom sauce sounded so good we decided to give it a try). The service was spectacular as well. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Had dinner New Year's Eve. The server was attentive and friendly. Crab stuffed ravioli was great as were two specials including a salmon dish. The biggest disappointment was the lobster bisque. It was very watery, not at all what we expected from this tomaso spinoff. We might go back but I'll investigate other Italian restaurants before a return. Having lived in Europe 6 years and visited Italy dozens of times I'm still looking for that food experience here at comparable prices."}
{"text":"Got to love when one of the owners is the chef. Had a business meeting there and the room was perfect but the food was a hit. When you see physicians clean their plates you know it's good. Love their focaccia bread!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice meal at Vivo. My wife and I shared a pizza and a ravioli dish. Both were very good, made from quality ingredients, flavors right on. The only complaint was the ravioli was undercooked, not al dente like it should be. Our kids ordered pizzas and were very satisfied. The service was very good, the atmosphere was nice, mandatory free valet, but tips expected. Overall a nice dining experience that will cause us to repeat soon."}
{"text":"The food was not that great. I had high hopes as some times Tomasos food is great and others not so great. I would say this is his biggest weakness. Inconsistency. Today was not a great day. The veal was bland no seasoning and the raw onions was over powering. In addition the service was mediocre. Tomaso and 2 other persons sat at the bar while the waitress scrambled around. We won't go back and won't recommend. The pizza was ok."}
{"text":"My rigatoni bolognese was delicious, but my friend's tagliatelle (pasta made in house) was on another level. Service was excellent. Valet was complimentary. The only reason this isn't s 5-star review is that although the website says happy hour goes until 6:30, it has apparently changed to 6, and after we pointed out the advertised time and were brought the HH menu, we were nonetheless charged full price for the wine we chose and were not allowed to order food off the HH menu"}
{"text":"Bought a restaurant.com certificate for this restaurant and my husband and I had dinner there last month. The atmosphere is not the fanciest. They have weird table clothes and the flooring is industrial looking which doesn't match the rest of the decor. The food was delicious and affordable and our waitress was wonderful. I had been looking for a local italian restaurant that isn't too pricey and this is it. We will definitley be back!"}
{"text":"This was quite a disappointment. Waited almost 1 hour for entrees. \"Kitchen backed up, sorry\" was the explanation. Overall a poor experience. Veal roulade was a salty mess, sent it back."}
{"text":"Wow! How have I not been here before last night? Great food.. Seriously good. I'm not a foodie but everyone at the table lived their meal, good wine, great service.... We will go back because my husband wants to order the osco bucco our friend ordered. Great experience."}
{"text":"This is our second time here in the past few months.  After the second visit, my husband and I decided that this place was just sub par Italian food at best.  As he stated:  \"this restaurant belongs among the crappy sell out Italian places in Little Italy over in cleveland\".

The food each time we went was one of a few things:
1.  Soggy (especially the chicken Marsala)
2.  Oily (the bow tie pastas)
3.  Tough. (This last time both of our chicken dishes required way too much time to chew).

Will we be going back?  Maybe.  But only if we get a gift card."}
{"text":"Myself and two friends went to Vivo for the first time on a Friday night.  There were two large parties waiting before us (8 & 6) so we ended up waiting about 20 minutes.  It was a super cute, trendy restaurant.  It'd be more suitable in Tremont or Ohio City.  Once seated our server was pretty attentive.  One friend ordered a Blue Moon and he told us there was only one more left so he was holding it for him.  While I felt it was pathetic they didn't have more in stock given that it was 7pm on a Friday, I appreciated his honesty.  One friend had the tilapia which he enjoyed.  I had the gnocchi rossa which was very tasty.  Our other friend had the salmon salad which the menu listed as having arugula but she said it was just a spring mix but still good.  I love that the kitchen is out in the open and created a nice ambiance.  The hostess was awesome.  I run a social organization and I have already made plans to bring back a large group to the restaurant and she was great to deal with.  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"First time at Vivo. Their TV was playing Italian TV shows which was cool.   First the food was excellent, no complaints at all, actually excellent.  Bruchetta Crudo was outstanding, veal marsala was tender, and had three veges with with it were perfectly cooked.  The pasta was al dente  and the meatballs were very tender. Oh, the Pane(bread) is home made.  The original waitress was a bit shaky but when Lucuano took over things went well.  The Italian wine list was quite interesting at very fair prices.  I would call this place mid priced and I will return.  My only complaint is the wine glasses have lips on them. .  I would have bought a bottle of Tignanello but but those cheap glasses dont fit a $340 dollar bottle of wine.  Understand 90% of the wine is FAR less expensive."}
{"text":"This is some of the best, if not THE best pasta and meatballs I have ever eaten in the Cleveland, Ohio area. This place is a winner all the way around with fantastic Italian food, great service, wonderful atmosphere (they really make you feel welcomed) and prices that are really reasonable. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for some of the best Italian you'll have by a long shot."}
{"text":"Something has changed!  The place is empty when it used to be wait list only.  I think the manager that has been there is gone and obviously there was a new chef with a new menu.  Service was terribly slow.  My husband went inside to find out where our dinners were.  When they finally got there about 10 minutes later, we all started talking about things are not the same.  The Eggplant Torte has been my favorite dish, nicely plated....not tonite.  The chef just kind of put some eggplant slices on the plate and covered it with sauce.  I ordered Pasta with Clams.  Some clams were open, some were closed.  Taste was non existent.  The people who ordered the petrale sole said it was loaded with salt an inedible.  We were a group of 6.  Four of us had been there many times and all 6 agreed this was not typical of this restaurant.  Another couple at another table came over to talk to us; they said they were having the same experience.  When the manager finally came out to talk to us, we asked him where the regular manager was and he said he's been here since the opening.  NOT TRUE. When we queried him about this, he admitted that he goes from other locations and comes here also, sometimes.  So no manager, no regular chef, no business, lousy food...we no return!  What a shame."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I work nearby and had to stop in for lunch today.  The arugula, pear and pecan salad was incredibly good. We had the Pizza Bianca which was topped with truffle infused prosciutto and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  It was to die for! The pasta combination we shared was incredible too.  There is a great bar in the middle of the restaurant that is a perfect happy hour spot.  There is a really cool mozzarella bar that I can't wait to check out. The wine list at Vivo is also very impressive.  So many reasons to keep coming back - can't wait!"}
{"text":"If I focused entirely on the food, 5 stars.  Then I add atmosphere at a 2.5, curb appeal also at a 2.5, service at a 3, menu at a 4 and meeting me halfway on a bill issue, I ended up at a 3-3.5.  The servings are huge and great.  I could've easily shared one meal with my girl and I'm not exactly a light eater.  I'm picky about how things look, i found the tile floor and plain drop ceiling boring.  If they were going for a small, kinda cozy italian restaurant, they missed the mark.  The bar and kitchen (open kitchen behind the bar) area looked clean, everything else was alright.  So, the bill issue...  We both asked for alla vodka sauce and the server had told someone at the opposite side of our table that there was a small upcharge for switching from marinara to alfredo.  My girl and I didn't hear that and proceeded to switch ours from marinara to alla vodka.  She didn't tell us about the upcharge.  Normally, I'd expect 1, maybe 2 bucks (and to be told that there's an upcharge) and I'm over it.  It was $4 EACH.  This made a great meal end with annoyance.  She took one off and it ended up 2 each, it was fine at the end, but I didn't think I should've had to tell them how insane a $4 upcharge for a ladle full of sauce was.  I'll be back, but probably for takeout."}
{"text":"Second visit: came specifically for happy hour as it existed previous visit a week before. This was partly about price but mostly because there were some interesting menu items for happy hour but not on lunch menu.  Unfortunately happy hour has been rescheduled. We debated going elsewhere but ended up staying and had a good lunch. It is a little expensive with prices being in the $12 to $20 range for salads, sandwiches and entrees. There is a decent wine list with reds mostly in the $10-15 range which also seems a little overpriced. Service was friendly but when we had a problem it was difficult getting waiter's attention. At 2 p.m. there was one other table and a handful of people at the bar so it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"We live nearby and wanted to check this place out  since it was new to the neighborhood. From an ambiance perspective this place wasn't my favorite, it just felt a little stuffy and dated compared to the other new development in the area (Sumo Maya, Paul Martins, Binks, etc.. In hindsight this probably isn't surprising as they are under the same ownership group as Tomaso's which is a more old school traditional Phoenix staple).

The food wasn't bad but there are other atmospheres and dishes in the area I would prefer to spend $20 on."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner with my husband. This is my 4th time here and I have never been disappointed food wise.  I had eggplant Parmesan and my husband had sausage peppers on penne pasta. 

Portions were HUGE. Kaitlyn, our server, was very attentive. 

This place blows Antonios away!!!  Try it; you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner one night and sat on the patio with a beautiful view of the mountains.  The restaurant is bright and airy, the service is great and the food was consistently good.  We ended up sharing some bread, a salad and a pizza.  It was just the right amount of food and we really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Fraud on top of pathetic food/customer service 
******Do Read and Beware******

--------Updated Oct, 6th 2014-------
Man! This place is setting itself up for closure! 
After returning food and repeated attempts of calling for refund (which they promised), finally, today we get hold of owner Chris who says \"he doesn't care\" and will not refund and doesn't want us back. 

Oh oh, Mr. Chris what made you think we were coming back?? 

Already talked to our credit card company and filing police report per their suggestion. Watch out folks, stay away from them!! 

----------dated sept 22, 2014--------
Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic! We loved them because they are not chain, but to be honest      the food taste and quality has gone down the hill. We just ordered Marsalas from them, first time undercooked, bland, no seasoning soggy chicken. We called, lady who introduced herself as manager (perhaps owner) was arrogant and pushy to bring food back for replacement (read with attitude, like she's doing pity on us and giving free food). 

Second time, we go...instead of replacing our meal, we get handed 2 boxes (supposedly entrees)...we bring them home, pop open, oh my god! Missing beans, and sides!! Even entree is not complete!

Here goes our dinner....mood spoilt too! 

We called again and owner/manager is so rude/arrogant says come tomorrow to get beans! Whattttt? 
Oh my god, talk customer service! Sure we are not going there again, never ever!!"}
{"text":"Open restaurant and fun bar area in the middle. Osso Bucco with ribbon pasta was out of this world good!  TV at the bar for my sports fix!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, first time here.  Excellent service, did not rush us, very attentive.  Calamari was tender, not overly breaded. Fried zuchini was great, could have had more sauce.  Linguine with clams was excellent. Chicken parm was enough for two. Veal Parma was tender. Huge portions and with salad/bread, definitely had a take home box. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Originally we were planning on going to SUMO Maya. However, when we got there, it was full and basically a nightclub. We went next door and the food and service was amazing. Food and refills just melted in your mouth. The service was so good that refills appear like magic."}
{"text":"Came for a date night on a Saturday night. Did not have a reservation but they had an open bar so we sat up there. Everything was super fast and staff was great. Would recommend for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Drive by this place quite often during the week and when I saw the Grand Opening banner I knew I had to check it out.  Took my boss for lunch and I am so very happy that we decided to celebrate the day at Vivo.  We started with salads and the caprese starter.  The boss and I split a pizza which was amazing and the salads were fresh and tasty.  The wine was incredible and the tirimasu we had for desert was absolutely divine.  I can see several more work lunches happening at Vivo in the very near future.  If you are in the mood for authentic Italian pizza and friendly service I cannot recommend this place enough.  Bravo Vivo!"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. Valet parking and a waiter who was over 25 didn't distract me for a minute from the Chicken Parm that clearly had never been tenderized and had almost certainly been frozen. Rubber doesn't begin to describe the texture of this dish, you could here it fight back as I chewed. An unforgivable sin. No real Italian restaurant would serve a dish of that quality. And my wife's meal was no better. We didn't finish our meals and didn't waste our time complaining about the quality, they knew what they were serving and I wouldn't go back there if it were free."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with one of my buds.   I had the la pasta di leonardo and she had the linguine con vongole.    YUMMMM!  is the only word to describe my dish.   It had the perfect amount of seasoning and the pasta was cooked just right.   The chicken was cooked to perfection, and it had just the right blend of pine nuts and roasted bell peppers.   She loved her dish, yes, she did.   I was stuffed to the gills, but she wanted to try the desserts.   We tried the pistachio cheesecake.   That's where the rating falls.    To me it had some kind of what seemed to be a metallic taste.    I couldn't put my finger on it.   And the consistency of the cheesecake was very thick.   We were hoping it was made with ricotta cheese.    Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that the drinking water needed to be run through some sort of purification system.    It had a chemical taste.   So if I hadn't tried the cheesecake, and if the water didn't have a chemical taste, I think my meal was perfecto!"}
{"text":"Wanted to find a new Italian restaurant and a couple of friends suggested Vivo. I'm so grateful they did! We had a delicious dinner tonight and we'll definitely be back! 

I started with the Lobster Bisque and it was awesome! Definitely worth the $11 price! Enjoyed the yummy Veal Piccata,  followed by the Tiramisu. Hubby and father-in-law both had the homemade pasta with meatballs. Brother-in-law had the salmon and son had the Black Linguine with Langostino Lobster and Scallops. Amazing! 

The service was excellent - zero complaints. Thank you Vivo!"}
{"text":"A-okay. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say I probably didn't order the right dish. Service was good, but my fish and pasta were overcooked - so, combo of dry and mushy :/ As an Italian restaurant, that shouldn't happen. Portions were generous, so I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"For being a Italian restaurant in the burbs of Cleveland's place is great! I would definitely come back time and time again. The portions are monstrous! You can order 1 pasta meal and it will feed a family of 3. I ordered the Chicken Picatta and was Fantastic. I did ask for the Vodka sauce on my side of pasta which is an up charge, but worth it. Don't forget to order the Zappoli to go!"}
{"text":"Vivo has the best meatballs I've ever had! And I travel a lot. The food is quality and I like the big booths and atmosphere. I will now be a regular there for happy hour for meatballs and wine!"}
{"text":"Finally!  A cozy neighborhood Italian Restaurant offering SUPERB, friendly service and amazing food!  Add the to the top of your list next time you are dinning out!!! Can't wait to return!!
Very broad menu!  Everything from amazing, huge salads to wood fire pizza to homemade past to amazing seafood!  Save room for the cannoli!  Haven't had one this good since NY!!"}
{"text":"I was given a Vivo gift certificate for my birthday so we went. Service wasn't great. Refills scarce. The food literally made me sick!! My stomach was ill all night. That rarely happens as I am vegetarian and its normally meat that makes one ill.
We called and basically they couldn't have cared less that I got sick. There's something seriously wrong when eggplant parmesan makes u violently ill. The cheese may have been bad or the sauce idk but I'm not gonna go back too find out!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I've tried many of the menu items but I always come back to the spaghetti ala sorrentina. Even the bread they give you is so good. Service is also excellent and would highly recommend the limoncello or other cellos that the bartender makes from scratch."}
{"text":"Greeted and sat right away! Served hot sliced bread w/ olive oil heated in a panini press - good! Service good! No recommendations or anything, was offered dessert. I had the herb crusted / kale salad very good! 
I think would be a great evening place for an Italian date night!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch a week ago after seeing reviews on Yelp. Food was excellent, my wife had a salad, and I had a chicken cutlet with an arugula salad topping it. Chicken Milanese was crunchy and well prepared. Service was excellent and would recommend to all."}
{"text":"If there were 10/5 stars I would put that! Best customer service I've ever experienced and best Italian ever. 

The owner, who owns tomaso's in Phoenix, and if you're a native you'll recognize the name because it's been around for forever, c ame up and gave us personal recommendations for our pasta and customized it because we are so  picky! 

Prices are great. will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Vivo before their grand opening, and were incredibly impressed! Fantastically delicious pizzas and pastas, and refreshingly unique wine list.  Management was welcoming and warm, and service very nice albeit very slow.  Excited to go back."}
{"text":"Disappointment. Big Tomaso's fan but this places sputters. Took forever just to order a drink. Three tries to get the right cocktail. Only had one menu for the four of us, what's with that? Food just OK. I'll be going to one of his other places that I know are good."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My boyfriend saw an interview on Fox 10 for VIVO, he decided to take me here for my birthday this weekend. We were extremely impressed with the meals, service and establishment. Our server was Luciano, he was wonderful. He really made us feel very welcomed and he was very informative on the menu. We got the antipasto board and Mozzarella tasting for an appetizer. Both were simply perfect, hands down the best mozzarella, Fior De Latte just melts in your mouth. So fresh and devine!! The meats on the antipasto board were savory and very flavorful!! For an entree we shared the Best Ever Lasagna, It was the BEST! So full of flavor, not to filling and went perfectly with our red wine. I would give VIVO 100 stars if i could. We will definitely make VIVO a date night ritual. Hands down best authentic Italian food in Arizona."}
{"text":"I've never been to Italy, but this is probably the closest you'll come to eating a fine Italian meal in the valley of the sun. Freshness and quality, combined with great service make this restaurant a gem to behold in the rich culinary diversity of Scottsdale.

Right upon seating you are served some fresh toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. The bread slices were perfect, a good balance of crisp crust with soft, slightly chewy center. The olive oil was high quality and was very flavorful.

We ordered a variety of dishes, from pizza, to a remarkable seafood platter, to pasta. I ordered the black pasta. The pasta itself is hand made fresh, with the addition of squid ink to give it its signature dark color. I was excited to try this dish out since I've never had squid ink pasta before, and I was impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, with a slight salty, deep briny flavor. It went well with the sauce, langostinos, and scallops. I also tried some of the margherita pizza, which was superbly executed with a thin, crispy crust and lovely toppings. I also tried part of a meatball which was perfectly seasoned, with a delightful soft texture. My friend that had the impressive seafood platter (Lobster, clams, scallops, and possibly more!) enjoyed his meal overall, but did remark that the clams were gritty.

Service was very polite and impeccable. Drinks were refilled quite often, and we were checked on as needed.

Parking in this plaza is a bit of a pain since there are limited spots, but they do make up for it by offering free valet.

This is definitely a new favorite for Italian food for me!"}
{"text":"Second time we went there for Happy Hour. The food is SOOOO delicious!  We loved it, and the prices can't be beat. The place is beautiful and the service is terrific. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The good was good but not worth the price  overall it was a fun night . I think our server might have been new , he did not have a lot of information. Ha check it out"}
{"text":"On Staycation for the 4th of July weekend. Went here yesterday with family around 5pm. Food was awesome and quieter than SumoMaya the night before. Get the salmon flat bread and lobster bisque. Portions are just right, didn't have to bring food back to the hotel. I got the frutti mare (seafood) pasta dish  -- very good. We'll be back on our next Staycation here."}
{"text":"We thought the pizza was fabulous.  Thin crust but some chewy like it should be.  The pasta was perfect.  Even the thin  spaghetti was not overcooked.  Very nice sauce as well.  

I thought the sole was a tad bland but nicely prepared (I like spicy and will choose a pasta next time).  

Nice decor, music at the right level, not deaf inducing.  Great waiter. great service.

We were hesitant to try it as we hated the loud obnoxious next door neighbor (Sumo Maya), which for reasons unknown is always busy.  But really glad we did, and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuuum!!  Last month, I ate at Vivo twice in a two week period because it is so delicious.  I am a sucker for homemade pasta.  Both times I ordered a pasta special called the Michaelangelo.  The sauce involved short rib, truffle something or other, and, I think, magic.  It was heavenly, as were the fresh spinach noodles that it topped.  My bf ordered the ravioli, and it was the best ravioli I have ever eaten.  I never order ravioli at restaurants because I love noodles so much, but, I might have to make an exception next time I eat there.  My friend ordered the carbonara, and it was great too--not overly heavy, which is quite an accomplishment in my book.  I also had the Vivo salad, and it was very light and fresh. The pizzas looked amazing, so I'm hoping to try one before too long.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My manager has been nagging me to try this place since it opened so when I went for lunch with a girlfriend the other day, I was hungry but not sure what to expect. After the most amazing toasted bread with olive oil and melt in your mouth ravioli, I told our server \"this reminds me so much of Tomasos\" He said \"it should, it's his recipe!\" We have been staying for years that our only complaint about Tomasos is that it is such a long drive. Finding it a couple miles from work is like a dream come true!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have this restaurant in Scottsdale.   Excellent ambience, not too noisy, great service, interesting menu, good Italian food.  

Our server, Elisabetta, from Milan was very professional and made the evening a delight.  We enjoyed the booth for four of us - ask for table 53.

Our friends both ordered the halibut ($35) which was excellent.  My wife and I both ordered the recommended lasagna ($25) which was good once I had sent it back to be warmed up.  We had a nice bottle of Chianti ($45).

A nice addition to the many dining choices in Scottsdale.  Note - valet parking only in this mall."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the area.  Our dining experience was top notch...from beginning to end.  The décor is beautiful...very much like something out of New York or Chicago.  The menu is very diversified; the wine list is outstanding.  Our meal was wonderful and our server knew the menu very well.  It's as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Took my BFF to Vivo for her birthday.  I had never been there before.  We had actually made a reservation but the hostess seemed confused as to where to seat us.  She put us at a table in the front window even though we voiced that we'd rather sit somewhere else. The front window tables seem far removed from the rest of the restaurant, like you are the \"bad kids\" in the room.  The hostess seemed very flustered the whole time she was trying to give our menus and actually seemed annoyed when telling us about the drink specials of the night.  (We overheard her telling a different table about drinks that she never did mention to us...)  The waitress came and she was pleasant enough and brought our drinks reasonably quick.  I ordered the chicken parmesan and my BFF ordered tilapia.  Both came out looking very good.  Both tasted very good.  No complaints on the taste of the food but it was nothing outstanding, either.  I felt like I could have been at any Italian restaurant anywhere.  When our food arrived our waitress asked if anyone wanted fresh grated parmesan and I said yes.  Ten minutes later, she finally came back with the cheese.  While she apologized profusely for it, I was 75% done with my food by that time.  They were not that busy that we should have had that flustered of a hostess and that backed up of a waitress.  It would not be my first choice to go back there again."}
{"text":"Food was good, ordered the blue crab stuffed prawns with lobster ravioli, but out of the two ravioli's, one tasted completely different.. it was really sweet and it just didn't taste right. The waiter (reciept said Joseph) was ridiculously rude, walked right in front of our table multiple times, then when he did stop to ask \"how you doing\"-  he tapped the table quickly - and kept walking not even looking at us or waiting for our response. Even after I pushed our plates to the edge of the table, he still walked by and looked right at them and proceeded to tend all the other tables. Also, the classic rock they were playing reminded me of sitting in my dad's garage... completely didn't suit the enviroment. Then, a gnat kept landing on the ravioli that I couldnt bring myself to eat... To end the night, after he ran our card, he dropped it off and didn't say a word.... No, goodnight or thank you. The nicest person to us was by far the bus boy."}
{"text":"This place really isn't very good at all. The service was bad and the food was worse. I rely on Yelp and I hope I bring this rating down and help others from dining here."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant next door to that ridiculous sumo Maya. The atmosphere is nice and it's a very pretty restaurant. The wine list is extensive...5 pages I believe. They have a ton of specials and they all sounded very good. I would recommend the pizza, I had the Capricciosa and it was delicious. The pizza dough had a fantastic taste and all the ingredients were fresh. The rest of my party ordered entrees and although none had complaints about the taste, it was a little over priced for what you get. The happy hour menu looks great so we will be going back for that and we will be going back for pizza. I would highly recommend Vivo for the pizza."}
{"text":"Service was slow and approximate.  Some of the food was cold or lukewarm when delivered. The menu was not up to date on the mobile site. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was confusing and the menu transition from lunch to dinner was frustrating. Over all pizza was grand."}
{"text":"We were invited out to dinner with our neighbors who happened to have a couple coupons. The coupons were buy one meal get the second free. Apparently we could not use the two coupons at the same table. The coupon said \"subject to rules of use\". My question is: What are the rules? Were we suppose to sit at separate tables? So to wrap it up, Vivo you lost four customers, you were wrong about the coupon offer, and quit being Coupon Nazis."}
{"text":"Well, this is gonna be a challenge.  I only ate here once so far.  I will return.  Especially if the food is as good as we got with this visit. I chose the pistachio crusted grouper (fantastic- one of their most popular) and my wife got the hand-made gnoccis in tomato cream sauce.  YUM...we shared our dishes with each other and left vowing to return to explore more of their menu selections.  However!.....and you just knew there was gonna be an eye opener.  I recently ordered a selection of pizzas for take-away, and we were left very disappointed.  Honestly, (and I always am for you), they weren't any better than Marco's!   Trust me, we were heartbroken.  What they call a Margarita pizza isn't...the chef needs to research what a true Margarita pizza is, and why.  There is no variation on this one whatsoever.  The sauce was sour, the cheese..industrial quality, and the crust...eh...not what we were anticipating.  There pizza creations need an entire makeover. 
  But, the dining selections again, were great and we will keep returning as long as this continues.  Overall it is a really nice, clean, crisp, cozy neighborhood dining experience that anyone (from a couple to a nice group size) can enjoy and leave satisfied.  We need more of these sprinkled around.
  (Let's just get to redoing the pizzas, they really are well below what should be offered to anyone who appreciates all that they are accomplishing here)."}
{"text":"As you walked in. It was beautiful. White cloth table, wine glasses set up. I felt like I was meeting up with a hot date. Haha. great bar in the middle of the room. Open kitchen. (Love the back spash). 

My clients recommend this place for the longest time and I'm barely trying it out now. She said \"I know you love pizza but you have to try the vegetarian torte.\"

Which was an eggplant and cheese ravioli on the side. Ohhh yessssssss... Two thumbs up! Everything was tasteful. The cheese ravioli was different. As in, I never had this kind of cheese ravioli before. I think it had a hint of mushrooms inside the ravioli I'm not really sure. The eggplant was delicious!!! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I randomly stumbled upon Vivo when planning to go to Sumo Maya, but diverting last minute to try somewhere new. I started with the lobster bisque, which was good and had a lot of lobster in it.... you definitely get your money's worth. They also give you some yummy bread to start with that tasted fresh and was great for mopping up every bit of soup. The husband and I shared a margherita pizza and it was just ok. It was a little on the bland side (especially as leftovers, but the first time as well). I know, I know, it was just a margherita pizza, BUT I think it's important that the basic pizza be tasty just as much as a fancy pizza. It's possible I just didn't order the right thing. Anyway, for the price, I don't know that I'd go back, but if you are nearby, check out the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"This was a fancy little Italian place! 

I came here with my friend for dinner. I ordered the Tartufo di Norcia pizza. It comes with Mozzarella di bufala, ricotta, Italian parma ham, mushroom-truffle ragu. I think the best part was the mushroom truffle. It tasted delicious.

So I usually like sweeter red wines so I always order a Pinot noir. I wanted to see what our waiter recommended and he actually recommended one called Nero. This was actually a Cabernet. I was actually surprised of the sweeter taste to it. It tasted amazing with my pizza. 

Everything was just on point. They have a happy hour too that I'd like to try. So I'll definitely be back for dinner or happy hour. Fellas its a great place to take that special lady for a date. =)"}
{"text":"Great cozy place, we had a enjoyable dinner started with the stuff hot peppers. Main course I had the Lasagna and my wife had Chicken Parm ( big portion ) this is now are go too Italian Rest. There home made Italian dressing is awesome, there base red sauce is sweet."}
{"text":"I watched this place being built and fitted out over months. As with most neighborhood restaurants  I have stopped in occasionally for lunch or a pizza and found everything to my liking. The noise level and music are pleasant, the service friendly and the simple fare that I tasted quite good. I had not gone there for fine dining until tonight, WOW! Starting with  fresh garlic bread and a chop salad the meal was off to a delicious start. I love seafood and when I was offered Cioppino as a special I was skeptical. That is not an occasional neighborhood dish but a practiced labor love prepared by a chef who really cares. My server promised me I would not be disappointed so  ordered it. Twenty minutes later a long thin plate of aldente linguini appeared rich in a wonderful sauce that had to have been specially prepared. Folded into it was an assortment of the freshest seafood it is possible to imagine, each piece cooked separately and perfectly. Large mussels. clams, giant prawns and succulent fish were interspersed with perfectly cooked tender calamari rings. When the dish was finished the sauce could simply not be left and the remaining warm garlic bread was the perfect vehicle to finish off the treat.
Though it was a special tonight I'm told it would be made to order if asked. Now, however, I have to travel through the menu to find out what other special delights I have been missing."}
{"text":"just drove by and found this place.  we were seated at a great booth overlooking the restaurant.  the server was a bit snooty but he seemed to be like that with everyone- apparently we didn't reek of money like others there.  i would have appreciated a little better bedside manner, for instance, recommending things on the menu.  I asked what beers they had on tap and as several were foreign, he just assumed i'd know what they were.  we had  the Crudo Bruschetta and it was WONDERFUL.  I had the braised short ribs dish (I cannot remember the name) and it was incredible.  My wife had the lobster bisque and it was tasty but unsatisfying as the amount of lobster was less than what we are used to.  I highly recommend this place.  It was a reasonably priced dinner with great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during our trip to Phoenix. Read some reviews before coming to dinner and was a little worried since the reviews were all over the place. 
However, we had an exceptional experience and we left with happy tummies! 
It was pretty dead for a Saturday night, I think there was a big game on. But our service was great, every dish was delicious, and the dessert was to die for. I will definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Bow tie aglio e' olio, lasagna 
Space is nice, clean, with an open kitchen. Held our place on the waiting list while we ran an errand. That was nice of them. It was packed and service kind of slow. If they moved people in and out faster I would assume they could make more money. The waitress did apologize about the slowness and it was packed. Something that they may need to work on. The food made up for everything. My wife got the lasagna, the kids got spaghetti and meatballs, and I had the bow tie aglio. I was impressed. The lasagna could have been bigger for $14. I'll come back here to eat."}
{"text":"Location: this Italian restaurant is very well decorated with relaxing atmospher. There is a bar area in the middle of the restaurant, booths against the wall and plenty of space in between tables. The general environment is very comforting and definitely not for a partying/loud crowd. Only valet parking is available. 

Service: Hostess was extremely friendly as well as our server and managers. Speaking of authenticity, I think our waiter is actually Italian. How cool! He was polite, patience, and checked up on our table from time to time. 

Food: their food is absolutely delicious and everyone at our parties love the pizzas and specialty dishes. Their dessert is also very amazing especially the tiramisu. I've been to Italy and theirs are just as good. If you are adventurous, you should try their squid spaghetti. It tastes better than it looks. 

Rating: I'll definitely come back here for a date night again."}
