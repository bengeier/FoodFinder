{"text":"We decided to try out Grand Noodle as it replaced Fish Soup Noodles House, one of our go to places for lunch, and was very disappointed in the quality of the food that was served. We didn't try the soup noodles so this review is based on the other food that Grand Noodle serves. Overall, I'm sad to see that Fish Soup Noodles House was replaced by Grand Noodle and I personally would not be coming back.

AMBIENCE [5/5]
Nothing fancy here but it was clean and well lit. 

SERVICE [2/5]
Service was overall okay. The waitress got us whatever we needed when we asked for it. Some key points that they are missing in terms of service. First, patrons should not need to ask for refill of tea. The waitress' and/or waiters should come ever so often to check up on the tables to see if they need a refill. Second, why do we have to ask for plates when our deep fried fish skin arrived on our table? How do you expect us to eat it without any plates? Lastly, We asked our beverages in our combo to come out last but why should we again need to ask for it to be served. The service staff should have a sense or feel that the patrons are ready for their beverages when they are almost done their meal.

FOOD [1/5]

Deep Fried Fish Skin served with Soup - $3.50
This was the only decent food item of the three that we had. Fish skin was fried nicely and soup was hot. Quantity wise it seemed a bit small. When Fish Soup Noodle House was there before, there was much more fried fish skin served.

Fried House Noodle with Black Pepper Chicken - $7.95
I can't believe how horrible the quality of this dish was. It's like something you would get at Manchu Wok. Actually, it's probably even worse than Manchu Wok. The chicken in this dish was very chewy and it did not seem fresh. For $7.95, I can get something so much better at the food court at First Markham Place.

\"Submarine\" Baked Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce on Rice - $9.95
This looked quite interesting based on the pictures posted by other reviewers. It looked sort of similar to the coffin bread served in Taiwan and stuffed rice in bread toast at My Wonderful Kitchen. The presentation was nice but that was about it.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment. The sauce was on par but everything else was not. The pork cop was chewy and overcooked, the bread was just a big baguette so you can imagine that it's quite tough to eat, and the rice wasn't good either. There was another table that ordered one of these \"Submarine\" on Rice dishes and like us, they didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Fusion with HK style, Japanese Ramen restaurant. Has a few special dishes. For example, they have a Submarine (baked bread) Hong Kong style rice. At lunch time the place was packed."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday. Seeing their submarine were on every table thus gave it a trial. It's not bad.

Ordered submarine pineapple seafood fried rice. Plenty of seafood there and the fruity taste is good. But seemed the plain rice was not cooked or cooled properly.

Their rice with pork chop and eggs is also good. The pork chop is juicy. The meat portion is just half of those in other tea restaurant, but is enough for a lady.

Will come back next week to try submarine baked pork chop rice and submarine curry chicken with rice."}
{"text":"Came to this place with a friend after we did not know where to go.  As many people said, had expectations that it was going to be just another version of Deer Garden and in some respects it was, but it really was a relatively unique experience in the fact that the soup bases and some of the other ingredients are definetely really different.  My friend and I got the Soup Noodle along with their sides of the spicy beef and marinated tendons and pork cutlet.  We also shared garlic fries and it was a relatively good experience.  

There seems to be a VIP Card that you can get that would give you a percentage off the meals as well as if you are there, i highly recommend you try what they call \"Sauce\" _____ blank something along the lines with their most popular dish.  For 10 dollars, you get a meal good for two people, very similar to a baked portuguese chinese dish but a lot more epic.  Just try it you wont regret =)"}
{"text":"Decided to give Grand Noodle another try and was much happier this time. 

We ordered:
- Signature pork bone soup with house noodle, pork jowl and squid: Really enjoyed this soup base. It was very flavourful without being overly salty. 
- Tom yum soup with thick vermicelli, pork liver and quail egg: The soup was a bit too sour for my liking but delicious nonetheless. The liver was cooked perfectly and complimented the soup very well. 
- Spicy pork tenderous ribs (side): This was actually pretty spicy! For a $1.95 add-on, there was actually a lot of meat here. 

Overall, I think their soup noodles fare better than the rice dishes. Bowls are big, toppings are generous and most importantly, I don't feel thirsty after the meal."}
{"text":"We tried the custom made noodle. 
I tried their fish ball and beef with the original bone soup...
My friend had the Tom Yom soup with fish tofu .
They both were scrumptious. 
I especially liked their hand made noodle..
This place is a mix between deer garden and Sonoma ramen. 

Overall?good was good..
Service: average to decent but don't expect the sleepy servers do more ...they seem tired ?:)

Will I come back : yes, because it has very comfortable seating"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this since it is similar to Deer Garden.  We ordered their signature pork bone soup - the soup was not salty but it was tasty after being complemented by adding Beef Brisket & Matsutake mushroom as toppings.  Overall, the Deer Garden's soup base is more flavorful but Grand Noodles offers more toppings.  We also ordered Submarine Baked Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce on Rice - this thing is huge. I say this is enough to serve 2-3 people.  Eat it while its hot and I wasn't disappointed.  I also recommend ordering Deep Fried Tofu with Spiced Salt.  Its tasty or maybe I just love fried tofu."}
{"text":"Great noodles. MSG free and staff is very friendly.  their specialty fried rice is amazing. Also at a very good price! definitely will come back often. 

The owner Simon is very friendly and is always open to opinions.  This place is constantly improving.

With their set up, looks like hot pot is coming soon! can't wait!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The chicken is too salty though, but the vegetables are fresh, especially the mushrooms.

I like how they denote the vegetarian items with a vegetarian symbol, but its not consistent, for example why does the salty fried tofu not have a vegetarian symbol next to it? Although its obvious, some ppl will scan the menu and filter out this option.

The choose your own noodle soup is popular, its good value since it includes a hot drink and I like being able to choose my own ingredients.

I also like how this place has proper hot chili oil, not just the Siriachi sauce junk (although I did see it on the counter)."}
{"text":"This location is cursed.  It used to be Fish Noodle house but I think it closed down a few times before what it is now, \"Grand Noodle House\".

The name would suggest that it would be a fancy joint, with fancy prices. But, au contraire.  It's cheap HK style eats and noodle bowls you can customize to your liking. 

Some of the things I've ordered here;

crispy fried fish skin - probably acquired taste, but it was decent, and skinalicous? At least I couldn't taste the mercury ;)

garlic fries - probably my fav app here.  French fries with diced fresh garlic. What more can you ask for?  

Noodle bowls ---  house broth lacks punch.  But generous portion for the price, and toppings you can put in your bowl.  I think if they can fine tune the broth, add more salt or get that MSG going in there!! Yummy.

Drinks - HK style milk tea are decent. I've ordered the durian milk shake and it was tasty even though it came from a powder!

Overall you can't beat this place for price, service is above average, and food is average to me, but there are some dishes that make me want to come back."}
{"text":"It's 3.75.

I have been here quite a few times.  I would say skip the pick your own soup noodles(Go to deer garden) and go for their rice combos and set courses.Their \"submarine\" rice are very good value.  One \"submarine\" is probably enough for 2 people.  They also have one of the better milk teas here(hot or cold).  

Last time we had:

-Pork tenderloin ribs on rice ($8.50):  Very good tender pork tenderloin ribs.  Rice was okay.  Rating: 3.5/5

-Satay beef with rice noodle ($8.95): Good rice noodles.  Standard HK style beef.  Rating: 3.5/5

-Hot Milk tea(free with combo) and cold ice milk tea(add $1 with combo):  Very good milk teas.  One of the best HK milk teas in the GTA.  Rating: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The noodles are ok, soupbase and the other ingredients are passable but nothing outstanding or good...eating the noodles here feels like something I would/could make at home without much effort

It's ok if you're in the area and just want some food to feed your stomach... price is comparable to other noodle places...."}
{"text":"I believe this place should get more stars than its average rating! This is the second time I've been here and both times have been an amazing experience for me! 

Most of their combinations come with a free $1.99 hot drink which I think is a great deal!

The first time I came, I tried their spinach noodles in the pork bone soup with pork jowl and sliced squid ($8.75) with a side of pork tenderous ribs (+$2.25). I also tried their famous submarine baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice ($9.95). The soup was tasty but not overbearing. It is different than the really rich soup bases you would get for ramen. I think a lot of people come in here expecting it to be something that its not supposed to be and end up disliking it by comparing it to the wrong thing. It was a very clear broth and was more refreshing. The tenderous ribs were to die for. They melted in my mouth and was incredibly flavourful. The submarine dish was huge and very filling. The pork chop itself was thick and juicy and I enjoyed this dish a lot. I think the dish was a cute idea. It seemed like a lot of people thought this was gimmicky and full of carbs. I had some of the bread with the tomato sauce and I honestly didn't see the need to eat the whole thing. I appreciate that they are trying to create something new and create a signature dish for themselves. It does seem to draw people in to try it and take photos, so it seems to be doing its job! 

The second time I went I tried their new fried eggs, another noodle soup and their sake chicken on rice ($6.95). Their new fried quail eggs wrapped in pork was delectable. Note that they do prepare this fresh, so there will be a wait of 20 minutes after ordering it. It seemed that the pork used to surround the quail eggs were not of poor ground pork quality. The egg yolks also seemed to have been extracted, mixed in with a creamy sauce before placing it back into the egg white, wrapped in the pork and then fried. For $8.95, you'll be getting 6 eggs which take a lot of work to prepare. I believe it was a pretty good deal! It's great to see the restaurant improve themselves and create more and more signature dishes for themselves. This time I tried their house noodles in a tomato soup base with beef tendon and lobster balls. I had two large pieces of tendon and 4 pieces of the lobster balls. The tomato soup base was richer than the pork bone soup I had last time and the noodles were just as great! The sake chicken and the rice on the side were also incredibly marinated! 

Both times the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They had laughs with us and didn't look unhappy or give us attitude. They tried their best to help us with any accommodations that we had such as giving us a small container of sauce for the fried eggs when we needed to pack some to go. The wait time for the food wasn't long either. I definitely took advantage of their VIP card. For $20, you get a card that allows you to get 10% off every time you go there when you pay with cash as well as a $20 off coupon for the next time you go. In a way you would be becoming a VIP for free if you visited again. You also get a vicinity card which allows you to collect points for every $10 you spend there.

If I had to pick at any flaws in the restaurant, I would say that there is only one female staff member who wasn't as friendly as the rest. Also, the knife might not have been too sharp for cutting the sake chicken which caused a bit of small bone shards in my rice which annoyed me a little bit, but only a few pieces were affected. Overall, I would definitely say two thumbs up for this place! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars

After reading all the reviews & a friend's recommendation, we tried the pork chop submarine with tomato sauce & soft pork bone noodle soup. 

I didn't like the bread, I found that it was a bit cold & stale; may be toasted it a bit would be have a warm & crispy texture. It was such a great idea & came with a huge portion.  I like it when the pork chop with no bones!!! It would for sure make a hungry teen happy & full.  

The soup base was good, the soft pork bones were soft & not over cooked.  I also like the ideas to pick our own sides/veggies, type is soup base and noodle.  

I'm not sure if they are still serving hot pot because the old hot pot heat elements from last restaurant are still under the tables which make it not very comfortable sitting there, my knees hit them all the time.  

I don't think I have the craving to eat the submarine again but for sure we will have noodles there again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 4 times, and I'm impressed by their consistency, food quality, and service. I tried their submarine once, which was really big for the price, it was also delicious. They wrapped the submarine so well if you can't finish the whole thing, which is quite usual because the portion is even large for men. I also tried their fried egg pork chop rice, pork soft bone rice, beef with rice etc. They all taste pretty good. One thing that's worth mentioning is their beverages. The old school milk tea and chocolate milk tea were AMAZING. I always wanted to go back just because of their drinks."}
{"text":"For this type of restaurant (cheap, fast, large portioned) its surprisingly good. Compared to Deer Garden, which use to be my go to, this place has way better quality meat and topping selection for their noodle soups. It's become my new go to. Highly recommend trying their spinach noodle, pork jowl, and squid ball (best squid ball!) I really hope this place won't close down, since this location changes businesses so much."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very similar to Deer Garden but I feel the food are much more tasty! More options to choose from as well. I ordered the soup noodle, the soup base is a bit bland but I think its good because it's not as much MSG, you can also add some chili oil to give it a little kick which i did. My boyfriend order their black pepper chicken fried noodle, it was good, a tad salty but very flavourful. We got a cold HK milk tea and chocolate milk tea, both was very good. The chocolate one would be much better with more tea but overall it was a good drink.

I would definitely recommend anyone reading to give it a try and I would definitely go back again to try one of their rich dishes which also looked tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. The food was a little salty. It was edible but after a little bit the saltiness really takes away the taste of the food. 
With the pho. You have the option of customizing to your liking. Two free items besides noodles and each addition is 1.50$ 
I got the spicy broth with beef, beef tendons and cucumbers
The pho soup was really good . I liked the broth a lot . 
I didn't like the fresh ground pepper balls in the soup. But that's just me. Ive been to a lot of pho places and theirs was fresh tasting. You don't get the heavy feeling after."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since it seems to get good ratings, but nothing about it made me jump out from my seat.

I came here on a Sunday night and it was rammed, actually having to wait in line but not too long. The decor is very nice and very clean with windows all around, so that's always a plus! Menu is small and easy to read so it's good for people like me who can't narrow decisions down as quickly. Staff is friendly and fast as well.

Food came out pretty fast but my only regret is not coming in a little sooner since my original order were those hugeeee subs with rice in it. When I had ordered it our waitress had scurried back to our table telling us they were all sold out of the subs. So I hurriedly made a quick choice and got the chicken cutlet with curry sauce. My party both got noodle soups.

My meal was good, I mean it's nothing to complain about and I don't know what to really expect from a simple dish. No complaints but it didn't blow my mind. I do appreciate them going up and beyond though by serving pop in those fancy glass bottles, I've never actually experienced that in ANY restaurant.

My party though didn't enjoy their noodle soups too much and said the soup base was bland and they've had better. Personally I'm disappointed I didn't the noodle soup instead of the chicken cutlet because I feel my review would actually be based on what they normally serve.

I will be giving Grand Noodle another chance since I feel I didn't get the star of the show, and that's their big rice subs or noodle soups. Hopefully by then my rating will go up. I do enjoy the plaza it's in. It's a nice big lit plaza with tons of other late night food options around! So easy to find and fun to be around."}
{"text":"For those of you who have trouble locating this place as it is sort of difficult to spot at first, it's located beside iDarts edge. Seeing that this restaurant is fairly new, the atmosphere was very welcoming and the interior decor was well done and simplistic. My boyfriend got the pork chop rice with tomato sauce and I got the pineapple fried rice, which I found both highly enjoyable and filling (both these entrées are set courses which comes with a drink). The only part that had me concerned was finding a long strand of hair halfway into eating my meal, but the waitress was understanding enough to make me another one. Not to mention the owner apologized a few times for making such a mistake. Otherwise, I would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5 stars

This place is just like Deer Garden and Yo-Gi Noodles where you can choose to build your own noodle (or rice) bowl or order their set dishes. You can also make it a combo with drinks at a diacounted price. 

To start, the special dish here I'd say is their submarine rice where its rice baked in a football sized bread bowl topped with protein and a lot of sauce. For an extra $0.50 you can make it fried rice instead of white rice. Its reallly filling (that's a lot of carbs). Its worth it if you want to be stuffed for $11 or share ut with someone. Its ok and creative.

Secondly (i didnt try this but) the iceless hk style milk tea is interesting. Its a cup of milk tea sitting in a bed of shaved ice to keep it cold without watering it down.

Speaking of watering down stuff, the house special soup ... was kind of disappointing. It was ok but was not rich and full of flavour.

I got the spinach noodle it didnt taste as green as it looks so there's nothing very spinached about it.

They are thougg generous with their portions compared to the other two noodle places i mentioned. 

I ordered the tenderous meat and that was good.

The service was ok although one short haired four eyed lady was either lazy or just not too good. Twice she put our specific dish ordered by the guest on the edge of the table and didnt have the effort of putting it in front of us.

Overall, I'd come back but i wasnt crazy about it. 

They also have a Vicinity 10% vip discount program for a cost of $20.

Also, if you gave not been to Commerce Gate, parking sucks .... good luck."}
{"text":"I would give a 2.5** 

It's not a bad idea for a quick lunch. Prices are average for any chinese food (hk style) cafe. Food taste wasn't bad but not extra ordinary like \"wow\" I'll go back or have craving for. 

I just didn't like how there's quite a lot of MSG the time I had it. I was having dried mouth, thirsty and thirstyyyyy for the entire day. 

For similar noodle soup or plate of rice, I think I'd go to a better location. Lots of different restaurants around the area in Markham."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Most dishes come with a free side drink, and for $1 extra you can upgrade to a cold drink, like the \"iceless HK style tea\" which is served cold by keeping the cup in a little ice tray.

The curry dish is fantastic (about $8), and if you're feeling really really hungry (or if you're sharing with someone) you could order the curry submarine for about $9 (warning: lots of bread). The soups are great too, and you can pick your own toppings (around $6-7).

If you're on a diet, get the noodle soup with pork bone broth, no salt, the shiratake noodles (almost no carbs), bokchoy and mushrooms!

They have a membership card that costs 20$ and gets you 10% discount for life, and a $20 voucher for next time (so basically it pays for itself)."}
{"text":"Location/Environment/Service:
- Right on Highway 7 within Commerce Gate, very convenient locations with underground parking available
- Typical modern Chinese restaurant (or \"cha chan tan\" if you call it)
- Have noodle menu available where you can select your choices or you can order directly from their non-noodle meals
- Staff is very friendly and attentive 

Food:
- Baked Pork Chop Rice Submarine

This is one of the signature dishes and most interesting presentation.  Literally using a loaf of bread as base, adding on fried rice inside and fill it up with baked pork chop and juicy sauce.  This is a very big portion that can probably fit 2-3 people (so good idea to share).  The pork chop was still tender and flavorful (usually some are very hard and dry).  There was a lot sauce, so it was perfect mixing it with the rice or dipping it with the bread.

Overall the signature is worth for you to come and give it a try.  They have other options like noodle within the bread, curry flavour.  I haven't tried their noodles - so I can't comment much for that.  But this is a typical comfort Chinese food that you would enjoy during a cold or rainy or super hungry day!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with family for one purpose and one purpose only. To order their submarine pork chop on rice. Such an amazing deal. For around $10 you can easily satisfy 2 ppl. The flavour of the tomato sauce was great and they took the time to pre slice the pork chop for your convenience. I do wish that the submarine bread was less stale though because it made it very difficult to eat. I also made the mistake of ordering it for myself. Needless to say, I had to eat it for dinner too.

My mom ordered the noodle dish. It was ok, nothing exceptional, which is surprising for a restaurant with noodle in its name. I forgot what my dad ordered but I did want to note that most of their rice dishes for lunch comes with their signature fried rice which was delicious! I also recommend their traditional style milk tea which I believe is made with condensed milk. Like really, you can never go wrong with condensed milk. Never.

Overall, cheap food, large portions (someone brought their own box to take away what they couldn't finish), prompt and friendly service. Great place for lunch especially in light of their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Ordered the submarine baked pork chop because it looked so good on the pictures (baguette stuffed with rice, and topped with pork & sauce). It was massive. I couldn't even eat half. Note that it consists mainly of bread and rice... 2 things that I usually try to avoid/ minimize. The baguette was tasty though. I wasn't the biggest fan of the pork or the sauce however. I won't order this dish again, but it was cool trying once. 

I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I tried my wife's curry chicken katsu, and that was delicious. 

Prices are fairly reasonable. Parking is a little annoying though (busy plaza). Service is friendly. It gets busy"}
{"text":"I have nothing to complain about and also did not see anything extraordinary. It's like a typical asian restaurant but with a slightly better service and the interior is decently kept clean and tidy. I came here on a weekday during the afternoon so it was quiet with few people. I highly recommend coming at between 2:30-4:30 pm because they have their special menus where most of the items are about $5. The portion is generous and quite filling. Only downfall is that I wished they had their HK style milk tea in a cold option because it was quite hot outside and a cold drink would've been nice. Overall, this place is good to just sit back and enjoy a comfortable meal."}
{"text":"As a noodle bar, this is one of the locations that have caught my family's attention. In one of the corner spots inside Commerce Gate, it has a large space with tons of windows, giving it beautiful natural lighting.

The food here was quite expansive, as they offered more than just noodles. First off, their noodle bar selection was quite good, as it had different soup bases and ingredients for your noodle bowl. The best part of this was that majority of the soups and ingredients didn't have an extra charge like the other places. The only things that did have an extra charge for were the premium ingredients and a little extra for the specialty drinks.
Along with the noodles, they also have a full menu of other dishes. The most notable were the 'submarines'. It seems to be a rice dish baked in a loaf of bread and covered in sauce. Seemed very interesting and unique and probably worth a try. Just make sure that you are sharing this one as it seems to be quite large.

The service here was very quick and the staff seemed to move with purpose. Not a lot of smiling going on as they were quite busy, but got the job done.

They currently offer an option to buy a VIP card for $20, which saves you 10% on each visit. If you enjoy it and plan on going back again, this is worth the buy. One of the better noodle bars in my opinion, so worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents recently.  We all had their customizable noodle soups and we loved it!

The soups are all $8.75.  You chose a broth, type of noodle and 2 toppings.  You can add extra toppings for $1.50 each.  There is also a place for you to indicate if you don't want any of the standard things they add to the soups like corn, green onions, and seaweed.  The soups also come with a free hot drink.  The hot drinks you can choose from are any on the menu that sell for $1.99.

I got the pork bone broth with spinach noodles and sliced beef and fried fish balls.  My mom got the pork bone broth with egg noddles and beef brisket and shrimp wonton.  My dad got the mushroom broth (+ $1.50 extra) with house noodles and beef tendon and tripe.  

I enjoyed my soup very much.  The spinach noodles were soft and slightly chewy.  I saw tiny pieces of spinach in them, so they were made of real spinach and not just mainly food colouring like some \"spinach noodles\" I've had.  They also tasted like spinach.  The beef slices were very tender and not tough or chewy.  The fried fish balls were ok, but nothing to write home about.  The broth was slightly bland in my opinion (which is saying a lot since I usually complain that things are too salty), but it was still good.  It was rich and milky.  I asked for no corn, but there was rogue corn in my soup.  It wasn't a big deal for me because I just scooped them out.

My mom liked her soup too except she didn't realize that the egg noodles were so thick.  They pretty much looked like yellow udon noodles.  She thought that they would be thin noodles (the egg noodles that usually come with wonton soup).  So she didn't enjoy her noodles that much, but did like the broth, and toppings.  She said her broth wasn't bland at all (she tasted some of mine and while we ordered the same broth, she agreed that mine was bland.  I think the toppings you order also affect the broth.  My mom thinks the beef brisket she ordered made her broth saltier than mine).  She said her beef brisket was soft and tender and the shrimp wonton were full of shrimp and were delicious.

My dad loved his soup and said if we wanted to return for dinner that evening he would gladly have the same thing again (!)  His mushroom soup came with lots of mixed mushrooms (this is probably why there was an extra $1.50 charge for this broth, as it is essentially another topping as well).  He said the tendon was melt-in-your-mouth and the tripe was soft.  He really liked the house noodles (they were a little like ramen) and loved the flavours of the mixed mushrooms.

My parents had coffee as their hot drink and I had \"Old School Style Hong Kong Milk Tea.\"  I loved my HK milk tea.  It was so rich and creamy, full of tea flavour and was slightly sweet, but not overly so.  My parents' coffee came with cream already mixed in.  They were given a packet of sugar to add if they pleased.  

Service was really friendly and efficient.  The place was very busy, but the servers managed well.  My dad accidentally dropped his cutlery on the floor and one of the servers noticed and gave him new cutlery even before he had to ask.  

The restaurant is located in a strip mall so there is lots of free parking.

I will definitely be going to Grand Noodle again every time I'm back in Markham."}
{"text":"Service is very fast and friendly. Lot of options to choose for dinner. Not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Like most Chinese restaurants, they have a pretty wide variety of dishes. Here, you can get customized noodles, submarine baked dishes, and some other Chinese stuff, including snacks. 

For a place called Grand Noodle, I didn't find the noodles to be very special. They were ok. If you don't like the salt laden Japanese ramen, then you can try the much lighter noodle broth here. You can choose your noodles, toppings etc. The noodle texture is about average. IMO if you want to order Chinese noodles, the best are places that make it fresh like Magic Noodle. 

We also had fried rice in submarine, which is just a giant bread. I don't see a purpose to the bread, but then again I'm not a chef. The rice tasted like regular fried rice I can get at any random congee place. The submarine bread is edible but all the carbs in the rice, you'll probably be too full to dig into the bread anyways. 

Would I come here again? Sure. I'm not dying to come here again. The prices are very reasonable. But the food is not special. And in this area, there's stiff competition for Chinese food."}
{"text":"A lot of places turning out like Deer Garden. I'm not exactly in love with this place, but for the love of noodles I will come here. The noodles were pretty good, especially the spicy soup base. It had so much flavour to it! It wasn't just a plain hot feeling, you can feel it in the tongue and around the mouth. This type of spicy didn't hurt, just a \"cool\" feeling. Don't really know how to describe it, so try it out for yourself! There was a decent selection of noodles and soup base, but also had tons of other food as well. This wasn't just another noodle place, oh no. They have finger foods, full on rice meals, the submarine looking dish (still need to try) and a whole lot of other misc items.

The staff were hot and cold. They weren't friendly, neither were they rude. I'm indifferent about it, but wish they could be a little warmer when greeting and responding to customers. The place looks quite clean, except the fruit flies hovering around my head. 3 stars decent food and awesome soup base! I'll update this review when I order something else! :)"}
{"text":"Came with low expectations, because I was told it's similar to Deer Garden, which I'm not exactly a fan of. However, as the food came I was quite impressed. I highly recommend their Spicy Noodle (it's SPICY so make sure you can handle it). The soup was made with Szechuan Peppers, so it gave a slight mouth numbing effect. The submarine baked pork chop was delicious, but I wished it came with more sauce to dip the bread. Will come back to try other items."}
{"text":"The hubs ordered the pork rice plate which he said was ok.  However, I got the tomato noodle soup and gosh! It was horrible!! There was a distinctive can taste to the soup. Like it was poured straight out of the can and not even cooked.  I don't except their tomato soup broth to be slow cooked with real tomatoes, but the can taste and metal flavor that lingers with the soup was just gross! Will not order again!"}
{"text":"good food good service for a newly opened restaurent!
Tried the Curry Pork Cutlet tonight;
1)pork cutlet cooked perfectly, not oily and it was nice and juicy
2)pork quality was good, not too fatty and it was pretty tender
3)curry sauce was consistent, not too spicy and creamy

this is THE BEST curry pork cutlet in uptown
Grand Noodles, keep it up!!"}
{"text":"BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN DEER GARDENS ACROSS THE STREET.  Grand Noodle is a customize your own noodle soup place like Deer Gardens.  However, it's cheaper ($8.75) compared to Deer Gardens ($9.95), tastier and more plentiful.  We have been there regularly since it opened and have not bother with Deer Gardens since. 

Grand Noodle also have many other items on the menu.  Of those other items, it's a hit and miss.  The bolognese poutine is scrumptious!  The fish with fruit salad is dry and over battered.    The spinach noodle is ho hum and lacking in flavour.  All the egg rice dishes are pretty decent.  

We still haven't tried the submarines dishes where you get rice or spaghetti stuffed inside a submarine bun.  Too much carbo!  :)"}
{"text":"Consistent with other reviews, they give generous portions.

Food quality is average, but it does hit the spot if you are looking for noodle soup (which I had here).  The hk style tea is good

{"text":"A new restaurant within commerce gate, this restaurant serves up a variety of delicious rice and noodle dishes. I ordered the custom noodle soup and was impressed with the portion sizes of the toppings. I am going back to try them all out but would give high recommendations for the beef brisket. This concept reminds me of deer garden so if you've been there before, you'll know what you're getting, but better. 

Restaurant is clean, spacious and well lit. It has lots of seating so waiting shouldn't be a problem. Also if you're a big eater, order the submarine dishes."}
{"text":"Came here at 6PM on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised at the size and cleanliness of the place. Menu choices isn't too many but I like the variety of the foods they offer. You can order custom noodles with 2 toppings (comes with a drink) and also you can order rice dishes, set courses, sandwiches, and small snacks. 

My BF got the custom noodles. House specialty noodles. The base is pork bone soup. Toppings were white mushroom, sliced beef and extra side of honey red sausage. Custom noodles with 2 toppings costs $8.75 and comes with a drink as well. If you prefer cold, there is an extra $1 charge.

Soup tastes amazing. Not salty at all. It didn't make him thirsty while eating, and the soup is just really tasty. Serving size is perfect as well.

I got the Tuna sandwich (comes with a drink) for $4.50. Which i find cheap l, taking into consideration how much tuna was in the sandwich, definitely way more than the sandwich serving size of other hongkong style cafes! Tuna's tasty. Sandwich was nice and toasted. To drink I got the old school HK style milk tea, which tastes awesome as well.

So the bill came up to about $18. So definitely cheap. If you want awesome service, great serving size, good atmosphere and cleanliness, go to Grand Noodle. I highly recommend this place. Will definitely come back again.. and soon!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I love noodles, so anytime there are noodles to offer, I am down like china town.

The place is clean and spacious. Service is quick and everything arrived in a few minutes, which was impressive. There are noodles which you can customize, sort of like deer garden down the street. There are also other options for snacks, rice and noodle bowls. I chose the udon noodles with a spicy soup base (see photo).. and damn, that spice is REAL. Holy crap, it was like doing the korean fire noodle challenge.. my lips were burning and I think it gave me mini heartburn. I couldn't touch any of the broth because it was so spicy and also it was pretty oily.. the way they make it spicy is by adding chili oil so it was a bit too intense for me. I think I'll try the other bases next time. The lemongrass wings on the side were pretty good, so definitely recommend those.

What was really interesting are the submarine rice bowls.. omg it's ginormous.. so much rice and meat inside one sub. It reminds me of the panera bread bowls but on steroids.. The boyfriend knew he made a mistake ordering one for himself as soon as he saw the table behind us order one to share and they still had to pack it to go. The curry is not spicy at all but I like it. It's super creamy and it works well with the bread. 

Grand noodle is indeed grand (man, look at those submarine meals!) and definitely one of the better options to eat at in this plaza."}
{"text":"One of the best features of this restaurant is that the lunch soup specials are a \"do-it-yourself\" kind of selection process--choose your broth, your protein and your noodle.  Come to think of it, the previous restaurant in the same location also did that!

The soups are good and hearty, with lots of flavour.  Plus, the wait staff was happy to help me with my order and in general, surprisingly helpful.  I'm used to fending for myself, but they took the time to make recommendations.

I will be back to try other menu items.  Note: its especially handy to have ChaTime about 30 steps away..."}
{"text":"If you're coming for the sake of the pork chop rice...satisfy yourself by looking at the photos...as the taste will not live up to the photos and the rage...

Yes I was sold on the photos and some Yelp reviews...which full ranged disappointed me...the tomato ketchup so called sauce  was seemingly sour to the extreme...

Also ordered the special house noodles which was horrifically sour..tasted like ketchup mixed with hot water...do that at home...don't even waste your money...

I felt like it was over promised and undelivered...the prices were average...not a place I'm desperate to come back... 

#sorry #grandnoodle"}
{"text":"Had the pan fried grouper with thai style pineapple sauce. The grouper is actually pan fried and tender.  the sauce is not too sour nor too sweet. Just perfect. The fried rice is warm on the outside but hot in the inside. Probably timing was off, just my guess. I had the hk milk tea with the rice.  The tease of tea is not as strong I would like. Service is good, waitor is attentive. Place is brightly lit."}
{"text":"The never ending onslaught of fish noodle joints continue ever since the pioneers first landed in the 905; coincidentally they are located right across the street from this place. Although very similar to the others this place does offer a few twists. Firstly, their soups are of different variety; you get options for pork bone (their specialty apparently), tomato soup and some spicy one I forgot. Secondly, they also offer some kind of weird assortment of rice dishes baked in a giant football like bread bowl? Didn't look all that great so I went straight for the noodles.

For a \"signature\" pork bone soup I wouldn't hesitate that say it is mediocre at best. There is absolutely no depth, no complexity and hardly any flavour in the broth. The stock would be comparable to a salted version of par-boiling your pork bones when making soup at home -- bland.

The noodles are not worthy of mention and of course they topped it with frozen squid slices.... Although the beef brisket was tender (but again flavourless). I also had the displeasure of trying their tomato soup. I wasn't too thrilled with drinking ketchup for soup is how I would put it. On a brighter note, the side of fried chicken wings is pretty decent and the tender pork bone is quite yummy.

I don't think they place will last very long just like the fore-bearers(previously tenants of this space). This seems like yet another one of those cursed locations where nothing is able to survive. Probably cuz the parking sucks at this place during the rush hours for dinner.

Avoid and go across the street to Deer Garden, even though they are only marginally better but at least you won't get frozen squid and ketchup soup."}
{"text":"The foods are creative. Have many unique style dishes. Taste is not bad. Worth to try. Prices are not expensive. 
The portion of the submarine curry is very huge! Must try!
Haven't try the old style iced milk tea today because they sold out ( during afternoon, that's weird).
The waiter and waitress should get more training! Even u'r first time here, u seems like knowing more than them. 
The food comes out very slow, even there r only a few customer. 
Base on the poor customer service, 2 stars r good enough."}
{"text":"At first I thought grand noodles only serve noodles but they have a variety of food items.

Came here on a Friday night. Seated right away. Though parking spot was a bit difficult to find. Need to park underground.

Ordered the curry chicken in bread bowl, deep fried tofu, and Pork cutlet with rice. And both of us were stuffed. It's really cheap for the huge portion and the food actually taste good. 

Curry chicken in bread bowl:
It was massive and can feed 2-3 people. The curry sauce was thick and had right amount of spiciness. The chicken pieces had bone and the texture of the meat was good and firm. Though can use more pieces. It only had like 5-6 pieces of chicken. 
The fried rice on the other half of the bread bowl was good too; topped with cheese. 
I chose curry over other bread bowl options cuz I feel that the bread need more sauce for dipping. 

Pork cutlet with fries:
Pretty standard and I've had better pork cutlet at golden Phoenix. But it's cheap at $5.xx so no complain. Fries was hot and fresh.

Deep fried tofu:
Again big portion for $4.xx! Big cubes. Hot and fresh. Crispy on the outside and soft and \"juicy\" on the inside.

Services was quite good. Prompt response. And packed the remaining bread bowl nicely in aluminum foil. 
And they accept credit cards. Not many cheap Chinese places accept credit cards nowadays.
Will come here more often as the dishes look pretty appetizing and wanna try them all."}
{"text":"So, pretty standard HK cafe and I wanted to check on this place for one reason only: the 'submarine' baked pork chop on rice -- and yes, it's massive.  Once you get over the size and the gimmick factor -- it's just alright.

As a BPCOR connoisseur of sorts, here's my breakdown:
 - the bread bowl and rice is way too much carbs and I actually didn't finish it - I know some people say I shouldn't take every meal as a challenge, but I find it wasteful and especially lame if you can't finish a bread bowl -- like the Steinbrenner character on Seinfeld said, \"There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.\" -- I think this BPCOR would better with less rice / bread and/or had more sauce.
 - the BPCOR itself was pretty solid and the sauce and FRIED rice was solid
 - the pork cut was pretty good (not too fatty) - but seemed comically small in comparison to the rice and bread bowl
 - was not baked enough - I expect a BAKED pork chop on rice to have some some roast char, it seem like this wasn't baked at all - FAIL

So... despite how critical I am, 4/5 stars.  Maybe I've been starved for solid HK cafe or maybe I still like that stupid bread bowl gimmick -- but I won't hesitate to go around round with the submarine BPCOR."}
{"text":"We came here to try their submarine pork chop rice which literally consists of a loaf of bread, split in half filled with fried rice, topped with pork chop, tomato sauce and cheese, baked. The portion is huge and can easily feed 2 people. I was not impressed with it and found myself only having a bite or two. The tomato sauce felt like I was eating chef boyardee out of a can. My dining partner ordered a noodle soup customized with his own ingredients. The pork broth was good along with all the add ons - but it's hard to mess this up."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends after reading some reviews and recommendations. 

We tried the baked pork chop submarine in tomato sauce on rice. Presentation looks amazing but we were disappointed in the small portion of rice, and the bread was not hot enough. They should really warm the bread up or bake it longer for a crispy exterior. 

We've also ordered a soup noodle with house noodle, it was ok. Nothing special in terms of taste, soup base and other ingredients were just bland. Other places have better taste and quality. 

Their \"ice-less\" HK style milk tea were alright, as rated by my friends. 
I guess they should really change their name because noodle are not really their speciality."}
{"text":"One of many custom soup noodle restaurant in the area! We like it here because most of the broths are tasty, the milk tea is very good, and always great service. You will also be wowed with their baked bread dishes. You will definitely leave filling full!"}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the reviews here that this place is very similar to a Deer Garden across the street. However, I believe Deer Garden is still slightly better in terms of the house special -- DIY soup noodle.

Environment:
The plaza is very similar to Time Square, such that it is predominately restaurants. There are plenty of parking space. Inside the restaurant, Grand Noodle appears to be clean, fresh and model. At the table there's this electric stove top in the table, but I don't recall seeing hot pot on the menu.

Food:
We ordered a bunch of stuff. The soup noodle was exactly the same as Deer Garden in terms of the ordering process, where you select the soup base (with the option to remove unwanted toppings), noodle, 2 orders of the meat/veggie, 1 free hot drink, and option for discounted side dishes. There was the option for pork cheek and it was pretty good. But I think Deer Garden has better soup base though, and they give you more veggies, without having you to order more. 
I also got the chicken cutlet with mango sauce and fries. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the fries were the better part of the dish. They were really crispy and reminds me of those delicious fries at Costco. The chicken part was baddddddd, the meat was kinda cold and had no flavour, and the mango sauce was bland as well.
There was also the stir fried white radish cake that we ordered, which tasted like something that I could make it home with those pre-made white radish cake that you can get from Asian supermarket.

What I do love about Grand Noodle is its price point. The dishes were really cheap, and we had so much left over to pack home, while the bill came at only $23 (before tips). In comparison to Deer Garden however, Grand Noodle still comes in second, but as a casual dining restraint on its down, Grand Noodle is a pretty decent place to try out."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back of the plaza but still easy to spot. 
HK style cafe and noodles in one but done at a higher quality. Its the little things that make this place stand out above the rest. For example, a simple ice milk tea its not served the typical way. It is served with an iced base cup holder which keeps the drink cold. Never seen this before and thought it was pretty cool. 

\"Submarine\" Baked  Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce  on Rice $9.95 - a very unique dish and nice presentation. Its also a massive meal that could easily feed two people. The bowl/bread had a nice crunch and the whole dish overall tasted great. The only problem with this dish was that I had no idea how to tackle it. Do I eat all the rice and pork first and then eat the bread bowl or do I eat the bowl and rice at the same time? I went with the second option and it seemed to work okay for me.

My mom and my sister got noodles. Didn't get to try any though.

My dad got the grouper with rice. I tried some of the fish and it was soft and tasty. 

Also tried a deep fried wing but really nothing worth mentioning here.

Service was excelent. The place is newly opened so everything was much cleaner than your typical HK style cafe."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  The most disappointing meal I've ever had.  I shared a \"do it yourself\" noodle dish woth pork bone soup that didnt taste like pork bone soup.  House noodles that looked and tasted just like instant noodles.  It was literally instant noodles in luke warm water.  Also had a very watery beverage.  Service sucked as well.  Everytime we finished one thing they would immediately come and clear it.  My fiance was still in the middle of finishing his bowl and as he set his chopsticks down, they took it away.  He wasnt even finished.  Crap food and service all around.  Dont waste your time and moneu going here."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Grand Noodle replaced what was Dow's Noodles for the longest time I've remembered. They even kept the induction tables even though this place doesn't serve hot pot (at least not yet).

I had dinner here earlier today, and it was actually quite full, so the word definitely got out. The noodle menu is separate from the \"other things\" menu, so there is quite a bit of variety. This actually benefits me, because if I didn't like something here, I would probably return just to try other items (or see the reviews here before trying other items).

Since I wanted to try the noodles, I had the noodle combo with the tomato soup base, house noodles, squid balls and beef tripe, and an iced lemon tea. The price ($8.75) is comparable to Deer Garden before Deer Garden upped their prices last month, and the quantity is also quite similar.

There were a couple of organizational hiccups, as my order was initially wrong. Apparently an employee double ordered someone's meal and two orders came out, but that was rectified quickly. However I wasn't sure if they simply replaced my ingredients because the toppings looked quite clumsily put (the incorrect order had the same broth). I gave the benefit of the doubt at the end.

As for the food itself...the broth was good and the noodles were decent. The squid balls were just okay. The beef tripe, however, was not grinded thoroughly, as I ended up with a large piece of beef tripe that was quite tough to eat. Choking hazard!

Do try their traditional milk tea as it's quite unique, especially if you've never had traditional milk tea in HK.

Service was good, and the waitresses did apologize for the incorrect order made during the meal. I didn't have a completely satisfying experience, however given the diversity of the menu and other items that looked quite promising, I will likely return."}
{"text":"This place is a typical HK style noodle restaurant, they give you a sheet to choose your soup, noodle type and toppings, great for customization! Soup bases are pretty good, and there's a large variety of toppings, which are all quite decent. It's similar to Deer Garden.

They also have this \"submarine rice\" which is a huge platter of rice inside a piece of bread. It's a great deal if you want to load up on carbs. It's good, but I don't think I'd ever eat that one again.

They also have \"old school\" milk tea which is unique, but I wouldn't say it's overly special."}
{"text":"Decently sized portions for what you pay.  You are able to create your own noodle bowl and it has a lot of options. The pork cutlet is nicely fried. Broth is a bit on the light side and noodles not as al dente as I'd like, but overall a good place for a bite. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Came here again just a week after trying the noodle soup for the first time. It was still delicious!  My fiance ordered the same soup with the spinach noodle. But this time he had fish fillet slices and beef brisket as the toppings.  They were generous,  the gave a lot of fish and beef brisket in the noodle,  which made us happy about it.  For myself,  I tried the tom yum soup base with the spinach noodle and it was yummy! The tom yum soup was refreshing. It wasn't that sour and not too spicy.  I like this one much better than their spicy noodle soup.  I ordered it with pork jowl and wonton.  They gave me a lot of pork jowl as usual and the wonton was about 5 pieces and they were not that big.
We also order a side dish,  pan fried chicken steak with Maggy sauce.  It was good too!  I'm coming back again for sure because the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Very good beef and noodle dishes.
Have a new go to place near my house! Service is fast and place is very busy!!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. I always order the same thing, the soft pork bone and rice with the chocolate milk tea. The meat is very soft and 'gelatinous' which is what i like. The staff are friendly as well. Fast service, you can get in and out for a lunch break in time during the weekdays, assuming you get a seat. It used to be cheaper but now i think these rice combos start at $8.50."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because it's new and has had some good reviews on Yelp, and we're always looking for a good noodle place.  For those of you who have ever gone to Deer Garden, this place has a similar set up.  You can create your own noodle soup: choose the broth, noodles, toppings and get a drink.  They also have some larger side dishes and premium toppings.  Alternatively, they also have other items on their menu, various rice or noodle dishes and some specialties.  I decided to try the pork bone soup broth, with the thick vermicelli noodles, topped it off with tofu puffs and wonton.  The soup includes napa cabbage, greens onions and corn.  Maybe it was my pairing of broth and toppings, but I found it rather bland.  I think next time I will try a different broth and some more flavorful toppings.  After all, they do have a nice assortment of toppings and other selections.  We also ordered the fried turnip patties.  They were tasty, but could've been fried a bit longer to make them crispier.  Overall, I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Although some might argue this is a deer garden knock off, I think this place is definitely comparable if not better.
The variety is very typical for Hong Kong style select your own topping noodles, but the quality is great. Everything well seasoned and not just blandly poached in the broth. I especially like the brisket and pork jowls. The portions of toppings are also very generous.
Their soups are not as \"home made\" as Deer garden, you definitely taste that MSG. I love the tomato soup base, taste just like a HK style Russian Borscht.
Their submarine rice gratin also deserves a big thumbs up. Portions are HUGE and above par in quality."}
{"text":"Time: Saturday noon
Party of: 5
Wait time: ~30mins

Despite the long wait time.. I completely understand why Grand Noodle is so busy. After many failed attempts of fish noodle/similar restaurants in this exact spot, I think Grand Noodle is doing pretty well. Their menu does not offer a whole lot..but it's exactly what I am looking for at a HK style café.

Submarine baked porkchop rice ($10.50 + comes with a hot drink): This was amazing. There was porkchop rice in a ketchup sauce baked with cheese on top and served in a toasted bread bowl. I saw many other customers order this and not eat the bowl..what a waste! I love my carbs and this was amazing.

Honey garlic wings with salad ($5.25): This is considered a side dish; it came with 4 pieces of chicken wings (2 drums 2 wings) and a cantaloupe/honeydew salad.. the wings were really good, I could taste lemongrass in it.

Scrambled eggs on toast ($3.50 + comes with a hot drink): The eggs were very fluffy..I could tell there was tons of butter in it but that's what made it SO good.

Additionally, they also have a \"build your own\" noodles in soup where you pick everything from the soup base to noodles to toppings (~$8.75?).

PS. They mostly have smaller tables..so for parties of 5 or more..the wait time could be a bit longer as the tables are bolted to the ground."}
{"text":"This place will probably be hit or miss for most people and for me it was a 2.5 star experience. We came on a Saturday evening as a group or four.

Tried the Bolognese Poutine with Cheese and Deep Fried Tofu with salt on the snack menu. The Poutine was pretty good, the Bolognese sauce had a sweet tomato taste. Deep fried tofu had a nice texture but lacked salt. We asked for more salt on the side.

On the noodle menu, I tried the Tomato soup with Shiritake Noodles (\"Woo See\" for my Asian friends). I've never seen Shiritake as a noodle option and it was definitely interesting as a noodle choice. Tomato soup was delicious, it was light and sweet.

We also tried the Submarine Baked House Noodle in Bolognese Sauce. This thing was huge as it was served in a massive baguette. Sauce is the same as Poutine and works well with the noodle. 

Food wise, the only thing we didn't like and thought was disgusting was the Hot Horlick from the drink menu. Drinks on their menu were served in cardboard cups and the Horlick smelled like mushrooms. Three out of the four of us got Horlick and all three cups smelled and tasted like mushroom. It was very odd... Not sure how to explain this one. 

Service was OK. Food came out at decent pace but they missed one of our orders entirely as we had to follow up for the food and drink. When we paid for our food, the waitress counted the money right in front of us like we didn't pay enough. 

I'd give this place another chance as I did enjoy the tomato soup but there are a lot of other options before choosing Grand Noodle again."}
{"text":"Deer garden across the street far far superior.
The brisket I got with my soup was extremely fatty, the soup was nothing special and the hot sauce was sirracha whereas Deer Garden has their incredible homemade XO sauce"}
{"text":"It is the worse restaurant! I ordered an assorted mushroom noodle soup, it is $1.50 more than the other soups but there is no mushroom AT ALL! I asked the waitress and she took it back and come back with 2 little Chinese mushroom in the same thing and told me that it is the assorted mushroom soup! I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"Sorry, probably didn't order the right items. So this review is based on the Noodles which you can pick the soup, noodle and toppings. Similar place to Deer Garden but Deer Garden was much better. Maybe lower cost but definitely go to Deer Garden if you are looking for a quick customizable bowl of noodles.

Came with a party of 3
- One bowl of the Brisket tomato based soup was cold / luke warm
- Others were hot but quality wasn't as good.
- The milk tea wasn't too bad

Would come here again but for the other dishes, not the noodles."}
{"text":"I love the Pork tenderloin ribs here! The pork was really tender, so soft, so good. The pork was braised long enough that the tendons are really soft, tastes like jello and disolves in your mouth. If you order the side premium topping it comes with 2 pieces for ($1.95). I highly recommend trying this, they have this in one of their their rice combos for $6.95
Their other rice combos are mediocre. Other good alternative to try here are their soup noodles. Their soup base is really good! The chef here used to be the owner of an old noodle place at woodbine and 16th a few years ago called \"???\" - the food is the same style as that old restaurant."}
{"text":"Thumbs up!! I came here with a friend today and we both got the curry fried pork with rice and I had a milk tea with ice cream that added on to the meal for $2 as a speciality drink. If you get a regular hot drink it's free and a cold drink is $1 extra. 

Food was delicious and I saved half for dinner - service was quick and they were really helpful. I would love to go back and try all the options. Bolognese poutine looks amazing and so does a luncheon meat plus egg noodle bowl. 

Easy location to get to in Markham on the Viva or by car. The plaza has enough parking spots for a midday visit."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite a bit.   I go there not for the noodle as most people do as suggested by the name.  (For noodle, I go across the street for Deer Garden, and order the fish soup noodle.... the only soup base with less msg).  Their other dishes are edible... for non pre-made dishes you can ask them to use less salt and msg.  The place is clean, relatively comfortable.  Food is nicely presented.  The HK milk tea, especially the cold milk tea is nicely done.  4 Stars, for cleanliness, presentation, and cold HK milk tea."}
{"text":"Our order for the night was tomato sauce pork chop submarine, sake chicken with rice, and sweet potato noodle in fish broth.  All dishes come with a drink, hot milk tea, hot coffee etc.  Cold drinks theres an additional cost.  

The sweet potato noodle in fish broth was forgettable, as in don't order it if you're coming to eat.  If you want to eat fish broth noodle soup, go across the street to Times Square and eat at Deer Garden instead.  The broth itself was very bland.  It had the milky fish broth colour, but no sweet fish flavour, there was a bit of fishiness too.

The sake chicken had no sake taste, but other than that was done quite well.  The chicken was cooked through, and very smooth.  Smooth is a very strange word to describe a chicken, but that's a term Chinese people do use.  I guess it would be the opposite of overcooked and dry.  The dish is very similar to Hainanese Chicken Rice.

The thing I have been waiting for, the pork chop with tomato sauce submarine was MASSIVE!  The bread part was a whole Italian loaf that was hollowed out.  The bread was then filled with fried rice, topped with fried pork chop, tomato sauce, and a bit of grated cheese.  The entire thing was quickly baked/broiled.  How is this healthy?  I hope people don't eat this often......  Taste wise, was pretty good, tasted like any other tomato pork chop baked rice really.  It was just interesting that it was all in a bread bowl.  For any normal sized appetite adult, the submarine could feed probably 3 people.  I wish I had put something next to it for size reference."}
{"text":"Not the greatest place to get custom noodles. I wouldn't say this place is bad, but it's also not good.

Unless you order something really flavourful, you won't get much taste in your food, especially the drinks. At least the food isn't heavy on sodium. So if that's what you like, you can definitely give this place a try.

I ordered tom yum soup base noodle, which is ok. My wife ordered a pork bone soup base noodle, which is a little bland. We also ordered the garlic fries, but there wasn't much garlic taste.

As for drinks, she got a hot Horlick, which was almost as bland as hot water with food colouring. I got coffee+milk tea, more heavy on the tea side.

Overall, I'd probably go to a different place for custom noodles, which also has better drinks."}
{"text":"Some food was great, some are ok. not every dish is great.   but because the service I gave 4 stars.  probably because it is still new the service was amazing,  very nice and friendly to explained everything. 

I like the pork tenderloins ribs,  it is so soft and tasty.  The waitress recommend to try spicy one, she think it taste better.  
The Submarine can feed 2+, great price with this big big size of food.  Its tasted good but not enough source to finish up the dish.  unless, you don't eat the \"bread\" part."}
{"text":"Grand Noodles serves more than noodles.

Think Hong Kong Style Cafe + Noodle. 

There are selected combos available during lunch and dinner hours. Menu though small and limited.

Mustard Spicy Beef on Rice ($6.95) ??????

\"Submarine\" Baked  Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce  on Rice ($9.95) ?????? with interesting presentation as the ingredients were baked inside a baguette.

???? Old School HK Style Milk Tea
???? Ice Less HK Style HK Milk Tea

Pork Chop was amazingly tasty. The tomato sauce was well balanced. 

Overall, all the food we ordered were all above my expectations. A little twist to the classic items in most HK Cafe.

I would come back to try out their Grand Noodles! Hopefully that would be as good!"}
{"text":"I probably ordered the wrong thing.  I ordered a choose-your-combination soup noodle.  I chose tomato broth (this is marked as chef recommendation on the order sheet), house noodle, lobster balls and squids.  The overall portion was huge.  The squids were very good.  The noodle was good enough considering the meal costed only $8.75.  Tomato broth was too thick to my liking.  The lobster balls had freeze burns.  They had past their prime by a long shot.  

The services was fast and polite.

If I return, I will order a different soup noodle combination, or a rice instead."}
{"text":"Food - 3.5
Atmosphere - 3
Service - 3

Had come with a group of friends for dinner, my friend had recommended the submarine dishes because they were unique! My boyfriend got that, although a cool concept, the portions were huge and all the bread went to waste. Taste was okay, nothing that blew my mind..

 I got the \"build your own\" noodle soup. The topping selection was great but soup selection was average. I got the Thai Tom yum, wasn't crazy about it.

The service was also average. Our server seemed to be quite flustered and anxious while taking our order, perhaps because of a language barrier or maybe he was new to the job.. Not sure.

Food came out all at different times, by the time we waited for everyone's food to get to the table it was already cold. 

When we asked to split the bill it seemed to cause quite a stir, and it would have been hard for us to do it ourselves because he receipt was in Chinese.

Anyways, their menu seems to be pretty unique and perhaps will give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"NOTE: im being generous and nice giving them 3 stars.

i was excited to try this place when i first heard about it.   it looked interesting from reviews and menu items.

needless to say, \"i was not impressed by their performance\"  i got the rice in a sub with tomato sauce.  Man... unique? yes...  healthy? definately no...

if you want to have carb overload and feel like crap after... this is the item for you... its more of a novelty thing to me at least.

the noodle soup is very basic... i would prefer deer garden.    i give them 3 stars because i appreciate their effort in trying to come up with some uniqueness with their food (submarine rice, and milk tea in an ice bath)"}
{"text":"Ice-less HK Milk Tea.  A picture of it piqued my curiosity for this place that I decided I wanted to come try this place the next time I had a free dinner slot.

Located in the west side of Commerce Gate you actually have more parking than you realize because it's the furthest from the main entrance.  So location in the plaza is good.

Since the Ice-less HK Tea is the only thing I knew about this restaurant aside from being a noodle house from the name, I didn't know what else to expect.

The waiter had given us the \"noodle sheet\" which is similar to Deer Garden and Yo-Gi noodle with different selections.  Personally, I get totally confused with those because there's just too much choices and you can only select a limited choice.

After what felt like a Japanese exam I didn't study for, I ended up choosing:
* classic pork bone soup base (recommended)
* House noodle (recommended)
* Fish cubes (recommended)
* Luncheon meat and Egg (my hail Mary random 2nd-choice)

And I got the Ice-less HK Milk Tea for my drink.

Service was good, and the staff was attentive enough to listen to me and Siri fail to pick up the name of the song that he wrote it down for me instead.  English speakers are not left out and even though the noodle menu needs a bit more work on some of the words.

The tea arrived first, It looked pretty and cheap at the same time.  I was controlling myself not to drink too much of it so I have something to drink while I was eating. Anyway I'll get to the tea later.

The noodles eventually arrived.  The first thing that was going in my head was... OMG what the hell did I get myself into.

The bowl was huge and the soup was filled nearly to the brim.  I was thinking this is something I would normally share with my wife and perhaps my kid in a couple of years.  I really wasn't mentally prepared for the amount of food I was about to eat.  (Mind you I can finish much larger amounts of food, I just choose not to make myself morbidly obese anymore, diets suck)

One thing that made me happy after a few sips.  MSG NOT DETECTED and not peppered to extinction.  The soup itself was light and creamy at the same time.  On its own does not have much umami, but addition of the luncheon meat and fish cubes filled out the taste of the soup.

The noodles were okay, nothing really special but at least it's not spaghetti noodles pretending to be ramen.  However, because the soup base itself is light and does not stick to the noodles, the nooldles' flavor comes out slightly.  I may try a different noodle next time, so I can taste it better.

So overall I am very happy with the noodle soup dish I got.

Now the coup de grâce of the evening, Ice-less HK Tea.  Totally WORTH IT.  I have to say this is the BEST HK TEA I HAD EVAR!

I normally ask for syrup on the side, I just forgot to ask it today, but the mix was just the right amount of bitter and sweet for me.  Like it was just meant to be, ... forever you and me ... after all.  

The milk they used gave the drink a more the rich and creamy texture.  Combine this with the fact that the tea is chilled from the outside it means that the whole mix of bitter-sweet creaminess does not change when the ice melts over time.

The only thing that would make this better is if they put it in a glass rather than a plastic cup, but it was good they did put it in a plastic cup because I thought I thought I should let my wife try this.

Anyway, I used quite a bit of will power not to drink it all before I get home.  My friend who was driving me back was laughing because he had to remind me more than once that I was supposed to bring it back home as my hand was instinctively grabbing it from the cup holder.  I was able to successfully bring it home for my wife to try a couple of sips (as she's not a tea drinker I was able to finish up the rest).

Even if I was mildly lactose intolerant, I didn't feel anything with it, but I don't really recommend you try it outside if you are lactose intolerant.

{"text":"The service was amazing, they came to give an update that the food will take a bit longer and when it took longer they came to say a discount was put on the bill. After the food arrived they came back to check how it was. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food on the other hand was not that great.

The menu should have specified that it was a fruit salad and not a green salad. Mango sauce on top of honeydew and cantaloupe tasted more like a dessert. The chicken was bland and just tasted like mango sauce. The bread for the submarine bowl tasted good when it first arrived at the table but after it got soggy and too soft. It would have held of better if the bread was deep fried rather then toasted. Also ran out of sauce to finish the rice and the bread. Saw a couple of tables just eat all the filling and didn't touch the bread.

Overall, will go again to try the noodles since that is what the restaurant is called."}
