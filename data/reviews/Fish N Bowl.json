{"text":"I don't know what the atmosphere is like because someone picked it up but the food was outstanding. I had the Poke Salad Bowl, it was very flavorful and fresh. The prices were very fair.  I will definitely be coming back to try things."}
{"text":"After seeing great reviews on Yelp, thought I'd try it out with my daughter (who loooves sushi) and my sis. The setting was nice, clean, simple. but not too fond of bench-style seating without backs. Fish was fresh altho nothing spectacular. presentation of food... simple, service was good. Our waitress was very polite, smiley and very attentive...when it was just us in the whole place, but then after 2 couples (total 4 people) came in our she forgot about us. No sake or beer. Green tea was served lukewarm, and came with a tea bag which I found too light in taste and even coloration. Sushi chef looked unhappy and not cordial at all. Overall... an OK place if you want to eat and run. Too expensive for what was offered. It's more of an express sushi joint than a restaurant to hang out, take time to eat, sip, talk, and enjoy the place. I didn't find the value in the food, ambiance and the experience (or lack of it). I don't think we'll be back. There are other places in town that has comparable or even better sushi , livelier setting, and more to offer for less money."}
{"text":"How is this place not busy all the time? We come here a lot and have never had a bad dish or bad service. Great food and great prices. Try the \"Lollie Rice\" awesome!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. My boyfriend is always looking for new sushi places for us to try. This is a tiny hole in the wall but man is it a gem! The ahi poke is the best I've had yet! Sushi rolls were loaded and just delicious! We will be back for sure! The young lady who waited the tables always made sure your drink was full and that your food was good and timely. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with a large menu. Standard pricing on sushi rolls, lots of different premium rolls as well. Being only myself I had one roll (fried spicy tuna) and it tasted good and was larger than expected, which was great for me. Their Udon was good as well. I tried their deep fried bacon (spicy bacon tempura) because of all the Yelp hype and I didn't like it. I'm more of a crispy bacon instead of chewy bacon surrounded by crispy. The maple soy reduction was definitely an unique touch though. It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of its Yelp reviews, and it certainly did not disappoint.  The waiter and sushi chef were super friendly, and the waiter was attentive.  We caught the tail end (no pun intended) of happy hour and got some great food at good prices.  Both the waiter and sushi chef gave recommendations based on what we like.  Food came out quickly and we enjoyed everything!  Highly recommend the Gooie Wooie."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Freshest of product and both traditional and modern takes on Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Tried the Area 51 roll and the baked salmon roll & they are sooooo good!! Strongly recommend this place, very clean and the staff is friendly!! I added cream cheese to my a51 roll tho I think that's what made it bc I just love cream cheese in my rolls lol"}
{"text":"I love going to this family ran business. The sushi is always on point super fresh fish and great tasting rolls. The staff is super friendly. My new go to sushi place! The tuna was some of the freshest I've tasted in vegas. Their menu had a large variety of rolls yet tons of other options for people who don't like sushi. My family was all pleased tonight:)"}
{"text":"They have the best rice free rolls. Try the tuna flower. Amazingly fresh!! Wow..see the pic."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place with friendly service. Crispy spicy bacon tempura was very tasty. I loved the tuna salad on a tomato. Rainbow roll was eye pleasing and delicious. Everything was fresh and well prepared. Love this place."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the prices are great! Surprised this place doesn't have a line out the door for the food.. Sushi was on point and the fish was super fresh.. The Uni was really good!  I usually am very picky about where I eat uni and this was just as good as sen or those places.. Best salmon skin hand roll I've ever had as well.."}
{"text":"My favorite place around home by far. Tasty Japanese cuisine and sushi. Service in general is so sweet and thoughtful. I hope this place stays around for a long time, they deserve to."}
{"text":"Fish are fresh, presentation is excellent, the cuts are perfectly done. A difinite diamond among sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"my husband and I had lunch here.
cute place, like cafe.
sushi was fine. tonkatsu was different from Japanese one but still good."}
{"text":"Been looking for a garlic tuna that was comparable to how the old sushibay used to have it, and here it is. Amazing! The only difference is a fried garlic slice as a garnish (not bad, but I prefer just the sauce). Chirashi bowl is a good rec and so are the poki tacos and pork belly appetizer (order rice with pork belly bc is has a rich flavor). Service was great, nice, quick, and friendly. Going to be a regular for sure"}
{"text":"Excellent menu choices. Happy Hour had large variety. Kids loved it. Philly roll was delish, popcorn chicken salad was yummy. Highly recommend Paradise roll. I will be back."}
{"text":"The sushi chief is extremely unprofessional. I brought my son here a week ago and the sushi  chief gave my 14 yr old son a dirty look. I was not aware of it at the time because my son didn't tell me till layer that day. In the past I came here by self and experienced the same problem but I thought maybe he was just having a bad day. I was wrong! The lunch special is a complete rip off. I highly don't recommend this place. Skinnyfat is next door and there customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood restaurant. Super tiny but the workers are super nice. It's super clean and the dishes are awesome. I love the uni or oyster In the spoon!"}
{"text":"It's a small place but it's never too busy, service is quick, and it's close to home. Food is good and prices are cheap! I don't always eat enough to utilize ayce so I like how I can get a combo here for less than $10. Really like their tacos too. Chef checked in with us and asked if everything was ok which was nice."}
{"text":"I have seen this restaurant for the last year driving by it daily. Wasn't really sure what it was so I decided to yelp it a couple days ago. With all of the great reviews and average of 4 1/2 stars I had to try it. 
My wife and I went last night and loved it!! No disappointment here. Some of the freshest fish we've had. All of our rolls were delicious and the poke tacos were to die for. They have a lot of different rolls with tuna and poke which we loved. We will definitely be going here weekly from here on out and possibly a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Nothing really to rave about. I had the Lollie rice Bowl, which was pretty good.  Poke tacos are way over rated.. too sweet.  I doubt we'll be back knowing that for what we paid, could easily go to an ayce sushi place.  But I had to try this place out."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this place. This place looks very clean with friendly owners. Bacon tempura was delicious. I had the salmon poke bowl and I loved it. The fish and green veggies seemed fresh and had just a good amount of spice in it. I would definitely come back to this place to explore more food in the menu."}
{"text":"Great little gem.  Husband and wife owned sushi spot.  Prices are so reasonable, excellent place for lunch.  Sometimes I have been here and was the only person in the restaurant, but don't let that fool you, the fish is fresh.  My favorite is the jalapeño tuna sashimi.  Only downside is they don't serve alcohol, but that doesn't bother me.  Check out the Japanese bakery just a few doors down if you want to continue the feast."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Tasted very cheap and skimpy portions. I'm spoiled by other places by me that taste better and offer more."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after some work on a Tuesday afternoon. Was MY first time but friend has been here before. The chef/owner recognized her and remembered her style of drink (water with no ice) AND name ! She was surprised XD 

I had ordered their F&B Chirashi Bowl while my friend had ordered a Salmon Poke Salad and a spicy yellowtail roll. 

F&B Chirashi Bowl - $10.50 - My friend had said another friend had liked the chirashi here. In terms of raw fish eating experience, it was someone I had trusted on their judgement in this area. Fish n Bowl offers two different bowls. This F&B Chirashi Bowl and the traditional chirashi bowl. The F&B sounded more interesting (had sweet egg) so decided to try their \"special\" take on the traditional chirashi bowl. This comes with a bowl of miso soup, as well as a side of pickled daikon. When the bowl came, the bowl was big ! The amount of food was, a little uh disappointing. Lol. Reminded me like one of those high end restaurants that uses a big bowl/plate, and put a little food. Was a little saddening. XD Japanese sushi rice on the bottom, fish on top, with finely sliced sweet egg around the edges (refer to picture). The fishes iirc was tuna, salmon, and maybe red snapper? The fish was dressed in a spicy sweet sauce with diced pickled veggies (added crunchy/crispy texture). Not what i expected the variation of Chirashi to be. Thought it would be something along the lines of maybe different fish, toppings, or what not. It was still delicious and surprisingly spicy. 

Salmon Poke Salad - This is what my friend got ... in a general sense, its similar to the chirashi bowl, but instead of rice, the fish is on a bed of fresh spring salad, and topped with slices of avocado. This is, in terms for poke/chirashi, its pretty spicy as well. Flavor very similar if not the same as the F&B chirashi bowl. 

Spicy Yellowtail Roll - Came in 8 pieces. Spicy as well. I feel like the chef is using a general spicy sauce for all his recipes. 

It was kind of hard for my to tell the difference on the spicy flavor between the 3 items. Normally i wouldn't mind spicy (actually prefer spicy) but it seemed to have covered a lot of the natural flavor of various items, esp the fish. 

Overall, decent place. Service was great. Very attentive. Would like to try other things next time !"}
{"text":"I just made my initial trip here, and it won't be my last.  The décor is a bit bland, but everything else is to notch.  The chef and the waitress were both very friendly and helpful.  Our food consisted of Japanese Curry Edamame and hamachi rice cakes for appetizers.  We had the fnb mixed fish rice bowl entree, and the short rib rice bowl. Everything had great texture and flavor.  I wanted to try more and would have if I wasn't already full...Bacon tempura and fish tacos are on my list for next time."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would -- Yes, it's THAT good!! It's no exaggeration when I say EVERYTHING on their menu is a winner! My husband and I come here a lot, and that's because we know we can rely on chef to create a delicious meal from start to finish. Their fish is always fresh and their menu is extensively creative! 

Getting There - Fish N Bowl is tucked in the left- side corner of a small strip mall behind Jiffy Lube and next to Sonic on Durango. 

What To Order - This is really tricky for me because as I mentioned before everything is delicious, but here are a few of our favorites...

- Seaweed Salad
- Curry Edamame
- Chirashi Bowl
- Tempura Soba
- Spicy Sashimi Bowl
- Any of the Tacos or Tostadas
- Screaming O
- Red on Red
- Mr. Monkey
- etc., etc., etc. (I could go on forever!) 

If you haven't tried this place, GO NOW!... unless it's Tuesday (they're closed on Tuesdays.)"}
{"text":"Meh.Crab stick in most of sushi says it all. Hamachi Kama was horrible. The market next door is very good"}
{"text":"Nice orange yellow decor with friendly owners.  Stopped by for pick up because I have a little two year old i cannot eat out anywhere with so to go orders it is. 
I ordered the shrimp tempura and it was unique that they served it with rock salt and lemon.  It accentuated the flavors and the shrimp tasted fresh!
I also wanted to try their tuna poke salad and everything was fresh and delicious.  Fresh avocados, power greens and yummy tuna. 
Lastly I ordered the xxx roll with soft shell crab and spicy crab. It was surprisingly good that I did not have to dip in wasabi or soy. Which by the way the wasabi was freshly grated and not powdered wasabi.  Anyway, i plan on coming back to get my grub on with out my monster of a two year old.  Everything was fresh and perfectly made and I am excited to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I would have to say that the food is good, except I think the portions were slightly small for me, considering the price. 

I had the sashimi bowl, which was on point, except I had it to go and the rice was sticking to the side of the container. It reminded me of the sashimi bowl I always used to have in LA. It's good to know that I have a place to go to here as well. 

I also had the Ahi Avocado Salad. I don't know what the taste was supposed to be like - it was slightly bland. I thought it would be either more shoyu-based or more spicy, but regardless, it still was good with the little wonton chips. 

I have yet to eat at the restaurant but as for the to-go, it takes some time, so order ahead before going to pick up your food."}
{"text":"Decent takeout sushi place- was originally planning to dine in, but there weren't any other customers at 3PM and I was there solo, which seemed a little awkward. The lady on register and gentleman chef were very polite and friendly, I believe they are the husband and wife owners, though we didn't talk shop.

Opted for two of the specialty rolls: the Red Rock (spicy yellowtail and cucumber topped with avocado, spicy garlic ponzu, and green onion) and the Mexican (spicy crab, shrimp, cucumber, topped with avocado, sriracha, and green onion)- can you tell I like green onion? Oddly though, the Mexican roll did not have onion topping. 
Red Rock roll is spicy- I asked to sub regular yellowtail instead of the spicy and could not tell if this had been done, it was still quite hot to me and I'm not particularly sensitive to spice. Rolls themselves were slightly smaller than expected, but fish and other ingredients were fresh and the creamy taste of the avocado topping the Mexican roll balanced out the heat of the Red Rock.

Will have to return to try the chirashi or the poke salad bowls- green monster roll also caught my eye!"}
{"text":"The taste is very interesting.. I am not sure if I like the garlic white fish with mango salsa at all.. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing Julie L.'s check in. I saw her pic of the salmon tacos and it definitely peaked my interest. I assumed this place was more like a Japanese tapas place but I think it centers more on the sushi side. I came around noon on Saturday for lunch and the place was empty. Service was delightful. The lady always made sure our water cups were full and the sushi chef made sure we liked our food. 

Anyways, on to the stuff we ordered

-salmon poke tacos: Price was $9.50 for 3 tacos. The shells were actually fried won ton skins which I thought was a very neat idea and also gave it a nice crunch. They were filled to the brim with sliced pieces of salmon and covered in a yummy sauce. I could've ate these all day.

-Tonkatsu bowl: Price was $9.50. Came with a large slice of tonkatsu, rice, pickled veggies, sauce, and a bowl of miso soup. Nothing too spectacular about this. Probably wouldn't get this again

-Pork belly appetizer: This was very tasty. Grilled pork belly covered in a ginger/sesame/honey sauce. Can't go wrong with this!

Overall, this place is a little pricey but you just have to order the right stuff (ahem tacos). Fish is fresh so maybe go towards the fish items."}
{"text":"Nice and simple. Cant complain. Not everything is great here. But what do you expect for the prices. But if you lookin for a quick lunch. Come here."}
{"text":"Their poke bowls here are really good and my favorite dish to order (it's pretty much what I come back for) Service is always great as well. It's a small place but the food has been consistent every time we come here. The lunch specials are worth coming here for. It's a great place if you have a mini sushi craving. I wish there was more variety in the menu and the rolls are simple hence the 4 stars but they're good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I really like what they have on their menu. It took me a while to decide what to order because everything looked good. I will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews & tried this place. Expensive for the small portions received. Pork cutlet was dry and had a strange taste. Tasted like it was pre cooked & then heated. Shrimp tempura was the same. Blah! Sushi was just ok."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Always friendly quick service. Price can't be beat. I go there almost every week."}
{"text":"Service service service!!! This place did nothing short of amaze me on my first visit, that I had to go back again a week later just to see if it was a fluke. And no sir it wasn't!! 

So my younger sister and I were driving in this area wanting to grab lunch before errands. I've seen this establishment many times as we live in the area but not until now finally made it into Fish N Bowl. We were immediately greeted and felt warmly welcomed... Like someone welcoming you into their home. It was genuine and pleasant. 

The first thing I noticed while browsing the menu was that the other customers that seemed to be regulars at this place had a great personal relationship with the servers and sushi chef. The sushi chef was very personable and was sincere when talking to these guest about their conversation was. I remember thinking seems like a place where everybody knows your name type spot lol ... Okay so I mention that because on my second return a week later, that same sushi chef was the one to greet us at the door and he asked if we would like to sit in the same place we did last time... Woah! Either they get no business/few customers or he really has a awesome memory. I'd like to think he cares about his work and their customers that he just remembered lol okay anyway

So another plus about this place is they have lunch specials 7days/week!! And they have a great variety lunch special offers to pick from! I was pleasantly surprised that for small homey type sushi establishment had a good variety options for their lunch specials. I'm all about deals and specials. Their menus are cute, and all their packaging for their chopsticks have their Fish N Bowl logo, which shows to me, they care about their brand and spend the money to market it. oh, and they have On The Wall Menu Items!! I highly recommend trying something off the wall! 

The Salmon Kama is one of the main reasons this place is getting 5stars from me! For $7.99 you get not one salmon collar bone (kama) but TWO - along with two fillets of the Kama!! Season and cooked to perfection, provably one of the if not the best Kama I've had in Vegas! Very juicy and had this beautiful delicious light sauce to accompany the dish. Definitely didn't need it but it was a nice addition for more flavor. For it, that's what sold it for me on the 5stars!! It's a must try! 

I also have to say what also solidified the 5stars was their Yellowtail Poke Tacos!! Stuffed with poke to the brim as it's spilling out with perfect wasabi aioli sauce, it was absolutely delicious and a must try. It was recommended by our server so I s/o to her for the awesome recommendation. I have to say the tacos were better than the poke tacos at District One which are spoken highly of

So I also ordered the bento box the first time and had spicy salmon roll and assorted tempura in my box (comes with rice and cucumber salad) and the tempura dipping sauce was so good!! Definitely not your standard tempura sauce. They added some nice flavor and spice to give it a bit of a kick but was soooo good!! 

On our second time around I ordered garlic butter super white grilled fish that lays on a bed of brown rice (plus they have brown rice!!) and mango salsa!! What I loved about this dish besides the amazing combination of flavor between the garlic butter and mango salsa was the two cuts of fish to rice ratio was perfect... 

And both times for dessert, the macha affagato is such a fun little dessert experience. It's like a green tea float but the green tea is hot! Very good dessert option, along with their other options like tempura fried ice cream and mochi. 

The establish is super cute!! It's located in a small plaza that lines a sonic and jiffy lube so parking tends to get limited. But otherwise they have cute sushi displays and a large Yoda Lego figurine along with sushi socks and other cute stuff. 

The staff was super attentive and personable and they were super cute and happy when we said we were enjoying our meal. Chef Howard even jokes around and thanked me for posting video of the macha affagoto on yelp. I thought that was nice of him to even thank me. He didn't have to. The music also set a nice sorta ambience totally not expected for a small sushi joint. They were playing soft soothing jazzy swing music like Billy Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin etc. it was a pleasant sound in an unexpected way. 

My sister and I felt not only feeling full, but happy! And not happy coz I'm full but happy coz we just had an overall awesome experience. To me, that's what really creates a five star experience!! I am a believer and I am a fan!! 

So if you're craving good quality sushi but not wanting AYCE, this is a great pick and my new spot for such cravings!  yum yum yum"}
{"text":"I was turned off at first when I realized there was no \"all you can eat,\" but I decided to stay and order just to try a new place.  The server and the sushi chef were both very friendly but not overbearing. As I  was flipping through the menu I was pleased to see low prices on every dish and some really good deals. The sushi chef saw me looking at the menu for a while and asked if he could make me something not on the menu based on what I liked to eat. I was surprised to have such personal service for such a small place on my first visit. I told him I  wanted something with shrimp tempura and eel and he whipped up this awesome roll that was exactly what I wanted. I haf ni idea fresh water eel could taste that good! 

I'm definitely going back! Big thank you to the employees and owners for a perfect first experience!"}
{"text":"Smaller bowl lunch specials that came with miso soup . Had their FNB bowl, would have liked a little more fish in the rice bowl as the cubes were cut small and a little spicy, but overall a nice meal. Will be back to try other bowls"}
{"text":"They have very fresh fish. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They don't have AYCE and they are closed on Tuesday. 

My favorite item was the uni on a spoon. The yellow tail taco was amazing as well. 

They offer takeout too."}
{"text":"ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW: NOM.COM -- at great prices!! If you're looking for somewhere to eat that's delicious and affordable, this is your place! If ya need some convincing, read on.

First thing I noticed about this place was the unassuming location. It's overshadowed in a little corner by a car-filled Sonic, so aside from the cute sign, it could easily be overlooked. 

We went in and were seated at a table in front of the chef, which was awesome because he was able to help us out with the menu and he was really friendly and easy to talk to.

We started off with some seafood salad and yellowtail nigiri. For me, yellowtail is a deal breaker--but this yellowtail was SO delicious, I could have ordered a plate full! Then we ordered the oysters in a spoon, never had raw oysters in ponzu with wasabi and the flavors went so well together. We also order the Lollie bowl that had shrimp, crab, masago over some shredded lettuce. AMAHHZING! We also had the eel roll, which was so worth the $4.50!

We ordered another order of yellowtail nigiri before getting dessert. We ordered the monaka, green tea ice cream with a little bit of red bean enclosed in a nice flaky wafer. So good we had to order 2!

I love this place! The prices are amazing, quality was great, and service was tops! We'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times and for the longest time I thought it was an aquarium store....it's not lol. First off, this is a family owned and operated joint, my kind of place. Nothing fancy or a chain restaurant, just a very cozy hole in the wall place. Like all sushi places, they have their own speciality rolls, but this place has other options besides just sushi. Me and my friend decided to order a bunch of different things and just eat off each other's plate. I highly reccommend the tacos. We had four different options of fish to choose from, so we went with the ahi and yellowtail. The ahi has a pomegranate sauce that isn't that sweet and doesn't over power the fish. The yellowtail has a wasabi aioli that definitely makes the dish. For the sushi rolls you gotta try the Cinco de Mayo. A bit of warning though, it is pretty spicy. It's an ahi roll with a fresh jalepeno and lime sauce. There are so many levels of flavor in this roll that it completely caught me off gaurd, but in a good way, and then you have the jalepeno to finish it off with some heat. My friend and I ordered so much that by the end of the meal I felt like a gullutonous piece of dung lol. I couldn't stop eating, IT WAS SO GOOD, and fresh too! We didn't realize that they closed at 9pm and we were still eating at 9:30, but never once did they try to hurry us up and kept a smile on their faces the whole time. The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and over all the experience was nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try! We ordered that, the yellowtail poke tacos, grilled salmon ochazuke, short rib bowl, and Mexican sushi roll. Everything was good, but the bacon tempura and salmon ochazuke were definitely my faves!

The service was great and the restaurant was modern, clean and they played awesome late 80's/early 90's music, which we loved!

I wish I could give them 4 1/2 stars. I just rarely give 5 stars. But I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time and I loved it.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the more interesting items on the menu."}
{"text":"Their sushi is great, very tender fish cuts and great rice. Owners are making your sushi and serving you. Everything is neat, clean and fresh. We are fortunate to have such a good sushi place in our neighborhood. They are slow most of the time,  it is totally undersold. I'd vote them best sushi place on town."}
{"text":"Really cute place, superb service and amazing poke bowl! 

Ordered poke bowl and salad, one of the freshest we've had! Drive worth it and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect. From their simple and fresh atmosphere to their sweet and friendly staff to their delicious fresh and unique food. This place rocks! This is my second time here in 2 weeks and I am sure there will be many many more visits from me. I love their display case with all the cute trinkets, and their avocado seed sprouts up front! Upon entering it is obvious that the entire Fish N Bowl staff and owners really have passion and care for this place. You will find the sushi essentials here as well as new and intriguing menu items. You have to try it! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Too soon to give this place a 5/5? Nope

Having majority of my friends living on the lower half of the 215 is really a pain in meeting up with them. But the drive was worth this time. 

The following items are ordered between 2 visits. NOT A ONE TIME VISIT. I'm not THAT fat. Lawlz.

Pork Belly - Yum! Meat - fat ratio: 1:1

Chicken Kaarage - Not too much breading and still could taste the chicken not the breading.

Tuna Roll - Fresh fish

Porkcutlet Rice Bowl - It's like any katsu but the breading is good, not too much.

Salmon Rice Bowl - Grilled salmon on rice, with furikake and hot tea. It looked like a soup or taste like one. But the idea is cool. 

Sashimi Rice Bowl - an orgy of dead raw fish....that's fresh to the taste!

Service is great. They remembered me because of my tattoo on my arm. Kinda awkward but that's okay. If you check in you can get a free drink. Sodas, tea or lemonade. Big plus for their English Bulldog stuff animal by the door. I would come back here if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying this place was a PLEASANT SURPRISE. The restaurant isn't in a fancy spot, but more of a corner of a hidden strip plaza. Not a place you would expect to find a hidden gem. 

The menu at first glance is quite astonishing, the variety of food is all mouth watering. Appetizers I haven't ever seen in any other restaurant, so we ended up ordering  a few. 

*Soft shell crab tempura - great sauce and generous size
*Shrimp tempura- different BC it doesn't come with tempura sauce but rather lemons and salt, new!
*Hamachi Kama - so much meat wow! So good!
*Oyster spoons - like oysters? this is a must try!
*BBQ Pork Belly - delicious
*Yellowtail poke tacos - definitely a new one for me but so glad I tried it, it has a kick of wasabi! Yes!!
*yellowtail with Serrano peppers - my favorite!!!!
*Uni Trio - not a fan of the dumpling, the spoon was a little salty , hand roll was yum!!
*Mochi- mango & strawberry
*Tempura ice cream - vanilla

Topping it off was the great service, she was super friendly and always paid attention to our table. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A cute spot in a little plaza, you'll notice a auto shop in the front and Sonic next to the plaza. Inside its a cute Japanese spot, I'd say 8 tables, a bar, and some specials written on the wall ( which is nice ). The time we came yesterday, they had lunch specials - bento box ( rice, hot item, cold item, cucumber salad ) or rice bowl. I chose to do the box so I can share the chicken with my son and I got the Philly roll. I also ordered uni spoons. Everything came fast, it was nice this place offers a high chair. The service was great, they were so kind to my son. They even offered my son a plastic plate and utensils for him as well. The food was great, loved the lemon taste on the uni spoons. I will have to come back again to try more, and the matcha dessert ( looks like a green tea float )."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Good menu but super slow service. I ordered 2 rolls and it took 35min. I had to ask for napkins and a soy sauce bowl. maybe because it was dinner time but there is only 6 tables. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Update - Had a business lunch here recently, and I have to admit I was a little worried. Fish N Bowl impressed me this time! Everything was perfect, I will return."}
{"text":"Very good quality for the price, my place of choice for a quick lunch or dinner when I don't want all you can eat.  Good $8-12 meal specials with ability to order as takeout.  Super nice staff, always happy and friendly.  I have been there multiple times with a friend and the chef remembers us and what we've ordered and is helpful and willing to adapt specialty rolls to our liking."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Fish N Bowl for a light lunch with my girlfriend.  Ordered the Crazy Jalapeños, Bento box with bulgogi and nigiri and the FNB tacos.  Jalapeños were good... nothing special though.  Bento box was very good, bulgogi was good, but doesn't compare to most korean places... Komex comes to mind.  Nigiri was very good, not too much with the right amount of sashimi.  The star of lunch were the FNB tacos... Fried wanton skins were perfect as a shell, and the depth of flavors was great.  A must order again next time.

Also tried an interesting Japanese Creamy Mango soda which was very good.  Light refreshing and good but not overpowering mango taste."}
{"text":"Happy hour is daily from 3p-5pm. The karaage rice bowl was delicious as was the FNB poke tacos"}
{"text":"Our second time here.  We enjoyed our lunch a few weeks ago, and decided to try them for dinner since we were in the area. I'm always surprised that it's not more crowded, given the quality of the food and attentive service from the small restaurant. We enjoyed the Mello roll (with a side of garlic ponzu) and a sushi dinner. Everything was delicious, and it's such a nice change of pace to be at a non-ayce sushi spot."}
{"text":"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: If you are in the area, give it a go.  

THE MEAT: It's a tiny, bright and clean space with matching genuinely warm stellar service.  We had the Kalbi bowl and Pork Tonkatsu (ok but not very memorable), the Pork Belly appetizer (this had definitely more of fusion than Japanese flavors, it was tasty), the Cherry Blossom which has tons of crab inside and on top salmon sashimi wedges and is a no rice roll (sashimi and crab are some of my fave things but this roll lacks texture, it was mush inside mush), the Cinco de Mayo Roll which has shrimp, avocado, tuna with a sweet wasabi drizzle and microgreen cilantro (if you like shrimp rolls and cilantro, you'll like this and it has lots of great texture... but it's supposed to be spicy and there was hardly any heat, so if you like things fiery, ask them to crank up the heat.)

Since it's in my area, the fish is fresh and the service is da bomb, I'll go back to try out the nigiri, the bacon tempura that everyone is raving about and a few more menu items.  There is room for streamlining their extensive menu but there is promise in the creativity and good vibes in this place.

P.S. No uni that day coz of bad storms in CA, call ahead to find out what's fresh/available.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Another solid hole in the wall sushi place I like to call \"On the other side of town\". Since I live in North Las Vegas, not sure about driving all the way across town to eat here. Surely though it will be noted any time im in the area because there are lots of other great options around here too!

Odd story of how got here. My oldest son was feenin for Poke but a couple of places we checked out were closed already. Not to say that this place was an after thought but I wanted some poke too.

So what we got was a Tuna Poke Salad ($9.50), Barbequed Pork Belly ($5.50), Spicy Bacon Tempura ($4.50), and a Cut Roll Combo ($8.50).

The Tuna Poke Salad was as advertised. Niblets of Ahi, Spring Mix, Avocado, and Spicy Yum Sauce. The yum sauce was actually pretty spicy. Had to wipe the sweat off my forehead a couple times.

The Barbequed Pork Belly is grilled with a tangy sweet soy sauce and topped off with green onion. A little bit chewy but at the same time it pretty tender if there is such a description. Its basically a very thick cut of bacon that has been has the sauce mentioned above brushed on while being grilled. Love the combination of sweet and salty of the pork.

The Spicy Bacon Tempura. Cut up pieces of bacon dipped in a spicy tempura batter and deep fried to crispiness. Comes with a maple syrup type of sauce to dip in. Again, a nice combination of sweet and salty.

Cut Roll Combo. Your choice of any two regular rolls on the menu accompanied by cup of miso soup. My Roll choices were the Spicy Califonia Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll. Both are self explanatory and def had a bit of a spicy kick to it.

Service was excellent even though we were the only ones there. I assume if it was busier the service would be a bit slower but that's understandable.

Overall, I had a good experience but the only thing that might be a slight turnoff are the portions. Some of the items we had seemed tiny on the plates it came on. Other than that, the taste, service, and ambiance are all noteworthy.

{"text":"This is next door to my one of my favorite bakeries, Suzuya, so I decided to stop in and try them out prior to dessert. It was taco Tuesday, instead of going with the  Mexican route, I wanted Yellowtail Poke Tacos. These were really good, but 3 for $10 was a bit steep, they were really small and left me hungry, so I ordered the Sushi A combo, it came with 5 pieces of nigiri & california roll along with miso soup and a small salad for $8.50. Can't beat that! Ended the meal with Monaka Ice Cream, I've seen these at International Market, I'm sure that's where they are getting them, I doubt these are made in here. This wasn't a bad find, overall sushi wasn't bad, not the best. The setup was a bit bizarre, instead of having chairs up against the sushi bar, they have tables up against it, and then chairs around that? Different. Good luck to them, I always like to see local places succeed.

After thought-they have a restaurant.com voucher available."}
{"text":"I went here for a special event, so the restaurant was closed to outside guests and the traditional menu was not being served.  The restaurant was a great space to host the event, and it made for an intimate gathering. 

The food was delicious.  My favorite was a mini-taco station where we were able to make our own taco choosing from three delicious meat options.  Of course I tried, and loved them all.

My friends who booked the place rave about it, and even though the normal menu wasn't served, it's easy to see why they enjoy this place. I'll have to check it out when they are open for normal hours."}
{"text":"Off the strip and praised by many, I walked into Fish N Bowl with high expectations. Arriving just in time to order off an impressive happy hour menu  of over two dozen dishes, I tried some good and not-so-good items. 

First off, the bad... the oyster spoons ($5) were comprised of the worst oysters I've had in some time. The first was so bad I didn't bother eating the others. The taste, the smell... everything about it was bad.

Then there was the good... fluke crudo ($6.50) was simply prepared slices of fish topped with yuzu kosho and avocado combining for hints of sweetness and spice. Also containing a bit of spice were the FNB poke tacos ($8.50). Three small, crispy wonton shells were overflowing with fish, onions, mango, and jalapeño to create a contrast of flavors that all worked together.

Even though two out of there items were good, the third was so awful it left a bad taste in my mouth both literally and figuratively and I'd be reluctant to return."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW!! I've never been here, though have seen it tucked in a corner of shopping mall. I thought today, let's give a try.  First off, the menu is posted out front and the prices are phenomenal, makes it very convenient.  Secondly, the ladies at the front are absolutely lovely as is the chef, warm welcoming smiles, very pleasant and an overall peaceful vibe.  I've had a busy day an ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl but instead of rice (not a rice fan), they suggested the arugula salad and it came with Miso soup too!  Lastly ... Drum roll please ...  Let's just say, that I sat at my desk after a chaotic week and the food was amazing and fresh and so tasty!  It brought a smile to my face and made my afternoon.  I even called them to thank them and let them know how delicious it was.  

Please ... give this place a try!  You will enjoy!!

Namaste"}
{"text":"Cute little place...great for kids. High marks for friendly decor, awesome service, and very reasonable prices. The quality of the fish is not great but better than your average AYCE joint and a great value."}
{"text":"Extensive menu I ordered yellow tail poke tacos $10 for 3 small tacos o would call them taco sliders, definitely do not get tatziki  edamame. My third item I ordered was the scallop tostadas lacked flavor.
Fourth was a rice-less roll it was salmon topped with the house crab salad another flavorless choice. Bill was $52 and change.
I would say this place is over priced and lacks flavor you would do better to spend your money at SoHo instead."}
{"text":"Appearances can be deceiving! It looks like any other fast food place in an ordinary strip mall, and the name doesn't really give you a clue either.

Make no mistake, this is a gourmet fusion Japanese restaurant in disguise - except that you'd pay much more for this quality of food anywhere else!

The menu includes all the sushi, sashimi, and rolls you would expect. There is also a huge variety of salads, rice bowls, and noodles. Then there are the special creations like poke tacos, sashimi tostadas, special sashimi plates, and rice free rolls. Everything is wonderfully fresh, portions are generous, and service is attentive and friendly.

I've had so many great dishes that it's hard to single anything out. Try it out, and you'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"I am picky about sushi...fish n bowl has made my favorite list...excellent combinations and creative!"}
{"text":"I never thought this small sushi bar around the corner from my house would be so delicious.  Fish N Bowl is a quaint sushi bar on S. Durango behind a Sonic and near a Jiffy Lube.  Since it opened, we passed by without thinking of stopping in because of the size and location.  After a long day, we wanted sushi on the way home and were too far away from our usual all-you-can-eat place.  On a whim, we stopped by Fish N Bowl and were the first for dinner.  We were warmly greeted and our drinks and menus arrived quickly.

The restaurant is sweet, with nice decor and nice seating.  The walls have nice, big boards with unique rolls and desserts.  The tables even have suggestions for those new to sushi bar offerings.  The menu is unique in terms of appetizer and roll offerings.  The prices are also very reasonable.  We went ahead and started off with some familiar dishes and unique ones.  With the sushi and sashimi meal that I chose, I received some miso soup and a simple cabbage salad.

This salad looks simple, but the dressing is just fantastic.  It's a Kewpie and citrus salad dressing that's poured on just right so as to not soak the crunchy cabbage.  I ate the entire bowl and wanted more, but we had a few appetizers to go through before our main sushi meals.

The shrimp tempura arrived with something that I haven't seen before--salt and lemon.

I know what you're thinking, where's the ponzu?  Trust me--this only needed the salt and lemon to dip.  The tempura itself is crispy, seasoned well, and with some lemon to wet the tempura for the salt to stick, it makes a salty, citrus taste that doesn't make me miss the tempura sauce.  With this and the salad as a great start, I was looking forward to the pork belly. It isn't sauce-soaked or super tender, but it is perfect in every way.  I always look for that pork belly grilled just to the point where the fat renders, but still has that chew to it because that's what good pork belly is all about.  This is salty, nutty, and hearty.  I could eat four of these alone and be happy.

Last, but not least, was the unique offer on their apps list--tempura bacon with maple soy sauce.  It sounds weird, but it's so good.  Imagine, if you will, tempura for breakfast.  This would be the thing I'd taste when dreaming of something like tempura breakfast--a thinly sliced pork belly deep fried in a tempura batter that's super spicy, served with the craziest sauce--a maple soy dip.  It's like eating tempura pork belly pancakes that are spicy, sweet, salty, and crispy.  It melts in the mouth, has a good crispy exterior and a nice, soft pork belly interior.  The pieces are paper thin, making it easy to eat.  The best part is dipping each piece in that maple soy sauce, which is sweet and smokey, replicating that maple syrup and pancake experience, but in the weirdest and best way possible.  

Following my finger licking was a plate of nigiri and a few pieces of tuna sashimi. you don't choose what you are given for this combination, but who cares!  The nigiri is delicious and a great sample of the fish available to eat.  The tuna melts in the mouth, the yellowtail is delicious, and everything tastes fresh.  The rice was a bit hard in some pieces, but the flavors were there.  What a great meal for $10.50!

I never imagined that coconut shrimp, coconut flakes, avocado and yum yum sauce would ever go together, but this roll was absolutely tasty.  The crunchy shrimp inside had that hint of coconut flavor along with the coconut flakes, and the cream cheese with the avocado gave that creamy, filling flavor, with the yum yum sauce as a great tangy counterbalance to the richness of all the other ingredients.  The over textures and flavors were so surprising, and in the best way possible.  I would order this time and again because it had everything I love in one roll.  What a success.

I'm thankful that I can satisfy my cravings just by driving 2 minutes or less to Fish N Bowl, a sweet, small restaurant tucked away behind a Sonic and Jiffy Lube on S. Durango.  I hope it remains a tucked away secret so I am able to get a table as easily as I did today.  Shh--don't tell anyone I told you about Fish N Bowl.  Let's just keep this gem between you and me."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty aside from us and one other couple. Also, this place does not offer all you can eat sushi. This was a plus for me since I always think that the quality of the food is better in most cases. 

Spicy Bacon Tempura: This is one unique dish. I had bacon rolls before but not bacon tempura. What can I say? I love bacon and its flavor. I just did not like the oiliness of the dish. The bacon was fatty (I am not complaining!) and so frying it and putting batter around it made it a little too oily in my opinion. However, the sweet sauce that came with it balanced it out. I love anything sweet and salty.

Salmon Poke Tacos: The fish was fresh and the flavors were spot on. The fusion of the crunchy taco mixed with the mild Asian zing of the fish blend so well together. 

Salmon Rolls/Spicy Spider Rolls: The rolls that we tried all had wonderful flavors in it. The spider roll was just a regular spider roll. They were more than accommodating when I requested for it to be spicy. The rolls were fresh and the flavors were one of the best I've had. 

Grilled Salmon Bowl: One of my favorites yet! I love salmon and if you can cook salmon perfectly, I'm always sold on your establishment. The flavors were simple and yet extremely satisfying. The salmon was served with white rice and a side of sautéed mushroom and vegetables. It was cooked in a sweet sauce that blends well with the saltiness of the fish. One of the best salmon I had! I just inhaled that thing like crazy. The portion was a good amount. But because it was so good, it kept me wanting more.

What a wonderful find! This place is located near Skinnyfats on Durango. I've passed by this place so many times without realizing it. I highly recommend that you check out this place."}
{"text":"The fish is very fresh and rice is well made. Prices have gone up bit recently but quality is still good. Rolls are a bit smaller than I'm used to. Lots of different combinations but I like  straight up sushi and sashimi best. There's no longer a menu on Yelp. I suggest Fish and Bowl put one up. 
The place is intimate and well lit.  The decor is very modern with a nice atmosphere. It's also very clean. 
A rolling video beautifully shows all the dishes available which is very helpful. 
Staff is very friendly especially the wait staff and cashiers. 
I gave four stars only because the rolls could be a bit bigger. 
There was no wait to be seated this Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is great! NOT AYCE sushi menu. Quality of the rolls and nigiri are worth it. I also leave full, happy, spend as much as the AYCE places."}
{"text":"i'd probably give them a 3.5 rating if that was available.

the food is decent. Some items didn't seem high quality or fresh. I've gone back a couple of times, but i've never walked out impressed. 

if i'm in the area and craving some quick sushi type foods, then i'll go here, but i wont' go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Fish n Bowl is a hidden Japanese restaurant located along Durango and Warm Springs (beside Sonic Burger). From outside you wouldn't know that it's a Japanese restaurant.

The place is clean and very bright. The decorations are very Japanese. 

We ordered the following:

Fried Octopus Salad Bowl - I loved the yuzu salad dressing. Everything blended well with this entree. My only complaint is the price. The salad was not very much and they put it in a giant bowl, with a few pieces of fried octopus. The octopus was cooked well. For $9.50, it looks over-priced.

Bacon Tempura- My favorite among all the dishes we ordered.  It came probably with approximately 8 pieces of small cut bacon with tempura batter. The batter was really good since it had seasoning on it. A must try and something different. 

Cajun Albacore Nigiri - the fish was fresh and seasoned well. The fish was also a good size. 

Rock n Roll - again, the fish was fresh. The presentation was pretty. The flavor was good. 

Hamachi Taco - I guess this is the most famous dish. It was good but there's a tad sweetness that comes with it that doesn't seem to go along with the dish. My bf said it was probably from the red onions. 

Spicy Hamachi Roll - pretty good size for the price, 8 pieces for $4.50. Average roll.

Ginger Ice Cream - something unique and good. It's a good palate cleanser. 

Service was awesome. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! We had the bacon tempera, diakon radish salad, yellowtail tacos, Cajun albacore and kalbi bowl. All good! For dessert we had monaka ice cream. We will be coming back :) the service was very friendly and prompt too!"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in Vegas hands down!!! Great service!!! They have even gave us a free dessert just because we got our marriage certificate!!! Pork belly and uni in a spoon is to die for!!! Everything is great and fresh!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"it was saturday night at 8p and we decided to give this rest restaurant a try as we have driven by it many times.  we walked in and it was completely empty; probably a ominous sign.  i ordered some sushi rolls.  the rice on the sushi tasted stale; almost like the sushi you purchase at a grocery store which has been sitting there for a few days.  food was completely bland and very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the quality is top notch, the food and presentation is to die for! This will be my new Friday spot. Check it out you wont regret it. Oh one last thing spicy bacon tempura that is all."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting sushi restaurant way out in no-man's land on Durango Dr.  It is a very intimate environment with a few tables all with sight of the kitchen.  

I went for Happy Hour during the week and everything was very affordable.  I tried the edamame and a few sushi platters.  All was very delicious, all was very affordable, all displayed solid quality.  One of the platters I ordered (the sashimi) was on par with higher range sushi restaurants as far as quality and cut of the fish. 

Don't overlook this place by it's look.  It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center and you wouldn't guess its tastiness from first sight.  Try it if you're in the area or want to make the drive out.  I recommend coming at Happy Hour and trying a bunch of items a la carte rather than order a full meal."}
{"text":"Excellent! This is a true keeper and a must try! 

The restaurant is clean, modern and new with a casual atmosphere inviting of most any discerning sushi fanatic like myself. The service is top notch with no detail left out.

The food quality is superior to most and the preparation with garnish and presentation excellent. It was complimented by a happy hour on rolls to keep the appetite in check.

Shall return soon and ready to leave the AYCE crowded stops and return to quality. I must add the prices are more than reasonable, so the pocketbook will be as happy as you are eating here."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Tacos are out of this world, salad was big and great quality. Going to do take out next time to avoid the fried tempura cheesecake. (So good!)"}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab a quick lunch before heading back to the dmv (what a drag!) . I was first skeptical by the look of the restaurant. Very clean and new but a way different look than most sushi bars.

My sushi roll was surprisingly really delicious and fresh! Also their seaweed salad was pickled perfectly and came in a huge portion.

Wish I lived closer to FnB.. Good food at a very affordable price !"}
{"text":"great service with great food .... love their Tuna tacos and desserts!!! the Bento box was great for 1 person..."}
{"text":"Have passed this place almost everyday on my way home. Finally stopped to try it and so glad I did. I've ordered a couple of the different specialty rolls from the menu and all have been great as well as the poke tacos. I have dined in and have ordered food to go. Great service and always fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the Bacon Tempura & the Pork Belly.  They both felt & looked undercooked. Very concerning & disappointing for a pork lover. I knew something didn't seem right when I picked up my order, the chef looked really nervous. Very strange vibes from him, but the hostess was nice.  The food looks nothing like the pictures, in fact the pork dishes looked microwaved then tossed in sauce.  Hmmm."}
{"text":"Lack of flavor in the salad, the fish smelled fishy and the portion was just mediocre. I am not coming back and I do not recommend this place to anybody! There's some other businesses that will give me more for my business. 2 stars for service."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were craving something that didn't have red meat (since we've been trying to cut down), so we stumbled upon this place on yelp. 

First off I must say, the chef was friendly and had great service! We started off with the oyster in a spoon and seaweed salad. Oysters were delicious that was basking in a ramekin full of ponzu sauce. Then we went onto the lollie rice Bowl which had crab,  shrimp, masago, lettuce, and rice. Very well rounded and delicious. 

Sushi was superb, had 2 orders of yellowtail nigiri, each a different cut of the fish. Had a couple of rolls, eel and the philly. The amount they gave was good (8 pcs.) compared to the price ($4.50).

We had an off the menu dessert - the monaka - green tea ice cream with red bean inside of a wafer. Oiishi! 

Total bill - $43
Satisfaction: obtained

10/10 would eat again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lot of food and it was really great, so I came back today! But this time I had a problem with THE OWNER. How freaking rude was the owner?? ASF. 

I came in with my son and he can't have any drink with too much sugar or caffeine! So he has his own little drink that he brings with him all the time.
So after we order, we sit down and my son opens his drink. The owner walks over to us YELLING??? \"HEY HEY HEY!!! YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT IN HERE, YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME BEFORE YOU OPENED THAT!!!\"

Have some shame. Both me and my husband ordered a drink. What does it matter my 6y/o son has his own!?

Wow. Just wow. Such a great way to approach a customer who appreciated your food, enough to come back.

Don't believe me? Ask the owner yourself. 
It's a shame you have no professionalism.

So yeah, ordered 50$+ worth of food and left without touchig our food (we had some more coming too). I don't even care, keep my money. :-)"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, but the downfall was the wait time for your rolls between rolls. You would finish one roll and would wait another 5-10 minutes for your next order to come to your table. I prefer to make the drive to sushi fever"}
{"text":"I come here all the time it's near by my house and the only sushi that's tasty. It's not ayce but I'm so addicted to the uni spoon it's so good I can probably eat like 100 but I always get 2 orders at a time"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by on Easter and we were so glad we did. There weren't a lot of people there, but - it was Easter - and there were two other tables who came in while we were there.
My sister and I wanted Japanese food - NOT just sushi - but Japanese food (we're halfsies). For some people, Japanese food means only sushi, but there's a lot more; trust me. 
While their menu is far from traditional, we were able to get plenty of food that was 'outside the (sushi) box' and we loved everything. The salmon skin rolls seemed pricier than most places, but once it came out, we knew why - it was huge! You're definitely getting your money's worth with that one.
Their miso soup had a distinctly different flavor, but it is good.
I found their prices to be reasonable and although the place is not large, I think it would be good for groups, if only for the fact that you'll want to try a lot of different things and sharing here would be really fun (and tasty). 
I've included some pics of the menu and food but don't judge their food negatively if you think they're bad - 1) I'm not a food photographer, and 2) they were taken with my iPhone."}
{"text":"I had this spot bookmarked and opted to swing by for lunch. This sushi cafe (small as other reviews stated) is centrally located in the SW of Vegas - off of Durango and 215- and close to my work.

I popped by on a Friday afternoon and they offered to sit me at a table right away. They had a few tables open during the lunch rush. I took a peek at the menu and was immediately drawn to their lunch 'box' special. I didn't really give any attention to their regular menu so I can't offer any advice there. However, the lunch special price was $9.50+ tax - done and done! 

They have you select one HOT option and one COLD option. I opted for the Tempura Veggies (HOT) and Spicy Tuna (COLD) for my choices. I also ordered edamame to munch  on while I waited for my main dish.  Within 5 mins, I was served my edamame and miso soup (included in the special- it was tasty for miso).  My main dish was served promptly after that. I appreciate a place that can serve speedy quality food. This is especially true when you're on your afternoon lunch break. 

The lunch 'box' special was broken up into 4 sections (see photo). Section 1: The veggie tempura.  It was delish! The veggies weren't soggy and it wasn't overly breaded. I liked that they served it with lemon wedges and sea salt on the side. Section 2: My spicy tuna roll was just as scrumptious. Not a hard roll to screw up- but it was done right. Section 3: Cucumber salad- fresh thinly sliced cucumbers with a vinegar based dressing. It was crispy and crunchy- just as cucumbers should be. Section 4: rice. Yup, a scoop of white rice. Not much else to say. Throw some soy sauce on it and get at it.

Overall, I was impressed with my lunch for the value and service. Everything was super fresh and it's nice to try a different lunch spot. I was a happy camper when all was said and done. I will be bringing some fellow coworkers back for a future lunch visit."}
{"text":"Very good fresh fish!! I am very picky because I'm from San Diego but I really liked this place"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Super friendly service , and an expert sushi chef. Tons of choices. 
Tonight we tried the yellowtail crispy rice ( the avocado is a great touch ) , salmon skin hand roll was the best I've ever had... Tons of flavor and extra crispy skin. 
Also the Lolli rice is delicious ( rice ,crab, shrimp,scallion and masago ) 
Lastly the rock n roll with no rice melts in your mouth. 
So happy to have this great neighborhood sushi spot."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! Great lunch combos and sushi was fresh . My new favorite lunch spot :-)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the southwest with by far the best prices! The staff is so friendly they remember us every time we come. The poke tacos are by far the best thing on the menu (well at least from everything I've tried)."}
{"text":"This place is really good, I have tried about 6 different items and I thought they were all tasty.   I kind of don't want anyone to know about it because it's like my little secret, oh we'll secret out!  Good food should be recognized! ENJOY!
The pork belly is good
Bacon tempura amazing!!
Tacos are nice and crispy
And the chef is nice and so is the lady that always serves us. Kind of seems like a 2 man team everytime I go. Just love this place."}
{"text":"This place is a sushi Gold mine! Creative rolls and a wide assortment of rice for your rules for my gluten-free people. Fresh fish basics and tasty combos."}
{"text":"Really great service and the food was excellent. Had the shrimp tacos, beef meatballs, XXX roll, rainbow roll, Mexican roll, cucumber salad, and the tempura ice cream. Favorites was the XXX roll and the meatballs. Definitely glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"Four of us met to have dinner at Chef Howard Choi's restaurant in the southwest section of town.  One of the group had arranged for Chef Choi to do an omakase dinner for our party and we ended with a wide variety of dishes over the 15 courses.  The items served were:

Cucumber and seaweed salad
Japanese curry spicy edamame
Spoon trio of oyster, uni, and scallop
Spicy tempura bacon
Salmon kama
Hamachi kama
Taco trio of shrimp, salmon, and tuna
Agedashi tofu
Soft shell crab cake
5 piece nigiri selection
Warm Springs roll
Mr. Monkey \"nigiri\"
Double E--freshwater eel over rice with shredded egg
Miso
Green tea
Cheesecake tempura

I have had this place bookmarked for many months.  Starting with a small salad, some edamame, and followed by the spoon trio, the opening courses were smaller beginnings to a good amount of food.  The edamame was coated with Japanese curry and had a really good flavor.  The pods were tender enough to eat whole rather than strip out the beans like I always have to do.

Then came one of the biggest winners of the night and a reason to go back just for this--spicy tempura bacon with a maple and soy reduction.  This was something not seen in any restaurant I've been at before and it was really good. 

Two grilled fish courses followed that were a mixed bag.  The salmon was done too much but the hamachi was sweet and juicy.

A trio of small plates came next with a spicy soft shell crab cake, a trio of tacos, and a bowl of agedashi tofu.  Hands down winner was the trio of tacos made from egg roll skins and filled with shrimp, tuna, and salmon.  Each one was different in flavor and the tuna poke was superb!

Next up were five pieces of nigiri, a roll, and another \"nigirI' of quite a different stripe.  The Warm Springs roll, one of several rice free rolls on the menu, with spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, and shrimp with avocado in a rice paper wrapper with eel sauce was very good and a different kind of roll.  The Mr. Monkey, listed as a roll but I refer to it as a special kind of nigiri, with the normal rice layer being a fried banana which is topped with spicy crab and then topped with the spicy tuna.  Very creative and very tasty.

The Double E bowl was good but the eel was overwhelmed by the amount of rice below.  The shredded egg was an interesting take for a topping.

Some light miso to end and then it was dessert.  The tempura cheesecake with chocolate and caramel sauces was excellent.  Creamy and fried perfectly, it's another reason to return.

Chef Choi was a very genial, soft-spoken host and he explained his roots and how he came to being a sushi chef.

This is a small restaurant tucked in the corner of a small strip mall next to a Sonic Drive-in.  One could easily drive by and not know it's there.  Just plan to go there."}
{"text":"Craving sushi at lunchtime so we popped in here. 

Very quiet little place. Only about 8 tables and a strange glass case in the front. Clearly, this was something else previously.

We ordered a mini bowl from the lunch specials for our little guy. $6.50 for a rice, veggies and bulgogi along with a miso soup. It was certainly a good deal and tasty! The veggies were shredded ultra thin and there was good flavor. 

We ordered 2 special rolls and another lunch special that included 2 regular rolls and a miso soup for $8.50. Again, a good deal! All 4 of our rolls were very good. Rolled nicely, generous on the fish, and pretty presentation. 

There were lots of interesting items in the menu and I would certainly return to try more things! They had several rolls that were out of the ordinary. Hubby was intrigued by the uni trio listed on the board.  We enjoyed lunch for three with a little leftover for $38. Not bad at all. The service was very attentive but we were the only ones there so it should have been."}
{"text":"Still a huge fan - I've now also had the tonkatsu bowl and kalbi bowl, and everything's been amazing."}
{"text":"This is based on their food alone as I stopped by for take out. Granted I JUST ate at skinny fats... fish N bowl is not in my hood so I had to get some to go! It was my birthday weekend so what ever!

I got the 3 poké tacos-salmon and a spicy salmon rice bowl. It came with a miso soup. It came out to just over $22- kinda steep IMHO.

When I got home the \"taco\" shell wasn't as crisp as I know it was before but it was delicious! Plus that was my fault. Their poke recipe is on point. The pineapple mixed in, the spice, the fish eggs? Perfect. 

The spicy salmon rice bowl was crack. I couldn't stop eating it. The flavors were just spot on. The rice was perfect. It was just perfect.

I hope to dine in next time. The prices were a little high, but the server was very helpful and nice. The restaurant was nice, but it had an off smell."}
{"text":"My buddy mentioned he just recently had some Bacon Tempura at this place, so i figured I'd give it a try.  Both my feet were pretty much inside the door after i previewed some of their pics yelp:  Poke Tacos and Green Tea Soba Salad.  Say no more.  

After skimming through their menu only a few items caught my attention.  It's basically a sushi restaurant ala cart with extra offerings such as rice bowls and other interesting appetizers. 

Green Tea Soba Salad with Shrimp and Ginger Soy Sauce:  This was a simple, cold dish where the dressing was heavy enough to slightly overwhelm the sweetness and aroma of the cha-soba.  Nevertheless it was refreshing and easy to enjoy esp on warmer days. 4/5

Spicy Bacon Tempura:  Value wise this was plentiful and delish.  I'd recommend splitting this with a party of 2 or more unless you really, really love bacon.  Better to enjoy when they arrived as the tempura loses it's crunch.  The sweet sauce paired well. 4/5

Yellowtail Poke Tacos:  Our chef suggested this was the favorite of the others tacos (tuna, salmon, and snappers.)  A little heavy on the wasabi aoili, but that's ok because it was counter with a generous amount of Black Tobiko as well.  Don't share this dish unless you really like your friend.  4.5/5

Uni on a spoon:  Another Chef's suggestion.  I wouldn't normally order Uni anywhere unless Chef's recommend it.  Even so I was under the impression that one ordered would be a spoonful but it came in three's.  Dressed in lemon juice and sea salt i was able to knock down two.  A personal achievement, but still not an Uni Fan.  No rating 

Lastly we finished off with Monaka Ice Cream which is a waffle filled with Green Tea Ice Cream and Azuki Bean.  I don't believe this was made in house, but it was still really good. 4.5/5  

Overall i enjoyed F&B.  We ordered Sashimi and stuff, and everything served to us were fresh.  But i was hoping of some more creative dishes to try since their menu had an abundant amount of items.  Limited amount of seating.. I think i saw 7 tables?? Would come back if im around the neighborhood.

Server is shy but attentive.. 10 days and counting lol"}
{"text":"Delicious we had spicy Hirame  spicy yellowtail sashimi plate.  We reorder them.  
We also tried Kali bowl tender rib meat with a sweet tangy sauce.  Family owned."}
{"text":"My second time here, now with my wife and we both like the salmon bowl. 
The food come fast and they make sure it will taste good as well.
Very good place to eat ! 
I like it"}
{"text":"Great \"neighborhood\" restaurants are a scarcity in our area of Durango and Mountain's Edge, so Fish N Bowl is a godsend. Visited for the first time a few days ago and was thrilled with the results. This is a simple, unpretentious Japanese/Sushi joint. The emphasis is on ingredients and execution, with a refreshing absence of trendiness. Favorite dishes included the Salmon Kama (collar; full of succulent meat), Noodle Cucumber Salad (though a splash or two of acid was needed), and the Touchdown Roll. The latter was suggested by our waitress, and thankfully so. I don't usually get excited about rolls, but the Touchdown is an awesome combination of spices, textures, and colors--creamy, spicy, soft, crunchy, dark, bright. There are whole sections of the menu we didn't get a chance to explore, so a return visit will be happening soon.

It's worth mentioning that this place closes at 9pm even on a Saturday. They also don't serve alcohol, and my sweetie complained about the lack of chairs with backs; just a few tables and benches (hence three stars instead of four). This is not an all-night or late night hangout, it's a pop in for a killer meal before a night out, or order-ahead and take-home kind of deal (several pick-up customers came and went during our meal). Easy, casual, friendly, with an emphasis on quality preparations, and dinner for two clocking in around fifty bucks: We'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, quaint restaurant with some basic and delicious dishes. It's small with about 25 seats or so, and one chef.  We surprised the chef by bringing half our office here and spending a couple hours trying everything they had. Understandably he was swamped but he still delivered good food at a good price. 

I tried: 
Uni in a spoon - fresh, tasty, great price
Pork Belly - the meat itself is tender, but the flavor is okay - too much of the burnt marinade taste for my liking
Bacon Tempura - actually pretty tasty
Tacos (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Snapper) - 3 bite-sized tacos to an order, yellowtail was my favorite
Salmon Ochazuke - Excellent. I'll come back just for this.
Branzino (Weekly Special) - It was marinated in dill, grilled so the skin was extra crispy, served on peppers and onions, and was delectable. Perfectly cooked.
Warm Springs roll - I normally don't like rice paper rolls but this is great. 

Overall this restaurant has fresh fish, good service, and some great morsels to try. I'll be coming here for lunch more often!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of the last business that was in this location, but it sucked.  I guess because of that, I didn't even think about coming in here until I saw the Yelp rating.  I'm glad I did.  The hamachi tacos were great.  I could eat about a dozen of those for starters.  The tonkatsu was ok, nothing special.  They had a bunch of other stuff on the menu that looked good, but I'll have to wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has caught my eye and I've been wanting to try it for awhile. It's a small place but I liked the ambiance. There were only two people other people there so there was no wait on a Friday night. I didn't know exactly what to expect except I knew there was fish. 

The menu had a lot of different options from appetizers, salad, rolls and sashimi. If your kid doesn't like sushi or seafood this is not the place to take them as there is no other option like tempura udon, etc.  We started off with the uni spoon, oyster spoon and pork belly. My favorite was the uni spoon! It was creamy and delicious. Who knew I would like gonads so much?! ;) the oysters had a nice flavor to it too but I preferred the uni. The pork belly was super super fatty. It was good for what it was but I felt like I was consuming so much fat! Now the chirashi bowl had nice big cuts of fish! The fish was good, but I do wish they put a lil more rice for those hungry hippos like me. 

Overall, the experience was great. Customer service was good and everything came out fairly quickly. We left spending about $50 bucks for everything which is about average on sushi. I would def come back though."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Every time it's very good. The fish tastes fresh and their menu is not overwhelmingly big. 

Our server is very attentive and happy to help. 

I usually get the chirashi bowl and its perfect amount of sashimi and rice. The rolls are good and their hamachi kama is very tasty. 

My only complaint is when ordering to go its hard because they dont have a menu online or in yelp that makes it easy. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A quaint spot that has some awesome dishes.  it's appropriately priced and the employees are so nice and prompt!  I enjoyed each of my visits."}
{"text":"Wow, wish I would have found this place sooner! Some of the best sushi I've ever had. The place is clean and quaint. Service was on point and the food was the best. We had 3 giant specialty rolls, 2 apps, and drinks all for under $45! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop in last night and I am SO glad I did. This is such a cute little seafood/sushi joint. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was absolutely exceptional!!!  And very fair pricing for the size of the portions. Fish-N-Bowl is my new favorite restaurant. I will pass on AYCE sushi from now on and stop in here instead. MUCH higher quality than I've had elsewhere in town. Don't sleep on this hidden little gem in SW."}
{"text":"Went in for a later lunch with our young kids. Good service and the food was amazing. The spicy garlic edamame WOW!  We got three sushi rolls that were great and the yellowtail poki salad was one of my favorites. We will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"I love this place! My new favorite sushi spot in town. Everything is delicious and the customer service is on point."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good despite the location. Uni and oyster in spoon is very good. Although the restaurant state it is a fusion style restaurant but some items are pretty authentic. Chef is very friendly especially to kids. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Everything I tried in this place was amazing. Highly recommend this place. I had the pork belly which was amazing. Also I had the sex on the beach roll which was so flavorful. Lastly had the poke tacos and those we're very good too. I'm a pretty honest critic when it comes to fish type dishes and I was blown away."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great customer service and amazing food. This is not an AYCE restaurant fyi. But if you want fresh fish and great Japanese food I would definitely give this spot a try."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with friends and it was awesome.  The place is really bright with color and smells great inside.  Lunch special was great.  Service was on top of everything.  Very nice. Chicken rice bowl was the best I've had in a while.  My friends said the sushi was awesome.  Spicy tuna was the best."}
{"text":"Really great place! All the food was amazing, The Tuna & Jalapeno  sashimi is a must have. The green tea was very good, try it!

I really appreciate the service that I received. It was fast and the server really went out of her way to provide great service. I also appreciate the Chef's effort to appease our picky son's taste buds with the sticky rice he brought. Customer service and food quality through the roof!

We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Gooooood food in this restaurant! Thanks! Only empty plates to show, is because everything was extremely delicious:)
Next time I will make photos before I tough it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fish n Bowl caught me by surprise!  Just in time for lent too.  Although I did come here on a day I could bite into the spicy bacon appetizer.  It's like crispy bacon chips and I've concluded that it would be good paired with the ginger ice cream. I'm going to try that combination when I go there for next time.  

My hubs and I always want to try a little of everything and I think we did, except they forgot to take our taco order!  It's okay, the amount of food they give you is a lot and you actually start to get full when trying all the dishes.  I did sashimi, the salads, appetizers and dessert.  I did the sashimi salad and you get a lot.  It's a full serving of a salad for one person and the garlic ponzu sauce is delicious and spicy.  You really get your money's worth!

Service was great but it is a tiny spot.  Think a tiny cafe size.  Can't wait to return and try another good dish!"}
{"text":"This place is about 5 minutes from our house and i ALWAYS pass by it with my commute to work. It's kind of located in a teeny little plaza that includes a bakery and nail salon but whatever because it's DELICIOUS. The owner/chef was there with a really sweet waitress. I think we came in about an hour and a half before they close but they were still so accommodating. They had top 40 music playing on an iPod dock and my bf really appreciated the tv's that were on ESPN (lol!) The restaurant has a modern vibe with light colored wood floors and brightly colored walls. It's minimal and CLEAN. Just how I like my restaurants to be. 

We ordered their F&B Roll, yellowtail tacos, a rice bowl (rice, some kind of meat-forgot what it was,sorry!!, and their cabbage salad), and the monaka ice cream.

Yellowtail Tacos: OMG. I could eat these everyday of my life. The fish was lightly coated in a creamy wasabi sauce with crispy cabbage and black sesame seeds. I don't exactly know what seasoning they used or what they mixed the wasabi with but the whole thing was SOOOO good. The only bad thing i can say about them is the fact they only come with three to an order :( I would eat like.... 9237965. 

F&B Roll: What the heck is there not to like about this. Fresh coconut shavings, coconut shrimp and cream cheese (loved the fact that there wasn't an obnoxious amount because cream cheese could get ugly.....fast). Perfect rice to filling ratio. Quite possibly the best roll i've ever had the pleasure of consuming. I'm a fan of coconut sooooo if you're not, then don't order it. More for me!  :D

Bowl: I completely forgot what meat was in this (thats what midterms will do to you) but I just remember it being SO flavorful and tender! The rice was perfect and the cabbage salad was dainty but with that sauce they top it off with, YUUUM. 

Monaka Ice Cream: green tea ice cream and red bean paste enveloped in a crispy mochi pocket. UMMM yes. 

As we were walking out, the owner asked how everything was and we assured him we will be back for more and he told us to order their bacon tempura next time. Their what?!? BACON TEMPURA. we almost sat back down just order to it, lol."}
{"text":"I had the yellowtail roll as an appetizer, grilled salmon rice bowl for main course and monaka for dessert. I never had monaka before. It's almost like Japanese ice cream sandwich and very tasty. Everything was very good. Portion sizes were nice but I had no leftovers. I will definitely be back, although based on the prices, not sure I can afford to go as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"I did takeout and ordered based on yelp reviews...I am SO happy. I tried the Cherry Blossom and the Salmon Poke Tacos-amazing. Having no-rice options is great, and the flavors were just wonderful. The tacos were spicy (just right) and the cherry blossom came with a lot of crab!! I cannot wait to try more from their menu...and maybe dine in too."}
{"text":"Eaten here and couple of times and just now remembering to post a review if you aren't up for AYCE but want good sushi there combo specials are really good and decently filling for a reasonable price 3 hand rolls or 2 rolls and soup and you're still under $15 with a specialty drink. Good service good food."}
{"text":"They always greet you once you walk through the door! It's a small place so there's very few workers & it's pretty much the same people every time. 

I've had a couple of rolls and they've been awesome! My favorite items on the menu are the salmon poke salad & the salmon poke tacos! THEYRE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! 

The service is always good, I mean there are only a couple of tables to wait on. I would say it's a tad pricey but what sushi type place isn't?"}
{"text":"Ahi was ridiculously spicy and when we told the waitress she said that's how their ahi is. Super mediocre fish. Horrible service. Gross salad dressing. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Place was small and clean. Food was well prepared. Poke Tacos are a MUST! Sushi is small but that's ok. I would recommend this place for lunch versus dinner unless you want a bite that's not so filling. I ordered 9 items for a family of 4 and we were not full at all. I would go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! 

This place always hits the spot when I am craving something light and fresh. The owners are the cutest couple and have begun to recognize my order every time I call in. Which is rare for a restaurant, and why it is so awesome! 
Their food is always on point. I typically order the Crispy Rice with Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Pork Belly, and a Kalbi Bowl. Yes I finish it all and Yes it's the same order everytime! When I do dine in I always love trying their newer menu items, but when it comes down to placing a to go order, it's always the same because they never go wrong. 

The inside of the restaurant is absolutely adorable. It is a small space but they make the best of it. My favorite is the cash-out section. All the toys and lego's make it so unique. There is even a mini sushi restaurant doll house on the counter that SHE made! Such talent. Def. a must see while you are in there. 

Well this review made me want to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Went in during lunch, staff was very friendly and courteous. I had the yellowtail tacos which were awesome. But if your eating there for the first time, the size of the tacos are not the regular taco size. They are just the perfect 2 bite size. Also had the uni spoons and they were good. And to finish off the meal I indulged in the sexy and wild you know to keep up my persona. It was good really vinegary but still good."}
{"text":"Located between Jiffy lube and Sonic. 
Super clean, friendly staff, fast and delicious food! 
I tried Uni spoons, spicy bacon tempura, yellowtail & serrano, curry edamame, fnb poke rice bowl, spicy sashimi rice bowl and salmon poke taco.
Definitely must check out this place!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp tempura is the best here!! Light, and crispy!  Salad bowl with salmon is very yummy...  We will always come back!"}
{"text":"First place I had ever tried a poke bowl and I am so glad I tried it here. A friend took me here and we ordered the FNB poke bowl. At first I was a little hesitant about having mango in the dish but turns out, the mango actually gave the dish a nice sweet contrast. The sauce they placed in the bowl was yummy and since I love spicy food, the jalapeños in the dish was a thumbs up for me. The only other bowl I had here was the spicy tuna bowl. It was good as well but nothing special. I would definitely stick with the FNB poke bowl."}
{"text":"Got their poke rice bowl.  Pretty good! I feel like it needed some more sesame oil or soy sauce maybe.  I enjoyed it but felt like it was missing something.  

The oyster spoons were the best part.  They tasted so fresh and the sauce was delicious.  
 If I'm nearby I'll probably come back :)"}
{"text":"I had the poke tacos for the first time. It was very good and the waitresses were very nice and courteous. The environment was very clean and calm. It's a cute little restaurant. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"3.5

The first time we came here the service was soooooooooooooo slow and the server was a bit awkward,.. We ordered a bunch of things and nothing stood out and the sashimi was not that fresh..

Fast forward to my most recent visit... The service improved tremendously! Food came out at a good pace and the same server was on her A game.. I tried the uni trio which was $15 and well worth it! Comes with uni sashimi, uni potsticker and uni hand roll... The uni was fresh and I thought it was super creative to put it in potsticker form..

My only gripe with this place would be that prices seem to be reasonable but the portions are pretty small.. My boyfriend ordered the Galbi bowl on our most recent visit and he could definitely not get full on that alone!

But I will be back for the uni trio!!! YUMMMM"}
{"text":"come for lunch and try the following items... see pictures, it is a small place, service ok, they have different lunch special every day"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My fav sushi spot in vegas.

It's a small family owned spot that deserves your visit. 

The butter garlic white fish and yellow tail poke tacos are my 2 go to items."}
{"text":"Yummy food and amazing service.  I wish there was one in Henderson.  Will definitely drop by again when I'm in the area.  Their happy hour menu is great!"}
{"text":"Fish n Bowl has been an easy choice for a casual meal with the kids in tow. It's a small restaurant with seating for about less than 30, only having 6-7 tables. Chef Howard Choi (of RM Seafood) is in charge and can always be found behind the sushi bar. 

They have a large menu, but we mainly skip all the fancy rolls. We usually order from the poke salad bowls and the rice bowls. Some of our favorites include the Chirashi, Roe Festival Salad, Spicy Sashimi Bowl (sans the Korean spicy sauce), and Popping Rice Bowl. The Roe Festival is a beauty to see with all the various fish eggs coloring the bowl. If I could order that on a bowl of sushi rice, that would be so bomb!

I love their Uni Spoons and the Hamachi Collar is a large portion and yummy. The Soft Shell Crab Tempura is a favorite for the Little Guy. The Agedashi Tofu was unmemorable though.

The Matcha Affogato is a nice way to end the meal too. 

I really love how super casual and relaxed I feel when I eat here. Blame it on the quaint size or what, but this place has definitely made it into our rotation for family meals out. They are closed on Tuesdays, which I discovered when I pulled up hungry on a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"IGreat food, fresh, good service, clean, ample parking. We ordered the warm springs roll, salmon taco, sushi and sashimi, and the rock and roll. Everything was good and the low price made it even better."}
{"text":"FGreat sushi especially if you want sushi or rolls that are without the rice. Unusual combinations Loved the veggie roll no rice and added fish.  Very healthy and tasty. Fish quality 4 For those who live in mountains edge here's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Why eat fast food when you can have sushi! Always taste fresh, everything is made on the spot. Super quick service, nice people, I've never been disappointed! Try the crispy rice with tuna or salmon, yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here on a whim since it's near my house. All 3 rolls we ordered were fresh and yummy. The f&b paradise roll was amazing, I'd go back just for that. Our order was ready fast and the employees working when I picked up were friendly."}

Born in Iowa, raised in Korea, and slicing up fish in Southwest Las Vegas, Howard Choi's is most certainly is not the most typical of Chef's stories, but garnering praise from locals and critics alike it was with modestly high expectations that a party of four sat on uncomfortable benches inside of Fish N Bowl on Saturday evening, the two-hour omakase experience showing a great diversity of tastes and textures with most of them quite good.

At first hesitant to serve 'chef's choice,' the small restaurant on South Durango doing the majority of its business at lunch, happy hour, and with orders a la carte it was entirely from creations on the laminated flippable menu that fifteen course was crafted, a selection of water and teas added to a tally of just over $300 all-in for the table.

Bringing in fresh fish \"almost every day but Sunday\" from a variety of sources, including the ones that provide products to more pricey locations on The Strip, the Fish N Bowl experience crafted by Choi began with shredded seaweed glistening with sesame oil followed by edamame so tender that pods did not need to be discarded, the curry playing well of the acid from the salad while preparing the palate for bold flavors to come.

Doing an excellent job of presenting a broad view of appetizers by offering three individual 'spoons,' each typically offered as a trio, even those averse to oysters would be well advised to reassess with FNB's version lightened by ponzu, heat, plus tobiko and although both the scallop and urchin were also well accompanied the first true 'wow' of the evening was provided by crispy breaded bacon fully awash with spices, the maple-infused soy sauce doing an admirable job of reining them all in.

Unfortunately hitting a speed bump with Salmon cooked a bit too long it was with a more appropriately grilled piece of Yellowtail that the kitchen quickly regained its footing, another raw followup served straight across the counter from Chef Choi's hands perhaps the best six mouthfuls of the evening with each two-bite 'taco' out-'Nobuing' Matsuhisa, the Ono said by one to be the best tasted outside the Hawaiian Islands.

Receiving lightly fried tofu in fish broth at the request of one diner, the flavor and texture far more appealing than the makeshift crabcake that tasted almost entirely of peppers that followed, it was a plate of five slices of fish atop rice that arrived subsequently, the fluke a touch overwhelmed by citrus while both scallop and ahi were undeniably excellent, the former particularly vibrant beneath both grated and crispy garlic.

Not generally one to order rolls, but happy to let Choi try to change my mind, suffice it to say that although texturally compelling the Warm Springs Roll got a little lost in all the spices while the clever Mr. Monkey was a fun little bite to recalibrate the palate, savory courses ending in a bowl of brown rice topped with tender eel in its sauce and shavings of egg omelet.

Washing it all down with smooth miso as hot green tea better than that at Mizumi was on it's way, desserts consisted of a cloud-like concoction from nearby Suzuya alongside the restaurant's very own tempura fried cheesecake, the former forgettable albeit tasty while the latter was absolutely decadent alongside pools of caramel, chocolate, and a dollop of whipped cream.

Pairing the passion of it's Chef/Owner with a sizable menu and plenty of well-sourced fish,  Howard Choi's Fish N Bowl is the sort of 'locals-only' place that deserves the support of anyone interested in Japanese cuisine, the relatively low price point and cozy confines speaking to a world far removed from the touristy trappings of The Strip."}
{"text":"Food are delicious.... I plan to eat just sushi and ended up eating taco sushi, 2 round of spoon uni, cucumber and 2 round of rolls... yummy... definitely, will come back soon :)"}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted sushi so, I came here. It's a very small place that can only seat about 20-30 people. I love the display in their glass counter once you walk in. Totoro, sushi and Lego Yoda - these are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm fee...

They have specials on the board behind the sushi bar. Their items are ala carte. Sorry, AYCE fans.

Uni Trio:
Uni in a spoon, uni dumpling and uni handroll. If you like uni, you'll appreciate having uni served three ways. The uni was of good quality. 5/5

Buffalo Oyster:
Fried oysters tossed in sweet and sour kochujang on a bed of greens. The oysters were tender and not overly fried. The sauce that coated them was a bit spicy and tangy, and quite interesting. 3/5

Salmon Poke Tacos:
Chunks of salmon with mango jalapeno, red onion, red tobiko and sesame seeds. This was refreshing. They sell poke taco platters! 4/5

Warm Springs Roll:
Spicy soft-shell crab, cucumber, avocado, and eel sauce. The soft-shell crab was chopped up and I didn't like that too much. 3/5

XXX Roll:
Soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, shrimp tempura, rice paper, avocado, eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy yum sauce. No rice. The rice paper made it a bit difficult to get from the plate - each piece was sticking to the next piece or the plate. But was it good? Why, yes! It was a bit sweet and a lot spicy. 4/5

Cherry Blossom:
Crab meat wrapped with salmon, no rice. I love non-rice options since I don't enjoy rice at all. 4.5/5

Monaka Ice Cream:
Green tea ice cream with a layer of red bean paste inside a wafer. A dessert that isn't too sweet. Easy to eat and isn't messy. 4/5

My cup of hot water for my green tea was never empty. This place is bright and just delightful!"}
{"text":"Been back twice and each time consistently good!  Service, food, value too. The owner always remembers what I like and asks me when I'm ready for my favorite roll!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with partial expectations of it being awesome. Something about it made me hesitant. I guess I was right. The food was just okay. The sushi rolls looked like a bad copy of almost any other Vegas style sushi spot. The taste of the salmon and Ahi were fine after me soaking them in my Shoyu/Wasabi mixture (you got to combine the right ratio!) The cashier girl was very pleasant though! Not a fan of this place and I'll be looking for a better option."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Decor - It's definitely a small hole in the wall place. However bright colors and decor make it feel modern.
       - Taste - The food is good and fresh for the most part. Other than the pork belly, I would get everything again.
       - Value - The prices are a bit high compared to their portions. It's like a French place - small portions, but good.
**Ordered**
       - $4.50 Uni in a Spoon - Uni with lemon juice & sea salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA#Ro-d2BTAZduAt50YdlH9LA).
       - $9.50 Tuna Poke Tacos - Spicy tuna cubes in a crispy taco shell. Pretty delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw#PCF4iArhFXVXWRDl7c71nw).
       - $9.50 Seared Beef Salad Bowl - The seared beef came out a little more rare than I expected, but it was still good. The sauce is like a ponzu sauce, but spicier (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA#0LztZ6afnpjte2aOscFDDA).
       - $9.50 Sex on the Beach Roll - Assorted fish with ponzu sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=Z3Q7R_XvBx4Bg94dpOhcPg#Z3Q7R_XvBx4Bg94dpOhcPg).
       - $5.50 BBQ Pork Belly - Expected a bit more seared. It didn't look too appetizing, but it wasn't terrible (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw#LPuuDavpDeZE4IEKZGPPpw).
       - $3.50 Monaka - Green tea ice cream surrounded by a waffer cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish-n-bowl-las-vegas-2?select=BYVMe5mASDtYj86a9kPe2g).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place. It'd say it's Japanese tapas with their portion size."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right by my house and they make my favorite poke bowl. The things that I love about this place are quite simple; quality food, service, and people. I take my big brother here and they always recognize us, which always makes us happy. This place is awesome! 
Things I recommend to try:
FnB poke bowl
Spicy tuna bowl
All of the spicy rolls
Crab cake
So much more haha"}
{"text":"I was on this side of town and saw the yelp reviews were promising, so I stopped in to try it out. My 2 girls loved it. The service was outstanding. There were a few other patrons in the place but the food came quickly. The sushi was so fresh even my 11 year old commented on it. We had several rolls as well as uni and tacos. Every dish was amazing :) my kids have already asked to go back."}
{"text":"I love coming back here over and over. Service is always amazing, always friendly. The food is always on point and fresh. I'll always have this as my go to sushi place."}
{"text":"I showed up during business hours, spending my entire lunch break driving to find they were closed. with a hand written paper saying that they are closed today. Not very cool. I guess i'm going hungry today...."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My favorite restaurant by my house, possibly in Vegas. Owners are amazingly nice, they always remember my special roll and it's always just nice to go in. It's really nice having some traditional Japanese food along with some fun, new style food at the same restaurant. I love it."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times already and the food never disappointed. Came back during lunch for the lunch special, and ordered a gyoza and bbq pork belly for appetizers, and a poke mini rice bowl and bulgogi & spicy tuna roll bento box, both off of the lunch special menu. Miso soup comes with the lunch special items, and it was very flavorful and fresh. The gyoza came out relatively quickly..not sure how freshly made it was. It tasted just fine, but really nothing too special about it. The bbq pork belly, on the other hand, tasted great. The meat was very tender and juicy, and the flavor of the sauce was strong but delicious. I would definitely recommend it as an appetizer. The bento box wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The bulgogi wasn't bad, and the cucumber salad was very refreshing. The poke rice bowl was okay as well. The taste was good, especially with bits of mango mixed in with the poke and fish eggs. But once again, nothing too out of the ordinary. The previous times I've been I've had better experiences with the dishes I ordered, so it probably just depends on which items you get because certain ones are better than others. I would still come back and try new dishes, but it's not my go-to place for japanese/asian fusion."}
{"text":"I had the yellowtail poke tacos, hands down the best poke tacos I have ever tried. The dressing was light and fresh and did not overpower the fish. The taco itself was pleasingly crispy and light. I had my meal take-out and needless to say, I devoured them before leaving my parking spot. I also got the FNB rice bowl and at first glance it didn't look like anything spectacular but wow, again clean and simple flavors do the speaking. The miso soup was even spot on. I was very surprised by the quality and \"wow factor\"'of such simple looking food. I can't wait to go back and try more food!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had since moving to vegas! The customer service is always great as well. The paradise roll is definitely a must try if you like coconut!"}
{"text":"Yum! Roe Festival Salad is super delicious if your a roe fan like me. The Salmon Oh Cha Zuke was excellent too. The miso soup was great too . Fresh, delicious and super healthy! Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This is place has cool vibe and good food! It's the second time I've eaten here and both times the food was really fresh, tasty, and visually appealing. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Great service, probably because I was the the only one there lol. I got their signature FNB poke bowl and it had a lot of yummy stuff I've never had before in a traditional poke bowl. I came during my lunch break around 1:30-2pm and food came out quick. Great, cheap lunch specials. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat. So close to home and food is always awesome, this place never fails to satisfy my hungry tummy^_^ ... Located right next door to Sonic Drive-thru & Suzuya Pastry/crepes. They're a little bit pricey, but hey, they're a small restaurant, the food is awesome, so what? ^_^ I don't mind. 

Here are a few recommendations/favs:
Warm Springs Roll
Love Roll
Touchdown Roll
Lolli Rice
F&B House Salad
Oyster in a Spoon (Bf loves this, I don't eat it tho)
BBQ Pork Belly

They also have a nice selection of desserts like Tempura, Mochi ice cream (strawberry/vanilla/green tea), Macha Affagato, and a bunch of other desserts that I haven't yet tried since I'm always too full from sushi rolls...."}
{"text":"This place is amazinggggg. I've had the FNB bowl, spicy tuna bowl, matcha affogato. I've been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. The chef is great and super nice. He's the one I always see when I go there. The spicy tuna bowl has just spicy tuna and rice. But the flavor of the tuna is fresh and very yummy. The FNB bowl is my favorite. It has tuna and salmon. They never have a \"fishy\" taste. The bowl also has small pieces of chopped jalapeños, mangos (this is the only place that I've had mangos in my poke bowl which adds a nice touch of sweetness to the bowl), masago egg, and poke sauce. The green tea affogato was a nice dessert. The presentation was cool. It comes in a glass up with ice cream and then the green tea affogato is poured over."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem... quiet but don't let it fool you! Fish is very fresh! We love the bowls keep it nice and healthy!!!!! Definitely walk in and try it you won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"It's not the best review right now since I've only been here once but I have high hopes for this place! 

I got the salmon poke tacos. The description included mango jalapeño so I couldn't go wrong with that. And I was correct. You won't taste the spice at all but it's definitely sweet with a hint of mango. Yum. $9.50

I didn't want to spend too much since I can't typically eat a lot of food in one sitting so I only got a spicy tuna roll $4.50 as my second item. Pretty typical. I mean, it's kind of hard to get that wrong. Not that that roll is ever anything special. I'm just a huge fan of spicy than itself. 

Prices might be a little on the high end so watch what you order. Before you know it, the bill will rack up."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such great reviews. I thought their rolls lacked lots of flavor and the fish was not fresh at all."}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend to attend a wedding. We've had enough of buffets and pastas, so it's time to go Asian. 

Found the Fish N Bowl on yelp and gave it a try. To keep this review simple, the food, service, taste, variety, and prices are worth the 5 stars. 

Service was top notch. Very polite and friendly staff. Glasses consistently refilled. Dishes came out in a timely manner. They were also willing to accommodate our orders. 

From Poke to Udon, sushi, sashimi, and bacon tempura, Fish N Bowl has something unique and delicious you must try. 

This place is not a big restaurant, but a nice quaint little cafe."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The food was amazing and decently priced. Portions were all very nice and the quality of the fish was top notch. Super fresh!! Everything looked so good so we ordered a bunch of dishes. Not one bad dish!! The Hamachi Kama was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Saturday around noon - the place was almost empty. It is small; they have about 6 tables.

There is no AYCE but the prices are very reasonable.

My husband order one of the lunch specials for 9.50 - chicken, philly roll, cucumber salad, and miso soup - no complaints!

Then we shared a Seaweed Salad (it had a funny flavor) and a few no rice rolls (all were $10.50 I believe)
Warm Springs roll - yummy!
Rock and roll - good but not the best I have had. it seemed small
Cherry Blossom - lots of crab!

The waitress was very attentive and re-filled our waters regularly.

They do have a happy hour from 4 - 6pm, 30% off regular rolls."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Howard you out did your self. We will be back. Service was on point; very attentive and wonderful recommendations. Couldn't have asked for better. Food was the best I've had. Sushi was fresh and innovative. Delicious !!! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall sushi place is very interesting. The food is a little over priced, but very good. 

We tried the yellow tail taco which was very good but was 3 small pieces. 

We also tried the kalbi bowl which came in a huge bowl, but the plus was that they took the bones completely off. 

The atmosphere was great and I loved how there was only one chef and one waitress because they were super friendly and attentive."}
