{"text":"The food is very good--high-quality, healthy, fresh, and tasty. The portions are a bit small and the prices are a bit high, but it's a great, modern place in this part of town. People can bring their dogs and eat on the \"lawn\"/ patio. Nice, relaxed place!"}
{"text":"We have wanted this place to shine... We wanted it to be our \"neighborhood eatery\".
Modern grove we have given you too many tries. I don't know why we keep coming back? Not only is the food disappointing but you can't get so much a table setting unless you ask. What a continual letdown."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. I've been there twice now for dinner. The first time we had to wait for chairs to be found for an available table outside. I wanted that table because it was the furthest from the speakers. The music is LOUD! The second time we sat inside and we had to lean so far forward to hear each other. 

Service there leaves something to be desired. When we first entered the restaurant  there were 3 young ladies at the hostess stand, 2 with their backs to us. No one looked as we arrived or greeted us. I had to get their attention to be seated.

 Both times we had to wait for silverware and flag down our waitress for our check and once because our order was wrong. No one came by to ask how we were doing. I watched as someone at two other tables got up to find out where their food was. It looked like our waitress had tables all over the place both inside and out. The only person smiling was a very confused bartender unsure how to make a drink, but was laughing about it. 

We ordered salads and it took over 20 minutes to get our food. We asked for a mixed French fry order to go and did not get it. AGAIN we had to flag down a waitress. She brought us the wrong french fries. And when we brought that to her attention not a word was said.  She just picked up the bag and walked away. About 10 minutes later she came back with the other type of fries thrown into the bag on top of the other ones and they were burnt. 
We brought this to the attention of the manager since I am a business owner and would like to know when something wasn't right. He also did not say a word.

The food otherwise was ok. Not worth the other inconveniences."}
{"text":"So just now I went to your and ordered some food to go. I was at firehouse subs for my wife and decided to try you guys. Cool place looks nice.  The lady behind the counter was nice to me but shouldn't be in food service. As I was waiting for my vege wrap and sweet potato fries I noticed she went into the lobby and started cleaning up tables which is awesome ,but I saw her throw away napkins with her hands and handle the broom and dust pan.  I didn't see her wash her hands when she was done. She went to the hot table to put my food in a bag. Gross. She took my sweet potato fries which was a huge portion but they were soggy that were shoved in a small bag. A couple of the fries dropped on the counter and I noticed her picking up the fries and eating them. Ok well I thought the food better be good when I get home because it took forever and I was the only one waiting for food. Another  employee had no problem marching out with her pizza and was talking to another cook. You barely had any customers like 2 or 3 who were already eating.  So I got home the the wrap might have well been soup in a tortilla with soggy sweet potato fries. The flavor tasted like watered down black bean dip with a bunch of soggy greens. I also found a hard green stem from one of the greens that has as hard as a stick. You have no quality control over there. Im sure your easy things like pizza are fine because it's hard to screw it up. Empoyees feel comfortable to help themselves in front of customers patiently waiting for their food. I feel like if I owned the place I'd want to know what's going on. You can be the nicest person on the planet but that does't mean you should be in the food biz! So disappointing and grossed out . Based on your instagram I'd think your a great place. Nothing like your pics."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland. Store bought chips for the dips. Kids Mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless. Chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned. Heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza. Salt is great resource. Thanks but no thanks not again"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new for lunch, cool concept but food just doesn't cut it!  First of all, not organic, sandwiches very dry.  If you want a sandwich just go next door to Firehouse!  If you want a great burger go to Smashburger and if you want great pizza- Grimaldis.  Don't waste your money here. Staff is not trained on food or menu, please train the staff!  And pictures would be helpful for a new restaurant that no one has heard of...  2 stars for atmosphere and cleanliness"}
{"text":"Have been to this place twice since it opened a week or so ago.  Very delcious food.  Love the Mac and cheese bits with their bacon aioli dipping sauce.  So good the dipping sauce should be offered with the fries automatically.  Only thing I could say that they need to work on is their table running.  They have an indoor outdoor area and it seems as though they have no system on what numbers they hand out during the brunch/lunch hours.  Servers walk around looking for numbers as the food cools.  Definitely worth a try, but they still have a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"April 26 was a rainy Saturday morning. Our daughter was in town, so 3 hungry adults headed out to have a nice breakfast. We arrived at 10:58 am, and after my husband parked the car we were at the register at 11:01 am. The restaurant was half empty.  We began to order and the cashier informed us the breakfast stopped at 11:00 am. I asked if we couldn't please still order. No, breakfast was served until 11:00!!! We said we'd go some place else.....no response!!!!! (Very bad sign!). We went to CHOMPIES, where we were greeted by Lovey Borenstein, the owner, and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast!   AND Chompies has been in business for 35 years!

Perhaps Modern Grove should get a clue!"}
{"text":"You guys have gotten to learn time management. Either hire more cooks or replace the one you have that has better time management skills. Waiting 20 minutes for an apple and roasted vegetables is absolutely unacceptable. Terrible first impression. I asked for my money back because no one who does not honor your time and money is worthy to receive it."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on the dog-friendly patio--everything was great! I had the sausage mex burrito and it was AMAZING! My husband got the breakfast sandwich in a brioche bun, which was also great! Wait wasn't bad at all. Great fast casual spot!"}
{"text":"Cubano Panini sandwich & Red, White & Blue salad are delish! Bakery items yummy & buttery. Kinda weird set up in the shared restroom (be sure you adjust, button & zip BEFORE you leave the stall unless you want an audience!). Great atmosphere too. Will try the yoga on the lawn class when it gets cooler."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner tonight at MG! Krista was our server. She was awesome! Made great suggestions with drinks and food. We came in just a little before an hour of closing time - didn't feel rushed or pushed through our dining experience. Food was really good- the Cubano and sweet potato fries were our favorite. We will definitely head back to try out their flatbreads next time - looked delicious! Thanks for a great Friday night Krista and MG :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place. My friend took me out to lunch here yesterday and upon first look it's a really cute looking spot. I like the open concept and there is and cute outdoor grass area you can bring your dog to. As far as the food goes it was pretty mediocre for the price. We had the hummus starter and two paninis. The hummus was pretty good but both paninis were very dry and not full of flavor. I would probably give this place another try in the future if I was in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I stop by Modern Grove about once a month.  The food is always good and the service is pretty good as well.  The area outside for corn hole is always a favorite for my kids.  The one down side I've seen on numerous occasions is that dog owners let their dogs mess on the artificial turf and the owners fail to clean it up.  

This flows along the lines of \"not our fault, but it's our problem.\"  Management should consider a) putting poo bags on the outside area for owners to clean up their dogs' mess b)prohibit non-service animals from the restaurant c)mandate that owners pick up their dog's feces.  

I still frequent the restaurant and recommend it to friends, but please do something about the pet owners."}
{"text":"Just found this place!  Open air, great sandwiches, good drink prices, and DOG FRIENDLY.   Love it so far"}
{"text":"Very cute inside and food tastes good, but slllloooowwww service. I ordered a beer and it took 25min to get it. Ordered appetizer that took another 25min. Our entire dinner was about a 2 hour experience."}
{"text":"Modern Grove has all the making of a wonderful neighborhood cafe. It's in a great location, has wonderful ambiance, and a fantastic outdoor patio. Unfortunately, it falls short in some critical categories: 1) Food is bland and devoid of character--as if it's from the frozen food section 2) Staff is aloof and unfriendly 3) For their restaurant setup, it takes way too long to be served. (And when they delivered their fried mac n cheese appetizer as an apology, it was more like an insult. If you can't make great mac n' cheese--for the love of god--don't serve it!!

If they added some flavor and inspiration in the food and service, it would make this adorable concept truly stand out!"}
{"text":"Ok. Recap two months later. My wife and I revisited. Service and employee attitudes have greatly improved. We will come back."}
{"text":"No idea why this is rated 3 stars.  Reminds me of an \"Arcadia/Uptown\" place!  Turkey burger was amazing.  Egg sandwich was amazing.  Surprised to the upside."}
{"text":"Our server was Allison.  She was high and possibly drunk.  I really pride myself on tipping well and had to make peace with the fact that this server did not deserve a good tip.  So our entire party left her only a 10% tip (which in retrospect was way too much).  Fast forward 1 week and we discover that she added an additional 4 dollars PER PERSON to each of our individual credit card charges.  I've never had this happen before and am so profoundly disappointed in the management for allowing such an unprofessional and incompetent server represent their establishment.  It's a true shame seeing as how the outdoor ambience is quite enjoyable.  I certainly will not be returning."}
{"text":"Groovy new spot and very nice staff, outside dining and modern design... And good location. 

Enjoyed dinner, mushroom burger was really good including the sweet potato fries and macaroni balls!"}
{"text":"This place is completely unprepared at all times. 45 minutes after placing my to-go order; I finally receive my food. Def NOT worth the wait. Overall; I don't recommend Modern Grove & my advice to them would to be hire better &/or more staff."}
{"text":"So nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood, going here feels like you are somewhere else, not in Phoenix!

The breakfast burrito is great and filling and the counter service in the AM is a good call. I've been here a handful of times this summer, and can't wait for the weather to cool to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Went at about 7pm on a Monday night. Bruce was our bartender and was perfect. Served us the right kind of beer and great recommendations on the food. We tried the pretzel for the appetizer and the veggie panini. Only could give 4 stars because I felt the proportion of the appetizer could have been larger for the cost and our French fries came out almost cold. We split the entree and they already had it on separate plates for us. Way to keep it classy and keep things simple for us. 
I wasn't thrilled reading about a patio bar being kid friendly which why we decided on a later time. I do feel that this place is overall under rated on yelp. The ambience is great, the type of food is exactly what they advertise and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant
Dog friendly
Kid friendly
The food is phenomenal
Even the vegetables are done to perfection
Chef had really made some great addition a to the menu here 6 months ago....
Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I am really hoping this place gets it together soon. It is such an awesome location. However, our service and food was pretty bad. It took over 20 min for a waitress to take our order. (We were there around 5, so it wasn't busy.) My burger was over done and tastes rubbery. My kids food came our cold. It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. I have this place two stars because the manager took care of our bill (we weren't the only ones to complain...) and because the grassy patio is really nice."}
{"text":"Walked up for lunch and the place looked.. Empty. My boyfriend and I were interested in the nice bar with outdoor seating. Wanted a glass of wine. Now we had never been here before so like any other place we walked right up and sat at the bar.. Was not greeted... Ever. So we went inside and noticed it was self service.. Okay. We looked at the menu for a moment when the chick working said \"first time here?\" And we said yes and then she said nothing.. No recommendations or tips on what we just walked into. Don't really understand what \"market\" they have going in inside. We asked if we could get a drink at the bar and the chick said yes and that someone would be over. We sat at the bar and receives our food and ate most of it before anyone came over.. When someone finally asked us if we wanted a drink we were done eating. So no we don't want one now thanks. The food was okay. Definitely not worth $32 for a salad, sandwich and some chips and salsa. Full service menu priced items with literally.. No service at all. Disappointed because the place is cute and I'd love to bring my dogs here. But I most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout if you don't want to eat. The drinks are delicious and the patio is  dog friendly a must in this town. By the food it seriously lacking. We ordered a chicken Panini great chicken but nothing else no cheese no flavor ad the side of pasta was the same no flavor. They need to add salt and pepper maybe some olive oil, \"the basics\". It could be a great place if the chef tasted his food. I hope that they make some changes it could be a great hangout near home. 

Hoping for the best I will only come back for wine, not food. Please fix this and you will be packed all day."}
{"text":"I am giving them 5 stars in advance to show what I believe they can achieve. Why? Because I want this place to succeed! Counter service was fast & friendly today. Chocolate croissant was delicious. I've been here 3 times at different times of day. Night service was noticeably slower than breakfast or lunch. After a chat with server, I found out it's because she didn't want to intrude on our conversation. So at least intentions were good. Kitchen likely needs more experience to cook faster. It's all made to order too. And, more importantly, it's a local business that deserves encouragement. Plus, it serves Pepsi in glass bottle or fountain :)"}
{"text":"I'm totally disappointed, i wanted to like the place, the menu looks good, but I'm not coming back any time soon.

first the lady a the counter was very nice (you order an pay first) I ordered a to go wedge salad, it took over 15 minutes to get it... really? finally i get up and see if somebody know anything about my salad, the lady who took the order saw me and knew right away they had messed up. again she was very nice offering cutlery and stuff but i just needed to leave.

i opened my salad and it looked like it had been sitting outside a few minutes, with a LOT of creamy dressing and a very strong mayo flavor, i like mayo, but not on my wedge salad, who puts mayo on a \"ranch\" dressing??
second, why wont you list your wedge salad under salads, but under starters? it didn't make sense...
the bacon tasted a little burnt, i couldn't even taste the bruschetta tomatoes...

The whole place looks disoriented, a couple looking for a \"waiter\", another person asking for ranch at the counter, people didn't know where to order, etc.
and the place is a little loud, the decor is nice, open modern, but that is it...."}
{"text":"We went there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the service was AWFUL!!  We ordered the Italian salad and a pizza. It took them 50 minutes to get our food out to us!   There were people who ordered after us who were getting their lunch.  The place was not busy.  I finally asked if they had lost our ticket, the server was very rude and just said we had a sudden rush.  What?  There were 4 tables outside with people and at the most 5 inside!  I ordered my dressing on the side and of course it came saturated with it along with wilted lettuce!  The pizza was just ok, nothing spectacular.  If you want a GREAT salad and pizza, drive 5 minutes south to Oregano's.  I was very disappointed because the atmosphere was so modern and great!  So, in a nut shell!  The atmosphere is GREAT, the service is lousy and the food is not even \"ok\". My guess is with all of the places that have great service and excellent food that this place will not be around much longer.  Not even in the same realm as Postino's or LG Orange."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the hummus and my husband loved his beef panini called The Roast. Nice atmosphere but uncomfortable chairs."}
{"text":"The exterior and interior of this place is beautifully modern. Definitely attractive and a place you want to hang out at. The servers are all very nice. Lunch time you come up to the counter to order food. Dinner they serve you. I would actually just be cool with the way they serve at lunch but I don't mind. 
    Good size menu with American food variety. I've been to this place about 6 times. The pizza is very good. The pastries and cookies are also amazing. The cookies are made in house from their own recipe. Hands down some of the best cookies I have ever had. Prices are affordable. I have tried a few appetizers and haven't been too impressed but most things I've tried on the lunch and dinner menu are pretty good. 
   As I understand it this place is very new. Probably still working out some of the kinks. It's definitely a place I would frequent if I lived a little closer. But when I'm in the area I like to go."}
{"text":"Was very excited to go even after the so -so reviews. The service was slow. The food wasn't great vs the cost.  The only good thing was the beer was cold. I don't think I will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Fun little place. Good food and drinks. Sat at the outside bar and the bartender was very nice and prompt. Only negative was the manager than came over and turn on a fan right over our heads and said \"you are going to hate me\". Supposedly it was to keep out flies but there was not a insect to be found the whole time we were there. Needless to say we left immediately after. My husband and I planned to have a lazy Saturday munching and drinking but was cut short. I feel bad for the bartender the could have a much bigger tab if we were able to stay comfortable."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service was EXTREMELY slow.

We arrived about 5:30 PM on a Friday. The place was maybe 25% full, mostly with people at the bar. We were seated immediately,  but then waited at least 15 minutes before our waitress showed up.  During that time the hostess told us 3 different times that our server would be there shortly. Almost an hour after being seated our food finally came.  

While we were there the place filled up and the wait got even worse for others. Three tables around us either left before their food arrived or had to get it to go. 

After all of that the food was pretty bland. 

Cute place, but the food and service don't live up to the curb appeal.   We won't be retuning."}
{"text":"The decor and feel of the restaurant is outstanding.

But the food...it's just not very good.  We got the chicken panini and the bread was very sort of rubbery and the chicken extremely dry.

We did get a kale salad and it was actually pretty decent.  The strawberry salad wasn't all that great though.

The service was very hit and miss, it took me a really long time to get the beer I ordered and it wasn't even busy, I had to hover over the bartender as she never acknowledged that I was standing there. 

If I go again, it'd be for appetizers and drinks and that's probably about it."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Napa pizza is delicious. Hail Kale salad was phenomenal. Glad to have found this restaurant in the neighborhood. Reminds us of the Oakville Grocery that once was at Scottsdale Quarter. Tuesday's deal on gourmet pizza can't be beaten. Only $5.99 all night long on Tuesdays. Wait staff are friendly but service is lacking on attentiveness. Would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza with the caramelized onions and goat cheese, it was very very good! The vibe of the restaurant is very friendly and open which I enjoyed. The service was a tad slow for my liking otherwise good food!"}
{"text":"Fun little location and concept.  However, food so-so, but service terrible.  We experienced service similar to others who stated here that service was bad.  We were told that we had to go in to order food and get service, which is fine, but the bartender then proceeded to service a certain two tables right next to us, to my bewilderment.  We, too, had fun watching them go table to table to try and deliver food to other tables before finally getting to ours.  And yes, watch your bill, as ours was overcharged twice on both occasions.   Will not return."}
{"text":"I have given this place four tries two lunch one dinner one brunch on Sunday and all failed in the food department. The first two times service at outdoor tables was awful. Extremely slow service. Refills were impossible and they were taking away plates before people were finished eating. Pretzels dry, salads wilted and sandwich my friend had was on dry bun and over cooked.  I blamed all this on the fact they had only been open a few weeks. Next two visits I sat deliberately up at the bar so i could eliminate the table service. The bartenders I have encountered are all very sweet and attentive but food quality still was terrible. Hummus had no flavor. I asked for veggies substitute instead of bread and it was like I asked them to make me a Big Mac. The pizza my friend ordered was under done and the crust was still white. I opted to forgo dinner and drank a glass of wine. My last trip was from this past Sunday. I went alone for morning brunch. My quiche (you can see in pic) had a browned top and a raw bottom crust. Eggs were cold and even watery and undercooked in center. What a bummer. This place is literally one min from my house and I would have given them regular business. Giving up until I read consistent good reviews."}
{"text":"Very creative menu with very good healthy options. A very welcome addition to the dismal food offerings in the area. The outdoor patio is great with kids. Try the pretzel sticks, strawberry salad and the steak fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to Modern Grove about 6 times and I have enjoyed the food each time... Except for this last time. I was eating a salad and found a live lady bug crawling around in the salad (after consuming about 80%). I walked right up to the counter and they took the plate then said they would make another salad. I declined the second chance to eat bugs, but should have pushed for my money back. Almost $13 for a salad with a bug...no thank you. 

They did bring me out a baked good, which I did not eat because of the salad experience. Also, because after inspection that was not in any condition to eat. It was very undercooked. 

I cannot give this place one star because I have enjoyed it so many other times. However, I was very disappointed in my service and meal today. I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks really modern and green so despite the 3 stars review I thought I would give it a shoot. This place has a good environment but the food was bad with a limited selection menu. My friend and I ordered a flank steak panini and grill chicken salad. The flank steak was over cooked and it just doesn't taste good. The sweet potato wasn't too bad. The grill chicken in the chicken salad doesn't look like it was grilled and it's cold. Will not recommend it."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful day in the Valley and husband and I are doing errands. We happened upon Modern Grove and decided to give it a try. Support local small businesses!
We were at first impressed with the decor. Earthy yet with clean lines. And a really cool outside fire place. I am a sucker for outside fireplaces.
The menu had a decent variety of fresh dishes. Salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups and desserts made daily. I try valiantly to adhere to a Paleo diet and when we were greeted by a pleasant gentleman named Doug, I asked if I could modify a veggie bowl for my needs. He sat with us and chatted a while about the restaurant, then personally went to the kitchen to ensure my order was correct. We then retired to outside seating area to enjoy this wonderful day.
Soon our orders arrived. We sipped on iced tea while we feasted on a roasted veggie bowl and mushroom burger. Husband says that the burger was exactly as ordered and he praised the mushrooms. My bowl was flavorful and just the right size. We were checked on by Doug during our meal. 
Our server was Emily and she was a ray of sunshine. Definitely management potential.
We will surely return!"}
{"text":"Modern Grove is in a nice location and it's clean and very cute. I wanted to like it so much but the food was just okay and on our first visit our food was lukewarm. It took a very long time to get it, so I assume it was dying in the kitchen window. Server rarely checked back on us, so we couldn't even ask her to warm it. The restaurant was pretty empty so I don't think she was busy. We decided anyone can have an off night so we tried it again. The food was warm this time and pretty good. Unfortunately, the service was so slow. After she took our order, we never saw our server again. No refills, no checking on how the food was, no offer for dessert etc. We sat at a dirty table for ten minutes just waiting for our check. Finally, another server noticed, apologized profusely and brought us boxes and got our server. Our server came back 5 more minutes later telling us how busy she was (um, not really our fault right?) and offered a weak apology. She never did clear the dirty plates either. The other server who had helped us find her, very graciously apologized for her again and gave us some baked goods to take home. I appreciated that she was trying and I wanted to compliment her to her manager. Messaged the business on Yelp to see who was In charge and who I should contact and i received one reply asking what this was regarding. I told her service and she never got back to me. I followed up and asked for the info a week or so later and still no response. Overall, the service is what makes this place a \"never again\" for me. Both times it was incredibly slow and non responsive. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and healthy food for breakfast or lunch.  The best aspect of the restaurant is the indoor/outdoor atmosphere - particularly the dog friend aspect. But there are time when they are a little too family friendly, in the sense that, for some reason, it's a-ok for kids to be running around loudly, sharing their volume with everyone else.
The staff seems to be a little too busy, and we often have to get up to ask for extra napkins, silverware or ketchup. 
But the food is excellent - though do not be even 2 mins late if you want breakfast or brunch - they are annoyingly strict with the 11am cutoff time.  Lunch is excellent, and I highly recommend the turkey burger and zuchhini fries."}
{"text":"When we arrived for lunch today we were surprised to have the cashier flag us over to order at the counter.  We placed our order for a starter and told the cashier we would split an entree.  We were asked which side we would like.  As I was trying to locate our choices on the menu, the cashier rattled them off so fast, all I could understand was fries.  I was embarrassed and simply said yes to fries.  Our server brought all of the food at the same time and when I explained she brought the starter with the entree she asked if we said we told the cashier we wanted the starter first.  Then she asked, \"what do you want me to do?\"  We asked her to take the entree back while we enjoyed our starter.  There was a lot of discussion at the pass as if this was the first entree to ever be returned.  We were so dismayed with our experience that we got up and left before the brought back our entree.  With so many restaurants popping up in the PV Mall area, there are much better ways to spend your money."}
{"text":"Great place! Very nice and friendly. Concept is very unique as you can order your own food until 4 after wards, restaurant changes to a sit down restaurant.

Food was AHHH MAZING! 
we ate very light. Strawberry Salad and pizza. 

I am in mesa and very worth the Drive!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the portions were appropriate for the price. I have a service dog and it can be tricky going out to eat because of this. The staff was nice and fell in love with him. We were able to eat inside without a problem; even though normal dogs can only be on the outside patio. I would go again."}
{"text":"Just moved Down the street from
Here and we were excited to check it out. Nice outdoor patio, portions are small and overpriced. The food lacks seasoning and flavor. Staff is friendly though. Caprese salad was definitely lacking, 4 slices of tomato, 4 slices mozz and 4 leaves of basil for $12. Definitely great for their food  cost....probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast Saturday morning at 7:30. Not so busy. Service was great. Vibe is fresh and modern. The chorizo grain wrap was pretty amazing! My friend had the breakfast sandwich and he liked it."}
{"text":"Such a fun location with delicious food. Love kale hail salad. It's my favorite. My kids love the burgers with seasoned fries. When you have active kids this is the place to go for lunch. They get to play outdoors and enjoy their food at the same time. Prices are a bit too high but good food!"}
{"text":"Great weather finally! So we sat out on the patio and watched a beautiful sunset. The server was friendly, attentive and right there whenever we needed anything. Drinks were on our table in less than 5 minutes. 
   The Dr. Bash quinoa was warm, full of veggies and kinda different but very tasty. The Strawberry Chicken salad was to die for.      However, the Turkey and Cheddar Sandwich was dry, bland and a big disappointment. Looked great but the sesame bread was crusty and dried out. The turkey was tasteless. 
  Playing corn hole right next to our table while we waited for our main course was a delightful addition to our wonderful drinks and yummy salads. Not our first time here, definitely not our last! Just no more Turkey and Cheddar."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place!  It's adorable and in a great location but went for happy hour earlier in the week and I was the only one in the restaurant at 430p and they said there is no happy hour menu and they are revamping the menu........they have revamped it at least 3x!  Decide what your going to be and just do it already!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Local business, neighborhood restaurant.

Absolutely the most relaxing place to enjoy some great food and time with friends.  A \"grassy\" lawn with outdoor seating, a quaint little store front and indoor seating.

Been there several times and every time it just gets better and better.

With the kids in tow, or leaving them at home, every visit is better than the last.  Food, service, atmosphere- it's all excellent."}
{"text":"OMG, this is my new favorite place! It was so nice to get a modern, fun, great food restaurant in the neighborhood. My husband and I love going for lunch and happy hour. The atmosphere is so cute and the $5.99 pizzas on Tuesday is such a fun idea. We continue to bring our friends and come back!

A couple of items we love are the bruschetta boards and the margarita pizza! I definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Update: french fries and hash browns recipes changed. They were better when they first opened. I can't seem to get an answer on the change. Not as good. 

Great place. Great atmosphere. With open indoor and patio dining. Just had their grand opening and the service is getting to match the good good they serve. A must try if you live in the PV/Scottsdale area. Love the San tan hefe!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have wanted to try this local restaurant since it opened but it was always way to packed.  We finally had a kid-free night last night and decided to give it a try.  It was not packed so we were seated right away. It took a few minutes before someone took our drink order but she was able to bring them out in a timely fashion.  I ordered the bruschetta board.  You get to chose between different types to include in the board.  I selected 1) prosciutto, honeydew melon and mascarpone cheese, 2) goat cheese, roasted peppers and balsamic drizzle and 3) gorgonzola cheese, walnuts and apples. It was a beautiful board when it arrived but I had some issues with it.  First, they were extremely difficult to eat.  The honeydew melon was diced into extremely small pieces so they fell everywhere.  The prosciutto was once slice that was rolled on top.  This gave the opposite problem from the honeydew, it was difficult to bite into so you had to sit there trying to rip it with your teeth.  I think a better presentation would have been to slice the honeydew and diced the prosciutto.  The gorgonzola apple one was just odd.  They had this huge pile of crumbled gorgonzola cheese on the bread with one thinly sliced apple slice.  The balance was just way off.  They could have cut down on the cheese by two thirds and added 4 slices of apples to make it better.  We liked the roasted red pepper one so I don't have much to say about it.  

My husband had a hamburger and french fries.  He said it was good but I did not taste it.  The french fries were crispy and great so I give them 2 thumbs up.  The only other thing I can really comment on is that my ice tea was not filled up once the entire time we were there.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine and is inexcusable...especially since they were not that busy!  I will probably give them one more chance but so far I am not that impressed."}
{"text":"So dissapointing. As I walked in the decor was impressive but the dirty tables with dishes left on them weren't appealing especially because there weren't many people inside so they weren't super busy.The service is very poor. I came in to grab a burrito and the cranky waitress made it obvious she didn't want to be there. After placing my order I sat and waited for my burrito and was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen is open so you can see all the action. Cool, right?! Not when you happen to see that your burrito is being made with carton eggs. Gross. When I got my order I was handed the bag with no \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" but I'm not really surprised. Burrito was pretty basic but very greasy and came with a side of fruit which was mostly honeydew and cantelope. I got a sanpellegrino and a burrito for $12. So not worth it. It seems as though someone invested a lot of money into dressing up a mediocre restaurant with lazy staff and food that isn't anything special. Oh well."}
{"text":"The space is nicely decked out and the outside has been built up with grass, games and an outdoor fireplace.  The menu isn't overwhelming and we decided on coffee, the ultimate breakfast sandwich and apple filled croissant.  Let me just rave about this fluffy, sweet, decadent apple filled croissant for a bit.  Each bite I savored and wished for more in my mouth but not around my waist.

The ultimate breakfast sandwich, which was also good, didn't live up to the name.  If you want to call yourself ultimate, you best have some meat on there.  I have never seen an ultimate fighter without a lot of meat on him, I'm talking some bacon, ham, sausage or all three.  We'll be eating the panini next time, it's exactly the same except it has meat and no avocado or tomato.  I'm cool with that.

Coffee was good, they had iced coffee on tap and my husband had three cups."}
{"text":"We stopped in Saturday about 12:30 and ordered at the counter.  Apparently this place is order at the counter by day and traditional restaurant style service at night.

We ordered the hummus, kale salad, and Mac n cheese bites. We got our iced tea, which they have 3 kinds, and waited...

After 35 minutes our food finally comes out, well the Mac bites and hummus. A food runner comes over with a kale salad which we tell her we are waiting on.  She then looks at the menu and takes our salad back to the kitchen and then starts cashiering... We tell another runner we are waiting on a kale salad so she goes into the kitchen and brings that same salad back to us.  Word to the managers- hot pink scrunchie employee is not helping you!!!!

The food itself was actually quite good.  The Mac bites were warm and yummy- the pasta was not overlooked.  The hummus comes with yummy pita chips and olives and feta on top of the hummus.  The kale salad was my favorite with pistachios and mandarin oranges.

If we had gotten our food without the confusion, if rate modern grove 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time here at this neighborhood joint....love the open air decor.....we sat at the bar and it was perfect....Tyler was very hospitable by giving us tasters of beer on tap and informative of the menue....I had the Kale Salad and Grilled Cheese with very tasty Fries......definitely will return to this place:-)"}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff with a ladle back atmosphere. There food was all fresh made no frozen products. This would be a great happy hour location with an inviting outside."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! The blueberry cheesecake cookie was delicious treat. Owner is so friendly and staff is accommodating! Definitely coming back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The staff nice & helpful for the most part. The Hail Kale salad was very very tasty & side potato salad with sweet & red potatoes was tasty too. I would go back again & maybe have some of their beer selection."}
{"text":"Long wait for food. Food arrived cold. Disorganized waitstaff. Nice patio but I can get that at home. Go to Firehouse Subs. It's just down the way..."}
{"text":"This place offers a nice spot to sit and relax in the sun. For a walk-up, it took forever for food to come out. The staff did not seem to know where they needed to be or what they needed to do. If I didn't take care of things for my wife and I no one else was going to. Food was tasty but a bit bland. The vegetables in the panini were grilled nicely and the steak panini definitely was full of steak. I am willing to give it another shot. Probably try for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place is very inviting, I could not wait to try it!   They've been open a little over a week.   Tonight my husband and I checked it out.   The décor, ambiance and feel of the place were great.  However, the positives end there.    We were seated promptly, however it took 50 minutes to get our food.   
There were about 10 people in the kitchen, so we were thinking food would be sent out pretty quickly.  We were wrong.   I ordered the Capri Sandwich (Mozzarella, red peppers and prosciutto) and my husband ordered the steak Panini.
It should not take 50 minutes for these items.
Sandwich:  Bread was STALE!  Very Stale, it was so hard I could hear a noise when I banged the crust on the table.   There needs to be more quality control in the kitchen and this item should NOT have been served to anyone.   The side pasta salad was also hard- you could tell it had been left in open air and was not sealed for storage until use....
Panini: very fatty, not great quality of meat.
It took awhile to get our check.  We could not wait to get out of there.
Management:  Please have a quality control person in your kitchen to inspect everything before it leaves the kitchen and served to customers.  For a new restaurant, there are sure to be some kinks, but the quality of food served, after waiting 50 minutes for it was not acceptable.
Hopefully they straighten up their act, or this place will not be open for long."}
{"text":"We've now been here twice and it's time for my review. Modern Grove is a great neighborhood restaurant. The kind of place you go to grab a drink and hang out with family and or friends. The menu is simple yet expensive enough to cover pretty much anyone's palette. We've had burgers, chicken sandwiches, pizza, apps, cocktails, and beers all were great. I strongly suggest if you are going to visit Modern Grove that you do so around sunset and take advantage of their great outdoor seating area. With the sun setting and the nice outdoor lighting you are sure to unwind and enjoy yourself. We will certainly return in the future and hope to see you there..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Modern Grove. I stumbled upon it since I was new to the area and it doesn't disappoint. The location has a fun patio that's dog friendly and has corn hole/ bags as a fun game to play. The restaurant has a beautiful look to it and all of the food I've had here is good. It seems to always be quiet here.
Definitely recommend the cubanio panini and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"4/26/14-  Bartender Peanut mixed me a special brew. 4/5 Hella Pils and 1/5 Firehouse 

Added after meal:  decided to go to the restroom before I left. NOT COOL!  Unisex sink area- guess I'm just old fashioned that way. I don't want to share a sink area and toilet with men.  I hope this isn't a new trend. 

Maybe they don't have the kinks worked out yet, so I'll give 2 stars for this visit. 
My sandwich - turkey and cheddar panini - was delicious. My fries were cold. Hubby's Cuban panini seemed to be assembled by a child- Cuban is turkey, ham and pickles- all the turkey was on one side of the bread, all the ham was on the other side and the pickle was only in the middle - so it was more like 3 sandwiches rather than the delicious combo of flavors that a Cuban should be. 
Let me just say that I never really understood the concept of placing your own order, picking a seat then having a \"server\" bring you the food. While waiting much too long for a panini, I saw the food delivery folks wandering all around almost dropping food looking for the right table. Also, you have to get your own drinks and condiments including salt and pepper. But you can bet there was a line for a tip in the credit card slip!  Since I did most of the work, it puts me in a pickle when it comes to tip amount. 
Outside seating and bar are really cool though and the music didn't suck. I'll be back to see if things improve."}
{"text":"What a great place! Food is fresh and delicious. The wait staff is super friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere to bring the kids. We love the open air concept and will be coming back often. The cookies are awesome. So glad this is in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's a interesting restaurant that seems to have an identity crisis. Its very bright, it's set up like a deli on one side a bar on the other side, picnic tables and games outside with a cafeteria feel. You are met by a hostess to be seated but it doesn't seem like that's necessary.  They have self serve drinks so you just walk to drink counter and get it yourself, no need to wait to be served but our waitress took our cups and filled them for us. I would have liked her to refill them at my table instead of taking our glasses. I had a chicken sandwich which tasted like it was cooked a few days earlier, my husband had a mushroom burger which was bland.  It seems like a fun place so we will bring the kids next time and sit outside at the picnic tables. Well try it one more time."}
{"text":"First time. I may come again to try something else. I got a pizza and while it was very good the crust tasted like it needed salt. It had a fig spread, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and topped with ham. The fig spread was delicious and my husband kept stealing my pizza. His pizza was extremely bland. There wasn't any sauce and it basically was arugula and ham on a bland crust. My kids got cheese pizza which was good. The atmosphere is fun and the service decent. So I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Ok,  I hate to pile on to this place.  It has SOOO MUCH potential and the whole area wants them to succeed!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside and out and the concept seems like it would be a lot of fun but.... It's not.  

The service is slow and seems confused.  They food is well.. just blah.  I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  

Ok so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with \"True Food\" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.) Finally, if you want it to be a neighborhood hang give us a GREAT Happy Hour! Good drink and appetizer specials and a cheap kick-butt Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's on the weekends.  I really hope you guys get it together because you could be a lot of fun!

Oh and fix your water in the bathroom hot is always on the left!"}
{"text":"Ew. The food was gross- we had the steak fries, turkey burger, salmon bowl and two kids meals. I decided to come here bc it there were many reviews that it was Super kid friendly. (We had 3 toddlers) - if kid friendly meant a set of bags on the patio, I guess that's what we got! The wait for
Our food was over an hour, cold and overall disappointing. The steak was so tough I couldn't even chew it. 

I never give one stars and maybe I had my hopes up, but will not go back."}
{"text":"The second time we went and it was on Mother's Day. Made a reservation & the table was set up and ready when we arrived. There was a special brunch menu, which had some nice selections. The restaurant was not super busy and it appeared there was no time be staffed behind the bar. 

Waitress took our drink order & the non-alcoholic items arrived promptly. I looked over at the bar & it was clear that our waitress was making our drinks by reading instructions & it took quit a long time. 

It also seemed to take above average time to get our meals, which were just ok. Nothing fantastic about the special brunch food. Pancakes were average at best, a bit over done. 

No one received a refill of water or ice tea throughout our entire meal, not good!

Overall, it was ok. Our first experience was a bit better. It is a cute restaurant with great outdoor seating & lots of potential!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to like this place. The concept is fabulous and if it had been executed properly, we would be back every weekend. Unfortunately, there is one issue Modern Grove can't seem to work out (and as such, appears to be a common theme in these Yelp reviews)... Service. 

Our server was personable, she tried to make conversation and told us a little about herself (she works in the kitchen most days, but sometimes works as a server). She was nice. 

We ordered the pretzels. They were good. I would get these again. We had to ask for our waters to be refilled. Then, we ordered the kale salad, cheese on the side, and the tabbouleh quinoa bowl. ... What came out was a seasonal roasted vegetable quinoa bowl and a kale salad with lots of cheese mixed in. 

My husband didn't send his salad back, he just picked around the cheese. I told our server that I had the wrong bowl and she acknowledged it and brought out the correct bowl. She didn't notice the cheese in the salad or ask about it. The manager came out and apologized. I'm not sure if our server entered the order wrong or if the kitchen made the wrong order. Doesn't matter. These dishes were average. 

We may give it a second try. Maybe they will do some training for servers."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, have ordered both appetizers and food, and all of it was awful! So bland, and a waste of money! Which is disappointing because our server was so sweet. This place looks a lot better than it is and the main problem seems to be the kitchen! Get a better chef please!"}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this awesome place! Great menu, service, and atmosphere!! We'll definitely be back asap with our dogs too!!"}
{"text":"First, be aware that this place is self-service. Go to the counter, order your food, take a number for table side delivery. So your expected to tip when you order. Which means you have no idea what service you'll get, but beware of leaving a poor tip because they haven't made your food yet... The atmosphere was obnoxious with kids running freely around and the food was barely mediocre. I can honestly say I've made a better chicken panini at home.

Location: 5 - great local neighborhood location. 
Setup: 4 - cute decor, nice bar, large patio
Service: 3 - staff were polite but short and hurried. Little attention to detail, such as making sure everyone had silverware
Atmosphere: 2 - unsupervised kids running wild, screaming, yelling, laying on the ground
Food: 2 - extremely average. Pretty sure the chicken was precut precooked strips and the fries were cold."}
{"text":"After hearing from the staff, I gave Modern Grove another try, and was very pleased with the meal/service."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but falls flat. I ordered a chicken panini and had one bite. The chicken was dry and the panini bread was horrible. The only thing I ate off my plate was the fruit. I ordered a mimosa and basically got an oj with a splash of champagne. 
The staff seems confused about everything and are all running in a million directions.
Aaaaand the hat stand in the bathroom looks ridiculous."}
{"text":"hail to the kale salad is amazing! Great service, food and atomosphere"}
{"text":"I decided to give it one more try to see if Modern Grove could redeem themselves.  Unfortunately, they did not.  My wife and I waited, and waited, and waited for about 15 minutes.  We thought they should come to our table very soon.  Another group came in, was seated, had their drinks and we were still waiting.  We finally got up to leave and the waiter came over and said hi.  I told him we were leaving as we had been here too long.  He could care less as he just walked off without any apology or explanation.  I would give this place a minus 5 if I could.  I will not waste my money at this place as this time was worst than the last.  I do not remember ever going somewhere to eat and not being served at all.  Worst service of all time."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Sometimes we go there and everything is great. Other times it's awful. There isn't much of an in between. Tonight it was pretty terrible. 40 minutes to get our overcooked cold burgers, had to hunt down our own silverware, and the group next to us screaming for cold beer since all of theirs were served warm."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Modern Grove on Tatum Road on the way to a concert at the Musical Instrument Museum. We were a bit rushed and needed a quick meal, so our server Channing hopped into high gear with a big smile and energy galore. 

She began by bringing us a fine and reasonably priced pinot noir, took our orders and rushed them to the kitchen, and assured us we would not have to rush through our meal.  We didn't.

Ellen ordered a piping hot, delicious bowl of potato, bacon, and cheese soup on an abnormally chilly evening. I ordered a highly satisfying chicken panino on perfectly pressed focaccia. Channing arrived with our meals promptly, and offered to ring up our meals so we would not have to wait when finished. Her service was nothing short of fantastic!

Then came a complete surprise as we finished. Channing brought a large carry-out container filled with a large cinnamon roll, a luscious pecan roll, and three beautiful big cookies that were left over from earlier in the day. 

We placed these items in a zip-lock bag when we got home after the concert. They were still fresh and delicious this morning, making a good part of today's breakfast, along with fruit, juice, and hot tea. So hats off to Modern Grove and Channing for providing the perfect combination of outstanding food and unmatched service on our first trip there. 

We will become repeat customers for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a spot we have been to about 8 times. The secret to this place is know what to expect, when to go and what to order. There are only a few things on the menu you can order and not be totally pissed. If you plan your visit just right it can be ok. If you do not you will leave upset and have a 0 star experience.

Food:

Do order the pretzel and beer. Do order the Cesar salad. Do order the breakfast burrito. Do order the bread pudding. Do order drinks.

Do not order just about anything else. Most of the menu is void of flavor or correct preparation. Do not be tricked into item descriptions like Mac and cheese, pizza, burger etc.. It's a trap.

Service: 

Do not come here if you like quality service and attentive servers. The servers are pretty bad. Most of the time I have to flag down our server to get refills on drinks. They usually do not give a shit about you or your needs.

Atmosphere: 

Great building, Bar and patio. This is the real disappointment because with the right food and service this place could be very good. But even with a great layout you will be disappointed as the laid back pet friendly patio gets over run by kids who's parents use it as a Chuck E Cheese and let their kids run around screaming and yelling while they zone them out. It seems like this place has changed from an adult hang out to a kids playground on the weekend and is the last place you want to chill out with friends for a relaxing meal. This past visit we had a bean bag thrown onto our table and a glass broken next to us by a wonderful group of children who had been running around acting like wildlings all evening. If you are one of those inconsiderate parents who likes to turn your kids loose to annoy the shit out of others while you pretend not to know what they are doing so you can take a break from your unruly children and have a good time with like minded parents you will love it!"}
{"text":"I went to Modern grove and wasn't very impressed. I went with a group, so got to hear comments from others at my table.  Overall, the food was average at best, while prices were certainly above average. I ordered a soda and salad which came to over $13, and the salad was not large by any stretch of the imagination. It could easily be a side salad at other restaurants. 

We'll the soda must be OK right? Nope they were not only out of syrup but the carbination was not working as well, so flat soda for everyone.

Others in my group that got hamburgers or sandwiches did not think they were a good value either, and a noon, the place certainly wasn't busy.  

I will not go back. Certainly there are much better places to get better salads for cheaper. Count my words, this place will be gone in a year if not sooner. I forgive the higher prices if the food was good, but really it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a last minute dinner invite at this little gem!  The atmosphere is casual and relaxing.  Beverage options are excellent and well priced.  Menu items are creative with a wide variety to choose from.  Our server was friendly and gave excellent recommendation for the blueberry cookie desert!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Paid $39 for two turkey burgers, two drinks and one plate of hummus.

Seating is poor--hard as a rock!! Service is very slow."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a few more times, including last night.  The food is still mediocre but last night the service was pretty good.  We usually go on Tuesdays and were used to the place being very crowded.  When we arrived last night the restaurant was just about empty so I knew something had changed.  Sure enough our server told us that their Tuesday pizza special ($5.99 for any pizza) had been discontinued at the end of December.  That is too bad because now they have a very limited happy hour.  At most during our stay there were three occupied tables at most.  All the staff, including the two cooks, were just standing around.  Given what we saw and the mediocre food, I can't imagine them remaining open much longer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill very rapidly.  I can no longer recommend this place.  The last three times we ordered there we were very disappointed. First time we ordered a pizza with light sauce for pickup and got no sauce, mistakes happen.  2nd time we called to order a hamburger for pick up and they had no mushrooms or caramelized onions so we did not order.  Friday night we took our grandson there for pizza and it was a disaster; it was very greasy, the toppings fell off, and some of the crust was under-cooked.  The menu has gone thru some drastic (in my opinion) changes.  No mushrooms, no small size salads, very little options for burgers or pizzas, etc.  This is a shame as we did like going there for burgers, salad, and/or pizza; NO LONGER."}
{"text":"Gave the new place a try last night with my husband and we were not overly impressed. 

Negatives: Like many other reviews, the seating was uncomfortable. My husband's hamburger patty was super thin. You could barely see it under all the lettuce and bun. Mac-n-Cheese balls were bland. 

Positives: The staff was friendly, atmosphere was inviting and our food came out quick considering the place was packed. 

Because this place is new, I'm willing to give it a second chance. I'd like to try the panini or breakfast."}
{"text":"Very average food. No selection of veggies for salad. The chicken had a funky taste from refrigerating after cooking. Not impressed and won't be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place has a really great atmosphere. It's perfect for dinner bc the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Their customer service is amazing and everyone is so nice and friendly. Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"I am writing this review from the restaurant. Why, may you ask am I writing this from the restaurant and not ... Oh... Let's say eating or perhaps drinking? Well we have been sitting here for one hour (not an exaggeration - it's a Thursday. We got here at 7:45. It is now 8:48). Our appetizer has now arrived as well as my daughter's Mac and cheese, my husband's grilled cheese and a random pizza \"on the house\". It's been an hour. 

The appetizer we ordered is the Mac and cheese bites which are not bad. The cheese and bacon sauce is pretty good and really delish if you dip your sandwich.

(Btw, 8:56 and the manager just came over. He apologized profusely and said he was embarrassed and offered to comp our meal. 3 of us still don't have a meal. The manager just came back to ask what we ordered)

My daughter really loves her Mac and cheese which looks pretty delicious.

I ordered the traditional iced tea which is really good and has a strong tea flavor. I like it a lot. I've also had a lot of it. :)

It's 9:03.

My husband is now taking my daughter home to put her to bed. She's 3.

9:08! My food is here! My friend's food is here! My mother-in-law's food is not.

Ok. Now we have our food. MIL has pizza Bianca. She likes it and says that you can really taste the different cheeses. There's arugula on it which gives the pizza bite and adds some delicious flavor. 

Both my friend and I ordered cheeseburgers . They were flavorful, but the kitchen put the whole burger under the broiler and that burned the top of bun and made the bun strangely greasy. I also thought that the patty was a bit thin which made it somewhat dry. Flavorful, but a bit dry.

Now, we also ordered a bread pudding to go when we ordered almost 2 hours ago, but I think we're going to just let it go. 

Food is a 2
Experience is a 0 but it's a cute place so it's a 1
And so it's a 1 and a half, but the manager asked us to come back and try it again and I will give it the benefit of the doubt, so it's a 2."}
{"text":"Service was unacceptably slow from the waiter to the kitchen, and the food, including pizza and burgers came out luke warm. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only gets 3 stars...the atmosphere is really nice. It's open and airy, and the outdoor patio areas look really nice. They even have an outdoor bar area with one of those trendy garage doors. I'll admit I avoided this place for a while because of it only having 3 stars here on yelp, but it was inevitable that I try it since its right down the street from our house. 
To play it safe I ordered the pizza. Half cheese half pepperoni. It was actually good! Kinda greasy, but not a turn off...my Hubby ordered the chicken breast sandwich with crispy chickpea breading and sweet potato fries. The fries are awesome! The sandwich looked really good and fresh, just not my thing. He said he enjoyed it a lot! All in all, this place is pretty cool for a neighborhood restaurant and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Blech.  I was really hoping to enjoy this place since Its so close to home.  The interior is very clean and fresh looking and the employees seemed nice enough.  The food however was abysmal.

I got a chicken caesar salad and a cubano panini.  Whatever chicken they used in the caesar sincerely made me sick to my stomach.  It was borderline rancid.  I would have preferred one of those ready kit salads you can buy at a grocery store.   The cubano panini was basically just mustard with slivers of meat on panini bread.  That's all it tasted like, mustard bread.  

If it weren't for the rancid chicken in the salad I would chalk it off to maybe a poor choice in sandwich and forgo the salad if I were to give it another shot.  Its highly unlikely though."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, decor and staff but the food sucks. I've been here a couple of times because my mom loves this place.. But i don't see the appeal for food. However, I only have had items off of their gluten free menu."}
{"text":"MANAGEMENT: you will go out of business if you don't change it up. Service is horrible. Food is good. First off, like most of the reviews on here I found to have the same experience. I want this place to do well because it is so close to my house. The first time I went there I sat at the bar. I received amazing service & the food was great. It was late & they were not busy. No complaints. The 2nd time I go, a totally different experience. I WAITED 45 MIN till a waiter came up to us. The only reason they finally served us is because we went inside & told them. After I finally get service & order my drink the waiter comes back about 10 min later saying that they didn't have what I wanted. 
I was not the only table on the patio, I saw 4 other tables trying to track down their server as well. When we finally got our food the manager brought it out, drug his feet (literally) to the table. Not professional & trashy how he presented himself. I had to ASK for a discount because it took OVER AN HOUR to eat; and even then they were reluctant to give it to me. 

I want this place to do well but there are too many places with great service that deserve my money."}
{"text":"These folks are trying and you can tell from the reviews that the service ( at dinner) is close to abysmal. 'We are only there during the daytime when you order at the counter.
MG is a work in process and hopefully they will not alienate the customer base to the point that they become a crash and burn casualty.
Their Managers seem very open to feedback and our biggest concern are the flies. These are flies sitting on their baked goods all morning (at the counter) and surely linger on food back in the kitchen.
MG needs to figure out how to manage their open air set up while addressing the flies which should be less as the weather cools.
Again, these folks mean well, yet a restaurant cannot have 90% of its reviews be sooo negative either."}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are talking about... So far the past two times I have eaten here, it's been great! The employees here are always so kind. I received my food in a timely fashion, less then 15 minutes, and it tasted spectacular! I've had the Shrooms Burger and Margarita Pizza so far and highly recommend it. I also love ordering their tropical green tea. Thank you Modern Grove, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been fund raising for a 501c charity. When i spoke with the manager she told me she was meeting on Wednesday w the person who could approve a $20 gift card. She had me go home and get 501c paperwork which I did that same day. I left my number as she said she'd call but never did. I went up today and she said it would be weeks for approval. What a waste of time. This charity helps kids in Phoenix....a simple NO would've saved me lots of time. THANKS TO STREETS OF NEW YORK AND CRUST AND ZINC BISTRO...ALL NEARBY RESTAURANTS WITH GREAT FOOD."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for lunch. Amazing food, amazing service every time. The atmosphere is very modern and relaxing. The food is healthy and high quality. It's even a great place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"We have tried a couple of times.  Almost no accommodations or choices for those with serious allergies (gluten).  Says \"vegetarian\" but not really - has one or 2 of the same old options (veg sandwich / salad).  Good concept but we can't go.  Only one of us can eat there and everything is just \"OK\".  Will hope they expand and become a bit more creative."}
{"text":"This was my second trip in and I was hoping for better.  I had the cubano panini and could barely eat it.  First off when it arrived it looked sloppy...you know the bread didn't line up ..like it was thrown together.  It was heavy on the mustard and pickles.  So much that I couldn't taste anything else.  I don't think the bread was very fresh either.  It just didn't have that grilled, spongey panini goodness.  I should have skipped the sweet potato fries.  They were soggy and limp.  My husband had the regular fries and they were much better.  But his turkey and cheddar panini also left him disappointed.  The atmosphere for dinner was very noisy.  We were stuffed onto a bench next to a couple having words.  But it was just too noisy for them to argue effectively.  I think Modern Grove has potential but they need to start watching what comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Well when we walked in it was empty and was barely greeted by any employees. Finally we just sat at a table and the server came up and took our drink orders and apps. The food I would say is good but not amazing but it seems to be more of a relax and chill place more like a bar then a restuarant.  A definite plus is the green grass outside for dogs I love that you can bring your dog and they have water and treats , more phoenix restaurants need to allow that. But anyways food 3 1/2 stars , and environment 4 but only really cuz of the dogs allowed"}
{"text":"This is a cute new place that I have been wanting to try. They have a shop with the restaurant where you can buy cute items. Seems trendy and has a new hipster design to it. They food was pretty good and my husband really like the flavor of their burger and chicken sandwich. They have corn hole so you can play and a good outside eating area. The staff was also nice which is a must in any business."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But, wow.....my food was so disappointing. I had the vegan quinoa dish. It was undercooked and bland. I'm pretty sure it was missing several ingredients and they should be embarrassed about how tiny the portion was for $10. It's waaaaay too expensive for what you get and service was very, very slow. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...Flower Child is a great alternative...it is also expensive but the food is so tasty, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wanted a good place to eat and decided to give this place a try. Glad we did ..this place is so yummy. Comfortable atmosphere and great service"}
{"text":"This restaurant made a big impression when it first went in. Having tried it a few times now, the takeaway is as follows: great concept, great ambiance, great service, limited menu, average food. The result is about 3.5 stars in my book, rounded up to 4 because Yelp doesn't allow .5's and also because this is exactly the type of innovative restaurant that should be encouraged around here, rather than repetitious chains and cookie-cutter restaurant concepts. Having said that, I don't often eat at this restaurant because I feel like it caters to a more... dilettante market segment. Which is to say that a decent wine / beer bar with a decent outdoor / indoor seating area only goes so far, and only for so long. When it is the only such place for miles around, that certainly helps its cause. What would really go a long way, however, is some delicious staple dishes. As it stands right now, there are about 4 or 5 choices of everything, with most items being wheat-based and with none being especially outstanding. For example, I had the tacos most recently and they were average at best. A few more breakfast options (such as omelets), a few more salad options, and a few more addictive late-night options would make me a regular for sure. Speaking of late night, what's up with the early closing times? A place like this should be open later than your \"garden\" variety family restaurant (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
Annie the hostess treated us like we were royalty. 
The beers were cold.
The atmosphere was hot!
A bunch of pretty people. 
Kinda \"hoity toity\"!
I loved it!
Look for Annie when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Wow!  Took out of town visitors to lunch here. Walked inside and place was empty.   Outside was full due to it being a nice day. It was clear to see that they did not have enough staff.   When someone finally gave us menus, she informed us it would be 35 minutes before our food would be served. We left. It is not an extensive menu so we couldn't justify the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the flank steak panini sandwich which comes with fries and a small drink. There were only 3 couples eating and no one in line ahead of me. It took too long to get the food. I was especially looking forward to this sandwich as I rarely fix flank steak and the menu says the meat is medium rare which it must be or the meat will be too tough. The meat came well done, smothered in cheese with a way too crispy roll. The meat was skimpy for a $10.00 sandwich and I truly could not taste the meat. Fortunately I asked for the horseradish dressing on the side or I would have tasted nothing but the horseradish. Some seasoning would help give an otherwise flavorless sandwich some taste. The charge for a small drink is $2, way out of line in price. The regular fries tasted great but were much too salty for me. The metal chairs were not too comfy."}
{"text":"this place should have tested some things out before opening...

like the food, the service, the food, the service... (what else is there?)

sat down and immediately heard several managers apologizing to many tables about how late the food was coming out. the table next to us was one of those tables. they then got their food, lady took a bite and gentleman cut open his burger and they both literally got up and left! YIKES! we already ordered, so we were stuck now...

food arrives about 25-35 minutes later. pizza comes out first which was interesting because the other items were two salads and a sandwich (nothing to cook). pizza was bright orange because of how much grease was sitting on top :( about 5 minutes later two salads came out... not our salads...so back to the kitchen they go. my husbands sandwich came out with fries when he ordered fruit. the menu isnt that complex, what is the deal? his sandwich was so dry he had to chug water between bites (chicken salad sandwich) the edges of the bread were rock solid/inedible. fruit salad i think was left over from breakfast because the dish was filled with juice and fruit was mush. as for the salads, they finally came out correct...but i think the lettuce was mix from when they opened. my husband works in the produce industry, and i couldn't even fork my spring mix because it was so mushy and flat. i ordered the chicken strawberry salad and the chicken was waaaay overcooked, couldnt even cut it with a fork to break it up. had to saw into it with a knife (these are 3 little nugget pieces anyway). 

went to leave, had to walk to the counter to get my check because the 17 people standing in the kitchen/front area couldn't seem to get it together. what could go wrong now? of well i was billed for the salad that i got incorrectly...they showed me the check for my bill and then charged me an extra $8...so 15 minutes later they got it fixed (still crossing my fingers that i dont get charged first) and then offered me a buy one get one free lunch... thanks but no thanks. i'll be driving right past this place or even going next door to firehouse. 

the structure is beautiful but service and food are kind of a bigger deal...!"}
{"text":"let a tip. check it out. this is my first time using Yelp and thought I was writing a review."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience ever. We waited over 10 mins to even get a menu! We waited an additional 15 mins to get a drink order in. We decided to order all the food, with appetizer, at the time we ordered drinks to try and save time. It didn't work! We waited another 15 mins, still no drinks, no appetizer, nothing. We waited another 10 mins and just finally walked out! There over 45 mins without even a drink. Absolutely the worst experience I have had. Terrible management, terrible service. After reading these reviews, we are happy we didn't have to try to food. Will not be back, don't see how it will stay in business. I give 0 stars on this place."}
{"text":"Food was very good, great atmosphere and clean! However their online menu is misleading! They have wine priced for about $3-4 a glass and then in the place they are charging near $6! I asked a waitress why the difference and it's their flagstaff menu not their Phoenix menu! I was upset I was being charged more than it stated and she didn't even offer the wine at the website price! I hope they have fixed this misprint by now!"}
{"text":"I've only had to-go from Modern Grove, and my experience was pretty good. I ordered the veggie sandwich which had an abundance of grilled vegetables and creamy goat cheese. For my side I decided on pasta salad, the woman who took my order made sure to warn me that there was meat in the pasta salad, since I had ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I think it's great that she was paying close attention to such details, even though I'm a carnivore and meat was no problem. Once I got the sandwich, it turned out to be huge. The photo I have is of it cut in half, but it's actually two layers of sandwich on top of each other. The portion size was very generous. The bread that came on it was foccacia style and a perfect texture. The pasta salad was very good too, it had lot's of flavor. I will definitely return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice food and atmosphere. I appreciate the vibe and staff it was hard finding a modern nice vibe place other than a Starbucks. Being from the bay it's nice to find a eatery and friendly place and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I dined at modern grove for the first time tonight and I had a great experience! We ordered the Mac and cheese bites for an appetizer which were delicious! I ordered the apple chicken sandwich which was very yummy and they had sweet potato fries which I was excited about! They also carry a yummie red sangria I enjoyed with my dinner! I liked the vibe of this place and I definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I cannot get beyond that rate.  Even though their patio is darling, the inside is pretty cool, the food, not so much.  I was meeting a few girlfriends for our monthly book club discussion.  I arrived about 25 minutes early because I was going to order food and I was starving.  This was the only meal I had that day.  I was hoping it would be great.  I asked for a glass of red wine and the grilled cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was not crisp at all, it had grilled marks, but it was more like limp warm bread with melted cheese.  My sweet potato fries were not that great either, most of them looked like the remnants from the batch, mostly dark super thin leftovers.  My girlfriends ordered some salads, they were not impressed either.  Service was good.  The place is nicely decorated, almost too industrial for a market time place.  Our seats were so uncomfortable, they have metal seats and even tough I might be bony overall, I do have some cushion in my trunk, but that didn't help.  We were supposed to be there for about 2.5 hours, but my butt couldn't take it."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after church for lunch. Liked the patio feel of the place. Food was decent Service very spotty and took forever for the food to come. One of us ordered the roast sandwich. When it was over 30 minutes for the order, we asked why the wait, response, had to cook the roast!!  Meanwhile, the second part of the order had been sitting and came out cold.  We asked for a fresh order of fries and were told they could warm them up...we probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a great neighborhood spot! Huge patio and inside/outside bar! The chicken salad sandwich is my favorite but I often visit for a quick cup of coffee and pastry on my way to work! Staff is always friendly and the place is always clean. My friends all live in the neighborhood and frequent often with their kids in strollers, really cute place worth checking out for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and had a great time.  Our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. We started with a bruschetta board that was amazing. For dinner a friend and I split a chicken panini and chopped salad.  The salad was terrific but the sandwich was just ok.  We played a couple of games of cornhole and just had a fun evening."}
{"text":"Just got back from trying this new local place for the first time. I've had better and will not return.

Ordered a burger with potato salad and peach tea. Burger under cooked (the server did not ask how I would like it cooked), if I would have known the potato salad was made with real potatoes ahead of time, I would not have ordered it. I just don't like that kind. Peach tea was so weak it was practically regular tea.

Lastly the server NEVER came back to our table to ask how our food was and certainly didn't ask if we would like refills. Pass on this place........"}
{"text":"I liked the laid back vibe of this place. It's bright and airy with an indoor/outdoor concept. The outdoor area is pet friendly too and there are some games to play while waiting for your food.

We stopped by lunch and it was pretty empty. We were able to pick out seat since there weren't a lot of people there. Our server was friendly and efficient. My husband ordered the special which was the western burger and I got the sweet Cajun chicken sandwich. It seemed to take longer than expected to get our food for the amount of people there and when it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The flavor of my sandwich was fantastic but the chicken was like rubber. My sandwich had spinach, fig jam, apples and cream cheese with a Cajun spiced chicken breast that was a perfect blend of sweet and savory so it kills me that that the chicken was rubbery. My husband enjoyed his burger which had bacon and a fried onion ring and it was huge so he left full. Both burgers came with their batter dipped fries. They are not my favorite style but they were well seasoned and crispy.

Beware of the bathroom doors. I opened the door and started to walk in as the door was closing on me and got hit with the giant coat hook on the back of the door which left quite the bruise."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant/bar that I wish we had more of around the Kierland area. It's a terrific set-up, with a cool vibe, out-door seating, great indoor/outdoor bar area. 

But they have to clean up their act with regards to service and food prep.  Food comes out cold and/or way late. The staff seems disjointed and poorly managed. No one seems to know what they are supposed to be doing.  The ONLY thing this place needs is better management.  But they better figure it out quickly, because it will be a shame to see it close because it was poorly run."}
{"text":"We had the pastrami and chicken salad sandwiches today.  The chicken salad sandwich is just like that old fashioned delicious one you had as a kid! The iced teas are delicious flavored.  Be ready to pay $10 for anything you order- everything is fresh and made to order. No sloppy limp salad or fast food assembly here. 

What I found really profound though flavor wise is the goodies.  She comes in early and makes up batches of whatever it is for the day and when they're out, they're out... So don't miss it.  Today was chocolate croissant w chocolate drizzle... Anyone that's been to noci café it's definitely giving some competition.  Then there's the blueberry chocolate chip... Well... Muffookie... Or cuffin? It's like the perfect balance of a cookie and a muffin.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is in our neighborhood and we hoped that after a year or so it would get better... But at last that seems to be there impossible dream.  Literally a ghost town this am when a buddy and I went in for food I think that the reviews food and service have finally caught up to this what could be a great local neighborhood place.  Hope someone buys it for penny's on the dollar and executes it correctly."}
{"text":"This place barely gets two stars from me. Mostly because it is aesthetically nice. Otherwise it misses the mark. Badly. This is the third time I've come here. I want to like it. But I don't. It's just not good food. You can taste the low quality ingredients they use and the recipes and execution are off. I've left disappointed each time which sucks because this neighborhood needed a place like this. But it needed it to be done well. I was a home run until I tasted the food"}
{"text":"We've been there twice.  The staff is poorly trained and management is horrible!

The first time the waiter yelled at us for going in the wrong door then he decided to put his thumb in my dressing upon bringing it to the table,  I kid you not, he was going to leave it. I actually had to say,  \"do you mind if I get a new dressing\" and he said \"my hands are clean I just washed them\".  I was so grossed out and disappointed we didn't go back for 8 months.  Well we went back last night, I'm all for second chances.

Once again, service was horrible!  Had to continue to ask where our food and drinks were. Watched them, on multiple occasions, try to deliver our food and drinks to other tables.  Once we got everything the food was OK.  When we finally got the bill, they charged me for 2 bottles of wine instead of 2 glasses.  

Will NOT goo back!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews.  This place has great potential with the nice outside patio especially being dog friendly.  The inside is also nice and plenty of seating.  The food I've had has also been very good.   But the service is slow and unpredictable.   If they focus on getting this right then I think they'll have a winner here."}
{"text":"This place is ok for happy hour.  Both of the bartenders were very nice and helpful.  I looked at their happy hour menu online ( I always do some research before I go to a new place) and saw that the prices for wine was $3.99 a glass from 3-6pm.  I even called the location to verify that the online prices were up to date.   I was told that they were and I went to meet a friend after work.  When we got there, the happy hour prices were VERY different.  The prices were $5-$9 a glass.  I asked the bartender about it and he said that their prices have gone up.   Not his fault- but definitely not what I was told over the phone.
So whatever, I ordered a beer and it was good.  My friend ordered the Pinot Grigio and it was pretty terrible.     The malbec  wine she had next was better.  The bruchetta was good.  We mixed 3 different kinds.  We also ordered a margherita pizza which I liked ($5.99 happy hour  $10.99 reg price) but if I had paid $11 bucks, I might not have.   The seats are all metal and after sitting for an hour ,my rump was sore.  Annoying, after a long day at work and all you want to do is relax and be comfortable.  The bathrooms are unisex, which I did not know so I kinda freaked out when I walked into the bathroom and saw a urinal.  I ran back out and double checked that I was in the right place....

I want to give this place 3 stars but I can't justify it.  2 stars for employees being super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Scramble eggs were over cooked. They messed up my husband's order. No sleeves for hot coffee? Mediocre place for breakfast. Good if you want in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Went there last week not expecting much as my husband's been there twice and was very disappointed in the quality of the food. The ambience is very modern and cute but I agree with him the food was not good. I had the grilled chicken panini with sweet potato fries. The chicken was terribly dry, there was hardly any sauce and lots of red onions. I could only eat a quarter of it. The sweet potato fries were ok. My friend ordered the steak sandwich which she also said was terrible. I don't plan on coming back here again. Service was pretty good but the food was just abysmal."}
{"text":"The place is really cute and has a really nice outdoor area to include a bar. Went for lunch and sat outside on the artificial turf.  The lights strung up outside I'm sure will provide great atmosphere at night. The food was good, but noting spectacular. I had a garden salad and the other people in my group had a chicken panini sandwich in which the chicken was dry and a strawberry salad where the strawberries were mushy. I could look past all of that, but the thing that got me is how slooooowwww the service is. We ordered fairly quickly and the it took forever for the food to come out. I hope that they get it figured out and pick up the pace because this place has potential, especially in a neighborhood that lacks these cute, trendy places."}
{"text":"I have gone twice both for lunch, the restaurant is charming but anyone can make  trendy country decor. The food is hit and miss. They need to figure out what is working and what is not, there is no consistency. 

First time we ordered the chips and dip, was a hit and had unique texture and taste. The apple chicken sandwich was falling apart and light but nothing to write home about. The bruschetta was blah.

Second time was a birthday celebration and two haven't been there before. I fore warned not to get their hopes up. Two ordered the mushroom burger, cashier didn't ask the temp, so it came our well done. Looked like a flat dry piece of meat. Then the strawberry chicken salad on field greens was disappointing due to the chicken being over cooked and so dry we had trouble cutting it let alone swallowing it.

I ordered the margarita pizza to play it safe this time. It was flavorful and good. With the overall experience it's not worth the wait, time, or money. I might try it again in a few months after they work some kinks out!"}
{"text":"I've been back several more times. Sad to say that they haven't gotten the service issues fixed. You just need to go and realize that you have to accept what they bring and how they serve it. Condiments that you want and service are just not going to happen. Example: breakfast toast served with no butter or jelly. Server disappears and doesn't return until you beg to get the check.  Asked for salsa with the eggs and also didn't get that. The food was ok but when you pay for a meal out, people tend to want the things that they expected. I agree with others that the tables are too small (chairs too). LOUD most of the time unless you sit outside."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Bread, bread and bread. This place looks great but it is bad. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is an excellent addition to the area.  Its a great indoor/outdoor space with a very relaxed atmosphere.  Actually, I think its a little too relaxed.  My family was greeted right away upon entering and were given a table outside.  It was seriously 10 minutes before anybody even noticed us to take a drink order or at least say hi.  It wasn't even that busy (5:45pm on a Tuesday) so it was odd.  My wife lost the coin toss so she had to walk inside to ask wtf the deal was.  They sent one of the bus boys to take our drink order which finally came 10 minutes after that.  Our actual waitress was very very nice but that was about it.  Our appetizers came out 30 seconds before our entree which didn't even matter because we didn't have any silverware.  I lost the coin toss on that one so I had to walk inside to steal some off another table.

I have to say though, this place does have the food going for it at least.

*  wedge salad = excellent.  One of the best I've had.  The reduced balsamic was a nice touch as was the plentiful bacon
* fried mac n' cheese balls = omg so good.  and that dipping sauce..holy cow I just had a heart attack
* burgers = very good burgers for a bar type place
* peach iced tea = gross...I normally don't Yelp ice tea but this was awful

Anyway, I will be back.  I like the atmosphere and the food was good.  The happy hour specials were decent too but I didn't get to take advantage because my family was invisible for 15 minutes to a waitress."}
{"text":"Ugh. The service needs some work. The kitchen sent the meals out for our party of 11 with 5-10 minute gaps between each of us. We all ended up eating separately. Either that, or let each plate get cold. Not a very fun evening. No apologies from anyone. The restaurant lost out on our dessert revenue. Went up the street to spend that for fear that we would be stuck there for another hour. The food is good but it's not really worth the frustration. We'll be back but if this kind of service happens again, I will sadly write this place off."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fried Chicken Bowl... And it is not a Bowl. It is a piece of boneless chicken (likely frozen) on a plate of sweet potato fries, 5 pieces of salad leaves, a sprinkling of corn, and a teaspoonful of tomato (paste?). I ordered more salad, and they wanted to charge me $1.50. Should have read the reviews before I came here. Too bad the place looks nice. Avoid, avoid!!"}
{"text":"PLEASE MANAGEMENT, work on making sure that food is delivered in a timely manner. Having to wait for dinner with kids is not fun as much as we love our children.

We ordered the mac and cheese balls, they were really good. So was the bean soup (very tasty) however, here comes the bad news. The Cesar salad was awful, it came with dressing on it however it seemed so dry. I asked for extra dressing, I was given an ounce of dressing, not enough to make a difference in the taste. The chicken in it was dry and was cut into big chunks, wasn't sure if i was eating the croutons of chicken. Maybe slice the chicken instead of chopping them up in big bite size pieces? Also, please when you deliver food to a table, make sure you give your customers forks and spoons. Please? Having to wait to eat your salad because you are not given forks, SUCKS.  

My mom ordered the kale salad was good but was over charged by 3 dollars when we received the bill. Bummer. Glad we caught it.

Burgers were too salty, the kids ate the fries, not the burgers. Waste of food.

Kids mac and cheese is da bomb. Yes, I ate off my daughters plate because my salad was yucky.

My sister ordered a pizza but it looked under cooked, blah. I didn't even want to try it.

Desserts are wonderful!!! Cheesecake is amazing as is the bread pudding.

Please work on cleaning up the menu! This place can be a great neighborhood joint but your restaurant decor is FOR SURE is outshining your food.

Will I come back? Probably not......not until I see Yelp reviews stating the places has changed for the better.

I hate these kind of reviews but someone needs to tell Modern Grove that their food isn't so \"modern\" at this point. Could have cooked it at home kind of meal.

Our waiter was AWESOME though!!!!!! I forgot his name but he did great."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch last week and was hopeful that the Yelp reviews weren't accurate, but unfortunately, I think they are spot on.  The place is adorable - nicely decorated and a great pet friendly patio.  The staff was pretty nice and the food came out pretty quick, but it really was underwhelming.  I tried the harissa chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries at the recommendation of the staff.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but the sandwich was dry and really not that good.  Hopefully they can work out the miss on the food as this place as the potential to be great!"}
{"text":"I've been here when it opened and it seems since then the crowd has died down.  Wait staff has changed a lot over the past year and recently for the good.  I still really enjoy this place and would love to see more locals out on any night....food is good...I've had the Kale salad, Chicken Panninis and other's...the local beer's are great....and It's not a loud place at all.....mostly why I like it :-)"}
{"text":"I dont like to leave bad reviews until Ive been to a restaurant more than once... So this is trip number 4 and I will not be back. Every time I have been there the service is slow, slow, slow, they run out of menu items etc, but today was inexcusable.  I ordered the bruschetta plate, and my friend ordered a sandwich at 12:15.  At 12:30 her sandwich came out.  I assumed mine would be out shortly.  I went to the cashier at 12:45 and asked about it.  She said it was just coming out. I watched as 2 other tables got their food (who ordered after me).  Meanwhile my friend finished her sandwich and we are ready to leave, so at 1:00 I go and ask for my money back which they did with no problem, and hardly an apology or any explanation. At 1:15 as we were getting ready to leave they bring out my bruschetta plate. I was completely puzzled and told them I didnt want it and that is why I asked for my money back and was on my way out.  They seemed surprised, gave a half assed apology, and gave it to another table.  The food isnt bad, but its definitely not good enough to wait an hour for an appetizer!  There are plenty of restaurants with good food and consistent good service. I will not waste my time or money here anymore.  On a side note - Sunday brunch should not end at 11:00.  Breakfast can end at 11,  but brunch?"}
{"text":"Positive and negatives to this new place:
Positives: fun, clean, friendly service, and good prices.
Negatives: uncomfortable seats, chef has a heavy hand with the salt (specifically the Mac and cheese balls/french fries), bacon is TOO smokey whoa, and the potato salad came as a surprise when it was made with sweet potatoes and really tasted and had the same consistency as baby food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their staff and the decor and more importantly the food. My children loved the fruit and sandwiches as well my husband and I enjoyed our burgers and french fries. Food had such great flavor and was cooked to perfection! The staff was eager to help my family and myself from the moment we entered the door. I don't know about you but if that isn't great customer service then I don't know what it is! I will definitely return soon and tell all my friends and family about the new and exciting Modern Grove. I give them !"}
{"text":"Modern grove has an excellent environment and fast service, but the food quality is a wide range.  Sometimes quite good, sometimes not very good at all.  Until they get a grip on consistency, I cannot feel good overall about the experience."}
{"text":"Meh. Lots of hype from co-workers, so we were anxious to try this new neighborhood eatery. Very cute inside - market-like -  with a inside/outside bar. Good sized outdoor eating area, covered with artificial turf. They even have a beanbag toss games to keep the kiddies occupied (or many grown-ups) while waiting for their food. 

We went the burger route - bacon cheddar and the turkey burger.  Both were huge. The turkey burger was moist and flavorful.  I ordered the half and half fries - won't do that again. The sweet potato fries are forgettable. The burgers were good, but  not outstanding . But we went to MG for burgers, not a gourmet meal. Will we go back? Maybe, but it's not at the top of our list."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to go to try their veggie burger. Unfortunately the same experience as previously reported.  Slow, poor service, lack luster feel overall.  The food was once again tasty.   Gosh, get your service fixed and I'll come by regularly."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple of to go salads from them today. For $24 the salads were nothing special and the strawberry chicken salad, which the cashier recommended, was so underdressed that I think maybe they forgot the dressing. I had to add my own dressing or I would not have been able to eat it. The staff was friendly, but probably won't become a regular here after this experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are great, however the service is far below superior. I've come here several times hoping the service will improve...still disappointed. Probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went there with my 2 year old daughter and had an awesome experience.  Our waiter, Zack was outstanding and we enjoyed the kale salad and margarita pizza.  My daughter gobbled up every bite of her creamy mac and cheese, too!  This place is cozy and definitely makes you feel like you are in a local neighborhood restaurant.  We will be back to try the bruschetta."}
{"text":"We had our daughters rehearsal dinner there for 75 people everything and I mean everything was absolutely perfect drinks were outstanding food was great, outside Atmosphere by fireplace was amazing wait staff could not have been any nicer. We highly recommend Modern Grove an outstanding local restaurant thank you thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"We have dined at Modern Grove once before and it was uneventful. That changed on St. Patrick's Day. Okay, it was a little busier than normal, but far from capacity. 

It took a long time to get waited on. Perhaps the wait staff was spread too thin. After ordering and waiting almost an hour for our food, during which our waiter assured us multiple times that it was almost ready, he finally admitted that the kitchen had lost our order. We had to start from scratch. When the food finally arrived,  it was clear that the chicken had been sitting out for some time, and the green vegetable side dishes had been coated in oil and not really cooked at all. It was really a bad meal.

They did do the right thing and comped both meals, but it was so bad that I have really lost my taste for going there again. They only get a second star because I like the concept. It probably should have been one."}
{"text":"OMG. OPEN at 7am FOR BRECKFAST! ! I love the pastries , coffee is awesome, and owner is way cool."}
{"text":"Great food with a relaxed atmosphere.  The outdoor patio is great when the weather is nice. The staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"We needed a place like this in the neighborhood! 

The family and I checked it out for a late lunch yesterday. Cool space in the new strip mall. Order at the counter and find your own seat.

I had the bacon cheddar burger with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious

The Mac and cheese bites were delicious.

My wife had the vegetable panini which she really liked.

Our service was great and overall we both loved it.


Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everytime we drive passed this place it's packed. My family and I stopped in for some lunch.  Line went fast, about 20 min wait, Well Worth It! I had the marinated steak panini, melts in your mouth! The fries are on the spot! Crispy on the outside soft on the inside.  My fiancé loved the cheddar bacon burger.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Empty on a Saturday morning- multiple tables stacked with dirty dishes for the hour I was there. Waited 15 minutes for an Americano to be delivered... And it was as clear as iced tea. Cute place, but doesn't live up to the intention it might have as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Worlds worst service and the food isn't even that good! Staff are completely rude and/or clueless!

Gave it a dozen tries bc it's our local but EVERY SINGLE time we encountered rude staff and rarely got a meal! The management turnover is a weekly occurrence!

Won't be returning!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, it could be better. Granted I was with 7 others on a Monday but we could have had better service and the food was really lackluster. I don't understand when a group comes in with a request for separate cheques, you know you are making a lot more than on a single table in general and the servers disappear. We were the only other table in the place besides the one two top who was leaving as we came in and a small family while we were there. I had a burger which was passable. I asked for mid-rare, got medium.  Fries were OK. Concept is good, with doggie play area and adult fun nights with painting and hors d'oeuvres. I don't care for dismissive service and the bartender did nothing but stand around. He could have hustled some extra drinks on the group but elected not to.   I did hear a guy in the bank today  suggesting to his friend that they go to Modern Grove this evening.Maybe it was an off night. I always think that if you have no pressure, you would try to make it really good. I would elect to try something different."}
{"text":"Modern Grove has the look of a Bud Light commercial. You know the one. Its outside in a cool looking backyard. Everyone is looking good even the dog that one person brought is cool. Then you have the 2 guys who bring more Bud Light at the exact time the music stops cause someone drank the last one and everyone thinks the party is over. Or the one where you walk inside the place and everyone knows who you are and you see the most gorgeous girl in the place and she sees you. So you nod to the bartender and he gives you the Bud Light to give to her. But instead you just look at her and slide it down the bar 50ft. And everyone just happens to move their drinks and purses out of the way at the exact time the beer travels down the bar. Not knowing a beer is traveling down the bar. And when the beer gets to her all that she sees is a phone number attach to the bottle cause you know she's going to call. And she does later on that night. Yeah. Modern Grove has THE LOOK of that! Exciting right? But man after eating at this place I was left with only one word and feeling...meh.

If you couldn't tell by my little story. The place looks great. It has the feeling like it should be the place to be anytime of day. It just doesn't have anything that makes it pop. Our server was nice. Everyone was nice. They were just meh.  We got the Mac N Cheese balls. Of course they sold it like it was so good. I bit into one and it was meh.  No flavor at all.  I got a shroom burger and sweet potato fries.  Again the burger and fries were meh. Just as bland as bland could be. If I could give a color rating instead of a star rating it would be beige. Cause when I first went in there I was full of energy wanting to do all kinds of things today. When I left I was like \"what do you want to do?\" \"Nuttin.\" It just brought me down to not want to do anything the rest of the day. The bathroom had some weird chair in the corner like you're suppose to sit there and give advice to anyone who comes in to use the toilet. Or cheer them on if they have a hard time doing a #2. The drinking glasses that were given to us were dirty. So they gave us another set and those were dirty too and had lipstick on one of the glasses. If I ever go here again it would probably be for the bar at night. The place looks great, but the inside is dull and doesn't have much quality to offer. Its like the Kim Kardashian of restaurants."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is great! Really good mimosas as well. The only down side of this place is the price; it's a little overpriced for what you get. Other than that, great place for kids and pets. The outdoor seating makes it a prime spot all year except summer in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We go on Sunday's for dinner. The managers are super friendly always greet you with a smile.  The food is clean and Delish. My son loves the macaroni and fruit. We highly recommend the Bruchetta - I have been to expensive place for Bruchetta and paid over 200 for a family of 4 here it's amazing and 13.00. Macaron i.e. bites, tuna sandwich, pizza , burgers salad all amazing. have not been disappointed. atmosphere is clean and fun- I still want to try breakfast looks great .Not greasy in any way - Delish and healthy options available."}
{"text":"We visited Modern Grove on 6/26/17. We were approached by our server when we walked in. She said we could sit wherever we wanted. She took our drink order immediately and mentioned the special of the day. Drinks arrived within 5 minutes. There was a mix up on the drink however she took back and apologized. I ordered the special flatbread and my guest ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Flat. Both items arrived in less than 10 minutes and were very hot.Server didn't return till we were almost done. My guest got up to get drink refills. The food was delicious. The restaurant and restrooms were clean. My only recommendation is that they distinguish whether they are going to be a full service or self serve restaurant. It's complicated not knowing where to order when you walk in and how to get drink refills. Server was friendly however if full service restaurant needed more professional training."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited when Modern Grove opened, we live near by. We've been there 3 times. # 1 beers are NOT cold. #2 service is slow and often have to look for your server #3 wait time for food seems a little too long. We have always been able to get a seat without having to wait. We have been disappointed with them. We will not go back until we have heard better reviews.  I  hope the management  looks at these reviews and attempts to make changes."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in at about 8 to grab dinner and drinks.. The ambience is really unique and fun and the menu options are great! We shared Mac n Cheese bites and had sangrias.. Food was out quick and the service was friendly. Patio is dog friendly so it's a perfect place for a chill night with friends and fam"}
{"text":"First visited this restaurant when they initially opened.  Was very pleased.  Took a guest there last night and was beyond disappointed with the terrible service and the disappointing food.  Took nearly 15 minutes to just order water.  After placing our food order, it took over 45 minutes for the food to come out.  Ordered the white pizza.  The only topping was supposed to be arugula.  Instead it came out lukewarm with full leaf, raw spinach just dumped on the top of the lukewarm pizza.  Spoke with our waiter, Ryan, who said he was also the supervisor/manager.  He just brushed it off and said they were very busy and probably ran out of ingredients and so the chef substituted the raw spinach.  He was very indifferent and offered no apologies.  In fact, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the waiter never even smiled once.  Only concession offered was to prepare a new pizza for us.  After already waiting an hour we decided to pay for our drinks and leave.  Went next door to Venezia's for incredible mouth watering pizza.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"Takes a page from the LGO/Liberty Market blueprint for creating the neighborhood friendly market/bar that seems to be ever popular these days.  Unlike others my service was prompt and like most others my meal was good."}
{"text":"I still have the terrible taste in my mouth. Not to be unfair, the server was pleasant. Beautiful exterior and interior design- thought we would give it a shot. Once we got seated, it took about 10 minutes to get greeted by someone who wasn't our server. We were first greeted by a cricket hopping around our feet. Then our server came, we placed our orders for a kilt lifter, glass of wine, bruschetta and pretzels and beer (pretzels, cheese, mustard). It took about 20 minutes to receive the drinks and about 40 minutes for the appetizers. Pretzels were ok, the cheese dipping sauce was grainy and cold (ew!) and the bruschetta was, presentation included, all around disgusting. We ordered \"the miracle\" pizza (hey, we had our hopes high for this place!) balsamic took over the whole thing. The only miracle was when we finally got out of there and arrived at samurai sams across the street. Create yourselves a miracle today by choosing another restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came in for a late night meal. This place is awesome the food was good. The service was very fast. We even got some free pastries for being the last customer. Normally the waiters and the staff hate the end of day people but they are great!"}
{"text":"This place is a Panera-wannabe. Nothing was great, nothing terrible. That's all I can say. I wouldn't be in any rush to return."}
{"text":"On the fence about my stars, Every table was dirty and looked as if they just had a mad rush of diners, but it was 3:00 in the afternoon. The blue chairs are pretty comfortable but the metal ones are pretty hard, avoid those. 
I'm surprised they didn't have more gluten free options, like bread their Paninis or buns for the burgers. They offer a $14 gluten free pizza, didn't go with that because i had pizza just the night before.
My Alex had the Strawberry Chicken Salad and i looked delish. Alex really liked it, huge chunks of goat cheese. I had the Bacon Cheddar Burger protein style (no bun, wrapped in butter lettuce) and sweet potato fries. The burger was juicy and savory, cooked perfectly,  My sweet potato fries were not hot but tasted good.  
Really good lunch. Sure, like many have mentioned in the reviews, the service is slow, but it was made up with the really good food. Staff was really friendly. Although, i did see two different times that servers talking out food and can't locate where to deliver it and circle around and back to discuss where it suppose to go. That happen twice. Everyone orders their food at the front and gets a number on a stand. I am thinking, that system is not working out very well or theyare having an off day. 
I think we'd like to try Modern Grove again, their salads look interesting."}
{"text":"Very cute set up. Feels like a casual snacky, shop. That probably makes little sense but too bad lol. I'm in Phoenix on biz and dropped in for breakfast. A touch pricy but the food was tasty and the coffee was flowing.

Staff here was very friendly and the woman running the register was adorable. 

There is a little shop included which seems odd on the surface but adds well to the decor and ambiance. Loving the outdoor seating area as well, definitely pet friendly."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pleasant. My order was slightly incorrect...the server who brought it to me was in a rush (not sure why as it was not busy when I was there) had to explain what needed to be fixed as he was walking away from the table. He looked at the receipt and said \"yep, it is wrong\" which I thought was a little annoying. Food is over priced and very bland. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, wasn't horrible but wasn't great. Gentleman with longer hair taking the orders was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Cool setting and environment.  I really wanted to like the food because of this, but it was only so-so.  The bar is nice and they have good beers on draft and it's not overly expensive.  I wouldn't come back for the food, but I'd go back to have a drink and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Was in the area and passed by this super cute eatery. I loved the set up out side the patio looked super relaxing and cute. You can even take your dogs on the patio. We decide to try it for lunch. Reminded me a lot like the restaurant Flower Child inside. The food was really good. The only thing upsetting was we ordered drinks from the bar and it took over 15 minutes to get them. But overall we loved it."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  In the beginning their prices were reasonable but service definitely nothing to brag about.  The servers in general act as if they are above you and are doing you a favor by serving you.  My review pertains to the last two times I dined there. Our server, Nichole was borderline rude and unattentive.  The kale salad doubled in price!  The last time I was there was just chaos!  Took forever to get my glass of wine.  The waiter actually said \"I bet you thought you were never going to get this\"  Really!  My salad came way after my sons meal came and it was missing the cheese.  There are only 4 ingredients on the salad so, it needs the cheese. It took forever to flag someone down to get some cheese.  Needless to say,  I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"We go there and we got settled then it took 10 - 20 mins to get water and a waiter. It took 30-40 mins. to get drinks. Then it took 1 and 30 mins or more to get food. Which was 2 PB and J, pizza and a filly stake sandwich. There was only 2 waiters outside and the 2 same kind of waiters inside. There were ton of chefs inside cooking/baking."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday to work. Finally stopped by on my day off with my daughter. I got the chopped salad and she got the chicken panini. The salad I could of made at home and better. I am not kidding when I say it had one slice of bell pepper, a few bits of cheese and pepperoni. It was all lettuce. If I'm going to pay 9.00 for a chopped salad I am going to get my money's worth and go up the street to Oreganos. My daughter's panini was bland and the fries that came with it were underdone (hard inside and cold). The place is attractive and the outdoor bar is really nice. But, the food doesn't cut it. Will not go back nor would I recommend."}
{"text":"6/24/16 first time...last time here.  Like many other reviewers, I had driven by here several times and wanted to give the place a shot for dinner.  Arrived close to 7pm and it was rather empty, never a positive on a Friday evening but hey, wanted to give it a shot.  The place is nice, kinda get the Pita Jungle vibe inside.   The wait staff is very friendly.  

Ordered brushetta and was disappointed in the size of the bread and the portion of toppings served.  Flavor was lacking in the ingredients.  No seasoning, no basil, no garlic.

The bread with the sandwich I ordered (ciabatta) was so hard, I could not saw my teeth through it to enjoy the whole sandwich.  Opened it up and ate the contents with a fork and found that too was lacking flavor and seasoning, not to mention, very little meat.  I left half the sandwich on my plate untouched.

The fries (I had regular and my guest had sweet potato) tasted frozen, not fresh.

The price point here is very high for the quality of ingredients and servings.  Not what people in this area are going to be willing to pay with their hard earned money.  If you are going to have Scottsdale/Biltmore prices on salads and sandwiches, you need to deliver, Modern Grove sadly fell short..."}
{"text":"We went for lunch a few weeks ago. I ordered a pizza which overwhelmingly tasted burnt. My mother ordered potato salad Which was bland and tasteless. The fountain was broken and squirted sprite all over your hand. Don't know if I will try this again."}
{"text":"Good food. We've been many times and also done takeout. It's also dog friendly on the patio. The beers are good. The turkey burger is a favorite too. The sweet potato fries are great. They brought out some chicken for our dog once - the staff is fantastic and friendly. Seems a lot of people want lower prices, but we think it's priced right. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"So bad, I had to take the time to write my first review. Seriously, don't ever come here. Horrible service,  Cesar salad tasted like it came out of a bag,  with processes chicken, panini had soggy bread. We ordered a side of fries that never came! It wasn't busy and good took 46 minutes to come out! Really, it's just bad. I ended up eating my sons left over pizza crust! Save yourself some money and buy yourself a Big Mac."}
{"text":"This place is locally owned for a few now. I usually get their salads (chicken strawberry salad) in the picture below. The price is $12 plus tax, slightly on the expensive side but hey, you pay what you get for. Their portion is decent, you feel stuffed and gets you through the day. I usually get my food to go here but you can comfortably dine in. The atmosphere is pretty homie."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not as imaginative or special as I had hoped. Wedge Salad was solid.  The 4 cheese panino lacks any special touches or flavors.  This place has a great deal of potential with a few tweaks.  Got free deserts to try, that is a great touch to gain wider favor.  Staff was a bit over eager but that is likely due to it being opening day"}
{"text":"Nice place to let the kids run around on the patio on a warm evening. Food....meh.I have had both breakfast and lunch here and both times left disappointed."}
{"text":"Well how can you say great service when it's self service? Ordered 2 different pizzas, both very mediocre to say the least, however the manager overheard our conversation and very politely offered us something else. My son opted for a panini turkey and ham sandwich which he said was very good. I ordered Italian anti pasta salad........well\" hunt for the meat\" would have been a better name for it. Bowl full of green mix well dressed......but where's the meat?
$31 for 2 bad pizzas a coffee and a soda really? No service and a server whose pants were filthy dirty and who wiped off plates (which had to be requested) with equally questionable dirty fingers! Very pleasant management, but expensive disappointing food. Will not return."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio, it was four adults, a toddler and a dog.  We grabbed a table outside and told someone inside and they brought out menus and took our drink orders.  They have a large selection of beer and wines, but a little pricey for me. For apps, we had broccoli cheddar soup, turkey chili and some sweet potato fries.  All were delicious.  The fries were crispy unlike many other restaurants, even my brother in law who says he doesn't like sweet potato fries chowed down on them as well as the toddler.  I ordered a strawberry chicken salad that blew my mind. I didn't really even talk through the dinner as my taste buds were so thrilled with what I was providing them.  Husband had the veggie sandwich (added bacon...yup), others had the roast sandwich (table favorite) and the chicken salad sandwich.  The kiddo got the pizza (huge btw) but was too interested in fruit and french fries to enjoy the thin crust and fresh mozzarella.  We all left full and very happy to have stumbled upon this place.  We will definitely be back.  They also have a fireplace and a few corn hole setups on the patio.  There were kids running around playing, but we like that sort of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hi - tonight after multiple second chances I went to have dinner there. The manager (surly looking rude ... I am sure you know the one) was slouched over the bar, reading the Safeway coupon magazine. I asked for the happy hour wine - \"too bad buddy happy hour finished at 6pm. It was 2 minutes past 6. He then sunk back into the coupons, presumably finding a $1 off toilet paper was more important than being pleasant.

He was such a rude - condescending horrible person to have behind a bar (with the possible exception being prison) that I just could not bring myself to spend 1 moment more in his presence - so I left.

You guys have such a good thing going and you can not get out of your own way by hiring such idiots"}
{"text":"They don't have as many clean eating options as one would think but you can get the stuff to order.  Nice selection of sandwiches and salads.  I like that they serve ice coffee."}
{"text":"For an outdoor Christmas party this place cannot be beat.  Two great Christmas parties in two years and good times,good service."}
{"text":"Service was good bruschetta was amazing had a great recommendation for mamas lil pilsner from male manger who was very attentive to customers and staff."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so badly. While the atmosphere and design is 5 star, the food it just not great, especially for the prices. My first time I got the veggie panini, there was a blob of unseasoned veggies in the center that didn't even come close to covering all of the bread---either add more veggies or use smaller pieces of bread. The second time I got the Dr. Berry's Tabbouleh Quinoa bowl--the ratio of capers and greek olives was nearly 1 to 1 with the amount of quinoa and the chicken had zero seasoning or marinade. I don't know any good chef who would use that amount of capers and the funny part---this dish isn't even supposed to have capers! It's supposed to be healthy and \"Dr\" recommended...I hate to think the amount of sodium in what was served to me. I sincerely hope the manager reads these reviews and steps up the food game or lowers the prices to reflect what you are getting, because $14 for a bowl of capers is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I decided to meet friends at this artificial grass place in a mall strip are near Tatum.  The area is so cute, with an amazing view of the mountains. 

BUT THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE!!! I stay very true to what I feel and taste. The food here was anything but editable.  We ordered hummus with two different kinds of flat breads.  

The hummus looked like dog food but the taste was even worse.  The flatbread came a semi warm. One had a Hawaii twist with pineapple syrup....

 Thanks  for trying but no thanks.  It's wasn't good at all.  I just picked off the pepperoni on top.  

Let's just say this place will never see me again unless they change the menu or get a new cook."}
{"text":"Really great new place! Hip decor, good food, great beer prices. The service was a little messy, but not surprising since they're new. Looking forward to trying this place again!"}
{"text":"The ONLY thing going for this place is the inside that is about it. Got the Mac n Cheese Balls Mac n cheese Dried out now i see why the cheese sauce comes with it. The Turkey and \"Cheddar\" Panini was crap turkey tasted like 2 day old turkey from thanksgiving couldn't even see cheese on the panini all could taste was the mustard sauce. The server was to nervous and so glittery took 45 minutes to get food and then another 10 to get a straw. They don't even have drink items on the menu?......The burger was so char tasting because they smash the burgers they are paper thin and then pile on all the \"Organic Crap\". I'm surprised the water was even cold. Then i gave the server a $100 my bill was $9.74 she gives me change for my girlfriends sisters bill whose was $26.....The staff doesn't know whats going on. I would NOT recommend this place at all. Like i said its a nice building and that's about it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my home and a favorite of my family. We've tried practically everything on the menu, and I can say have never had a bad meal.  The mushroom hamburger is amazing and so is the pizza bianca! The atmosphere here is great and it is very nice when the weather is good to sit outside.  The one thing that I can say is lacking is the service.  The restaurant goes for a laid-back hipster ambiance, but the staff takes it to extreme.  While we have never had an unpleasant waiter/waitress, most have been very slow and do not check in regularly. We usually wait an inordinately long time to get drinks at first, and then even longer for refills."}
{"text":"For a quick bite to eat at a great price try this place. The sandwiches are good and garlic fries that go with are super. But the salads are small and not very innovative. I had a chicken Cesar salad but it was not that good. I think I'll try the kale salad next time or one of the yummy looking Panini sandwiches I saw on the table next to me. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"cute neighborhood place BUT we were handed a happy hour menu (Friday 4pm) and ordered several items from it... all great BUT when bill came and i noted the difference she said \"this is Monday thru Thursday\"..... ummmmm why is hostess handing me a hh menu???? watch out!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance, simply because it is so close to our house, and it would be a shame to not like it. This time we had the kale and chorizo pizza and the kale salad.  Both were good, and the fact our daughter could play makes this place worth it. Service is still a little lackluster, but getting better."}
{"text":"I'm starting lose faith in people's reviews on yelp. This place is great. Awesome vibe, great service, and even better food. You get exactly what you pay for."}
{"text":"First, EXCEPTIONAL service! Really. They went out of their way for us, and we're so sweet & friendly about it. Second, everything was SO good! Chicken tortilla soup so good I nearly licked the bowl, and my husband had to swat me away from his perfectly crispy sweet potato fries. They were fast, too, which was awesome It's also darling & has lots of outdoor seating. Zero complaints, tons of compliments!! What a happy find!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept, great food and more importantly great service. 

I had the burger with potato salad.  The potato salad is amazing.   

I also ordered the Kale salad, delish!  I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Give this place another try. I tried it a few times when it first opened but was not impressed. Just stopped in for a glass of wine and bruschetta and had a great time. The food was yummy and the service was great. I would love if it was full service all the time but the improvements they've made show they are really trying to offer a great neighborhood wine bar. The goat cheese red pepper bruschetta is amazing!"}
{"text":"After my first visit I was impressed, service from multiple people and great attention.  But today it's not busy and we get seating by host and do not even get a hello from anyone that may resemble a waiter for 20 minutes!  

Then we get an \" I'll be with you in a second\" from a guy walking by, and he disappears not to be seen before we give up and leave.  Told the waitress we just don't have that much time to wait before even getting a waiter.  Food is priced too high for this kind of service to be acceptable...."}
{"text":"Modern Grove never fails to disappoint. Great location, good atmosphere, super nice staff, Very average food. 

I've tried several items and they never are as good as I hope. Pizza with hot soggy crust. Flavorless sandwiches. A few visits ago they served a customer the salad out of the display - not at the customers request - they forgot to make it so to expedite the error they took it out of the display. 

It's really too bad. I want to really like this place but, eh?  Maybe their breakfast is good? Maybe."}
{"text":"Food is good. 

Problem - we are here at 8pm and the interior is lit up like an operating room. Want a glass of wine and relaxation - why do we need 450 watt lights?? 

Seats are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We had the Chorizo wrap and Pancake with apple and both were delish. They have a huge patio and we always bring our babies with us. They can even wip up some food for our babies. I just wish they have a more extensive menu."}
{"text":"Update: I come and place pick up orders all the time because Modern Grove is so close to me and I want to support an establishment that's close. I've always enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, but we decided to order lunch today and sadly, it was a fail. We ordered sweet potato fries, the cubano panini and roasted vegetable panini. My vegetable panini was ok, fries weren't that great and hubby said his panini was awful. That says a lot because he is not one to get as disappointed as me. He actually could only eat half. Not sure if we will be returning especially since prices are not cheap.

Original: I did not actually dine at the restaurant, but I had my hubby order breakfast here to go this morning. We ordered the granola yogurt parfait and the breakfast sandwich. Both were surprisingly good. The parfait was good and it had granola, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and mandarin oranges. The breakfast sandwich had tomato mayo,  fried egg, avocado and cheese.

They salted the fried egg a little too much, but it was still good. Prices are a little high. For both items, we paid around $18. I would come back and dine for lunch and update my review. For now, solid three stars."}
{"text":"Sadly this place went downhill:( The food is just okay and the prices have gone up. I'm bummed because I really thought this was going to be our new favorite place. Everything I've had in the last year hasn't been that great. I would compare it to Chili's (but Chili's might be better). There is rarely more then 10 people in the entire restaurant (including outside).

The only saving grace is they now have a full bar. Just don't sit at the bar at a \"off\" hour because a bartender is hard to find. I've sat at the bar for 20 minutes before going to the counter asking for a drink. Really...I don't think a couple people sitting at the bar are invisible! 

It has a great outdoor area to bring kids and dogs. They provide sidewalk chalk and corn-hole to keep the kids and some adults entertained.

I really hope they can turn it around. It's something our neighborhood would embrace again! Make food worth the price charged. They have \"Biltmore\" prices and below average food. Have an attentive staff that notices and cares when a customer walks in. 
(Side bar: The staff is always very nice just not observant of the people in the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw a new place opened up so wanted to give it a try. Food was okay. Kind of bland. It was super loud while we were there. Wish there was more shade outside so we could have ate out there. Not sure if we will try it again"}
{"text":"It was good food (superb bacon) but the atmosphere is a bit more hipster than I typically enjoy.  It seemed a little on the pricey side but it may be worth it depending on what you get."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was blown away. My date and I ordered a Bianca Pizza and a Strawberry Salad. Both were outstanding. Our waiter, Matt, was attentive and super friendly. Even the manager came by to talk to us about our visit. Likewise, all of the staff had excellent customer service. The food on the menu was reasonable and the design of the restaurant was really fun and inviting. After today's visit, I will definitely be back! This is such a neat place!

I am sad to read other reviews where people did not enjoy this place as much as I had. I can't imagine having a bad visit here because my recent visit was that fantastic."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I WANTED to love this place. However I experienced the same issues everyone else did - long waits for food, weird and slow service (they put in my husbands order - he asked for no onions, came out and told us the onions were premixed so he ordered something else, then came back out and said we changed it back to the first item because we were wrong about the onions), and mediocre food. I loved the atmosphere and the decor. 

Luckily, after reading a few reviews, I knew we might be in for a wait, so we came prepared to keep our kids occupied. I will most likely go back in a couple of months and hope that they heed all of these Yelp reviews. If they are able to improve the food quality and the wait/service issues, then this will turn into a 5 start place for sure!"}
{"text":"Modern grove is a local restaurant tocated at Tatum and Greenway. This place specializes in home grown , organic local choices ranging from pizza to salads. One of my favorites is the turkey burger. Its served with your choices of vegetables ; but what's best is that its extremely juicy. Great selection of beer and wines too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's in our neighborhood, but we've now been there for both brunch & dinner and were disappointed both times. The atmosphere is so cute and the patio set up is great. However the food is terrible. We were with a party of 5 for dinner, and all of us thought our food was just blah. Then my husband & I went for brunch, and both did not like our meals then either. I hope they improve their food! I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"This is probably my 10th time coming to Modern Grove and time after time I am seriously disappointed. I love the atmosphere, the interior and exterior...it definitely gives it that \"neighborhood eatery\" feel to it. Unfortunately, the only thing I absolutely love on the menu are their sweet potato fries and I've still had better! 

Tonight, I did take out and ordered the strawberry chicken salad with no pecans and extra goat cheese. When I got home and looked at the salad, all that was there was too much greens, a couple chicken cubes, 3 strawberries, and NO goat cheese. I ask for extra and I get nothing? Not only was there a lack of items in the salad, it looked as if they just through it together with no care in the world...no presentation whatsoever. I had to DIG to find chicken and strawberries.

I hate giving a restaurant bad reviews since I am in the service industry but this place definitely needs to train their kitchen staff to put effort into the food but also do it quickly."}
{"text":"Oh boy! They could really use some good management. Great concept but the poor employees have NO clue what they are doing. Maybe they opened too soon!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while so went over for lunch. The menu they hand out has items that are not on the board and the \"lines\" were disorganized for ordering. I ordered one of the pizzas that support a charity. The food took way too long to receive and although I really like arugula, I also paid for prosciutto and it was sorely lacking. Not sure I would try again. They've had enough time to figure things out. Cool vibe but parking is also,a challenge."}
{"text":"Very excellent service.  Only if they can get the food to match it. Lol try mamas little pill beer that they serve. Great!! And the atmosphere is on point. Food not so good"}
{"text":"Had an excellent time at Modern Grove. A fun location with a market and an extended patio for those beautiful Arizona nights. The inside has a good and contemporary look to it. Defiantly trendy  for the Scottsdale market. The only knock I have on the place is its identity. It has a bar, a sit down area and a market. It would be nice if they maybe choose to be either a market, like Luci's on Bethany Home Rd, or strictly a restaurant. Other than that the service was fantastic. My hail kale salad was solid and my Pic had a burger that was outstanding. I would definitely recommend it to others, I would just hope that they choose an identity so more people can pack the place."}
{"text":"First time to visit this new restaurant in my neighborhood.  I arrived about 820 a.m. on a Friday and noticed right away how attractive the restaurant is. High ceiling; Walls of windows/doors (open to morning's cool breeze); Nice bar area; and Music (although a little too loud). 

Ordering is done at the counter and menus are displayed on walls; easy to read. There were two women ordering and one gentleman ahead of me.  It took more than five minutes for me to order. The woman at the counter was very pleasant and I ordered the breakfast burrito. When the food arrived, it was tasty and I requested additional salsa which they provided. I thought the wait time was a bit longer than I expected (more than 6 minutes - for a breakfast burrito)

Seats are very uncomfortable (small, metal) but the open air concept is nice. 

I will be back with friends for dinner (I'm sure it'll be leisurely...) and I do hope the management reads these reviews and takes action. As a small business owner, I want to support local, neighborhood places. It's an attractive place and the menu appears tasty.  

(What's with the semi trucks in the parking lot running their generators - huh?)"}
{"text":"The chef has really improved the menu
New foods 
Even the vegetables are done to perfection

Love this restaurant

Wish it were closer to home"}
{"text":"We've tried this place twice, as we thought they deserved a second chance. We won't be going back.

On our first visit, we experienced poor service and mediocre food. Two of our people in our group had their food forgotten entirely, and it took well over an hour to finally get it. 

On our second visit, the service was slow, and one of the orders from our group was dropped on the floor and had to be remade. 

For the price, the food falls well short of expectations."}
{"text":"Modern Grill is a new restaurant providing fresh pizza, salads, and sandwiches in NE Phoenix. They also have a bar and small market area with wine, specialty jams and other unique grocery items. Their original location is in Flagstaff and they are now expanding to the metro Phoenix area. Several items are sourced locally for freshness and almost all dishes are made from scratch. On my first trip, I went for breakfast and ordered their bacon, egg and cheese panini. The egg was cooked perfectly for a sandwich and the bacon was very flavorful. Coffee is self serve in the morning, and available in a to go cup to top of for the road.  The staff is friendly and quick to serve customers, today even passing out free pumpkin muffins! I will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"I'm happy to have a cute place like this to enjoy happy hour in North Phoenix. The happy hour prices are extremely reasonable, especially if you're wanting to drown out the memories of your work day with 32-ounces of beer. The bruschetta was tasty, but the pieces were so teeny. The Mac n Cheese balls were crunchy and creamy, but you definitely need the dipping sauce with them, they don't stand alone well. The basic chips and salsa was satisfying, the salsa being sweet. 
I love the outdoor space with the fake grass, it's fun to sit and enjoy the outdoor area. The service is slow and mostly inattentive, but friendly. Not sure if that is because of the actual servers or because the place is new.
Overall - it's a trendy and causal atmosphere to enjoy a cheap happy hour, nothing gourmet or revolutionary about it."}
{"text":"I love the look of this place. So open and fresh. The indoor/outdoor bar seems so perfect with their relaxed, dog friendly patio. Complete with bags! The servers are friendly and their music is good. The menu looks tasty and slightly higher end. 

Then you sit down on their uncomfortably tiny chairs. Is my butt supposed to be that tiny? I'm not a large woman, but we did see two couples attempt to be seated at similar tables to ours that were... as soon as they were down, they were being resat. In the meantime, we ordered two drinks and an appetizer. We had been looking forward to a good happy hour all day! Oh wait, it's Friday, no happy hour here. Dang. The drinks came out quickly, so we entertained ourselves by watching the employees clamoring behind the food counter while we waited on the Caprese Grove Style. We had a lot to watch. I think the employees may have equated the customers, so I'm not entirely sure what they were running around or chatting about. After too long, we asked about our caprese and it appeared. The balsamic was very tasty, but the prosciutto was surprisingly dry. I was disappointed. The mac and cheese bites were just as dry and bland as the prosciutto, though their cheese sauce did help. But along with our tiny chairs, we had a tiny round table. With our two appetizers, we almost had to take off the salt and pepper shakers and decorative flower in order to eat. WAY too cramped. It made us have second thoughts about ordering a meal. And so, we were out.

I think if the food quality went up and more comfortable seating arrangements, this place could soar! I'm thinking your cooks are still getting used to the menus, so I'll give you that as reason for your slow ticket times. Please, please make me want to come back, Modern Grove. You're in the perfect location for me. I'd like to see you succeed, but not like this."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and have tried Modern Grove out a couple times now.  Once for a Saturday brunch... another for an early dinner.

For brunch, my wife tried the breakfast sandwich and I tried the turkey burger with a side of zucchini fries.  Both came out hot N fresh!  Wonderful portions and friendly service.

For early dinner, we tried the caprese sandwich and Cubano, both with a side of fries.  Once again, we sat and enjoyed friendly service and comfortable environment.

Next time, before it starts getting hot out... I think we will ride our bikes over for a nice lunch.

Thanks Modern Grove!!"}
{"text":"Quality food at reasonable prices with a pleasurable indoor and outdoor dining area makes Modern Grove a wonderful neighborhood spot.  If you ever lived in a New York/Chicago city neighborhood, Modern Grove is a lot like the little place around the corner that your family would walk to, buy a meal, and maybe a snack or drink for later.

For lunch, the restaurant acts as a semi-service cafeteria-like restaurant.  Order your food at the counter, get a number, and somebody will bring it to you.  There is also a market near the counter, where you can get a lot of bottles of wines, beers, and unique sodas.

There were two only two things about Modern Grove that really bugged me.
1.  The menu board at the counter is incomplete.
If you look around the restaurant there are other sandwiches and foods you can order.  Being a first-timer, I completely missed it.  If anything on those boards were something that would have interested me more than the panini I ordered, I guess I would've been SOL.
2.  No one bussed our plates.
I know Modern Grove isn't full service for lunch, but I didn't see any spot for us to get rid of our dirty plates.  We weren't in a rush to leave and they sat on our table the entire time.  Not one employee stopped by to ask if they could clear the table."}
{"text":"The fries were cold as ice, the burger seemed like it was a frozen patty. Bacon was more than likely microwaved. I was definitely not impressed overall I would compare the burger to a high end item on the jack in the box menu. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"First time in, ordered bacon cheese burger. Very good, fresh meat -real bacon- real lettuce (no iceberg) and it showed up without tomato as requested. Nice beer and wine selection, outdoor seating at bar area. Waitress is extremely nice. I will be back, if you live in the area you should try it!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Had the ABC burger.  Stick with the fries (great) and skip the O Rings (way too much batter and burnt)."}
{"text":"We had a steak panini and the grill chicken panini, nothing special. Just a regular panini. 

The place looks really good, would be a nice to sit outside and have a beer. But not my style of food."}
{"text":"The first impression I had when we walked in was, \"Wow, it's loud in here.\" It reminded me of a cafeteria. They sat the two of us at a tiny round table that had very little room. They had an unlit candle, a tall table number, a flower, and a bottle of water taking up the space (not to mention our water glasses, silverware, and menus). We got prompt service and I ordered a beer (which they didn't have, so I ordered a different one).

We ordered the bruschetta board and when it came the server looked at us, then at the tiny table, and at us again with a puzzled look. We tried to make room for this huge board she had in her hands. We told her she would need one of the two pizza racks in her other hand. She got it figured out and we made a comment about the tiny table. She then offered us tiny plates, we said no because there wasn't any room. We put the flower, candle, and number on the floor just to make room. The bruschetta was average. The best one was the salami pesto.

We ordered our food. My wife had the strawberry chicken salad and I had the bacon cheddar burger. There was nothing exciting about the salad. We asked about the chicken because it had a weird taste. Not a taste like it was bad, but like it was prepackaged and came out of a bag. We got the run around for a while and ended up getting a very vague response that didn't answer our question. The burger had all the flavor and excitement of a frozen \"hockey puck\" paddy. The fries were good, but I learned later that I could have gotten sweet potato fries but wasn't given the option.

On our way out, we went over to the market area and I watched the kitchen for a bit. What I saw here is the reason I will not go back. The kitchen was a hot mess. The floor was littered with trampled food. The cook was disheveled and did not look professional at all. He was wearing a pair of gloves, but I don't think he understands what the gloves are supposed to do. I watched him prepare a salad (including breaking cheese apart with his hands). Then bend down and open a drawer to get something else out. He grabbed the spatula and flipped a burger. He also grabbed a disgusting looking lid that was covering some vegetables, scooped up the vegetables with his hands, and then put them on someone's plate. He did all this with the same pair of gloves on. The gloves should be used for sanitary purposes, not to keep his hands clean. I never saw him change the gloves or clean his hands.

Overall, we were rather disappointed. Other than the decor, this place was nothing special. We could have stayed home, made the same meal for cheaper, and eaten at a real table."}
{"text":"#1: The pizzas are tiny, like the size of a pizza you order at the movie theatre.  $10+
#2:  The meat on the Cubano panini was completely dried out, and all I could taste were the mustard and pickles.  $10
#3:  The chocolate lava cake is good, but $8 for a home-made cupcake size dessert?  Overall:  Meh."}
{"text":"Modern Grove recently opened in the neighborhood. Recommend this place for a chill night out with the guys. Servers have always been very helpful and quick. Burger was a little overcooked but they re-made a burger with no problem.

Highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"I always pass by this place on the way home from work and since I had no clue what to eat for dinner, I popped in! The woman behind the counter, whom I assume was also the manager, greeted me and I told her it was my first time there. She gave me a menu but told me that there was a special going on for the Mesa location's anniversary... Cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $7. Sold! 
I waited not even 10 minutes while I perused their small market section, and my food was done. I didn't ask the burger to be cooked in any specific way. I just went with the flow. I tasted the fries first... Score!! Delicious and not too crispy or soft. Just perfect. Burger was next. It was very good. :) 
I will come back to check out the other items in the menu and the patio as well. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  It definitely helps revitalize the intersection at Tatum and Greenway.  The restaurant itself is really cute and lives up to its vibe of being a modern neighborhood eatery.  Love the outdoor space with the outdoor bar and the cornhole boards.

I got the gobbler (turkey burger) which was pretty solid as far as turkey burgers go.  The toppings were generous (there was half an avocado on top -- yum).  The portions are pretty good for the price and the fries are delicious.  

We went during lunch rush hour and while it was busy we didn't feel like our service was sacrificed.  Our food came out pretty much immediately after we had sat down.  Parking can be really busy (we had to park all the way down at Walgreen's).  

The one thing -- and this is an odd complaint -- is that there weren't any napkin dispensers anywhere.  All of the silverware came wrapped in a napkin but when my hubby spilled his coffee we had no choice but to grab three or four silverware sets just to use the napkins."}
{"text":"4/7/14:  food is still good, but again, service is a disorganized mess.  Server appeared before our butts were in the chairs, so we rushed to figure out what we wanted to drink.  They were out of two of the five beers on tap, but husband ordered one of the remaining three and I asked about the wines, and she knew nothing about them. I rolled the dice and ordered the red blend. 

She returned quickly with waters for us, and then we placed our order:  pretzel sticks appetizer to share, Italian chopped salad and hail kale salad for me.

A few minutes go by and ALL of the food arrived, but we still had no beer or wine.  Thankfully the person who delivered our food went and grabbed our drinks from the bar for our server.

Pretzel sticks were ok.  Better than most, but not as good as the pretzels from Haus Murphy, which is expected. Warm, light, fluffy, but blandish and not much salt.

Kale salad was good.  Baby kale leaves, crunchy pistachios, mandarin oranges, cranberries, and vinaigrette, which was lightly flavored and tasty.

Husband said Italian chop salad was \"ok\"...wasn't bad, wasn't great.  Note: if you order this, your meat is sparse and on the bottom.

Ordered cheesecake for dessert when I started to update this review, still hadn't arrived...and I'm a slow phone typist.

Still hopeful they get their ducks in a row--it's a great concept, just poorly orchestrated at this point."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, good food. 

The burgers are great, from presentation to taste I have zero complaints. 

It's mildly noisy on the patio with Tatum Blvd right there but the ambiance is great and it's in the shade (keep in mind for summers). 

When were recommended a blueberry cookie, ice cream dessert and tried it. Absolutely amazing. Prices were very reasonable, so all around I can highly suggest this place and will return for sure."}
{"text":"OK went back to grab a pastry
In brief, took forever to get served at the counter and the cherry croissant was raw dough in the middle, threw it away.
Would have asked for a refund but was miles away already when I bit into it
UGH

Do not waste your money here..."}
{"text":"I want to love this place especially since it is in my  neighborhood. I have tried it twice and the food is just not good. It's bland, has no flavor and has nothing special to it. When I go out to eat I want the food to look better than if I made it at home. Modern Grove doesn't do that. Hopefully they will get it together because the atmosphere is really nice inside. No plans to go back anytime soon, there are too many other places near by that are a lot better."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try a new place and we we were disappointed-took the waitress 15 min to ask if we wanted water and another-5 minutes to come back and take our order. My husband ordered one of their flat bread pizzas and it was good. I ordered the salmon Pattie and it was horrible! There was no flavor and it was a pile of mush-yuk"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a second chance as it is super cute inside HOWEVER it was again disappointing. Last time I was there the service was extremely slow and our food was served cold, I thought it was due to them just opening. This time as we came in on a Sunday afternoon (over a year later) and we were greeted with someone saying we are really busy and don't have a bartender on working so it will take a while to get drinks. Could you go up front and order your food also. As there were a great number of tables open I did not see how they could be so understaffed. Way to set it up for another horrible experience. I don't see a third chance coming their way."}
{"text":"Oh Modern Grove, you were so pretty - yes, you turned my head and I was draw into your inner sanctum - once again, so lovely - a delightful place to hang out and have a beer - like a little section of hipster Santa Monica brought into the desert - as a bar, I would give you 4 stars, but as a restaurant, I'm sorry to say, all style and not much substance.

More specifically, I ordered the white sauce pizza with the cured ham and the arugula - it sounded good but as I sat down with my glass of green iced tea (I do like the iced tea selection, and they have iced coffee) I read the reviews and fear entered my little foodie heart - things like bland crust and I was thinking - but surely, a place as nice as this realizes what a pizza town this is and would have a light crispy crust...but no, oh my fellow yelpers, if only I had checked with you before ordered...the crust, yes the crust, was doughy and bland. I wouldn't say it was horrible but it seems like it could easily be so much better  - and when I did get the pizza, it just seemed odd that the pizza was cut, and then the proscuitto was layered across it - not the easiest to eat as the meats do not align with the slices - may I suggest putting the ham on and baking it with the pizza and then adding on the arugla and drizzling with olive oil and a little fresh cracked pepper and some shaved parm? I've had this sort of pizza in a number of places and I just think it could be brought up a bit in presentation to do justice to the ingredients.

Beautiful place - would love to hang out here with friends over drinks - just need the quality of the food to be as good as the design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. In the evenings it turns into more of a waiter serviced style restaurant. In the afternoons you order at the register."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening. We sat outside, which was real cute with artificial grass and plenty of seating. The service was acceptable. I ordered the quinoa and my husband ordered a panani. It was tasty, but it was a little costly for the potion size. I'm not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"This place had potential too! Bummer. The decor is lovely, but the service is AWFUL. We ordered dinner and drinks...WE ended up having to go up to the bar ourselves to get the drinks after waiting 15 minutes. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, and my bruschetta came out totally wrong. They have a pick 3...and the server brought out 1 out of the 3 I ordered. My husband ordered a burger and it was just ok.

I wish they would have executed the service, because it really is a cute place. Definitely will not be returning to Modern Grove."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great look and at noon as another reviewer stated rather empty and I know why.   I had high hopes that we found a nice place to have lunch ordered the chicken salad with feta cheese and asked for avocado on top.   The greens where old and wilted, you know how you have salad in your refrigerator to long and it starts to look bad , that is it right there.  No hiding bad salad it stands out like a sore thumb.  Sent it back and had to wait another ten min. for a new salad, this time with avocado on top.  They said they opened a new bag but it looked the same just more salad with a lot more dressing.  At this point No Lunch for Me, had to take a few bites of my husband burger (dry) the highlight was the sweet potato fries where good.  

The waitress was pissed off and just took my salad it not offer to get me anything I ended up going to Taco Bell and eating at my desk.  That is an hour out of my life that I will never get back."}
{"text":"Lunch for 2: shared Strawberry Salad and Chicken Panini.
Brown edged lettuce. 
Dirty Silverware. 
Replacement salad was no better.
Strawberry Salad dressing was tasty, chicken seemed processed.
Chicken Panini was eh.
Sweet potato fries were nice.
Only one size of fountain drink - not enough for a hot day in Phoenix.
Fountain drink was refillable."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been talking about trying out Modern Grove for months now and decided tonight was the night. We were seated outside right away, and took a look at the menu. We decided what we wanted to drink, then on an appetizer, then on our meal. The whole time, no one came by to greet us or take our drink order. After about ten minutes we started to try to make eye contact with the numerous staff that was ambling about, to no avail. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. At the table next to us, the server came by three times in the 20+ minutes we sat before giving up and leaving. We were really hoping to find a new neighborhood restaurant to visit on those nights we want to go out and are disappointed in our experience. I doubt we'll go back again."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this new place and finally got my chance tonight.  We've driven by numerous times since they opened last spring but the crowds always kept us away.  Monday night was quiet and easy to get in.  Unfortunately we just missed Happy Hour (3-6pm) but looks like they have a nice offering with a reduction of price on many tempting appetizers & drinks.  I saw some mighty tasty looking appetizers passing by and I look forward to trying the bruschetta board on a future visit.

We both had sandwiches - I tried the Capri with mozzarella, prosciutto, pesto & roasted peppers on thick sliced honey wheat bread.  There was an insane amount of prosciutto and half a sandwich was more than enough for me.  He had the turkey & cheddar Panini and French fries, neatly consumed and thoroughly enjoyed.  

I liked the atmosphere of this place, kind of hipster but relaxed & comfortable.  In cooler weather it would be nice to dine on their ample patio.  I appreciated the bottle of chilled water promptly delivered when we sat down.  We did not find noise to be a problem here and the server was excellent, all the way from the friendly hostess to our very efficient waiter.    

I noticed quite a few takeout orders being placed and/or picked up.  On Tuesdays they offer $5.99 dinner-plate sized pizza w/ purchase of a beverage.  Yup, I'm already looking at my calendar and planning my return visit."}
{"text":"Modern Grove has all the makings of a great restaurant. It really reminded me of one of Sam Fox's restaurants, like True Food or something. So adorable inside and out. But that just did not make up for the poor quality food. The bruschetta was pretty good, we got the tomato, pesto and salami, and roasted peppers and goat cheese. I liked the latter 2, but the tomato was...meh. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Like other readers, I found the chicken to taste weird. I asked the server where it was cooked (suspected it was a fully cooked frozen patty when they purchased it), and after avoiding me for about 10 mins, I asked again, and she said her cook was on break and she'd have the answer soon. Answer was that they overnight the chicken, and she overemphasized that they keep it in the refrigerator until they use it, or they freeze it before it goes bad. Well whoop de do! Good for you, MG! You refrigerate your meat!! Anyway, things were just not good, and it seems like they cut corners in a lot of places by buying pre-made food items and not really cooking anything from scratch. My husband got the BBQ cheddar burger and the bun was huge but the burger patty was itty bitty. Just because you have a huge bun doesn't fool me on the actual burger size!  Although the fries were tasty :). So overall very disappointed. Don't let Modern Grove fool you into thinking they are fresh or healthy."}
{"text":"This place was all right. Other reviews likened their first impression of Modern Grove to a \"second tier Fox concept,\" and now that I've spent a meal there I pretty much agree.

We came here for a late-ish (1:45 - 2:00) lunch on a sunny (and windy!) Saturday. I was surprised that pretty much all the lawn tables and seating were full, given how gusty it was outside. The big garage-door window wall was up and there is tons of natural light in the space, so we got to have some of the effects of outdoor seating without my hair turning into a nest and our napkins flying around. Score! Another score: didn't have to worry about being bombarded by one of the many children flinging beanbags at each other and running around the front door. Hey, their parents were too busy drinking beer to keep their kids in check. Give them a break. *eyeroll*

Service at lunch time was order at the counter, fill your own drink, take your number to the table style. I appreciated that the girl at the \"host\" station asked each incoming party if they'd been there before (most had not) and explained the set up. It's just nice.

We ordered the hummus to share, while I took the veggie panini and boyfriend opted for the turkey burger. The hummus and my sandwich came out at the same time; turkey burger took about 5 more minutes. Not a huge deal, since boyfriend was in the process of ordering us drinks at the bar and the amount of time he waited for those two drinks took laughably long. There was a guy at behind the bar with his back to the inside room, reading over some notebook/menu who WOULD NOT turn around. Finally another girl came over and took his order for a beer and mimosa. Again, it took FOREVER for her to give him the tab and then pick up his card and run it. Maybe she was in the weeds, but it really wasn't that busy?

Onto the important stuff: FOOD. The hummus was delish, and I liked the pita crackers it was served with. I really enjoyed the feta/olive/herb oil melange poured on top of the hummus. Veggie panini was standard. I really loved the grilly flavor of the veggies, I just wish they would think outside the box. All I could discern was grilled onions, zucchini and red peppers, with the same standard-blah balsamic glaze. Mix it up! I got a fruit cup for my side, which was a typical mix. (Grapes, pineapple, melons)

Boyfriend said his turkey burger was one of the best he'd ever had, and it looked great. There was a good portion of avocado on top of the patty, none of this \"here's a microscopic sliver of avo for $1.00\" business to be found. His fries were thin and seasoned. Great!

I found out my boss had tried this place for dinner and had a disastrous wait time. Between her experience and many reviews on Yelp, I think our future game plan for Modern Grove will be: 1) stick to an \"off\" time, 2) try a different vegetarian option (the pizzas looked pretty dang good; the bruschetta assortment looked a little wimpy for $10) 3) attempt to kidnap a child and see how far away I can get before their drinking parents notice. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Great to see a restaurant like this pop up in this neighborhood after 20 years of living right near this corner! Service is great, and food is reasonably priced and very tasty. My only request is that I would like to see more breakfast options. Great, chic atmosphere w/ outside seating, which is great for those sub-110 degree Phoenix days!"}
{"text":"It looks like a terrific place to eat and all.. But the food is so plain and it doesn't have a taste to it. It's way over price for the quality of it. I could of ate somewhere better. First and last time I will be going there!"}
{"text":"Has to be the worst service EVER!!! The only reason I left one star is because it's the only way I can post this review. Took half an hour to get our drinks and over an hour to get our food. Once we got our food my husbands fries was cold and they forgot my pizza which took another 10-15 minutes.  Truly a waste of time. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the facility has never looked better! If you haven't been in lately, you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Service not great!!!  We came at noon on a Sunday thinking it would be busy and we may need to wait a little while. However it was not busy at all. There were 5 tables including ours outside while we were dining. There were two waitresses between these tables so it should be doable!  We waited for drink refills and our check for 10 minutes. I ordered a basic salad and it came drenched in dressing. My daughters ordered a white pizza which was awesome. If you have a lot of time come here. If you have other things to do I would avoid this place at all cost. 
The patio is the reason we came. Pet friendly and grassy. Was nice sitting outside today since it wasn't hot and there was a breeze but we didn't plan on staying for an hour and a half."}
{"text":"I was really excited. I woke up this morning with all the tell-tale signs of illness (the scratchy throat, stuffy nose, sinus pressure, etc.) that hearken a really tough day of work ahead. My fiancee, who is blessedly off today and willing to take me to lunch, picks me up and we go browsing around Tatum. I see this really cute shop, and that deep-bellied hunger for soup arises. Being the adventurous type into discovering new joints to frequent, I select Modern Grove. The sandwich menu, while pricey, looks DELICIOUS - and maybe better suited for a date night. I want SOUP! My throat wants it, my body wants it. I NEED IT. 

Not only that - they have one of my favorite soups, and I can actually have it since it doesn't have chicken broth!!! YAY!!! (Thank you to the woman passing through the kitchen who answered my question and put up with me clarifying for sure that it was vegetarian! I appreciate it! :) ) The girl at the register didn't seem to have much patience for me, and wasn't responsive when I tried to make conversation or when I smiled at her. She just kind of stared at me like she wanted me to get out of line so she could go back to...not having a line, because honestly the place wasn't very busy (and no one stood behind me the entire time). Typical lunch hour traffic. So, a less than friendly welcome - alright. I got my fiancee and I both a BOWL of soup, which is 6.49 each - and with a $3 tip (which is a little more than 18% of the total bill for something that I haven't even tried) - it ends up being a little over $17. Well, for something that is technically To-Go and probably just being ladled and then handed to me, I think that's not a terrible tip. 

Well, after waiting a few minutes - not unreasonable - she walks out and unceremoniously drops the bag on my table, snatches the number plaque that indicates what order we are, and then briskly walks away. That's it. That's how I received my food. Alright. We aren't really thrilled by the service, but we finally (and quietly - no complaint from us, no farewell from them) left with soup in hand. When I finally reached our car and retrieved mine from its paper bag prison, thoroughly prepared to indulge myself, I found two small, half filled bowls that each fit in the palm of my hand and two packages of saltine crackers for each. The soup itself wasn't bad - I mean, it was pretty good soup, but there was barely any of it and it had practically been tossed at me. In the end, I didn't enjoy it because the entire experience (on top of the size) kind of ruined it for me. 

The atmosphere of the building is great! I really loved how it looked, I really liked the setup, and the descriptions for the food were mouth-watering. Bottom-line for me is this: I am polite. I am courteous. I will be engaging, and if the server does not return the favor - I don't try to cause a scene or publicly punish them for it. I also, like most people, work hard and pay bills, and when I am looking to treat myself I want to have a satisfactory experience - and food that is at least worth it in quality and quantity to what I am paying. $6.49 is reasonable if you actually get more than seven spoonfuls (their spoon, not mine!) of the product (I am afraid to see what the cup of soup would be for two dollars less). At the end of it all, I was still hungry - and I just felt like crap. Based on the reviews, I guess this is not an uncommon occurrence. I wish them well, but I don't think I will be back. It just isn't worth it to me if I am going to be treated like a nuisance and then receive a meager portion of food. ): This is my first YELP review, and I am using it to express discontent. That just furthers my disappointment.

Have a wonderful New Year."}
{"text":"If you want to spend 51 dollars for 2 mediocre hamburgers, 2 drinks and a kids meal, be my guest.  Should have gone to 5 guys up the street."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their chicken salad and sweet fries.  Their chef with the beard is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but food was not good. Ordered the chicken panini sandwich and it had zero flavor and chicken was dry. Had the potato salad as a side and it tasted off. Also had the hot chocolate and it tasted like it was from a packet. Sad because this place it very cute and in a great location but is way overpriced and the food is lousy."}
{"text":"I've been to Modern Grove many times and will go back. I love the atmosphere! Great patio and am able to bring my dog. Absolutely LOVE the kale salad and mac & cheese bites. Great selection of beer and wines. As for the service, it has always been great and the server has never messed up our order. The only reason I am giving in 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. A kale salad with added chicken is almost $20. If it wasn't for the price, I would be going a lot more. Highly recommend it though!"}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere!  Great vodka club soda!  Best french fries anywhere in town.  And, the blue cheese wedge chopped salad is the best I have ever had!  Yum!  I eat every bite of it!"}
{"text":"I have not had a chance to personally try this place....YET. But the Director of Operations is going to take this place far. He's a great leader. :) cheers !"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes.  The patio is fantastic.  The interior is gorgeous and hip and to the other extreme the food is so boring and tasteless.  My pizza (I posted a pic) prosciutto arugula, the crust was bland and looked parbaked.  Table was dirty.  Staff appeared to be annoyed by patrons.  We ordered cheesecake and was told it comes with a cranberry sauce on top.  In actuality it's blueberries.  Also the dessert took between 15-20 minutes for it to arrive...  For cheesecake.  Huh?  I think it was defrosting.  Who knows.  I don't have any plans returning for lunch or dinner.  Maybe the breakfast would be a better choice.  We shall see...."}
{"text":"Great spot for the area. Comfy and warm with a great patio and good energy. The food was fine. Pizza could have been warmer and the mac and cheese balls were a little bland although the dipping sauce was yummy. The issue here is service. It is very slow and not very attentive. I had to ask a busser for an iced tea refill. Once the food was delivered we never saw our server again until it was time for the check. We were asked 3 times by three different people if we would like our dishes cleared said yes please all 3 times but none of them ever cleared them. Odd."}
{"text":"When this place opened last year I was so excited to try this place. The neighborhood community restaurant is an awesome idea! I must say that I have eaten here at least a dozen times and am always drawn back to one thing on the menu...rise and shine breakfast which is 2 eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon. I have tried the panini, salad, pizza and burgers and have been disappointed in all except the breakfast. The service needs help too. Every time I have placed an order the food takes forever to get done and usually something is wrong with the order. There is lots of potential for this place if they added more choices to their menu and provided better service. I would love to give this place more than just 3 stars, but a lot needs to change with management and service before that can happen."}
{"text":"We ate there last night. We had the \"gluten friendly\" free Bianca Pizza, it was very good. We loved the atmosphere, the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be returning. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I hate to bash a place that I want to succeed, but after 3 visits this will be my last.   All three times my wife and I visited we never received our appetizers.  The first time we chalked it up as a new spot, but the next 2 times we chalked it up as just bad service and a confused staff.   We also received our dinner plates separately which is just ridiculous.   I see from other reviews we aren't the only ones experiencing the poor service.  I hope it changes as I like the location and feel of the place, but can't recommend at this time."}
{"text":"Found a shard of sharp rigid plastic in my toast on the first bite- fortunately, it was in mine and not my wife's or my 84 year old Aunt who was with us..  Told mgmt.- shoulder length female mgr, she said \"that's not right, let me tell the owners...\" That was it.. I never saw her again.. except cleaning a table and smiling/chatting with coworkers- and she smiled and looked right at me when I left and thanked me for coming-slow morning.. 12 people in store total..everyone doing cleaning and stocking items..I'm pretty easy going..things happen..no harm came to me, and I still frequent the place- I finished my meal including the same piece of toast, with another small plastic \"crunchie\"... And not that I was searching for or expecting a freebie.. BUT.. seriously?  Not even a \"sorry about that, let us get your breakfast\" or how about the beverages? Maybe a \"your next meal is on us\"... The Modern Grove seriously needs to train management...everything else was great!  Added picture of shard to Modern Grove's pix-this review would not be here had I felt more cared for, and had this issue been given the attention it truly deserved- what if this was a child's piece of toast? What else goes into the food that they miss??!?"}
{"text":"I like this place for a quiet lunch or a nice afternoon drink.  Really nice, open restaurant with great interior space and patio.  The menu is above average (but not great) and a little pricey for what it is.  That being said, I like this place and have recommended it to many people."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is the only thing that was good. The service was super slow and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Basics: trying too hard to be hip, overpriced, bad food. Not only does it taste bland, the burger was over done and there was a hair in my chicken sandwich. Staff is apathetic and quick to hand you off to someone else if you have a complaint. The manager was nice enough, and substituted the food, which is why I gave 2 stars. Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"The best salad choices are gone and the ice tea is not very good, way too strong and lacking subtle notes. However, sitting outside on a lovely day I'm hoping the fried zucchini will redeem our afternoon tea. We've never had a mean here, but they are offering fried chicken so maybe."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside and enjoy an Arizona fall evening. And, they wait on you outside vs the counter service inside. We had the Turkey Gobbler - very mediocre and the veggie panini - about the same. I'd say it was better than some of the previous reviews made it sound. Not sure we'll rush back but really, not so bad."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Atmosphere is great, menu looks good and it's very close for me. The food just isn't good. I've been here 4 times and always tried different things and it's just not very good. Last time I went here, I was one of the only people in the restaurant, there were 6 people behind the counter and it took several minutes for any of them to even great me."}
{"text":"If I had kids, I'd probably come here all the time. Astro turf, corn hole, sidewalk chalk and puppies. Lots of puppies! 

The food is just fine. Grab a tall pint of cold beer, soak in the sun, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool mixture of outside artificial grass patio, free standing fireplace and streaming overhead lights at night.  Inside seating,  small store area, a bakery and bar. It's pleasant at night in good weather.  I've been here 4 times since it opened.  Bakery/Pastry very bland.  Service a bit slow.  Food lacks flavor. I might come back for a drink outside with a friend, not to eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a third time.  Cold breakfest buritto.  Then BLT with only 2 small pieces of bacon.  I hope they can get it together beause it is a cool place.  The nice waitress did make it better, by making another BLT for me herself.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Modern Grove looks better than it tastes. Pretty blan. Had the mushroom and swiss burger for $10 and it was meat, Mushrooms cheese, no onions And the seating / table process is confusing. They have a hostess stand that says please wait to be seated but yet as you wait everyone else comes in cafeteria style and sits down.  Would have been nice for the 5 employees who passed me standing aimlessly at their hostess stand to ask me if I needed anything.  Oh well, I'm in no hurry back."}
{"text":"When weather allows seating on the patio, Modern Grove is perhaps a four star destination. Bring the pup. Feel the artificial turf between your toes. Play some corn hole. Enjoy the food and drink.

But when the food has to stand on its own, Modern Grove falls short. On this day we ordered a pizza (bland), a hamburger (fine), and a sandwich (I forget). No complaints, really, but nothing was as tasty as described on the menu. Or even as tasty as it looked. Add slow service to the mix and well, I think you needed to be enjoying alcohol from the bar to have a good experience. Not us on this day.

I do like the modern industrial feel of the place. Nicely done. And the menu is quite varied. Something for everyone. 

I will return, but not until the weather cools down and I can enjoy the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We came looking for fresh and fabulous!  We found fresh & 'almost' fabulous. The customer service is top notch! We were greeted by a sweet young lady and served by another sweety, Sam! The manager Ian, was spectacular when summoned to come to our table when our special of the night was tough and tasteless. He was sad to hear this but very appreciative to know the special didn't live up to it's name. He more than took care of us by buying my meal, (I didn't want it replaced) and treating us to dessert. We promised to return for round two the next night and we did. We thoroughly enjoyed the Napa pizza, our Italian chopped salad and the Gobbler, their signature homemade turkey burger. Our only critique after the second night being 'FABULOUS', is to season things more. I had to ask for salt & pepper when I don't like too much salt.  The turkey burger and seasoned fries really needed it. I overheard the table behind us say her food was good, but bland. Not sure what she ordered. Overall?  This is a GREAT FRESH FOOD place with an eclectic menu & a fun, relaxed atmosphere and attentive staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to see a trendy and family friendly restaurant pop up near our neighborhood we couldn't wait to try! We gushed over the decor for the entire time it took to get our wine (15 mins) which was sub par and room temperature. The menu was good, but only if you were on a \"cheat day\".  We ordered the only 3 healthy options on the menu and were VERY disappointed. The hummus app was the smallest portion of hummus we've ever encountered, but the stale pita chips were enough for a portion 10x the size.  My Caprese salad didn't feel fresh and his garden salad was blah.  Again we pondered, \"maybe we ordered wrong\" but come on, you shouldn't have ANYTHING on your menu if you don\"t stand behind it.  It was so disappointing that WE WENT TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT  AFTER ON A WORK DAY THAT CRAZY!!!    This place makes me soooooo sad because its the first trendy thing within 7 miles of our house! PLEASE PLAESE FIX THIS WE WILL BE REGULARS!"}
{"text":"First timers. Everyone is talking about this place. We had to try it.

Absolutely exceptional customer service. Tina was so accommodating and willing to do what made my sister happy.. She had order the Cubano Panino, not realizing that there's massive mustard in the sandwich. Tina took it back with no hesitation,  gave her another sandwich with no mustard., not only that, she also put sweeet potato fries on the side for her on the house!! 

I ordered the Grove, vegetarian of course. It was okay. Not bad not good. The sweet potato is really good :)

I drove far for this.. I would come back :)"}
{"text":"We've been back multiple times and have liked everything we've tried. There also must have recently been a change in staffing as we've seen many new faces and noticed a positive improvement in speed which was really the only downfall we saw to the place."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would.  We have been there a few times but the last two have been a terrible experience. The only reason we went back this last time was because we assumed they were busy and couldn't handle it the time before.  Fine - give them a break.   Nope!  They weren't busy at all and it still took an hour to get ONE pizza and an appetizer of bruschetta.  Our waitress outright ignored our table and when we asked about our order, she said they had one oven and the pizza and bruschetta couldn't be cooked at the same time.  WHAT?  You can seat 50 people and have onovas.  B/S. And instead of owning up to the bad service and comping something, we were again irngored and thrown the bill.  The pizza came out cold and the bruschetta never made it out.  We had to ask for it to go. We will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Decent food. Average waiter. Great atmosphere. Good music. Love the open room And outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Service and execution need help. On our third visit to modern grove the kitchen was a disaster. Sandwiches came out looking beautiful until you turned it over to discover the bottom was black. Asked for a replacement grilled cheese which they graciously supplied. Unfortunately, the cheese was not melted?

For a group of six, kitchen sent out 2 meals, several minutes later came next 3 meals. Last person was served 10 minutes later than the rest of the party. Steak sandwich was served rare not by request. 

Embarrassing that service is so hit or miss. Get your act together and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. Honestly my favorite thing to do here in have some mimosas in the morning on the weekends. I feel like food is so hit or miss... And usually it's a miss. 

I've had a couple of their panini's and they have all been super dry. Like its missing some sauce or something. 

The hummus and veggie appetizer is total waste of money. $10 for the TINIEST blob of hummus and way too many veggies.

I had the chicken and strawberry salad a few weeks ago and it was delicious. I've seriously been craving it since. I went back today with my brother and it wasn't even the same!! It had NO goat cheese (my favorite part), the tiniest smallest morsels of chicken, and like 4 strawberry slivers. Look if I'm paying $11 for a freaking salad at least be consistent with it and don't chince out on the good ingredients. 

To make it worse my brother went in and asked for some goat cheese to put on it since it was left off, and they literally gave me a glob of it in a bowl. Wasn't even crumbled so I could put it on the salad. 

You wait forever for your food and appetizers usually NEVER come out before the entree. 

I won't be returning any longer. This place looks way better than any experience you will have here. Bland, inconsistent, overpriced food."}
{"text":"The macaroni balls are bland.  My chopped salad was closer to Minced. The service is good and the atmosphere is nice.  Neat place, just needs more flavor in the food."}
{"text":"I went for lunch I will not return for lunch but will try for dinner the menu is the same but I'm hoping experience will be much different . First off I'm not a fan of the concept of the restaurant being cafe style during day & sit down at night, it would make since if the menu was different durning day  but for how hot food is prepared I don't want a paradise bakery experience on walking up to order and then going to counter to pick up it was a bit of a disaster. Service is in great need of getting things to run smoothly here but it is a new restaurant so I'm sure it will get worked out . The food was ok nothing great but I would go back for convenience  of being close to hm , I do love the decor and urban vibe atmosphere the patio dining is really fun & cute! Reasonably priced menu options and kid friendly I will go back to try the dinner experience but for now it I would only give it 2.5/3 stars will update again after dinner experience"}
{"text":"Modern Grove! Aside from the fact my 1st born happens 2 work here- I'm biased about the service which truly is always excellent. The management and staff is friendly, hard working, knowledgeable about the menu and shows enthusiasm for the venues up and coming business growth! Modern Grove partners with local vendors and is in the midst of a large co-op partnership with an international eco- environmental concept soon to be. The vision of what is to be for Modern Grove lends to the current atmosphere at the Tatum and Greenway location- upbeat and energized- just what Good ol' Arizona needs! You can expect a trendy yet family friendly, indoor/outdoor seating and bar area. They are dog friendly and have corn hole on the green under twinkle patio lights and tables with umbrellas and misters. This location hits the spot for a biz. lunch or mom/daughter or bro date. Menu= Beer on tap, refreshing cocktails like the #ElectricLemonade or a not so basic BloodyMary, Fresh coffee, teas, & soda. The menu is diverse with panini to kale salads and my fav. the bruschetta board. Of course there's a kids menu and appetizers that are more of the comfort food to organic choice. Don't skip desert (cookies- fresh pastries, made in house.) #SupportLocalBiz & try it. P.S. They specialize in catering!!!"}
{"text":"Solid, solid food! Great prices! The Mac and cheese bites ROCKED!!!!!! Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"When Modern Grove first opened, it was great- fresh healthy food with a twist at reasonable prices. Not anymore.  The last two times the service was so bad that i was ready to leave. Were they waiting for the vegetables to grow? They weren't short handed. They were disorganized.  The food is so disappointing now. I go there with my step daughter,  so i dont care about the bar. The tomatoes in our salad weren't ripe and had no taste. The carrot sticks for our hummus was rubbery. They stopped having fresh food, so i don't go there. Better salads at Wendy's."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Fresh & creative and priced right.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Service was a bit spotty here, but eventually we got our food and drinks.   They have a very cool outdoor patio here.  Food was okay.  The steak sandwich was very chewy, but the fried mac and cheese balls were delicious.  The biggest thing that stands out to me here is how bright it is inside.  Turn the lights down a bit.  Also, there are a lot of little kids here for what you would think is a more adult oriented resataurant."}
{"text":"I'm rooting for this neighborhood restaurant, but they really need to work on their customer service. The atmosphere is great, very cute and so far, after 3 visits, I can only say the food is just okay.  I would and want to continue to come back, but their service is NOT good. They really need to work on improving. C'mon, step it up! We want you to stay in business!!"}
{"text":"Ok if you want a quick, inexpensive meal and are ok with bad service.  On multiple occasions I ordered a salad which took almost 30 minutes (the wedge).  On 2 occasions they \"lost the ticket\" on the food and didn't take the initiative to consider it belonged to a table.  What do you expect when you're being served by high school students and 19 yr olds serving beer?  I'd rather pay more for good service.

I've been here about a dozen times at all times of the day .. Service has been bad every single time.  The wifi doesn't work, and has never worked, and the waiters and bartenders have no customer service skills.  I honestly don't know why I keep coming back other than it's close to my house."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place various times and thought I would give it a try for lunch.  Inside very welcoming, ceiling to wall windows, plenty of seating.  What stuck out was the smiles.  Smiles at the counter, smiles at the open kitchen.  I ordered a Italian Cobb salad(added chicken) and an ice tea.  Salad was big and very good.  perfect lunch on the go.  I will definitely return as I work in the area."}
{"text":"Updated:  6-1-14

I will update this review after/we return.  First bad sign was at the register.  The girl taking our order was ok but not exactly customer service oriented or friendly.  We ordered 3 appetizers so we could try a few different. 

Finally after 25 minutes 1 of the appetizers showed up (Mac n cheese balls). They were pretty good. Not amazing but good. About 5 minutes later our kale salad arrived.  I will say that the kale salad was fantastic. If I return again I'll order it for sure.  We were told our 3rd item (pretzels)  was going to be \"right out\". Well 20 minutes later (55 minutes total) they still haven't been delivered, no one has checked on us and our daughter is done sitting still so it's time go. 

I understand things happen in a restaurant but if you can't a soft pretzel taken care of in under an hour after you've been fully aware that there was an issue with this order 25 minutes in then you've got serious problems.  

We really wanted to like this place.  It's got great outdoor seating and is right around the corner from my house.  Not sure yet if I'll give them another chance.  If I do. I'll update this review.


Update : went back a 2nd time and had an equally disappointing experience.  We want to like this place but I can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"Great burger, great pizza, great service. Had an issue initially but they made up. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it. The food just wasn't  that good. The quality may be there, the idea is good but it just misses the mark. Cute place though."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Drove by so many times. Very happy we finally went in for dinner.
We will be coming back for sure. Very fresh, tastey, and healthy."}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this new place. We unfortunately left far disappointed. Came in around 7:30. Only one customer and quiet atmosphere. I find it very odd that employees were doing a full cleaning well into open hours. There were brooms and dustpans everywhere. We've been sitting for an hour and dirty dish towels have sat on the drink counter each time I went to fill my coffee. My chorizo sandwich was less than desirable. The bread was cut so bad there practically wasn't a \"top\" to my sandwich. The breakfast burrito was served with no salsa- when we asked for some it was rather sweet. Being that we were the only other customer, I'm disappointed it took so long to get our food. Though the experience wasn't too great I might give this place another try in a month. Hopefully they can work out the kinks and focus on customer care/appearance."}
{"text":"First time visiting Modern Groove today for lunch. Ordered the Italian sandwich, only had to wait a few minutes.  Walking in made me think there should have been someone at the front I wasn't sure if we were suppose to grab a table or walk straight up to the counter.  Great location the out side patio and bar both look fun!  Sit outside or on the patio after work for a glass if wine!"}
{"text":"I tried out this place for lunch since it's near my job. It's super cute on the outside and in. During lunch, you order at the counter. The staff at the counter were nice. I had ordered myself the caprese salad and ice tea. They have 3 different kind of teas to try out. I went for the peach tea. My caprese salad was alright. I kinda wish it wasn't the balsamic glaze was drizzled on just the food and not over the plate. That's why I won't give 5 stars to this place. Every time I placed my fork down on my plate, it would get covered in balsamic drizzle. If I were to order this dish again, I would omit the prosciutto as well because it tasted a little funny. I'm not saying it was a bad dish, the tomatoes and basil were fresh and the mozzarella was delicious. I just would have liked a cleaner plate."}
{"text":"Very good little place to have lunch! Want to go back and sit at the bar sometime and check out the night scene for sure."}
{"text":"I came with an open mind about this place despite the other reviews. They have a kids menu, which earns them an instant star! My 6 yr old enjoyed her cheese quesadilla (they happily modified the chicken quesadilla) and fries. The green tea is really good. The cauliflower quinoa salad (side) is interesting - like a whole foods salad. The margherita pizza was covered in beefsteak tomatoes and sauce. The mozzarella was good and lots of fresh basil. Not greasy at all and we both loved the crust (possible improvement since last reviewer are here?). Anyhow... Definitely not the best pizza I ever had. But, edible. I didn't take leftovers. Probably won't be back, but worth trying. It seems this would be a nice place to come have a glass of wine with a girlfriend after work (if I drank- ha!)."}
{"text":"I desperately want Modern Grove to succeed.  It's a perfect bike riding distance from my house. The decor is very modern, fun and fresh.  The outdoor seating is ample and fun with games and is even dog-friendly.  The place just oozes with potential. But after about six visits, they miss the mark EVERY time. This place will not survive on just looks alone. The food and service are the problem.  Our most recent visit was after a Sunday afternoon bike ride. We thought we would ride over for a drink and appetizer. I had to convince my husband to go there since he has already crossed it off the list after too many bad experiences.  Unfortunately they disappointed again.  It was around 3:30pm. There were about four tables occupied outside.  EVERY single other table outside (about 10?) were dirty. I mean really dirty, with dishes stacked up, food everywhere. It was a gross mess.  We sat down at the least dirty of the tables. It was too long before anyone came by with menus. She didn't even comment on the mess or offer to wipe down our table.  We made a comment to the bartender about the issues before leaving. 

Many of our friends in the area have had similar experiences and will not go back.  
I really hope the managers are reading the reviews and making changes. My friends and I would love to see this place pull it together. I know their restaurant in Flagstaff closed. I wonder if it was for the same issues."}
{"text":"Read some of the other reviews and I'm a bit surprised that my experience was a lot different than theirs. I understand that management has made some changes and a new menu will arrive shortly and they are very much aware things could improve. My wife and I met with several friends on Thursday night and had one of the best dining experiences We have had in Arizona this winter.The atmosphere might have been a four star but the food was clearly outstanding. We live in fountain Hills and will certainly make the long trek to the Modern Grove again. For those of you who May have had a bad experience I would strongly recommend giving it another go. Wish they would open up a location in Colorado"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this experience. We had the same experience as many others have already expanded on. Blah. The cafe itself is very cute and seemed clean. The server was very nice, but she had too many tables. There appeared to be two managers working who did a lot of walking around, but not a lot of helping. Our glasses sat empty until we literally flagged one of them down.
The food is way overpriced for what you get. We ordered the napa pizza with a gluten free crust. It was sad...very sad. Their crust choice is not very tasty. There was hardly any topping on it. It was supposed to have fig jam, carmelized onions, ham, and goat cheese. It basically tasted like a dry saltine with some jam on it. It was about a 7 inch crust and cost over $15. A picture would have explained a lot but I can't seem to remember to do that! First of all, they call their sandwiches paninis...but they weren't. The reuben looked like a normal reuben, but the meat was so bland. There was hardly any sauerkraut. But, I will give them kudos for using dressing. The potato salad may have been homemade, but tasted like pre-packaged. We had to send the fries back because they were cold and lifeless. Yuck. They only serve wine and beer. I really liked the look of the place, but with complacent managers milling around flirting with cougars, very bland poorly executed food, and very high prices, doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is paradise for parents! With the corn hole and sidewalk chalk to keep the kids entertained, parents can have a nice evening without having to worry about their kids running around. There are a lot of kids, so probably not a place for a couple looking for a quiet dinner. The food was good; we ordered the macaroni and cheese bites, which were a hit with everyone, the bacon cheese burger, which was simply amazing, and the chicken and mozzarella panini, which was just average. There was so many things in the menu we wanted to try, it was hard to narrow down. Looks like we'll have to come back!"}
{"text":"Really nice building and love the outdoor patio seating, but , service is bad. Took 45 minutes for two turkey burgers to arrive today. Others around us were waiting at hour for food. They had 2 servers and ONE cook for a busy Sunday afternoon. Really disappointing, we would love to return but not with this current management."}
{"text":"I'm giving you 4 stars because I want you to succeed. It is the coolest place in the area by far. However after eating here 3 times now the reality is that your food is just okay. It's not that fresh and its pretty heavy. Service is improving. You must improve your food."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing. This place looks like it's going to be good, great looking patio, cool interior, but there is no regard for the actual customer experience. 

Cornhole boards are set up right next to tables and parents let their children run wild--throwing the bags, climbing on the boards, and screaming like they are on a playground. It honestly felt like we were eating at a Chuckie Cheese. Even our spacey waitress mentioned how annoying the children were. I am generally annoyed that restaurants think it's ok to bring dogs on a patio where people are trying to get served food, but in this case the dogs were better behaved than the children.

The service was slow at best. We watched our server bring out four tables worth of food before remembering to bring out the waters we asked for. 

We ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the roast panini. The chicken salad was bland and almost unbearably dry. The roast panini was actually the highlight of the meal, but I have to wonder if it was just by comparison. 

Overall, I expect this place won't last, or will become a place only for parents who want to drink wine and ignore their kids that are ruining everyone else's good time. The food certainly wasn't worth another visit."}
{"text":"Very much like the decor of the restaurant and the energy that it provides with the patrons. The decor is very impressive and had the feel of the place to be. Also liked the outside seating on the artificial turf.

The staff is very accomodating and helpful. Nice new shopping plaza with parking and safe area at all times of the day. It is located on Tatum just North of Greenway on the West side of the street. The atmosphere inside is very loud so if you do sign language you will have a great conversation with your table.

We shared the pepperoni pizza and shroom burger. Both were good but did not stand out from any other place. 

With living within a mile of the restaurant will probably come back maybe for breakfast but from the first visit could have easily made this place a more frequent stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited when this opened in our neighborhood. Like other reviewers have said, it's beautiful inside and out. I was in last night to pick up take out and sat at the bar to have a glass of wine. The pizza and fries I got were truly awful, overcooked to the point of being burnt and tasteless. Nevertheless I was so taken by the patio and hacky sacks on the patio for our two kids that we came back tonight in the hopes of enjoying a glass of wine while they played. Wow. Very poor service and food was worse than last night. We were seated by the greeter and we asked to get some bags for the game of hacky sacks, she told us to ask at the bar as she walked away. Pizza is on thin cracker-like base and utterly tasteless.The beef panini was brought out with our appetisers which we specifically asked not to happen. We asked for it to be brought back and they offered to \"keep it under a warmer\" which I refused and asked for a fresh sandwich to be fired in about 20 mins. 4 mins later the same sandwich comes back out. And so on and so forth. Such a shame. We so wanted to love it . We would have been regulars due to the awesome patio for the kids. If you don't have food and service you don't have anything."}
{"text":"If you like waiting for absurd amounts of time for gross food this is your place. We came here with our baby and waited a total of an hour and 15 minutes to not receive our appetizer or my meal. The beers were good and waiter was nice. They brought us out the Mac and cheese bites as an apology for our wait and they were extremely bland AND there was no salt in sight. The horror!!!Our appetizer (which was caprese and should have been fast to make) never came. My husband's sandwich was okay and came at 45 minutes. While I waited... We finally gave up and they brought us our bill. I complained and the manager comped our meal and brought me the bruschetta to take home in the 9th hour. It was dry, small, unappetizing and I threw it away after picking at it. 

Recommendation to management- make better food and deliver on time. Your menu is original, ambiance and concept is good and the neighborhood needs your type of restaurant. Go to the vig, le grande orange, and Postinos- take notes and copy their recipes."}
