{"text":"This place is very cute and welcoming when you go in. The employees don't all speak English so there is a bit of a language barrier, their service is good but could be better. They didn't come around to offer us more sauce because the size of it was portioned so small or to offer to refill our water. The menu is English and Chinese but some parts of the menu don't have an English version so it's hard to understand what is offered. Their grill is VERY SMALL, so cooking the food was VERY SLOW. The food was good but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Heard from a friend this place was good, so my boyfriend and I went to check it out for Friday dinner. At 7:30 pm there was only one other table...  The waitresses are nice, I guess? But they speak in mando only. I never understood that.... I spoke to them in English and they speak Chinese back. I speak mando so it's fine but I really wonder why restaurants can't hire people that speak English.... It's not like this is some cheap cheap restaurant. They also come check up on us way too often... I like to way in peace and talk to my bf but they kept coming over like every 5 minutes. Maybe that people enjoy talking to the waitresses about their life, but I don't.... They're there to help with my experience, not be my BFF. Definitely very awkward experience for me.   Now food... So expensive! We got a couple meats and the portions are so tiny. Also got noodles which was also pretty small. I went in hungry and left hungry.... Despite spending over 40 for two people. Could've ate double and just be barely full.   The grill is really slow. Its not like Korean bbq where it's in the table. This is literally a little portable grill you bring camping with you. Not a great experience. I expected so much more...   Overall, the experience was underwhelming. I won't ever go back. Don't go if you're hungry and want to eat right away.   The plus is that everything looks new and super cute. The sauces are good but they're uncovered on the table.. Weird. Maybe dirty... But I didn't get sick, so that's good!"}
{"text":"Servers are very nice, but that's probably the only nice thing about this restaurant. The grill stove of this restaurant is the slowest Ive ever experienced in a BBQ style restaurant. It took more than 20min for us to grill beef tongue to the medium rare stage. For the 4 of us, we ordered only 4 types of meat, one soup, one pan cake, our bill was over 100. Not worth it at all, not going back ever again."}
{"text":"Location is pretty small but didn't have to wait too long for a Friday night dinner. Some servers knows limited English pretty much only knows mandarin. Got the set meal for 4 people was pretty filling. Meat are marinated and taste decent but not all meat are fresh, some where still frozen when it arrived at the table. Meat do cook slow on the table top electric grill.  A lot of condiment are store in container that has no lids....  Kobe beef is only available if you reserve. Servers are not honest, as server asked are you paying debit or visa then came back with the machine and said no we only take debit."}
{"text":"Not bad. Meat is very fresh but stove is too small to cook all food. Not very good for big group"}
{"text":"I read about Goen Yakiniku in a Toronto-based Japanese magazine. The owner of this place ran a similar restaurant in Tokyo before starting a yakiniku place in Toronto (technically Markham).  In a strip mall, there's free parking (even an underground lot) so it's easily accessible by car. For a Friday night, this place was not too busy. I made a reservation, but it was not necessary.   The menu is pretty extensive and covers meats and seafood along with noodles, rice and vegetables. We ordered a number of items, including Kalbi with Bones, Saikoro Steak, and the Seafood Chijimi. The pricing is comparable to other Japanese and Korean style BBQ restaurants.   Just a note of caution, some of the translation is not correct. There were a couple of items that had completely different meanings in Japanese and English. Also, as others have mentioned, the grill is not the best for a restaurant like this. Firstly, it's tiny. Secondly, the electric grill takes a while to heat up. We were often just staring at the meats and vegetables to grill. I can't imagine ordering chicken. Our kalbi with bone actually came frozen so we put it on the grill to just thaw.  As for service, it was pretty good. One woman was very personable and came to our table frequently. I felt bad because she had to compensate for her colleagues though. With the bill, you get a little dessert. The complimentary custard pudding was a nice touch.  Goen is experience growing pains. Japanese BBQ restaurants need more energy and enthusiasm. Also, part of the excitement is grilling meats and trying all different types within a short period of time instead of spending a lot of time just watching your food cook.  Good for: Japanese BBQ"}
{"text":"Came to Goen hoping to get some authentic Japanese yakiniku experience, but left disappointed.   First of all, the grill is horrible. The wire mesh sits on top of a weak electric heating element, so the cooking is purely from radiant heat. Any meat not directly above the heating element doesn't get cooked, making the usable cooking surface very small. So expect a very slow meal, cooking only a few pieces of meat at a time. Also, they don't come and change the grill, so after cooking a few pieces of meat, you end up with a very dirty and black soot-covered grill. Very different from good Yakiniku places in Japan/Korea where you have a nice hot natural gas grill or fresh charcoal bucket, and where they come to replace your grill after every couple of dishes.   The ventilation is also horrible as the pipe above the grill has almost no suction power, so most of the smoke just floats up. So the restaurant was very smokey and all my clothes smelled like meat afterwards (went to visit a friend with a dog later in the day and he was slobbering all over me!!!)   The food itself wasn't too bad. The marinade is tasty and not overpowering. The plain pancake and bibimbap was good (tasty and reasonably priced). The pork neck was delicious and the rib eye steak was pretty good. The wagyu was very disappointing though... Granted we got the cheapest of the 3 wagyu (American, Australian, and obviously most expensive Japanese). But even American wagyu should be tender and flavorful. I made sure not to overcook it and it was still nice and pink in the middle, so I'm guessing it was just a bad cut of meat. Definitely wasn't worth the price... All the BBQ meat portions are small, expensive for what you get, and I feel there are much better options elsewhere.   The service was pretty good (other than the fact that they don't come to change the grill). Lady was friendly and came to fill the tea regularly. However, the service for bringing out the food was very slow, even with only a few tables with customers. When we asked about one of the items, we were told to be patient... That was after we waited 45 mins for the slices of onions!   Sadly, given the horrible grill, poor ventilation, slow service and even slower cooking time, I definitely won't be back for the BBQ. I may get the bibimbap and pancake again, but takeout so I don't smell like a pot-roast after the meal! They just opened recently so hopefully they will get their act together and improve, otherwise I don't see them lasting very long..."}
{"text":"Despite the lukewarm reviews, my friend and I liked Goen! Everyone complained about the grills on the table but they worked pretty well for us. The wagyu beef was really good as was the steak sashimi...actually everything that we had was good (we also had the tomato salad, vegetable pancakes, kimchi pancakes and bibimbap). Not too thrilled about the uncovered condiments - the restaurant should have them covered. Service was 5/5 - our server was very knowledgeable and helpful! We also got complimentary custard desserts. Would definitely be down for coming back to try out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= It's new so everything seems pretty clean.  Staff was friendly, and helped us through the menus as well  One hygiene issue: - the sauce containers have no lids.   - Some of the sauces seem like they are portioned for one sitting but the chili paste is definitely not.  - I'm concerned about people sneezing, coughing, etc... into the sauces - I'm doubly concerned about what happens at night...  One grill issue =========== - Grill is REALLY SLOW  - Like agonizingly slow...  - If you are going in hungry I suggest ordering an appetizer.   Food ===== Meat - Seems fresh when raw - Tasted good when cooked - The Wagyu cut was good, but no where near as good as other places that have Wagyu in Toronto / Japan.   Vege ===== - Fresh - Seasoned well   Cooked Food =========== - We ordered Seafood pancake, this dish was on par with other Korean places - Spicy Ramen, it's not instant noodles so there's that.  Noodles were over cooked so they did not have a chew to the noodle--actually it was a bit soggy.   Would I come back? =============== I'd come back just to try out all the other items in the menu.  The food is good and the price is reasonable.  I think the cost of eating a full meal here would cost about the same as a good quality ayce table bbq.  So... I'll update the review after a second visit!"}
{"text":"Their beef is fresh from Japan with reasonable price. Nice place to hangout with friends. Kimchi pancake is good as well. Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"I have try many Japanese BBQ place and this the best one so far .Fresh ,Tasty ,great service !!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and it never disappointed me. I love the variety of meat and organ meat it provides. Beef tongue with salt and green onions, pork intestine, skirt steak, short ribs, wagyu beef, pork loin, cucumber salad, lettuce salad, seafood pancakes are my favourites. Another thing I like is that the spice they provided is spicier than other Japanese BBQ restaurants.  I only give four star because I feel some of the soup dishes can be improved and the size of wagyu beef is smaller than it used to be."}
{"text":"I went there with my family for dinner this past Thursday and had a great experience. Decor and surroundings were very comfy and my two kids were very comfortable in the big table at the end.  Service was really good, and being the first time there, they helped us cooked all the meat to perfection.  Food was good, the beef was pretty good quality....I believe they mentioned that all beef was angus, and the wagyu was from japan.  6 of us for dinner (4 adults + 2 kids) costed 150 bucks...which is very reasonable for the quality of food!"}
