{"text":"So our experience at the Blue Line Grille wasn't terrible. But it was definitely bad enough that we will never be going back.

First off, our waiter was very inexperienced, which is completely understandable with it being a new restaurant, but it was almost as if he hadn't been trained. He did know which beers were wheat beers (he offered us an IPA, which is most definitely not what we were looking for). He kept hanging around our table when we tried to politely make it obvious that we were not interested in having a conversation with him. After he delivered our appetizers he told us about the dinner menu after hearing from us twice that we only wanted a few small plates and beer, we weren't interested in dinner. He was very nice, but he could have used more training. 

However the food is the reason we won't be going back. We ordered their Smoked Paprika Garlic Smashed Cheese... Which was just cold chunks of butter and garlic! I'm not even sure it was real garlic and not just garlic powder! How were we expected to spread chunks of butter on the pretzels that accompanied the dip, I do not know. It was definitely not as advertised, I couldn't taste the paprika at all, I think they just added enough for some color.  As for the \"smashed cheese\", well I think they left the cheese in the kitchen. It was disgusting. How is this considered as signature item??

We also got the Parmesan Chicken Tenders, which were SO bland and quite dry. Does this place not know what salt and pepper are? The chicken tenders could have easily been acceptable with a bit of easy seasoning. The mustard that came with them was at the opposite end of the spectrum and absolutely overpowering.

If they can mess up on easy items that are just appetizers how can they possible manage to offer full dinner entrees? The prices are way to expensive for what you are getting, the portions are off kilter and the beer slightly overpriced. You would be better off going up the street to Milano's for pizza and beer. You'd spend a fraction of the price and get much better quality food."}

{"text":"Was there last night before the Robert Morris vs. PSU hockey game.  The bartender was EXTREMELY rude!!  Every seat at the bar was taken so we went to the end where the servers pick up their drinks just to order and not have to yell over people.  Rather than just asking us to move down away from that area he rudely just stated \"this isn't a serving area\". Last time I checked a bar/restaurant should be in the business OF SERVING PEOPLE.  Needless to say we left and took our business to another bar where we were promptly served."}
{"text":"A medium group of friends and family gathered here for a birthday party.  We were originally set to sit outside but since it was raining they roped off an area inside for us.  Our waiter Kevin was prompt even as he collected more tables towards the end of the night.  He is extremely nice and very good at what he does.  We ordered a bunch of food and Chris came out to greet us.  He was extremely nice and the lobster sliders were out of this world.  The decor is trendy but not tacky.  Pricing was pleasantly surprising.  We expected to cringe at our bill but felt it was completely fair.  Parking is a bit of a concern but considering the location (across from Consol) it is to be expected.  If you have the opportunity visit this place you will be happy that you did."}
{"text":"We came here before a concert at Consol Center. It's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here. We got lucky & got a table only hour before the concert!! We ordered a pizza & it was good for a bar. Good selection of beers!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoyed the food/drinks but wasn't blown away. I was most recently there on a night that Consol had a concert so the restaurant was PACKED. The waitress was obviously busy (our service was slow)  but she managed to keep an eye on our table and did a good job keeping us all satisfied. 

The food wasn't anything to call about. The fish tacos were pretty dry and a bit bland, a few others at the table ordered the club and weren't impressed either. However- someone else at the table said the pulled pork sandwich was awesome. 

Blue Line is a nice and convenient place to go before a game or concert but it's not really somewhere I would go to 'just because'"}
{"text":"I reallllyyyy want to like the Blue Line Grille, I really do. It's close to my work and different from the other places nearby. That being said, I ordered takeout today and got a buffalo chicken wrap. Well, now that I am back at work I realize there's no buffalo sauce on it! How does that even happen when there is not even a plain chicken wrap on the menu? The last thing I want to do on my lunch break is spend another 10-15 minutes walking there and back to correct their mistake. I have ordered from here three times so far, first time I really liked it, second time there was a hair in my food and the third time this happens! The Bartender was friendly and their prices aren't bad. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"This is not the blue line grill anymore. It is now called Buford's. There are new owners, new menu, and apparently a staff that has never worked in a restaurant before. My girlfriends and I came here before Amy Schumer and since the moment we were seated it has been a nightmare. Our server is nice but has about 100 tables, so getting a drink proves to be a harder task then brain surgery. There is a younger tall blonde working whom we asked a question and her response was honestly the rudest thing I've ever heard in a restaurant. This place is an absolute joke now. The shorter manager( or owner not sure?) with curly dark hair is socializing with her friends as her entire staff obviously needs help. I get that it is a busy night but the crowd right now is nothing compared to what it will be for a pens game. I have never experienced something this bad. I will never come back nor do I recommend this place to anyone. If you liked coming here before a pens game please think again and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We stopped in before a wedding reception, the staff was more than friendly and even let us know how traffic was because a big concert was in town. They were so friendly, willing to talk to us and in a overall great mood! Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ok service. Food is marginal. Had the lobster roll. But it had too much mayo on top which masked the lobster. 

Had the nachos as an app and they were pretty plain. Cheese was weird."}
{"text":"OK, I'm not sure if the first two reviewers work there or what but both Phil Borque and Bill Guerin should get 2 minutes in the penalty box for being associated with this place. I'm not big on reviewing things but I do read what other people have to say so I thought this deserved my effort to help others out.

I went there on Saturday afternoon about 2 hours before the Pitt Duquesne basketball game. Attendance there was less than 12,000 so that means the crowd was about 2/3 of a typical home Pens game, and again this was a 1:00 tip hoops game.

I took my girlfriend and 3 kids and we ordered 2 salads, 2 burgers, and a dozen wings... so nothing too complicated.  It took over an hour to get our food!! There were waiters wondering around with plates of food asking people if that was their order or not because the table numbering system wasn't worked out yet. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  And they have these big fancy bottles that they pour water out of but the H2O tastes like it came from the Mon after a sewage overflow... NASTY!

So about 5 minutes before we were ready to get up and walk out our waiter, who was very nice by the way, comes out with our food. The house salad was actually pretty tasty but it's $13! That doesn't include any meat or seafood. It's another $4 to add chicken... so that's $17 for a grilled chicken salad. The chicken breast was cut in half horizontally so it looks like there are two breasts, but no, it's only one. It was so small that it looked like they sliced it off one of the pigeons walking around outside.  And it was so overcooked that it was more like pigeon jerky than grilled chicken breast. Absolutely AWFUL!!

I asked for my kids burgers medium well and both were WELL done and burnt on the outside.... again, just terrible. I would have sent everything back but we were hungry and wanted to get to the game in time for tipoff.  The wings were very average at best.

So if you want to have a few beers before the Pens game, it's fine. The location is excellent obviously.  Just don't plan on eating here... awful and overpriced are not a good combination."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with friends. Service was fine but the food was pretty bad. 

Chicken wings with the buffalo sauce: the sauce didn't have much flavor, really not what one would expect when advertised as a \"classic buffalo sauce\". As for the chicken all I could taste was stale/old/overused frying oil, which pretty much ruined them. 

Poutine: served in a small cast iron skillet with melted cheese on top and gravy on the side. This is not exactly poutine but more like their take on it.... No problem. The fries were very soggy and sitting in excess oil at the bottom of the cast iron pan. Just like the wings these fries tasted of that same nasty burnt out frying oil. 

This place would be good for drinks if your going to an event at Consol, but AVOID THE FOOD, they cannot execute the most basic of bar fare. Most likely I will avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and people were nice, but those were the only things I enjoyed. The staff was very unprofessional. They bickered with each other, the manager complained frequently about no-shows, and the bartender talked my ear off about strip clubs. The bartenders also had disgusting habits that lead to contamination, such as coughing on their hands before grabbing the rim of my drink and putting tickets on top of glasses. The food was subpar for the price. I ordered the club, which comes with a chicken breast on it. The chicken was fully cooked, but very cold...this was at 11AM so it had to have been cooked the night before and put in the fridge.

I will not be returning to this place...I don't want to get sick."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a second chance since first  visit was last year during College Hockey Tournament and they were still working out the kinks in the place. Food then was bad. This time went while Pens were next door. Pre-game crowd had just left, and crowd was gone but waiter was totally distracted. No service for ~20 mins. and then finally took order. Zero personality. Beer glass w/ a chip. Poured beer in another glass and was a snot about it. We left and won't be back. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"We visited before the Royal Rumble - with such a packed place we were waited on quickly and the staff was very attentive to our needs.  We had a large group of people and it was a great time.  The food was good and the beer was reasonably priced.  It is a definite spot to go to before games/events or for a good meal.  Our waiters Matt and Nick were awesome and Casey took great care of us!  I would recommend it and plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the Liquid Marijuana drink made by Josh!  Absolutely delicious!  Love their Pulled Pork Nachos also."}
{"text":"Nice building and good menu variety. We were the first customers of the day. The food was poorly executed. Some of the food was overlooked and come was cold. Something was spoiled."}
{"text":"We came in from Chicago for a hockey tournament, and I stumbled across this restaurant online. This place was AMAZING!!! The staff was unbelievably awesome, especially Katie who helped me with booking a reservation for our hockey team to have lunch during one of our games. Chris, the waiter, who took care of the boys table was REMARKABLE!! I HIGHLY recommend this place, and if I lived in Pittsburgh I would go over and over again!!"}
{"text":"22 NOV 2013 pregame Pens vs Islanders!  I would recommend getting there early.  The place was getting packed by 5:30. What a great place to start!  The service was excellent. The wide selection of beers on tap was great! The food was outstanding, had the wings, I recommend the fire and buffalo sauces, the Montreal poutine frites were so good I suspect they have a real Canadian in the kitchen! Make sure you try The Blue Lemieux, my special lady friend loved it! I had two Consigliere cocktails, Makers Mark with Grand Mariner plus simple syrup. It is a man drink made to perfection! TVs, TVs,TVs everywhere!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers and myself decided to try this place out for happy hour. It was about 4:00pm on a Friday.

No Pittsburgh Penguins game was scheduled, so the place was dead. A co-worker of mine called to confirm the rooftop would be open today.

The person on the phone gave confirmation. When we got there, the bartender treated us like we were sub-human / second class citizens. He looked at us like we were stupid for not knowing the roof wasn't open. \"Who told you that? Who did you speak to?\" Questioning our integrity about the matter.

Then, he stood there polishing the same glass over and over, when it was clearly visible we were ready to order (we were sitting right in front of him).

A member of our party had to speak up and say, \"Excuse me, we're ready.\" When it was my turn, I asked for a drink menu and he gave me pause, along with a dirty look. You'd think that I just asked him for his kidney or something. When I pointed to a drink and said, \"I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce that, but I want that.\"

He was taken back and said, \"Why do you have to be difficult. Can't you just get a beer? You can't even pronounce the name.\" In a completely demeaning and condescending tone.

Now, I'm not socially inept. I know the difference between fun, polite, friendly banter and a guy who absolutely doesn't want to be at his job or bothered to do anything other than polish a glass. He was making these remarks with a stern, serious look and a harsh vocal tonality.

No smile on his face, no laughing etc. I seriously felt like we weren't welcomed there. Like we weren't good enough. I just had the one drink and left. I was going to order food but suddenly I lost my appetite.

Bottom-line? Seriously the worst service ever. This place is awful. So many other great options surrounding the Console Energy Center and the downtown area that I'll never be back."}
{"text":"3 stars for the drinks and the amount of fun we had during our dining experience but 2 stars maybe even 1 for the food. I was excited to dine at Blue Line for dinner as I had only been for drinks. Our waiter was awesome and kept checking on us and quick to take our order. They have lots of great draft and bottled beer. I started off with the Fatheads Bumble Berry at a great price of only $5.50.  My date and I decided to share a large pizza which was plenty of food for the both of us. It took a long time to come out and was the worst pizza I had ever had. The dough was not cooked and the cheese was covering all the toppings-we got pineapple and bacon. It was like they knew it was a terrible pizza and thought a bunch of cheese on top to cover it up. The tomato sauce was running everywhere and watery. I was glad I also ordered a side Cesar salad to go with the pizza as it was almost inedible. It was Tuesday Trivia night (the last of the season) so we decided to stay and keep drinking. We had a blast and the host was fantastic.  Overall a fun night but very disappointed in the pizza. I will go back and hope the food is better!"}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time and the service was very slow. Crabcake appetizer came out late because they burnt it. On top of that my father's burger was extremely overcooked and tasted extremely salty. The fries were also re-cooked. We had two glasses of wine and a beer and the total of all three drinks was $29. A little pricey for a sports bar in Pittsburgh if you ask me. Also the communication between the manager and the servers was poor. Nice atmosphere but overpriced and average food.  Would not come here if in a hurry for a show. Manager was very kind, the only good part of our experience here."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!  we waited over 15 minutes without seeing a server in our area. I finally track one down, he goes to \"check\" if he is our server and doesn't come back for over 5 more minutes!  Absolutely will NEVER come back after the way we were served."}
{"text":"Had a great time there tonight!  Awesome place to watch hockey game / sports, great food (burger rocked and the \"the pucks\" dessert was unreal!) and cool staff!  \"Zoo\" was real entertaining and attentive to myself and my 6 yo. Nice to have a waiter who truly enjoys his job and pleasing his guests!!  The outdoor upstairs lounge is way cool and would be a great place to chill with your girl or friends after a game. Good times at the Blue Line and I'll be back next time in town!"}
{"text":"I was in tonight for the NCAA event at console...had a couple of awesome drinks created by your fantastic mixologist Terrance ..he was very attentive, quick and very personable...I will definitely be returning...he has made a regular out of me..see ya soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before going to a Pens game for dinner and drinks. Very crowded and loud as expected, since it's right across the street from Consol Energy Center. Service was actually good, considering how busy they were. The place was full of energy, so I would return to watch the game and have a few beers. But don't expect too much for the quality of food. Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance as we were walking around Consol Energy Center.  Attracted by the open air seating next to the street. Seated right away as it was a Saturday and the Pens were no longer in the play offs. 
Ordered the Poutine and it was great along with a pretzel roll/ cheese spread that was even better the next day warmed up. 
Our chicken pizza was not the best. Thinking maybe it was the sauce and a different pizza may have been a better choice, can't be for certain. 
Memorabilia was cool on the walls BUT somebody should have known they have hung the goalie pads BACKWARDS on the display. A little embarrassing being right across from hockey arena. 
Waitstaff was attentive, although not busy. 
Would like to return during hockey season to see the place thriving."}
{"text":"Came here before Pens game and was disappointed with limited menu,plastic plates and utensils.
Found out it has new owners in the same group as Andora.
Wings were cold.
Sliders were cold also.
Pot roast nachos was ok but was just so disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars for two reasons. Service and atmosphere is really pretty good, but the food is really sub par. 

We ended upstairs because the downstairs was packed. All of us on our way to Stevie Wonder. Limited menu upstairs which was fine, but the variety was the real limiting part. Sushi on one side and bar food on the other. We ordered nachos, sliders and loaded tots. Sliders were good, nachos were good, tots were not good. Nothing was great. What made it most subpar is that the same cheese sauce was on the nachos and tots and the same flavoring on the meat for sliders and nachos. You know when Rachel Ray does those shows where she takes one meal and stretches the leftovers? Yeah. Not so \"Yummo\" Rachel. 

I will say this. Great place to have a drink...rooftop was beautiful and inside bar area was nice, too. Proximity to Consol is perfect. The service we had was great especially because it was so busy due to the concert. 

I don't mind a small menu, but a slight variety and a little better quality would be an easy upgrade. I would return to have a drink, but I'll eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good local place to enjoy while we were in Pittsburgh. Blue Line Grill was just what the doctor ordered! We got the nachos and they were, messy, delicious and absolutely worth it! 

For dessert we got the deep fried Oreo! Wow!! 

This is a don't miss place it Pittsburgh!!

Ask for Jason, he knew the menu and did a great job!!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced in my opinion .  They have good salads. Burgers are average. The blueberry Long Islands get two thumbs up. It's a nice place to go before a pens game or for a happy hour in the summer because the windows / walls open up."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but after several visits it continues to disappoint. Came here for my birthday and was told fries with a sandwich are extra and there was barely any meat on it. Came back again for a salad and it tasted like pesticides. My friend also ordered one and thought the same. Drinks were incredibly watered down and didn't taste close to the description. I won't be coming back, waste of money."}
{"text":"The stars are for our server who was very nice. The food was bad, not going to sugar coat it. We each got a buffalo chicken wrap and shared nachos. They forgot to bring the app first, but stuff happens. The wraps were just plain bad and didn't even taste like buffalo sauce. I'm not sure how you mess up a buff chicken wrap, but they managed. The nachos were cold and simply not good. A bunch of gloopy cold cheese? No thank you. Overall a good location, but the food was bad. That was the first time we ever left nachos on the plate!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing display of hospitality! The drinks were bad from start to finish - I've never left a bad review btw - food was ok - it took 30 minutes to get a drink, like every time u spoke to the waitress, you knew it was going to take 30 minutes till she came back. This is across from an event center!!! They should be prepared and trained for Saturday nights! And it's atleast 3 years old."}
{"text":"Stopped at this restaurant with my kids after the Harlem Globetrotters event dec 26th.  I was looking forward to trying it since I had heard about it.  We came about 7:50, and were seated by the hostess after she gave us our menus.  When the server came he said that those menus stopped at 8:00 because the kitchen closed, and he gave us a bar menu with limited items.  Also, the server was somewhat pretentious.  He couldnt understand what a B & B was when I ordered the drink, and came across as if I had no idea what I was talking about.  The food was nothing to write home about.  I am amazed at reading all of the negative reviews that the response is the same, \"sorry you had a bad experience\", etc, but if I were the manager I would wonder what I could change because of it as there are so many.  Great to apologize, but I wonder if anything changes...would not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Bar tenders were very full of themselves. We are paying customers who are willing to tip you, does that bother you? Bartenders acted like they were to busy to help a paying customer, next time (which there won't be) get over yourselves and get me a drink. Tools."}
{"text":"Very limited menu before a penguins game.  Pot roast nachos very fatty.  Pork slider sandwich very fatty also.   Service very slow.  We went about a year ago and it was excellent.  I understand me owners took over.  I hope they improve soon."}
{"text":"Five because of the staff. Hostess, bartender and wait staff were terrific. There on Saturday evening for dinner while town was still jumping from parade folk. The bartender knew exactly how to handle a few patrons who had too much Blarney and were looking for trouble. Defused a situation which I was watching and thought for sure wasn't going to end pretty. 

  Now the food, I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap which was good, wings were also good. Sweet potato chunks were a nice addition. I  recommend them highly! I also tried the Pork Chop sandwich which was tasty. Good draft selection!  

  Everyone seemed to feel that the food was good sports bar food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for the Mayweather Pacquiao fight. It has was a great atmosphere The customer service was impeccable very kind the food outstanding I had the \"ol'niner burger\" it was cooked to perfection out of this world! To put an exclamation point on my visit.The drinks were strong"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!  Last night after Black Keys concert (fabulous!), stopped in.... Wasn't that busy but service very slow and servers mixed up tables.  Girlfriend ordered a coke which was half full when it came...finally.  She asked if she could change it to a rum and coke but didn't want to pay for both... Waitress, who seemed hurried and wanted us to hurry up and order every time she came to our table said \"no problem\" and brought a rum and coke.  Girlfriend didn't drink first one but we were charged for both.  We explained that this was our first time there and asked about dishes... Again.... Waitress just wanted us to hurry up.  We ended up ordering the lobster roll and some kind of mushroom pasta.  After waiting forever, lobster roll came... Smelled fishy, first bad sign but we were starving... It was on a hot dog bun.... Yes a FRICKIN HOTDOG BUN!  It had 1 quarter of a claw , a whole bunch of green lettuce, lots of mayo, and a few very small chunks of lobster?  Was rubbery with no taste.... Terrible!!!!  We didn't finish it.  The mushroom pasta was mediocre at best with gummy pasta and some kind of dried leaves in it?  We didnt finish it despite being starved!  Honestly, I don't usually complain and have never written a review before but we were so disappointed!  When we told the truth about the food, a manager came over and we told him how disappointed we were.  He defended the food saying how the mushroom dish is so popular.  Probably for first time orders, it sounds good.  I explained that I have season tix to Pens and was looking forward to checking this place out.  He gave us 2 cards for free appetizers and took 4$ and change off the bill but like I said before, we were charged for the coke 2$ and change so it wasn't much off the bill.  The right thing to do would have been to at least take one of the entrees off. Each was $20.  What a waste!  I see that there are a lot of bad reviews for the Blueline Grille and you would think the owners would have taken a good look at their service and especially their menu and chef.  On the upside, drinks had a fair amount of alcohol in them... That's the only reason for the 1 star.  We spend a lot of money during the hockey season before and after games but at this point won't be spending that money at he Blueline Grille!  Very sad! :("}
{"text":"Had a mighty fine lunch here. Service wasn't super quick, but it was okay. I had the ahi tuna tower, and really enjoyed it. Although I would have liked a bit more lemon, and the wasabi aioli was much more mayo flavored than wasabi, I still really liked it. The wonton chips were perfect, making it basically like tuna tartare nachos.

I'd come back."}
{"text":"Been down the BLG a handful of times and have enjoyed every time I have went!

If you are going to the Consol Energy Center, you have to hit the Blue Line Grill first, it's a must. It's the perfect location...right across the street from the arena. From Concerts, to Pens games we always make sure we head to the city early to beat the traffic and chill with our favorite Bartender Jason...aka Smutzy. What a delight this guy. Constantly making us laugh with out going over the level of professionalism. No matter what type of guests i brought with me, to what ever type of event we were going too, everyone LOVED Jason. 

The BLG is huge, and can no doubt get a little jammed  by the front door during events, but that's why you get here a little early to relax and have some cocktails served up by the Smutz. So get your ass away from the front door and head the upstairs. Or to the back..the joint has space to roam. Find what bar Jason is at, and you will never be let down with service....the guy and the staff hustle."}
{"text":"We had to wait an hour for seating, showed up 2 hours before game time. Jets at Pens game. Pens won 5-3! Go Pens! Anyway once we got seated service was fast. We were seated at 6pm and was served at 6:20. We knew we would be cutting it close to game time so we asked the waitress to take our food order at the time she took our drink order. We got the food and it was worth the wait. Big guy burger. Very good! Will be back! We made it out with 15 minutes to spare and with the arena just across the street, was very convenient! The 4 of us enjoyed everything we ordered! Friendly waitress and staff in general. Kept it together even though it was a mad house. Give it it try. We love Blue Line Grill!"}
{"text":"The Blue Line Grille / uptown was recommended to us by the hotel we were staying at.  We love roof top bars since there are none in the area where we are from.  This was a really great view and good beer on tap and the atmosphere was very modern. We decided to go downstairs to the blue line grille for some food since it was just drinks on the roof top bar.  We got seated really quickly but it took us a little bit to get our drinks. Once we ordered the food came in a good time and it was good.  My husband got wings and I got parmesan chicken fingers and we shared an order of fries. They had a huge selection of beer on tap and bottles.  I did have to go get napkins from someone because we did not have silverware or napkins. This does not work so well trying to eat wing. Our server only checked on us 2 times and my husband ended up going to the bar to get a drink and then they sent our server over to help us. I went and talked to the manager because I thought the server was either new or just not good.  We found out his section got moved and he was running all around the restaurant.  My husband was in food service for over 13 years (bartender and server)  so he understands that this happens and its hard to keep up sometimes.  The manager Brian was really nice and apologized for the poor service and he did not realize his front end manager moved our servers section and he was trying to cover 2 areas that were not close to each other.  We will defiantly go back and try The Blue Line Grille again.  We almost left and did not tip our server because we were so unhappy but I'm glad we talked to the manager and now understand what was going on."}
{"text":"Good place to go before a Pens game or another event at Consol. However, if you go for an event, expect a huge crowd. 

If you go at a \"normal\" time, this is a great place. They have a decent beer selection and bar, and we haven't noticed that they are ever light on their pours. All of the food we've ordered has been excellent. Highly recommend the lobster roll or the hangover sandwich. 

Also great for a large group. They have sections you can reserve."}
{"text":"Don't cater to customers very well. Especially bartenders who are more interested on what they want versus their customers."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, poor service.  Understaffed.  The staff they have working are \"too busy\" to focus on the needs and wants of their customers.  Danielle, the IC Light girl, is hot though, and the atmosphere is pretty good."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the drinks are nice and food is all good. A group of us were here prior to the Bengals-Steelers game. We ordered the quesadilla (interesting twist on it but tasty) and trying to keep it simple/fast we ordered either burgers or sandwiches. Shout to the person who mentioned the grilled cheese, they're not lying, fantastic recipe. Everyone said their plate & alcohol were great. However a few of the prior comments are correct...it takes a long time trust me. We were seated at 530 and left a few minutes after 7, which would be fine if the pace was on a schedule and even flow but this was like no man's land and then boom we had our beer. I don't care about 20-30 minute ticket times if I get quality but this was excessive. The staff were all very nice so I don't mind going back if they're always that nice. I honestly feel bad for them if they're like this now what the place would be like for a Penguins home game. A Penguin game means literally thousands of dollars waiting to be earned so I'd like to see them under pressure."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to the Blue Line Grill; we chose to grab a quick bite here, prior to catching a show.  Due to traffic, we arrived a little later than what we wanted to, but luckily the bar/restaurant was relatively empty and we were seated immediately.  Once seated, it seemed to take forever before the server came over to our table (5 minutes), but once we told him we were catching a show, our timeline was short, service was outstanding, we finished our meal, and were out in plenty of time to easily catch the show.

Beer:  They had 20+ beers on draft beer list and another 30+ in bottles.  For both draft and bottle they had a nice mix of big batch breweries and micro brews. 

Food:  We shared our meals to get the best of both worlds.  I ordered the Surf & Turf Burger (medium) with buffalo coleslaw.  My burger was cooked perfectly; it was a big leap for me to have crab as a topping, but overall the burger really worked.  The buffalo coleslaw was not very spicy; it is very different, and stands out from the generic mayo-slaw that you usually get.  The other Sandwich we got was The Hangover Cure.  This is a signature sandwich for them, and why, because it was really great.  The over easy egg made the sandwich a little bit messy to eat, but that was also what made it taste better.  The yoke mixed with the siracha just works. 

Pros:  It is very clean.  The service ended up being really good and the food was great. 

Cons:  For downtown the prices were competitive but overall it was a few bucks higher when you compared to things outside of downtown   

Conclusion:  I would never make a special trip to go there but when I have something to go to downtown and no event was happening at the Consol, I would for sure go there again.

{"text":"We really enjoyed our time at Blue Line Grille. After work on Friday we were walking around downtown looking for a place for a nice drink. I brought up BLG to Bobby since we haven't been there before. We headed there and our server was great. (i didn't catch his name, but he had the coolest beard) 

The drink menu is fun and unique but we still couldn't decide. We asked our server for suggestions on the strongest drink & he brought up long island.. why didn't i think of that?! haha. Bobby & I each ordered two long islands & I also ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which came my choice of fresh cut fries. The wrap was great & Bobby ended up enjoying half (order your own food, man!)  We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Around lunchtime today my husband and I ate for the first time at Blue Line Grille. Upon arriving, we did not have to wait for a table. The interior of the restaurant was designed fairly well. The waitress was friendly, served food promptly, and gave us a few drink refills. The food was acceptable for a restaurant and good for a bar (much better than the nearby Tailgaters). The Montreal Poutine Frites were not nearly as good as poutine that I have had in actual Montreal. The fries, cheese, and gravy did not really go together. Maybe the chef could add more cheese and make sure that it is gooier and not too solid, and he or she could use a different gravy. The boneless chicken wings with whole grain honey mustard sauce had a little bit of a funny taste. Maybe the chef could modify the sauce ingredients a bit. Our caesar salads with sourdough croutons and shaved parmesan tasted fine, although my husband ended up not liking his extra anchovies. My husband's lobster roll had a decent amount of lobster meat but had way too many chives. In the future the chef should keep the same amount of lobster but reduce the amount of chives. Overall, the food was OK, but I would recommend that the chef tweak the recipes a bit. I live nearby and will be returning to this restaurant to try some of their other appetizers and entrees (and maybe a dessert...!). I know that this restaurant is new, and I am rooting for it to be successful."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Definitly put a lot of money went into the place. The nachos were AMAZING and this comes from a girl who eats nachos on a weekly basis! Perfect delicious toppings to chip ratio. Oh and while on the topic the buffalo coleslaw was bomb like others should take notes. wow. Managers were also busting ass like in a good way. Super friendly and helping out everywhere. Heavy pours are also great to see when you're boozing. Service seemed pretty hectic but other than that super enjoyable time. Next time I wanna check out that roof top patio!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere near Consol.... But the positives stop there. Slow, unorganized service and poor food quality make this place one that you should skip in favor of almost anything else!  Shaved beef sandwich was infused with enough salt to store the beef outside on a sunny day without it spoiling!  Burgers ordered medium well were delivered as hockey pucks. The well-meaning staff attempted to serve us efficiently but clearly lack leadership and direction. Will not be back here."}
{"text":"Disappointed when the menu was VERY different from Blue Line Grill. Wish I would of known prior to coming and waiting for a table. (Seriously my fault since I knew the BLG was sold to Andora Group)

Andora Group is known for their great chefs at Willow and Andora in Sewickley, so I wasn't expecting a completely fried menu with the take over, now called Bufords Kitchen.

I am Gluten Free, so finding anything on the menu is impossible. Literally, salads or a naked burger is your only choice. So gluten and vegans stay away...unless your here for drinks.

Speaking of the bar...only 2 bartenders on staff (1st floor) on a Sunday evening and a large demand concert during the holidays. Not efficient. Very difficult getting a drink.

2 Stars for a few things: efficiency,  availability,  selection, opportunity. 

Sorry, but, I won't be back unless it's during the rooftop season for drinks only."}
{"text":"I first noticed this new place a few months ago, never had the chance to go. We went two weekends ago, and I was very impressed! We started with wings and poutine. Both were pretty good-the poutine perhaps I liked a little bit more, but only slightly so. I got fish tacos for my dinner. Fish tacos, in my experience, are very hit & miss... And these were a hit! The fried fish was great, and I really liked the whole chunks of avocado. The tacos were very tasty. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by before the Pens game for some drinks and appetizers. Wait was long as to be expected before a home game. Got seated around 615 and made it in time for the game. 
Service was excellent and the food was so good! The quesadillas are amazing! Was most impressed with how well they handled the large crowd and quality of the food was not affected. Definitely returning in the future. Our waiter even made us balloon animals!"}
{"text":"We visited before a Friday night Pens game in January. We arrived shortly before 5 pm and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. We proceeded to the bar and stood around with a drink. I was impressed with the variety of selections on draft. The sightlines to the TVs were good and the bartenders were surprisingly efficient considering the crowd.

As we watched others around us eat and the hour approached 6, we were doubtful about being able to get a seat and get food before we had to get across the street for the Pens game. We were texted for our seat just before 6 pm and promptly seated toward the back of the restaurant. 

We ordered right away and our food came fairly quickly, but not alarmingly so (as to think it was waiting for us under a heat lamp). I had the poutine frites and 12 baked wings. Both were good, but I wish there was more sauce on the wings. I'm not sure if it just doesn't stick as well to the baked wings, but the buffalo sauce wasn't as prevalent as I hoped. The jerk rubbed ones were good with a hint of sweetness. The gravy on the poutine was the highlight for me. My other dinner guests had a pasta dish and a salad, both were reported to be excellent.

We were able to eat comfortably and get to the game in plenty of time."}
{"text":"Okay,so we went there for late dinner , online it says opened till midnight . They say kitchen closes at 10:15 !!! , the place was full of drunk people struggling to stand on their 2 feels. I have a coupon from the hotel,but not even considering going there again."}
{"text":"OK came here before the Fleetwood Mac concert. Really hate to see a bartender eating during their shift at the bar and not washing their hands. I understand needing to eat, but do it in the back of the house. Not while you are pouring drinks. Kinda grosses me out. Hostess stand is the favorite hangout for staff. Often more noisy than the customers before it got rockin busy in there. 

Now the food. Ordered the poutine frites. The gravy was super thick, lumpy and not much flavor. Not worth the price at all. I got the BLT avocado salad with tuna. Presentation was very lacking and I expected a nice sear in the fish. It looked like it was thrown onto a cold flat top. Lots of bacon and ripe avocado but very few tomatoes. Overall could have been much better. 

My mom got there signature burger. It was overcooked, very little Cajun seasoning, and since she got the wild mushroom side dish they decided to put some mushrooms on her burger. The sauteed wild mushrooms for $6 had no flavor and looked old and reheated. I regretted getting a side of them as I love mushrooms. 

The kicker is we only ate there, only water at the show and we ended up not feeling so well. Fun for cocktails but I don't recommend the food... at all! Kinda sad the place is nice and has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Very nice staff.   Seating by the open garage doors was a nice way to eat on this 70 degree June day. 
The Cuban sandwich was excellent- highly recommend.   Despite that, had to go two star as the burger was only okay and we didn't enjoy the fries... Super salty."}
{"text":"Meh, went on a non game Friday night at 7. Empty. Get some poutine and it had what looked like burnt shredded cheese. I asked if that's how they do it and they brought me a new corrected order. That one had a thick layer of grease in the cast iron but was not a dead one they tried to pass off. We each got a burger. Not offensive. The \"slaw\" that we got was brown and grey like Pittsburgh in February. The one bite I had proved it was not spoiled, just gross looking. Meh, paid and left. I'll take my game day antics to another place."}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday night for an event and I really liked it!  Welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Marriot and strolled down for Dinner before a concert. The Nachos were great. I had the fish tacos, which were an A+ and my daughter had the NY strip, which was fantastic. The Chef delivered all our dishes. Great place!"}
{"text":"Fun place to bring a group of friends get a bottle and some apps and chill upstairs on the rooftop look at the city on a nice spring/summer evening/night .. This place is BIG!! Too enjoy it..."}
{"text":"I had been to Blue Line multiple times before last night,however,last night was the first time I tried any of their food. And I must say, I was actually surprised that, overall, everything I tried was very tasty. My boyfriend and I were meeting my brother here while he was in town for the penguins game, and it was packed because of a concert at consol that night. We did a lap around the bar and came up empty so we put our name in (45 min wait) and grabbed a table at Uptown to get a few drinks first. Personally, I think Uptown has the better drafts than Blue Line and I was surprised to see there were so many on upstairs that were not on tap downstairs. We were seated at 7pm, which was exactly what we were hoping would happen since the game began at 7pm. Our server came over quickly and got our drinks. We started off with the Poutine which was pretty good. Not overly salty at all (like Station's street was when they were open) and just enough cheese. The gravy was on the side which I lied that touch so we could all put our own amount on. I wish the fries were a bit crispier but it was still good overall. My brother had the buffalo chicken wrap, my boyfriend had a burger, and I had the chorizo and wild mushroom quesadilla. They both liked their meals and mine was surprisingly one of the better quesadillas I've had in awhile. After our meals came service pretty much stopped though. My brother asked for more water twice and never got any. I ended up letting him drink my untouched glass and he also ended up drinking my boyfriend's water as well. The server did bring beer when we asked and a box but apparently could not be bothered with bringing more water. Mark Madden was actually at the table next to us and had a personal buffet set up for him. Besides his annoying commentary the entire game, everything else at Blue Line was positive enough to return in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Absolutely ridiculous!!  Do not go upstairs. Here for Paul McCartney concert at 530 and NO service. I mean none.  I guess it was the first night for the kitchen to be open. After some discussion, they comped our anniversary meal. I never do this. They handled it respectably though."}
{"text":"Bartender played audio for the Pitt basketball game while the whole place was reserved for a private party.  Play music moron we pay your rent.

Bumped up to two stars since they put music on 20 Min after my review."}
{"text":"This place was surprising good.  I was staying up at the Marriott and those restaurant was packed.
I like that they had a gluten free menu.  I had the spinach salad with avocado, bacon and chicken.  Greens were fresh and dressing was good.  
Service was good too.  I'd check it out again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"This is the second time here. Only went because  a friend works there. First experience  was great didn't have food. Second visit  was not so good. The 2 bartenders behind bar were useless. Me and one other gentleman were the only two at bar. Maybe 15 people  in booths. Not busy at all. Took about 15 mins for the 2 bartenders to even acnolidge me. Ordered  a drink and some food. Food came and was good. I need a refill on my drink and both bartenders  were talking to other workers from kitchen at end of bar. My drink sat empty for about 15 mins as they both walked right past it on the edge of bar out in the open. I finally got the bar backs attention  and he refilled  my drink as the 2 bartenders were both on their  phones showing each other pictures. I asked for my bill and it was not even close to being my bill. I was the only person at the entire bar!!!!. I will not be coming  back and hope management does something  about it or will just rely on concerts and hockey games to make any money at this place."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying this place has a lot of potential.  The location is great for pre or post game visits at Consol.  I also noticed the main floor had garage door-style walls, and they have a roof top bar, so it should be a great place for drinks and fresh air (one of my favorite combos) in the spring/summer.

I visited for the first time today for lunch.  Our party of 4 was invited to sit in the penalty box area, which gave us some privacy and a cool view of some of the autographed hockey sticks displayed on the wall.  The menu was not expansive, but we all found a salad that sounded great after overindulging during the holidays.  I ordered the house salad with chicken, which includes tomatoes, currants, pumkin seeds, gorgonzola, and balsamic dressing.  Or it was supposed to include all of these things.  My dish was served and it consisted of lettuce and chicken.  Lettuce and only chicken.  I dug through the heap of greenery in search for a single seed, a slice of tomato, perhaps a crumb of cheese, but to no avail. 

To not delay our lunch, I did not share my search expedition with our waitress when she checked on us, and ate what was served to me.  The silver lining is that the chicken was juicy, the spring mix appeared fresh, and the dressing was quite tasty.  If all the ingredients advertised to me on the menu were included, this would have been a very satisfying meal.  However, what I received was not worth the $12 price tag.

My only other complaint is that the booth seats in our section were pretty uncomfortable, as they truly resembled a penalty box (no cushions for the rule breakers).

Though not the greatest first impression, I would give this place another shot - perhaps for a happy hour in a few months when the cooks/staff are a little more experienced and the weather is a bit warmer.  I bet a few beers would help the seat comfort as well!"}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Line several times since it opened and I have only had positive experiences.   The food and the atmosphere is great and the staff made me feel welcome and offered great suggestions.  

Everything was fresh, made from scratch and was really great quality.  

I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Place was empty (but there no event at Consul Energy Center) but the food was awesome. 

We had burgers (cooked medium rare) and they were thick, juicy and delicious. Awesome topping options. My girlfriend had the BLG fries which were tossed in garlic butter (they were not greasy) and bleu cheese crumbles. They were so good!!

Tons of beers and drinks to choose from. Seems like there are half off appetizers ($5) and drink specials often. Our waitress was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I have only been there prior to a Pens game but this is the perfect place for that!  It's right across the street from the American Eagle Outfitters entrance so even if you have had one too many you can still find your way into the arena.  The bar area is very nice with quite a few TVs and there are plenty of tables.  Upstairs is a little more laid back and will be really cool once they finish the outdoor deck going around the building.

I only had Doc's Nachos for an app so I can only comment on them.  They were a little lacking in substance but were tasty nevertheless.  The bartenders were very attentive and I had no problem getting a drink within a minute of my glass being empty.  

Definitely a place I will continue to support!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was SO looking forward to this meal. Our family researched the menu on BLG website at home as well as in the car again on our way down to the restaurant.  We were attending the Pittsburgh Power football game on 7/26/14. We ordered 2 of the Pork Sandwich only to be told Oh those have been removed from our menu as well as the Peppers appetizer,  Fire and Ice Crepes & the Chocolate cake desserts.. WHAT.. They ALL still appear on the BLG website menu as well as the MENU IN THE RESTAURANT...

The saving grace was our servers Zoo and Katie.. They could not be more apologetic and helpful.  The only reason I am giving this a low rating because of the lack of items we were looking forward to. The meal was good but the servers were the highlight of our meal..

Would I be willing to give the restaurant another chance.?? Perhaps if they get a menu that can be sold as it APPEARS in all print outlets!!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad bar service!

I want there with a friend for the Penguins game.  It was jam packed, which is not a big deal, because most bars are, but the staff seemed to be not only overwhelmed, but also extremely irritated.  

I watched a bar tender argue with a guy at the bar about what kind of sandwich he ordered and what the bartender \"heard\" vs what the patron \"said\".  Since when does the bartender argue about a sandwich?  You should have seen the people in shock, because the argument lasted for over a minute, with the bartender pointing to the menu saying \"This is what you ordered right?\"  It was like some jerk yelling at his kid.  Unreal.  

So then, when my friend ordered a beer and tried to get this other bar tender's attention with a \"head nod\" (you've all seen it, you make eye contact and give the bartender a little nod to let him/her know you want to order), this bartender looked at my friend and nodded over and over with this stupid sarcastic grin, like he was irritated with how my friend tried to get his attention.  Again, me and the other customers were looking at each other in shock...do you really want us to come to your bar?...or would you rather be jerks?

So after the beer was ordered, I am not kidding you, but it sat under the tap for a good 3-4 minutes after the bartender walked away, just sitting there.  We were beyond shocked because there was no apology.  Ridiculous.

We decided to go upstairs to the deck which is nice.  Its a 4 floor elevator ride and its a total cluster.  People coming out, people coming in.  Its a tiny elevator and you have to wait in line to get on it.  Just not convenient.  Again, the deck is nice, its outside, decorated well, but there is no food up there, just drinks and an inside bar area.  Couches and tables.

Overall, I would not go back.  There are plenty of places in the area that want to serve you, not argue or be jerks.  Like the Red Ring on Forbes Ave, or 5th Ave Cafe down the street, or the Marriott, or the Cambria Hotels."}
{"text":"Had a great experience ! Great location ,right across the street from consol energy center. Jason stultz was out bartender,this guy could be considered the very best in the Burgh, I highly recommend asking for him by name of you go here , he's hilarious!!"}
{"text":"I really like their food a lot. Also because the inside is blue which is my favorite color. They are very professional and fast whenever I come for pick up. The drinks are so bomb and it's not too strong or too weak."}
{"text":"We went here as a group, and \"on a lark\". Never knew it existed. What a wonderful surprise. Food selection was what you would expect at a sports bar, but unique pairings and presentation. The food was excellent. I asked for a special combination not on the menu. Was also done very well. The place was exceptionally busy, but the service was excellent. We will definitely be back, for the next concert."}
