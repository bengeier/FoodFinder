{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Every dish can be prepared gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan. The food is typical Wisconsin fare but farm-to-table, which I sincerely appreciate. Our service was great. This place reminds me of the Old Fashioned but without the wait time and with higher quality food. I am already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  Definitely the best restaurant in Oregon with an awesome chef. My wife had the lamb sandwich/burger that was so tasty and moist.  I had the Shepard's Pie that was also fantastic and just the right size. Everyone that works here is so helpful and courteous. They have a large excellent selection of draft beers as well as the Speakeasy in the basement. The bar down there will be a great place to chill, have some drinks and watch a game. Down the road they're looking to serve Tapas in the Speakeasy as well. 

So if you haven't gone yet it's time, you certainly won't regret it. It's such a relaxed atmosphere.  I know we'll be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! We stopped there for a few beers Thursday night ( Boys night out ). Met my buddy there about 5:00, he was sitting at the bar. After 5 minutes sitting there with no drinks yet I asked him how longe he had been there, he said 5 min. I counted 6 people at the bar and 2 tables with 2 people each, 2 male bartenders and 2 female waitresses working the tables. The 2 bartenders walked past us several times not even acknowledging us. Well it's now more then 15 min sitting there and the 2 bartenders are still not acknowledging us, in fact the one has elbow on the bar, chin in hand, and the other next to him talking to the owner Chef David. Finally fed up we ask the waitress as she is heading to a table if we can order a drink from her,  sure she said. Expecting she would tell the bartenders we wanted a drink but no, she walks past them, behind the bar and ask us what we want. Now you would think that would be a clue to the bartenders, but no, not a clue!  We drank our beer and I said lets get the hell out of here but my buddy wanted to check out the speakeasy in the basement. The one bartender had gone down to man that bar, there's a couple at the bar ( up stairs bar earlier), and chin in hand bartender. We take a seat at the small bar, and mister ( chin in hand elbows on bar) does the same fricking thing! putting elbows on bar chin in hand in front of the couple and ask if they would like to have another drink,  totally ignoring us. At that point I had enough of this crape,  said this is \"bull. ..t\" got up and started to walk out,  Mr \"elbows on the bar\" finally acknowledges us saying \"sorry guys\".   Sorry Chef Dave, you're never going to see me in Charlies again!  We went down the street to HQ and were treated like customers should be. .. If I could give zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"Had the mushroom pasta opening night, service was excellent and the food even better. Sent my parents there the next night and they came back raving about the shepherds pie. All local ingredients. The building is an old masonic temple, and the owner did a great job with the atmosphere and keeping true to the history and character of the building. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Unique. Fun. Relaxing. Speakeasy downstairs that is very authentic feeling! Excellent food and service. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a small vintage town flare. New menu features great options.  I had the Apple Salad and added salmon on top.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Visited for first time on a Friday evening for a quick drink.  Crowded but managed to find a spot at the bar after a few minutes.  All tables were full.  Bartenders were very friendly and recommended a couple of appetizers that we enjoyed very much (trout and bruschetta).  Drinks were good and were a good size for the money.  

Visited the speak-easy (waitress helped us find it)... a neat place if you have some time to linger.  All drinks are special-made by the bartender (can't order a simple drink here) and he will take some time to find out what you like and mix something up for you.  Cool idea, but we didn't have the time for it, which is why we ended up back at the main bar upstairs.  The people in the speak-easy were having fun, though."}
{"text":"In case people aren't aware, Charlie's on Main is owned by Chef Dave Heide who's the same owner and head chef at Liliana's in Fitchburg.  He was voted best chef in 2017 and the food at Charlie's makes you understand why.  

Charlies on Main was also voted best new restaurant in 2017 but first thing to understand is that Charlie's on Main is not what I would consider a restaurant.  It's more of an upscale bar/pub and grill.  There's a shuffle board within the restaurant and a full sized bar that takes over about 1/3 of the restaurant.  Seating is a little limited but for me the overall atmosphere within Charlie's is perfect.  Small and quaint with an old fashioned appeal.

Once you sit down you realize how diverse the menu is.  From tacos to Sheppard's pie, the menu isn't huge by no means, but there's a very diverse selection with what they have on there.  The appetizers are extremely good and when you begin to eat your meal you completely realize how fresh this food is.  A lot of restaurants will advertise their fresh foods that are locally grown, but this is one of the few restaurants I've been to  where you can taste the freshness of your meal and the extra time in preparation.  The drink/cocktail selection was very good as well.  A lot of in house cocktails and a nice selection of beer on tap.  

I will definitely be going back to try more food and if your looking for a nice small local place, then I'd definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried this place 4 times. I was not impressed. I tried the pulled pork tacos the first time. It was dry and cold. I tried it because I love new ideas. It's cool to be creative, but it should taste good. The fish fry was terrible. I think someone made the tarter sauce and forgot to refrigerate it. I ended up saturating the fish with lemon to finish it. I think the worst part was the bartender. There is no way she was sober. She was just laughing obnoxiously. My friend that took me there was really excited until she tried her old fashioned. The cheesesteak was tough. I guess where else would you go in Oregon?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Husband and I stopped here for a quick dinner at the bar. I had the short rib sandwich on Rosemary focaccia and husband had the lamb burger. I LOVED my sandwich. So incredibly flavorful and the meat was so tender. It had a horseradish aoli sauce on it that blended so well with the other flavors. I ate it with a knife and fork so it was really more of a dinner! Delicious!
Husband's lamb burger was also amazing (I of course tried it)! Quality feta on it and a cucumber sauce...just awesome. I will be getting that next!

In all honesty, every single item on the menu looks like something I want to try. They locally source almost all (maybe all!) of their ingredients and you can just taste the quality. You pay a few dollars more than a sandwich somewhere else but far below what you could be expected to pay for the quality. I think my sandwich was $12 and husbands $11. It came with a tasty pasta salad side and a very tasty unconventional kind of slaw. We also split a plate of the pommes frites which were $4 and came with two sauces. The homemade curried ketchup took me back about 20 years to something I had in Germany. 

I'll be back MANY times I'm sure. Oh, and check out the speakeasy downstairs! Great place to relax with a bourbon or nice glass of wine. I am just so glad this place is here in Oregon!"}
{"text":"Service was a real struggle. the cheese curds were good but the fish fry was poor, no flavor and soggy."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience during our first visit to Charlie's. The atmosphere was great all around. The hostess, bartender, and server were all top notch. Nice, personable, professional. There was a half hour wait, to be expected on a Friday night at 7:30. We were able to wait for our table in the downstairs bar/speakeasy! It was so charming and cozy with a fireplace and comfortable leather couches to lounge. We couldn't be happier to have such a great place so close to home!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Charlie's was amazing.  But every visit after that has left me disappointed.  We went last December and I actually left without eating any of my meal.  The burger I ordered was over done and my bun was so hard it could have been used as a brick.  Our waitress rarely checked back with us and didn't seem to care that I hadn't eaten any of my meal or that I didn't want a to-go box for it.

Then we wanted to enjoy some late night drinks with some friends another evening and even though they are advertised as being open until 10pm on Saturdays, they were closed when we arrived at 9.  I inquired on their Facebook page and after 2 weeks I finally received a reply that they close early if they don't have much business.  But if you're closed you won't get any business at all and now I don't have much faith that you will be open the next time I want late night drinks and therefore may go to another bar altogether.  

Not sure what happened to Charlie's but I'm still holding out hope that they can turn things around.  It seems that they have gotten busier since they opened up to weddings but we also went there one night when there was a wedding and it basically makes it impossible for someone to come in for a meal or even a drink when there is a wedding going on.  Even just having 1 more bartender down in the speakeasy during a wedding would go a long long way."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Wife a I had the bacon cheeseburger and fries plus cheese curds for an appetizer.  Everything was flawless!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds were fantastic.  Burgers were small and overcooked- could have made much better (and bigger) burgers at home.  Fries were under seasoned and crazy that fries are $2 extra!  Don't go to Charlie's for the food (other than the curds).

Experiencing the speakeasy part of Charlie's was fantastic- my boyfriend and I were alone in the basement lounge/bar and really enjoyed it.  It felt special and unique, and would really recommend going to Charlie's and entering through the bookshelf into the basement bar.  Unforgettable and felt like we were getting to be a part of history!"}
{"text":"100% of the menu is or can be gluten free. Like another reviewer mentioned, the menu isn't huge but it is thorough and well-crafted. Excellent cheese curds and I loved my spicy chicken sandwich. Great cocktails too and check out the secret underground speakeasy!"}
{"text":"Good addition for Oregon and surrounding area. We stopped on way to Stoughton Opera from Madison. 

Farm to table with just enough interesting ingredients without going over the top. 

Not a huge menu but a great option in almost every category and they are VERY accommodating for vegetarians and vegans. 

Good ambiance. Could use a fireplace but so could most places in Wisconsin. Also looks nice for events. 

We only had time for small plates, and I was not very hungry, so I was very impressed with the flavors and quality. Full disclosure - I know and respect the chef - especIally for his charitable works - but that does not mean I can not give an objective review. 

The soups were really a standout. The onion soup tastes like a meat base but was vegetarian. The wild mushroom was complex and woody and creamy and an outstanding soup. We had the frites, which I usually find heavy but the home made fruit Ketchup was great and the aioli was light. Beet salad was also great. 

Great beer, wine and cocktail list. 

They were busy and some folks ordered craft cocktails and I was getting a little annoyed my glass stood empty for a few minutes, but the bartender was perfect - he did the right thing with a quick apology which I was happy to accept and appreciate and he grabbed up a refresh quickly. 

Pricing is good. 

All in, an excellent second effort for Chef Dave Heide and while I am sick of farm-to-table in the Madison area, this restaurant is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We were in Stoughton for the Syttende Mai Festival. Since all of the restaurants were packed for the festival we decided to drive over to Oregon and see what we could find there. The downtown area had a cluster of restaurants and Charlie's seemed the most appealing so we headed in.

There's a nice looking wooden bar area and a row of tables that run down the side as well as a few tables up front. It appears they have event space next door as well. At the back was a long shuffleboard table type game. The bathrooms were clean and well appointed. The atmosphere felt like a mix of bar and diner. There were multiple tables with single men and one or more kids so it's apparently a place dads bring their kids.

The menu felt a little up-scale but was reasonable priced. We ordered the cheese curds, shrimp and grits, and wisco cheese steak. The cheese curds were fabulous. Excellent portion for the price. Melted, gooey inside, slightly crunchy outside. Served with a sriracha aioli, this was definitely a hit. The fries served with the wisco cheese steak were also outstanding. Crispy, crunchy, just a bit salty, hand-cut w/the skin on, I think they might have been double-fried. These were perfect and exactly how I like my fries. The peppers and onions on the sandwich were perfectly cooked. The meat actually had the flavor and texture of pot-roast. It was not what i was expecting on a steak sandwich. The butter-cream sauce on the grits was delicious and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. We were too stuffed for dessert but the chocolate at the next table looked amazing.

Our drinks were also well-made and reasonably priced. Our server was friendly and courteous. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive down to Oregon to eat at Charlie's, but if I was already in the area, I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here one night for dessert and coffee.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender was awesome and we had really good desserts."}
{"text":"Rather disappointing.  I am new to Oregon and when my daughter and her husband came to visit I thought of Charlie's as a nice place to visit. I believe it is run by the same guy that runs Liliana's so were were expecting great things.  Too bad it was meh.  Food was good.  Drinks were good. Service was ok.  Atmosphere was ok.  Nothing outstanding.  After dinner, we went down to the speakeasy to find no one there.  This was a Thursday night and it was supposed to be open."}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent visitors of this charming place. We enjoy it everytime. We love the impressive gluten-free options. Too many favorites to choose, but the cheese curds and fish fry are some of my go to's. The friendly and talented Chef Dave keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"So...andy & i came here quite a while ago, when they first opened, and had a pretty terrible experience. I decided it must've been a fluke because of how much we love Lilianas and know Chef Dave takes pride in the food, so we went back a 2nd time and now a 3rd. tonight's meal was even worse than the first so now we know for sure and will not be back again. Our waitress was very courteous but the service was EXTREMELY slow. Andy had a drink thrown on him but mistakes happen so we let that go no problem. 30min after ordering our appetizer & drinks we were still waiting though...that's a little much. We finally got the spicy shrimp appetizer and I was appalled that for $12 we only got 4 shrimp! Granted the shrimp were delicious. But 4?! Really?! After a long wait, my 'artisanal' grilled cheese came which was supposed to have bacon inside. It did not. It was like 2 crunchy pieces of bland toast with minimal
Cheese and way-too-sweet sauce. I thought the fish fry my husband got would be better so i stole a piece but took one piece and gave it back. There was more batter than fish, the fish was chewy, and the batter was almost mushy. I can't even properly describe how terrible it was. So i reluctantly finished my lacking grilled
Cheese. Ive had better fish at my local legion. In fact it's honestly the worst fish and grilled cheese I've ever had. That's pretty bad. I was also disappointed in the drink consistency. We ordered Dave's favorite, which was delicious. The second one, however, had much more casis and wasn't as good. Lastly we went for the chocolate pecan pie, which i imagined as warm, awesome goodness with a dollop of whipped cream like ive had at so many other places. Nope. Dead wrong. Cold, hard, and plain. The flavor was there, though, so had it been presented properly it would've been amazing. Now, here we wait for the bill...and wait...and wait..."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the new menu tonight. Chef Dave nails it all. Onion hay was a perfect app with a spicy dipping sauce.  We got the Bacon Mac & Cheese which was the best mac & cheese we've ever had. The Shrimp & Grits was perfect. Really great flavor & a good amount of shrimp. I could have just a little more sauce at the end but I know this is one of those dishes I am craving again in a day. Oregon had a real gem and I hope they appreciate it!!"}
{"text":"Great curds!  Very delicious burger.   The meatballs were tasty but they were kind of dry.     If you are in Oregon check this place out."}
{"text":"Despite some questionable past reviews about the service at Charlie's we decided to give it a try and are so happy that we did. Our service was excellent, the food was fantastic, the kids' menu was great and not totally predictable like most restaurants, and the house cocktails were really impressive, too. We had such a fun family date night there and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Happy hour with Reed or Derv's and amazing whiskey old-fashioned, and incredible chef, delicious burgers and just an incredible venue"}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Best mac & cheese I've ever had, and the secret passageway downstairs is awesome.  The rest of my table enjoyed their meals as well -- they had the chicken and risotto and burger.  

However, I was slightly disappointed as a vegetarian.  I was the only vegetarian at the table, and I picked the place because I incorrectly assumed that when they say they can make every dish gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan, they meant that they had more innovative, made-from-scratch, flavorful types of meat substitutes.  What they do is either remove the meat entirely or replace it with a Gardein meat substitute.  I imagine this is a good place to go if you're going with omnivores, since it's nice to have the option.  But if you're going because you want to try some cool vegetarian or vegan food, this is not the place.  Especially when juxtaposed with a delicious sounding omnivore-friendly menu, this is such a let down.  I also don't understand how they can justify the prices once you remove the meat -- the shepherd's pie, vegetarian, is just vegetables and mashed potatoes... for $12 or $14? No.  Absolutely not.  I'm not reducing my rating for that, as the food I had was delicious, but my advice is to adjust your expectations if you're a vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people for dinner and drinks.  The menu looked very good, and they seem to pride themselves on being farm-to-table, which is very appealing to me.  The server recommended the cheese curds, which sounded great, sounded great, so we said yes.  While they nearly melted in my mouth (they were good), they were super salty.  I had the burger with fries (normally the burger comes with coleslaw or pasta salad, fries are $1 more).  The burger was alright, but it along with the fries were excessively salty.  Others at the table also complained about the saltiness.  Two other people who got the pasta salad did not make it past the first bite.  The pasta salad had a cold tomato sauce for the dressing, and they did not care for it.  My wife and another person had the grilled cheese, which they both enjoyed.  I had a bite, but am not sure it was $11 good.  The server checked on us once while we were eating.  It looked like he was the only server, and it was a little busy.    I had an O'so sour with my meal, which was probably the highlight for me, except that it was poured in a small goblet glass.  This was on tap, but given the low ABV of this beer, I feel it could be poured as a pint. 

After dinner, we went down to the speakeasy.  My wife went to the bar to get some drinks, but was told they only carry bottled beer.  She asked for a Moscow mule, because she saw someone drinking one upstairs.  The bartender informed her they only make craft cocktails.  She said \"isn't a Moscow mule a craft cocktail?\", to which the bartender replied, \" here is the menu\".  The bartender was also not happy that the server was sending the dinner bills down to him (so people could drink downstairs and just pay one bill).  This seemed rather silly because it did not seem to be any more work than what he was already doing.  They had two flat screen TVs in the speakeasy, but when we turned one on, the bartender came over and said we could not watch TV, and turned it off.  Seems pretty dumb to have TVs in a room and not use them.  

Due to the poor quality service and salty food, I don't plan on frequently this place again.  If I'm going to pay Madison prices, I'd much rather go to Madison, where I know I'm going to have a better experience."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! If you haven't tried it, it's a must!

Short Review-
Food=awesome
Drinks=awesome
Service=spectacular

Details-
I've been here 10+ times so far and have loved every minute of it! The food is delicious. I've had many different dinners here including bacon mac, Diablo sandwich, tacos, and shrimp scampi all of which were mouthwateringly good. I've also had cheese curds, onion rings, shrimps, and fries for appetizers and each were good. This is the restaurant that my husband and I always want to go to!

The best experience has been going to the speakeasy downstairs for craft cocktails. Every drink is amazing and the atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"I am posting a second rating as a person who has used Charlie's event planning services recently. 

My father died this past April, and I needed to plan his wake in under a week. I called a ton of local places and mostly people were extremely rude (aka Holstein Kitchen). I was desperate for a place. 

My funeral director recommended Charlie's on Main - and it was the best choice ever. The people made it really easy to schedule; they were kind (and easy going) about the food; and when we went to scope out the place - it was beautiful. 

That day the food was amazing (especially the bacon wrapped figs!); the service was kind and accommodating; and the chef/owner came out to personally greet us and give us our condolences. 

This type of planning is extremely stressful and the people at Charlie's made it easy and were very kind in the process. If you are eating in Oregon - this is literally the only place you should consider. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese curds, cocktails, draft beer selection and multiple great dinner selections. Most recent favorite is the prime rib sandwich on focaccia bread.  Excellent!  And then there is the dessert selection...

This venue is needed in downtown Oregon, with a classy but not pretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"I expected better with the reputation.  The cheese curds were very good.  The cocktails were very good.  The bacon wrapped chicken enter was very over cooked, and the portion very small for the price.  The Mac and cheese was prepared and presented well, but had a strange aftertaste that we did not like.  Service was very slow."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time and was disappointed. We walked in on a Friday evening and it didn't seem busy, but a waitress/hostess said it was about a 10-15 min wait and they would text me when it's ready. About 25 min later I called and the lady seemed confused why I was asking for an update. I told them I needed a high chair when I put my name in and there was no high hair at the table after waiting and finally getting to a table. When the high chair came it was filled with crumbs. Waitress didn't wait long to greet us, but seemed scattered and stressed. The website said kid friendly, but they didn't have kids cups with lids. Atmosphere was just ok. Food didn't take long and the best part was the fries- they were amazing. Kids got a grilled cheese, but they used the butt of the bread for one of the slices... not something a restaurant should be using for a sandwich. Huge disappointment there especially when it was like $7.  I had the Diablo sandwich, it was just ok- needed more sauce, bacon was so undercooked I couldn't eat it, the peppers were not julienne like the menu described instead it was like 2 chunky slices. Not to be picky, but for this type of menu, the hostesses running around should be a little more dressed up than the exercise leggings, sweat shirts and tennis shoes they were wearing. They were also not very friendly. Overall service, food, and atmosphere were lacking and it was over priced for what we got- we won't be back."}
{"text":"So, I've been here twice. Once was for a vegan meetup group. I split vegan cheese curds with my boyfriend, which were AMAZING. He ordered the vegan ribs and I ordered the vegan mac n cheese, and we both enjoyed our food a lot. I really like the cheese they make there. 

However, we went back another night and had a bad experience. We took a vegan friend from out-of-town there for New Years, and they were out of the vegan cheese curds. Ok.. a disappointment, but understandable I guess (although it was not busy at all.) So we got the onion hay, which was good and came with a tasty sauce. I ordered the mac n cheese again and enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered the vegan fish fry and found it unimpressive and small. My friend ordered the vegan ribs, and this was the real surprise--they were not even CLOSE to ribs. It was a completely different product than what my boyfriend had been served during our first visit. Instead, it was some kind of fake chicken that seemed similar to tofu. My friend said it was very weird--basically like weird chicken slathered in barbecue sauce. And although the cheddar mashed potatoes are supposed to have a vegan substitution, they tasted completely plain to both of us who tried them. I would hope that if they were out of the items they were supposed to be serving according to the menu, they would let us know instead of bringing us a different dish. Maybe it was a bad night? 

On a better note, the bar downstairs behind the bookcase is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times it has exceeded expectations. They have a great selection of craft beer on tap, and a variety of delicious signature drinks. My personal favorite is the dewberry which includes house-made Rosemary infused vodka-it's awesome! Also a decent wine selection.

The food is absolutely outstanding - probably some of the best cheese curds in the Madison area and the jalapeño bacon aioli for dipping makes them even better. Their menu includes both restaurant dishes and rotating dishes based on is around - all dishes use LOCAL ingredients. My favorite is the Mac and cheese, which includes Nueskis bacon and is baked in a skillet shaped like WI! My husband has had two dishes off the rotating menu and has loved them both. The chef is also able to make everything gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan. Not a huge deal for us, but important for one of our friends with a wheat allergy! 

Both times we have stayed after dinner in the speak easy in the basement. Super cool atmosphere and super friendly staff. We even got to sample a drink the bartender was trying out last weekend!"}
{"text":"We loved dining here last night. We were there for happy hour, which was a  steal. There cheese curds are our new favorite, best we've ever had and a bonus for people with dietary restrictions - they gluten free! Our original brandy old fashions were great as well and came in a decent sized glass. Our waitress, Holly, was the nicest and most tentative. She gave us lots of great suggestions. For our entrees we had the pork tacos and the Thai peanut chicken. I found the tacos to be delicious and they came with fries (or frites). The Thai peanut chicken had a bit of a kick to it which holly warned us about. She recommend we have the chef leave the sriracha drizzle over the top of the dish off. We was good for us but definitely still had a kick. When our meal was done Holly asked if we were going to go downstairs to check out the Speakeasy. We hadn't known about it but took her suggestion to try it out. It's open on Fridays and Saturdays. To get down there you have to find the correct book in the bookshelf for the door to open to the downstairs. Once downstairs the owner Dave is a hoot and makes every drink personally for you. There is no drink menu down there. It was a lot of fun!!!"}
{"text":"Last night I attended a charity networking event down in the Speakeasy at Charlie's On Main. This was my first time at Charlie's and I loved every minute of it. Let me start off with, if you have not been to Charlie's On Main, you should check it out. 

Now let me tell you about the underground Speakeasy. You will feel like a secret agent or spy, entering the Speakeasy. To access the lounge/bar area downstairs you need to locate the \"special\" book on a bookcase for the hidden door. Once you found the book, and pull it back the door opens and leads to a hidden stairway down to lounge. 

The lounge was darker, but had enough light given the space was in the basement/lower level. The bar was lit up, and there was plenty of comfortable seating options including couches. Some of the tables were old whiskey barrels if you preferred to stand. 

I had the opportunity to meet the owner/chef Dave, who was very friendly and made sure the charity event went smoothly. The appetizers and craft cocktails were on point. I am looking forward to coming back and trying an entrée off the menu. 

I also recommend contacting Charlie's On Main if you are looking for a venue to host a party or gathering. They have 3 different spaces for different sized parties."}
{"text":"My first visit to Charlie's had some hiccups. The dining room/bar is warm and welcoming. The welcome soon wore off when I sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes unacknowledged. It appeared one of the bartenders was relatively new and while she glanced my way, she never engaged me. The more veteran bartender finally did and offered up the drink and food menu. The menu claims to be seasonally influenced and appears to be as the menu listed on their website was not the one offered up to me when I sat down. I appreciate that they strive to locally source their ingredients and as I wasn't that hungry, opted for the mushroom bisque and a side of frites. The bisque was very good. Perfectly seasoned and sunflower shoots help bite through the rich creaminess. The frites, however, were a miss. I like that they were handcut but they missed the mark as the lacked the crispy exterior that true frites have. Why the curried ketchup was almost chunky is also mystery. 
One thing I inquired about but did not order was the cheese board. There were only two featured-a 3 yr Hooks and a Farmer John's camembert. Two cheeses is weak and there is no excuse to have a more wider selection. 

They have some work to do. With that said, they have potential and I will be back to update my review."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere were amazing and the underground speakeasy was the most fun I've had in a long time...a big thank you to Big Dave for all the birthday fun"}
{"text":"We came with out-of-town guests and had a wonderful meal. Drinks were plentiful as was the dessert servings.  We had a New York strip, shrimp and grits, salmon risotto, bacon mac & cheese, And a burger. We definitely appreciate the gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with  Charlie's  on main. Went early on a Saturday night because they only take reservations for 8 or more. Got a table right away by the time we left probably 4 groups waiting for tables. Service was excellent  I had the steak sandwich kid got cheeseburgers as big as I've ever seen on a kids menu hubby got the shrimp scampi waitress ask if he liked spicy food because they put chillies in it he Does. We started off with the happy hour cheese curds half the normal size but only 2$ instead of 8$ so we got 2 excellent  curds lighter batter then most places. Hubby got a small ceaser salad which he said was very good. Didn't wait to long after for entrees my sandwich was excellent kid lovedd their burgers Hubby loved his scampi 6 large shrimp and the chilled added a nice zip. 2 good stiff cocktails 58 $ before  tip will definitely be returning again"}
{"text":"We came in about 6 pm on a Friday, expecting a wait. There was a seat yourself sign so we grabbed a table on the booth wall (we are same side sitters). There were perhaps 5 other parties sitting down at tables and 4 at the bar. Took about 10 minutes for server to arrive and it became apparent he was it for all the tables, which was fine as it wasn't super busy. We ordered drinks and put in an order for tomato bruschetta. During this time another 3 or 4 parties arrived. There was also a wedding in the main dining area that may have been sucking up staff. At one point a server asked a couple to move over tables to fit a larger group (6 or 8 maybe) which I couldn't believe. Hope they had their meal comped. 
The bruschetta arrived and it was underwhelming. Grape tomatoes halved with a pesto spread on not fully baked bread. 2/5 on that one. A bit salty actually. 
Server arrived again and we ordered entrees and more drinks. We are nearly an hour in at this point! As we we were waiting the place started to get packed. Apparently people in Oregon eat later? It was almost 7:30. Out entrees finally arrived after 45 minutes and were pretty good. My fish fry was decent, good breading on the perch, fries were good but cole slaw was bland. I like a nice vinegar flavor and it wasn't there at all. Wife had shrimp and grits, also very good but a tad salty. (4/5) on main course. 
At this point the place was packed in and we were just trying to turn the table over ASAP. One bartender turned server to handle the overload. Still way understaffed on a Friday night. Once we got the bill we paid and took off so more business could come in. Will hesitate to come back. They're better than the old place that used to be here but need some tweaking. If you have a large event in the main space (who kept spilling over to bar side and taking up tables/bar space, you should let customers know on arrival. 
I hope you get things figured out as we wouldn't mind giving it another try after a while. Thanks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times.  We like the food in general, but the salt level is either to much or too little on some items.  Regardless, the ambiance is great, servers are friendly, and it's a great place to have in a small town.  It feels a little like going to Coopers Tavern, and given some time, I think they will have the same consistency and quality."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to stop in for dinner after grabbing a drink earlier.  The food was excellent as was the service. My girlfriend has gluten and dairy allergies, but that was no problem at Charlie's.  
The waitress apparently apologized for slowness even though we didn't think it was an issue.  She even offered up a piece of flourless chocolate cake for dessert which was great!  I will definitely eat there again.  I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"We have been to Charlie's on Main many times. Tonight we had one of the best experiences. Alyssa was our bartender. She said she was filling in. I really wish she was a full time bartender there or bar manager! Alyssa was very efficient and made the best drinks! We also ordered food at the bar and she was just on top of it all along with a great personality! Best Cosmo ever and Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"I've been to Charlie's On Main quite a few times now... My first experience being my very first Yelp event in Madison! 

Since that first time, Charlie's has been on my list for bringing out-of-town guests who I know will just love seeing the speakeasy door open and really appreciate the cocktails. I don't think I've ever ordered something I didn't like, although I can't recommend anything that will knock your socks off. I have had several times when the kitchen was out of a particular ingredient or dish(es), which can be disappointing.

One of the things that I really like about Charlie's is the full vegetarian/vegan menu that they offer. It makes it really easy for people who want a veggie option to make a choice knowing exactly what they're going to get. 

The last time I was there, I ordered chocolate cake for dessert and asked if I could have ice cream on top. Holly, our server, actually grabbed her wallet and walked next door (despite my protests!) to get ice cream to serve with the cake. This is the kind of extra service you'll get at Charlie's that I really enjoy."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! Their lamb burger is amazing! It has a light cucumber sauce that will blow your mind. The drinks are varied and it has a literal secret passage to a speak easy. Check out the book shelf and peek at The Long Thirst ;)"}
{"text":"We decided to try takeout tonight and chose Charlie's since it's very GF friendly (which is a dietary requirement for my son). At first glance the menu looked great. Not too large, quality locally sourced ingredients, and every item either already was or could be made gluten free. The staff I spoke to over the phone and in person was friendly. The restaurant itself was charming and appeared clean. At first glance, this place really checked all of the boxes. 
Once we actually got our food home and sat down to eat however, things took a turn. First of all, I ordered the Charlie Burger, medium well with no mayo and no onion. I not only got a hefty serving a mayo and large piece of onion, but my burger was practically raw. I still tried to eat it and the patty was extremely tough. Being that it was extremely undercooked it should've at least been tender and juicy. The only reason that seems to account for the tough, underdone patty was that it must not have been fresh, but frozen instead. Disappointing to say the least. We ordered the kids fish for my son and it was ok. Bland, only one piece of perch and tons of fries. The fries had good flavor but we wished they'd been crispier. Personal preference so I won't ding them for that. My husband got the fish fry since he loves perch and was sorely disappointed by the three tiny pieces (especially for the price). We paid $36 for our meal which didn't include any drinks. For the quality of the product we received it was definitely not worth it. It's a shame too since there aren't many places with such a GF friendly menu."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. It has a long list of old-fashioned recipes, awesome appetizers, and the best mac n cheese and pulled pork tacos! We will have to come back for the speak easy. Great atmosphere too!"}

1) SUPER gluten free friendly
2) friendly service
3) good food

So glad we found this little gem!! We visited during summer restaurant week 2016, and we highly recommend visiting Charlie's during restaurant week. The portions are very generous so you are definitely getting your RW money's worth. 

Basically everything on their menu can be made gluten free, and I mean EVERYTHING. Even cheese curds (they use tapioca flour)! The cheese curds were AWESOME, not to mention the only place I have had deep fried gluten free cheese curds outside of my own kitchen. I tried the watermelon bruschetta which came on gluten free bread, the shepards pie (naturally g free as this has a potato crust), and the gluten free chocolate torte. The torte had a super rich, buttery crust. Everything tasted awesome. 

Service was friendly! The ambiance is cute, there is a big bar and it was not busy at all when we went. Granted it was a week night, but I would have expected it to be busier during RW.

This place is definitely worth a trip out to Oregon if you live DT and should become a regular spot if you live in Oregon. Glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Sad but true. Understaffed by 100%. 16 years of restaurant management- table next to us had entire bill comped. Sad. 3 front of house employees were working a feverish pace- 1 server for 20 ish tables- bartender trying, and I think the manager scrambling - but there should have been 6 in front. We would have doubled our drink tab alone had anyone had time to tap a beer.

Our food was very good as expected. But wow- no one working. Anyone who knows David- please pass this along . We want to return. But I will never suffer such slow (understaffed) service again. Anywhere.

We tipped our waiter well- not his fault."}
