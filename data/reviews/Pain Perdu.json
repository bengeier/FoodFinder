{"text":"So good! Cafe au Lait! Magnifique!   Thank goodness this place exists."}
{"text":"The only brunch/breakfast place in Toronto that creates a culinary experience second only to some caf√© in a sleepy old French town south of Bordeaux. Magnifique!"}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate in toronto, we shared  pain perdu and took pain chocolat, croissant and almond pain chocolat and almond croissant, we got full for the day :)"}
{"text":"I have alway loved Pain Perdu, but recently they renovated and I'm afraid it may be new owners. The chocolate croissants have ALWAYS been the BEST in the city BUT the chocolate croissant no longer has real dark chocolate, instead it seems to be some sort of pudding like paste? They are also no longer doing the amazing deserts - like lemon curd tart. What is happening? Last time I was in there was also no longer any french music playing either.   I was told they do the croissants for The Common on College (which does have the BEST coffee in TO) so maybe they are just mass producing the croissant for other coffee shops now - I'm not sure.  I love this place as it was such an amazing, authentic french cafe. My son is in french immersion so I like to take him there to get a bit of fresh culture in Toronto. Please tell me it's not over..."}
{"text":"honestly, this joint is over rated, especially the pastries. the baguettes are way overpriced. i spent the last 5 years in St Maur, and travelling France and this is simply average"}
{"text":"I have dined here for years with my mother & sister. We still cannot get enough of their infamous raisin-rich Jocelyn croissants and have fun getting them for other friends & family-- watching their reactions to having a piece of God in their mouths. Even people who detest raisins are blown away by the sheer number & exceptional quality of the black beauties. Jocelyn has gorgeous delicate flaky layers, an addictive crispiness of the outermost shell & a buttery fresh-baked chewy goodness within. The wonderful cascading effect & array of divine flavours and textures make your molars & taste buds euphoric with glee. They would dance pirouettes if they could. We also enjoy their pleasantly bitter yet fairly robust coffee and try to come here on weekends/holidays/everyone's days off. I wonder if some of us have lied to our bosses to come here. Wouldn't be surprised. Eh heh heh."}
{"text":"Overpriced croissant. Strollers are not allowed inside even if you just want to buy something to go. Service is rude. You can be ignored for quite a while before ordering anything. Maybe it's one time experience. But it's bad enough to prevent me from going there again"}
{"text":"Newly opened late April 2014.  A new owner took over space where Steak Frites was and kept the same phone number and much of the same decor.  Not to be confused with Pain Perdu on St Clair Ave.    AMBIANCE This bistro is a bit more casual than Steak Frites.  Jeans and a jacket are fine, but definitely not jeans and a T-shirt.  This is still upscale.  Classic bistro chairs, bar, and \"mosaic\" tiled floor.  I would not recommend bringing children here, unless they're over 7-8 years old and extremely well behaved.  It's too sophisticated.  Plan on a dining experience, so allow 1.5 to 2 hours to eat for a three course meal and good conversation.  It is not slow service or \"slow food movement\" per se, but well paced as it should be.  Given some of the classic food preparations, you need to allow this amount of time.    SERVER At least one of Steak Frites' top waiters stayed on (HOORAY!).  Career waiters who add to the dining experience are hard to find.  So you can be assured that you can bring an important client or date here and be in good hands.    Select a couple of wines and trust the servers' recommendation.  Good offerings BTW.  This is a wine type of restaurant, but you can get beer or spirits from a full bar.  MEAL SERVICES OFFERED Don't let the translation for Pain Perdu (French Toast) fool you.  They do an elegant dinner just as much as they do an elegant brunch and lunch.  TV There is one flat screen TV by the entrance/bar where 3-4 tables might be able to view it if you just can't miss that hockey game.  It is not intrusive, though.  WASHROOMS Downstairs, low ceilings.  Not handicap accessible in my opinion, but most washrooms are like this in the old buildings on Yonge St along this stretch.  PARKING Not great adjacent options.   Park on east side of Yonge St one block up, just north of Ranleigh.  There is not much is the way of side street parking for more than an hour on either Ranleigh or Wanless Avenues.  Plus there is massive subway construction where Wanless Ave connects to Yonge St that may last until 2016 I think I heard.   You can easily drop someone off at the curb, though.   Closest Green P parking way across the street on west side of Yonge St via Metro grocery store's parking lot (FURTHEST BACK /WEST of 3 parking areas accessible; make sure you park all the way back since Metro has a security guard); you can also access this parking area off of the south side Bedford Park Avenue, where it is a bit more obvious.   There is also Green P several blocks up off of Glenforest Rd behind the pet store off the east side of Yonge St.  PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION Just 3 or 4 doors south of the Ranleigh/North exit for the Lawrence Station (Yonge Line)."}
{"text":"Small and charming place that always smells terrific.  The coffee is good (not great, but very drinkable). My wife always goes for whatever kind of quiche they have going that day while I can't resist their croissants... almond and almond/chocolate are my favourite.  The service is always very pleasant. I always enjoy going there."}
{"text":"Gain a few pounds here because it hard not to devour all the buttery flaky pastry, danish and crossiant. Croque monseiur yummy, chessy and crisp. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place as I wanted to get my husband some croissants and other flaky treats for his birthday as he's not a fan of cake but loves a good croissant.  I called ahead to confirm open until 6, and rushed here after work one day.  When I arrived it smelled wonderfully of butter in the air and I was looking forward to grabbing a few things.  I was there around 5:30 which was plenty of time before closing.  I ordered a few treats to go and then because I was starving I ordered a quiche to eat.  I was informed that it's only take out from 5:00 - 6:00 and I would have to take the quiche to go.  I said sure... Assuming I could still have the quiche warmed with a fork to enjoy.  Apparently \"to go\" means you take it as is and I had to ask for a fork.  Feeling a bit confused and foolish I left.  There were no other customers in the place and I would have wolfed down that quiche in 15 minutes or less, so it seemed a bit odd to me.  I spent around $30 on the handful of pastries and a slice of quiche and left.  I ended up finding a Mexican restaurant nearby to have a proper dinner since I was still hungry.   Customer service for me is huge... And I didn't feel I received it here."}
{"text":"Pain Perdu  Bistro offers an amazing dining experience. Luxuriate in classic, authentic  French cuisine and a great wine selection. The  Incredible art collection makes the ambiance even more engaging.  What a great place to have an amazing meal, great conversations in a nice, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ya, it's friggin awesome.... if you've gone to Paris and had the baked goods and sandwiches and came back to Toronto looking for the same here... keep looking! :)  Honestly, it's not the same, but it's damn close and much better compared to the other self-proclaimed patisseries and boulanger's in Toronto.  Ham and Swiss are made to order - awesome!"}
{"text":"The. Best. Croissants. Ever. They were buttery and flaky and super fresh. The place was packed so go early for the best selection. The chocolate croissant are also very good. I have yet to have a croissant that tops theirs."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants, on par with Europe.. Always a dependable delight each Saturday morning...ignore the other review calling them \"lard\" and then suggesting to go across the street to the scone place as an alternative. That's clearly someone who works there."}
{"text":"I showed up one Saturday 15mins before closing wearing construction clothes. They were friendly, informative, and (perhaps because it was the end of day) they even threw in 3 additional pastries for free with my order.   I've tried 4 items thus far and as far as the quality is concerned, in true french fashion its very rich and delicious. Also, the ambiance is warm and cozy.   while other pastries shops may offer something different, very few if any can claim to offer anything better in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Pain Perdu has a good chocolate croissant. They have a table and seat, so it is nice to have a cup of coffee and croissant with friends. Other pastries are expensive and they are not fresh. I am not impressed with their pastries. They do not show the price for pastries. Inside Pain Perdu, it was dark. When I was there in the last summer, they did not have an air conditioner and it was very hot and dark."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch. The ham and cheese croissant (me) and the spinach quiche (wife), were excellent. The cafe au lait fell flat....should have spoken up as they would have given it an extra shot (they were very generous and did not charge for them). Great place, food and service."}
{"text":"Having recently come back from a visit to Paris and having heard about Pain Perdu for some time, we were anxious to try it out. Finally made it there today and yes - the croque monsieur was excellent, staff was very pleasant, but the thing we were hoping to find, was a proper french baguette in Toronto.  We kept hearing that Pain Perdu imported the flour (type 55) from France and so it was the \"real thing\" but wow - we were so disappointed with our baguette. Ace bakery, which we always thought was mediocre, we feel is better than what we bought at Pain Perdu.  Theirs is definitely NOT what we bought and ate in Paris (at a proper boulangerie) - nothing like it at all. So sad, we had really hoped to be able to get a good proper french baguette but it was not to be. Not the right consistency, crust really odd and no flavour! So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Am I only one who finds the service here to be terrible as of late?   I remember the days when the French staff were efficient but friendly. French music was playing and you felt like you really were somewhere else, maybe France or somewhere in Quebec.   Now every time I go I am met with a brash non-French** woman who can't even give you her attention for long enough to say 'I'll have a cappuccino with a pain au chocolate\" before she gives you an annoyed look of impatience.  Every time we order table service, she literally begins to walk away or cut you off before you can even finish. This is not a one time experience, and I have observed her being rude to many other customers and co-workers over and over again.   And then yesterday amongst the overt disinterest and and obvious distaste for having to work on Thanksgiving, she is coyingly sweet to a particular table that were clearly her friends or family.  Or perhaps they were customers that somehow won her over.  I haven't been able to and believe you me, I have tried.  She's just far too busy cutting you off mid-sentence.   I consider myself to be patient and friendly and open to to the fact that none of us are strangers to having just a plain-old-bad-f*cking-day.  But when it happens over and over, its clear that its not just a bad day, but a bad attitude - and this is a SERVICE based business.  This woman does not enjoy her job and it shows.  She can't handle stress and it shows.  And for me, it takes away from the experience that I assume the owners of Pain Perdu expect that they are providing for their customers.   The food is good, as the other reviewers have said.  And in theory, the place is sweet and perfect for a Sunday.  I just wish I didn't have to take it off my go-to list now.  **The only reason I say 'non-French woman' is so that you fellow Yelpers can identify her when in there, as I don't know her name."}
{"text":"This is a small, cozy place to have a cafe au lait and a croissant. It smells delicious at Pain Perdu and the pastries are delicious. The croissants are buttery and flaky and remind me of what I'd eat in Paris. If there's no room to sit and eat make sure you grab some pastries to go!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out a second time and found the server with the brown hair to be just as rude. I waited patiently in line behind three people only to have her tell me the lady behind me was next and the lady said she was when she knew she was. Then I walked toward the door and she said fine I'll take your order since you're here (rolled eyes reaching across counter) and then I said my order was for here and she said \"well you're supposed to sit down!\" Found it to be rude and embarrassing since the place was crowded so I didn't know if I should sit down or not. Sand which on croissant with ham and cheese was sloppy and cold"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been here before.  This place speaks \"Mel C.\"!  Not only does it meet my \"open early on Sunday\" requirement, the Pain Perdu is the best thing I've ever eaten for brunch!  Love the d√©cor/ambience of this quaint caf√©.  Service was fantastic.  I even got some goodies to go (various croissants) and they were all amazingly good.  Keep in mind I've had croissants in Paris, so I feel very qualified*.  Make sure you get there early enough to get some Pain Perdu.  Once they're sold out for the day, that's it!  *not officially qualified"}
{"text":"Best croissant and patisserie in general , i personally love this small bakery . Totally suggest you all yo grab something here . Good coffee also!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with what I love about this place. For me, it reminds me of those charming little bakery/cafes sprinkled across Montreal. Really, you can just step into Pain Perdu , order some pastry and a cafe au lait, sit back and pretend you just took the VIA train from Toronto to Montreal. To make the experience even more believable all the staff are French and even the radio is tuned to a French station. It's all there to be soaked in, right on St. Clair Ave W., Montreal here I come.  OK, about the croissants...They are really good. In my top three for Toronto assuredly. I'll have to go back to try out their other offerings. As for the coffee well...It's OK but not the greatest. Perhaps I was underwhelmed as I had briefly stopped at Cafe Noir for a delicious espresso shot before coming to Pain Perdu.  As I mentioned, I need to go back and try more of their food and pastries to give a proper review. One thing I did notice that was rather odd was the fact that their croque-monsieur is prepared ahead of time and then rewarmed to serve. Literally I see a stack of them behind the counter glass, already cooked, just...Sitting their looking most unappetizing. For a place that specializes in fresh baked bread I find it strange that they wouldn't make the croque-monsieur to order.  As for service it is quite good, very attentive.  I'm giving the place 3 stars for now and will update my review upon subsequent visits.   Worth noting is if you are on the hunt for foie gras they got it."}
{"text":"A very cute place that feels authentic French that even plays French music in the background!  The Croque Monsouir sandwich, which is a grilled ham sandwich with cheese melted on top is great.  The mocha coffee is so tasty, I highly recommend this with the whipped cream.  The almond crossoint is made well, it's fluffy, tender yet crisp with great flavour.  Overall a faboulous place to eat lunch or just to go on a date too."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love the croissants and lunch food. Gateau Basque dessert (weekends only) is the best! also recommend the weekend bread with dates and nuts. Best coffee in the area"}
{"text":"My exposure to pain perdu was due to the reputation they have for their croissants.  So while on a espresso crawl in the vicinity , when we couldn't find a suitable dessert we decided to to give this place try.  Just to give an idea the setup is very tight and most tables are just packed together. (they even had a sign asking people to leave their strollers outside)  Service was below average on this visit as we had to chase the server to get our order in.  My friend ordered a chicken sandwich I went for their namesake dessert (added a croissant for good measures as I still recall it being very good.) The baguette was good for the sandwich, the meat itself was seasoned poorly. Now the main event for me at least Pain Perdu looked very nice covered with anglaise sauce and lots fresh fruit. However the taste left a lot to be desired. The sauce overwhelmed and egg soaked bread was quite dry and didn't have the eggy taste. This version is best left lost/forgotten.  The croissant is still good.  I would say 2 stars for the mains we ordered. With a half star bump for the still good croissant.;"}
{"text":"Went in on a friend's recommendation of \"best croissant in town\", and picked up a pain au chocolat and plain croissant to go.  Like a true North American I ate them while driving.  In a word:  Stale.    In more words:  Stale, small and expensive, almost $5 for the two.  I should have thought about the fact that there were so many croissants sitting there.  As far as I'm concerned the place should be called \"Customer Perdu\".  If you want a great croissant always fresh, go to Clafouti on Queen Street West."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of girls for a friends 26th. They don't take reservations, so we had to wait a little bit, but we got a good table. We came around 11ish because by this time it's already fairly busy. After my first time here, I can say i would definitely return. The food was great, particularly the Pain Perdu (I split it with a friend, as it is quite big, particularly if you are eating something else beforehand). I had the roast beef sandwich, which came on a baguette.   The service could definitely be refined. Despite having 6 people at the table, our server did not take notes, and had to ask everyone three times what we were having. The tea is also not great. They have red rose and some sort of english breakfast, I think Tetley. They don't even have Earl Grey. I would expect a nice cafe to have premium tea, but at least a mediocre brand would have been better. I ordered the coffee on the way out, and it was good!  The place is crammef, so strollers aren't allowed. The place gets busy and hectic inside, but if you don't mind, the food is worth it. They have sandwiches, quiches, croissants (I didn't try, but my friends loved them), and great dessert."}
{"text":"The eponymous pain perdu is great, the staff is super friendly, and the atmosphere is great. The only thing to be aware of is that it is almost always packed, so consider coming at less popular times if you want to be sure you'll get a spot--especially if you've got more than two in your party."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and classic french cuisine! Highly recommend the croque monsieur and the fresh pastries!"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmm  CROISSANTS!!!!!   Buttery flaky and you can't just eat one - so I grabbed a seat with a couple of friends and ordered a latte and another croissant and than moved onto the best onion tart I have ever had (outside of Paris)...   It was the last piece so I had to share ( the little selfish kid in me came out because I really did not want to).  Perfect balance of crust and onion and it is sweet and savoury and just yummy.  The place is small and cozy.   Haven't tried the quiche yet so I may have to visit again sometime very soon!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, small cafe feel. Marred by a brutish server/owner with a grizzly beard and noticeable paunch. Had the coffee and was waiting on the chicken and mushroom quiche with a salad. Waited about 10-15 minutes and it wasn't even busy. Finally the two items arrived in the same plate. Sampled the slightly warmed quiche - not bad, and was about to sample the salad when...damn...I noticed the dead fly on the plate. An immediate turn off! Like what on earth?! It is the beginning of March, so where did the fly come from? I of course pointed it out to the brutish server/owner. He said \"there are no flies in here\", not a sorry or anything of that nature. He said he would replace the dish. Yeah right, scrape away the fly, rearrange the lettuce and bring the same thing back. No thanks. We left with his fond words of \"we've got the best quiche in the city\". Maybe so, but Pain Perdu also has an unclean kitchen, and unaccountable service."}
{"text":"It was a gloomy Sunday morning, and man friend wanted nothing more than simple bread with butter and jam.  \"Isn't there anywhere that just has good break with butter and jam?\"  So we searched.  Of ccourse, the usuals popped up for \"best baguette in Toronto\" search, which I won't name.  What's this Pain Perdu?  Well, it's not that far, even though St. Clair has a billion traffic lights.    We decided to give it a try.  I wish my stomach was not already half stuffed with cereal, as I would have loved to try more.  Manfriend ordered the asparagus and salmon quiche, with salad, a latte, and I ordered the mushroom and onion tart, with a regular coffee.  We of course shared the baguette with butter and jam.  We were so impressed with the consistency of the quiche - it was light, fluffy, not overcooked, and not spongy.  Even if you don't like quiche, I would suggest you try and order this!  I would say it's  4.5 - 5!  I've heard of onion tarts before, so decided to go ahead and order this traditional pastry.  I was very happy with it, though I still eyed the quiche across the table...  OooooOOOohh!!  The latte came in a bowl and was delicious.  Though the drip coffee  I ordered with probably the most flavourful, most rich I've had in months (if you're in the neighbourhood, I don't know how you wouldn't make this your morning stop), I can't help but feel I lost out on my beverage choice against the man friend...again!  I don't like jam.  But I loved their strawberry home made jam (I think it was strawberry).  It was thick, not gelatinous like the jar ones, and it was sooo tasty...  We also left with pate, an olive loaf, a croissant and pain au choc....  I took one star off because our original search was the best baguette, and though everything else excelled, the baguette didn't win me over.  I'm coming back here again next month :)"}
{"text":"Super adorable French style cafe. It's small so don't assume you'll get a table on a Saturday or Sunday morning but if you do, embrace it! The coffee is great here and the breakfast quiche was perfectly made. The croissants looked amazing as I saw several customers take one to go. Next time I'll follow the masses."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite tradition  - I pay homage every time I visit Toronto. Patisseries like this just do not exist anymore - a pastry art that is far and few! Butter croissants, almond croissants, french almond custard tarts and windows of endless quiche - try the onion & bacon or the roquefort....COMPLETEMENT EXCEPTIONNEL!! In my travels, I search for comparable pastry but I am secretly proud that nothing compares. Get here early so you can have your choice of goodies. I love the small, quaint feel of only hearing French spoken over coffee and a newspaper. I am told the Pain Perdu is all low-calorie ha ha ha!! and worth every little bit!! Ah such a blessing to visit every time - A BIENTOT!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot until I discovered so many other cafes that are way better.  The service has always been poor, but i would usually put up with it because their quiches are really good and I love their warm goat cheese salad. I even came back after finding a big worm in my salad! But their croissants taste like lard and are often stale and dry.  Their coffee is nothing to write home about, but it isn't the worst. The worst thing about this place though, is that it is super overpriced. I would end up paying 40 bucks for two person breakfast of quiche and coffee.... anyways.... That plus the lame service finally turned me off for good. I started checking out the Baker and Scone across the street, which is clean, fresh and has welcoming staff.   Save yourself a crapload of money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Authentic 'old' cafe vibe, delicious croissants and quiche, and good strong espresso. The freshly baked bread is my favourite thing to get here: sourdough olive or dried fruit & walnut on the weekends. Yum!   One minor drawback to this place is that it's tiny and dark (not much sunlight) so it's definitely not a place to chill out on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Pain perdu is one of Toronto's hidden gems, a little bakery / restaurant tucked away between generic stores and if you blink you miss it. This is as close to an authentic french food as you can get, I love the quiches, they are so fluffy, airy and delicious, the pastries are outstanding, made with lots of butter (as they should) and really everything is good here. The only drawback i have is the average coffee and the very tight space. If you like french pastries this is for you (just bring coffee from mcdonalds next door)"}
{"text":"Stopped in after my 30th birthday brunch to check out the place (I have lived in this hood for 4 years, but never went in here, always wanted to!) and ended up ordering a croissant with a side of homemade raspberry jam and custard filled pastry to go.  The shop keep was super sweet and gifted me incredible pommiers after my silly BF told her it was my birthday. D'aw! You shouldn't have!  Loved the service and the pastries were absolutely incredible. Can't wait to come back to enjoy a treat and coffee in this really cute little shop. It is a bit pricey, but worth it, IMO.  Try their housemade jam, it is redonkulously delish!!"}
{"text":"A decent coffee....very attentive service and a buttery cinnamon roll. You can't ask for anything more. A very french atmosphere. Pleasant and we will be back to sample more items."}
{"text":"butter croissant nothing special, the woman server'd better change the attitude."}
{"text":"Not just a place to eat but an experience. It is a spot for local regulars but it never gets too busy which makes me think it doesn't have city-wide exposure. It actually makes you feel like you are in France, a lot of the staff are French themselves adding to the authenticity. The music is also French as well. Their coffee is one of the top coffees I've had in Toronto. The pastries, quiches and sandwiches are amazing as well. They make their own jam and mustard in house which are to die for. Good place for a breakfast or lunch, or even dessert. Their namesake the 'pain perdu' (French toast) is amazing and authentic. Prices are very reasonable but not cheap. However, much cheaper than flying  to Paris, so definitely the perfect place to get away or for a romantic rendezvous. The service is always great. No reservations (just a bakery with seating) and not a lot of space so would not recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"French food made with love!   I feel like I've popped into a Parisian  bistro. The food is fantastic.   Fois Gras with fresh home made brioche onion soup. Atmosphere is modern French bistro, lovely new spot to enjoy wonderful food with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Aaaahhh Pain Perdu, I love it!!! I love their almond croissant and their butter croissant.. Nice place to relax with a newspaper and a coffee/tea. I'm not a fan of hot chocolate but when I tried theirs, and my faVourite, Croque monsieur- I'm so lovin' it!!! A Bientot Pain Perdu!!"}
{"text":"Butter!!! Yum. It's hard to believe how much I enjoyed quiche, it was unlike any I have ever had before. The crust was flaky and the filling was wonderful. The onion tart dessert was also very French; I love butter and if you do I would highly recommend Pain Perdu. Too bad duck confit was all sold out already.  [my husband wrote this.]"}
{"text":"Some of the best baked goods ANYWHERE. I am here almost every weekend. The quiche is excellent. The croissants...I want to be buried in one of them when I go. Oh my God, it's the second best buttery experience I've ever had (I really can't mention the first in this review). The staff is friendly and attentive. I love it. From coffee to croissants, from soup to croque monsieur it is a wonderful cafe experience. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The coffee is not as good... what happened? And the servers don't seem to notice. When we ask for a second, it's just as bad as the first, so we give up. Also, when we ask for a double espresso we get a cappuccino; when we ask for a cappuccino we get a latte...."}
{"text":"We took Mom there for her Birthday tonight.  Everyone loved it.  Service was friendly and attentive and every dish was done perfectly! Between us (we were a group of six) we ordered almost half the menu.  The steaks and lamb were delicious, fish was good.  moules were terrific...  Everything you'd want in a French Bistro.  And of course the bread and desserts were outstanding! Biggest (pleasant) surprise was the reasonably priced wine list! This is definitely going to become a neighbourhood fav!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, just wonderful.  An unpretentious french cafe settled in the middle of St. Clair West. The venue is small and seats maybe 15 at most. With fresh baguettes, pastries and great coffee, this will bring back memories of France for anyone.  Order an Espresso and Almond Crossaint and take a seat facing St. Clair on a bright Saturday morning (they open at 8am here). Do some people watching, take in the fresh pastries being baked, take your time .. and relax.  When you're done. Take the cities best Mille-feuille to go (or well, any pastry :-)) and share with a loved one.  The staff are wonderful and always have a smile, and I am a sucker for the accent."}
{"text":"the coffee was excellent but the croissant was okay.  the space for this place is pretty small but very warming.  the service was good as well."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch frequently, even though this is more of a cafe/bakery than a brunch place (no fried eggs/hash browns etc at this place). But they have a lovely selection of sandwiches and quiches, and some other meaty stuff, but I don't pay attention to that.  The seating is limited and this place has a very cozy feel. The staff are very friendly and nice.   I super love their quiches and I'm really digging bibb lettuce these days, so I usually get their side salad as well. Simple but delicious.   Great coffee and pastries as well.   Tip: you won't be brought a bill, you just go to the register when ready to pay."}
{"text":"Shhh! Don't tell anyone, but this is my secret place for early Saturday morning French breakfast. Yes, I come here to feel a little closer to France, read the newspaper, hear French chatter, enjoy the pastry.  Here croissants and especially pain au chocolat are as close to the ones you can get in Paris. And if your waist can afford extra two inches or so, make sure to order hot chocolate with whipped cream on it. It is the real stuff, not from the can, beaten by hand....mmm tres savoureux! Pick up some bread when you leave, you won't regret it, well may be your dietitian will."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, good quiche, decent baked goods, yucky bread."}
{"text":"Between this place and the Stockyards it's a wonder that I don't weigh 300lbs.   The croissant are all very good - the plain and the Jocelyn (maple and raisin) are my go-to-girls. I try not to think of how much butter was sacrificed for the cause. The pain perdu, which is the French toast, made with egg bread and topped with creme anglaise is sinful. The croque monsieur is satisfying as well.   There tends to be a crowded jumble of takeout and eat-in customers on weekends who inevitably need to pay all the same time in the tiny space which means I stand at the counter wistfully trying to catch the eye of someone behind the counter while all four staff bustle around getting orders for the sit down customers wow this sentence is a crowded jumble.    Depending on the croissant style, four of them will set you back about $9.  Yes, you can get cheap croissant by the clamshell at your local grocery store but you won't want to call them croissant once you have Pain Perdu."}
{"text":"Quaint french bakery and cafe!  We were walking along St. Clair looking for a brunch spot to help warm up from the cold. As we neared the location, we noticed a steady stream of people entering and leaving so we thought something must be good. We popped inside to the delight of the smell of freshly baked bread and pasteries. Inside, the cafe is quite small and cramped - there are about 3 tables in front, 2 on the side and more seating for 8 people at the back. The highlight is definitely the counter where can salivate over the croissants and quiches. We managed to grab a table and the server told us the menu is written on the wall.   Food wise, the menu serves simple french sandwiches, quiches and a couple of traditional french dishes like duck confit. We settled on a croquet monsieur and tomato+onion quiche with tea. Food took a bit longer than I expected but we were pleasantly rewarded with a giant sandwich and quiche. For the sandwich, it had lots of gooey cheese on top hand a big slice of bread. Taste was good but I found it to be a bit greasy. The quiche is definitely the winner of the two - lots of toppings in the egg with a nice crust. This was supported by a ton of people coming in to buy the whole quiche as take out!   Overall, food was good but space was a bit cramped and service a bit slower. We will come back to check out the baked goods next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pain Perdu!! I wish there is a French bakery like that in my hood!!   Open daily from 8 AM - 6 PM... it is a great place to grab some croissants, a coffee.. and meet up with your buddy.   When I walked into this little place.. the first thing I smell were butter, carbs and baked goods!! This is the prove that they do prepare their pastries and bread on site.. The smell was so intense... and so delicious and yes I am sold!   Almond Croissant ($ 2.40)  - I really admiring and smelling my croissant before I bite into it.. it looks so perfect.. glossy looking (thanks real butter), firm...and unreal!  - hmmm and I have to tell you it tasted better than it looks!  - flaky all over... not doughy at all.. (thanks real butter)   Raisins Croissant ($2.80)  - At first I thought those were chocolate bits on top... but no.. those are raisins.. Sorry I just cannot eat raisins.. but if you love it.. you will be delighted because wait till you have a bite.. there are tons and tons of raisins inside..  - My friend like raisins.. I should have force her to get chocolate so at least I can try that!   Cafe Mocha ($3.50)  - So pretty... decorated with a little strawberry on the side  - Tell me those are not whipped cream on top! My friend really enjoyed that.. but I think that is just too too fattening for me! and I bet you that 2% milk is NOT used!   Cappuccino ($2.99)  - Good strong roast...and went well with my croissant!   Pain Perdu is such a cute little place... yes so French and so cozy and so warm and so fattening!! But eating here worth every calories and fat content!"}
{"text":"CROISSANT REVIEW. Yep, still my favourite croissant.  A couple of things I didn't include in my first review, which are more apparent after having sampled many croissants: - solid outside structure, not soft - its on the well done side (which I like) - the thing is flaky.  Pleasant texture but its not good walk-around hand food because you can get flakes all over yourself. - its a little bready in the middle but very flaky around the outside (I'm thinking this is about as flaky as a croissant can get) - the flavour is not as distinctive as I remember but still a good amount of flavour."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch !!! Really fun staff if you like pastries and hot chocolate they probably have the best in the city, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but i guess it suits the  neighbourhood, also very cozy place to relax."}
