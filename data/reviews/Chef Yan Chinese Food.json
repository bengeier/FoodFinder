{"text":"Great Chinese food, only place I go to in Pickering."}
{"text":"A great hidden gem. This restaurant has great Chinese food at very reasonable prices. It's take-out and delivery only, so it's not suitable for those looking to dine-out. But if you just want to order some very good quality Chinese, they are a fantastic place to choose. The Cantonese Chow Mien is fantastic. The Jumbo Egg Rolls are incredible. A bit greasy, but possibly the best egg rolls I've ever had. The Sweet & Sour Chicken Balls are also great, and I'm generally not a big fan of Chicken Balls. This place is a hidden treasure in Pickering. The only downside is that they give very little condiments (soy sauce etc.), so if you want a decent amount, just ask for extra. But when trying the food without any condiments, I understood why - the food is fantastic without them, and I often use a ton of soya sauce, hot sauce etc. to add flavour to my Chinese food, but with Chef Yan, it's really not necessary at all. The food is delicious as is."}
{"text":"simply the best! I was looking for one of these mom and pops place since moving from Toronto. It's literally a whole on a wall. lol.  The food is delicious! the price is amazing! I always get a combo dinner for 1 and I think it's the best bang per buck! Lots of food for the price! No dine in, only delivery or pick up.   Order ahead to save time."}
