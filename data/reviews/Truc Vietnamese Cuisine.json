{"text":"Really great Pho here. The rice noodles combo dish is excellent too. Never had a bad dish here, been coming here for years. The atmosphere is sedate and there is tv musak allways on, often vietnamese variety shows."}
{"text":"I was a wee bit underwelmed when I visited this little Pho place in the well known \"Asian market with the bomb testing ground parking lot\" on tryon. The service was friendly and fast but no one really knew what was going on. THe Pho lacked the traditional light spice taste from anise or 5-spice. I mean this place was fine for a lunch where I was only there to fill my gut at the momment, most likely I will not be back.  We had started off the meal with fresh summer-rolls. Somewhat fresh but the dipping sauce tasted somewhat from a jar. Almost too sweet, and misleading with crushed peanuts on top. The other thing we ordered was the pho with the soft tendon, tripe, and rare steak, While it was a rather large order of pho it came with a miniscule plate of accopaniments. Barely enough basil for me, let alone my fiance! like I said the beef broth is very lightly flavored.  As for the service, they were fast, but the attention to detail was lacking. I ordered a boboa smoothie and it wasnt until after I recieved the beverage that I was informed that, \"We forgot to brew the Tapioca today.\" That is something you tell the patron before you give them a chalky smoothie without glorious tapioca pearls. THEN!!! the fact I wasn't comped for something that tasted like chalk and coldness with pineapple. Outrage! The saving grace was that The tripe and the soft tendon were perfect.  SOooo... anyother ideas for Pho in Charlotte that doesnt suck? I know this isn't Portland but come on!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service and good food.  The only downfall is that it's in a run down area, but the food is great. They have the best summer rolls in town. I go there for their Vietnamese pho, vermecilli salads and summer rolls. And of course their bubble tea are super yummy also!  If you love Vietnamse food you won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of authentic food then you'll fall in love with this place. Stumbled across this place and I'm glad I did. The Pho is packed with flavor and is second to none. I've been to a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants here in Charlotte and this is definitely tops on my list. If you happen to be in the area and authentic vietnamese is on your mind, stop in and give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem - excellent service, easy parking, QUALITY, DELICIOUS food 2 minutes away from NoDa.  Lang Van has nothing on these guys and I don't know why everyone keeps going there when this place exists.  I have had pretty much everything on their menu, last night I had the lemongrass beef vermicelli dish which was perfect.  The flavors were WONDERFUL, the noodles perfect and my friend had the lemongrass chicken dish with broken rice.    Do not be deceived by the parking lot that looks like giant craters.  Walk in and you will be helped.  Hope you share this with your friends so that more people experience this lovely place."}
{"text":"We were a bit dubious about this restaurant because of the location but boy were we happily surprised. It was a home run. I had a tofu dish and my fellow had the noodle soup and both were outstanding. It is worth a trip to this dowdy shopping center just to eat at Truc. And it was so cheap!"}
{"text":"Great pho, good prices! Gotta love the Asian Corner Mall. The bubble tea is good too. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was a really cute place with some really great food.  The traditional Vietnamese food is some of the best I've had.  Granted I haven't had very much experience with it, but still it was pretty darn good.  Plus they have bubble tea, along with many other varieties of exotic fruit drinks.  The food was very fresh and flavorful.  Their soups are really worth a try, even though they may sound questionable.  The service was excellent as well. They were attentive and fast and just made sure everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I LOVE Truc's pho. Their pho is BETTER THAN Pho Real (place for pho eating beginners), Pho Hoa, and Ben Thanh."}
{"text":"So delicious! Hubs and I got eggrolls, springrolls and the vermicelli bowls with the pork, porkpatty, eggrolls and shrimp with their sweet fish sauce. The pork was marinated so good and it was so flavorful. The woman who took our order was just the sweetest. I hate that we live an hour away! I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The traditional \"#1\" (bizarre how they don't list pho first on the menu like other places) had the usual everything - rare and well-cooked beef, chunky tendon, tripe, and a meatball in a beefy delicious broth.  The fried spring rolls were good, and the fish sauce was done right.  The Vietnamese iced coffee really hit the spot when going to work at crazy eastern times for this Californian.  All in all - a good pho meal.  Prices were a bit high for the pho, especially factoring in the suspension work, tires, exhaust, etc. needed after tearing up my lowered rice rocket in the parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is it. Traditional and family owned. Plenty of seating and a decently clean establishment. This is my 2nd time back, so revisits are expected. An ngon!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to give it a try since we were in the area. My husband had the bun bo hue, I tried the pho dac bet and my boys had the chicken wings. We also had 3 Thai tea and 1 Sprite. Everything was good except for the chicken wings. They were pink inside. The reason why I gave it a 3 star is because it took forever for us to received our drinks. Seems like there was only 1 older lady working. She was no where to be found. Then when we were all done with our food she comes to our table with 2 bubble tea which we didn't order.  Maybe if she would have wrote down the orders she wouldn't have forgot what we ordered. Or maybe they need more help. Whatever it is, we won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a run down strip. I was honestly shocked at my surrounding and debated if it was a safe area to be in. Not only that, I made a visit to the restroom and there were so many gnats in there. It made me question their cleanliness. (We did see that they got a 90. Not so bad but I wouldn't return again because of the food.) It's nothing special and I've had better. Eggrolls were not amazing to me and lacking in flavor. Their pho with all the fixings was a good size. They gave plenty of noodles and meat but their broth was only subpar. Points for food coming out hot; side veggies were also fresh. However, they took a long time to come back and refill drinks. This part never bothers me because I typically never finish my entire drink. It did bug my sister because she always drinks two-three glasses of water per meal. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd rather choose a different pho restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I loved it!  I also left my credit card there for a week without knowing I lost it and they kindly held it for me.  Trustworthy business. Delicious food."}
{"text":"On my first visit I got the com dac biet, which was excellent, though the pork pate was not to my taste. The second time, I got the lotus root salad and caramelized catfish. The former was good but the latter was incredible; it had an intense sweet and salty flavor that was different from anything I've had before. My companions ordered spring rolls, pho, and some vegetable tofu dishes, and seemed very happy with their orders, though I didn't get to try them.   This has to be the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The waitress/owner told us that \"I cook for Asians,\" and it certainly seems like compared to other local Vietnamese restaurants, Truc's menu is broader and more oriented toward Vietnamese rather than Asian tastes. They do have all the standard dishes like pho, com and bun thit nuong, but they also have lots of other stuff I'm not familiar with. I look forward to going back and trying other things."}
{"text":"If you just love driving into the worst part of town, through a parking lot that looks like Viet Nam AFTER the war, and not being greeted in ANY language, then you're already well on your way to loving this place. Don't worry, it's not that the waiters don't speak English - they do' they just could care less about you and your American needs. Besides, the menu is all a combination of stuff you'll find under your lawn mower and kinds of meat you're not sure where it came from, and in a watery broth.  Isn't being cool such fun? The food here is a bland and uninteresting combination of tastes you just don't consider returning for any time soon, until your next 'cool' friend suggests it. Time to get new friends."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Coming from San Diego and being Vietnamese myself, I am definitely spoiled with excellent Vietnamese food at every corner. And this restaurant was delicious! We ordered the special pho and special rice plate and we have nothing bad to say. Btw, their sate (chili pepper) is extremely hot so be careful not to put too much or you'll be chowing down water.  The outside decor could definitely use some work though. The building is run down and the outside itself looks very unsafe.   But we'll be back whenever we're in town for their delicious food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dish. They have more than just pho. I ordered Bun Bo Hue, and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"As everyone else has mentioned, this place is a hidden gem. Have reservations about the shady shopping center? Put them aside! The food was amazing. I had the meat combo spicy fried rice (yes, i went to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered fried rice, i wanted to try it) and it was amazingly tasty, addictive even. My wife had beef vermicelli, which she also loved and the small bite she let me have was quite tasty. Need your Asian fix but disappointed with Miyagi's in NoDa? Ya, me too, try Truc out."}
{"text":"Truc is absolutely incredible. Tried it once when we came to get Le's on a Wednesday (closed) and was blown away. Their Pho is fresh and bright and really delicious, but their Bun Ga Nuong (vermicelli with chicken) is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Every person at the table wished they had gotten it. Seriously, it's ridiculous how good it is. The owner is lovely too. Don't be put off by the looks of the shopping center. Truc is legit."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food. I've been to several Vietnamese restaurants around Charlotte and Truc is just like the rest of them. The scenery is tacky, but the food is exceptional. I got my favorite Vietnamese Dish, the Bun Dac Biet, and I was pleased with it. Not much I can say that I haven't said about the other Vietnamese spots in Charlotte. Not original, but still good."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came here on a Monday afternoon because most other Vietnamese or Thai places are closed on Monday. Hubby and I both had vermicelli, his with pork and mine with shrimp. All I can say is they are different than the regular Vietnamese vermicelli I had in NY or other major cities. The noodles are a lot thicker and the pork chop is marinated almost Chinese way. Oh we also had the summer roll for appetizer, which we always order whenever we go for Vietnamese. On the menu it says the summer roll contains shrimp and pork, but the one I ate didn't have shrimp and the pork is like a BBQ pork. It's not bad but it's just not your classic Vietnamese roll."}
{"text":"ordered the special/house chow fun...mediocre in taste and presentation btw. halfway thru the meal, found a piece of hair nestled into the meat/noodle combo. yuck. informed the waitress, she replied, well, i can take 50% off... since you ate most of it already. uhhh? even if i ate the meal entirely, i wouldnt have paid for it. but in the end, she kindly took off the chow fun portion from our check."}
{"text":"Had a very nice-tasting bowl of bun here -- thick noodles with good texture, generous portions of grilled meat, nice grilled flavor permeating everything.  Compared to some of the more familiar Vietnamese places in town the flavors are pretty unsubtle and strong.  We asked for fresh coconut juice and got giant glasses of delicious fresh-squeezed orange juice instead, but it was so good we didn't bother to try to correct the mistake.  The restaurant interior was somewhat downscale but seemed clean and pleasant enough, though the air conditioning could not keep up with the oppressive heat today.  The weird part of the place is, of course, braving the gigantic car-eating potholes at Asian Corners.  As an adventure bonus, we poked around the stinky, dim interior of the mall, finding a very authentic-looking Hong Kong BBQ place with a front window full of glistening roasted ducks on skewers, but little else open.  The whole scene up there is very postapocalyptic, like Asian Corners was re-established in the wake of a disaster that destroyed the infrastructure and man's capacity to fix it -- but hey, we can still cook tasty grilled meat in the ruins."}
{"text":"The best Bun Bo Hue you will ever have! The owners are from Hue, Vietnam! Authentic, flavorful, mouthwatering, satisfying! You will be please!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate here, I personally saw the worst customer service ever.  The table near us had a lady who was being real picky about the ingredients of some of the dishes.  After a few minutes of answering her, the owner rudely told her, \"this is not a 5-star restaurant.  This is a family restaurant.  If you don't want to eat here, you get out\".  Somehow or another, she stayed and placed her order. That pretty much left a bad taste in my mouth for an owner to bad-mouth a customer.  I guess he forgot who pays his bills.  I refuse to go back to an establishment where idiots think money falls from the skies and customers mean nothing to them."}
{"text":"Their lemon grass chicken was good but the service was so-so. Their pho was underwhelming as the meatball pieces were torn into small shreds that I could barely eat it and the beef was sliced into tiny pieces. The broth was ok. Overall, an A-OK meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to get some type of pho with tofu and veggies instead of beef, and they were very accommodating! The girlfriend got a tofu lemon grass which was delicious also....they were able to substitute the rice for some vermicelli for her.  We capped off the meal with a mango bubble tea, everyone's favorite Vietna...uh Taiwanese drink. It was probably made with powder, but it tasted pretty good nonetheless.  I would definitely hit up this place again next time I'm in Charlotte. (just don't let the decrepit shopping center throw you off!)"}
{"text":"Today is a sad day for Truc. A good friend of mine come here on the regular and always enjoy a good piping hot bowl of Pho. The Pho here is amazing. Well today was a different story when I found a dead bug floating in my soup. Mind you I am already working on my fourth or fifth scoop. I just happened to look down and there it was...a multi colored bug floating right against the edge of the bowl. I didn't flip out. I causally showed the owner...hey there is a bug floating in my soup. I should have taken a picture of it because she took the ladder of it and took to the kitchen. Mind you she never apologized. She said \"I don't know how that happened.\" I beg your darn pardon?? She then says \"oh we won't charge\". Thank you captain obvious. The crazy part about she still charges my friend. You could have given us both our money back because thank God I caught mine. I think it goes without saying that this hidden gem is a hidden nightmare. I'll take my chances with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld."}
{"text":"I was pretty set on hu tieu nam vang when I was on my way to Truc, but I saw that they had mi quang as a weekly special and since finding good mi quang has been a continuous quest for me during the last 3 years.  It wasn't bad, and did more of that bumrush all your senses deal that I've been craving than some places but still cannot capture the white whaleness of my dreams  Also, are wood ear mushrooms unavailable in Charlotte? I've ordered egg rolls 3 times and they never have them."}
{"text":"I ate at Lang Van twice before coming here.  This place is authentic.  I had the Bun Bo Hue. For those of you who eat that it did come with the tiet.  I had the goi cuon, bun bo hue and xi moui soda ( only it didn't come out as a soday- oh well).  Goi Cuon wasn't too big but the pork and shrimp was good.  There was a nice balance of herbs.    The Bun Bo Hue came out in a nice big bowl.  Lots of herbs, onions and meat.  I was surprise to find gan in my soup.  It usually get it with my pho but was pleasantly surprise.    I also had a durian shake to go.  Forgot to ask for the boba with it.    Wish I found this place earlier.  I could of had 3 great meals instead of 2 mediocre (Lang Van) and 1 great meal (Truc).    I took a star away for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been asking around to try new pho places and someone mentioned Truc and 3 other places & since Truc was closer to us, we decided to check it out.  Arrived there and there was one other group and us & that's about it. Maybe because it was 1.5 hour till closing, but it was very quiet.   The lady who took our orders spoke broken English, of course, but still very understandable. Ordered #7 pho in large at $9.50 and #30 of broken rice place with pork chop at $10.50. It didn't took long till our food arrived. Pho was delicious, but I didn't like my pork chop very much. It was dry and tasted a lot like fish sauce and reminded me of Chinese sausage for some reason, but I did try to eat as much as I can because it was expensive!!  So after eating part of my pork chop, I chow down my husband's bowl of pho as it was full of beef tendons. I love tendons and they gave us a lot.   Other than that, I don't think I will come back here other than for pho because we got a huge bowl of pho for $9.50. I think it's huge, lol."}
{"text":"Usually, my vegetarianism doesn't have much of an impact on me enjoying a restaurant (excluding steak houses and BBQ pits that, unwisely, don't have awesome hushpuppies or cornbread for me to stuff my face with). At Truc, it takes what could be an amazing, authentic experience, squeezes it through an ameri-chinese tube and onto my plate, which I sit sadly staring at, envious of other, far more interesting dishes and bowls being distributed to other diners.  There are 8 things to order from on this 100-item plus menu, if you don't eat the meat. They range from lo mein to chop suey to what I got, lemongrass tofu and hot peppers. I asked for very very spicy, and it got there very very spicy, bird's eye chili's abounding, which was rad, and bumped this review from 2 to 3 stars. Maybe I've just been spoiled by umpteen million choices at Lang Van and Ben Thanh... but the last thing I wanted when I came to Truc was boring Chinese, no matter how hot it was.  Fresh durian shake and a friend's cravings for bubble tea will bring me back, but I wish there were more here for me to eat. Ah well."}
{"text":"Love the pho here!  Everytime I goto Charlotte I stop in for lunch here.  Staff is nice.  Food is made swiftly and is always delicious.  Have never been let down!  Eat pho spicy... and sweat it out while eating.. thats how its supposed to be! pho even if its 100degrees out!  It cures everything! =)"}
{"text":"I got the pho - fully loaded:  meatballs - tightly packed salty nubs. well-cooked beef - slow cooked brisket, razor thin. rare beef - also thin, which cooks on contact with the hot broth tendon - cartillage like pieces, very flavorful tripe - cow stomach, sliced thin and very healthy also the standard rice noodles, onion, and tasty broth.  Sofa King Delicious!!!  Garnish plate: - a huge pile of mung bean sprouts - thai basil - jalapeños - lime   Pho (pronounced fuh) is a high maintenance dish, which when done well is so fun to eat and so satisfying. I don't know of anything that compares.  They passed the Pho test with flying colors. I will be back Pho Sho. (there is a huge menu full of tasty treats)  Oh and watch out for those MONSTER potholes in that shithole of a strip mall."}
{"text":"I think I was actually looking for the Bahn Mi place located in the shopping center next door, but got lost and awkwardly ended up eating at this place. They didn't have bahn mi's but they did have tofu and vegetables which made me a happy camper. Ordered the lemongrass tofu with veggies and was expecting something phenomenal. Unfortunately, they used a premed paste from a jar and not fresh lemongrass which ruined the taste for me. Additionally the vegetables were very heavy on onion which I understand as a cost saving mechanism, but as a customer I don't want to eat tofu and onions.   Not sure I would come back given all of the amazing Vietnamese places in Charlotte, especially off of Independence Blvd."}
{"text":"My nephews and niece are half Vietnamese and their grandma made the best PHO EVER... Finally a place in Charlotte that is close to it. I enjoy the flavors of their pho because it's not light in flavors but it's perfectly balanced. The portions are good too!  The lady is so nice to me and I can just come here and relax and enjoy my meal like I'm at home. Who doesn't like a nice steaming bowl of pho?  This place gets 5 plus two thumbs up. But y'all know I use a fork."}
{"text":"Pretty legit Vietnamese food in a hole in in the wall joint. I am spoiled by Eden Center in Northern Virginia, but this is somewhat similar to Hung Viet over in our neck of the woods. The liberal use of porky, savory goodness is obvious in #26, definitely not something sanitized for non-asian palettes. I especially enjoyed the greasy little spring roll I had with my platter and the meatloaf- very flavorful. My SO had the #21 which is quite legit as well, but he complained about the vermicelli being too soft. The price is also right- my massive platter set me back about 10.50$!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely a 1-dish woman, but at Truc, I am.  Tofu with Lemon Grass & Peppers baby!  I normally come here with my parents for dinner (may I say serious mooch-off); it's like a freaking deja-vu: Dad always orders Pho (rare beef & tendon), Mom orders Porkchop rice plate, and I order a summer roll starter & tofu.  And it's consistently yummy.  Pho soup base is good, some places I've been has some odd herbal taste to it but not here (and don't forget the fish sauce and what my friends and I refer to as the \"cock\" (hot) sauce haha).  The regular size isn't huge.  Rice plates serve with broken rice or regular white rice.  I like their grilled meat but more so the scallion on the rice. Now my tofu... which is a little spicy with tons of onions and peppers.  It goes very well with rice.  Tofu itself is crispy on the outside and soft inside.  My only complaint is not enough tofu.  Mind you this is in the Asian Corner strip mall, so the location may look \"questionable\" to some.  2 PSAs: avoid taking your low-riding sport car here... if you have never been to this parking lot, it closely resembles the moon's surface... in fact I think NASA should train here AND Truc is one of the Dividend Miles Dining program with US Airways, so use your registered credit card to pay and earn miles!"}
{"text":"A great find by Yelp! This place is certainly a hidden gem. Located in that seedy Asian strip mall we hate to love, this place continuously pushes out the finest Asian cuisine that Charlotte has to offer. Truc is no different. I think this place really does offer the best, most authentic Vietnamese food in Charlotte. The summer rolls were hefty- stuffed with lettuce, vermicelli, pork, and shrimp, it was a great appetizer to get our taste buds rolling. I got the pho dac biet, which cAme with slices of rare beef, beef balls, tripe. The broth tasted homemade and real- no packaged broth mix here. The atmosphere is clean, bright and comfortable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Truc might be as authentic as you can get...starting with it's prime location. It's located in Asian Corner N. Tryon and Sugar Creek. The location is authentic because the strip mall is just so reminiscent of the asian plazas and strip malls back home in Ca. Nice touch.  Truc is so authentic that some of the menu items really aren't for the faint at heart. None of it has really been toned down for the American palate. If you're a regular Andrew Zimmer though, have at it!   If you want to avoid the crowds, do not go during early morning, lunch hours. Most asians traditionally eat pho in the mornings, so weekends here are crowded. Dinner is completely empty. There was only one other customer here at dinner.   Normally I have pho here, but this time I opted for the combination chao ga - rice porridge. The one thing I could have done without was the diced raw ginger. Just way too strong for me and it ruined my meal. Other than that, it wasn't too bad. Since it was a combination, it came with everything. I mean everything. I don't want to get into detail for those landlubbers who get seasick; but if you're a novice, it might make your stomach drop like a roller coaster.   Overall usually very consistent and one of my regular pho restaurants."}
