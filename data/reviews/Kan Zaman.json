{"text":"The meal is ok but I am not happy about the staffs. When dj was playing,   we were dancing, I saw a guy who is recording the video while zooming on the legs and.... I called the waitress and asked her to tell him we are not comfortable that you record us. He doesn't stop and waitress told me that he is the manager and I can't do anything. I don't know where they will use those videos but be aware of it."}
{"text":"I checked out Kan Zaman for lunch during a week day.  I had read good reviews on here, and the price seemed very reasonable for an AYCE buffet.

Set alone in a strange little strip mall off W25th Street, KZ has an interesting atmosphere.  You enter through a take-away area to reach the restaurant section.  There was an older Middle Eastern looking man behind the counter of the take away area, who barely looked up when we entered.  Not even a \"welcome\" or smile was offered.

Inside the restaurant, a middle aged woman seemed to be the only staff.  She was rather friendly and attentive, but had her hands full attending to us and the handful of other occupied tables.

You can get a better feel for the atmosphere from other reviews.  The place is arranged to be open with a Middle Easter n \"bazaar\" atmosphere, with cushioned benches and booths.  Flags of the Middle East hang on the walls along with art and artifacts, and a big screen TV was playing a variety of Arab-language music videos. The center of the room is wide open, presumably to allow for the oft mentioned belly-dancers, who I presume appear for dinnertime entertainment.

The buffet was a good selection of typical Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fare: pita, hummus, falafel, long grain rice, baba and tabuleh, and a good number of other items.  They also offer a selection of savory pastries, which are essentially yeast breads filled with meat and/or vegetables.  My biggest complaint was that neither these pastries, nor the pita were heated.

Overall the service was good and the food was more than adequate, although there was nothing that made my jaw drop or that will make me rush back ... although I certainly will return.  Next time, I think we'll try dinner and see this belly-dancing for ourselves."}
{"text":"Shitty service, servers don't know what they're doing and the hookah didn't taste at all like what we had ordered.. overall disappointed..thus place used to be cool but they definitely need to step their game up cuz it didn't measure in any way, shape, or form... I came home on leave just to wish I had brought my hookah from home cuz i do a better job than they do.."}
{"text":"Just don't go here, I felt embarrassed bringing my Chinese friends here. The place is dirty, the food is bad, the hookah is bad and they place is very expensive on weekend and dirty!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the waiter was super nice and the entrainment area wasnt 5star but ok"}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet. The food was hot and fresh. The hummus had a bit too much tahinni  though. I think they over charged me $5. I should have said something."}
{"text":"This experience was our 2nd time at kan zaman. We were giving it another try, hoping the 1st bad experience was a fluke. Um...not so much. 

1. The hummus order comes with the pita in little sandwich baggies as if your mom packed it in your lunchbox. No plates, just baggies. 

My husband had to leave the table three times during our meal:

2. First, we had no silverware for 15 min after our food (or my food anyway, see #5) came. He found someone halfway into the kitchen who gave him a couple of plastic forks and send him back to the table with them. (No napkins, no apology.)

3. Next my husband had to get us napkins. With no waitstaff in sight and no napkins at the table, he had to get paper towels from the bathroom for us to wipe off our hands. 

4. The last time he had to leave the table was to find someone to adjust our bill (see #6) and take our money. We literally could have left without paying - we were deserted. I should mention that there was another table occupied, across the restaurant. Their waiter was attending to them while we were stranded, but we couldn't flag her down at all. 

5. My husband's sandwich never came. We were too aggravated to reorder it. One less entree for their profits. Whoops. 

6. They charged us for hookah even though WE NEVER ORDERED OR RECEIVED HOOKAH. This tripled our bill. Any server who looked over her bill would have caught this error. 

PS: There's really cheesy music videos playing in another language, and it is loud."}
{"text":"Dude this place is wacky.  I go in here for some quick spinach feta pie grab or what have you every now and again, and there is absolutely no consistency with the food at all!  The meat pies are made differently every week it seems, and sometimes the spinach-feta pies actually have feta, and other times they have whatever cheese they use for the pizza! 

But because everything is usually at least a couple notches above simply edible, it's like playing the lottery.  Kind of fun.  Sure, sometimes you get the rice pudding to find out it tastes like vinegar, and sometimes you win big and find out that this week they have these rad fried zucchini patties for a dollar each!  Or homemade donuts that kind of blow but are sprinkled with those little multicolored fennel candies in place of sprinkles!  It's totally unpredictable.

I kind of want to knock off a star for the old man that's sometimes at the counter who would be outrun by a snail to the microwave and back, and then takes 90 seconds to separate a stuck plastic bag from the stack for you...but he looks like the guy that's probably seen a lot of action and bombed out buildings back home his whole life so it's cool he can take his time.

EDIT: P.S.  on the side of the building it has three lit up signs: GYRO KING, SHAWARMA KING, FALAFEL KING.  I get high aspirations and everything, but come on!  You cannot be king of all three, kan zaman!"}
{"text":"My review is only for drinks and nightlife. The venue has a lot of sitting where you can relax and enjoy music and drinks. The problem is that there is not much to enjoy about the drinks and the pricing changes randomly. It was very overpriced. They serve you in a very low quality 6 oz plastic cup and charge you $10 for well vodka. They were serving in big crystal glasses and then switched and still charged the same for half the volume. Looking at other reviews, it looks like this is how this place treat there clients, with no interest on making sure you go back.

I am going to try to avoid going back and will not give the food a try."}
{"text":"It's my very first time to this place on a Friday night...No more than 3 tables were taken, it took more than a couple of minutes to talk to someone to get a table.

First the waitress comes to take the drink order, she did not know what drinks they had at the bar. We were told that they don't serve glass of water, we just have to buy bottled water.

Got my appetizer and waited for 5 minutes to get my silverware..my friend asked for vegetation options, the waitress responded by telling him to look at the menu and figure it out.

The waitress ( Lucy ) was mean and food was mediocre at best. I could go on about reasons why I am not going back here again...but enough said, 1 star is as high as I could rate my experience !"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant three times just to be fair and give them the benefit of the doubt. The first time I went there for lunch by myself. The service was okay, but the food wasn't that great. You can tell it was leftover from previous days.
I went back for lunch a week later but accompanied by a co-worker. Again, you can tell that the food wasn't fresh and they ran out of baked chicken. I asked the waitress and she said they are cooking some in the kitchen. We waited for about 10 minutes, and still no chicken. The waitress start complaining about the kitchen staff and how because of them she is not making any tips, even thought a gratuity is automatically added to the bill. So, we just got up and left.
Last night, I went back with friends and the food wasn't any better. No free refills !!!'
I will not go back to this place at all !!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion they have some of the best Hookah around, strong and flavorful. I have not tried the food yet but will update my review when I do."}
{"text":"The hookah is just excellent, good service with very lovely staff & friendly service . We ordered some salads & Arabic mezza dishes . Everything is just fine ."}
{"text":"I connected with manager Mohammed about a month ago about bringing a group of my college students interested in Middle Eastern dance and culture to Kan Zaman. He was very helpful through the process of organizing this. Last night I brought over 20 people with me to celebrate the end of our semester. We were treated to excellent service, and really fun entertainment. The community at Kan Zaman is really warm and welcoming. We did Lebanese/Palestinian and Iraqi line dances, and enjoyed the 2 shows by the very talented belly dancer. The food was tasty and very reasonably priced. The parking was easy (expanded to the lot next door).  This is a great place for group events. We are very grateful to the staff and artists there for the wonderful time we had!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with the Hookah. I had a blast here with some friends! We started with dinner and ended with some hookah! 

If you haven't been to Kan Zaman, I think you should go. It is an experience and fun. The food isn't to die for, but it isn't bad and there is a unique vibe.

They have belly dancers there a lot."}
{"text":"I was staying a night in Cleveland and was looking for some halal food and I found this place in town \"Middle Eastern style restaurant \". So when I left to check out the downtown... which was dark and dead after 7ish I believe! I started looking for this place and vola found it. 

My first impression was it was quite big as the area was big and they had parking. As I went in, there were 2 sections one for take-out and the other area was a shisha lounge.  We couldn't sit there as I had family & kids due to smoke from shisha inside the lounge area.  Then we did take out.

The service was fast and didn't take long for them to get the food ready and it was fresh and hot. We ordered a bunch shawarama wraps and plates with a zatar pizza which was huge and we were expecting bread with zatar spread but it was an actual pizza. You might ask what zatar is? Well it's a a blend of herbs, sesame and salt. The food was packed nicely and stayed warm till the hotel. The meat was cooked properly and tasted good as well zatar pizza. 

All in all the food was good and it wasn't heavy on the pocket either."}
{"text":"I called this store about a past due invoice for a client of mine. I was told to go F myself and hung up on. I finally talked to a waitress that was reasonable and gave me an email address to send the invoices. Since that time I have been lied to about when Waleed would be in to pay the bills. When I call they also put people on the phone that say unrepeatable things to me. 

If this is the way they treat their vendors it would explain why the prices flux like they do. I have not had one pleasant experience dealing with this business over the phone. they are rude and vulgar people."}
{"text":"I love this place.  When I went with some mutual friends for dinner and some hookah, I was suprised that the restaurant was not more crowed.  We were the only ones for a good hour or two.  The food is great and very reasonably priced.  
The hookah is good, as well.  I was a little nervous about the idea of smoking something strange in public, but it was definitely legit.  My friends attempts to \"put a little something extra\" in it failed, which made me feel better.
The only uncomfortable part of the night was when the lights turned down, the band came out, the belly dancers started moving and we were inundated with Turkish men who appearantly took a liking to me.  A little intimidating.  But is was a total blast.  You can eat, drink, smoke some hookah, watch a belly dancer, see a band and have a dance party all at one place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vegetarian Plate... It was very good. The couple who oversee the place were very nice. My food was prepared very quickly as I ordered and waited for my food. I was in and out in about 5 min. This is a must try for Ohio City natives in the mood for middle eastern food.. Open late."}
{"text":"This  place had a comfortable scene at 10:30p on a Tuesday night where a few folks lingered near the dessert case drinking coffee & eating a cake-like pistachio pastry  as talking heads flitted on the television.  Me?  I was hungry for falafel and if you are a Clevelander, you know there's a lot of good falafil to be had in the CLV.  Two of the best, IMO, are Nate's & Maha's, both just south of Kan Zaman.  
Of course neither are open @ 10:30 on a Tuesday night.
Onward to the eating - I can definitively tell you that Kan Zaman is not the best falafel in town, but it's far from the worst falafil either; which, by default, makes it better than 99% of the chain-food available at 10:30 on a Tues.  Further, the website lists Kan Zaman as being open till 2:30a M-Sa......and if you like honey/phyllo/nut pastries; you are in nirvana."}
{"text":"I will never do business with this place again.
I was there tonight with my tango class.  I ordered at the front counter with an older man.  As he took my order I noticed he put a higher price on one of my items.  I questioned him and let him know what the price stated on the menu.  He made up a story that that price was only if you buy 6 of them (it doesn't say that on the menu).  He said, \"I will give it to you for the price on the menu any ways\".  I ate and asked for my bill from my waitress.  She said, \"the total is such and such price\".  I questioned her because it seemed much higher than the calculations I did in my head.  I asked, \"how much was the soup\"?  She said, \"I don't know, I think 4.50\".  The menu says 2.50.  I gave her my money and she gave me change.  I requested the receipt that she threw away.  She over charged me for the same item as the man did up front but even more and she added gratuity.  She didn't want me to see my bill because she thought she'd get more gratuity.  (I worked in South Beach, I know this trick).
I confronted her about the price difference and she said, \"It's not that much of a difference and gave me the money that she owed me\". Lousy way of doing business.  I'll never be back to eat or drink and I definitely will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch on a weekend and was pleasantly surprised with the food and pricing.  Cheap and good, which means I will be back for more.  Even though they had the buffet for lunch, we wound up ordering off the menu, tried the labaneh, gyro and Shish Kafta and all were very tasty.  Not the best middle eastern food I've had, but excellent for the price, lunch was super cheap!  Will definitely be coming back at night for some Hookah and some Belly Dancing with a big group, from the website pictures it looks like a great time!!"}
{"text":"I came here just for the hookah and it tasted good but this place was dead on Friday night and I was suprised they let people smoke cigarettes in here. It takes away from the vibe and makes the whole experience less enjoyable. I won't come back simply because I don't want to be surrounded by people smoking cigs while I'm trying to enjoy hookah"}
{"text":"Are you really drunk and looking for food at the end of the night?  If yes, this is probably a great spot for you.  If not, I don't think I would bother.  In the past, this place took care of my drunk hunger at the end of the night.  It seemed so wonderful back then.  Now that I don't really drink to excess, I just can't dig it.  I will say that I'm impressed at how they manager to patiently deal with drunk folk ordering take-out food.  But this is one of those spots I can only find awesome after a night of really tearing up my liver functions."}
{"text":"Honestly let me throw it out there if you're white good luck getting in. This place is for brown people only so best of luck getting in if you are white. It is honestly disappointing that such a toxic and racist base/community exists in Cleveland. Thanks for tearing down such  an innovative and open minded community.."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to his place. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Whoever is running it now is rude and dismissive of customers. They don't acknowledge you when you go in. They act like it's beneath to help their staff. Four people will come over and talk to you and the only person that is polite is the server. Managament and new ownership is just awful and mean. They seem annoyed with customers and their presence. I went back three times and it was the same terrible experience. They messed my simple order up every single time. Apparently no knows cares anymore at this restaurant. It's such a shame because they used to be amazing."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have been to many places, mostly in chicago, and this place is sub par. I asked if they had al fakhir brand double apple, the waitress said yes after checking, but she was wrong. I knew it was nakhla brand right away.  Initially the hookah was setup wrong, not enough water, horrible cheap coal, which was barely lit.  And she mixed up the hookahs we had and didn't know which one was which. It wasnt a busy night, so really no excuse for the mix up.

I had the kinafah, (dessert). Horrible. Food was okay thought, but nothing wow. 

Ambience is nice, service poor, food okay, hookah poor...........but the place has potential

I wouldnt come back here, I do know that the city has way better options for food.....

For hookah naive, this place will do


i agree with other reviewers...who on earth does not have free house water, and adds 18%tip....there was three of us....not eight."}
{"text":"Oh god where to start this place is terrible we went in on Saturday night and the manager/owner had his kids there under the age 3 at 2am??? What was it family nigh food is terrible and there was people smoking cigarettes inside very dirty I can honestly say I'll never return again"}

{"text":"The waitress was very helpful. This being my first time at a place like this. The food was very good- I ordered a chicken special kan Zaman sandwhich (a gyro) and it was great AND ONLY $6!! Very nice atmosphere. A little exotic. And the hookah was tasty!! Got a little harsh but I let the waitress know and she fixed it right then and there!! It was quite empty in here though throughout my whole stay."}
{"text":"Actually about 5 stars for the hookah! 
2 for the customer service. I tip my waitress's well so I can invest in good hookah service in the future. Drinks are sooooooo limited. And soooooooo expensive. You could pay 6,7,8, or 9 bucks for the same shady shot of any given liquor in the same night! Prices are unpredictable! But I return for the hookah.... The owner is very nice and friendly to customers. The chubby boy that sometimes sits in the front for the cover charge is annoying. Just bc I come in as a couple doesn't mean I want a table.... Part of my enjoyment in smoking hookah is siting at a booth and chillin'! Her I don't even mind if you sit another couple by me! 
Food--- ummm no desire to try it..., just doesn't seem clean."}
{"text":"Poor quality food.  Definitely not fresh.  Some items super hard and dried out (READ: OLD).  I have heard about this place numerous times for the belly dancing and salsa, but never heard about the food...now I know why.  We went here during the week for dinner.  The rice was super greasy, dried out, and tasted like it was reheated in the microwave, just as another poster commented.  And to think that the waitress said, \"we have really good rice here!.\"  We got one kibbe with our meal-not even 2 to share, and so ordered a 2nd, and it lacked the yogurt that it is typically served with.  They didn't even have plain yogurt-how is that possible at a lebanese or arabic restaurant????   The kefta was disgusting and tasted like chopped liver.  We were really looking forward to a delicious piece of baklava for dessert- that just topped things off...The waitress said, \"it's cold and hard-do you want me to heat it up?\"  She did heat it, but it was so dried out and bland that it was just  a pile of dried broken nuts and pieces of phyllo dough when we tried to eat it.  I can't say whether there really was any honey or butter in it!  How old was it really?  Needless to say, it was terrible.  On top of it all, they added a gratuity for 2 people..not the standard \"group gratuity\" that some restaurants charge.  The waitress even gave us a pathetic story about working in \"another restaurant where her customer said that the tip was included and she said, c'mon please...it's not included...where's my tip?\"  Was this to trick us into leaving an additional tip as if we would not notice the included gratuity that was definitely on the receipt?  I would highly discourage anyone from dining at this restaurant."}
{"text":"What an interesting place. I just got back from lunch there. The dining room had only about 12 people in there. The price was reasonable. The server was personable and friendly. Everything I touched I loved. What an interesting buffet. I can easily say I have never had a better lentil soup. I also know I like Baba Ganouche. (sp?) now. Sat in one of those big old booths and had a perfect lunch. I was absolutely amazed that I sampled a little of everything and everything tasted fresh and good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Food is definitely old, stale. I have ordered different items to give this place a chance to redeem itself but still would not recommend. Food poisoning is definitely a concern to have when eating here."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time was for the lunch buffet, they have hummus, pitas, honey cake, salad,  rice pilaf with almond slivers and lamb, plus maybe a few more things. Was a good deal.

Second time was to try the hookah, the first time the hookah was ok, then something went wrong and couldn't smoke it, the pellet was not burning right.  They sent another hookah for us, but the pipe was not working, might have had a tear. We got good service then a full refund so it was worth a try, good service, so we had appetizers instead. 

Would like to come back for the lunch buffet again~ :)"}
{"text":"Uuuuuummm.... Food was good!! But I was not into everything else sadly. Let me list the issues:

1. Smell. The place reeked of tobacco, which at a hookah bar is fine and expected. But while eating, a bit unappetizing. There needs to be a solution for that, like not smoking where you dine patrons?
2. Service. The young girl helping out (high school age maybe) seem to really resent working there, and outwardly acted like it. But when the older lady/manager took over, she was pretty MIA and not very good at answering questions about if the meat was kafta or shawarma, which seems strange for a middle eastern restaurant to not know the difference. 
3. Automatic gratuity. For the one hour we were there for lunch, we were the ONLY patrons. 2 girls ordering a salad and two pies. 15% wtf?? Honestly if they hadn't done automatic, I always do 20%. So really there just hurting themselves while trying to not hurt themselves. 
4. Food was good don't get me wrong. But I've had better. 

I honestly don't mind that they had their kids there. It's a family owned place. And the location and layout and decor were actually very nice. Too bad all the other things overshadowed the couple good things."}
{"text":"Kan Zaman, according to the website, means \"Once upon a time\"

Kan zaman, there was a couple, starving and looking for good Middle Eastern food

They had heard from co-workers that this was a good place to go

So, they came here one chilly Saturday, looking for the lunch buffet advertised on their website

But, unfortunately, it seems like the buffet is only on weekdays.

The food regardless, was very good.  They did the next best thing, which was order the sampler platter, which was a combination of both their cold and hot foods.  It included baba ganoush, hummos, grape leaves, tabouli, falafel, kibbee, and several skewers of lamb and chicken.  The real standouts were the baba ganoush and the kibbee, some of the best to be had in Cleveland.

Also, the Turkish coffee was perfect, very smooth and not bitter at all.

So, after the end of their meal, they decided this was a good place to go, and some day they would like to try the lunch buffet to sample even more Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Yep. FIVE WHOLE STARS!!!  let me FIVE reasons why this establishment rates this high. 
1. belly dancers  were legit! 
2. DJ/ MC rapper was on point... Laced with infectious hip hop, reggae and pop feel. I don't speak Arabic but the music was live. 
3. Atmosphere was very chill and comfortable. People were polite and non bothersome. Love the fact that it appeared to me that every patron was in their own little bubble. 
4. They stay open until 3 am. Yah! 
5. Prices are reasonable 

I/ We shall be back. Thanks Kab Zaman!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go on a Friday night when I'm just looking to chill out with the guys or lady. The atmosphere on Friday nights is very mellow and calm which is exactly what I'm looking for. Not to mention, the service on Friday nights is very good."}
{"text":"The owners of this place are not friendly at all and they treat people very badly. They ask people to pay the cover charge of the show before the show starts instead of letting people sit comfortably in their seats. I had a very bad time there and I do not recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"What do I say about this place, they are our go to place for some nice Middle eastern food. I've been here countless times now. Their food is large in terms of portions and is still light on the wallet. Try their shish tawook with a side of salad and you'll fall in love with it. Their fries are my favorite fries in town. On Saturdays, they have live music and dance and an open dance floor too but they charge entry fee for watching them."}
{"text":"I have come here with friends and my experiences have varied in the past. Usually you can get some alright middle eastern food and smoke a hookah here (that was the draw as a kid). But I agree with the reviewer who said this place over charges, make sure you check your bill it will not match up with the menu price and I am not sure if it is the waitress doing this or the owner (the waitress would undercharge to get a better tip, only the owner would benefit of charging more). Seems like this place has gone downhill since my hookah smoking days there."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Not only are they trying to create a fake middle eastern ambience, they also provide bad service.  The waitress doesn't have any clue about anything on the menu.. and they charge for water.  

The level of cheapness can be also reflected from the fact that they automatically add \"tip\" (Gratuity) in the bill, after serving you with shitty cold food and dumb waitress. 

BEST TO STAY AWAY.."}
{"text":"You can still smoke hookah inside?  Hell Yes. 

This was fun.  I didn't eat, but joined a group later on for some cheap Lebanese beer, hookah, and watching some sexy tango.  Ooh la la!

Friendly service here, we were the last people in the place and didn't feel like we were being kicked out.  Or maybe we did, if turning the music off and putting Seinfeld on the TV's was their subtle hint.  Either way, we sat in some nice comfy booths and enjoyed everything about the place.  

I'd probably come back to these booths for some PDA."}
{"text":"Came in today for a quick sandwich to go and wanted kubbah. They didn't have any kubbah. So I ordered the tabouleh salad... Again they didn't have any. I've been here since 510pm. It took me 10 minutes to find someone to take my order. Finally I got it placed and paid for it by 525pm. IM STILL HERE WAITING FOR MY DAMN SANDWICH! There isn't anyone even in here for them to be out of anything or a lack of service. Unbelievable and I'll never come back again!"}
{"text":"Best hookah bar I ever been to. It's pretty big inside, and it's decorated pretty cool. There are big tables with lots of pillows to hangout in. The food is good too. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"THIS DUMP LACKS HONESTY AND MORALS!!!!!!

We're visiting from California and we came here last night to have dinner and hookah since it had one of the better reviews on yelp.   

1.  The rice was dry and it looked like it was microwaved leftovers from the night before  (NASTY!!!!)

2.  They filled the hookah bowl half way.  A lot of crooked hookah bars do this to cheat their customers because they know most customers don't know proper preparation

3.  The waitress failed to bring a copy of the transaction.  They didn't even put the original receipt in the check book with our change (see #4)  I had to ask her for my receipt.

4.  The bill came out to $55.43, we gave them $100 and our change came back as only $44.00    ....    I'm sure if we paid them $55 ONLY, they would have raised hell right??  (This is probably WHY they didn't give us our receipt with our change)

5.  ALWAYS LOOK AT THE RECEIPT BECAUSE THEY CHARGE AUTOMATIC GRATUITY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never again and I'd like the rest of my change back please. Bad service, bad food and so disgustingly dirty that they have to keep the place dim and terribly lit so you can't see the filth. Also, I realize this is a hookah bar but didn't realize that people could just smoke cigarettes anytime they wanted. We had to ask for the table to be wiped because leftover filth from previous patrons were crusted on. Also, the waitress was unattentive and included gratuity for 2 meals in our check. To top that off, she kept about .75 of the change due back to me. I would've stayed and asked but I desperately wanted to escape before the crusty cushions swallowed me up. Ugh. Don't understand how they pass health codes."}
{"text":"I'll admit, maybe I'm biased.  I had my birthday there so was in a good mood during my last visit.  Speaking of my birthday, they were exceptionally accommodating to our large group.  Separate checks?  No problem!  Everyone was very happy with their food which ranges from burgers and fries to schwarmas.  Looking at some of the kabobs, you'd think, gee, that's it?  Alas, the chicken was tender and well marinated, plus the tatziki sauce was nice and mild without being too cucumbery.  By the end of the meal everyone was stuffed for under $10!  I could barely eat my birthday baklava!  

Another added bonus is that on Monday's they offer tango lessons.  I didn't participate in it fully, the instructors were helpful and they accommodated the big crowd.  I'll be back soon!  

**disclaimer - I have no idea how to spell some of the food options."}
