{"text":"Went last night with the family...  Saw a beautiful mound of smoked meat through the window and knew this was our spot. Ordered the Smoked Meat and Dunn's Smoked Meat Poutine. Amazing. Our dinner was on our table within minutes of ordering. Can't beat that!  Our server was great too. Very friendly and she nailed her recommendations.   If you're looking for a great Smoked Meat Sandwich, quick and friendly service, than this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"This particular Dunn's location is open 24 hours, which is awesome, but it's tucked away at the intersection of Jean-Talon Ouest and Décarie, which is less awesome if you feel like having a smoked meat and some fries at 4 AM. Not on the same level as Schwartz's or even Rueben's and a bit expensive, but plenty good in its own right."}
{"text":"Went there after work on a Monday night after work with a fellow chef to get a quick bite. Worst mistake ever! My burger I ordered was beyond dry and the coleslaw looked like it was sitting out in the open for hours. My friends Mexican wrap that he order was missing cheese and the lettuce in the wrap was warmer than the meat. I have no idea what type of chef would let that type of food leave his kitchen, but I will definitely not ever go back. Stay far away from this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Chicken Salad and the poutine portions are amazing ! I'd also suggest the burgers and Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. Very affordable and great venue."}
{"text":"I like that it's open 24/7. Great food, excellent staff and always clean. I would recommend the smoked meat and matzo ball soup."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a while and as always was really looking forward to it.  It was after 1 PM and the restaurant was at least 75% full. I heard people at other tables telling their servers that they were in from Toronto and other places. No doubt that this is a must go to place for a lot of out of owners.  The restaurant was clean. The hostess and my server were very friendly. The desert case was full of phenomenal looking treats. For me it's nice to look at but I'm always stuffed by the time I finish my meal.  I ordered the Super Smoked Meat plate (medium fat) that comes with fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw and the fries are some of the best in town. The rye bread is awesome. Of course I was there for the smoked meat.  This time, I found the smoked meat to taste as awesome as it usually does. However, the meat wasn't as fall apart tender as I have known it to be in the past. It wasn't tough but the texture was different thanI remembered. This is still a four star review. Maybe it was me. Maybe someone pulled a brisket out of the steamer a little early. My past experiences have been so good here that I'm not going to think anything less of the restaurant until I give it another try soon."}
{"text":"You know for a chain, the quality of their smoked meat is really conspicuously good. Suspiciously good. I think an investigation ought to be launched into the source of Dunn's smoked meat and the hidden secrets behind its consistent deliciousness.  Pros: cozy seating and decor, open late, delivery after 5pm  Cons: the menu apart from smoked meat is as mediocre as you might expect from a deli chain.  To give you an idea, these guys beat Snowdon Deli's smoked meat, and Snowdon Deli has been around since the 40's! Dunn's is up there with the big dogs of the smoked meat game; Reubens, the Main and Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for their smoked meat sandwich and poutine.  Food was really good. Portions were huge so was happy they had half portions which was perfect for me. I was only in Montreal for a couple of days, so got my smoked meat sandwich fix here. :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by our visit here. I'm vegetarian and my husband loves smoked meat so there was something for both of us. Plus, convenient on the way to the airport.   No nonsense service in two languages, and full of older regulars."}
{"text":"Je suis allée chez Dunn's un après-midi pluvieux. Leur sandwich smoked meat est un des plus réconfortants! Je dirais même que leur smoked meat est meilleur que celui de Schwartz! Deux options à la commande: maigre ou médium. Optez pour médium, c'est vraiment la meilleure combinaison de viande avec un peu de gras - la viande est ainsi beaucoup plus juteuse!  Seul hic: cornichon ben trop salé!  Note. Ouvert 24h! :D"}
{"text":"Not the usual that would expect from Dunn's. Came in for breakfast with the family Sunday morning.  Eggs were cold, potatoes were cold. Service was polite but slow. As my wife put it \"The best part of the breakfast was the slice of orange on the plate\". I hope things improve for this \"famous\" place."}
{"text":"Went here New Years day. Happy it was open but very disapointed with my wrap. Ceasar chicken Wrap was too crispy no chicken and the taste was not there . just bad very bad. Service was ok did not ask me for a refill drink only asked my fiancee.Stick with Smoke Meat if you go might be disapointed exploring anything else. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Big fan of Dunn's due to a few reasons:  - Opens 24/7 - Smoked meat, smoked meat, and smoked meat! - Affordable price - Huge generous portions - Down to earth service, nothing fancy flashy, just people who do their job and do it correctly!  Here are the cons though:  - Sometimes limited choice if you go in the early AMs (1-6am) - Could taste better since Schwartz has better smoked meat than Dunns  But I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Matzo soup was luke warm. It wasn't busy and it took forever for smoked meat sandwich to come. Once again, luke warm. Then waited and waited for the bill. Try Snowdons down the road or Chenoy's. Way better Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I've only been to Schwartz's  so when I was proposed to go there for dinner, I was sure, why not?   I wanted to try and see how the other smoked meat places stacked up to the Famous Schwartz.  In the end, after looking over the menu, our group decided to go with just sandwiches and its meat was not salty...two big sandwiches that came with fries and split by three people was enough to fill us up  Service was pretty efficient . Place and decoration looked like a 50's restaurant which I quite like the look and feel.    Loved that it is open 24 hours and so close to where I am located so that I don't need to go to DOWNTOWN to get my fix of smoked meat when I am in town :)"}
{"text":"Dunn's decarie is the worst. The service is horrible especially at night! Food is average compared to the one in downtown!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place!! Been to other Dunns, this one is the best one so far  Good food! Very good and fast service, nice staff, pretty big portions. Not because I'm a girl, my husband too loves this place."}
{"text":"I am from Vancouver BC, never been to Dunn's before showing up here on a cold snowy night.  I was really impressed with the smoked meat. Now I need to go visit the one we have on Seymour St. I didn't know we had."}
{"text":"Working in Montreal and having a smoked meat craving a lot of the natives recommended this place. I got the smoked meat platter and it was exactly what I expected, a platter of assorted smoked meats that had a good taste. Not out of this world but for what it is you get the experience."}
{"text":"Great diner food. The smoked meat sandwich was amazing. I ordered my sandwich medium which refers to the level of fattiness. My meal was accompanied with russet potato fries and an amazing non-mayo coleslaw. All in all, great lunch spot, with great service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and take out place prices are very moderate and roast beef sandwiches are the best in town keep it up mr Myer Dunn is a true inspiration!!"}
{"text":"I like to come to Dunn's for their smoked meat poutine. It's a good amount of food- I don't usually finish it all in one sitting. I like that they chop up mostly lean meat because that works best with the poutine. The food has been consistently good and I like it because it's a good alternative to Schwartz's which is much further away from my home.   In all honesty I'm not sure their sandwiches are worth the price. The normal smoked meat sandwich (by itself) is pretty small for $8.50.   The other thing I'd like to mention is their smoked meat that comes frozen in a box (6 pack). It's really good and very convenient to keep in a freezer at home. I noticed in the past few years that the price has shot up quickly, we used to buy it for $18 per box at Costco. Last time I asked for a price check at this Dunn's restaurant the cashier said it was $18, but two weeks later I came back to purchase it and saw that the receipt stated $22.99 for one box. Either I was given an incorrect price the first time or they just had a very steep increase.  I would give 5 stars if the prices were more agreeable."}
{"text":"Overall very average. The smoked meat is okay, the mozzarella cheese sticks are clearly pre-packaged, cheese wasn't even melted. Service was okay nothing special. Wasn't very impressed."}
{"text":"I'll explain right away:  I'm pregnant- so when I had a super random craving for food at midnight, my SO jumped at the chance of bringing me to Dunn's since it is open 24 hours.  It was the first time I had been to Dunn's on Decarie and it was delicious.  There were at least 4 other tables full of people when we arrived close to 12AM.  The service was quick and very courteous.  My SO ordered the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and gravy.  He really enjoyed it, but he did say the potatoes were a bit lumpy.  Some people like lumpy mashed potatoes though, so to each their own!  I ordered the Spaghettini Bolognese (I know- who orders pasta at a diner that is famous for their smoked meat, right?) and it was delicious.  I almost wanted to tell the waitress that I am pregnant when she saw that I used up 3/4 of the parmesan cheese container but she didn't say a word- (very polite, thank you).  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant.  The walls are covered in beautiful artwork and they also have 3 televisions so we were able to watch the replay of the hockey game.  We didn't order any dessert this time, but on our way out, when I saw the beautiful cakes, I almost regretted it- they look amazing.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely go back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Chez Dunn's, il est possible de manger un sandwich smoke-meat correct. Non, ce n'est pas le meilleur de Montréal, mais la viande ici est quand-même bien apprêtée. En général, le service dans cette succursale est décent, courtois et poli. La carte des vins est très simple et se limite à quelques vins grand public et bon marché. Donc, évitez l'endroit si, tout comme moi, vous aimez votre smoke-meat avec un bon verre de rouge. Le menu est varié. Le resto est relativement propre et bien entretenu.   Dunn's n'est pas mon comptoir à smoke-meat préféré, mais lorsque j'ai envie d'un bon sandwich à la viande fumé et qu'il n'y a rien d'autre autour, donc oui, je m'arrête ici. Surtout lorsque le trafic sur le boulevard Décarie est exécrable, et dieu sait que ça arrive souvent...."}
{"text":"So the staff is really incompetent. We asked about allergies because my fiancé is celiac and they said that the food was gluten-free and fine. After we ordered we discovered that one of the dish had soy sauce which almost always have gluten in it. The answer of the staff was \"if you have allergies don't eat here\". They didn't care. The food wasn't even that good and one of the dish was cold."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: At first I thought that the restaurant was going to be a typical rundown chain restaurant but to my surprise, it was pretty nice inside! Plus, they're open very late everyday which is perfect for midnight snacks.  FOOD: The food was very good. Burgers are juicy and the meat is packed with flavor, even the buns were delicious! The fries are seasoned and fried perfectly (I prefer them on the softer side) and the coslaw was nice and light! Loved it.  PRICE: Prices aren't TOO expensive. You're getting a pretty big portion and the quality is very good.   SERVICE: The staff seemed very nice and efficient. If you order takeout, the server will make sure that you're not waiting for too long."}
{"text":"Definitely not for tourists. I'm sure it's fine for locals. They don't deliver, although the website claims they do. First time I called, guy says they don't deliver but have a company that does. Okay, may I have the company? It's on the card. What card? Guy repeats, it's on the card.   Seriously? Fine. Rude as the response is, it's late and we are hungry and tired. Figure my husband will pick up. Nope. We can't do that. They won't let us order ahead of time for some inane reason.   We'll go elsewhere. I would recommend visitors go elsewhere, too."}
{"text":"Terrible service courtesy of Ahmed. I've been coming here for years and the service has gone down the drain over time. Our whole experience was ruined by the worst possible (lack of) service. From the moment we walked in till the moment we left, it was just bad. But he was standing there, in my face, awkwardly waiting for his \"well deserved\" tip. Like I owed him a tip for doing such a terrible job. All four of us wanted desserts but no one ever asked us if we wanted anything else/how was everything. Nothing!! I'm sad to say it but I won't be back. Customers shouldn't be taken for granted."}
