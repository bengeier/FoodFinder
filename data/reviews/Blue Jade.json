{"text":"I love their food! Their food is always fresh, plentiful and delicious. I have yet to be disappointed after experiencing years of great service and food!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite local Chinese spot hands down! The servers are kind and attentive to patrons. They remember even the fine details of our regular order, and cater to my gluten free diet. The restaurant is clean and not too small, but quiet. I often see groups for lunch or regulars enjoying the food. The vegetable soup is the best offered by any around. My children eat all of their food, which is a miracle by virtue itself, and it is a laid back family-friendly atmosphere. They love the wonton soup and if it passes their picky test- I know it must be some of the best! One of our favorite local restaurants- I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's Blue Jade now as others said. Anyway I got a bento (combo) platter. The eggroll was decent, boiled pork with black pepper, which I had not had in a long time. Fried rice was boring and may as well have been brown rice. Bourbon chicken was tender and nicely grilled over wood, which surprised me. The sauce was fairly uninteresting, but at least there was broccoli and carrots. The platter also had sweet & sour shrimp. Its tempura batter was extra golden and fluffy, the shrimp themselves were jumbo and very tender, and the sauce had a bit more ginger than most s&s. I only wish it came with some veggies, at least the usual bell pepper and pineapple. Lastly was a crab rangoon, with its tasty mix of cream cheese and green onion in a golden shell. Those are always great dipped in sweet and sour sauce. The service was prompt and friendly. I'd go back, and maybe stick to white rice."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at. I eat out a lot around various restaurant around the Cleveland area. I ordered the house fried rice and the Schezwan fish. The fried rice was soggy and had pieces of egg shells in there. The Schwab fish was sweet and nasty. Schezwan  dishes are supposed to be spicy not sweet. I will never eat anything from here again."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 2 times a week because they have the BEST chicken hofun noodles I have ever had from anywhere.  Its like the ultimate comfort food to me.  The sauce they use perfectly coats the noodles and its not the gravy type of sauce some places use. I also really love the spring rolls even though they are pretty simple. They advertise them as shrimp spring rolls but each one has only one very small shrimp inside which I normally pick out because I don't care for shrimp in my spring rolls. The hot and sour soup is good and has a nice kick to it.  The miso soup was very salty tasting to me so I don't order that anymore even though the tofu chunks were nice and large. The prices here are fabulous and the owners are very nice.  They know me when I come in and always make my food consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here a few times and I'm personally not a huge fan.  The staff is very friendly and your food is ready insanely quickly sometimes.  Once I ordered and I literally think the guy said to just come now because it would be ready in 5 minutes!  I gave it 2 stars because on several occasions I was pretty dissatisfied with my meal.  I've hand very bland chicken from here twice, hard broccoli at least once, and the brown rice I ordered once I swear was just white rice but with soy sauce."}
{"text":"This is more a 2.5 star review for the service but the food is just awful. I stayed at the Hampton Inn next dooor and this place was a quick 1 minute walk for take away.  I ordered the hot and sour soup, Vietnamese soft rolls (summer rolls for those that don't know), and the pan fried noodles.  None of the food had any flavor.  The hot and sour had no hot nor sour and no meat.  The noodles were full of bean sprouts. I am talking a good 1 lbs of bean sprouts piled on the noodles with little meat and shrimp. The brown sauce again, had no flavor.    I guess this place caters to the western palate but unless you enjoy bland tasteless food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is typical Chinese fair. The menu was changed about a year ago, and portion size was cut down. The service is always good. The restaurant is clean as well."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. I went to this restaurant and they serve me with Pork. They served intentionally because I told me many time not to server with Pork.  I has no ethics to respect customers requests."}
{"text":"My family get take out at least once a month! Always the dinner for 3. It's located on Engle Rd. in Middleburg  Hts. Nice friendly owners they know us by name! Also if you spend I think it's 30$ you get a coupon for next time 5$. Can;t beat it. Food is very good!When we get home it's fresh and nice and hot! Thanks Blue Jade!!"}
{"text":"*** RENAMED - BLUE JADE ***  A personal fav for dine-in chinese.  Typical menu but, the place is very clean, staff is friendly, and the food is always unbelivablly fresh!  - Ask for the \"extra-hot\" General Tso's... they offer a secret habanero sauce!"}
{"text":"Friendly folks, very good and authentic food. Go there they are awesome."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family ever since I was younger. I absolutely LOVE this place and always compare other Chinese food I've had to this one.   The egg rolls are so yummy! We also love the fried rice, cashew chicken, and Szechwan beef.  The staff is so friendly and always remember us. It got to the point where they would recognize my dads voice when he called for take out.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was very happily surprised .. for a small little Chinese Restaurant it was quite good and a perfect size for lunch.  Due to dietary restrictions, I can't eat the rice or Lo-mein and they were very kind to exchange a few steamed green beans with no extra charge!  That's true customer service .. Thank You! I'll be coming again!!!"}
{"text":"The service is fast, and they have good lunch specials. They have the typical restaurant style seating, so you don't have to order takeout. Its the typical chinese food. I love their spring rolls, they are filled with meat I think, and taste delicious. I will usually get one of their lunch platters, which is your choice of meat (orange chicken, lemon chicken, General Tso's etc), with rice and a spring roll (I usually opt for a second spring roll cause I like them so much). They have two condiments at the table in bottles. One is like a spicy mustard, and I'm not sure what the other is, but its a reddish/pink and AMAZING. I would be content with just ordering 20 spring rolls and dipping them in that reddish sauce (plum sauce or a sweet pepper maybe?)."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. It was not busy but the food was good and the service was great. I ended up getting their hot and sour soup and a general taos combo with fried rice. I usually like to try this first at a place even though it's a slightly boring dish because I feel like it's good to compare to other places. I though the hot and sour soup tasted good. It could have used some more tofu and mushrooms in it though. The egg roll was pretty good. like someone else mentioned it was meaty which I liked. The general taos was okay. Like I said its a weird kinda boring dish at any place. Even though the chicken was more fried than I like I thought it still tasted good. I would definitely come back here. I think trying something like a szechaun chicken might be really good because the chicken wouldn't be fried. I was also intrigued by the jalapeno beef."}
{"text":"Wow. Much better than I expected. I got an egg roll and General Tso chicken with fried rice. Probably the best I've had. Especially liked the fried rice. it was different."}
{"text":"The owners & employees are always friendly. The food is really good & fresh. I recommend the pan fried noodles & veggie egg rolls."}
{"text":"This is the blandest, most unflavorful Chinese food I've had. I ordered the General Tso's lunch combo and its bland, the egg roll also has little flavor and I also got some pot stickers and nothing there either. I was really hungry and am very disappointed. Only in town one more day but won't go back next time I travel here."}
{"text":"The two-star rating is supposed to be for \"Meh. I've experienced better,\" and that's exactly my reaction to this place. If you're looking for generally buffet-quality Chinese food in a restaurant setting, this place seems to have the necessary staples in the way of General Tso's chicken or fried dumplings, but it's nothing to write home about, and there are better options elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and has awesome lunch special prices. You can get the Kung Pao Chicken with rice and an eggroll for $4.95 - Great deal! They recently changed the name though and it is now called BLUE JADE. My boss knows the owner and told me he asked them why they changed the name. He told him there was a lot of confusion because there were other places called Hong Kong Palace lol.  The General Tso chicken is also very good! They are very fast as well. I ordered take out and they told me 10-15 minutes. Very fast service! It's very clean and nice inside as well. The staff was also very nice and friendly. I can't wait to go back and order something else on their menu. Best Chinese restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"their summer rolls .. or what they call Vietnamese soft rolls on their menu .. are the best in town .. delicious peanut sauce accompanies an order of 2 .. I often get 4 for my entire lunch during the work week"}
{"text":"This place was clean and food was  decent. Service was fast and friendly. I'd def go back"}
{"text":"If you're going to list your hours and say you're open till 10 don't close at 9:30. I went to get gas at 9:25 and five minutes later when I return they were closed"}
