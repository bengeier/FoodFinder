{"text":"Lakeside Cafe is THE stop on our bicycle rides around the northern part of Lake Champlain. Service is excellent; food is outstanding, coffee awesome."}
{"text":"This was a great find in upstate NY.  Best coffee around hands down.  The coffee alone is worth the drive from Plattsburgh.  The great food, friendly service, atmosphere, and low prices sealed the deal.  They know what they are doing with freshly roasted coffee blends.  I sampled two varieties, and I was impressed by both, loved the Moka Java.  The breakfast burrito and homemade donuts were excellent.  If your out on the lake or hiking trails, this is a great place to start the day."}
{"text":"This the Third year in a row I've come up from Miami to stay in Rouses Point.  I always make it a point to stop in at Lakeside Coffee.  The coffee is tasty and the interior is inviting and comfortable.  It adds some class the the downtown area."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by for a short break or have a light lunch if you're just passing through Rouses Point or to just get out of the house and read. I love the decor. It's so roomy, fresh, modern, hip and so clean (except maybe the windows could be cleaned more often).

Their coffee and teas are great. They roast their own coffee on the premises and use loose leaf tea. I love their caprese panini and grilled cheese sandwich. Always ate up every last crumb. The pastries they serve are locally made by a local bakery and is very good to go with that fresh hot brewed coffee. 

The people that work there are nice and seem to enjoy being there. There is even free wi-fi. It's big enough to accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"My brother, wife and I stopped by here the other morning for breakfast. Had never set foot in the place and I have to say I was very impressed. They have a very cool, mildly hip, understated decor, although the couches were not nearly as comfortable as they looked. The service was very friendly, and the coffee was quite tasty. My brother and wife had a \"Pig\" panini, while I went for the roast beef one, all of which were very tasty. This place is definitely worth a stop if you're in the area or just driving through."}
{"text":"Passing through. Clean, pleasant, very friendly. Plenty of seating. WiFi only 0.4/mbps, but still could watch Netflix. The staff seemed to know everyone who came in. Music a bit loud so bring headphones. Nothing else in the area so glad it was nice."}
{"text":"Here by boat and went to this coffee shop on a referral from a fellow boater.  We had Cappuccino, and they were excellent; same goes for the coffee cake.  The business appears to be Coffee Roasters, so we were curious about the coffees they featured, but there was no way to sample them before purchase, and none was offered ... kinda atypical of a small business and no engagement with customers before, during or after the sale.  We would have loved to have known more about their roasted coffee blends and would have purchased a couple of specialty blends ... but a person who appeared to be the owner or manager spent time cleaning already clean tables and unnecessarily tending to stock displays.  The restaurant is very clean and prices are on-scale with a Starbucks.  I would highly recommend, albeit the only place in town for coffee."}
{"text":"I like this coffee place, the coffee is good and the price points are fair, though I wish my breakfast sandwich had a real egg instead of those scrambled egg patty things in it. Other than that, this place is good."}
{"text":"While I've never visited the cafe I recently tried the coffee at a friend's home - wow!  Rivals any coffee I've and I'm a true caffiend. The Italian Roast is outstanding!! 
I'll be ordering some for myself and as gifts for others."}
{"text":"Taking a ride north and came upon this gem.  I ordered the Reuben and the wife ordered the Tuna Melt. We both ordered ice tea but they ran out on mine so I got a dark roast coffee. Sure am glad of that because the coffee was excellent as was the food, the service, restrooms, etc., etc. They close by 3pm so don't be late. You just don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good coffee, and a nice place to hangout or take a break"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Great spot for coffee, since there really isn't anything on the VT side near here. Good cappuccino, a little thin on the pastry selection. I'd go back. Lots of space for bigger groups or a single person."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see Rouses Point offering such a quality establishment. The coffee was delicious! Looking forward to another visit when I return to the North Country next year."}
{"text":"Beautiful town, beautiful local coffee house and beautiful people. 

The coffee and desserts are cheap and fresh. They have fresh brew ; we tried the ethiopian blend and it was good. 

Recommended for coffeee and dessert fix"}
{"text":"You know what I like about Lakeside? Everything. 
I live somewhere between New York and civilization, and Lakeside is a good in between spot where I can start the caffeination portion of my weekend. They have beans from all over (if you're into knowing every little detail about your source), a good selection of food options, an awesome setup and some pretty sweet art hanging around on the walls.
In addition to this, they like to try new and different things and they might have even exceeded my level of excitement when I recently asked them to make a London Fog. A while ago, in Canada, I tried this drink of steamed milk, Earl Grey and sweetener, and I was hooked. I'd forgotten about it until I saw an article about the drink's origins, at which point I decided to pick up a new hot beverage habit. 
Not only were the people at LC willing to try out this little experiment, they took to researching the sitch so that they could perfect the tasty beverage without any poking or prodding from yours truly. 
Amongst other things, Lakeside Coffee is a chill little place to get your day started...and I kinda like hauling ass through dairy fields to get there...it brings a much needed spot of happiness to the dull weekends one would normally spend in the Green Mountain State."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Pleasant atmosphere. Free wifi. I ordered a large mocha and it was great. I wanted to give them 4 stars but after I paid for my drink I gave them the loyalty card to get a stamp and she said we only do that for regular coffee and tea. Maybe I'm being a bit persnickety but I guess I'm just confused why they penalize you for getting a more expensive drink?"}
