{"text":"Casa mariachi looks entirely like the perfect little hole in the wall where one would find authentic Mexican fare. From their Spanish only waitresses and homemade menus I was excited to get a little taste of Mexico. However if this is authentic fare, bring on the Taco Bell 7 Layer burrito. Chimichanga was the order along with 1/2 litre of house made sangria and quesadilla dinner for the table. While I am a vegetarian, I feel it unnecessary to be restricted to cabbage rice and bok choy. Remember I am talking about a mexican restaurant not Manchu Wok. The rice, while flavorful was the primary stuffing for the large chimi, sporadically infused with re-fried beans and while it said cheese on the menu it was so cleverly hidden I did not discover any. The quesadillas were much of the same packed with cabbage instead of rice. However the rice followed on a side platter along with a tablespoon of re-fried beans and an artful drizzle of sour cream. The sangria was strong and delicious, though after making sangria myself this is hardly an impossible feat. $25 later I'm not sure what exactly I paid for, wait, might it have been for the Spanish poetry/political diatribe reading that unfortunately prohibited any conversation. Bottom line...I'm not sure if Friday night is always open mike, but that is all this hole in the wall is suited for."}
