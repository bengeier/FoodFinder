{"text":"I am a sucker for good service, and this place has excellent service. Professional and friendly. Very conscientious about food allergies. I was most impressed when my fork dropped from the table, and the server came over with a new place setting because he heard the clatter from the other side of the restaurant. Wow!
The food was pretty good too. Dishes that I haven't seen around Toronto. A mix of Southern and classic American I guess. I highly recommend the seafood etouffee (like a mild seafood jumbalaya). Lots of taste packed into one bowl. 
The price is a little high, but it's a nice place and I'd definitely go back to try the spare ribs with root beer."}
{"text":"Three months ago I would have given a 5 - but with the change in chef I can only rate 3 stars. 

This used to be my hands down favourite brunch spot in the city. From the fact that they take reservations to their banana bread (any one else notice how the recipe was different every visit?) I was there at least twice a month and confidently (yet reluctantly) recommending it to friends. 

But since the spring the food has not been the same - to start, everything is just, well, a lot greasier. My healthy scramble leaves behind a puddle on the plate and even the salad isn't as good! We asked our server what was up and she told us the chef had just changed over. 

We gave it about 5 weeks and went back again - food hasn't improved to it's old level of awesomeness. So sad. 

That said the service is normally good and attentive, and I love their caesar with fresh horseradish!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with friends few times there. We all like the place. Food and sevrice was good as well. Over all, I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this Sunday brunch. Breakfast poutine was amazing, with a pitcher of momosa perfect Sunday afternoon.

Great atmosphere, nice staff."}
{"text":"Fire on the East side has great ambiance, excellent service (split up bills for a group of 8 people, AND didn't add the mandatory 15% on each bill that comes with dining with groups of 6+!). The mimosas were excellent, they had banana bread as a complimentary starter. This place has everything going for it, except for the brunch dish I ordered itself. 

I ordered the blackened chicken omelette, wanting something more flavourful and spicy, but there was nothing \"blackened\" about the chicken. It tasted like those pre-cut, precooked strips of chicken you get at the grocery store. If the chicken WAS blackened, the other ingredients would have complemented it quite nicely, but they only served to make my omelette more bland. The walnut side salad had no walnuts, and almost no dressing, but tasted fine after I asked for more dressing on the side. The fries were crisp golden perfection, my favourite part of this meal. 

Maybe this non-blackened blackened chicken mishap was a one off, I'll probably go back another time because I really want to like it."}
{"text":"VERY hit or miss.  Some dishes are really flavorful and original, while others are bland or oversalted.  I know what I'm talking about: I've been here just about 10 times (4 times for the dinner, dessert) and the rest for the brunch."}
{"text":"Went here recently for brunch. Got in nice and early and snagged a great table near the window. 

That complimentary warm banana bread people always mention? Served refrigerator cold. I scratched my head at it and ate it anyway.

Tried out the classic bennie (eggs topped on ham and cornbread + fries + salad) as well as their crab cake bennie (done with crab cakes instead of the aforementioned cornbread). 

A couple of bones to pick with the meal
- Crab cakes merely tasted okay to me, I've had tastier (and bigger) ones bought frozen from grocery store brands
- Fries were mushy and some were even slightly undercooked
- Why put a piece of fruit on my plate at the very beginning when you can just give it to me after I'm done? I am just not a fan of melon dipped in egg yolk and crab cake matter.

With all these flaws, somehow I didn't hate it? I get this gut feeling I'd be willing to give it another try sometime in the future. Let's just say I'm not rushing to it anytime soon for now."}
{"text":"Busy place for brunch but I can't really figure out why! I had the eggs benny on crab cakes which I liked, if only for their novelty. Eggs were poached perfectly, which is a beautiful thing.... But! 

Fire on the East side disappoints in the simple side dishes - fries and salad. My fries were a bit undercooked, cold and overall didn't seem fresh, and the salad was wilted. The flavours are nice, but I think its just badly executed. Perhaps they just make a huge batch of the sides at the beginning of the morning. 

Tis a shame! I would go to Hair of the Dog till they get their act together."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after seeing all the great reviews on yelp.  Definitely NOT let down, had a great meal and really like this place.

I had the southern fried chicken dish, and loved it.  Decent portion too.  Wife liked her dinner, and was happy to have to decide between a few good vegetarian options

Reserved a table for 12 mid week and it wasn't an issue with them at all.  The wait staff is more than friendly and were great about making sure you had another drink if you wanted one."}
{"text":"I would have liked to put 2.5 stars, because some times have been really good, but other times, have been just so disappointing.

I think you'll find the service is always solid. The people are always prompt and friendly.

I've been there for brunch, dinner and even ordered a dessert for takeout. So I think I've had enough experience to write an educated review.

On my first visit, I had the Jambalaya. Perfect. It was quite a large portion with a good mix of the meats and shrimp. Very flavourful throughout.

On my second visit I had the salmon with quinoa and vegetables. Amazing. Perfectly cooked and I had loved the sweet blend of the quinoa with the salmon.

On another visit however, I had the meatloaf and found it to be very dry and bland. There wasn't any distinct spice or flavour that made me say 'good'. It really just became a chore to eat.

And then on another visit, I had ordered the 'Fire' banquet burger and was so disappointed. This burger arrived totally charred on the outside.  I know it's important to cook our meats properly (although I am a medium/rare kind of meat-eater) but this was no longer an edible patty of meat. It would've been like biting into a thick patty of saw-dust.  After I cut out the outside layer, there was barely anything edible left.  To add to my disappointment the server didn't even ask if there was anything wrong with the burger. I work as a server and would never have presented food in that kind of condition.

Out of the brunch menu, I really enjoyed the crab cake bennies, mushroom omelette and breakfast poutine. I was disappointed when the salad was drenched in dressing and the crab cakes soggy on one visit. I would've liked to have known who was cooking so I could avoid the day(s) when this person is in the kitchen. On this same visit, my boyfriend had the shrimp and chorizo empanadas.  Uber disappointing. The empanadas were sparse of any stuffing and his plate was just really greasy, like they had taken the empanadas out of the deep fryer and laid it on the salad to soak up the extra grease. 

I found the salmon bennies on cornbread interesting to try, but would not repeat, as I found the cornbread too thick, dry and overpowering for the rest. Perhaps it was lacking hollandaise sauce, I don't know, but I just found my mouth getting really dry while eating that. But again, it was also just lacking that proper fusion of flavour with the smoked salmon.

The spicy tomato mussels are definitely worth trying and I would totally repeat this one. It was quite spicy when we had it, but we both really enjoy a good kick for our mussels. 

The desserts have always been quite good.  They come out with new desserts on a weekly basis I believe. I find them a little pricey, but if you want to splurge now and then, you'll, for the most part, think it's worth it, if it's a type of bread pudding especially."}
{"text":"Weird issues at brunch today.  The food was quite tasty, and the portions were huge, but each of us had something missing from our plates (my egg breakfast didn't come with the promised biscuit, so I had to chase the waitress down to get it, two of our salads weren't dressed, and my friend's granola was missing the honey and lime the menu claimed it came with).

Service was friendly, the food was served quickly, and they were playing 90s dance music when we walked in, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch. I am always seated quickly, the service is great and attentive, and the food is delicious. I can't get past the breakfast poutine; I always fall back on that. The fries are fresh and crispy, the hollandaise and the perfectly poached egg on top of cheese curds are a winning combination. Their specials are always innovative; S'more french toast to the more classic peameal on a bun. Everything I've had here is great."}
{"text":"I will write about two separate occasions..My friend suggested we come here for brunch a few months ago and I'm glad she did..
We came in around 11:30 am and it was really busy! We only waited for about 20 minutes (not too bad) and were sat upstairs..The service was good and the food was pretty good! I ordered the spicy turkey and sweet potato hash and my friend had the smoked salmon benny..both items came with a side of fries and we both had bellinis (who can resist that??)...food took a bit of time as it was pretty busy but they served us some home made banana bread which was nice..the food was good and although it wasn't the best brunch food I ever had, its definitely worth a try!

The second occasion which kind of made me more of a fan was I went here for my birthday dinner..I wanted somewhere that was more low-key, nice ambiance but also close to my friends place..
There were about 18 of us and there wasn't any issue with making a reservation for a saturday night..the manager was really nice in answering any questions I had and when we arrived (although a bit late) we were greeted and were seated promptly..the place was quite quiet for a saturday night but we then realized it turned into a club later on..so maybe it got much more busy afterwards?
We ordered starters to begin with including the flatbread and the grilled portobello mushroom, grilled calamari..the flatbread was not good i'll admit..the bread was hard and it just didn't taste nice..the best was the grilled portobello mushroom
then we all ordered different meals from sausage to gnocchi..
everyone seemed to have enjoyed their meals and drinks..the gnocchi for me was  quite tasty but it was really heavy and one of my friends came and I shared it with her and even then we couldn't finish it..I kind of wish I took some home as it was pretty good but we were already heading out for drinks..
Overall, service was good, food was good and I definitely would come back again for brunch or dinner..prices are pretty reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I had dinner for the first time at Fire on the East Side and overall I thought the food, service and ambiance were positive. I must admit I did not do any research on the restaurant before joining a few friends, so thought we might be in for pizza, burgers, wings - a regular cuisine available in the area. Upon glancing at the menu I quickly learned that it was much more reminiscent of a previous trip to New Orleans with a mix of Southern inspired favourites than the Toronto Yonge Street neighborhood offerings. 

Amongst a table of foodies, we did not hold back and ordered a variety of appetizers, mains and dessert. I tried the Catfish, which was a 5/5 dish along with the Brussel Sprouts and would definitely recommend both. As a main I order the mussels but did not find them that good compared to what my friends ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto and Ribs or the neighbouring table's Fried Chicken. For dessert I order the Fritters which were another 5/5 that tasted like mini donuts fresh out of the oven and were awesome for sharing. 

Beyond the food, we had a great server who was quite knowledgeable and friendly. All and all I would rate the restaurant as a 3.5 but the service and coziness of this restaurant ill give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"So Bunny and I decided to check this place out after walking by it one day. Overall it was pretty good. Easy to get a table, good menu and complimentary banana bread. 

Bunny had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and I had the blackened chicken omelet. We went for brunch, but would definitely consider dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Not that good.  My eggs were strange and watery.  Everything else was bland.  Also, food was a little overpriced (I guess par for the course for the neighborhood).  The positives were the service and atmosphere were nice."}
{"text":"Amazing comfort food.  Amazing service.  The menus change seasonally, and they also have great brunch."}
{"text":"It's like I was at a different restaurant than everyone else. We hit Fire on the East Side at lunchtime on a Monday. Crab cakes were not on the menu - it was Pickerel fish cakes, and they were okay but not amazing. Also had the Old Angus Meatballs, which were good but not great. The bottled beer arrived sticky on the outside with a small shard of glass on the side (something must have broken above or near the bottle). Replacing it was not a problem but getting it in the first place was disheartening because it's not like the waiter was so overworked he didn't notice. The service was incredibly slow. When we arrived, the only other customers were leaving, and they kept staring at us like we were crazy to be there. 10 minutes later they were still trying to pay their bill. Eventually, other people arrived but clearly experienced the same frustration with slow service as we did. We waited with dirty plates and empty glasses on our tables before giving up on the waiter and going to the bar to pay the bill. Disappointing, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there recently for Sunday Brunch. Very good with some interesting and different menu items. Can be a little noisy when it is busy, so not the best place if you are nursing a Saturday night hangover. Young & enthusiastic waitstaff. Reservations sugested if you want to make sure of a table."}
{"text":"The empanadas on the brunch menu are terrible. Don't order it. Comes as two small deep fried and super greasy empanadas on strange textured scramble eggs with a pile of hollandais sauce on top. The empanadas have barely any filling in it (supposedly chorizo and shrimp) and it oozes oil when you just poke at it with a fork. Not enjoyable. The best part of the meal was the mixed greens. I would not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place gives Edward Levesque's Kitchen and Bonjour Brioche a run for their money for best brunch in Toronto.  I've always had excellent food and excellent service here. The servers have always been very kind and seem genuinely in a good mood.

I highly recommend the turkey hash or any of the various eggs benedicts. Their hollandaise sauce is fantastic. Another plus is that they serve banana bread upon sitting down.

The only minus is that it can get really loud."}
{"text":"Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was a wonderful night.  The restaurant felt warm and cozy - perfect for the occasion.  The wait staff was prompt, polite, helpful and attentive.

We started with the baked brie.  We both agreed that the meal could have stopped right then and there and we would be fully content.  It came with a blueberry compote and bread crisps, and the brie was mixed with pistachio and baked in a phyllo pastry. - each bite was better than the last.

My boyfriend ordered the southern fried chicken and would not stop talking about it the whole evening.  Quote \"it's like instead of putting breadcrumbs on the mac and cheese, they put a deep fried piece of chicken and gravy!\".  He was so pleased with his mean, and I was quite impressed as well by the few bites I was able to wrestle away from him.  The chicken was juicy and flavourful and the crust was perfectly crisp and not oily.  It came with collard greens and cajun mac and cheese.  I'm not the biggest mac and cheese fan, but I do know now that whenever I have it, I will INSIST that it is cajun style!  SO GOOD!

I had the jambalaya.  It was very tasty and filled with delicious seafood - crab, mussels and jumbo shrimp!  It was very much a treat to eat.  I only wished that the rice was just a little more cooked, but that's just personal preference.

I would definitely come back again... based on the other yelp reviews of their brunch, it'll be sooner than later!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Hello, Fire on the East Side. You certainly look lovely tonight. With your eyes (candles) a-sparklin' and your pristine decolletage (boobs). 

[Before you interject, FOTES *does* have boobs. Chicken boobs, that is. Southern fried, good lawd.)

Anyway, where was I. Oh, yes. What a warm, welcoming embrace it is to glide through the entrance and see your companions smiling from an intimate corner. The light, dim. The decor, subtle but lovely. The drink specials, duly noted. The prix fixe, I will have it.

For an affordable prixe fixe-y price of $25, I went for the calamari, mushroom risotto and chocolate mousse. Let's break it down:

Calamari: so so. I would have preferred more spice; overall it was a wee bit bland.

Mushroom risotto: As Chef Ramsay says, risotto should be the consistency of lava when you pour it on a plate. This gets points for being lava-y. I thought the flavour was prett-y, preeett-y good - but not exceptional. There was, however, a metric f*ck-ton of risotto... so we have a two-or-three-meal winner in our hands.

Oreo Chocolate Mousse: Not a favourite. The whipped cream didn't taste like the real deal to me, and there was, for lack of better word, a \"musty\" aftertaste throughout. 

Mojito: Hit the mark on this one! In my experience, FOTES does drinks well,

I have a feeling that FOTES is the kinda spot - like most - that prepares some items super well, and the rest are filler. I have yet to discover what those highlight items are. (I would wager on the fried chicken to be a winner.) 

I really enjoyed my FOTES experience - like I said, the atmosphere is terrific and also, the service was top notch. I just don't think I made the right choices (WHAT ELSE IS NEW). Conclusion: 3.5."}
{"text":"I have to say that Fire on the East Side was one of the better brunch experiences I've had.  Their menu was diverse and had plenty of options, and the food was hot and fresh.  Service was also great, if a tad slow, which is probably my only criticism.  Great ambiance , friendly staff. killer mimosas!  Free banana bread doesn't hurt, either."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 with reservations for dinner. It wasn't a busy sunday night but still nice to have everything ready when we arrived. 

Asked the server his recommendations for appetizers and he suggested the crab cakes and fried green tomatoes. We shared amongst 7 and it was a good portion! The crab cakes were by far the best of the two and easily devoured between two people. Fried green tomatoes were okay, the topping of shrimp really made the dish. 

3 of us ordered the pitcher of white Sangria, which gave each of us at least a glass and a half.  Ice Tea and Diet Cokes were both charged at $3 each. 

Our remaining friend arrived and ordered the special for apps that day, mussels cooked in Guiness Stout. Nice large portion of mussels shared amongst 8, where all the shells we had were nicely opened. 

I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya. The chicken was alright, I think I was expecting more heavy battered fried chicken drumsticks than a piece of fried chicken cutlet (really more reminded me of schnitzel with gravy).  The cajun Mac n Cheese was quite tasty and good. Jambalaya was filled nicely with seafood and large pieces of shrimp. I feel like it may have missed the spice content of real Jambalaya. 

Other friends ordered the daily special entree of prime rib stew on rice, i tried a small bite, sauce was decent, but beef seemed a little bland.  

Another friend ordered the smoke duck breast, but the highlight of that dish was really the mash potatoes, nice and creamy. I'm personally not a big fan of smoked meat, so even tasting a piece was okay but I don't think I would have enjoyed a whole smoked duck's breast. 

All in all, it was a decent meal, but likely try the brunch that everyone raves about instead.  I left the establishment thoroughly enjoying the crabcakes more than the rest of the meal. 

Also 18% gratuity imposed on groups of 6 or more is severely hefty.  The service was decent but we did feel a bit rushed at the end of our meal.  We were offered dessert before one of our friends even had the chance to finish his meal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food I've had in Toronto. Only one complaint, and I'll get it out of the way now. The ran out of the mango glazed chicken on a slow Saturday night. 

I grew up on southern/soul food so I am critical of said establishments. Fire on the Eastside was superb in every aspect of my dining experience. The ambiance is dim candlelit but not so much so that the place was hard to navigate. There was an intimate feeling in the main dining room, but it still felt casual. Heated outdoor seating was a plus too for cold nights. Decor was awesome. 

The prices are high, but I had no problem paying them after I ate. Sangria was 26 bucks for a pitcher which I thought was steep. 

My server was incredibly nice and considerate. No complaints. 

The food. 

Mango habanero jerk chicken taquitos were heaven sent. Crispy, full of flavor, and presented well. Crab cakes were authentic and incredibly fresh. Étouffée was delicious and they were not stingy on the meat. It was filled with lobster, sausage, crab and smoked turkey and smothered some dirty rice. AMAZING! The biggest surprise for me was the cornbread. On the first taste I thought it was just ok. I usually like my cornbread sweet as opposed to skillet cornbread. This fell right in the middle. I noticed a small cup of butter on the side. After a healthy dip it all came together. Butter and honey for dipping. It was such a simple concept, but it came together perfectly. 

5 stars in my eyes. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Overall: food was mediocre, only 1 or 2 stars especially for the price. Service was great - so service was like 4-5 stars, but I consider the food to be the most important part . We had dinner on Sept. 10, 2011.

I had been to Fire on the East side before for brunch awhile ago, and it was great. So when I saw a groupon ($25 for $50 worth of food), I snapped it up. But, sadly I was disappointed and I won't be back.

Pros: 
- Our server was friendly and attentive - we always had drink top ups and he was friendly and joked around with us. 
- Got a seat on the patio on a Saturday night without too much trouble, good atmosphere
- Drinks - they have an extensive drink list that is reasonably priced

Cons:
The food!
- I ordered the fish special - it was halibut and probably one of the most bland meals I've ever eaten. I rarely add salt or pepper to food, but in this case it was necessary. The only good part of the food was the beets, but the fish and rice were meh. And at around $25 I expect to have something more edible than what I got

- My friend has health issues related to certain types of foods and has a pretty severe reaction to anything with cheese or butter. She ordered the pasta special which was in a white wine sauce with smoked salmon and capers. She asked about cheese and butter, the server said they could do it without cheese and he would check on the butter. Since he never came back we assumed it could be done with little to no butter. But there definitely was a lot of butter. She couldn't eat more than a few bites. I tasted it, and it was ridiculously salty, even for me and I like spice in my food. All you tasted was salt rather than any of the food. So it seems the food was way bland or way over-salted, neither is ideal. And I felt extra bad because this friend just moved to Toronto and this was her dinner out experience.

- My other friend had the jambalaya which he said was decent, but nothing special. 

The general consensus at the table was 'thank god we had a groupon' because the food was mediocre and (we felt) overpriced for what we got. So if we had paid full price we probably would have been quite annoyed. With so many great places in Toronto to get good cheap eats when you're spending around $20 a plate, you expect it to be decent. Don't get me wrong I will drop $40+ on dinner if the food is amazing, but this was not even close.

It's a shame because the patio is great and the service was stellar, but since food is the most important ingredient of eating out, I won't be back to Fire on the East Side."}
{"text":"At last, I've found dependable (and affordable) brunch EAST of Spadina!

If you plan on having brunch here on the weekend, reservations are definitely recommended. The lineups here are teensy-tiny compared to the brain-explosive queues to be found at Aunties & Uncles or Hoof Cafe, but hey, why wait if you don't have to? 

Our party of 6 swung by here for a birthday brunch (family friendly!) on a Saturday morning. The place was bustling with activity, and the added bulk of our winter parkas certainly didn't help! Tables were buzzing as girlfriends were catching up with girlfriends, and boyfriends were catching up with boyfriends - close to Church Street, baby! - and thankfully, while noisy, it was still at a perfect level for decent conversation at our table.

The brunch menu left all of us scramble-ing (har har). Everything on there looked delicious, and with every dish coming out of the kitchen we found ourselves changing our minds. Definitely noteworthy are their great selection of Eggs Bennys served up on cornbread, and upgraded to delicious sweet potato fries. 

I went with their stuffed french toast special of the day, which on this particular morning happened to be strawberry and fig stuffed french toast, with a side of sausage. This dish was pure heaven - super soft bread (egg bread maybe?) with a layer of that fruity filling in between, drizzled with maple syrup. Magnifique! The rest of our table had no complaints about their food - except for mixed reviews about the cornbread base on the benny - and all in all, a success!

Pros:
- Sweet potato fries
- Poached eggs
- Coffee was always refilled!
- Most mains come with salad and fries
- Complimentary banana bread as you mull over the menu

Cons:
- Service was a tad lacklustre. Perhaps because it was because they were so busy?
- Mandatory tip of 18% on parties of 6 or more. Hm... see above point.
- Atmosphere - the buzz of people around was great, but other than that, the decor is a little ho-hum
- Washrooms: suddenly you feel like you're at 751.

That being said, definitely a reliable brunch spot for we downtowners who can't always make out it to the far reaches of the east and west. And uh, did I mention that you don't have to feel like an idiot for waiting an hour for eggs?"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and have never been disappointed. From the excellent service to the tasty food, this quaint little place is great for date nights and celebrations. The tomato tart is my favourite. Their crab cakes and goat cheese flatbread are must haves as well!"}
{"text":"Fire on the East Side is the best place for brunch in the neighbourhood. Great service, and food are always consistent. Complimentary banana bread is also such a nice touch!

My favourite dish is toad in a hole. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Repeat business is always a good sign. Why I like it?
Seating is comfortable- their front windows open out on the street so you get fresh air. They have a patio with overhanging trees for shade. Bonus!
Service - friendly
Food - Above average. Shrimp and Chirizo with Empanadas, not a common brunch item,  but tasted really good. Second visit, had the 2 eggs any style with peameal bacon.  Not your average grease joint plate.  Brunch plate all come with a side salad and some fruit which I really like. Makes me \"feel\" healthy! :)
Added touch - banana bread to start is a great nibbler throughout the meal.

tip: make reservations or go early."}
{"text":"i've been frequented this place for brunch. and as a brunch place it is laughably bad.

1. so so loud
2. they don't have white sugar. i mean COME ON. how full of of yourself do you have to be not to offer white sugar. they also don't have bread. THEY DONT HAVE BREAD AT A BRUNCH PLACE. 
3. food is average. hits and misses.
4. i just don't like like the ambiance - it's too bar-ish for me

my suggestions - go to the newly opened smith... or even lola's is a better alternative..."}
{"text":"After having a perfect Thanksgiving dinner with the family last night, I was hoping for a delightful brunch on a balmy fall Sunday afternoon.

We were greeted warmly by one of the wait staff.  He gave us a quick rundown and mentioned several popular items on the menu.  We were sold on Spicy Rosemary Potato Turkey Hash, which sounded great.

While patiently waiting for our meal to arrive, we enjoyed sipping their fresh brewed coffee, which wasn't too bad.  The complimentary Banana Bread came minutes later.  But it was cold, refrigerator cold.  I read from previous reviews that they usually serve it warm.  That was the first disappointment.

Then two nicely presented Spicy Rosemary Potato Turkey Hashes arrived:
+ Two poached eggs were perfectly cooked.  I loved that the eggs weren't runny.
+ Salad with toasted walnuts was fresh and the vinaigrette was good.
- Orange-chipotle hollandaise sauce was okay.  I didn't taste the orange nor the smokey chipotle in the sauce at all however.
- Turkey Hash.  There wasn't a lot of potato in the hash.  The turkey looked and tasted like thin slices of smoked turkey cold cuts.
- French fries were cold and tasted like they were fried in stale oil.

In summary, friendly service and nice patio, food a little lackluster."}
{"text":"I went for brunch today with my SO and friend today based on my friend's recommendation.  I was impressed by the fact that this place takes reservations for brunch!

Service

When we arrived, we were promptly seated.  Despite the place was packed, our server was quick and attentive.  We ordered our drinks and food and they came out quickly.

Food

I loved the banana bread they brought out at a starter. It was a great start to brunch!

Crab Cake Bennie - this sounded intriguing on the menu but when it arrived, I was taken back by the size of the crab cakes.  The crab cakes were ok, a bit underseasoned.  The hollandaise sauce was mediocre.  The only thing I really liked on my plate were the sweet potato fries (you can upscale your brunch for $2 extra)

Mushroom & Feta Omelette - my SO order it and it was ok.  The omelette was kinda dry.  He got the regular fries and they were soggy.  My SO really enjoyed the salad.

Smoked Salmon Bennie - my friend enjoyed her meal but she left the fries untouched.

I really liked the refills on our coffee!

Overall, I liked FOTES, I would come back if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch menus in the hood.
Pulled pork sandwiches seem to be popular these days.
I had one here with sweet potato soup.
The food was excellent and the service was quick.

I noticed they had happy hour specials and the drink menu looked extensive and fantastic.

I returned another time for dinner. 
The serving sizes are average and the dinner menu didn't quite interest me as much as the lunch menu.
However, everything still tastes good and the server was very attentive.
We ended up having mojitos which were great.
I really like the drinks here and will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great  brunch menu, but when I went back for dinner I was left disappointed. Food wasn't very flavorful and kind of bland for a soul food joint.  Though the brunch really is awesome. The eggs benny on corn bread was delicious. Free homemade banana bread to start is always great too."}
{"text":"What restaurant in Toronto takes a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday night during prime dinner time (7:30 p.m.)?  Fire On the East Side was very willing and able to help us.  We even had a couple additions to our party, and that wasn't an issue either.  Considering we probably took up half the restaurant, it was very nice of them to accommodate us.

Our waiter was incredible for ensuring that we all had beverages as we arrived and for offering refills at the appropriate times.  The sangria was great!

I chose one of the specials of the evening - a lamb burger with feta served with a side of bean salad.  The meat of the burger was delicious, but I was not impressed with the bun they served with it.  I loved the bean salad, but couldn't help eying the fries and sweet potato fries on my friends' plates.  The jambalaya, from their regular menu, also looked incredible and a few friends who ordered it loved it.

I was very impressed with our waiter.  He didn't mix up any orders (even when some people made very specific changes) and all of the food was brought out at the same time.  None of our dishes were over- or under-cooked and we didn't even wait very long.  I don't have high expectations when dining in large groups, so I was highly impressed with Fire On the East Side.

Note:  Washrooms are a little tricky - you sort of have to leave the resto and take the stairs.  The washrooms were very clean when I was there."}
{"text":"Bad service and so-so food.  

We had a brunch scheduled for 10 but the doors didn't open until 10 minutes after 10.  That was only the beginning of a sub-par meal.  The next small annoyance is that they do not serve espresso, guess I am not having a cappuccino. 

When I asked about food allergies the waitress said \"I honestly don't know whats in the omelette\" I had to prod her to find out, which is always fun.  Next they proceeded to forget to bring out our food until it was cold.  All delivered with the same harsh attitude.

Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and ordered Chicken Pot Pie and Mac and Cheese. The mac and cheese was VERY disappointing. The chicken pie was okay..."}
{"text":"I had brunch here on a Sunday. The place opens around brunch and I am glad I made reservations as it was packed by the time I got there. The service was attentive and friendly. If only they had offered me a dessert menu at the end :( 

I ordered the poached egg on turkey hash. It was good. I can't believe I didn't try their famous eggs benny on turkey hash...well next time. Their coffee is really good too. 

I enjoyed the experience and would definately recommend it."}
{"text":"Just call before you go...

Went for breakfast. Atmosphere is trendy, food is freakin delicious, and I would definitely recommend the Spicy Turkey Hash.

 Breakfast will cost around $15 per person (with tax and tip)... which i thought is very fair because you'll probably pay $10 bucks for any dive diner.

Recommendation;
You can reserve a table before you go... do this and you wont have to wait 20 minutes for a seat.  We walked right past the huge line and sat right down.

This place is just delicious in every sense of the word.

...Just call before you go"}
{"text":"WARNING: delicious sugary cocktails will induce a zombie-like state of general braindeadness the morning after consumption.

So many great reviews of Fire on the East Side, yet none really pay homage to the glorious and extensive cocktail menu!  I met up with a girlfriend here last night, and we did our best to sample as much as possible.

Not only does FOTES have a great selection of cocktails, but they offer them in a wide array of variations.  Yes, you could have a glass of their house sangria (red or white), but you could also have their peach, mango, or raspberry sangria (the mango is great, and the peach is phenomenal).  A good mojito is tough to find in Toronto, but at FOTES you can get an awesome coconut, raspberry, and I don't-even-remember-what-else mojito!  A lot of their drinks include tasty fruit puree, like the \"Blueberry Pie\" -- very fresh, and way too easy to drink down.  If you prefer martinis, they of course have a big list to choose from, along with standard mixed drinks and wines galore.

The patio is small, but very nice.  Service was great -- not too intrusive, and the waitress always seemed to come by just as we were ready to order round 2 (and 3 and 4...).

The only thing stopping this from being a 5-star review, was the very gross bathrooms that the venue shares with Fly (the club next door).  Please fix the toilets.  Ick."}
{"text":"We went on Sangria Sunday where a pitcher was $20. A pretty good deal, although the sangria didn't blow me away. It reminded me of the stuff at Nirvana, which really isn't the height of sangria.

I ordered the mussels with a side of fries. They were tasty, and most of them were open, a good sign.

The tilapia 'Po Boy was too much. With a thick layer of deep friend on a crumbly biscuit. It was served with cole slaw on top, but it was mayo based, and there wasn't enough of it to cut the heaviness of the sandwich. It was also served with sweet potato fries, delicious, but only adding to the overall weight of the dish. The order-ee felt sick after, which isn't a good sign.

Overall Dinner was alright, but it didn't stand a candle to brunch, which FOTES does quite well. Dinner, you get three starts. I'll have to write another review next time I'm there for brunch."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here. I sat at the bar and the bartender was wonderful. IT was my first time in Toronto and he went out of his way to make me feel welcome. The catfish was delicious and the drinks strong yet flavorful. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went in and had the smoked salmon Benedict. Nice combo with cornbread as the base instead of the usual English muffin... Great flavour, great value, and great service. My one complaint was that the quality of the coffee was a bit meh... Still, well recommended!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this restaurant. It's fantastic for brunch but dinner never works out. I was there last night and was served by a very pretentious waitress. The plates and glasses weren't super clean and I saw others sending back their glasses as well. I ordered the fish special. Watery rissotto and unseasoned, gritty fish - need I say more. Will I give it another shot? We'll see."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighbourhood spot just off of Yonge. There's a nice little patio out front and it's fairly spacious inside.

I had the grilled cheese pulled pork, and it was as good as it sounds! Just the right amount of cheese and the sauce used for the pork was great.

The beer selection isn't amazing, but what's on the list is decent.

The service was excellent."}
{"text":"This my favorite restaurant in the village.always friendly servers.great food."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood,yes. Nice neighbourhood. All dishes were yummy and the menu may seem limited, but maybe it's just focused. I shared a calamari appetizer and followed with an unexpectedly generous sumptuous fried chicken. Too much fried food but that's on me; they serve huge, very fresh looking salads.

I think I would like the brunch even more and will come back to check it out.

I recommend the berry mojito - the raspberry rum and blueberry purée put it far above any other I've tried."}
{"text":"Coffee still just as undrinkable and awful.  They gave us a great seat, a four top booth in the back even though there was just two of us, which I liked (lots of brunch places would make us wait for a 2 top).  At first, service was efficient and then....it just stopped.  We didn't get our food for over 40 minutes, but it wasn't busy and she kept walking by us without saying, \"Your food will be just x minutes\" --- we were just utterly ignored.  When the food came, the fries were cold, she gave us a ketchup bottle that had nothing left in it, and it was very overpriced for what you get.  I do appreciate a brunch spot where there's no line up but there's just isn't enough redeeming qualities to keep going back."}
{"text":"I just want to give a quick update.  My girlfriends and I found ourselves back at Fire on the East last Sunday for brunch.  I was hesitant, but there was a table, so I couldn't argue with that. 

I must say the brunch was good!  Our server was polite and friendly.  She brought us complimentary banana bread which was creamy and smooth and delicious. 

The Caesar I had was decent. 

I ordered the healthy scramble, which for some reason came with french fries.  It was a good portion of tasty, well seasoned eggs, salad, 9 grain toast (and fries.)  I'd have it again, sans fries. 

All in all this was a good experience and I think I'll return to Fire on the East Side for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is below average. We got the recommended ribs but it was tasteless with no sauce. And had quesadilla which I thought was pretty good but my friend said it wasn't worth full price."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on the patio in the early afternoon. The good: had a very good server who brought me one of the best Cesar's are - coming from a server myself, his service was impeccable. 

The not so good: my eggs Benedict was rather disappointing. The biscuit it comes on instead of an English muffin while creative just didn't work. The sauce was thin and bland like it was thinned out with water. It was edible but nothing that really made me say yum. Perhaps I'll return for a Cesar and something other than eggs benne!"}
{"text":"If i didn't have the cheesecake stuffed french toast at Lola's yesterday, i'm pretty sure i'd be absolutely enamored with the Chocolate Butterscotch Tart stuffed French Toast here at Fire on the East side. 

This was a 3.5* but service was good, so i bumped it up to 4 instead of 3. 

The french toast was good, but it was a little on the dry side and i needed to drench it with maple syrup even though it was already sweet, thus making it extra sweeter. Overall, it was a good meal, but i don't crave it the way i did (and still do) the one @ Lola's. 

Very good service (the host was uber sweet and polite, unlike some hosts i've run into lately (ahem, Splendido). 
Also very reasonable prices for the meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to brunch place, when I'm craving eggs benedict or brunch. I love the banana bread here as well. 

Everything thing that I've tried here is good. Their smoked salmon bennie is delicious. The hollandaise sauce is amazing and the eggs are cooked perfectly. This is paired with french fries and salad. The portions are a good size and filling. You can substitute regular fries for sweet potato fries. Or if you are in the mood for poutine, their breakfast poutine is great. 

I like the atmosphere of the place and the decor is welcoming. While it can get busy, I've never had to wait too long. In the summer you can eat outside in their patio area. I like this place so much, I've taken most of my friends here. I'd definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had.  I want to try every item on the menu.  Also, the servers have the best timing and know exactly when to come to ask if you want something or refill your water.  You will not be disappointed, this place could be the best brunch in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm so confused why this place gets bad reviews.
This place is connected to the trendy gay club fly. and you can tell that the men that were partying at fly last night just roll over next door to enjoy brunch in the morning.

This is sort of not your typical morning brunch.  It has a very clubby feel with music that is MUCH too loud.  It's like Fly didn't get rid of their DJ even after the bar closed.
So if you have trouble hearing, or would like a good audible conversation over brunch, this is NOT the place for you.

But the dining experience was excellent with excellent service.
The waiter was charming and sassy.
There was free chocolate bananna break to start (sooo yummy)
and the food was good and LARGE portions (which I totally did NOT expect).  I almost thought it would come with small pretty prissy portions.  But no, this is defintely a place where you can even share a plate.

Overall, the place IS a bit pricier- you are definitely paying a few bucks more for the ambience (which is like Fly but in the morning), the awesome bananna bread, and the general goodness of the food.  but it is worth it.

But because of the slightly higher price point, I wouldnt' make this a regular for myself.
And oh, I generally like a quiet brunch with occasional engaging conversation.  Music MUCH too loud for that.

But I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"Wether going for dinner or brunch, never a disappointment at fire. Excellent food, excellent service. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the service is great and the people everyone in the restaurant itself are really nice. I like how the complementary dips always change. Just don't try the spinach salad with apples and goats cheese. The dressing is very acidic, and does not complement the spinach and cheese."}
{"text":"A huge THANK YOU goes out to Yelp for introducing me to this brunch spot.  My quest for the best might just have finished right here (not that I'll really stop looking).  

A brunch double date was suggested, and I was put in charge of choosing the restaurant.  By \"put in charge\" I obviously mean that I begged to choose - I need to get cracking on my insanely long list of Yelp bookmarks!!  So after scouring my list of brunch places to try, I settled on this one.  So glad I did!

It was a beautiful day so we sat on the patio.  There was lots of room since we arrived right at opening.  Our server was very friendly, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking of Zach from Saved by the Bell every time I looked at him.  

Of course, I'd read about the banana bread already, but it was still a lovely way to begin a brunch.  And it was really good too!  I love that a restaurant would think to serve something like that, and when you think about it, it makes sense.  Dinner restaurants serve bread with oil and vinegar, brunch restaurants can serve a breakfast-version!  

The orders were the healthy scramble, crab cake bennie, smoked salmon and arugula bennie, and I had one of the dishes du jour - bananas foster stuffed French toast.  I've never had bananas foster, but it's always sounded delicious in my mind, so I figured I'd try it out in French toast form!  But I had dish envy when they came out.  Don't get me wrong, the French toast was delicious, it's just that the others seemed to get so much more.  I always find that I'm a little disappointed when I go for sweet over savoury at brunch.  

All in all, each and every meal was delicious, everyone else was completely happy with their selections and praised the choice of restaurant (yay!).  I will definitely be back, and will order a savoury option."}
{"text":"What a yummy find, ideal for a perfect date in town. Great service and the nice decor leading into excellent Southern food...start off with classic fried green tomatoes. If that has not captured your lady's attention yet, the savory crab cakes will definitely make her smile. Top it off with ribs or with the popular fried chicken, pure goodness, will make her smile even more, and then cry because she is so full but has to keep on eatin'!

The prices are truly outrageous for what it is, po' man southern food, but that's typical Canadia, eh? what's not too typical are the portions, very south of the border, which is a good thing, y'all."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this restaurant last night -- made reservations across the street at Bumpkin's specifically for a patio table only to learn upon coming over that they decided to close the patio.  I was quite ticked off -- the night was too perfect to spend indoors, and we set off searching for a more outdoors-friendly spot.  Fire on the East Side looked very welcoming -- but quite full.  After we inquired about a table, we were seated outside in less then 10 minutes.  Our server was very attentive, quick and friendly.  Food was delicious -- my friends had short ribs and buf bourguignon, and I opted for a burger with mango bbq sauce and chili fries.  Major yummy!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the ambiance and the service, 3 stars for the food.

I been wanting to hit this place up because of Yelper reviews and because I'm a brunch fanatic.  Despite it's reviews, the food was mediocre at best.  Maybe it's because I haven't tried everything on the menu...

First off, the ambiance was modern yet chill, very relaxing for a Saturday morning.  The service was attentive and great, so I agree with other Yelpers that this was top-notch!  Our poor fella had a dislocated arm and was still serving up a storm!  They started out with the COMPLIMENTARY BANANA BREAD, which was cold but quite delicious.

I ordered the traditional BENNIE, which was different because it was layered with cornbread, rather than your boring english muffin.  The cornbread was hard and flaky, so it was an interesting concept, but needed to refine it's cornbread recipe.  The whole dish had wayyy too much hollandaise sauce on it, made everything soggy.  The fries were cold and salty.

The other dish we ordered as per the waiter was the CRAB CAKES BENNIE, it came highly recommended so we had to jump on it.  It was your traditional egg on a crab cake.  The crab cake tasted fishy (which is weird because it was crab cake, not fish cake) and it was also very saucy and soggy.  The fries, came from the same batch, was cold.

Overall, we would dine there again.  Maybe it was really busy, maybe we didn't try to right things.  I have total faith in my fellow foodies and I don't doubt that this place is good.  It is right in my neighborhood so it gets bonus points for proximity.  The waiter gave us 15% off dinner coupons because it was our first visit there so that was an extremely nice gesture.

Good good, but not great."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to check out Fire on the East Side a few nights ago for dinner. I had been there about a year prior, but only for a side of fries or something else of the sort, so a full on meal there was welcome.

First off, stylistically, I really like the restaurant. Their southern dishes are complimented by subtle red brick walls, which definitely had us feeling at home. Me being a huge design nerd, aesthetics are important to me -- I felt very comfortable here.

I started with a glass of red wine sangria. Well, it was called a \"glass\" on the menu. Better described as a goblet. No complaints on my end though! I imagine that there were at least 5 ounces of delicious wine in it, and since it was \"Sangria Sunday,\" it was pretty darn cheap. Somewhere between $5-$8 I believe. The juice it was mixed with tasted fresh and was especially good because it didn't make the drink too tart tasting. Sometimes certain combinations of wine and fruit juice create flavours that are tart beyond belief, but this really hit the spot... plus it was so big it practically lasted me through the meal!

After hesitating with the menu (everything sounded really delicious, namely the fried chicken and ribs), I decided to go with the Prix Fixe menu. For $25 ($20 without dessert) I ended up ordering the Mixed Organic Greens, Wild Mushroom Risotto, and to end, the Chocolate Mousse. The Organic Salad was massive for a starter... when in Rome, I guess! It was easily enough food for me even after spreading the love around the table. We all really enjoyed how fresh and light is was, particularly on account of the bits of green apple placed throughout. On came the mains. Before I begin to describe the mushroom-y goodness that the dish offered, let me admit that I am in fact a major sucker for some good ol' starch. From quinoa to brown rice to fancy noodles, I'm THERE. So when a heaping plate of delicious, creamy (but not watery!) mushroom risotto was placed in front of me, I knew that I had hit the jackpot. Cue the drool. The portobello mushrooms took to the grain really well and the truffle oil really came through. So, there I sat with a massive portion of really delicious risotto in front of me. I ate half of it or so and our server (who was really awesome, by the way... more to come on the service) packed the rest of it away for me. I knew that I wanted to make as many meals of it as possible. Too good. Lastly came the chocolate mousse dessert. Again, a huge sucker for chocolate treats, but both my friend and I agreed that it missed the mark. The mousse itself was average and the foamy cream on top didn't do much for the dessert. Maybe I don't know what real-deal mousse should taste like... or maybe it was simply off that night, but I imagine they have better options (such as the apple fritters that my friend ordered... they looked amazing).

The service? Really good. The restaurant was pretty dead as it was a Sunday night, but our server was always around, continuously pouring us water and asking if we needed anything. He was super friendly, casual, and knowledgeable. He also seemed genuinely passionate about the type of cooking that Fire on the East Side offers, which is important to me.

So. Overall, I'd give the experience a solid 8.5/10. 8 for aesthetics/atmosphere, 8.5 for service, 9 for food. Yeah, the risotto was so good that it totally outweighed the mousse's faults. I'll definitely be going back for some more of that creamy goodness."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of this establishment. The other day, I came here for dinner instead of my usual brunch. The food was good, and more unique than your typical Canadian fare. It was a great place to catch up with an old friend. I have to say, the meal itself is not even memorable enough for me to remember what I ordered to describe to you and it was only a few weeks ago. But I would like to go again, let's put it that way. It's one of the few choices in this area that is suitable for a good casual sit down dinner. 

Last weekend, I came for Brunch. People! Instead of waiting in line for an hour, call and make a reservation! They take them!
Came here on a busy post Halloween Sunday morning, and got a table for 3. Food was excellent as always. The Smoked Turkey Rosemary hash has evolved into a Smoked Turkey and Sweet Potato Hash. Still good, with perfectly cooked poached eggs on top. 

Service was frustrating. Trying to get their attention to get the bill was a nightmare and me waving my arms around wasn't doing it. 

Also, they share the bathroom with a nightclub (Fly) that's around the back. It was god awful to see the club in daylight, let alone the bathroom. And I think it was unacceptable that remnants of the night before remained in one of the stalls and it was a absolute mess. 

I really don't like walking back there anyday, and I understand the shared facilities, but something needs to be done in the way of a curtain or a corridor to separate this so I, as a patron, do not need to see the club. 

Anyhow, wil be back, but trying to shut my eyes as I walk to the toilets."}
{"text":"It was a frigid Friday night - one of those nights where any restaurant with the name \"fire\" in it would beckon you closer. 

Fire on the East Side does NOT disappoint. Where do all the plus points come from? Here is my list:
1. It was warm and we cozied into a booth
2. The service was AH-MAZING. Our server was so attentive, made fabulous wine suggestions and was always there when we had a question or needed something (like hot sauce!) - and we were able to customize a few dishes to make them veggie friendly to work for us!
3. The food was finger licking great! (Not that I ate with my hands or anything)
4. When we didn't see anything on the dessert menu that tickled our fancy, our server made a suggestion for a place nearby that we would probably like (And we tried it out and it was fab - review up next!) ;)

If you haven't already, call them up and makes reservations!! Go!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Almost every dish I've tried is delicious. For dessert grab the banana cream pie. Unreal."}
{"text":"Tucked away just inside Gloucester Street, it's a bit far from the Dundas and stop the other one just off Bloor (right inside the Royal Bank). Despite that, it's worth the walk. 

The specialty is Southern cuisine, but to be honest, had it not been for the fact that one dish was called Southern fried  1/2 chicken and another was described as being creole, I don't know if the southern influence would have been that obvious. The dishes served here served unremarkable similarity to others that can be found elsewhere. Well, other than the jambalaya. 

Everything was tasty but if you're in search for an authentic experience, or even an experience that is just slightly different from the fare offered elsewhere, than this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Love coming here on weekends when the place is jumping with residents and tourists having brunch.  It can be a wait for a table, but the place feels like a traditional eatery in New York's Greenwich Village. Omelets, salads, and coffee are superb. Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary brunch among friends and family. Make sure to check out the special offers if you have the Yelp! app on your smartphones as it can save you $ on your dine."}
{"text":"I've had drinks on the patio here, but had never eaten a meal here. 

Had a reservation for 8 people at 11 am for Sunday brunch today and I was the first to arrive. We  were seated upstairs (kind of a disappointment).  Coffee and my Mimosa arrived and was very nice. We all arrived and had ordered. Our server was very nice and accommodating throughout the brunch.

Joe and Gino ordered stuffed french toast that was really not \"stuffed\" but rather two pieces of bread stuck together with filling, they both seamed to liked it though. Tony ordered  steak and eggs (eggs to be hard), they arrived running and the steak was not really hot as it seemed almost just warmed up, yet though it was tender and had flavour.  Andre has the pulled pork poutine, and since we didn't hear him talking, I think he enjoyed it. Bill ordered the Empanadas and he said they were good, they looked nice.... I ordered the F.O.T.E.S. eggs and when they arrived they were ice cold.... I was really looking forward to this dish and it was just a bit of a disappointment. Wentworth order the quiche and he said it was very nice. 

The bread they bring to the table at the beginning of the meal was apparently good - I never got any and the server never replenished the plate. The cornbread apparently was nice, but was not very flavourful and was a little overdone. 

We ordered more coffee, paid our bill and all in all it was OKAY - think we will try another place for brunch next time."}
{"text":"Best southern fried chicken.

It was battered and marinated just right, it was also cooked just right - very tender and no burnt bits.  And best of all, it was de-boned!  Like a chicken steak.  It also comes with an unusual mac and cheese, unusual in a very good way, and not heavy."}
{"text":"stopped by for an early bite prior to a movie... server was very courteous and on the ball... nice little patio out front... tried flatbread, mussels and empanadas to start... empanadas were blah... flat bread okay... mussels were imaginative but a miss... (onion ring and bbq sauce???)
i tried the jambalaya which was okay, but good feed back from the mahi mahi and salmon... fried chicken was okay... funny considering the chicken and the jambalaya were the go to items..."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this spot for an intimate date or smaller gathering. Tip: Best to make a reservation during peak times as this is a spot where people will take their time and enjoy.

The atmosphere and cuisine stand out for me here.

The atmoshere is intimate, romantic, and modern. Light lounge music, dim lighting, and candlelight.

We started with the Forest Mushroom Flatbread which was tasty. My main was the Bacon wrapped Beef Tenderloin which was cooked to perfection and presented so beautifully. I didn't think it could get better, until I ordered from their homemade dessert menu. The homemade cheesecake was to die for!

$125 for 2 plus tip."}
{"text":"we stumbled upon Fire on the East Side when we were actually looking for brunch on a Monday morning.  unfortunately they only do brunch on the weekends but fortunately this was a great find!

granted it was really empty on a Monday afternoon, the bar/restaurant was clean, quiet, dark and rather intimate.  the waitress was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. 

we ordered the smoked turkey and bacon wrap with guacamole and cheese with the soup of the day on the side.  we were the only people in the restaurant but the food came out rather slow.  

the soup of the day was a parsnip, pear, and apple puree/soup, lightly seasoned with pepper at the top.  it was an interesting mix of sweet with a slightly salty undertone and strong parsnip with apple-sauce-like aftertaste.  great for the first few bites, but the sweet/salty combination was a little sickening/weird near the end, especially because the soup was huge-- enough to be shared between two people.
the smoked turkey and bacon wrap on the other hand was perfect.  the wrap itself was toasted, crispy, and warm; the nicely melted cheese and guacomole added the right amount of moistness, as if the turkey wasn't juicy enough.  there was a good amount of bacon but not too much so that the saltiness wasn't overbearing.  this is hands down the best turkey, bacon, guac wrap i've ever eaten.  although not a unique wrap, it was very well made and memorable enough to make it stand out among all the wraps i've eaten in my life"}
{"text":"Came here a month or so ago and was really impressed. 
The interior has a really warm and cozy ambiance, and I like the row of tables in the front window. Only negative to the building itself is that the bathrooms are shared with a nightclub and are a bit sketchy in comparison to the rest of the experience. 

We sampled some apps and mains off the regular menu and the specials board. Everything was well prepared and delicious! I had the meatloaf as a main and although could've been a bit more generous in the thickness of the slice, it was really enjoyable in taste and the potato and turnip mash complimented it perfectly. 

Some quality craft brewed beers to choose from on tap and also rather tasty sangria as well which I imagine would taste even better on their patio in the summer. Looking forward to returning for another great meal!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night for some drinks and some food before going out to the bars.

Too bad I wasn't going to Fly that night, as I didn't realize we would be having dinner here.

I guess I've sort of been here many times without realizing it. This is the part of Fly that you have to walk through to go smoke. I always wondered what it was. 

So we were here at 9pm on Saturday nad it was pretty busy. The restaurant was pretty full with about 3 large parties (including us)

The drinks were not expensive, with all martini's priced @ 10 and all cocktails @ 8 

I ordered a Tequila Ceaser to start. Woof, did it have a kick! LOVED that it came with a snack aka tortilla chips in ma drankz. Totally would've just drank those all night and called those chips my dinner, but I didn't want to look like an alcoholic infront of my fellow dinners yo.

I gave in, and ordered the Jambalaya to eat. Boy, was I glad I did. I started devouring it right as I tasted it. Sooo good. 

A bed of spiced jasmine rice, with sausage, shrimp and a parade of mussels around the place. YUM. 

Other diners had:

1. The Tomato Tart : The person who ordered this thought it would be a small portion, but it turned out to be the largest. HUGE ASS TOMATO TART YO. 

2. The Southern Fried Chicken looked amazing too. 

3. The pasta was pasta.



Final Thoughts:

Towards the end of our meal, around 11, we started to hear the THUMPA THUMPA from Fly, which got me mad excited. 

Maybe next time I stay and sneak into fly and bypass the 20 dollar cover?"}
{"text":"There are lots of pricey, upscale restaurants in Toronto that cost a lot but deliver delicious food. 

Unfortunately, I'd have to say Fire on the East Side is not one of them. 

The layout of the restaurant is nice - a big upstairs area and a place you can rent out for parties. The downstairs has a large main room with a big open wall that opens up to a patio on the street. There are also some side tables and the restaurant is connected to Fly nightclub for those who feel like getting down after they chow down. 

The food is a sort of a mish-mash of spicy deep south USA cooking. A lot of Louisiana-style meals like jambalya and blackened chicken are on the menu. As I was on kind of a budget, I ordered their spinach salad for $11. I have to say I was pretty disappointed with it. It came with bacon, green beans. onions, peppers, feat cheese and mushrooms. 

But when it arrived at the table, it literally looked like they had just thrown some bacon on some spinach from a container. There were hardly any toppings and the salad was pretty small. For $11 I would have expected a little more food and some added flavour - I could have made that exact same salad at home for a 1/4 of the price.

For the price and service, I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner."}
{"text":"If you've ever been looking for a nice place to eat on Yonge (or just off), Fire on the East Side is hidden gem compared to many of the other locations in the area.

The location is just off Yonge so it's intimate and cozy but still convient to get to and the menu is Southern inspired which is a rare find in area and in most of Toronto. I mean I've got nothing against the million and one pseudo sushi bars along Yonge but sometimes it's nice to have a bit of variety.

It was too cold for the patio, which wasn't set up but the interior was nicely decorated and warm. I opted to add a Mac & Cheese to my main instead of a starter but a few friends ordered starters and it was nice to see there was enough to share.

The portions overall were pretty large, maybe a bit too large for me but I'm sure many would not complain. 

I had the Ribs and Mac & Cheese. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. The mac & cheese was the perfect addition, even tho it was penne instead of macaroni. The cheese sauce was delicious and the bread crumb topping was nice and crispy.

I probably could have done without the brussel sprouts but I've never been a brussel sprouts fan.

I was pretty full after my main but everyone was ordering dessert so it was nice to see a mini carrot cupcake option on the dessert menu. I do usually like to finish a meal with something sweet no matter how full I am and the carrot cupcake hit the spot.

Overall, I'd probably give Fire on the East Side, 3.5 stars if I could but since the area is lacking in good food options, and since we can't give 1/2 stars, I'd say 4 stars for great service, nice ambience, good food that isn't just a carbon copy of all the other menus in the area."}
{"text":"Two words for you; Mint Mojito. 

These two words are -all you need to know while heading to FotES for any meal of the day and I won't explain why -yours to discover. 

This is a fun, not particularly romantic or girly place to visit. Actually, I can't imagine a scenario that this venue wouldn't suit. 

The dinner and brunch menu offer the best variety and dishes. Service is always great and flawless.

I may pop by for appetizers and libations on my next visit."}
{"text":"Dreadful food and dreadful service. 
 I went to Fire on the East Side in May 2011 with a couple of girl friends. 

The appetizers were great but unfortunately the food and the service went downhil rapidly after that. 

I wanted to try the Cajan Mac and Cheese and it came as a special with Southern Fried Chicken is some kinda sauce.  It was all dreadfully salty (particulary the sauce on the chicken).  the portion was quite large which I don't consider a good thing. the Mac and Cheese was mediocre.

 But the the dessert.  Not much choice but I decided to try the cupcake with cream cheese icing.  I asked the waiter about the dessert and he obviously had no idea becaause from what he told me, I had expected and hoped for  for a small, soft, freshly baked cupcake with a little bit of icing. Not !  A large, dry muffin type of thing appeared (it could have fed two) and tasted like it was baked at least 2 days earlier.  The waiter assured me it was fresh that morning.  Right !!  He (they) took the muffins off the bill!

And the entree cost me $24.00 so it's not cheap.  I don't mind paying if I'm getting good food, good service and a knowledgeable server who seems interested in the client's needs.

To add insult to injury, one of my girlfriends threw up when she got home. She had had the same mac and cheese and chicken as I had.
A totally bad and inferior experience.  I hope never have to go there again and I would certainly not recommend it. In fact I have since discouraged people from eating there.

I am writing this  to warn possible new customers and also so the catering and serving staff at Fire on the East Side can take note to try and improve their menu and service.

Also I don't  think I have ever complained about a restaurant before so this makes it particularly bad.  

A local diner"}
{"text":"Fire on the East side is a gem of a place just off noisy, dusty Yonge Street. The decor is well done--very chic, yet not unwelcoming The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, though it can take some time for food to come out of the kitchen. The food never disappoints and is often really delicious. On my most recent excursion I tried the Cajun mac n cheese. I wasn't expecting much--I usually prefer my mac n cheese to be unadulterated--i.e., macaroni + cheese--but this slightly spicy variation was creamy, with a bit of a crunch and a little bite. The only thing I didn't really like was what looked like a nest of deep-fried bacon on top. I know: how can I possibly complain about deep-fried bacon? But it was just too crispy and fused together and was difficult to eat, with little taste. It might not have been bacon, but I couldn't really tell from the taste what it was. My guests tried the salmon--nothing left on the plate--and a salad with tofu, which I wouldn't have gone near with a four-foot fork, but she seemed to enjoy it.

I recommend FOTES for brunch as well. Again, the food is delicious, and their homemade hot sauce for your eggs is a real treat.

I keep meaning to try FOTES on a night when they really open up the bar and the place, which is at the edge of the village, really gets lively.

Oh--one of the nicest patios in the area, too."}
{"text":"As a fan of a good brunch meal, Fire On The East Side definitely settles my breakfast cravings and my search for good service!

I have only been there twice for brunch but what I experienced both times was pure delicious food and a nice reception from the staff.

First off, they always offer you warm banana bread with butter and a large choice of a hot beverage of several teas or rich coffee or a fruity selection of your typical breakfast juices, freshly squeezed.

I have only tried the mixed berry pancakes there and a feta cheese and spinach omelette but both dishes were perfection. The fluffy pancakes just melted in my mouth with their sweet buttery berry taste, topped with Canadian maple syrup. The omelette was cooked up with all of the toppings embedded into the dish, creating a great blend of flavour.

I admit that I have not tried this place for any other meal but for a brunch spot, it is yummy and is in the heart of downtown. What a delicious combo!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe. Friendly staff. Food was pretty good. Service was a little slow.  Good place for a couple drinks with breakfast."}
{"text":"solid 4 stars

one of my favorite things in the world is having brunch on a patio on a breezy sunny day (before noon so i feel productive!) and thats what we did over the weekend (except breezy. more like humidity!!)  

i admit, i like cutesy little french brunch cafes more than modern looking brunch restaurants. so judging books by its cover, i didnt have much expections. and maybe thats why i was so pleasantly surprised . they first gave us some banana bread. kinda like they do at dinners. except its banana bread, more breakfast-y! i dont even like banana bread and i finished it all. so good! i ordered the smoked salmon & arugula egg benny . NOT what i was expecting at all! to be honest, i was expecting something on par w cora's . its sooo much better than cora's. i liked how they used cornbread for the bennys instead of english muffins . oh and their fries. mmmm their fries were pretty good!!

i refuse to sit inside when the weathers warm enough in toronto to sit outside. we dont get that too often!! but still, it was soooo hot & sticky that day. i asked the server if they had ice coffee instead of hot coffee, which they didnt BUT he made it just for me :) OH . i realized this after we were served but there is a little space INSIDE, RIGHT beside the patio... kinda like a sunroom. i was so envious since the 2 tables there gets the best of both worlds, patio & the A/C. something to remember for next time :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here. Have been here for both brunch, lunch, and dinner. Food was great at all times. They have the best crab cakes benedict that comes with a nice side of banana bread. The burgers are also one of the best I've tried. Great prices as well. Had the short ribs for dinner and it was really tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch sometimes, always get the fried chicken sandwich, chipotle mayo and sweet potato fries, always delicious. 

The other food my friends ate was also very good (burger, grilled chicken) this place has everything done right from the bread to the sauce to the meat texture. 

Not a whole lot of southern restaurants in this city, but this one does very well for itself."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I came here twice in the span of a week. Once was purely out of convenience b/c it was near the apartment and another was b/c a couple friends suggested coming here for lunch. 
I ordered the pulled pork poutine and the grilled plaintains (both under the appetizers section). I asked the waitress if it would be too much and she reassured me that it was going to be fine. Boy was I surprised when the order came out! The pulled pork poutine was served in a large white bowl that could feed two people (for their entree). The plaintains were tapas sized. The pulled pork poutine was pretty delicious but I got sick of it after a while. (I barely grazed the top of the dish! That was how enormous this was!) The plaintains were lightly salted and served with yogurt. I loved the mix of salty and sweet were combined in the plaintains w/ an added bonus of the creamy yogurt. 
The second time I came, I ordered the Tilapia po'boy. I ordered the salad on the side b/c its fried fish served on a cheesy biscuit so I opted out of the fries. The fried fish was a little to done but still delicious, however, the cheesy biscuit was on the dry side which was unfortunate. The salad was pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"I celebrated an excellent birthday brunch at Fire on the East Side. I made reservations a few days before for 8 people, but in the end, only 4 confirmed. This wasn't a problem for the staff. I was pleased to see a table ready for 8, but they adjusted very quickly for us.

We waited a bit for a waiter, but after placing our orders, we didn't have to wait too long for food.

Cornbread-based bennies?! Why hadn't I ever tried that before? It was awesome.

I can tell you that 3 out of the 4 of us didn't get food poisoning later that day, and while I can't automatically blame the huevos rancheros (because 2 ppl ordered it), my friend swears that it was from brunch. yikes."}
{"text":"Fire on the East Side is defined by 3 Bs: 
Banana bread
Beautiful servers
Bennies

In all my years of living right beside Yonge street's most fabulous brunch resto, I've never had a bad experience. If you come later on a weekend morning, there is bound to be the typical brunch wait, but it's never that bad. 

With banana bread to start, it always tides over the hungry soul. I've tried everything on the menu and am partial to the crab cake benny when I'm starving and the turkey sweet potato hash when I'm feeling healthy. The home frites are absolutely delicious and a McCartney mimosa (orange, cranberry and mango juices) always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for dinner with friends to close to both the Bloor and Yonge lines, outside of stuffy Yorkville, so FotES fit the bill.  Glanced at a menu ahead of time and saw the margaritas were on special for $6, making it an easy to persuade my friends that this was a good choice.

Arrived at 6:30pm on Tuesday and it wasn't terribly busy - maybe just over 1/3 full.  Mind you, it was also a crappy crappy rainy day.  Sitting down I had a flashback to a few years ago when I had taken my parents here for brunch.  I remembered it being tasty so I was getting excited...

Started with margaritas, which were perfect.  Not too sweet, and you could tell they was a generous pour.  I opted for the Mango which was excellent and my friends were raving about the classic as well.  Ended up with a second round, this time Palomas, which were equally delicious.  

Onto food.  We ordered, to share: jambalaya, rissotto, fried chicken, and mac n cheese.  My friends both liked the jambalaya best.  It was very tasty and contained some really juicy prawns (as well as chicken, chorizo, and mussels), but the dish was a little mild on the spice/heat for me (mind you, my spicy hot tolerance is VERY high).  I was all about the fried chicken!  It was boneless/skinless but still so juicy and crispy. MMM.  And I don't even particularly like chicken!  Rissotto was tasty but not particularly exciting so I wouldn't order it again.  The mac and cheese was a bland disappointment, so definitely skip it!

Finished off the meal with a shared pecan tart.  It was flaky and delicious.  Mmm.  

Including tax and tip, the meal came to $45 per person which got us each 1/3 of an appie, an entree, 1/3 of dessert, and 2 drinks. So, pretty reasonable considering the quality.

All in all I loved this place.  It's a cute atmosphere, perfect for catching up over cocktails.  There's a patio that looked like it would be amazing on a sunny day.  I would definitely come back.  My only complaint is that the service was SLOW.  I mean the place was not busy at all but it took forever for the waiter to come around and ask if we needed a second drink or whether we wanted dessert.  This meal spanned 3 hours!  It was fine for us because we weren't in a rush, but it's something to be aware of if you plan on visiting."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years, and I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about it.  I think it's a 3 or even a 4* for brunch, but not much better than a 2* for dinner.

Although I would go back again for brunch, last night may have been my last dinner here.  We were in a group for a friend's birthday (only 8 of us - not a huge group) and while we were definitely there to enjoy a leisurely meal (not expecting to be in and out in an hour or anything), the wait times were unsatisfactory.  This included a delay in getting drinks (in some cases over 20 minutes) as well as food.  The food itself is pretty decent, but not amazing (last night I had the short ribs as well as the fried chicken).  The atmosphere is fun and the service is pleasant, both at brunch and at dinner."}
{"text":"We sat outside and enjoyed a shandy made with an organic Mill St lager followed by salads and meat loaf.   The meat loaf is excellent, very large portion,  we shared it between the two of us.   Service was great and we will return and try their buttermilk chicken."}
{"text":"I like this place! I have visited for weekend brunch and also for dinner.

BRUNCH
I came on a Sunday ~11:30 and only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two. The place was hoppin' and Salt'n'Pepa was blaring on the stereo. They have lots of juices beyond your regular apple and orange, and they come in S/M/L. I had a pineapple juice, yum! So many things on the menu sounded tempting (frittata... breakfast poutine...) but I decided to be health-conscious and go for the 'Healthy Scramble'. It's an egg white scrambled with creamy goat cheese loaded with fresh vegetables (asparagus, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, shallots). Deelish! It came with toast and fresh fruit. Service was a little off in terms of timing, but our server was really friendly. 

DINNER
Came back for dinner with a Groupon. My DC and I had dinner on the patio, which was really nice. The patio is non-smoking. I really like this, because I like to sit outside when the weather's nice, but sitting next to a table where everyone is smoking kinda makes me lose my appetite. Actually, there was a couple in the next table and at one point the guy really wanted to have a smoke. So he had to walk around and stand on the sidewalk (outside the fence) to have his cigarette. 
Anyways, I arrived before my DC and ordered a rasberry mojito, which was refreshing. Maybe there could have been a little more fresh mint, but all in all, a decent mojito. The drinks menu in general is pretty extensive with lots of interesting sounding fruity cocktails, martinis, wine, and sangria. 
They have a daily soup special and on this evening, they had 2 burger specials -- a turkey burger and a veggie burger. My DC had the turkey burger and it looked fantastic. I had the Eastside Chopped Salad, which was solid but not too exciting. Just romaine, ham, chick peas, cheese, and corn in a vinaigrette. I also got a side order of  the cajun mac and cheese, which was great! The spiciness added a nice kick and the portion was actually pretty big. Some of the prices seem weird to me. It costs $5 extra if you want to add tofu to your salad, yet a nice dish of mac and cheese on the side is only $6? They didn't bring us any bread while we were waiting, but that's probably a good thing because we were both really full. 
Our server was very laid-back and cool, although slow to bring us the bill. We had no problems using the Groupon and even though many places do not let you include alcohol (the Groupon said it was just for food), he included our mojitos as part of the discount. 

In summary, FOES is a standout place for brunch and a pretty good dinner spot too. This place is friendly, easy-going, and reliable. 

P.S. They share washrooms with FLY nightclub next door."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 7 and we all loved it.  The portion sizes are nice and big and the food tastes great.  I had the eggs Bennie with crab cakes.  One other person in our group had a chicken sandwich which he absolutely loved.  Said he would come back just for this item.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the coffee was a bit watered down.  Also the wait time for our food was a tad on the long side side (we came for Sunday brunch and the place was pretty full to be fair)."}
{"text":"Yelp is great for patrons to share experiences with others about.  I always thought it would be amazing if owners used the site to find out what their customers really think about them, and considered that information as part of their business planning.

Well, Ian at Fire on the East Side is one of those owners.  I was blown away to receive a message from him about my post.  His message was positive and thankful for the feed back, and let me know about some menu changes coming up.

WOW!  I will definitely be going back.  Brunch anyone?"}
{"text":"Came here on two occasions- brunch and lunch.

Get there early for brunch because it gets pretty busy quick.  I love the free banana bread!  I had the chicken quesadilla and the hubby ordered the crab cakes benny.  Equally delicious!  The quesadilla had a distinct taste which I can't quite pinpoint.  Crab cakes were cooked well and were a good size.

For lunch, the hubby had the pulled pork sandwich, which was nice and juicy and the bbq sauce was tangy.  I had the tilapia po boy on a cheese biscuit.  The biscuit was way too huge and a little too crumbly for my liking.  I wouldn't have eaten the fish had I eaten the entire biscuit.  The fish is battered but still tasty.  

The garden salad here is amazing!  I love the sweet from the candied pecans and the slightly sour from the vinaigrette.  I had never finished a garden salad until I ate here.

Not baby friendly (no high chairs) but the service was more than friendly and they did everything they could to accommodate us.

Strong contender in the brunch department."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice if you want something classy and casual in the downtown core! I'm not a fan of brunch/breakfast food so I thought I'd try the dinner menu here.  I ordered the half chicken with corn fritters and green beans. The portion was more than generous but everything was really delicious so I left feeling pretty full in spite of my usual restraint. 

Next time I will have to try a few of the appetizers - there are several tempting options and these would make a great meal in and of themselves.

The patio seating is really lovely here and i like that the front facing window opens up onto the patio so you can sit inside without feeling totally closed off. I thought the staff here were really attentive and friendly. The bathrooms are downstairs - watch your step!"}
{"text":"Excellent location for the brunch, service was alright. I ordered crab cake benny ($14), I find the crab cake too salty, size of  the salad is small, fries taste stale and eggs are over poached! (Noooo~~), came with a group of 5, only one person got a running egg york, the rest are half solid egg york. Coffee is alright but not the best and its using those packaged milk and creamer. I prefer the fresh type. The first batch of the coffee was cold so had to get the waiter to change to a new hot one.

The verdict: The egg benny was a fail, but the ambience was good, and it was not too buzy for sunday brunch."}
{"text":"We went here after dinner, simply for drinks. I wanted a cocktail and my sister recommended this place. 

Good choice mon soeur! 

This cute little bar has nice, clean decor, with some interesting touches, such as a large, metal cross on one wall, that I was a big fan of. 

The service was great and the drinks were a good size and were excellent. My husband had scotch and said it was very smooth (that's more a comment on what they offer, as opposed to bar tending), but my sister and my cocktails were great. They are about average price for cocktails, but the size makes it feel more worth it ($10 for our 3 oz drinks), in large martini glasses. 

We didn't have food here, but I would be interested in coming back some time and giving it a try!"}
{"text":"The owner contacted me and showed concern about my bad experience. He said that the Sunday I came in for brunch, they had a staffing problem in the kitchen and that is why the food took so long to come out. He also apologized on behalf of his server for not being friendly/apologizing for the wait. I give him props for reaching out to his reviewers in order to try and correct his restaurant's problems! =) I will definitely give it another shot the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's day as has become tradition (or so it seems). We made a reservation and it was fairly busy the night we came in. Lots of people having drinks and apps and just hanging out. We were seated in the corner (our usual table) and perused the menu.

Not much has changed here on the menu and my family and I agreed that its time they overhaul the menu and make some changes because we're running out of new things to try. We had wanted to try the herb potato chips but were told they were sold out - very sad! We got the daily mussels which had collard greens, white wine and shallots and an order of the scallops, everything to share. I ordered the fried chicken this time as I've been eyeballing it for quite a while and its still on the menu.

The mussels were good but not the best mussels we've had here. The sauce was good but it lacked a little something. The scallops were quite good, I could have eaten an entire order just myself and I would have been happy. My fried chicken was unexpected. You know what you expect when you get fried chicken? Yeah, throw that idea right out the window and prepare to be blown away. Two chicken thighs, pounded (?) long and thin, breaded and then fried to a nice dark brown, placed on top of a bed of mashed potatoes, with some kind of gravy between and collard greens sandwiched in there too. I didn't really get any garlic off the garlic mashed potatoes but the entire plate was so well put together, I ate the entire thing. It was a good sized portion but I couldn't stop myself. 

For dessert I got the fritters which were excellent. Hot, dense and rich with whipped cream on the side, I couldn't finish them by myself so my dad and brother helped me polish them off. These are a must-have if you come here.

Overall, great meal, hoping to see some menu changes in the future but definitely tasty food!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and based on reviews and how busy the place was, I expected great things, but I received pancakes that were anything but tender, and to call them blueberry pancakes was insulting... they were plain pancakes with a handful of blueberries thrown on the plate!

Hubby had the Crab Cake Benny, which was ok, but not much hollandaise, and the crab cake was a bit fishy tasting.  

The most insulting part of the meal was that I ordered sausage to have with my pancakes... it was the kind of sausage you would get from a hot dog cart... nothing like a breakfast sausage!

The waitress was friendly, but took a while to get coffee refills.

After having brunch last week at The House on Parliament which was fantastic, I doubt we will be back to Fire on the East Side for Brunch, nor dinner.

I was originally going to try and go back for dinner for the Fried Chicken, but reading that it is a cutlet killed that idea... I keep searching for real authentic southern fried chicken... I have found it as far north as Saratoga Springs New York, but seems not in Canada.

Oh well, we have poutine!

PS - I realize it was free, so I shouldn't complain, but the banana bread they brought to the table before the meal was terribly dry and did not taste like bananas... more cinnamon taste than anything, but I guess because I make a mean banana bread, I am a tough critic! 

:P"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for Saturday brunch. The place is conducive for catching up and the noise level is just enough to be able to carry a good conversation. Service is excellent and they give you delicious banana bread while waiting for your orders. It may take a while but when you're with friends and chatting away, that could even be an advantage so you can talk more before stuffing your mouth. I loved my traditional eggs benny which came with salad and tasty home frites. My friends also enjoyed their crab bennies and the pancakes sure looked extra fluffy. We stayed for more than 2 hours and yet we never felt rushed by the staff. We really enjoyed the experience. I tried coming again on a weekday to try the crab benny and/or pancakes but was disappointed to find out that they only have them on weekends. Why oh why?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening for a casual meet-up with some foxy Yelpers and dinner. Service was slow at first being that I was first of my party to arrive, I'd  waited awhile to be seated.  There were only two waitstaff/bartenders working both the main and second floor, but eventually I was ushered into the cozy main room.  The decor is very conducive to a romantic outting, all drapes and dim lighting, very intimee indeed. The server was very sympatico as he explained the specials and also mentions that on Mondays Martini's are $6. Although we did not order libations the server was still very attentive and made sure that the citrus tinged water was in good supply.

My meal started off with crab cakes. They arrive quite charred and dark, unlike the ones pictured online that are nicely golden brown.  I was famished however so in my mouth they went regardless of their ineptitude.  Flavourwise they were fair with a nice kick of chipotle, texturally however the inner contents of the crab cake took on a more mushy tuna salad consistency and made me feel like one should be sandwiching these cakes between bread instead of enjoying them as an appetizer.  

My main entree is the Spaghetti Squash 'Pasta' with a mixture of kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes and feta in basil/pesto sauce.  To be fair this is my first time having a squash pasta meal outside my own kitchen, but it was rather bland and nothing of great substance.  My lovely companion Chris P who ordered the 'Fire' Banquet Home Burger remarked on it's excellence while she savoured it with ardent relish.

The bathrooms at FOTES are shared with Fly nightclub downstairs and atmospherically take on an industrial vibe.  Sadly there were no encounters with any sweaty hardbodies thrusting emphatically to raging trance tunes as it was only a Monday night :(

 I can't say it was much of a moving experience at FOTES, however I do think it is worth a return visit as previous Yelpers have mentioned that the brunch served here far exceeds their dinner savoire-faire. Fire is a great place for an intimate get-together for drinks or brunch, just don't place all your bets here for dinner."}
{"text":"Both the food and service was excellent. We  both ended up trying the Chipotle turkey sweet potato hash. Amazing. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Oh. my. god.  I bring my parents here.  I bring my friends here.  I would bring my cats here if I could... although I can't imagine they'd get much out of it, seeing as there is no menu for the kitties (but I think they DO have a small thing for kids).  I usually come here for brunch, which is incredibly incredible.  I've done dinner at FOTES, as my dad likes to call it... that was also very tasty.

For brunch, I usually get the Crab Cakes Benedict and it's just to die for.  Seriously.  I could go on and on and on about the menu items but I think it would suffice to say that everything is mouth-watering and delicious.

As one of my friends says, they serve bacon with EVERYTHING.  Salad, would you like bacon with that?  Fries, would you like bacon with that?  Bacon, would you like bacon with that?

Beware - if you come here, you may never do brunch anywhere else again."}
{"text":"Fire on the East Side (FOTES) is the kind of place that I should really like, yet continually disappoints. A frequent spot for failure-to-launch first brunch dates, and send-offs for barely-noticed co-workers, FOTES promises big southern-style flavours on the menu, but fails to ignite on the palate. 

I'll say up front, my favourite thing about FOTES is their water. Served from an ice-cold pitcher, it's spiked with citrus. Good for me, bad for the resto, since I don't feel the need to order a beverage. Service is polite and accommodating, though not memorable. 

The food itself is branded Southern, with detours into Cajun county. in practice, this means a lot of deep-fried chicken, which is pleasant but bland.

Brunch is the best thing going. Eggs benny are properly poached in water, not microwave radiation; hollandaise is sunny; peameal bacon arrives overdone, but that's how I like it. Salad accompanies most plates. Uniform mixed greens in uniform sweet vinaigrette. Why do Toronto restaurants think that salad pairs well with dessert topping? Still, the scambled eggs are fluffy, the roast potatoes golden outside and creamy inside (although you're better off ditching them for worthwhile frites)

Lunch is meh (squared). a gumbo starter is less Mardi Gras on the toungue than ash wednesday; no heat, no salt, no texture beyond stingy grains of rice, slimy okra and the odd overcooked bit of mystery seafood. 

 Crabcakes are just ok; thin shreds of seafood lost in old-bay heavy breading, rather than gorgeous clumps of knuckle meat. 

An Angus burger is OK, but overcooked to toughness. It could be saved by the fat from the cheese, if only there were more than a teaspoon. Ditto for the pulled pork, which tastes as though it \"fell off the bone\" a while ago, and has spent the last while toughening in a warming tray. 

Mainstream media teaches me that Southern cooking is all about warmth, family, and heart-stopping portions of fat and carbs. Cajun cooking should add a layer of heat and tasty pork/seafood to the party. FOTES should be a riot of flavour. Too often, it just leaves me cold."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to have brunch at FOTES ever since the EPIC Yelp Elite party there last year (Mojitos! Hey!)

We scored a seat on the patio for Sunday brunch after a short wait at the bar inside. (Definitely worth the wait for patio seating)

Our server was nice and brought out a pitcher of water and some free banana bread to get us started. 

I tried the FOTES eggs (2 poached eggs served in a dish with fresh salsa, black beans and guacamole). They came with some fries and a side salad. Food was very delicious and the eggs were cooked perfectly (I asked for soft boiled). $12.

My friends seemed equally enthusiastic about their food. 

Good brunch cocktail selection too although I thought my friend's mimosa was overpriced - $8 and served in a small champagne flute. 

Bill was brought out promptly upon request. Smooth service and great food, great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Crab cake benedict - get it.

Came here for brunch on a Sunday. We forgot to make reservation, but we were seated promptly at the patio on a beautiful sunny day.
Our server was friendly and mostly available. 
My mimosa was delicious; coffee was not as good as I remembered it to be, but the crab cake was AMAZING. A small hitch was that I asked for my eggs to be poached dry, but it came out wet anyway. They took my plate away and I was sad while everyone else waited. The food was worth the wait though. 

Oh and the sweet potatoe fries...yum...

I love this place."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for a long weekend and we went to Fire on the East Side twice. (We liked it so much on Saturday, we came back on Sunday). Very nice restaurant with outdoor seating. The staff is super friendly. Everything we had was great for Brunch. Steak and Eggs, Stuffed French Toast, Bennies, Omlettes. The pricing was reasonable also. If your near downtown Toronto hit this place for Brunch. I am sure the other meals are good also."}
{"text":"I'm new in Toronto, and yeah really fresh in Yelp too, but yesterday I went to Fire with some friends and I have to say we had a really good time.
First the waiter was reading my friend's mind, he always knew what she wanted even before she asked for it (weird and funny).
We had Guinness and mojitos, and some snacks that I forgot to take a picture.
Wasn't expensive for what we had and is a really nice place to go as a couple too.
5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent place to spend my anniversary.  I had made reservations but it wasn't necessary as we had our pick of seats out on the patio.  They have a decent sized patio with about 10 tables.  Being just off Younge street you would expect a lot of traffic noise but they are far enough that you can enjoy a romantic evening on a warm summer evening without the hustle and bustle of the tourist crowds.

Because it was Sunday they had Sangria on special for $5 a glass or $18 a pitcher and a choice of red or white.  We opted for a pitcher of red which was just enough for the two of us to enjoy with out dinner.

They had a set summer menu (competing with Summerlicious) for $25 a person which had excellent choices.  I started with the soup of the day which was a watermelon gazpacho with poppy seeds.  The soup was very flavorful and creamy and had a hint of heat as it maybe had some chili powder or something in it.  My wife started with the stuffed jalapeños topped with mango chutney.  My taste of them was delicious, the mango offset the spiciness quite well but wasn't too sweet.  

For the main dishes I had the blackened steak with chipotle seasoned salsa and a cornbread muffin.  The steak was well seasoned and the cornbread perfectly moist.  My wife had the asparagus risotto with Atlantic salmon.  The risotto had a creamy, buttery-ness unlike I've ever tasted.  The salmon was excellently cooked and without that fishy taste you can sometimes get.  For dessert we both had the bread pudding with chocolate and raspberry puree.  The best part of the dessert was finding a warm chunk of white chocolate hidden in the middle.

The staff were really friendly and engaged.  Our server regularly checked in to make sure everything was ok, but wasn't intrusive.  

Overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch, ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese side. The decor in the place is nice, but the washroom looked like one straight out of a strip club. There was some shady business down there, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a night club in the place.

Anyways, the food was pretty good. The sandwich was yummy. But I think it was frozen? The meat was stonecold in the middle. The mac and cheese was filling, it's thick and tasty. It also came with some carrot garnishes, although I think a white carrot is pretty suspicious...

Overall this gets 5 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 people for a birthday. The food was pretty good, I tried the chicken and waffles. Our server was friendly and available. The place is small, but I like the intimacy for a more private occasion. Curious to try their brunch, have heard good things about it."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious (brunch) food.

I felt so-so about my drink order - just tasted watery.  Coffee refills were prompt & the server was welcoming to the entire party (baby included)
Fun atmosphere & was a great time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and this is one of my favourite places for brunch, especially if you get a table on their nice front patio. Good for dinner too.

There's something magical about the food in this place. No matter what I've ordered, every bite is a festival of flavours in my mouth. Love it!

Although a bit on the pricier side, the service is excellent and the portions are a fair size.

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fire On The East Side is one of the first places that comes to mind when I want a fancy experience but don't want to have to follow dress code or spend my whole paycheque on a meal. I've been to FOTES for birthday dinners and brunch and each experience was fabulous. 

For dinner, I recommend taking a look at the specials and perhaps combining several \"appetizer portions\" of their more popular items, like baked mac & cheese, spicy fries, etc. They also have drink specials throughout the week.

Brunch is bustling and always a treat - while you peruse the menu, you're served slices of warm banana bread (!). Yummy. I recommend the French Toast special, which was served stuffed with peaches and mascarpone cheese, or straight up Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Just went back here last weekend for the first time in a year. I have to say, I use to recommend this place like crazy to everyone but now...I dont know what happened. The service was incredibly slow. The servers, the food...and to make it worse there was about 5 servers who were just hanging out by the bar area. Do some work! I ordered the turkey hash, it was still as delicious as before but the portion got really small. My mom ordered the chorizo omelet, the portion was huge and it was good. Nothing special. She could have made a better one. My brothers had ok meals. I hope I just went on a bad day or something because this place used to be my top go-to place."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and though this would be a good place for brunch before heading to the airport.  The location is great and the restaurant quaint.   In the warm months it would be great to sit outside and people watch. Service was good.  

However, the food was just ok.  I had the special spicy cabbage soup and spicy turkey hash.   The soup had a real bitter taste to it which surprised me.  The hash was underdone.   The other dish we tried was pancakes with a apple-blackberry compote.  It was ok.  The sausage served with it ok, but a little on the dry side."}

Items Ordered: Mojito ($6) Old-Bay Angus Meatballs ($9)

My ex coworkers and I decided to catch up at this venue for their 4-7 happy hour, which was also Mojito Wednesdays night. It was a hot day and we wanted to take advantage of the blazing sun but their whole patio was completely blocked with umbrellas. When asked to take down an umbrella they said it cannot be done. Strike 1. (Nonetheless we sat outside until it got too cold so we eventually moved our party indoors.)

The waiter came around and I really wanted to try the 'Very Berry Mojito' but the waiter informed us that it wasn't part of the specials. Strike 2. 

The specials included 4 other varieties: Raspberry, Strawberry, Citrus or Coconut. I got the coconut and it was pretty good. Nothing bad to say.  

Later we learned that happy hour also included vino, it wasn't clear which vino. Even their website reads 'Monday thru Thursday; Reduced prices on hi-balls, wine, bottled beer and draught' not specifying which wine or beer, although it definitely doesn't cover all of them, talking from experience here.    

For food I ordered the angus meatballs served with tomato sauce, shaved grano padano and fresh basil. They were juicy, tender, portion size was good. Overall, I was satisfied. The sourdough bread for the table came with a lovely smoky, sweet chutney which was really good. Only after we placed all our orders and began eating did we notice the specials written on the chalk board inside, which our waiter failed to mention. Strike 3. 

I mean this place is nothing special, now that I have been I have no desire to go back beyond happy hour. However, Sunday is their Sangria night, glass for $6/ pitcher for  $20 from 4pm to close. I am intrigued."}
