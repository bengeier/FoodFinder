{"text":"We went there for lunch today. It wasn't that busy during lunch hour and the service was good. 

I ordered ??????????? (Okra Kimchi Fried Rice) and it was the best fried rice I've ever ate in Toronto so far. Highly recommended. 

Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Bad service. Ordered food and drinks, paid upfront and was promptly kicked out when we were only half finished our meal."}
{"text":"Friend and I wanted to try something different (both of us been to GUU and love it), but were in the area. The atmosphere was nice and the sight of Japanese people made us think \"GEEE this place must be awesome, even Japanese people are coming to eat here\". However, I think the Japanese patrons were really there for their impressive list of sake and were smart enough to not eat here b/c we were thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food and service. It was so disappointing that we will NEVER come back here again. 

Quality of Food - It wasn't great. The food wasn't exactly fresh (i.e. half egg filled with bland egg salad w/a cold piece of bacon sticking from the side of it) and it wasn't exactly unique. GUU definitely is worth the wait as the food is always fresh and tasty. Nothing we had exactly made an impression on us. We left feeling hungry!

Hygiene - We were seated at the bar. We had a full view of the kitchen and the chefs preparing the food. The chef responsible for making udon kept sampling the food to see if it was ready (nothing wrong with that but if you made it a billion times, shouldn't you know approximately when it is ready). What REALLY disgusted us was the chef who marinated the ginger chicken (it was decent - not really as crispy as you would expect deep friend chicken, and nothing you couldn't get else where) with his hands, which we are pretty sure he didn't wash. Have they heard of a thing called SALMONELLA? Definitely saw him touching cooking utensils and frying pans w/out washing them. The kitchen is getting old, despite them just opening in last year or so and just really unappealing to patrons sitting at the bar. 

Quality of Service - Nice staff but too short-staffed and not attentive. Our waitress couldn't speak english (nothing wrong with that), but was distracted throughout our order b/c she was too focused on the dishes being served. We also tried to pay, but the interact machine failed to receive a signal. Waiter went away, we assumed he was trying to fix the problem, but then we saw him doing other stuff. Shouldn't he come back to tell me what the situation was? Finally, a waitress assisted us after me complaining and she said wireless was not working. She told me to use the ATM in the restaurant (NO - I'm not paying the fee) or wait for 20 minutes until it works again.  I told her that neither of those options were viable, and within 1 minute, she got the machine to work again. Makes me wonder if there was even a problem. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT (esp if you are going for food, can't speak for the sake). Go somewhere else for authentic Japanese tapas food (GUU now has 2 locations) b/c we left feeling hungry and $$ wasted down the drain."}
{"text":"Craving for bomb Japanese skewers tonight, So drop by at Don Don izakaya,  first time here And the food is actually not bad.."}
{"text":"Best izakaya ever! We had a great time. Really feels like you're transported to Japan. Great food, great drinks, and great service! They really make you feel welcome when you come in, it's so much fun!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed...left hungry with $60 less in our wallet.

We went with friends just after it opened. The ambiance is neat with the beating drums, but that's about the best that I can say about Don Don. And for many, this becomes annoying. The food was not impressive. We tried the hot dog with kimchi (so-so), blackened potato croquettes (bland), beef stir-fried with onions on rice (pretty good). The torched salmon sashimi was different, may be the most memorable food dish we had. To top it all off, unfortunately our beer glasses were a little skunky. Nothing beer couldn't mask, I suppose. 

DonDon was not bon bon. Sorry, I would not return."}
{"text":"For a first visit on a friday night 8pm for 5 people we go seats right away. 
First of all - Great atmosphere. Service was friendly...a bit manic perhaps but good. 
We order three rounds of the Trio sake tasting - 2 of he $9 one and  one of $15. Reasonably priced for someone looking to get a taste of sake. 

We ordered a  number of dishes but the ones that stood out from the plethora of deep -fried items were 
- wasabi flavoured tampura seaweed,  the Black Croquets, Japanese hot dog, spicy shrimp and okra, pork buns and the deep fried avocado. 

Total was $165 for 5 people and the consensus was its decent for a impromptu group outing on a friday night."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch with a party of two. The bar atmosphere was fun and casual, seemed like it could be a great drinking spot on weekends.

The food, however, was a complete let down. 
Dishes were bland, served cold, and were definitely not fresh.

We ordered chicken and beef bento boxes for lunch, with a plate of assorted sashimi and avocado & salmon sushi rolls. The fish was not fresh and lacked in flavour, the tempura batter was dry and heavy, and the quality of the meat used for the chicken bento was subpar.

The service was horrible, we had to walk over to our server multiple times to place our order and get her attention. Incredibly rude considering that there were only two other tables eating in the restaurant at the time.

Overall, Id say skip it and go to Guu"}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday last Friday night. It was my third time at DonDon, and I love the environment more and more each time. With such a big group, we had the chance to dine in the big room in the back (where we had to remove our shoes). It was a very interesting experience. 

I had a dinner planned with my coworkers prior to this late dinner at DonDon, so I did not order much. Wish I had a bigger appetite though... The menu is extensive! Half the menu was drinks, the other half was full of pictures of food with descriptions in both English and Japanese. It was quite overwhelming... Our friends ended up focusing only on the items with a picture that had \"recommended\" or \"popular\" written over them. 

The Polar Beer was a bit disappointing. I expected the foam at the top to be completely frozen, but it tasted more like beer slushy. It also made a huge mess because the beer dripped all around the mug. 

The only items I ordered to go with my beer were the Spicy Grilled Squid and 5 Skewers Combo (with salt). The grilled squid is nothing special, as with most of the skewers, but the pork belly was really good. 

As for dessert, the Green Tea Mousse with Red Bean was all right, but the Taro Potato ice cream really tasty -- it's definitely something I would order again! 

Throughout the entire night, the servers were all very friendly and welcoming. The service was not amazing though as one of us kept having to peek out or even step out of the room to wave a server down every time we needed something. Perhaps it was only because we were situated in the back room? In any case, I do want to come back to give the rest of their food a try, like the Jaja-Beef. I never realized they give you a grill and let you grill the beef and vegetables to your own liking. How cool is that?"}
{"text":"The rice is terrible. The second time I went to this restaurant the rice were so sticky and lumped that it looks they were glued together. i complained to the manager and he brushed it off aside as Japanese rice.That shows unprofessional conduct on the part of the manager. I will never go to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Can usually rely on this place to have seatings, and their specials are well priced with the pitcher of Sapporo.

Food, lots of varieties to choose from but I find their skewers over salty everytime I've been there -- that just makes the Beer that much more refreshing though."}
{"text":"It has been a huge disappointment. As this was an attractive place from far across the street the food is no match for its intricately designed interior. 
We ordered the tasteless Tokyo style hot dog.  Aside from the teriyaki sauce and mayo, I did not find any flavor of a sausage or a hot dog in my pallet.  Not to mention the bun was just an ordinary grocery store commercially made bun. 
We also had steam shabu shabu.  My goodness what a waste of my time to even eat that thing.  (don't mean to be that negative, but u can tell the disappointment.)   It's no more than a couple of chopped mushroom and veg covered with just 4 pieces of bacon. No condiment was added. It only came with 2 little bowl of dipping sauce WHICH we identify as a certain purchase brand.  
There were others as well, but it was not at all impressive. It's quite hard for us to recall the goods when there were quite a few of really bads. 
Overall I was really disappointed as it doesn't live up to its name and precious reviews. I would definitely skip this place and would not think twice in hopping in line for G_ u !"}
{"text":"Casual and trendy place playing mainstream J-pop hits from m-flo to AKB48 and offering well-priced bento lunch and 'tapas' styled dinner.

Lunch: (4.5/5 stars)
I ordered the Take Box with salmon. It comes with salad, miso soup, kansai-styled sushi, petit tempura shrimp and chicken croquette for $13. Both the sushi and tempura were excellent, but the croquette had only potato and no chicken! The grilled salmon portion was small but the terriyaki sauce and sweet-savory taste made up for it. Lunch time isn't very busy and the staff are friendly. Plus, you get the taiko drumming and greeting shouts.

Dinner (3.5/stars)
I ordered the miso marinated mackerel, avocado croquette and the seafood udon, which added up to around $20. The mackerel was disappointing; way overcooked and chewy (and looked different from the menu picture!). The avocado croquette was a nice surprise - creamy avocado mashed with potato and deep fried in a whole avocado skin. Definetly recommend it! The seafood udon is a generous portion filled with clam, mussel, squid and scallop. I also tried the kimchi pork udon - both are excellent and good a way to fill up. 

I noticed that DonDon has been been having a hard time as its constantly being compared with Guu. This is somewhat unfair - if you visit any izakaya in Tokyo you will find that the layout (communal tables + bar etc.) and the environment (warm welcome shouts and farewells) are the same. The layout and restaurant culture is not unique to Guu. Dondon has captured the friendly and casual environment of the late night izakaya, perhaps in a slightly more trendy environment  The menu still needs some improvement, but I'm certainly enthusiastic to come back again."}
{"text":"The decor seemed promising once I entered, but I can honestly say DonDon Izakaya was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Between 2 people, we ordered about $60-$70 worth of food and drinks. The drinks were filled with mostly ice and maybe 1/3 cup liquid and really not that impressive in taste. We had about 8-10 dishes...and they were all below par for the price to say the least. There were a couple of dishes that we waited FOREVER for. We sat there for 20 minutes with NO ONE coming over to check on us. I had to flag them down to ask them about the remaining dishes that we didn't get, AND they went through the list of the things we ordered and asked which one we didn't receive (really?). Another 10-15 minutes passed by and we still didn't get the food. I was beyond impatient after having such bad food and they kept us waiting for over 30 minutes. So I called them over again to cancel the food and asked for the bill...some other guy (I assumed \"manager\") came over, asked us AGAIN which items we didn't get, did NOT apologize, and gave us the bill. I was so pissed I left without a single penny of tip (and I eat out often and always give at least 15%). Not only the food was disgusting and overpriced, the service was horrible. AVOID this restaurant at all cost."}
{"text":"I was pretty interested in trying this place out after my SO experienced a great time during their opening period. The atmosphere tries to be fun, sort of like Guu on Church, but not with quite the authenticity or enthusiasm.

We went on a weeknight, and were seated immediately at the counter. We ordered 5-6 dishes between the two of us. It was summer time, so I got a Caesar and my SO ordered an Asahi.

It took forever and a day to get any water or flag a server's attention to take our order. Once our order was placed, the food came at good intervals.

My impressions:
1. Japanese pickle set - Very tiny, didn't match the photo, and the pickle-ness was off. Do not recommend.
2. Fwhat fwhat pork buns - High bun to pork ratio, and pork was very measly. A major disappointment. Do not recommend.
3. Tokyo style hot dog - Dry bun, hot dog had zero flavour. Do not recommend.
4. Seafood udon - This was one of the better dishes that we tried. Not sure if the redeeming feature was that it wasn't very off from expectations. It's hard to get udon wrong in my eyes, and it was a good-sized portion. A safe choice.
5. Shrimp mayo - This dish was pretty tasty. We saw a lot of tables ordering it, so thought it should be a good choice, and it was probably the only dish that we said \"this tastes good\". Recommend.

I also don't recommend the caesar (it seemed like water and vodka), but the Asahi was enjoyable.

Overall, my first time at DonDon Izakaya was pretty underwhelming. I'm sorry because I was looking forward to my meal, and really wanted to like it! I wonder if I would like the lunch time menu better, so I'm not fully writing it off my list yet."}
{"text":"I only appreciated the decor.  Some of the food items were overpriced while others seemed underpriced. Everything has meat or cheese, except for the $8 griled vegetables that were plated beautifully but the portion is very small, about six bites and not especially delicious in flavour, nor did I like the burnt pieces. After a $40 bill for two, I left hungry.  I would return to the bar only."}
{"text":"Have been here many times.  I really like the atmosphere.  Love their Don Don Sake! Actually I love their entire selection of sake.  Food wise, I usually order a premium grilled selection, the Charashi Don, and a few DonDon Sake.  Happy Happy Times.  The only reason why I only give them 4 stars is the fact that I have to climb a set of smelly and sticky stairs to get there."}
{"text":"First time enjoying an Izakaya style for a night time snack. We had to climb a few flight of stairs and upon entering someone helped us get seated and they banged on the drum as the workers greeted. We sat right in front of the cooks in their station to see the action, so I thought that was cool.

We started out with their tiger shrimp deep fried with mayo. 6 pcs and it was enjoyable, but definitely would give you a sore throat eating too many of those. Then we got their skewers where you can have 5 different styles. They got pork belly with green onion, beef, chicken, asparagus bacon, king oyster mushroom bacon.

I like to say that the most enjoyable ones were the bacon wrapped stuff and beef. The worst is their pork belly which was really chewy.

We also got their salmon with seaweed in a miso soup style. This to me is just normal, nothing to report about. My gf got the rice with poached egg and pork belly. Again, the pork belly is kind of dry. With just these dishes ordered, BAM $40 +TAX!!! No drinks too. Kind of steep, and I'm not sure if I would enjoy coming back a bit disappointed again. Maybe I'll give Guu a shot since they're top notch Izakaya."}
{"text":"The head cheif is from Japan and you can find some authentic Japanese food here.
Atmosphere was great. 
and they got really wide range selection of authentic Japanese alchohol.

I visited during weekdays around 9pm and there were still a lot of people."}
{"text":"Don't expect to eat a full meal here, but you can order variety of stuff which are amazing. They come in small portions, and since you're sharing order a lot! 

Not a lot of people know the concept of \"izakaya\" but that's how it is. It's a bar with side dishes. 

Love their grilled salmon where you dip in salt and eat with red onions and garlic. 

I know some sakes can be expensive, but you can ask for house size for those. So, basically, if the whole bottle says $200, and you ask for house/small size, they give you in those small sake bottles that'll serve upto 6 shots? and it'll be around $20+ depending on the type."}
{"text":"Very eclectic and noisy, I haven't seen this kind of atmosphere in Toronto for quite some time. The service is slow, but the food is fairly tasty once it arrives, without breaking the bank. It's picnic table style, so you'll be mingling with your neighbours, which is just fine for this setting. I'd say it's a nice place to hang out with your friends for food and drink on Thursday and Friday night."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday with a colleague. The atmosphere was cool, but the food was really sub-par. We ordered a sushi and sashimi platter and both left much to be desired. The fish used in the sushi was clearly not fresh- both mackerel and salmon. The sides that came with it were really lackluster too! The edamame was insanely salted more than I've ever seen. The service was very poor despite the restaurant being fairly empty. Would definitely not recommend"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was certainly not disappointed. The food was reasonably priced and the service was decent. I enjoyed everything that I tasted; they did an especially nice job on the beef tataki. I enjoyed our seating near the grill - it was cool to see the cooks in action.

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to check out DonDon given the buzz and decent reviews that it has been garnering. We arrived early for dinner on Good Friday, I think it was 6pm, restaurant was about half full. By the time we left an hour later, it was full with a line-up.

We were quickly sat by the hostess who wanted us to sit at the bar in front of the open kitchen. I have an aversion to sitting this close to the kitchen, I HATE reeking like food after a meal. It's a neurotic pet peeve of mine. She moved us to a nice table near the bar.

We quickly looked over the menu and ordered drinks. Wanted to order some You's Time sake but they were out. Ordered drinks, I had a nama grapefruit sour, mark had the Nama Lemon Sour (both $5.50). They were okay, but not good enough to order a second.

For food we ordered: Beet Salad ($8.90), Steamed Sabu-Sabu ($7.20), Ginger Fried Chicken ($6.80), Tokyo Style Hot Dogs ($5.20), Smoked BC Tuna Sashimi ($10.50) and Smoked Yellowtail Sashimi ($13.50). The beet salad was pretty standard, goat cheese, beets and mixed greens. Uninspiring. The Steamed Sabu Sabu were essentially pork buns stuffed with pork belly, bean sprouts, oyster and enoki mushrooms and sauce. The buns were super dry (a bit stale) though the pork belly was well cooked. Ginger fried chicken was alright, not nearly as good as Guu's. The Toyko-style hot dogs were also okay, nothing to write home about. The tuna sashimi was our favourite item we ordered, slightly smoked served with a bit of sea salt. The yellowtail version had a funky taste.

Overall, really unimpressed with the food.   

So why is DonDon busy? Is it because people are turned off by the lines at Guu? Probably not seeing that there was a line when we left. Is it because more centrally located? Maybe.  Given the chance, I'd rather wait for an hour at Guu than eat subpar food."}
{"text":"This izakaya was recommended by a friend. For those of you who have never tried, an izakaya is a place that serves Japanese bar food, no sushi here. The dishes are meant to be small and paired with sake (or you can have a dry dinner as well, the food is usually quite good). Boisterous and friendly, Don Don Izakaya has a set of staff that make the eating experience that much more enjoyable.

Teriyaki Tokyo Dog: Not a good start. Dry and over salted. The meatballs could have used more seasoning in them.

Deep Fried Pork Belly: A thinly sliced piece of pork belly that is deep fried and drizzled with their mayonnaise-based sauce. The batter is considerably thicker than the piece of pork belly which unfortunately takes away from the flavour of the protein.

Black Seafood Rice: Interesting combination of sweetened rice with seaweed and seafood. I have to say I've never tried something quite like this, but the slight tang and sweetness from the rice pairs very well with the seaweed.

Jaja beef: Raw slices of beef that you are to sear at your table with a miniature cast-iron pan along with an assortment of vegetables and mushrooms. Tender and juicy, the steak is good especially paired with the BBQ sauce that they make. Would have liked to see more marbling on the meat though.

Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience there.. Went to this restaurant with my friends, only ordered one item but I paid 25 dollars for the my own separate bill. I am pretty sure they calculated the wrong price .."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times but never gotten down to write a review. So here I goooo.

The first thing you like to notice is the decor which is pretty amazing and it gives off a fun vibe, seemingly persuading you that you'll have a great time eating here, which is evidently so. These are the only things in this review I find worth mentioning.

The yakitori's are great; $3 for 2 skewers is a great price when sharing with people. The beef and the asparagus and bacon (with teriyaki sauce) are a hit with my friends and I, and we make sure to always order those first as starters.

The black croquettes are memorable, seeing as it is one of their popular dishes. At first I was a bit iffy to try them, but hey, it's popular for a reason. Same goes for the shrimp mayo (oh my gosh, please try it) and the kimchi udon.

The karaage for me is usually a hit or miss. There were times when it tasted or bland, or too much soy sauce in it (does that make sense?, haha). Other times, it made my night a bit happier. I think the price of $6.80 for this serves it justice.

The staff are so energetic and you don't need to hear them yelling in your ears to know so. Which, I would like to say, I prefer Don Don over Guu (although I'm still a fan). Usually, I go with 4+ friends and a $20 bill is what I'm burning from my wallet. Plus, anywhere that's going to give me more than one scoop of ice cream for 2 bucks is always a win for me.

There are many reviews that don't give Don Don many stars, but I think it's worth a try that won't explode your wallet if your going to be trying it with friends.

I will definitely come again but maybe with just one other to see where the prices take me."}
{"text":"Meh. 

It's no Guu. 

Not like I expected it to be so, but it tries really hard to do it. The attempt to get the staff to cheer when people enter/leave, the similar restaurant layout, etc. But there are a few reasons why they cannot compete: 

- The space is WAY bigger than Guu, so you'll never have the same intimacy of atmosphere 

- The food menu is much more extensive -- too big, in my opinion 

- The staff's heart is just not in it

But moving onto the food itself, we ordered: 

1) Tokyo dog: pork sausage in a hot dog bun topped with kimchi and other pickled veg. It tasted okay, but nothing special. Wish the kim chi was hotter, but being slightly cold it didn't go too well with the sausage. The yellow hot dog bun was clearly from the Toronto hot dog street vendors. 

2) F-what f-what pork: (can someone explain the name choice??) It was pork belly along with ginger, green onion, hoisin sauce on a steamed bun (man tou). This was pretty tasty but the bun was again, pre-made and from those big bags you buy in Chinese grocery stores. 

3) Black sesame-crusted croquettes: this was my favourite, and I loved how odd they looked as 3 black chunks sitting on the plate. The inside was a creamy mix of potato and cod, and had wonderful flavour. Would order a few plates of this next time! 

Overall, it was alright. The service was pretty bad, and we probably had 3-4 different people \"serve\" us because we just had to flag down a new person every time. Ah well. Maybe they just need some more time."}
{"text":"Drink selection is what makes this a 4 star joint!  Food is decent, not great but who is really here for the food anyway?  Great times, great atmosphere, friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great go-to Izayaka. Kind of under the radar, since everyone wants to go to Guu or whatever they are called now. Don Don is a wee bit on the pricey side. But the food comes out quickly. The staff is attentive. And there are a few items that I love there: 

- Skewers are a must. Great to share and pair with sake!
- The black croquettes. So unique.
- Karage. Who doesn't like fried chicken?
- Ja Ja Beef. Its really a fun experience to cook your meet and veggies table side yourself.
- Always check out one of their specials

In general, you're not missing out if you don't order the sushi / raw items. I think Don Don's strength is more in hot \"bar food\" items like their udon, skewers, and specials. Fun place to watch games in a lively atmosphere, and go on a double date with since there is so much going on and the table/bench style seating makes for a nice two-on-two evening."}
{"text":"an izakaya where you dont have people yelling, screaming, or banging drums.
 very reasonably priced place.
 shimesaba (blowtorched vinegared mackerel) is really really good. like, get 3 orders worthy."}
{"text":"This is no Guu, and for my fellow Vancouver transplants, no Hapa either. 

Upon entrance to the restaurant you're in a small enclosed corridor where a host greets you and you're surrounded by bamboo sticks separating you from the restaurant. It was around 7pm on a Thursday night we visited and seemed to be very quiet, figuring we're early and the rush hasn't happened yet. After talking to the host, all tables are taken! This is not the same atmosphere as Guu where upon entrance their yellowing on top of their lungs to welcome you as you step in and the room is filled with noise and excitement. A completely different atmosphere, more quaint and you could actually have a group conversation and hear everyone clearly, except when they beat the large Japanese drums at the door as patrons enter the dining room. 

Hoping the food could compensate for the lack of atmosphere in the room, it really didn't overwhelm that much. We tried their sashimi selection (sweet shrimp, butter fish, yellowtail, smoked hay bc tuna) which were ok but we've had better elsewhere in the city. I will give them points on the sweet shrimp as it was big and really succulent. We tried their grilled skewers (can also be fried) which were ok and personally I can't taste the difference between ones with sauce and one that is salted. The egg salad with bacon is a twist on the deviled egg with added bacon on top. The steamed shabu shabu came in a bamboo steamer layered with bean sprouts with several slices of pork and some sauces for dipping, very healthy but nothing special. We also tried the Japanese egg which is basically hot tamago sushi without the rice. The ginger chicken is fried and done well but didn't taste any ginger nor did we taste any ginger in the tofu marinated in ginger sauce. Overall the food was very underwhelming and price points I found on the higher end of the spectrum for izakaya. I just didn't find any value, the food didn't tantilize my taste buds, or the plating/presentation was anything special. I will give them kudos for their extensive sake selection, as we ourselves enjoyed 3 bottles during our stay. 

On a side note, it's run by the same people as Sushi Time on Queen Street, so not sure if that is a good or bad thing for people. But I did find their interview with TheGridTO a bit comical saying how they first got the idea to open an izakaya in Toronto 10 years ago but Guu beat them to it."}
{"text":"The wait was not bad, considering it was only about 10-15 min on a friday night. And the bonus is that you actually get to wait there, indoors, with seating! Not a fan of the drumming honestly, perhaps it feels like they are trying too hard to be like Guu. In terms of food I have to say it was disappointing. Considering the quality of the food at Kaiseki Sakura, I expected a bit more from Chef Izutsu even with the understanding that this is a different type of food and he is probably not the one doing the cooking. I quite enjoyed the space, and wouldn't mind going back for drinks. For a good meal I would go to Guu. But for those who wants variety, Don Don offers a pretty extensive menu."}
{"text":"So a nice atmosphere accompanied by expensive, forgettable food. 

Went here with my boyfriend again after a brutally hot day. The pitchers of cold Sapporo just hit the spot, but it's not the cheapest beer option in the vicinity ($19). 

The ambience is not at lively as Guu, but that might be better for carrying on a conversation. The decor and communal tables are great, and the extensive selection of sake and cocktails is quite interesting to pick through.

Unfortunately, the food menu is forgettable. Over the course of many visits (we work nearby), we tried several items: the Tokyo hotdog, beef tataki, black croquettes, deep-fried pork belly, torched mackerel, fried squid, and green tea dessert. There was nothing that was inedible, but nothing spectacular either. Furthermore, the menu isn't the cheapest in this area...my tip is if you feel like Japanese split ramen at Sansotei or Santouka, or curry at Gyugyuya. Come here for the drinks if you want sake, but if you want beer head north or east and spend less money.

Service is usually very kind and friendly, but can be slow."}
{"text":"passed by this restaurant during lunch time and was attracted by the multimedia and various media reviews at storefront. Decided to try it out. Man! don't ever let media reviews blind your eyes. There were only serving 5 tables and it took them more than 20mins to bring out our lunch. We ordered the butter soy ramen set, grill fish set of the day and a deep fried octopus starter. The deep fried dumpling in the ramen set was absolutely cold, taste like left overs. what it shocked us was we saw the chef inside brought out a box of octopus and smelled into the box. He then made a really unpleasant facial expression seems like the octopus has gone bad. Just when we thought he's going to throw out the food, he turns around and started washing them and put back into the box. OMG! I am so damn disgusted. Guys don't ever let what you see from the outside fooled you. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"wouldn't recommend if you're looking for quite place to eat.
If you like Guu, you'll love DonDon.
they have a big drum they play every time someone comes in.
food is reasonably priced for izakaya, they take reservations!!
So many selection on drinks! many different kinds of sake.
overall, very fun place to go!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend after Christmas for lunch. We were both excited to try something new and... were extremely disappointed. My friend ordered the only meal with vegetables on the menu, and these were... potatoes. Hardly a vegetable. ;) He still ate it.
I asked the waiter for his recommendation. I wanted noodle soup with chicken, and he suggested the house's most famous dish. It was nothing short of repulsive. The pasta were thick and sloppy, the broth starchy, oily and tasteless, the chicken mostly skin fat. Yuck. I had five bites and left the rest untouched. Never has this happened before. NEVER. EVER.
The waiter noticed, asked if I wanted to take it to go. I said \"no thanks,\" but he never asked if anything was wrong with the soup. Yikes!
Service and decor were okay, thus the two stars. But needless to say, I'm not going back and suggest strongly: stay away!"}
{"text":"Such a shockingly bad experience last night. My sister is in from out of town, and she loves to try new experiences. Where she is from they barely have sushi so I thought Don Don would be great fun.

We arrived, waited a couple minutes for a table and were seated along the bar in front of the cooks. About 15 minutes goes by and I flag a server. We order beverages.  10 min, no drinks arrive so I ask our server to check on them. 10 more minutes, I ask a different server to check on the bar. I turn and look, the bartender looks fine, no chits pouring in. Hmm. I ask a THIRD person and a girl comes over with a beer and a pop. We have been waiting about 35 minutes. 10 more minutes goes by, and my sister's blood sugar is plummeting. Being in front of the cooks, I can see that our order is not being made. Long story short, I ask for our meal another 3 times, from 3 different people and then ask to speak to the manager. They check and our order was never entered. The people sitting beside us, with the same server have come in, eaten and left during this time. Our completely clueless server never noticed.

At that point I ask the kitchen to please just get us some deep fried chicken (cooks fast) as its 11pm and my sister has yet to have dinner. The manager obliges, and comps our beer, pop and fried chicken order. Thats nice for them for sure but the service was ridiculous. If we had not paid for parking I would have left 45 min earlier. 

I should mention that the manger was very helpful when I finally got to him, and the hostess was really sweet and hustling. She was running food, seating people it was insane. 

Kicker in the end, the chicken was not nearly as good as Guus. 

Won't ever return."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food I've ever had at any restaurant, ever and that says a lot.  I recommend this place for cheap drinks/beer and that is the only reason I give it a 2 star and not a 1 star rating.  I had the salmon and eel sushi - both were horrible .  The chicken cartilage was inedible and I had to spit it out.  I am not a picky eater and do go to many different ethnic restaurants and I enjoy sushi etc. but there was literally nothing I had that was good except the edamame."}
{"text":"If you're a man and you eat like a real man, don't go here.

If your girl wants you to take her to a nice Japanese place, go to Guu's."}
{"text":"came here after a raptor game, it's a quiet night and environment is ok friendly. We ordered sashimi platter, skewers, ramen, torched sushi, takoyaki pizza and crokqette. Overall, 3/5, mandatory 15% tip included in the final bill for two ppl."}
{"text":"i visited dondon about 6times already. it opened recently so every time i visit, they add new items on the menu so i always get something different. they have a large selection on sake. personally i think the atmosphere and overall feeling is better than guu especially because dondon is way bigger. the food is delicious and it come out fast. but i think they should hire more hall staff bc the food gets cooked faster but it takes time for it to be delivered  at your table. once i orderes a bottle
of wine and it about 20 minutes. no explanation if the wine and we had to poir our own glasses.
i've been to many izakaya but i find dondon the best"}
{"text":"Love love love the croquettes at dondon. Great for lunchtime and also for dinnertime izakaya!"}
{"text":"My experience here was a definite highlight and I preferred to food, atmosphere and service to Guu. Some of the favourites at our table: the raw beef tartare dish, the seafood noodles, the pork ramen, the hay smoked sashimi (so good!), the fish in butter and the steamed squid. Loved the food!"}
{"text":"A friend and I failed to nab a table at Santouka so we headed over to Don Don. I didn't mind as a friend of mine in the resto biz said it's really good and I had wanted to try it for a while, just never got around to it. 

Upon climbing all the stairs to finally arrive, we stood around while the staff chitted and chatted in front of us until someone was ready to indicate they were aware of our presence. The hostess/server seemed really confused which in turn made us confused until we were finally seated along the open kitchen \"bar\" if you will. There were a lot of Japanese patrons so I figured it must be alright (ie, really alright), but in fact it ended up being just OK (ie, just alright). The atmosphere seemed like an overly subdued version of the izakayas in Japan but the decor seemed right.

We ordered a bunch of things, most of which I coudn't relay back without the menu in front of me..I do remember having the fwhat fwhat (the what??) burger thingies - pork belly on a steamed bun, hardly original and definitely not worth $8 for two; deep fried mackerel - not sure why we got this but it was dry from being deep fried and mackerel should always have its juices intact - our bad, what were we thinking? I was really looking forward to the black croquettes that everyone raves about but they were just weird and not very dense with potato, just runny and bland. They kind of reminded me of Elmer's glue - minus the smell - rolled up and coated in ground black sesame. We also got a few items from their monthly menu which were nothing special, and an assortment of other fish/seafood and pork belly-oriented items. We were feeling porky that night, what can I say...all in all there was nothing spectacular or memorable about any of the dishes and the hostess/server (the confused one) kept trying to snatch away our plates even when there was still half a serving left on them, and it's not like either of us are slow eaters! What's up with that? I guess when you're dealing with such small servings that are gone in two bites, half a serving could look resemble an empty dish.

I had hoped Don Don would be as good as my friend said but it's not."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance with great service. I went here at lunch time and ordered sashimi. Not many people at 3pm. The yellowtail and scallop sashimi were great. However, the salmon roe may not fresh enough or they may cook a little bit after taking out of the fridge. 

Looking forward to trying their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night, lots of people, need to wait. The dishes are a little bit expensive, since each dishes came with small amount. I think maybe it is a good place to drink something, but not good for people who want to eat something."}
{"text":"Riding on Toronto's izakaya craze, DonDon doesn't do very much to separate itself from the pack. Yeah, I get that it's not 'fair' that DonDon is being compared to nearby Guu, but it's unavoidable. The design of the restaurant is similar and many things on the menu were the same. Guu, however, manages to keep things interesting with their daily specials. It was also difficult to get some recommendations from the servers who were clearly Japanese ESL students on a work visa. However, they were nice about it and went to ask the manager to help out with my questions.

We ordered skewers marinated in teriyaki sauce, which were just average. I was not a fan of the amount of things wrapped in bacon (I shock myself even typing this), but the flavor of the bacon was not complimentary to the green onions and mushroom combo. We also ordered the black ink croquettes, but it was hard to tell what was even in it given the amount of cream and mayonnaise. Half of the menu was deep-fried and drenched in the sickly sweet Japanese mayo. Not a fan of everything being deep-fried, especially when it all tastes similar. However, I loved the creme de cassis and oolong tea cocktail I ordered - it was bittersweet and the fruity flavor went well with the smoky taste of the oolong. The mackerel was also a treat, since the server brought it out and seared it in front of us with a torch.

Things DonDon beats Guu at: decor, ambience (you can actually talk), and cocktails. Things DonDon needs to work on: portion size, creativity and variety in the menu, pricing, and amount of mayo in everything."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and we had a variety of different dishes, including the 5 sashimi platter, grilled skewers, black croquettes, pickled fish and veggies, hoppeta yaki, and green tea mousse with red bean for dessert.  We had a three-sake sampler combo, as well as a small bottle of gekkeikan hot sake to go with our meal.

To be honest, everything was fine, but we weren't exactly blown away by anything either. 5 sashimi platter was very fresh, but can find similar (or better) quality at other sushi places; grilled skewers were pretty good too, esp. the pork, chicken, and oyster mushroom, but the beef was too dry; and the pickled fish was flavorful, but the salmon seemed overdone. We also ordered the smokey hay salmon, but it never came because the chef at the grilling station decided to lump our order with other orders and do it further down their \"queue\". Perhaps it's reasonable for them to do that given the smokey hay salmon is done over an open flame, with drumbeats and a whole demonstration, but that didn't help our craving for it!  In the end, we just canceled our order.  Disappointing. 

In terms of ambience, it was a fun and entertaining environment.  A bit rustic with the old wooden tables, and an open kitchen right in front of the bar area, where we sat. Comfortable. 

Question I'm struggling with is: is it worth a second try?"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette. Imagine dinner with 10 women in pink paper crowns. This was that. What was great was that we could easily get a reservation, come early and all sit at one big, long, sunken in table. The vibe was right. 

The food was hit and miss. Chicken tacos came out with cold, mayo covered chicken salad in Old El Paso-like taco shells. But the torched salmon sushi was succulent and piping hot ginger chicken made up for the former. I'd return to try some grilled yellowtail collar and chirashi next time. 

If you're out and about near the downtown core, this could be a tasty spot for you. Unfortunately for me, I feel a bit spoiled by the offerings at Kinka/Guu."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Deep fried everything and not even in a tasty way. The decor has a woodsy, loud, proud feel. Communal seating elbow to elbow with strangers. Guu is better if you're going to be that densely packed into a resto with greasy food. Good for rowdy groups."}
{"text":"Very convenient location near the greyhound station and also close to downtown. Liked the lively atmosphere inside but the food is so so."}
{"text":"It feels like this place is under new management. The service is slower and the menu items have changed - specifically I'm sad to see the tuna don missing from the menu, it was one of the reasons I come to DonDon.

Not sure if the chefs had changed, but skewers during my last few visits were dry and slightly overcooked, not to mention it also lacks in flavor. 

The thousand island shrimp is delicious of you like tons of batter. Chicken karage was very tender but overly salted... Ask for a large glass of water to go with that dish. 

Service could have been more attentive. Our server kept giving our dishes to the table next to us who arrived later. We ended up waiting for so long we decided to just cancel the order. 

DonDon no longer has that warm homely ambiance I felt when I first came here two years ago, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I would come here over and over again. If only I lived in the downtown core, I'd come here everyday. The only con I'd say is, it's a tad too dark and not enough seating. The food and service is excellent. I love the rustic decor. The moment the guest arrives, they play the drums and yell out something really loud in Japanese. Sounds welcoming and pretty cool."}
{"text":"1 star, because there was gross hair in my food.

I visited here several times ever since they were newly opened.. But they are not as good as first time.

I desided to try their lunch at lunch time but the atmosphere was different with dinner time ..it was very quiet.

Anyways they had nice lunch menu option and beer special as well. 

I ordered beef tatake as an A.P and chirashi don as a meal.

I waited more than 10min for my appetizer
And another more than 15min for my meal.

It is pretty slow .. considering there was only 1 another table.

Anyways beef tatake was okay.. but there was long hair in my beef tatake that I noticed half way though eating it.
And it was not only 1..it kept coming out another hair:(

I felt so disgusting..
I dont understand how come this happened.
The server said it might not hair they will figure it out.

Anyways It was worst experience in my eating out life ever!!

And chirash don was okay. Not great.

Anyways they need to take care of food safety!!"}
{"text":"Ever since my initial visit to DonDon, I've been back a couple of times for lunch and each time have become less and less impressed.

The sushi in the bento has tasted less than fresh the past two times I went for lunch, and the service has been slow and they always mix up at least one thing about our order, whether it be bringing the wrong item, or forgetting one person's lunch.

So with food and service sucking, and prices always having been a bit on the high side, I can't see much reason to go back again!"}
{"text":"Had the bou sushi lunch set, $13.50, which was a set of 9 seared sushi pieces accompanied by a side miso soup, salad, seaweed salad, and two ramekins of pickled burdock roots.

A very thin slice of fish sits on top of a disproportionately large mound of rice, which was both dried out and gluey (once mashed to form the sushi shape). Fish tastes \"fishy\" / not fresh - worsened by the odor of the bathroom entrance next to our table which evidently needed some cleaning. 

Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Over priced food and drinks !!

It's full of 19-21 drunk students inside. Been there 4 times and it's always packed with drunk teenagers.

Their portions are terribly small for the price. You need to order 3-4 appetizers and entrees to feel full ( per person)

Their drinks go up to $100. Ordered to two drinks and our table's bill was over $200!"}
{"text":"This is the first izakaya I've ever been to, however I am a Japanese food junkie. The food here is delicious, fresh and well presented. The atmosphere is lively and warm. I'll be bringing friends and family here for as long as it will be in the hood."}
{"text":"Don Don Izakaya is the worst service experience I have ever had in this city. Hands down the worst - went for my birthday in September with friends, were there for 2 hours with only an initial and 1 follow up server visit, despite trying to flag people down and telling bus boys we wanted to order, waitress left on the follow-up visit without taking the whole table's drink/food order (?!?!) and when we finally flagged her down for our bill, she brought it by and said \"oh you don't have to tip\" to which one of our party replied \"don't worry, we weren't going to.\""}
{"text":"My sister decided that she wanted to try this place after seeing reviews online. We went last Wednesday just after 5pm. I ordered us a pitcher of Sapporo which was on special, but we ended up with two pints instead.

We ordered the fwhat-fwhat pork, the okra kimchi fried rice, the ginger fried chicken, and sea foie gras. I really liked the flavour of the pork belly, but there was not much of it. It was mostly just steamed bun. The rice and the chicken were my favourite dishes and I didn't try the foie gras which consisted of three surprisingly small pieces.

It's basically Japanese tapas so you get a few different plates and share everything. I like tapas style places because you get to try more things at one time. It can get a bit pricey, but it was a fine experience. I'm glad we tried this restaurant, but I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I came here about 2-3 times already. Everything I've ever had here...has been super mediocre. I think the most recent dishes I had was the beef tataki and smoky hay sashimi(salmon), both really popular dishes. Though I liked the taste of the tataki, it wasn't anything special. The Smokey hay sashimi looked like it would be really good but was pretty disappointing. It just tasted like smoked thick cut salmon, and I don't even think the salmon quality was that great either. I heard the cocktails were pretty good but I didn't like the oolong hi I ordered, nor was any of my friends' cocktails anything spectacular either. Service is friendly, but hard to get a hold of during their peak times. I do like the atmosphere here and will probably be back to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is bad. 

There was no server assisting customer to places and it's very hard to get server's attention. 

Food is decent. We ordered tofu appetizer. It's very smooth! I like my sashimi rice and my frd's seafood ramen as well! The steamed shabu shabu is more special the way it looks than its taste

The cocktail is too light, I ordered a peach one, it's just like soda."}
{"text":"Our little foodie group decided to meet up over our favourite dish...takowasa!! We all love this dish!! We decided to meet at Don Don Izakaya and I've actually never been there but heard they have tasty izakaya foods. It was super busy on a Sunday, but thank goodness our friend made reservations. I liked that the servers and everyone that worked there greeted you with IRASSHAIMASU!! when you arrive, I think most izakayas do that, except a few. But I really like it cause it makes you feel very welcomed. They also had a drum that they strike whenever a certain dish was being prepared. I thought that was cool! You get an intimate yet fun vibe in here. We also go the table with the best lighting, as the restaurant is kinda dark. So perfect for us. We ordered a bunch of dishes (I will post a video later) and it barely fit on our table . But of course, we ordered what we originally came here for. But x6 LOL  and this is how it looks like when you order six orders; a lot of takowasa in a one big ass bowl! The rest of the foods all came out very very fast, I was impressed. This takowasa dish was so good and so pretty!! Look at the flower petals right?! I really loved that it was the raw type, I really don't like the cooked ones. Although I would like it to be more wasabi flavour, (I LOVE wasabi that's why) but next time I'll order more wasabi to mix it in . One surprising dish that I really love was the black potato croquette! It did not look very appetizing because it was literally black! But the flavours omgggggg. It was phenomenal! The potato inside was soft, but the outside was perfectly fried, so it was crunchy. Never ever judge this dish....seriously.  It was my first time here, but definitely will return!! Especially for the takowasa and black potato croquettes"}
{"text":"irasshaimase!

this is one place where as soon as I took a look at the menu, I knew I should have looked up some reviews beforehand. so many little goodies, so hard to decide! but perhaps...it was a good thing that I didn't get deterred by the low ratings on here. the atmosphere is fantastic; I can't compare to Guu as I've never been, but they greet each group with a loud irasshaimase! and a boom on the Taiko drum when you get in. wasn't too loud to hold conversations - that is, until they crank up the grill and get the Taiko beating again. yes to the fire, yes to the drums! why don't we all celebrate grilled food this way? *note to self and this summer's barbeques*

as any legit izakaya, alcohol definitely dominated the menu. super saketastic! the hay-flame grilled BUTTERFISH was indeed buttery and smoky; the GINGER-FRIED CHICKEN was perfectly fried and served piping hot with what seemed like two types of aioli (though I couldn't differentiate the two).

I do agree with other Yelpers in that service was seriously lacking. we were very quick to get two seats on a Sunday evening but it took a while for the server to come back around to take our orders. even longer thereafter to accept our payment once the bill was already issued. seeing that the servers carry ipads ready for both taking orders and money, it seemed like an excessive wait (-0.5 stars).

but this is not a deal breaker. as I look at the website's menu to recall the items i ordered, i'm getting hungry all over again...i'll be back!"}
{"text":"personally speaking, I like DonDon over Guu. DonDon has better food, and much more choices of japanese alcohol (including their signiture cocktails).
Service is good (better than Guu), they cares about how much you enjoy your meal (Guu seemes like assuming you like them, or think you should like them). 
Although the food is not what I had best (in terms of izakaya food, Ju is obviously the best), it is fairly good enough for complementing sake, and they have very good desserts."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday and all 16 of us went home hungry because the food was just not appetizing to go for second round.

Give it more selections and please don't serve lukewarm skewers. 

By the way, the service was great!

+1 star for food +2 stars for service but -1 star for the annoying drum"}
{"text":"I love me an izakaya! But after visiting this one I will have to rephrase - I love me a GOOD izakaya.  Came in with the large party.  For a place this size you would think that would not be an issue.  Here are the problems we faced:wrong orders served, some orders not served at all, long wait time for service, and they would not split the bill more than 5 ways.  I will give their staff credit for kindness, humour, rushing to fix issues, and apologizing for their mistakes.

The food is mediocre.  I prefer the quality and taste of most of their izakaya competitors.  The only thing I could see that sets them apart is the polar bear beer - Sapporo is served with frozen foam that keeps your beer ice cold longer and comes in 4 different sizes. Go large or go home.

I don don think I will be returning to this izakaya."}
{"text":"So close to the downtown core and loads of fun - place is packed in the evenings even when I went on a Tuesday. You can't beat the great feeling of an izakaya, loud yelling and cold drinks and awesome service. Ordered one too many sake bombs and way too many pitchers. The chicken karaage (think they called it ginger chicken) was way on point. 

Come here after work with the coworkers and order some sake flights and beers."}
{"text":"Was here for a friends birthday. The first Japanese non-sushi restaurant that I have been too. Over all I really liked the food, but it was not cheap. Given the area, that is to be expected. I had a bit of everything here as we ordered in a large group. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Have dined in and ordered delivery from Don Don Izakaya.

The restaurant itself itself is great for groups. Long tables and open space. I forget the name of what I ordered, but received varieties of salmon on rice and remember the generous portion!

Delivery isn't bad. Fair prices and there's no delivery fee on JustEat, although the minimum's $15. The chirashi  is a \"deal\" for under $10-- there's a variety of raw fish in there which were fresh. They seemed like leftover pieces because they were cubed chunks and not slabs of sashimi. The shrimp mayo sounded great and I wanted to try it because ebi mayo is one of my favourite dishes. But for $9.50...I really was expecting more shrimp or larger shrimp. It tasted good, but it's fried shrimp and mayo. Should've ordered sashimi or nigiri instead."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch and really loved the lunch bento selections! I wish I could have picked all of them but ended up with the chirashi lunch selection for $13.50 

I really loved the side dishes but would probably not pick the chirashi bowl again because it just felt like I was eating just deconstructed sushi nigiri... 

I'm not sure about dinner at DonDon since I'm sure it would be busy like Guu but I would definately recommend lunch! Fair price and tasty!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow and alright service. 

Would recommend other Izakaya."}
{"text":"Food was bad, like literally BAD.... my yakisoba was salty AF. The sashimi was mushy which almost made my puke. Servers were polite but the service was terrible. I was sitting right at the bar next to where them servers would deliver the food from and yet no one bothered to top off my empty water cup until I asked. Things were way overpriced"}
{"text":"- food wise, hands down, get the negima (pork belly and green onion skewers)... AND DO NOT GET TERIYAKI. Get the salt one. teriyaki is for noobs.
- the banging of the taiko (don don is the sound of a drum...) when anyone walks in gets old fast. 
- guu isnt the end all be all of izakaya, but if i compare don don to izakaya's in japan, this place is decent.
- ill be back. need to get my drink on to really guage this spot."}
{"text":"Good izakaya close to Eaton Centre! I've been here a few times and have had consistent experiences with food and service. It's a pretty lively restaurant with staff shouting and drums banging. Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun atmosphere. There are quite a few food options to choose from on the menu and they advertise their polar beer (with frozen beer froth on top).

Polar beer - fun way to drink beer but other than that nothing too special.

Fried ginger chicken - portion was larger than expected, comes with two dips (mayo and spicy mayo). Recommended for sharing.

Clams - a small bowl of clams without shells, marinated in a sweet soy sauce. Would order this again.

Deep fried oysters - 5 pieces served with tartar sauce. Delicious!

Rayu udon - plain udon with a spicy sauce for mixing into the noodles. Good value.

Aburi salmon sushi - 8 pieces, blowtorched. Obviously not as good as the ones served at specialty sushi restaurants but still tasted okay."}
{"text":"Sort of like a quieter, slightly less happy Guu. The food is middling to decent but the pricing is a bit lower too. I work near DonDon so I do head over sometimes after work for a kirin and takowasa. For a while the price between the menu and what I was getting on my bill was different which was kind of weird and annoying. Overall, a bit of a wash - but sometimes good enough is good enough."}
{"text":"In terms of seating and receiving our items, the service was impeccable and always accommodating. Waitors and waitresses were friendly. Atmosphere is fairly dim but they have a nice big screen TV at the bar"}
{"text":"Food and sake was great! the ice cream was icy tho, I am like eating an ice cream with crystal ice in it..."}
{"text":"This is the typical izakaya experience, with perhaps less wait time than Guu and just as pleasing menu items. I can only vouch for evenings, as I think any izakaya that does open for lunch tends to have less-than-exciting choices (I have a colleague who tried to order cheese wontons at an izakaya at lunch and was direly disappointed)."}
{"text":"worst experience ever. we arrived around 12:30 there were a lot of empty seats but thr waiteress ignored the waiting line ...and she even let the ppl came later sat first....terrible service.... never go there...food is just soso"}
{"text":"I've never been to Guu so I can't compare.  I really liked this place for a few reasons.

I went here with some friends at around 10:30pm on a friday.  It wasn't empty but there were no lines and we got a table very quickly.

I loved the decor.  The samurai sword handles on their draught beers, the rice paddy bins lining their walls, the long communal tables, the bamboo and the big drum coupled with the gear worn by the sushi chef all added to a unique charm about the place.

We were here for the saki, and it didn't disappoint.  Granted, at the LCBO the prices are half that at Don Don, the atmosphere was great for just having some appetizers and drinks with friends.  

The food was good though we had mostly appetizers.  The skewers were very good and the black croquettes had looked like carpet (to me) but tasted like clouds with a hint of crunchiness!

The menu was pretty good.  I usually can't visualize food when reading the menu, so the pictures really helped out.

I have to comment on the staff and clientele.  The staff were great to us.  From seating to taking our orders, I thought they handled things well.  And boy did they get in on the fun.  They had a couple of times where they all cheered and took a shot or swig of beer with everyone.  It felt like the oriental version of Cheers...where everyone knows your name....

The clientele can be interesting too.  Having that drum there brings out all sorts of characters.  While it was entertaining seeing people bang on the drum, if it had continued it would have been annoying.   However, there were some good drummers so in this instance it was more entertaining.

My only complaint and one I do see in the reviews is that the food took time to come out.  For appetizers it seemed unusually long, though I'd like to think they were plucking the asparagus from their rooftop garden and slaughtered a pig on the spot to make that bacon, before putting on the salt they mined from an underground salt cave....all resulting in the bacon wrapped salted asparagus we got.  But maybe they are just slow.

I erred on the side of the popular consensus and took a star away for the slow service."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times before because its close to school but this is my first time posting a review. I love the food from here but this place can be pricey so good for special occasions. Their lunch menu is one page long but their dinner menu is more extensive. I've been to both lunch and dinner but I prefer dinner because of the wider selection. This place is a Izakaya place so you can expect to share tables with people you don't know and it can get loud. For today's lunch I ordered the grilled fish of the day which was mackerel. The food was well presented and it came with several side dishes as seen in the pic. My friends ordered grilled chicken set, katsu don set, and some chicken nabeya? (tasted like fried chicken). They were all yummy, especially the fried chicken which came with a tartar like sauce. I always like to come back but I can't always afford to!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to an Izakaya before and was keen on the experience. Up a flight up stairs, through some curtains and BOOM goes the Taiko drum to welcome us. All of the staff was very friendly though at first they seated us next to grill right at the end of the bar where it was quite warm.

I ordered the plum wine as it was on special, It was amazing, Not too sweet and not too bitter and packed a punch at 20%ABV. My lady had the lemony citrus thing, which was also quite nice,

We tried the Steam Shabu Shabu, the pork belly, which was quite nice and had a very different texture. We also had the Hoppeata Yaka, which was chicken and potato and a nice sauce, however the chicken was a bit stringy, maybe next time we will try to get the vegetarian version.

We also had the deep fried skewers, which were also really nice and fried goodness. We also had the deep fried shrimp, mm mm, everything was good and alot of food."}
{"text":"I like don don. It's always a very nice experience. As you walk in your instantly welcomed by the sound of a drum. It makes you feel like a VIP. They always have specials for both food and drinks. It is small so it can get cozy.. One thing I really lien is the open kitchen where you can see your food being made, makes it like your having dins and a show! Pricing is very fair..I Always leave feeling full and it doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I love this place! I remember me of japan. The entire ambiance is very japanease. The food is excellent and very authentic. They also have a lot of good combinations that i never see before.

Don't forget to tell them its your bday you wint regret it!"}
{"text":"I remember going here sometime as it opened and had lunch here with my siblings and it was pretty bad. The katsu sauce on my katsudon was so overpowering all I tasted was sauce death. The karaage was dry lmao.

Revisiting again in the future now old enough to drink the  food was okay, nothing special other than the fact that they have a very vey large food menu. They had monkfish liver sashimi which was really cool and the salty tofu pudding was a very intersting try as i havent had either before. The private sitting rooms are cool too. i don't know this place isn't as hype as it seems. Experiencing this type of izakaya for the first time is okay but its not something Id wanna return again for unless maybe really big parties (more than 10 ppl) but I'm sure when the time comes I'll find a better place to go to."}
{"text":"Nothing special. A regular normal Japanese restaurant, but the environment is not bad though. Good for hanging out with friends at Friday."}
{"text":"Came here at midnight and it was quite packed. Flavour isn't really there compared to other izakaya I've been to. I ordered the torched salmon sushi and deep fried jumbo shrimp but it came out really dry with few flavour. Other than that service was quick, efficient and very friendly! There were many staff and all willing to help you with whatever you need. 

*bonus, opens really late"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch. First time I got the Gyu don and Tako wasabi. Both were really good, but I prefer a really strong Tako wasabi, and the last time I had a really good and strong Tako wasabi was at Guu (now Kinka). The Gyu don comes with appetizers, miso soup, and salad. Not a bad deal for lunch.

Second time I got the tonkatsu curry set and the Salmon Bou sushi. The tonkatsu curry was really good and, like the gyu don, a pretty good deal. The salmon bou sushi, however, was a bit forgettable.

Quality: 8/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)."}

It's literally 2 minutes away from Eatons.  You might miss it because the restaurant is on the second floor so make sure you watch out for it!

Service
I can see why people will get angry at the servers, because like WTF where are you?  Lol.  When we first stepped in, we were greeted by a super friendly host and then later led in with their \"welcoming\" drum beats (which to me was cool).  Since the restaurant opens at 5pm, we were definitely the first ones there.  I was surprised that our server didn't come to check on us frequently.  It is actually a bad sign when we have to find him for water refills.  Come to think of it, the experience was horrible because there were only 4 tables present lol. Since we sat at the bar, food will be delivered to us right from the chefs.  This is a pet peeve of mine but if you are working in a service area like restaurants, it wouldn't cost you a limb to smile.  The guy who passed down the food to us would just hand it over and say the name.  I have been to enough Izakayas to tell you that it is the waiter's job to get that plate.  I'm sitting down dude, you want me to stand up and grab that sizzling hot plate of yours with my bare hands?  Big points down.

Food
We must have ordered the right stuff because other than the skewers being more salty, everything else wasn't bad.  The prices are lower than Guu but yes for you critics, Guu is still better.  I want to add that the beer is EXPENSIVE.  Gosh, is that why you never refill my water?

6 skewers combo - someone online said this was recommended - not lol. This was the only dish I didn't like. Please pass and go to Zakkushi instead.  For its price, you are paying for average meat with extra salt lol.The good thing?  The pork wasn't bad.

Ginger fried chicken is worth it.  It will fill your tummy and the sauce in the bottom right corner is A MUST TRY.

Shrimp mayo is a yum yum.  The outside is crispy and you get a lightly seasoned shrimp on the inside (at least I thought it tasted more than plain cooked shrimp).  Quite unique in my perspective.

Pork kimchi udon.  Probably the best dish or at least I enjoyed it the most.  The udon is quite soft and I love how smooth it is.  Did I mention that this one is probably a bit spicy?  Not a lot of meat but I just wanted the udon to be honest.

The food really wasn't bad and I don't hate this restaurant (though I would come back on their \"speicals\" days).  But the greatest shocker was the lack of service.  NEVER make your guests handle the plates, that's just not right.  In addition, why do I always need to find my server?  Sorry that's a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"3rd time here but it would be the last time.  Walked in at 11:25pm and was welcomed in by the manager/owner saying that we're the \"last one\" for the night.  Perfect! - or so I thought.

Was sat down right by the kitchen bar/area and was rushed by the server to order as it was last call for the kitchen.  We understood and we knew what we wanted and ordered the Karage, Tako Wasabi, Tonkotsu Ramen and a Sake Sampler.

The Karage came in an instant - as we were just finished ordering.  It did look like it was cooked but I could see the oil still soaked in the batter already drenching the parchment paper underneath.  3/5 

Tako Wasabi was surprisingly good 4/5 and a good portion size.

Tonkotsu Ramen 1/5 - Salty. Salty. Salty.  The pork that came with it was all fat and the soup itself was luke warm, nearing cold.

Sake Sampler was alright.  Can't really go wrong with Sake.

But then everything went wrong as soon at we approach closing time.  

11:45PM we were given the bill, without us noticing at the side of the table.  Server came by a few minutes later asking have we paid yet - pointing to the bill.  I said no, we didn't even see it.  But I understood they want to settle since it's closing.  Paid the bill and continued eating.  I just received my Sake Sampler and another server came by started to clean the bar area right next to me - while spraying cleaning solutions all over the table and I can see the spray clouds droplets go into my Sake.  Before I could say anything, another server came by and told us \"we're closing now\"  I nodded and said yes we'll finish up soon.

I look around and see that there are 30 people party in the back still drinking and eating, and a few more tables still eating and drinking.  I turn back to my food, but then another server came by to tell us we're closing.  Do they not communicate with each other?

Needless to say 2 more other servers came by even before the clock hits 12:00AM.  And I was fed up.  I got up and went to the manager who sat us down and told him everything.  He barely listened to what I had to say, rushed a few \"sorries\" and continued counting his money.

Don't come here late at night.  Or just don't come here at all."}
{"text":"We came here directly after Kinka because Kinka had reservations and didn't have the space for us for more than an hour. We were greeted by a hostess who lazily banged the taiko drum and we were greeted to a quiet \"irasshaimase\" which seemed weak compared to the liveliness of Kinka. We were honestly pretty disappointed with the experience. Our edamame and cocktails took about 20 minutes to come, and when we'd waited 40 minutes for shabu shabu, we asked a waitress who checked and told us the other waitress had never put our order in. Drinks were pretty good and I like the playlist though. I wouldn't come here again. It seemed as though the waitstaff didn't care."}
{"text":"I don't know why DonDon Izakaya doesn't have 5 stars because this place is AWESOME!!! I first came here when a friend brought me, but now I bring all my friends here. This place has cheap drinks, great ambience, and delicious food.

If you are bringing a group, I highly recommend recommendations. The first time I came here, people were waiting outside for 20 minutes to get a table. DonDon's main competitor is probably Kinka Izakaya and being a fan of that izakaya, I expected to walk in with loud voices welcoming me. However, DonDon doesn't do this, and occasionally yells greetings. They do have drums that they bang every ten minutes or so. 

They have a wide variety of Sake that you can order by the cup or bottle. If your coming with a group you should just order a whole bottle because I find them to be pretty cheap. They have a Sake that is plum and lychee flavoured which I can probably drink as if it was water. I like ordering their cocktails, each is around $7.5 and they are a good portion size. Unlike other bars, they're not watered down with ice! They have cool flavours and you might just spend ten minutes trying to look for the right one. 

The second time I came here I ordered their food such as karage, okonomiyaki, and other popular Japanese izakaya dishes. 10/10 recommend the karage because the chicken was perfectly moist and weren't salty. 

The service is great because the waitresses always have a smile on their face and recommend the best drinks. I did have difficulty communicating with them because it seems that most of them can't speak English.

I recommend to come here with a group of friends if you want to have cheap drinks and eat good food. I will definitely try coming here at Lunch and try out their other offerings."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious Japanese food. The sakes are awesome, and every time they have good recommendations. Also the service is really nice."}
{"text":"Just 'okay'. They greet you with a drum roll when you come in, which is cute. We had bar seats, so we had a lovely view of the very muscular young, male cook ;) highly recommend the bar seats, you get to see what other people are getting! We got their:

Shrimp Mayo - this was just okay, I prefer Kinka or Nome's ebi-mayo to be superior to this. Shrimp just weren't sweet enough/big enough, and just wasn't as 'fluffy'. (11$)
Deep Fried Oysters - I don't know what was up with their deep fryer or the oil, but this was super dark and quite hot! My boyfriend burned the top of his mouth. This was also just 'okay'. (9$)
Squid and Mountain Vegetable Salad - this was quite good, it had a very refreshing salty/sweet/tangy taste. I enjoyed this very much. (4.50$)
Today's Chirashi - this looked very unappetizing, but tastes fine. Serving size was small and the fish didn't look too fresh though. (10$)
Steamed Shabu Shabu - this was really yummy! But only 4 slices of chashu, which was a bit lacking. This came with lettuce, zucchini, and mushrooms along with chashu and it was all steamed in a dimsum-esque container, and they gave you sesame and ponzu sauce to have with it. The sesame sauce was excellent, and the ponzu had a tangy sour taste from the yuzu. This was good - but expensive for the amount of meat. (10$)
23oz Asahi - tasted great, cost about 14$ which is how much it would cost to buy a 6pack of Asahi at LCBO.

Overall - falls on the low scale for izakayas, but it was a pleasant meal after hitting the gym. I probably wouldn't go again - I'd go for Nome/Kintaro/OG Kinka, depending on where you are."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice cozy gathering with close friends after a long day at work, or for the weekend! Good authentic food and atmosphere! Lively environment without being overwhelmingly loud. Love their smoked sashimi!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and I would like to say it's definitely one of my favouriate izakaya. Mainly because I like everything here, the decor and ambience and that it's spacious and not too loud so that you can talk to your friend sitting next to you. Also it's pretty big and clean. The drum doesn't really bother me it just seems like it suits the atmoshpere. 

Overall, I find the food is pretty good. I know some people say the portions are small but I don't mind if it's tasty. Most izakaya's have small portions. I guess maybe some of the dishes are a hit or miss. Since they do change their menu once in a while, they try to make new dishes and theses ones might not be the best. You just have to read reviews and figure out what to order. Here are some of the things I like: 

1) Steamed Shabu Shabu: There's not much to this dish I agree, but just steaming the pork and complementing with the two different sauces really brings out the flavour of the meat. 2) Torched Mackeral and Smoky Hay Salmon: these are my personal favourites and must-haves everytime I come. The Smoky Hay Salmon is so flavourful there's nothing like it. I thought the 3) Hokke butter with garlic, 4) Grilled salmon mayo 5) Takoyaki pizza 6) Tokyo style hot dog were pretty good too. I love the 7)skewers, I usually get those salted. I also reccommend the 8) Ginger fried chicken 9) Black Croquette 10) Potato wedges with curry powder 11) Shrimp Mayo. The 12) Beef bowl was a little dry for me but the 13) Pork rice was delicious, I had seconds. The 14) Stir-fried seafood noodle was definitely not bad. For desserts the 15) Green tea mouse with red bean had really rich green tea flavour. However, the last time I went the black seasame ice-cream was no longer the really black flavourful one.

The Jaja beef was a little weird for me. The beef was tasty but how they bring out the hot plate and you cook it there and mix in the ingredients was kind of strange but it was still good. I find the Agedashi Tofu and Yam cake as well as the Soft Fish Cake lacked flavour. The Fwhat Fwhat Pork was too dry for me. The Atlantic Salmon and Egg salad did not do it for me as well. 

Overall, the service was pretty good, although sometimes I don't understand the servers. My complaint is that they should just give us a pot of tea so they don't have to keep coming back, (or we keep asking them to come back) to refill our tea. The place is spacious and clean and the ambience fun. Most of the food is great with lots of flavours. I don't find the dishes that pricey ( I guess it's all relative), I think most izakayas are around the same price. If you are not willing to spend at least 30 bux to get full then don't come here. I love the food here, I will definitely be returning soon. Just that it's hard to find parking on a busy weekend, might need to walk to nearby parking garages. Also they take reservations which is a +++!"}
{"text":"So much like! Hours of wandering during Nuit Blanche necessitated alcoholic beverages to quench an unshakable thirst and a place to rest our weary feet.  Our friends had been wanting to try this place for a while and in the spirit of spontaneity, we made our way to this second floor izakaya.  To be absolutely cliche, the decor transported us out of the greying concrete jungle outside and into the noisy atmosphere of a Japanese drinking establishment.  

If you don't like noise, this is not the place for you.  Complaining that it doesn't fit one's fine dining sensibilities just makes you look like a fool.  Lots of grilled stuff on sticks and deep fried balls of stuff.  Salty, not-good-for-you bar food goodness!  Really enjoyed the ginger fried chicken.  They also have the really really black sesame ice cream.  Mmm...  Try the nama shochu grapefruit - it's a bit of a novelty where you juice your own half fresh grapefruit and mix that into your alcoholic beverage.

While eager to serve, the service was quite spotty that night.  The water didn't come until well after the drinks came (and we had to ask and remind at least three times).  The drinks didn't come until well after the first snack dish came - and really, how can you eat all that salty bar food without any liquids!  Like I wasn't thirsty enough to begin with...  I've been informed that the drinks are more expensive than Guu, but the food prices are cheaper.

I'd come here again - let's hope the service is a bit better next time."}
{"text":"What i loved about this place is their ginger fried chicken.  Absolutely delicious and it is the only thing on menu that keeps luring me from time to time. Also their plum wine with sake( no idea how it was called). It's on the pricey side thoug..it's on dundas street in downtown core, I can't complain"}
{"text":"With some of the good reviews, I really expected a really lively greeting but alas, I felt quite underwhelmed. Maybe it's not their fault, they're more of a late night deal but my friends and I came for lunch. Regardless of that, I expected better customer service, especially since it wasn't that busy. Like when we walked in, the employees on duty continued to chat instead of seating us. Bummer.

The ramen I had was alright. The contents were fine (flavourful), albeit the soup was slightly saltier than what I'm used to. They did give me a side dishes to eat with it, but I found that it didn't complement my meal as much as I'd hope. 

I really don't have much to say. It's an alright place, but there are many other places I could go for lunch besides this one."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this izakaya but it really is nothing special. Upon arriving, the girl at the door not only did not greet or acknowledge us after making eye contact, she walked away at least two times while we were standing there waiting to be seated. someone else finally seated us but our server was no where to be seen. 

The food was just average, there wasn't anything that really stood out. The charcoal black croquette looked nothing like the picture, it was tiny (kinda like black fried oysters) 

The same girl walked away while I was asking her a question :'( what did i do wronggg...anyways id recommend another izakaya"}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Izakaya experiences in Toronto. Fantastic food and atmosphere. It was on par with the places I've experienced in Tokyo and Osaka. Reasonably priced as well. The service was rather poor though. It took over 45 minutes to get the cheque, pay and get our change.  It was on a busy Saturday night but still that's ridiculously bad... They should have kept with tradition and let people pay at the register on the way out like you're supposed to at these places."}
{"text":"Go to dondon quite often, good vibes but not that 'crazy' like Guu. 
Good location, near where I live. 
Lunch box is nice.
Parking is easy, green p parking lot near by."}
{"text":"We happened to run into this place when strolling along downtown. 

The portion sizes are not huge, but just enough for two people. We had the spicy okra shrimp, it was a little on the salty side, but it was good. We also got grilled fish which was decent as well. We only went into get a quick snack so i cant comment on the main course.

I really like the open kitchen concept. The decor creates a nice atmosphere. The washrooms are clean and beautifully decorated. For the ladies there is a huge mirror with a small stool to sit down and touch up on your make up, which i haven't seen in many places.  The environment is loud and the staff are full of energy. 

If you are all about trying something out of the ordinary, then you must check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm sooo glad to see there's an izakaya boom going on in Toronto, and it's not just the boom (don-don) from the taiko drum at DonDon Izakaya. 

Obligatory stupid review pun out of the way, on to DonDon itself. It definitely has a real Japanese izakaya vibe, with an eclectic menu of (mostly) yummy food and drink so there's something for everyone. I like the many variations on a theme of seafood, which this town can never have enough of. The miso marinated mackerel just melts in your mouth. Mmmm.

The place is also very lively (crowded and loud) like an izakaya should be, but without as much of the yelling from the staff as some places (IRASSHAIMASE!!!! ARIGATOU GOZAIMASU!!!!!!). There is the matter of the unnecessary taiko drumming, but when the place is crowded, it's not that disturbing over the din of conversations and cavorting.

Folks kvetching in other reviews about the service being slow are right that it can be, which is the one big difference between DonDon and an Izakaya in Japan. But even though we were there on a crowded Friday night, it wasn't any worse than any other packed restaurant I've been in in this fair city.

While this is not my favorite Canadian izakaya (I reserve that honour for Suika in Vancouver), it's a very welcome addition to the Toronto cuisinescape."}
{"text":"We've been here many times. It's a fun place to begin the night. You can order lots of different apps and try a bit of everything. All of the seafood options are great, so are the croquettes (you won't want to share them--there are only 3 and they are delicious). I very strongly recommend ordering the smoked tuna/salmon plates. 

I found the service to be OK--they could use more staff I guess. It can fill up some evenings and be incredibly busy/loud.

They have private rooms for larger groups/special events. You have to sit on the floor and take off your shoes--it's really authentic and intimate."}
{"text":"I came here with my BFF because it was close to his place. It's all communal seats and bar seats unless you have a larger party. They gave us a choice of places to sit, and we decided on seating in the middle between two randoms and as we walked in, the hostess beat the drum. It looked fun - I wish I was allowed to do it!

We ordered mostly things that had pictures and said 'recommended!' I did some prior research on Yelp and saw that the Shrimp Mayo was popular. Unfortunately for me, my BFF did not want to try the black croquette things because he said it \"looked weird\".

Beef tataki: this was on the \"special\" menu for $5.90. Pretty good, standard with other beef tatakis. Came with a lot of onion and radish and sauce, could have had more beef.

Shrimp mayo: definitely see why people recommend this. It's a crispy shrimp with the tail removed, fried in a tempura-like batter (but not really tempura?) and covered with sauce. Delicious!

Foie gras: this was weird. It tasted fishy but I thought foie gras was duck? The sauce was pretty much the same as the beef tataki one. Very odd, very weird, and not tasty. I was disappointed with this and would highly recommend avoiding it!

Tako wasabi: very good! The only thing is, it didn't come with seaweed to wrap it in. So I guess they expect you to spoon it onto your own spoon and eat it with nothing? I prefer the ones that provide seaweed a lot more. That's how they usually come where I get it. But based on the tako mix, very good. Needs seaweed!!!!

Chirashi don: We each got one of these. It was really good. Their sauce made it taste even better. I made the mistake of mixing it - it tasted worse after that. Highly recommend, though!

Thwat-thwat pork buns: there was not a lot of meat inside and too much sauce. The bun was not soft and there was too much of it. But still ok tasting despite this haha!

Calpico drink: according to my BFF, it tasted like they poured it directly from a bottle.

Frozen sake, red, $5.50: This was like an alcoholic frozen / blended ice drink with some flavoured red syrup on top. It was quite strong but once I mixed the syrup in and drank it faster, it started tasting better. There was no aftertaste. Fun little drink, I even ate the grapefruit too.

Service was pretty average/good, I would say, other than the small order mistake. Also I would have liked it if the servers spoke more Japanese to us, like saying thank you when taking the bill. But that's no big deal. I also want to mention that I liked the washrooms. Very clean and fancy.

Bill came to $63 after tax before tips. Very pricey for 2 people and I was not even full after. Went for Chatime bubble tea afterwards to fill up.

After reading some pretty bad reviews, and for an izakaya, I would say this exceeded my expectations. No, it's not as good as the izakayas I go to in Vancouver. But I still liked it! I would not go again though because I am getting poor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 10pm with a friend, so it was pretty empty. We ordered the deep fried pork belly, mayo shrimp, the potato and chicken, butter soy ramen, and the smoky hay salmon. Pork belly and potato and chicken were so-so, kind of bland. Would order the Mayo shrimp and butter soy ramen again. Smoky hay salmon- the smokiness was there, however the freshness of the salmon was not. 
Dessert we ordered was the taro potato ice cream and the green tea cheesecake, both which we loved."}
{"text":"At first glance, this place feels like a heart warming Japanese restaurant with a lot of upside. The waitress was nice and quickly sat us down at the bar (although I would have preferred a table instead). We ordered the chicken cartilage w/ curry powder, the black croquette, smoked sashimi and other side dishes. All of the dishes were pretty well made and had its own distinguishing taste. The smoked sashimi literally melted in my mouth !

Although I do understand that Japanese food typically comes in small portions, that would be my only complaint. Our bill came to around 40$ for 4 items, which was a higher than what I expected."}
{"text":"* For whoever read my review , it is a soft four star.

I sucked at the LSAT test, so I went to get conform food on a day \"feels like -22\"
I've always LOVED Izakaya' and that is why I am debating so hard for how I am going to rate this place.

Well my friend went to this place before me (and I was mad about it!), He texted me saying food was good, so I asked him to comparing to Guu or Fin. He just said \"it is different\". 

So of course I wanna know how different ?

Here is the result:

Food in general, 3.5-4 
drink: 2
pirce/quality ratio: 4+

When I just stepped in, I was like.. it is NOT DIFFERENT, the inner deco looks exactly like Guu and so does the dinning environment.  The only different part is they have a drum at the door (I guess that is why they called Dondon Izakaya but I could be wrong)

The menu is pure just print out, but I was okay with it.  However, there is not much choice for cocktail and they do not have the special lemonade, (the one with the glass ball) . For beer or sake lovers, my comments might not be fair since I didn't pay attention other than cocktails. Luckily, They have Chu-Hi, so my friend  ordered YUZU Chu-hi. When the drink is served, they forgot to tell us which one is which, so we picked the wrong one, but the drink was good.

We ordered chicken salad with plum sauce, I didn't like it. Although the texture of chicken is great but didn't feel they mixed well with the salad.

The \"milk tofu\" was great, but both my friend and I agreed that it could be even better if they come with a sweet sauce rather than soy sauce, so that it can bring out the rich  milk flavor.

Also ordered Japanese style hot dog, with chicken and Kimmi, liked it.\" Pan fried beef \", like stone grill in fin. But the this dish @ fin,  However, both the meat and vege are marinated. Although this one came with BBQ sauce (which is great sauce), the taste is still not as good. One more thing is, the pan tend to be too small, so when we put the vege in, it is already cold. 

A steamed Shabu-shabu. I learned from a book that is the way people cook it in Kyushu. Steam meat with vegetable under. Taste good.

Skewer combination, i can only say.. not bad.

Overall, it is good. Not as creative as Guu, and they can make better arrangement for seats. My friend and I sit beside a 3 people group, feels awkward. 

Dinning environment is very much like Guu, loud but not as loud. They sing cheerful birthday songs for people too. (Price is cheapter too)

I bear in mind the fact they they just opened for a short time, so all the service and other flaws (or menus) can be changed in the future. It takes time to make a good restaurant better. So my recommendation level is 4 star!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with friends a couple years ago and once again this past Friday. I remember having a great time the first time, but the food quality and portion sizes felt pretty average.

We had the aburi salmon, saba, beef tataki, rayu udon, and pork oyster mushroom.

The most painful part was the payment process - we were a group of 7 and they would not split bills but also would only take ONE credit card for payment for the whole table. This was a surprise to me since it seems like a place that caters to groups."}
{"text":"Don Don Izakaya is located on the second level building at Bay and Dundas in the heart of the downtown core.  There was an elevator for those who need it as well.  They serve Japanese tapas.

When we entered, the staffed greeted us with loud and enthusiastic Japanese greetings.  It was just before 7 p.m. on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't full yet.  The hostess led us to sit at the bar in front of the TV where all of the sake and alcohol were.  I preferred to sit at the communal tables to have a better experience (to watch the chefs make the food in the middle of the room); I wasn't interested in sitting at the bar (I only like sitting at the bar if it's in front of an open kitchen where there's something to watch).  However, the hostess said that those communal tables were reserved for parties greater than two people.  Hmm...  I remember being a bit annoyed at this because there were clearly spaces at the communal tables.  Also, I remembered sitting there when I was there last time and we were only a party of two too.  Anyway, this isn't a big deal looking back but I remember at the time being slightly annoyed to have to sit at the bar when I saw empty seats at the tables.  (I could see a party of three sitting at one of those middle tables.  How big of a difference was two people versus three people for them to get a seat at the table and we weren't able to?)

Our \"A Set\" sake tasting set came first.  Our three sample sakes included the Takara Plum Wine, Gekkeikan Black & Gold, and the Hakutsuru Junmai.  I remember really enjoying the plum wine. 

The DONDON Special Black Croquette was made with breadcrumbs, shrimp, and mayonnaise.  It tasted cheesy to me and it was fairly good.

The Shiokara was salted squid \"guts\".  It was a really small dish.  It was definitely salty and not something that everyone would enjoy eating due to its distinctive fishy taste.  It was very chewy.

The Three Seafood Appetizer Set included spicy seaweed, clams, and scallops (mantle).  The spicy seaweed wasn't actually too spicy.  While the clams and scallops were good, the pieces were soooo small!  It was definitely good when served with drinks but the pieces were too small to be satisfying.

The Torched Mackerel was actually torched table-side.  We watched the torch action happen.  This was a substantial dish where there were a lot of slices of mackerel on the plate!  The mackerel was quite good.  I especially liked the daikon that was on the side.

I think my favourite dish that night was the Teppan Grilled Fatty Pork.  The fatty pork pieces were served with yuzu and chili pepper paste.  The pieces were very firm and tender!

Last but not least, we had the 5 Skewers Combo.  This had chicken thigh, angus beef, pork green onion, zucchini bacon, and oyster-mushroom bacon.  This was quite good and I remember enjoying the vegetables between the skewer meats too.

While some of the latter items that we were ordered were good, I had fonder memories of my first visit to Don Don Izakaya.  I think we ordered more filling dishes the first time I was there and the service was a little better too when dining at the communal tables."}
{"text":"2.5*

I was so looking forward to DonDon Izakaya (mostly because it didn't have the Guu-famed lineups).  

It is located at Dundas & Bay on the second floor.  In addition to the group chime of Irashaimase, you will also get a drum beating to usher you in.  

DonDon's interior is made mostly of bamboo and wood with large communal tables, and some bar seats at their open-concept kitchen.

The one thing I found extremely helpful was their menu as it contained pictures of many of their dishes.  

For me, the lack of service was a sour note.  While there were many bodies floating around, everyone seemed to be occupied and it took several tries to finally get our orders taken.

The food at DonDon was a disappointment for me.  You had a choice of bland or too salty and the food itself lacked any distinct flavours.  You will find a lot of deep-fried items, a lot of potato/creamy items and the garnishes they use are used exhaustively and repetitively (mayonnaise, mayonnaise and more mayonnaise).  I am confident in saying this because we ordered some $350 worth of food and beverage split between 6 people, so we sampled most of their menu.

The items that I did like were:

Black Croquettes - This came with a side of ketchup.  The outer shell was perfectly crispy and the inside creamy and soft.  It was a textural symphony.

Pork Kimchi Udon - I am a huge fan of udon, and the flavours worked really well with the kimchi.  My only complaint is that it wasn't really spicy enough.

Fried Mackarel Mayo - The use of this fatty fish was a good call.  It just melted in your mouth and the mayonnaise made it even more luscious!

Plum Wine Jelly - This was an interesting dessert, but very refreshing.  While it is sweet, the plum wine adds a bit of a bitter ending to it, but not an unpleasant one.

I was pretty disappointed with my experience at DonDon.  Next time I'm in the mood for izakaya, I'll gladly wait in line for Guu.  Or maybe wait for Kingyo to open up shop in Toronto in the near future."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I are from out of town and wanted to go to a place with fun atmosphere and good food.  This place was underwhelming on both points.  The croquets are indeed amazing, but that was the only thing.  Sake was good but not anything we couldn't enjoy elsewhere.  There are definitely better izakayas elsewhere.  Definitely don't recommend this place for the price."}
{"text":"To be honest, my score is 1.5 star. Because of friendly staff there, I put 0.5 on DonDon. Otherwise, it's 1.0. Personally, I won't come back by myself.

I know I'm tend to be hard on Japanese restaurants since I'm Japanese, BUT...

1. They don't bring food in manner. Please don't bring Kushi-age(fried stick meat and vegetable AFTER we had dessert!

2. Since I am almost vegetarian, I didn't try all of dishes which my friends ordered (meat, seafood etc.), but some. Those few dishes were just OK kinds They were very salty. 

3. I doubted about quality of the ingredients there - plus, I heard a strange story about them from one of my Japanese friends afterwards.

Atmosphere wise, it's fun.  I may come back DonDon for my friends who love Sake or sharing the fun atmosphere. But I won't be there with hungry stomach. That's for sure."}
{"text":"The service was good. The variety of food available on the menu is okay. The food itself is meh. Go to Guu or Nome instead, even if there is a massive line up. Don don just isn't worth the visit."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 and a half. Its def quiter and more chill than Guu, but sometimes thats a good thing! Sometimes you just wanna be able to chill with a pitcher of Sapporo and talk with friends. 

Sometimes they have a special menu, and I would totally recommend the shirokara. Be warned, it is an acquired taste and it is difficult to eat, even for some native Japanese people. But its $4, and when you wash it down with beer, it goes great. 

A bit pricey, but I would just go here for some polar pints and a few snacks."}
{"text":"Waiting time is so much longer than the other Izakayas I 've been. Hostess told us it would be 30 minuets waiting,but she kept letting the Customers behind us go first. I guess that is because they need to arrange the number of people. But I still felt bad to be left only us outside.I understand it must be the rush time, but I think it is ridiculous to rake reservations in an Izakaya. And the food I am so sorry that's shocked me as well. The picture is the smoked salmon for 14 bucks, kinda of pricy for those tiny shaggy cube ... taste only the smoke but nothing..."}
{"text":"Very cool experience loud fun and interesting menu items. The hay smoked fish is a must. The food is good quality. The bill adds up because u will want to try everything.  Great if u like to try new things."}
{"text":"its envitable that you would compare this place to Guu. It has the same feel, decor and ethusiatic server, but with the added bonus of a big Taiko drum.  

It wasnt a surprise to me that our wait was about 30mins on Friday night, but they need to accomodate for the crowds. The small hallway is so crowded, and not comfy to wait at.

I have to say I was disappointed that because of some confusion, when we came in, we didnt get a drum entrance nor did we get a fanfare when we left. We were sad.  You know, I suspect that the owner has the drum there so he can bang on it to release stress. 

We sat at the bar, and it was lovely that where was hooks for my purse and jacket. The wide stools made it more comfortable.  We got the pleasure of watching the bar folks make drinks, and it was non stop. 

The food we ordered was good and filling, but the selection, although vast, there wasnt much outside of our picks that I would come back for.  Unlike Guu, they did not have daily specials, so the menu would stay the same. Maybe this will change. 

Everything we ordered was super tasty.
- squid ink potatoe croquettes - black breaded rolls, filled with a mix of fish and shrimp, creamy and tasty, with ketchup on the side for some zing
- two types of japadogs - we got the teriyaki one- good, but seemed like a filler dish
- the salmon hay smoked sashimi was a treat - but the tiny portion at $11.50 leaves you questioning it
- the steamed shabu shabu was good, but i felt like i could have made it at home. but at $4.50 its worth gettting
- fwhat fwaht pork bun - it wasnt anyhting special, but tasty none the less - really soft bun
- kimchi udon was spicy and really good - its a portion good enough to share
- the chicken and corn udon is a great creamy choice too

having pics on the menu really helped in deciding, for sure

for dessert, we shared the green tea mouse with red bean. so tasty.

The service was okay. our food came quickly, but they dont really pay attention to you unless you try and flag them down. you think they would want to turn over seating quickly - but instead we were chatting for an hour after we finished our mains.

I would come back here, but maybe for lunch, when there is less of a rush."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night at around 8pm with one other person. Walked about 5 minutes from Dundas square and walked upstairs to where the restaurant was. We were greeted with a beating drum and a warm welcome from the staff. It was busy but we got seats immediately by the bar so we can see the chefs cook.

Food ***
 We ordered the seafood udon, karaage chicken, tako wasabi, shrimp croquette, and mochi balls along with a pitcher of Sapporo. All the food tasted good though the karaage chicken is a must order. We saw endless orders of karagee chicken sitting by the cooks and it was delicious. Portions vary by food item. There was a lot of karaage given and the udon was huge but the shrimp croquette and tako wasabi seemed a bit small for the price.

Service ****
 Waiters were kind and attentive, only having to hold my hand up for a few seconds before they flagged us down. We bantered a lot with the chefs cooking in front of us and they were all friendly, even when I jokingly tried to steal some karaage chicken for other people.

Ambiance *****
 The place was well decorated, no windows looking out, but the overall vibe was friendly and fun, with drums beating while a cook sears a salmon, or people cheering doing sake bombs. 

Tips/Closing comments
 - Order the karaage chicken!
 - They have a dice game where you pay $6 and you can win drinks that are worth $20 or a coke depending on your roll, always fun to do on a date or in a group of friends 
 - Don Don Izakaya, while a bit pricey, is a place with good vibes, great decorations mixed with delicious izakaya eats. Wouldn't hesitate coming back one bit"}
{"text":"Don Don isn't a place you should consider bringing a friend. That is unless you want to de-friend them. My words may seem harsh in this review, so I bare warning now for those with sensitive eyes and sweet, innocent souls. 

Don Don is a set back from what Guu created for the Izakaya scene. The creativity, detail to preparation, and price-to-portion ratio are all shattered by a less than mediocre restaurant. In fact, I was a bit offended with how much they charged for how little the dishes were. My appetite gauge was no where near full after $58 bill between 3 people.

Like Guu, they yell and scream to welcome you into their dining room. Like Guu, they have coat racks in the front to hang your jackets. Like Guu, they offer bar-side or communal table seating and like Guu, they have the Chu-Hi and Calpico Sours for your thirst quenching needs. So pretty much nothing new- just a big drum they beat in addition to the screaming when you walk in.

Unlike Guu, they do not offer a daily specials menu, which is fine if they offered great dishes from their house menu (which is not the case). Their menu, however, has pictures of most of the dishes! But this is necessary considering how simply they describe their dishes (E.g. shrimp+mayonnaise+parsley = mayo shrimp or potato+chicken+sauce = okonomiyaki??). I never knew garnishes needed to be said in the description...

Anyways, I didn't find the menu too appealing at all. Although a long menu, surprisingly, most dishes seemed really boring or really over priced. We ordered the pork buns, black croquettes, kimchi Tokyo dog, and chicken skewers.
All were disappointing and much smaller than expected. The pork buns are tasty but not that special. They weren't pork belly, but instead a take on the Chinese red-cooked pork done with a weak execution. The black croquettes were the size of a roll of nickels. Without a word of a lie, they tasted like a smooth mash of a Highliner Fish Stick with pork bits inside. That was the most disappointing dish of the meal. The hot dog was almost as underwhelming, as I expected a hotdog to resemble that you find on the street in a cart. This was a mix of kimchi with a halved Vietnamese sausage, which was not good on the palette and hardly had any meat whatsoever.

The one thing they did well were the drinks. Affordable and refreshing, but they are still comparable with those at Guu.

Overall, I was very disappointed with the food I had. As though Don Don came into the Izakaya game blind, unknowing of the competition, tastes or preparation used to prepare similar dishes. I found everything done at Don Don, sub-par and undeserving of the initial hype it's currently receiving. I respect the ideas, people and culture Don Don is trying to cultivate, but they should really respect their customers in return."}
{"text":"This was a stop of convenience. I was in the area with a friend and I was in the mood for Asian cuisine!

1) It's on the second floor but there is an elevator so make sure to look for it if accessibility is an issue.

2) It can be very dark but the atmosphere is very authentic. Everyone speaks Japanese or at least I think it's Japanese... They also drum a lot. I don't know why but it happens. They also have traditional Japanese seating areas in the back. It looked cool but there were only 2 of us and these tables sat many. We sat at the bar. The bartender made some pretty fancy drinks. But I'm a Sapporo in a pitcher kinda classy so I can comment and say that the beer was good.

3) Had chicken skewers and the ramen. It was good and maybe my rating is a bit harsh but nothing really blew my mind. I had no complaints, it just wasn't special. No doubt that it's a fun Izakaya and not very loud like other establishments of a similar genre can get and it's a nice night out. 

It was just underwhelming!"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs to have a higher rating! I went for dinner yesterday with a friend and really enjoyed. We got ginger fried chicken, seafood noodles, smoked tuna sashimi and the shrimp mayo. Everything was delicious, I would say my least favourite was the seafood noodles. The fried chicken was the best - juicy and flavourful. The sashmi was really interesting and different with its smoked flavour, and the shrimp mayo was good as it usually is at these places. The ambience was relaxed but fun, and the service was really good. I got a  Yuzu Calpico Sour as a cocktail to try. It was perfect - not too sweet not too strong. 

I would definitely go to this izakaya again - it's way better than Kinko Izakaya for what it's worth."}
{"text":"PROS:

1. First off the decor is impressive. Toasted bamboo walls everywhere makes the place look warm and smokey. Upon your arrival the host will announce it to the entire restaurant by banging on a big drum. A bit comical and surprising. 

2. I got the Spicy lunch bento box. REALLY SPICY & sooo good! I enjoyed the variety in the bento. 

3. Services is quick and friendly. 

4. The bathroom was spotless! 

CONS:

1. I wouldn't say the food was special enough for me to want to go back. Ie., I could get this kind of food elsewhere. But I would take someone who hasn't gone yet to see the decor.

OVERALL:

-I'd go back for happy hour and try the night food they have
-I'd go back but only with someone who hasn't gone yet"}
{"text":"Beef don: meat is dry, rice is slightly undercooked.
Ramen: soup taste like instant noodle soup, egg is definitely overcooked, noodle is hard, the meat is too thick and the way you guys cut the meat make it too easy to stuck in the teeth.
The black deep fried shrimp purée thing:  3 pieces, as big as my thumb, almost 8 dollars, and I'm actually surprise that you guy give ketchup as dipping sauce ?!!!
The skewers is so normal..."}
{"text":"Environment very similar to Guu. Portions are generous. The dishes are pretty standard and having had most of them at other Japanese Izakaya restaurants, I'd have to rate the dishes an overall 3/5 in comparison."}
{"text":"There was a spicy tofu with pork that really disappointed me. I thought it would be the korean or Japanese style of spicy tofu and pork belly according to their picture on menu. But the truth is that it's Mapo tofu and it's not the authentic Chinese Mapo tofu. I even confirmed with the girl took my order to make sure it's not Mapo tofu but it turned out it was. Watch out for that one. Also, it's quite dark in the restaurant and very crowded. I was sitting at the bar and I lost my scarf that I bought from Europe. Watch out your stuff!!"}
{"text":"On a busy street, right off of Dundas Square is a discreet little restaurant within a discreet brown building. As you ascend the stairs, you hear it, quietly at first (dondon). What was that? You continue up the stairs, feeling like you've stepped into a portal that has bridged together Toronto and Japan. Japanese posters and decorations enter your peripheral. Dondon! There it is again, the rhythmic pounding. You reach the top, pull back the black curtain, and a wave of deliciousness hits your nostrils. DON DON DON DON! IRASSHAIMASE! 

And there it is. Happy faces striking a Japanese drum. And you are led through a high-energy, dynamic space with the promise of good food, good drink, and good times. 

Good food: Dondon has an amazing range of shareable goodies that go from $5 to $20. No, you're not going to classify it as \"cheap eats\", but it certainly gives you quality for your money. Best to come with a big group so you can try as much as you can. My recommendations: black croquettes, wasabi octopus with seaweed, chicken cartilage, karaage, and torched salmon sushi. 

Good drink: Alcohol and more alcohol! Fantastic variety of drinks including sake tasting menus ($~20) and special cocktails. There are a bunch of creative non-alcoholic drinks as well for those that can't hold their liquor (me). I recommend the Pomegrenate Calpico. 

Good times: Great choice for larger groups, as mentioned before. They've got sectioned off areas with traditional Japanese tables for larger groups. Just a note, there is an auto 15% gratuity with these tables and you have to take off your shoes. The server wasn't very clear when we asked about this and then halfway through the meal, another server (better English) came by and told us to take them off. Other than that, the service was top-notch, with that signature sense of Japanese courtesy. 

Dondon is one of the many Izakayas popping up in Toronto and definitely a worthy competitor. It's a perfectly lively atmosphere, inviting all to add their voices to the sound of upbeat chatter and beating drums. Despite the average rating, I promise you, you DON want to miss out. ;)

(87/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner+drinks the night before Canada Day (Tues) with a group of 10. The restaurant itself is quite big for an Izakaya; although we made reservations, we would've still had seats. The atmosphere is typical of an Izakaya, it was loud, dark, and bustling.

Food: The food here left much to be desired and did not live up to the price tag. The dishes I enjoyed were beef tataki, mayo shrimp, and torched mackerel. However with the torched mackerel, they didn't heat the plate so the fish ended up hot near the top and cold at the bottom. You only get 5 pieces of beef tataki and 5 mayo shrimps. Their portion sizes are definitely small. They had a beef teriyaki burger special, which was not great. Finally the Tokyo style hot dog upon first taste was delicious, but because of the high amounts of spicy mayo, it got salty very fast. The bun was also slightly burnt.

Drinks: For an izakaya they have a very impressive selection of sake. I'm not very knowledgable in that area but it's great that they have so many choices. They had a great special that day of $10 Sapporo pitchers. We were very happy about that. Reading some previous yelp reviews, I decided to go with the Sake Freezie Red (pomegranate-grapefruit slush style drink). It was one of the worst cocktails I've ever had. It was like drinking artificial, concentrated, candy with ice. Would not recommend. The house hot sake however was very nice and smooth.

Service: Their service was not great. The servers did not come around very often, and assumed we were going to share all the food. We understood that was the way Japanese people ate but the server only took orders from a few people (out of 10).

Overall I would not come back here just because of the price. We each forked out $40 at the end of the night and I can confidently say none of us were well fed. I know izakaya food is that way but it should at least be good quality. I would not recommend coming here to eat, but maybe for drinking sake due to their large selection."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty bad. I'm only giving it a couple of stars for the half decent food but you can get good food and good service elsewhere. My boyfriend and I were seated at the end of the bar which smelt like the washroom. We asked to be moved so they sandwiched us between a bunch of people when there were empty tables everywhere. That wasn't even the bad part. No one came to take our order or even offer water for at least 20 minutes. Our food came swiftly after we finally did and while we were eating we were asked to shuffle down to make room for an extra person. Who did not come. First and final visit here."}
{"text":"I visited there at Monday 10:30pm. There were about 4 servers working, but we didn't get any service after we sat down for 15mins. We had 2 people and we wanted a dinning table, there were 5 more people came after us. We were asked to changed table and they offered us a glass of calpis with sake. That's nice.

The food there were okay. The limited time promotion Sapporo was good. A pitcher of sapporo was only $9.99. However, on the other hand, food was not good for me. The salmon sashimi was not fresh enough, and the Chirashi rice didn't with the sushi rice. It came with warm rice without rice vinegar taste. I was disappointed with that."}
{"text":"I went here with a party of 12 for my birthday and overall it was a really fun experience! Go here for the experience and you won't be disappointed! Go here expecting culinary perfection - you might be a little dissapointed. 

Positives: 

- menu selection- the izakaya experience is really fun! If you love trying new dishes, unconventional items, this is a great place for that. The selection is vast and interesting! Makes for great culinary experience - even when I ended up getting something i didn't like, it was fun to sample and share and experiment.

- atmosphere - great decor and atomsphere, the party booth was perfect for a large group. Busy and buzzy but not chaotic like Guu.

- drinks were cheap! Saki selection huge.

Negatives:
- inconsistency in service. Some dishes took up to 45 minutes to deliver while others were ready speedily. Some staff were friendly and others seemed annoyed or had to be chased down. Some manage complaints or issues with food really well but others made it a big deal which is annoying. 

- food quality a little less than competitor Guu. Some items pricier than they should be for the quality."}
{"text":"Terrible service, had to ask the waitress for everything and she hardly spoke English. Prices are very expensive for the small portions. I do have to admit the Chu-Hi and the Chirashi rice was very flavorful! :) That's where the two stars come from, but I'm still hungry after"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and had a great meal in a great atmosphere. Unlike Guu which is always too noisy, this place was a little more subdued but not quiet, so the atmosphere was still there. All the food served was great, but my favourite was the grilled yellowtail."}
{"text":"I always go to Yelp before deciding whether or not a restaurant deserves my patronage. Anyway, my mother really wanted to check out Don Don so I decided to go regardless of the not so great reviews here.

Enjoyed myself here. The food was pretty good and it wasn't overly expensive. I like the decor of this place and it's quite spacious so it's a perfect setting for a group get together. Being able to take a reso is a huge plus in my books. They offer a happy hour special - $19 for a pitcher of Japanese beer and an app.

The only downside would be the service. Our server was a nice guy, but completely spaced out. My mother and I spoke Japanese to our server, but the table beside us was having trouble with their server due to a language barrier.

Some things I tried tonight:
* Avocado Croquet - skip
* Chicken Pita - delish, there was sauer kraut in it, which added to it
* Karaage - fried chicken, hard to mess up
* Hoppe Yaki - a keeper
* Okra and Spicy Shrimp - great
* Ebi Mayo - jackpot !
* Strawberry and Chocolate Risotto - pretty cool idea

Don Don is a four star for me and I wouldn't mind coming back here with a large group."}
{"text":"You'll walk in feeling like a boss, as they hit the gong to let everyone know that you've arrived. And everyone will clap and make a fuss over your arrival. 5/5 for ego boosting.

Food was good, although if you're not used to eating small portions for above average prices, look elsewhere. If you can get full off a squid tentacle, you'll enjoy DonDon. If you like sugary plum wine, you'll like DonDon. If you like waitresses that fulfill all of your weaboo fantasies, you'll LOVE DonDon.

Ambience is cool. Only issue was the music - they feel the need to blast crappy hip-hop and dance music as you attempt to impress your seemingly unimpressed date by bragging about your lame job and \"hobbies\".

3/5 overall."}
{"text":"If you're in the neighbourhood and hungry this isn't a bad choice - but it is not a place we would go out of my way to visit. Food is tasty, but not remarkable in anyway.

The Gyudon didn't have a lot of meat, no glass noodles and no egg. The sauce was a solid \"okay\".

The tonkatsu spicy ramen had a nice broth, just not enough of it. There were lots of noodles, but they were just OK - nothing to make it stand out. In fairness, though, the generous pieces of pork belly were delicious - seared nicely and just the right proportion of tender meat and melt in your mouth fat.

The ginger chicken appetizer has no discernible ginger, but the crunchy batter was great and the chicken was moist.

The beef tataki was nicely done and probably the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"A very interesting Japanese restaurant. The atmosphere is very relaxing, staff is all very friendly and helpful. I usually go there for lunch and they have great specials - everything from Ramen, Sushi, Bento Boxes, chicken teriyaki, and lots of different types of Sake (they even have samplings if you are a fan). All the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the place to go for good izakaya. Their ingredients are subpar and the taste is off. They don't have proper ginger, don't use 'real' sushi rice for their sushis and the kimchi tastes like ketchup. The only good dish that we tried was the salmon belly. Service is ok - we kept having to ask them for things (water refill, wasabi, soy sauce) which was annoying but once we got their attention, they were responsive."}
{"text":"I had friends tell me about this place, and the \"drum\" they have. I had a vision of a large drum, in which they would enthusiastically rhythmically hit, and scream \"IRRASHIMASE\". Let me tell you: nope. I came here for lunch, so maybe the vibe wasn't as \"bumping\", but it literally was the saddest drum hit I've ever heard. 

We had the salmon don, spicy ramen and grilled pork belly don. The don's were ok, it was one of those things where it tasted great at first, then the flavour just got boring after the third bite (even if the meal came with other things). The salad dressing was REALLY good though. I enjoyed that, alot. 

I also got the pomegranate calpico, which tasted like it contained grapefruit, because of the bitterness. So I asked the server if it was the right drink... which she answered yes, then I asked her if it contained grapefruit... in which she answered no. So.... I don't know. 

THEN THE RAMEN. omg, horrid. Also, we found a piece of steel wool in the bowl. We contacted the server, and she was great at handling the situation, so we have no hard feelings about that. Plus, mistakes happen, so it really wasn't a big deal. 

It was the very end which got me leaving unhappy. As we were leaving, typically they would yell out some sort of japanese phrase, and the server who sees us go, would initiate it. So when the server yelled \"They are leaving now\" in Japanese, the main kitchen chef just said (in japanese)\"I know.\", in a rude tone. I assume it was because of the steel wool in the ramen, as I did see the server tell him. 

That left me with a very sour feeling, and for that, I would probably never return."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Izakayas, maybe I was too tired that day but I was a bit disappointed. 
The weird black nuggets with schrimp were a good surprise but nothing terrific. 
The sashimi salad was very fresh, but the pork belly mini buns were a bit disappointing. 
It's good but too expensive in my opinion, I'll try some place else next time."}
{"text":"We ordered the sea foie gras, shaka shaka nankotsu, pork belly bao, chicken burger, and matcha red bean dessert. 

The shaka shaka nonkotsu, and matcha red bean dessert was my favourite. I always like to come here for the matcha red bean dessert, simple and delicious matcha pudding with sweet red bean paste and whipped cream on top. Shaka shaka nonkotsu was so fun! It was pieces of chicken placed in a paper bag, which you shake to mix the flavours, well seasoned and crispy. 

The foie gras was a popular item on the menu, however, I was not a fan. It was too light, almost watery in consistency. I like the uniqueness of the dish, but not my idea of foie gras. The chicken burger was also a flop, bun was a bit soggy, and you can get much better burgers elsewhere. 

Overall verdict: Food can be a give or take, but the atmosphere and service is great."}
{"text":"I went with my friends on a Sunday night and it was packed. I thought this would be a good place for some bites but I was dead wrong. First, the noodles were lukewarm and we were thinking that it came out of the microwave or a batch that was pre-made as it came out literally 2 min after our orders were placed. In hindsight, we should have returned it right away.

The fried oysters and the tako wasabi were the best,. The sashimi salad was not memorable to say the least. Overall, I would not return after the disappointing meal. It is surprising that so many people were coming to eat there."}
{"text":"Great place and actually reminded us of Japan places!  Very good service, ambiance and great food.   Like most Izakaya places the portions are not overly generous so you must order a rice if you are hungry.   The tuna sashimi is a must have - literally melts in your mouth....we ended up ordering multiple orders of it!   And the sake is not crazy over priced either.   Another decent choice to consider!"}
{"text":"People yell hello in Japanese at you when you pop in. Interior was dark and trendy. Good thing we sat at the bar so we had some light! 

We came here because we weren't too hungry but we also wanted some cute eats. We got chirashi and a whole ton of that smoky hay sashimi (various types). I believe we got smoked hay tuna, salmon, and some other fish. 

Chirashi was pretty disappointing. I don't expect a $25 quality bowl but there was way too little fish in the rice. The rice still had the sushi vinegar mixed in there, which is par, but IMO they could have put more varieties of fish on top. Really? Only salmon and maybe one piece of squid? Talk about budgeting. 

Smoked hay sashimi was pretty great! We loved the layers of flavour it had and it wasn't so overwhelming that the taste of the fish was lost. Def a good combo. I totally recommend the... non-triangular piece. I feel like it isn't salmon but I honestly can't remember the name of it. 

I deducted 2 stars because service wasn't amazing. It was pretty hard to flag down a person and it wasn't even super busy. It was also pretty hot. :("}
{"text":"Been here twice now, both times a hit. Great ambience, very friendly staff, they announce your entrance 'Izakaya' style :)

Food menu is fun, I am never disappointed by what I order. Except...for the tokyo hot, an 'interesting' item with kimchi and other flavours. Wouldnt order it again, but sure had fun trying it out.

Amazing sake and drink menu. I opted for sweet sake last night (sorry terrible with names) and loved it. I've had their cocktails before, also a good bet.

Washrooms are so nice! total bonus."}
{"text":"I went last week for a late dinner, on a Saturday night...the place was packed!  They DO accpet reservations and was given a table, however decided to eat at the chef's table instead.  Had I not sat there I think I would have missed out on a lot of the charm. The food was fantastic, high energy environement  but relaxed at the same time.  I had wonderful service and the waiter was helpful.  I was happy that pictures were on the menu to really give me a good idea of what I was ordering.
Everything was so tasty!  I would return."}
{"text":"This place is comparable to Guu, but it's definitely more affordable. You can come here just as a casual lunch or dinner without having to break the bank. 

The service is quite nice, they are swift and will get you seated and drinks as soon as they can. This place, like Guu, has that izakaya atmosphere where they are loud and yell across the room for spirit. I like it better though, because they are not as loud and obnoxious as Guu, and you will still be able to hold a conversation while eating.

The only time I've experienced something bad was that there was a bug (I think it was one of those fish bugs) in my sushi- I guess it really WAS super fresh..
I'm not completely repulsed by it and didn't want to make a scene so I just told the waiter, and he was completely disgusted and apologetic immediately. He got me a new one right away and told me the food was on the house.
Now, I'm not too picky, but I thought that was really nice service- (compared to destiny who refused to give a free drink even when there were roaches found in that guy's bubbletea) Thanks dude!

Also, unlike Guu, this place can actually fill you up and satiate your hunger. The portions are not HUGE but they're enough, and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really great, it makes you feel like you're in a authentic Japanese izakaya. Unfortunately, the food doesn't meet the same standards. It's mediocre at best.

I ordered the Oyakodon and it was tasty yet small. The selection of sake however is quite varied.

I suggest you give this place a try but also look somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places I've been with my friend to have a nice time drinking and great Japanese food. The atmosphere is great and cheery and for sure loud (evening time). Never had any bad experiences when going there 4 times already. It's just so fun to be there and be welcomed by all the servers and cooks as they yell welcome in Japanese. Would definitely recommend anyone to go with friends if they are looking into have a good time during the evening."}
{"text":"I think this place has changed a lot since coming here a couple years ago. The food is definitely not on par and tasted really weird...

Came here for lunch and ordered their Tuna in 3 ways. So the set came with a soup, a salad, 3 side dishes (one was fried chicken which was good, but the other two were super weird and tasted really weird (see photos attached)...we had no idea what they were o_o and didn't touch it after the first taste), there was torched tuna (I think?), mushed up tuna, and tuna sashimi. The tuna tasted really bad and old...The servers were also always no where to be found.

Overall I did not enjoy my experience here. I've been here for dinner and it was okay so maybe just the lunch sets were bad? Anyhoo - if you do come, don't get what I got!! :P"}
{"text":"Went there with my friend for lunch.

My friend ordered a beef teriyaki while I tried a spicy seafood noodle. The food there is honestly not bad. The entire place are very Japanese-style decorated with a transparent kitchen service where you can see how they cook. There is also a big and long bar counter. You can see it once you enter the restaurant.

For the service, I think they still have a potential improvement. The food delivery is not so fast which cost my friend wait around 30 minutes to get her food. Afterwards, when we want to get our bill, we asked them for twice before they brought us the bill and finish the payment.

Overall, I like the food there and it will be a much better restaurant if the service become more focused."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been going to Kinka and Kintaro for the longest time, so we thought it was time to try something new. We stumbled upon this and went in. 

On a Saturday night, it wasn't as loud as Kinka but there was definitely some kind of atmosphere. We ordered a pitcher (which was more expensive than both) only to find out about the $12 pitcher special on Sundays. We also got the buta-don (pork on rice), the korokke (black croquettes), and beef tataki. All the dishes were made fast and they were delicious! Though I would say they're more expensive than kinka's small dishes. 

We will definitely be returning here next Sunday for the $12 pitchers.

EDIT: Came back here for the $12 pitchers. So worth it. The karaage is to die for! It's not just breaded chicken, but it's actually light and you can taste the tenderness of the chicken. 

Also came here for lunch for the chirashi don, which was quite small and disappointing. Oh well, it's an izakaya!"}
{"text":"Service was good staff very helpful in recommending items and popular dishes even paring with alcohol or not.  Had the chicken skewer it was so good we ordered a second.  The beef was okay not as tender and a little bland. My fav was the salmon carppacio very tasty and fresh and second the ginger fried chicken both reco by the  server. They also have some specials worth trying."}
{"text":"i went here ago not too long ago and OMG THEY HAVE RAMEN NOWWW YAYYYYYYYYYU AUAYAYAYAYAYYA

i remember last time they didn't have any sort of ramen/udon option which made me SO DAMN UPSET

anyways i ordered the spicy ramen and it was absolutely delicious. it looked like it was hella spicy, but do not get scared by how it looks, it was actually not spicy at all... it was very tolerable. other than the spiciness, the ramen and soup base was to die for. it actually tastes very similar to raku ramen and izakaya at new kennedy square. oh and it comes in a set. there was rice and two side dishes (i was like hella full at the end) i assumed the rice was for the leftover ramen soup ... very delish, much recommend 

for drinks, I ordered ... i forgot its name LOL i think it was something along the lines of pomegranate blah blah ... ANYWAYS it was pretty good. i have no idea if it had alcohol in it. couldn't really taste it ... it was like in three parts: top was ice and chopped strawberries, middle was the alcohol? the soda drink? idfk, and the bottom was what i assumed was the pomegranate flavouring sugar whatever... im so bad at this LOOL FORGIVE ME...but anyways mixing them together was so good. the pomegranate made it quite sweet so the soda or whatever the hell it was neutralizes it a bit and the strawberries add a bit of tartness to the drink which just harmonizes and brings the whole drink together :') so good (it's like heaven for me but idk about y'all so don't sue me if it bad) 

OVERALL THE ADDED RAMEN OPTIONS MADE ME SO HAPPY AND NOW I CRAVE TO GO THERE ALL THE TIME 

p.s. tried to go here today for lunch (a sad saturday) and found out it doesn't open till like 5 pm T^T (around dinner time -_-)
OF ALL DAYS MAN"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for dinner. The decor is nice. The staircase has a really weird smell to it, not very welcoming. 

And the food? All their traditional izakaya dishes have a western twist to it. Takoyaki? It's a pizza. Karaage chicken? Taco. I thought it was a notice touch, because maybe they wanted to be different from all the other restaurant that serve the same thing! 

The taco was made from an Old El Paso taco kit, with an awful amount of mayo and the chicken was not crispy. I didn't even want to touch that \"pizza\". We ordered the grilled quid as well. The dish actually looked a lot better than the picture on the menu but I thought the sauce was a bit too overwhelming. 

I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Come for drinks and the atmosphere, and hang out with friends. 
Food wise - just stick to the recommended items on their menu (it will tell you which one) and don't expect portion sizes you'd find at other Asian restaurants in the nearby area. The non-popular dishes are really not that good and you won't be happy paying for them on your bill.

Service is good when it is not busy, but when it is, it's still not bad. 

For comparison, I've been to three different Kinka Izakaya locations, in my experience it is similar to DonDon but overall a little better in almost every aspect. However, it's hard to beat DonDon's location in the heart of downtown.

*Review written on my fourth time here, two people, Friday night dinner time, seated at the bar, ordered 7-8 different dishes. Two drinks. Roughly a hundred dollar bill pre tips."}
{"text":"The service took forever and we waited an hour for a single dish. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun! The staff are always high energy and enthusiastic when welcoming the new guest who come in. My party had booked out a party room for our night. It was tucked way in corner and we didn't get too much noise interference from the other guest. 

Of all the things you must get, karaaga chicken! Perfectly deep fried pieces of chicken thigh with japanese mayo. So delicious we kept ordering it! Now a true japanese party experience wouldn't be complete without Sake Bombs! For those who don't know about it, you take an 8 ounce glass and fill it with beer then place chop sticks on top of the beer then a shot of sake on top of the chop sticks. The challenge is to bang on the table to make the sake fall into the beer and drink it all in one go! Its so much fun and an absolute must do for new people!

Forewarning! You need to book a reservation ahead of time! This place fills up quickly which means you could be waiting for hours for a table. There is a bit of a language barrier since most of the staff speak english as a second language so be patient with them."}
{"text":"Was excited to check out but quite disappointed at the end of night. Cute place for date or hang out with friends but wont go there if I have a choice. There are better place around the neighbour."}
{"text":"The environment is on the louder end, and it's set up as a place to eat snacks or a small meal and enjoy some drinks. Food portions tend to be on the smaller end, unless you're ordering something like a hot pot to split between two people. There's plenty of sake and other beers to choose from. Their kitchen is semi-open, so some of that greasy smell does make its way to tables and your clothes. Meals do end up somewhat pricey especially with drinks and various small plates put together. Service is great and staff are all super friendly, helpful, and take their time to explain the different drinks and food items to you."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Jan 03, 2016 and I can not wait to go back. Thankfully I went with a friend from Japan and she was able to help describe the different items for us when ordering. My three favourites were the miso soup, baked Tofu & Yam and of course the overflowing glass of sake!! There were many other nummy things as we filled our table trying as much as possible. 
The staff was attentive, efficient and energetic. Don't be surprised when you hear them all welcome new guests at the sound of the drum in the centre of the dining area. The atmosphere and decor is a nice change from all the metro-lounges and big box restaurants in the area. 
I continue to try to gather friends for my next trip back to don don's.
Hope your experience is as good as mine was."}
{"text":"For an izakaya, the food is good. Been here 15+ times. Delicious lunchtime don buri. And the drink specials are not to be beat. If you go here to order sushi you don't know what you're missing, it's all about the don buri! Add that the atmosphere is fairly authentic, and you've got a cool secret on Dundas in the heart of downtown. Best to take a group of people with you to get the full experience of sitting at their traditional tables."}
{"text":"Was excited about trying this place and wanting to love it.  I've been crazy about Izakayas since trying Guu, and with DonDon taking reservations I wanted this to be my go-to Izakaya...but unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be.  

The food was just a bit off.  The dishes we ordered (we had about 15 dishes) all looked amazing and really appetizing but my eyes were taunting me because as soon as I tasted the food it was either too salty, too bland or too sweet.  

Overall this place fell way short of my expectations - I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Similar to the kinkas, this is a bit more livelier (well maybe b/c it was midnight and the crowd was rowdier).  The service is pretty fast - you get seated, get menus and get your order taken fast.  This may have been of course because they close at 1am.  ON THE DOT.  How do we know that?  Because they came around like 5 times to tell us that they close at 1am.  

We ordered a bottle of sake to share (worked out cheaper) and a bunch of dishes to share - fried rice with okra; fried ginger chicken, beef tataki, torched mackerel sushi and tuna sashimi.  Everything was delicious - if we had more time I think we would have ordered more, but it hit the spot at midnight when you want a nighttime snack.

The décor is fun, the vibe loud (izakaya afterall) and the food good.  I'd definitely come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A mixed bag.  Food is tapas style Japanese inspired bar snacks and you need to order a few different things if you want a full meal.  Some of the items are fantastic - like a hay smoked salmon and others are deep fried and tasteless.  The atmosphere can be fun when it is busy.  If you have a large group there are private rooms at the back with low tables.  Wait staff tends to get confused and overwhelmed, so not a place to go if you are in any sort of hurry."}
{"text":"I came to Dondon for the very first time after walking by numerous times. I ordered a variety of items I typically order at izakaya such as takowasabi, ebimayo, and sashimi. In addition, I ordered sushi and this rayu udon. Most of the items were great. I didn't think the sashimi was that tasty though. 

The rayu udon was the most disappointing item for me. The picture looked like it was some crazy udon but it was actually some spicy udon. The udon came out with a spicy sauce/oil in the bottom to stir. It didn't feel like it went well with udon noodles. I prefer spicy sauce with thinner noodles and with more absorbency. I felt that the spicy sauce was too slippery on the udon noodles. 

The service was great. Staff are friendly and enthusiastic always. The food came out fast although it was really busy.

In terms of food, it was good but nothing stood out to make me return if I wasn't in the area. I prefer other izakaya restaurants. However , Dondon is a good choice if you are nearby. It is in a good location so I can see why it is really crowded."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun dinner with amazing food would highly recommend DonDon! 

From entering the restaurant you feel like you've left Toronto. The atmosphere is lively! They have drinking games and a large selection of food! 

I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I came to Don Don Izakaya with my boyfriend for lunch on a weekday.
Service was excellent - they offer a lunch special which comes as a set meal.
We both ordered the GRILLED MACKEREL lunch set. We were going to order an appetizer with it but the waiter was so honest and told us that our lunch portion is more than enough. And he's right! We appreciate your tidbit!! :D

GRILLED MACKEREL lunch set (4/5)
It came with a huge bowl of rice, gyoza, 3 different dishes of veggies, miso soup and salad. The portions were huge and worth the price of the lunch set! The grilled mackerel was delicious. 

We will revisit for lunch another time :)"}
{"text":"Would never come back or recommend this place to anyone. Came here on a Saturday night (around midnight) - restaurant was busy but there were some empty tables. 
We were sat as soon as we walked in, handed menus and then never visited by a server again. We sat there waiting to place our drink and food orders for over 25 minutes, not a single server looked in our direction and we couldn't \"wave\" anyone down because they were either looking straight ahead or walking by very quickly. 

Guess the business didn't care for our business ...since the entire place seemed to be serviced except for us.

Walked straight out and glad we did."}
{"text":"Don't usually write yelp reviews, but I felt I had to warn people about the terrible service at this place!! It took over 45 mins to get some torched salmon and mackeral. I asked multiple times and all they told me was that the kitchen was busy. They did not start making the food until I went up to the kitchen and asked the chefs why the food was taking so long. The rest of our table (of 9) had already recieved their food. The food in general was mediocre but overpriced considering their small portions, and their service was not the best."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It reminded me of a Japanese bar in Japan! 

It's upstairs. When you walk in, they bang a gong to alert people of your entrance. There's a couple of different seating areas. You can sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook, have a table off the bar or have a Japanese style booth where you sit on the ground. This Is good for groups or bday parties, but I would call in advance to reserve seating.

There's different types of food you can order. The most unique thing we had was squid guts. The waiter suggested to eat it with rice. I agree! It's not so good on its on in my opinion. The fried food was crispy and good. $5 sapporo beer on Fridays! 

I will return!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The atmosphere was fun without being too distracting.  They have an impressive sake menu that I really enjoyed and the food was delicious too."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this place last night. The physical place is cool: pretty decoration, good atmosphere. However, service is terrible. 
They took forever to serve us and to bring the stuff to the table. The orders were confused 2 times, and one of the dishes was never brought. When we got the bill (without even asking for it!!!), they had charged us for the missing item and when we reminded them about it, instead of bringing it, they just took it out the bill and pretty much kicked us out (it was 11:45 and they close at 1am on Saturdays). 
When they brought us the famous sake bombs, they completely missed all the fun of it, just brought them, explained how they were supposed to be drank and left, not without spilling my friend's drink in the table first. 
In conclusion, I do not recommend this place. There are much better Izakayas in town."}
{"text":"maybe I'm just not the izakaya type... coming here to DonDon izakaya and even Guu... My tastes are probably more attuned to the pedestrian \"North American\" version of Japanese food.
Went to DonDon with a party of roughly 20 individuals for a Friday Birthday dinner. For some reason they must not number their seats when they do orders because every time an order came in, we had to yell out the order and the person that ordered would have to raise their hand. Maybe it's part of the bar experience but since the place is loud, sometimes the person that ordered didn't hear it and someone would take theirs or we'd send it back.
Then there was the whole forgetting someone else's order which kind of sucked.
Another issue I may also have had is that they said they couldn't split the bill more than 2x... Maybe it's a way to ensure their severs aren't running around with multiple terminals but 2 seems a bit low, but hey maybe again it's part of the experience.

There were a few party rooms in the back that were sit down, that seemed a bit fun... If not awkward sitting cross legged for that long. 

The prices id say were slightly more affordable than Guu. 

If you want to enjoy a variety of Japanese inspired and Japanese alcoholic beverage they seemed to have a good menu... A friend ordered plum wine (bonus points for the actual plum) the grapefruit vodka came with a half of grapefruit and a metal juicer lol. At least you know the juice is fresh?

Good place to hang out overall and a lot cheaper than going to Japan as the restaurant said"}
{"text":"Love this place for what it is: an extremely fun place with good food and good drinks to enjoy with friends. The atmosphere and ambience is great and what one would expect for an izakaya. The food is delicious too, with a good variety. 

If you're looking to have a fun and casual meal I highly recommend DonDons!"}
{"text":"Don Don is a hit or miss for some people. My friend and I spent around $50 when we were there and had around 4-5 dishes with sake. They also had daily specials, but a lot of them were sold out by the time we were there (around 8pm, which was really disappointing).

Atmosphere: 
Nice decor and looked a lot like Guu. I like that they had the drum - adds a nice touch. If you are there with a friend, I would consider sitting by the bar. You can see the chefs cook and prep the food; an added bonus is them serving you once the food is ready. They also had a lot of party rooms/tables to accommodate larger parties. One thing I found odd/off putting was the smell of bleach when I walked and sat down at the bar. Perhaps they just cleaned the area?!

Food:
Not Recommended - Deep Fried Pork Belly & Takoyaki Pizza.
- The deep fried pork belly was all tempura batter. You couldn't even see the pork belly!! Not worth the price.
- Takoyaki Pizza looked like it was a dish of meat balls, pretty neat! BUT, it was covered in tomato sauce and cheese which made the takoyaki really soggy. The tomato sauce was also pretty bitter and did not pair well with the takoyaki.

Recommended - Sake Flight, Torched Mackerel, Smoky Hay Sashimi
- The sake flight gave you a nice sample of 3 different sakes. Great for people who can't decide on what to try. You get a taste of light to strong sake. Two of them tasted like fruit juice to me! Don Don also has a pretty extensive sake menu.
- The torched mackerel was amazing! Since we sat at the bar, the waiter was able to torch the pieces of mackerel right in front of us. The dish came with some ground daikon and onions to pair with the fish.
- Smoky Hay Sashimi (BC Tuna) was another great dish. You can really taste the smoky flavours in each bite. You are instructed to dip the fish in to some salt, top it off with a piece of garlic and onion.

Service:
The service could have been better, I had to constantly ask for water refills and for the bill a few times. They missed one of our orders, but promptly put the order in for us again. They did a great job explaining the dishes and how to eat it properly.

All in all, would come back if there is a huge wait time at Guu."}
{"text":"If you have a large group, I suggest making reservations ahead of time. We had a party of 6-7, made reservations on a Friday around 6:30, got there seeing lots of people waiting for a table. I was worried we weren't going to get a table even with reservations but they kept their word and voila we had a table! Didn't have to share with anybody and there was a coat rack right next to us. 

We ended up ordering a bowl of noodles for each of us (ramen, seafood noodles) and each of us chose an appetizer ranging from croquette (we thought it was interesting because it was literally all black), skewers (terriyaki flavour is too salty for my liking), different types of blowtorch sushi, deep fried oysters (comes with 5; we asked if we could have 6 and they said no so that was disappointing) and the omelette. Altogether it turned out to be $25 per person (we just divided up the bill by 6 to make life easier. 10% discount if you pay with cash. 

The environment of this place is pretty cool. A little noisy but not as noisy as guu (another Izakaya place I'm sure it gets compared to a lot). When somebody enters they bang the drum and cheer and vice versa when they leave. I don't know where they get their energy from but it sets a positive atmosphere. This restaurant is located on the second floor and it's one of the spacier Izakaya places I've been to which I like."}
{"text":"So, you want to go to an Izakaya.  Cool.  And you've had a hard day at work and don't feel like the 120 decibels of Guu, well give DonDon a try.

The ATMOSPHERE: Traditional-ish looking izakaya.  Real Japanese waitstaff.  Gangsta rap on the speakers.  Drunken asian college students.  

FOOD:  Stop, and order the BEEF TATAKI.  I put it in capital letters because it's that good, and at $6.50, maybe you should just order two.  The rest of the food menu has been a bit hit and miss.  The sushi chirashi ($8.50) was a miss, as the main component was butterfish, and some of the salmon had bones, although the rice was nicely flavoured.  The chicken teriyaki burger ($6.5) was very fresh and tasty, but quite small in portion size.  

DRINKS:  Pricey!  $8.40 for what they call a \"pint\" of Asahi Super Dry.  Dear DonDon, 14 ounces is in fact only 70% of a pint.  Sake has insane markups for anything you'd want to drink.  

SERVICE: Friendly, but you're going to have to practice your best waitress-flagging techniques.  Empty plates and glasses will be your fate otherwise.  

OVERALL, kind of a fun vibe.  Everyone seems to be happy.  Food is pretty average, and drinks are pretty pricey.  And much, much quieter than Guu."}
{"text":"Nothing like a cold beer after a hot yoga class (Yogatree is across the street)... order the Polar Beer or a nice pitcher of Sapporo! The food is pretty basic so maybe a second drink or pitcher is a good call. It's a fun space to go with friends and probably not best for a hot date. But after a pitcher or two, who cares."}
{"text":"Waitresses kept ignoring us. When we finally ordered, our server didn't know what the squid items on the special menu were lol. Food was also mediocre. Will not be returning. Skip this place, go to Guu Izakaya instead."}
{"text":"Uh. What is this place?
I heard mixed reviews of this place.  Some people LOVE this place, and some people HATE this place.  Unfortunately, I'm part of the latter group.

Although the decor was nice with the sake barrels and all, but 1) it was annoying as they would always hit the freakin' Japanese drum whenever a person entered; and 2) the food was highly disappointing.  I can't recall what I had, but I think almost every single thing that we had was disappointing.

Just go to Guu, if you're craving Japanese izakya food."}
{"text":"The food here was decent but the customer service wasn't that good. I ordered the tako wasabi and it was extremely chewy I barely could eat it. I had to spit it out. I asked for the item to be returned to the kitchen because it was not edible, to which the waiters were very confused. We got the bill and they had not removed the charge for the item. I addressed this with the waiter and thier response was \"we talked to the kitchen and it's always like that\". I don't think chewy food that needs to be spit out should be \"normal\". But ok, I paid the bill but will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I found my Toronto version of Yo Taisho. Colorful menu, reasonable prices, grilled stuff, noodles, shochu and beer. It's loud, informal and basically the way it should be. Some hits, some misses, but more hits than misses. Hits: ginger fried chicken, hay smoked sashimi, tako wasabi, tuna carpaccio, green tea mousse. 

Good for: drinking and eating and drinking some more."}
{"text":"This is a really chill spot!! 

Honestly, I didn't know what I was walking into. It was just a random place to eat.. As soon as we went upstairs and walked into this joint, I was hearing some prime HipHop like WTF?? Did not expect it at all - YUPPIE crowd  - Love the deco!! Traditional meets contemporary -  Dim lighting - Coat rack on the walls available (it's only worth mentioning because it was raining out tonight)  The food was good for sharing, I highly recommend the fried ginger chicken AKA \"Karaage\", I don't typically like fried foods much but it was really good, the lemon tone was subtle and just right. The okra fried rice was awesome it was rather complementary to the chicken actually (if you don't like spicy, it's not for you) The beef tataki & torched mackerel sushi get an honourable mention.  BC tuna sashimi was on point but if you're not a fan of raw fish, I suppose it's pretty much gonna suck anywhere. I've had better but it was fresh so no complaints, also, they have a wide selection of Sake so you won't be disappointed. I can't remember the name of the one we had but on the Nihonshu-do it's a -1 and served hot. There's a speakeasy, called Suite 114. Located at 116 Dundas if you want to grab a drink afterwards. The log cabin is kinda like a Manhattan, but not as stiff.. (there's a dirty joke somewhere there) the sweet cherries are so rich and flavoured, I thought it balanced the drink exceptionally  well.   

Hope you enjoyed this review, 
(it's my first one) 
Cheers"}
{"text":"I really like don don because they have decent atmosphere and they open late! So every time when I want to have a late night snack I will definitely go there. The food are not the best but I like that they have a lot of options. I will continue to go there despite all the bad reviews :)"}
{"text":"Shareable food and drinks. The location is great, it's right at Yonge and Dundas. 

That's about it for the good things. 

Service is by far the worst part. They throw dishes in your face and grunt something in English, or Japanese? They bring other people's food to your table. They will call you one hour before your reservation to tell you that you have to leave by a certain time. They will also call you past 23:00 on another day to tell you that they don't have seats, so  to come two hours before your reservation time... And on the day, the servers will tell you that your party can stay until a certain time. Nuh-uh. Not happening on my clock. This place is a mess. 

The menu needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Asked for water 3 times, even though there wasn't a lot of people to begin with. The dessert we got tasted rotten and sour, server came to apologize but didn't sound sincere at all. For the food some was ok some was below standard but over all it's overpriced. There is this one dish called back croquette that looks kind of like three dark charcoal sticks and in the description it says shrimp and mayo. Even tho it tasted nice, from the three sticks we got there was only one small piece of shrimp out of the three and it was charged as I believe around $7. Forcing you to give 15% tips without informing, I would've given extra tips while using my card to pay. Normally if a restaurant is meh I wouldn't complain or leave bad comments, but this time it's so ridiculous I had to do something."}
{"text":"DonDon Izakaya has a lot of potential, but they lack in efficient service.  The staff were really nice, but really slow and our waitress was really confused.

Other than that, the food was decent and the décor was inviting.  Unfortunately, Guu is definitely better in terms of food and service.  However, DonDon is a lot more affordable and easier to get seated."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out Don Don Izakaya for a while now and recently I finally did. 

My friend and I were actually craving for ramen that day, but Sensotei lineup was too long so we decided to come here instead. Well...lets just say we made a huge mistake. My ramen tasted like it was made from instant noodle. The noodle was pretty hard and the soup was really salted and did taste like it was from soup mix. Oh and not enough meats, but not as worse as the seafood udon that my friend got, which literally had couple clamp and that was it. Both of the noodle bowls were bad and not worth the $11.80 each price tag. 

I do give points for the ambience of the restaurant however. The renovation was amazing, it really made the restaurant feel like it's in a bamboo hut. It gives and warm and cozy feel.

We didn't try the other foods, so maybe we didn't get to experience what makes this restaurant special, but just from what we got that day, I wouldnt say the food was good. I may come back for another try with a friend who's more experienced with ordering here."}
{"text":"Good service, we choose to sit by the bar, the waitress was always around, so they served whatever we needed... Food is unique, the soy milk tofu is a must-try, with sweet mixed little creamy taste, it is more like desert rather than starter.. 
Green tea mouse with red bean is very delicious, it taste more like green tea pudding, not too sweet and combines perfectly with red bean"}
{"text":"Waited for over 30 minutes and had been totally forgot. The waiters asked us to wait in the stairway but no one ever came to serve us. Even the customers came later than us got inside while we were still waiting. The WORST dining experience I've ever had in Toronto!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A Twitter friend suggested we meet up here. I loved the vibe- relaxed, zero pretension. It reminded me of my trip to Japan when I was 14. Old school, authentic, no fuss. I got the Vegetable Croquettes, which tasted a lot like the potato croquettes I ate in Japan, and the ginger fried chicken. This was Japanese food as I remembered it. Not especially mind blowing. Just simple. Filling. Good. Real."}
{"text":"We came in, late on a Friday evening (myself and 5 friends). They luckily secured us seating as we were heading over from the Financial District.

Overall it was a positive experience - the food was good, the beer was good, and we got to seat in their back party areas (shoes off, tatami mat style) which was great and made for a more private experience where we could be as goofy as we wanted.

Ambiance = Great
Food = Good
Price = Reasonable

Out of all the dishes we ordered, the Ginger Fried Chicken stood out best. Close seconds would be the Smoky Hay Sashimi and the Stir-Fried Seafood Noodles. 

Truly this place needs to be taken for what it is, in spirit of an Izakaya - a nice casual spot to have drinks and nibble on food. I wouldn't expect the food to stand out as world-class masterpieces.

Total food list:
- Ginger Fried Chicken
- Smoky Hay Sashimi
- Spicy Grilled Squid
- Hoppeta-Yaki
- Tokyo-Style Hot Dog - Teriyaki
- Chirashi
- Stir-Fried Seafood Noodle
- Pork Kimchi Udon
- Shrimp Mayo
- Quail Skewers"}
{"text":"DonDon is located walking distance from Yonge and Dundas. A great location! 

I decided to try this Izakaya after reading mixed reviews, I do agree this is a hit or miss with the dishes. The prices are fair and comparable to other Japanese restaurants. 

Ordered the following:
* Pork Kimchi Udon (9.50$)
* Duck and Apple Salad (8.90$)
* Pickled Fish and Veggies (6.50$)
* Smoky Hay Sashimi (Salmon) (12.50$)
* Bamboo Squid (7.80$)
* Fwat Fwat Pork (9.00$)
* Today's Chirashi Rice (8.50$)

The most amazing dish was the Pork Kimchi Udon it had the best flavour combination. The pork was tender and moist - not dry at all. I wanted to order another plate of this - it's perfect for sharing between two or for one because it's just that good. 

The Fwat Fwat Pork was not impressive - the pork was dry and lacked flavour. There was too much sauce and lacked depth in a dish that could be amazing. 

Pickled Fish and Veggies had weird texture - most of the veggies were onions and a couple of carrots. I would not recommend this at all! 

Smoky Hay Sashimi (Salmon), I thought this was an interesting concept so I tried it out and how much do I regret this? It was just a strange taste and would have opted for the Sashimi Platter. 

Duck and Apple Salad was a good portion, definitely shareable and tasted OK. Nothing impressive but the duck was perfectly cooked and had good texture. I do prefer the salads at Fin Izakaya a lot more though, since they have options of choosing which dressing. 

Overall, the restaurant was clean and service was super friendly and enthusiastic. The food was 3/5 stars due to the hit and miss of the dishes. I wouldn't mind coming back for that Udon though when in the area though. I do recommend making reservations as it gets busy during dinner hours. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! The chefs are constantly making a spectacle with open flames and drums being banged. The tappas and Saki selection is incredibly unique, I haven't experienced anything quite like it!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice, I got the tonkatsu ramen the first time and the butter soy ramen during my second visit. The flavor of the butter soy is definitely more fragrant than the tonkatsu. But the meat and egg were both a bit overcooked IMO (particularly the meat). I definitely enjoyed the pork in the tonkatsu, super tender and fatty aha. I also like how the egg is a bit sweet so it balances out the rest of the ramen which is savoury. The ramen is pretty salty. 

Other thing to note is that they apparently don't split the bill? During my second visit we came in a group of six and we were told that they don't split it. Last time I came with one other friend and they did it for us so...But ya the environment is pretty good. They also welcome customers who come in and bang this traditional drum. But idk I think there are better places to go to, might come back to try something else. My friends had the kimchi udon and fried chicken. Fried chicken might be a hit or miss because they did overfry one of my friends'."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, wide selection but mediocre food makes Don Don Izakaya pretty low on my list.

Located on Dundas near Bay Street, Don Don is in quite a prime location. Coming in late on a Thursday night, it was a relatively full restaurant but we didn't have to wait for seating. We ordered a number of dishes: 

Fried pork belly - this was not very good, i couldn't even taste the meat and it was like eating fried dough. There was also a bit too much sauce on it.
Fried chicken - this was average fried chicken to me
Tako wasabi - great, but I feel like it's a bit hard to screw this one up
Beef rice - bland and boring

There was an awesome beer special $10 for a pitcher of Sapporo!

I probably won't be coming back, but if you've exhausted the better Izakaya's in the city, give this a try."}
{"text":"So I'm a bit biased when it comes to izakaya's because I haven't gone to one that I don't like.. :)

Faves!
-Spicy grilled squid - not really spicy but grilled well, A+  
- Hoppeta -Yaki .. honestly still don't really know what it is (I think it was chicken?) Only ordered it because the picture on the menu looked cool... tasted great though :P
- All of their skewers were delicious.  The meats were tender and flavoured so well, don't know what kind of seasoning they use but they should keep using it
- Pork kimchi udon - can't really go wrong with kimichi and pork but could be a bit more spicy!

The usual complaints about Don Don, which goes for all izakayas.. are the higher pricing & small portions. When I visited, we ordered about 8-10 dishes with drinks for four guys and a girl. Everyone was pretty full after and it came to $50 per person, definitely on the pricier side still
 
Comparable to Guu, less lively atmosphere but food on the same scale :)"}
{"text":"it's a Japanese style bar so...it's supposed to be a place you can sit and chat for a while... it's not the case, once you finished they ASK YOU TO LEAVE. 

The food is great... one or two special dishes. Since it's suppose to be a Japanese style bar, make sure to research what you might like and try their alcohol.

No compare to the traditional style of Japanese bar that's warm and welcoming, DonDon have fast food type service, they don't welcome you to stay for drinks. You need to quickly finish your meal and leave. If you want to chat with your friends with a few drinks and enjoy the night, i suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ahhhh don don, guu's little brother with fewer variety and downgrade quality. The only reason we can here was because guu was an hour and half wait and we were starving. There is no line here at all. The decor and environment is verys similar to guu with screaming chefs and waitresses and a sort of batman cave atmosphere. They sat us right behind a drum and everytime someone comes in, they pound the shit out of that drum...I can barely hear after leaving this place. Their speciality is this black rice roll which was delicious!!!! other than that, everything else was mediocore. My last time coming to this place. Only guu from now on."}
{"text":"Solid, authentic izakaya! This place just opened 3 weeks ago, but the server informed me that they are waiting a couple more weeks before their *grand* opening. Stay tuned!

Tried this place out with a group of friends tonight and had a great time. This place is gonna give Guu a run for its money for sure! 

In brief:
- Huge space on 2nd floor with some small party rooms and tatami rooms (complete with slippers to use when you go to the washroom)
- When you arrive, you will be greeted not only by staff shouting \"irashaimase\" but also a taiko drum!
- Menu is easy to navigate with pictures of all the dishes
- Highlights -- black croquette with potato, shrimp, cod row and squid ink; cheese wontons; skewer platter
- The kimchi hot dog was interesting and spicy
- The only disappointment with the chocolate and strawberry risotto... Just an odd combination and the chocolate was that artificial syrup-y stuff 
- Great selection of cocktails. I had the yuzu calpico sour. Yummy!
- Very friendly and polite servers

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and decor but the food was forgettable. There's better options for izakaya. Try kinka (guu) or kingyo."}
{"text":"Very fun experience! Really cool decor and cozy. I like how there is a good variety of small dishes and the food is delicious. On Sundays they have 4 dollar pints of sopporo. My one advice would be not to get the pint of sopporo with ice froth because ur paying an extra 4 dollars for ice froth which isn't worth it. Other than that service is amazing and everyone is extremely polite and welcoming! Loved the vibe and will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Back at DonDon which is the sound of the drums they bang on when you enter. This is their tradition since they opened five years ago. The décor is still the same except the bar is now open and the drum has moved further down.
The food is fine. Their lunch menu is larger than most other places and gives one choices. Their emphasis is on sets, which come with a gyoza, salad, soup and vinegared and pickled vegetables. The chriashi rice set for $15 was nice and the rice was flavourful.
The waitress was a bubbly Kyoto girl and quite friendly. Water was refilled, drinks delivered and explanations were forthcoming. We were happy that it was lunchtime and they were not busy.
Suggestions to make Dondon even better: do not innovate. No one wants innovation. Deliver Japanese meals with Japanese recipes. That is it.
Change the music from the Western hits crap to Japanese music to give more of a Japanese vibe and ambiance.
Add more individual tables to replace the group tables. The communal seating does not work for me (unless I am in a big group)."}
{"text":"This place is really under-rated, I think. Super tasty food, great staff, less noisy than some Izakaya. Huge list of drinks. I say go!"}
{"text":"I've been here way too many times in the past year, especially since people at my work place tend to love going to DonDon for lunch. Call for lunch and dinner cuz it seems like they are pretty busy at both times.

The lunch special is usually pretty value, you choose a set/combo and most of them come with miso and side dishes. For dinner, the price does add up to quite a bit if you're a big eater like me. Most portions are very small, so it's a good idea to go with couple people and share everything. Recommend the kimchi udon!

There are couple other great izakayas in Toronto with signature dishes."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place if you're by yourself. It seems to me that they favour big groups since they might make more money that way. If you go alone you may be ignored with your order having low priority."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I have been plenty of times before but the service gets progressively worse as I go. Drinks are good but expensive. The butter ramen is my only favourite item, although food is expensive for small portions. My friends and I sat in there and it took them over half an hour to take our orders and it wasn't busy. Throughout the night we had to hail the servers down when they walked and only served the closest tables to them. When it came time for the bill, we asked them to split it between us and they couldn't understand what we were saying. When paying, I gave an average 15% tip and our waitress had said in front of us that it wasn't a proper tip. Never will I go back, sorry."}
{"text":"Do not mistaken this place with regular Japanese restaurants, but treat it as a bar. Food here are meant for Sake, not the other way around. If you want to order things from the grill, order it first, because the process is slow and they usually do one order at a time.
Proper Izakayas are not known for variety in food, but variety in Sake, so don't expect there are hundreds of items for you to select from. They have a good selection of Sake, though.
There are reviewers who are annoyed by the drum announcing new customers, get over it, that's what make this place the genuine ethnic touch.
As for the food, it is not the best, but it is good enough that even my picky eating wife want to come back, because there are so much variety we still want to try."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. The food was mediocre, the music was awful, the service wasn't great, and my coat that service hung up for me was pick pocketed. Someone stole all my change, which was about $10. Thank goodness I had removed my phone from my pocket!

We had the fried seaweed which was pretty good, the spicy prawns which were okay but too salty, and the deep fried makerel which was very fishy yet bland. 

The best thing about the place was the beer and the company. We won't be going again."}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch, but my co-worker wanted some happy hour drinks so we picked DonDon. Their kitchen doesn't open back up until 5pm, and we did arrive at 4:30. I ordered the don don special drink ($4), which was sake & lychee poured into a glass. From what I learned that day, the tradition in japan is that they pour the alcohol and overflows the cup onto a plate that is placed underneath. You are then able to drink the glass and the remains left on the plate. My coworker ordered a beer and we later ordered beef tataki, shrimp mayo, kiragi (fried chicken), and kimichi hot dog. Since it is an Izakaya, the portions are appetizer size. The shrimp mayo had batter that was crispy and it was delicious. The kiragi was deep fried and very crispy, which came along with a tasty dip. The kimichi hot dog was meh, there was nothing special about that dish. 

Overall, I enjoy their lunch menu a lot more then their night time menu. The portion size and value is a lot better."}
{"text":"If I could I would give it negative stars. When I walked in I had a pretty good impression, looks pretty high class. Was seated right away at the bar which was pretty cool. When me and my girlfriend went to order we were served by a server that could barely understand English and had no idea what we were ordering. Keep in mind we didn't order off the menu and we even pointed to her in the menu to the pictures of what we wanted to order. 

I ended up having a sashimi platter (5 different kinds of fish), takoyaki pizza (takoyaki balls with tomato paste and cheese ontop), and a variety of 5 pieces deep fried vegetables and meat skewer set (pork, shrimp, cheese, onion, beef). My girlfriend had a teriyaki tofu salad (mixed greens with teriyaki sauce and tofu) and a steamed shabu shabu(thin pork slices with zucchini, cabbage, onions and enoki mushrooms). 

Shortly after we ordered, my sashimi set arrived, presentation was nice and the taste was decent since this isn't a restaurant that specializes in sushi and sashimi. But after the sashimi set, it all went down from there. Waited about 30 mins for my takoyaki pizza and it was legit mediocre. The balls only had 1 little piece of octopus inside it and it was still slimy like it was under cooked. Even after finishing my takoyaki pizza, my girlfriends dishes still haven't came out yet. I work in the restaurant industry myself so I don't usually complain about food coming out slow because there are many factors to it but I just had to do it because it was really unacceptable. I talked to a manager and he said her steamed shabu shabu was \"over cooked\" and her salad is coming out right now. Her salad was compelled of a few mixed green leafs tossed in teriyaki sauce and a bunch of small fried tofu cubes surrounding the dish. After finishing her salad her steamed shabu shabu came. To charge someone $9.2 for 4 slices of thinly sliced pork, 2 halves of a zucchini, 1 small bunch of enoki mushrooms and the rest cabbage is ridiculous. Keep in mind during all this time it's been about an hour and I still haven't received my last dish yet, the skewer set. I tried to get the attention of the manager but he was busy so I just went and got my server who couldn't speak English. She went and talked to the chef and then started pointing at me and my girlfriend and I felt offended. The chef was nice enough to walk over and tell me it will come out in 2 mins (meaning she probably forgot to punch in the order). The skewer set wasn't anything special, it's exactly what you would expect. Deep fried of whatever it is said on the menu. They give you a Japanese BBQ dipping sauce to go with it but it tasted horrible in my opinion. 

By the time we got our bills and paid I was pretty furious and disappointed about the whole experience seeing how Toronto is one of the best city's in the world and the location of this restaurant is just a quick walking distance from young and dundas square. 

After I paid and left I was still hungry so I went to the McDonald's on atrium on Bay and got takeout. Now I normally wouldn't mention about McDonald's but what surprised me the most was that the whole 5 minutes experience I got at the McDonald's was better than what I got at don don. 

I'll probably never step foot back into don don again."}
{"text":"I have to confess I am a little late writing this review since I came here twice in January 2014. The first time with one girlfriend for an early birthday dinner celebration, and the second time with a group of girlfriends with a post-birthday celebration (since I loved it so much).

I don't absolutely recall everything I had but I loved it so much I ended up going again with another group of friends for a second birthday dinner (yes my girlfriends spoil me, what can I say). So by now I have tried most items on their menu but I can tell you the best were:

-Smoky Hot Sashimi - Salmon (addicted to this I ordered several plates of this)
-Fwhat-fwhat pork (pork belly, ginger, steamed buns and hoisin sauce)
-Spicy Okra shrimp
-5 skewer combo (chicken, beef, pork with green onion, asparagus & bacon,king oyster with mushroom and bacon) 
-Ginger Fried chicken
-Shrimp mayo

To drink I did try 4-5 different Sake's but the most memorable ones were:
-Tozai Snow Maiden Junmai Nigori - 15.0% and creamy - like nothing you've had before.
-Nanbu Bijin Ginjo -16.0% - nice and clean!

Anyway, I am definitely overdue on a visit - I love coming here - the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is great! I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"an alright izakaya. interior is cool, loved the big gong.
drink menu is impressive and reasonable. however the food isn't amazing."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to come back here but I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.

I was here for my birthday. The food was amazing. Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures because I was busy celebrating my birthday. 

They have the sake tasting and we tried 3 different sakes, from light to heavy. Oh I had my sake bomb as I wished.
This place is super comfortable, and the price is not too expensive. The servers are nice. They are very sweet!

One of my friends wanted to surprise me so he secretly told the manager about my birthday. So just right before I asked for the bill, they announced my birthday and gave me an energetic drum roll ( I was like heck is happening lol) Then they brought me a plate with a scoop of ice cream of nice drawing, stood at my table and slapped and sang for me. Super super sweet! Even sweeter than my ice cream!

I love DonDon!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch is no good here. I waited 30 minutes for my food. I got the don curry lunch set. Their fried shrimp, chicken and pork are all frozen and bought from packets that look like what you buy from T and T. 

For lunch the service is too slow. 

There are better lunch options for cheaper prices."}
{"text":"It is a good bar for hanging out with friends and the occasional drinking. I love their Japanese inspired alcohol, they're very authentic.  Can be a bit pricy if you \"try\" a lot of things as they'll use in their rhetoric and on their menu lol.  The only thing I would dock them off for is the slow response time, but it was reasonable, considering the place was packed.  Other than that,  I would recommend this place without a doubt."}
{"text":"it must be annoying to be constantly compared to guu, but yes, the food isn't as good. not bad, but not as good. however, i certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go to guu instead of dondon. actually, i like the décor more than guu's. 

service is friendly, but like many have said, inconsistent. 

the beer and sake are excellent. it's a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"We had heard how fabulous GUU was and had been meaning to try it out...when Don Don opened across the street from us we were thrilled. We were a group of 4 adults and a baby and we went during their opening week. 

Atmosphere and decor was fab, as is the service. The food sadly left much to be desired. The wasabi seaweed chips and salted edamame were the best. Simple but with great flavour. The hotdogs which we heard so much about were nothing special, the simple rice and beef dishes were okay but again nothing to write home about. They had some fish dishes that were fresh but again nothing extra ordinary. Potato wedges took over forty five mins to come out (despite us asking the waitress three times for it) and when it did...well they were plain wedges..don't expect too much. The chicken skewers were grilled over high flame and were decent but pretty tame on the flavours. The chocolate and strawberry rice dessert was absolutely weird..and not in a good way. Every dish was presented beautifully but overall the flavours were lacking. 

I'm not sure if our expectations were too high..in all honesty if we got similar food from say a small no name hole in the wall, we would have been satisfied. However entering a much hyped up restaurant with great detail paid to the decor, wait staff (neat ipad payment and ordering system!) we were expecting to be wowed and we were not. Sadly. Overall bill wasn't bad at all - about ten dishes and two pitchers of beer came up to $160."}
{"text":"who doesn't love this place  
like seriously the servers are super sweet and energetic, the food is good and a great booze collection! what more can you ask for?? They even have hotpot!"}
{"text":"Very unique menu, was PACKED on a Friday night. Great atmopshere just like most izakayas.  I wouldn't order the onion on a skewer, but their fried chicken and takoyaki pizza are epic."}
{"text":"What I tried: 1. Dondon style pork miso soup 2. Don don special croquette 3. Otafuku Omelette 4. Torched sushi - Salmon 5. Pork rice

1. Do not expect a clean and mild Japanese miso soup. It is thicker and stronger. Tastes more Chinese.

2.  Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I liked it.

3. Don't mistake it for okonomiyaki. Its an omelette that tastes like okonomiyaki. Pretty good.

4. Meh. Sushi rice is too vinegary. Badly seasoned.
Fish is okay but who cares if the rice is bad.

5. Pork rice was probably my favorite or on par with the croquette. But pretty average. 

The environment is kinda there but not as loud or rowdy as I thought it would be. The service is extremely slow which I do not expect from an izakaya. The chinese owner came to our table to take our order after like 15-20 min and then as soon as we were about to talk to him, he started talking to his friends who just came in. Um what? 

Average food, slow service, mediocre atmosphere. Skip."}
{"text":"I went recently with a group of colleagues for a work meeting and had the pleasure of being seated in a private area. I had never heard of Izakaya style of food but had looked at the menu ahead of time and was worried. I generally eat no meat so I wasn't seeing too much on the menu for my liking. We were greeted by the not so well understood drum banging and  then seated beyond the communal tables. We got a buzzer to use to request service but we didn't need to use it as we all hummed and hawed over what to order. The drinks came quickly and the first of the food items (seaweed chips) arrived shortly after. The food took a bit of time to arrive at first since it came in staggers but as we all shared the dishes we soon had a full table of food. I really liked the seaweed chips but the best item on the menu that I tried was the okra and shrimp. Though it took forever to arrive to the point we thought they didn't even put the order in, they were worth the wait! 

I would certainly recommend this place for a group of friends looking to go out and try something new. Communal eating (tapas) are always fun."}
{"text":"Overall, this place has pretty good food and quite a fun atmosphere. If you go at dinner. Their lunch menu is limited and fairly boring. 

As for dinner, the best thing we had was the hay smoked sashimi which was really quite tasty. A number of other good things included the black croquette andthe ebi-mayo. 

Good but not outstanding: miso mackerel, Kara-age, taco-wasabi. 

And the one revolting culinary abomination was the tacoyaki pizza. Just a horrid combination. 

Drink menu is really good, but they could have more sake by the glass. 

Fun place to eat with overall good food. A worthwhile place to go"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times I really enjoyed it! (Disclaimer: Guu is of course, better. But if you don't want to wait in a line, this is still pretty good!!)

The first time I went, I had their dinner menu. It's set up like a newspaper with tons of pictures. Everything I had was really good, especially the smoked sashimi (smoked right in front of me!) and their special \"black croquette\". The service is really friendly and attentive - you don't really have one designated server, rather everyone is your server and is happy to clear away dishes and take your order. 

The second time, I was expecting the same menu, but they do have a special lunch-time menu. This includes udon, bento boxes, and sushi/sashimi dishes - basically your typical Japanese menu. EXCEPT: everything is so good and beautifully prepared! 

My sushi ($14.95) was 10 pieces of heaven! They have interesting garnishes which brings out the flavor of the fish - my favorite was the tuna with lemon zest. My date had a bento box, which came in two separate layers (a little different / interesting) and was full of deliciousness. The gyoza and spring rolls looked amazing. 

I definitely recommend trying this place, even if you're looking for a quick sushi lunch."}
{"text":"Despite all the negative reviews here, I actually quite enjoyed DonDon. 

Yes, the portions are smaller than usual, but that's expected of any \"authentic\" Izakaya restaurant. I found the pricing to be alright as well, since each dish was around $7-$20. If you want a full meal, then it would probably be two dishes- still quite affordable. 

My experience with the servers have mostly been positive, though I felt a bit rushed today when the server was taking my order. 

The atmosphere is fun and bustling with life, though the restaurant is rarely fully-seated. 

I highly recommend the following: 
1. Chirashi Rice- fresh sashimi mixed with hot sushi rice
2. Okra Kimchi Fried Rice
3. Pork Kimchi Udon"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, loved everything! The only problem is that I live 2,000 miles away, otherwise I would be back here very soon! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This review is only for their lunch menu. Don Don updated their lunch menu for a few months and I have visited twice so far. They offer wide selctions of set menu: sashimi set, Terayaki chicken/beef/salmon set, Fry Set (pork cutlet, shrimp pawn, fish cake, scalloops). All sets come with side dishes, soup, salad and rice. The side dishes change regularly and they taste pretty good.

First time I had a Fry Set, the portion was very generous. They taste pretty good.

Second time I had a Kaisen Don Set (Seafood Bowl various sashimi), the seafood selections were good and fresh.

They price is very reasonable from $12 to $14.5. Very nice place to hang around with friends and coworkers during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday with my good friend.... It had been close to a year and a half since last visiting DonDon Izakaya.... The first thing I noticed was how quiet the restaurant was.... Previously the restaurant would be jammed with customers, yesterday, not so much.... Server was prompt and courteous... we each ordered the DonDon lunch special, mine with beef, my friend with salmon... Good portions, excellent taste... Cannot figure out why so quiet but still a place I will recommend...."}
{"text":"The food here was alright, but the sub-par service was enough to deter me from wanting to come back. Our group had booked a party room ahead of time (~20 people) and while I understand this can be difficult to deal with, we weren't told two key items.

1. There is an automatic gratuity of 15% for reservations (calculated on TOP of tax). This isn't mentioned during the meal or written anywhere. Apparently they tell you at the time of making the reservation, but as I didn't make the reservation, I can't confirm this.

2. They don't split bills. I repeat, THEY DON'T SPLIT BILLS. AND THEY WON'T TELL YOU THIS. Our group spent well over an hour trying to figure out who owed what on a $600 bill.

We pointed out that this information was never communicated to us and asked if we could at least pay separately after we did the math ourselves. Unfortunately, our server couldn't understand anything we said. Don't come here unless this isn't an issue for you."}
{"text":"Haven't been back for a while, just realized they have a new menu, which is necessary because I stopped coming back for a while when I was tired with the old menu.  

It's still a very nice place for chatting, drinking and munching on delicious small plates.  The smoke fish fire show with the Japanese drum effect offers an unique experience of this restaurant.  I like the vibe and energy of this place.  The bar sitting in front of the smoke fish and yakitori are even better than the table sitting.

Food are not pricy, mostly under $10 per dish.  A whole variety of sake on the menu, from cheap to expensive, it's all your choice.  

Also they have real Japanese chefs and waitresses, they just added to the authenticity of this izakaya.  I highly recommend here for dating or friends gathering.  This place always let me leave with a happy mood.

It will be better if they add in more new dishes more often, that's very important for people to not get tired of a izakaya.  This is why I gave 4 stars to give it room for improvement on menu."}
{"text":"Sorry for the bad rating but I would be doing an injustice to fellow yelpers if I give it a higher rating.

What is good here is like what others are saying is that its quieter and no wait. But really if you are going to an izakaya don't you want it a bit noisy? Anyways I did enjoy the space though but then comes the food.

Honestly the food is O.K. but that is just it... its just OK. Nothing really stood out. I think this place is a little better for vegetarians but really nothing stood out for us. We came here for dinner / a meal not really for drinks so the review would probably be a bit more positive if we came here for drinks.

They did have some specials and deals though. Surprisingly I loved their ramen the most. The soup was a little average but the noodles and the pork belly was amazing. 

We tried quiet a variety totally to $60 for two people but nothing stood out for us. The soy milk tofu was decent and the vegetarian enjoyed that. The service was really good though, so in response to the reviews saying the service was terrible I think they must have improved since they were awesome.

I don't know if I will ever come back but I think they could deserve one more chance."}
{"text":"This place seems to be really hit or miss.  We went as a group of 8 and had a fun time! It was a bit pricey for the food quality, but the atmosphere was really exciting and fun to be in.  They banged this drum every time someone was seated, and it was a pretty loud place in general.  The decoration were interesting too. Kind of pricey, worked out to about $40 per person (we were drinking too).

We got seated in a sort of private-ish booth off to the side, which i guess they use for large groups (we had a reservation), it was nice and cozy.  We felt like we were in our own private area even though we were 10 feet away from the communal tables.

The food was decent, not amazing and not bad.  Some of the dishes were very tasty and seemed like a Japanese/Chinese fusion of some sort, others were very basic and disappointing. 

Overall we had a blast would probably go back, but can't see us becoming regulars."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars

The good: I like their salmon sashimi, it comes with salt and garlic and is my favourite dish there. They have some interesting dishes, and a little selection for everyone. The service is fairly friendly and they greet you when you come in and leave. 

The okay: it can be on the pricier side and all their dishes aren't amazing but are okay. I also ordered the corn with butter, mackerel, udon noodles and fried chicken. 

If you are looking to expand your izakaya experience, it's enjoyable to share dishes with a couple of friends or just a couple of dishes for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good, but now it becomes awful. The price increased and everything is overpriced. The ramen broth is too salty. The salad dressing is too sour. The quality of foods is similar to many all u can eat restaurants but cost is like at least $50 per person before tax. Also the service becomes worse."}
{"text":"Went over with friends for Chinese New Year. It started off on a bad note. A female waitress politely asked us to show our Id the first time. After enquiring about bottle sizes the malr server decided to ask us to show our Ids again and claimed his colleague told him that we weren't checked.

When we got the bill we realized that there was an extra item on the menu which we ordered at the start but wasn't served. Also, one thing about the menu is that you don't see the price tag on it. We asked to split the bill. He looked around at the table, notices that there are 7 of us and asked if we want to split for 10 people. He then proceeds to divide the bill incorrectly.

Food was alright but service was seriously lacking. But don't worry if you're going in a large group because service charge will be on the bill."}
{"text":"4.6 more exactly. 
Just opened in early January 2012, the 3rd of the Izakaya branch in downtown Toronto with the same concept of bar-seating or huge table to share, but also several 6-person table and a huge tatami room for group (to book). As always (and even more because recently open), very nice staff. 

Nice and extended menu (not the usual sushi-sashimi place), with pictures of everything you will want to try. Nice and clean setting. Food is really good and relatively original (and not exactly 100% the same as the Guu-Iza' brother on Church. Prices are correct (but with some very expensive drinks). One or 2 of the food items we tried were slightly overcooked, but overall very good experience. 

Japango, you finally have a concurrent of the same category nearby! bigger and with nicer staff!"}
{"text":"Service was great on a Tuesday night. Portions are good. Restaurant looks really nice. Tried the apple duck salad, takiyaki pizza, bamboo squid, and hoppeta taki.. All of it tasted good with different flavours maybr odd flavours. Overall I think this is a restaurant worth trying."}
{"text":"Good place if you want to have decent Japanese bar foods and still be able to chat with firends without too much noise."}
{"text":"Had a great time eating here, the chefs and waiters were friendly, great vibes and food was not bad too, though a bit pricy.

I would highly recommend the Chicken Karaage, it was by far the most ordered dish throughout the whole night, and definitely a winner in my opinion. It was also one of the few dishes you can count on to fill you up. 

We also ordered tako wasabi (raw octopus seasoned with wasabi) which I also really enjoyed but it was a pretty small portion for it's price. Beware though, the wasabi kicks you right up the nostrils so if you're not one for spice or wasabi, I would advice you against getting it. 

Other dishes we ordered were the Shrimp Croquette, Seafood udon and Mochi balls. Would not recommend the Shrimp Croquette...it looked huge on the menu, but it's tiny! it comes in 3 pieces, each piece is maybe 2 cm by 5cm... Would recommend Seafood udon and Mochi balls :) 

The service was great, waiters were friendly and very attentive, and the chefs were very interactive as well! I would recommend trying to get a bar seat, you can see the chefs in action, and they hand you the food fresh once it's done cooking (so no need to wait for the waiters to bring them to you!) 

Final recommendations: 
there's a $6 dice game that you can play to win drinks. If you like to gamble a bit, it's def fun to play and you can win up to $30 cocktails. However, we played it twice and won a coke..and a tequila shot...so def play at your own risk :P"}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick bite during my buddy's bachelor party and we definitely had a blast. Although food prices are a little on the higher side, the customer service and food quality justifies it. Our server Jackie kept us entertained throughout and even threw in a few sake bombs on the house to congratulate us on the occasion. The kimchi fried rice and curry fries were the highlight of my experience there!"}
{"text":"It was quieter than Guu but in terms of food I preferred Guu more.  It's worth a try as their menus and specials are always changing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the drums. Got the takoyaki - great, fluffy and crisp. The ryu udon on the other hand I had no idea it was going to be spicy. It was basically a bed of plain flavourless udon noodles with chili paste on the top. Would not recommend the ryu udon. On the other hand it's a great place to drink with friends and take some sake shots!"}
{"text":"Went here for a no-frills lunch. Got the sashimi lunch. Sashimi was very fresh and portions were very good! Didnt care much for the soup or salad (typical sushi place fare) and i wished th emenu had had more investive options like a real izakaya...

service was very good...quick...friendly... good location close to my work.

woudl give it 4/5 for a sushi place but i need to downgrade it to 3 stars because it labels itself as an izakaya. other than the drum and the yelling. its just a sushi spot. 

prefer Guu a million times more"}
{"text":"Came around 8 pm on a Tuesday night. The place was nearly half empty, so no wait for a table.

Pro's: fast and friendly service, decent tasting food, more spacious and not as loud as GUU
Con's: way overpriced, decent tasting food, small portions

Verdict: Food quality was OK-good, but definitely not worth the price. For 2 people, $50 before tip (didn't order any drinks), both left hungry. Yes, it is spacious and quieter than GUU, but GUU's food is much better! I can stand the friendly screaming and loud chatter from GUU's staff and customers. I 100% recommend going to Guu instead."}
{"text":"Overall good ambiance, service, and food. I give it only 3 stars as it pales in comparison to some other izakayas. I have been here a few times but most recently had the tako wasabi, smoky hay sashimi (BC tuna and yellowtail), aburi salmon sushi, ginger fried chicken, and Jaja beef. For dessert I had the taro potato ice cream and mochi, which are two separate items but I recommend combining them as the warm sesame mochi goes very well with the taro ice cream. 

I highly recommend the smoky hay sashimi which is seared sashimi but seared over burning hay, so it has a nice smoky taste to it. I liked the BC tuna more. The Jaja beef is also pretty good, and you can grill your own beef on the mini grill they provide, along with asparagus, oyster mushroom, and zucchini."}
{"text":"The unique culture of japanese bar is spreading in Toronto! Located near the intersection of Y&D square, It is definitely on the pricier side.

From decor and atmosphere, it's very Guu-like. But in terms of food, the menu is definitely more extensive but the quality of each dish is definitely lacking in some of the dishes we tried.  Location is on the 3rd floor with a hidden elevator so be prepared to climb a few flights of stairs when you're tipsey.

Because each dish is tappa-sized, Don Don is a great place to experiment different dishes family style. Each dish can range between 4 to $10. 

The smoke salmon was the highlight of my meal. You can see how they smoke it with their open kitchen concept and they slam on the drum while they smoke the fresh sashimi.

Other than that, none of the other dishes stood out to me."}
{"text":"When I saw the ad of DonDon's having a Niigata Festival, I kind of know I want to go back for a drink! 

Or was it my Yelp friend that knows so much about me wanting a night cap at the end of a non alcoholic food crawl took me here for some sake!

Kikusui ($12) at 30% off definitely a good bargain. 200 ml size is perfect for myself.. oh so I supposed to share?

Since we were sitting right by the kitchen, we decided to give  Yakitori ($4/2) another try as I had a so so experience last time. Watching my food prepared freshly in front of me at least I am sure that it was made to order, not like last time. But sadly though,   it was better than last time but still not as good as other Izakaya I been to.

Staff was polite and courteous, we never feel rushed even when I took my sweet time enjoying my sake.

I will be back for more sakes but I doubt I would have order more food!"}
{"text":"The four star rating is partly due to the restaurant's location--there isn't a ton of reliable choice in the area, and while Guu may still be the dominant force in creative izakaya in Toronto, Dondon offers a good experience.  

The bf and I ordered: the mayo shrimp, which was the standout dish for me, really tasty; wasabi nori chips, which were crunchy, tasty, but maybe could have used a bit more salt; miso marinated mackerel, which was pretty good as well but didn't blow my mind. We each tried a different ice cream, taro and black sesame, and both were good and about what you'd expect.  The menu has good variety, and it was fun to see the hay fire in action as we were seated in front of the kitchen.  Overall, lots of fun, and while not a true competitor of Guu, Dondon is still a welcome change of pace from the somewhat lower quality fare surrounding Bay and Dundas."}
{"text":"Not that good as I expected.
Atmosphere here is very nice and they got the big drum. But the food here is overpriced and you can't be very full unless you order a udon or bowl of rice.
As a Izakaya, they have variety of alcohol which really nice. I ALWAYS LIKE polar beer"}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit DonDon Izakaya a few weeks ago for the first time. It remined me a lot of my time living in Japan... I know everyone has commented on how it compares to Guu, but I will not make such a comparison as I have only been to Guu in Vancouver (which was great!). 

The atmosphere was great, the sake drums reminded me of my visits to Kamakura (if you have been you will know what I am talking about) and the food was very similar to what you would get at a typical good Izakaya in Japan. For me this is a great place to go with friends, have some snacks and drink your heart out - Absolutely love any place that has Japanese beer on Tap!!! 

Will definitely be back again. If I had one recommendation, it would simply be that the portion sizes were a bit bigger. You definitely need to order at least 6 or 7 dishes in order to get full for 2 people which is why I think its a great snack & drinking place (which is what Izakaya's generally are!)"}
{"text":"I went to have a quick lunch at the Don and asked the waitress for the friend ginger chicken. There were set meals as well as 'appetizer' size portions. I asked to confirm that the meal was small and she indicated that it was. When it was brought to me, it was the appetizer plate and not the set lunch. 
Clearly, it was a misunderstanding as her first language was not English so I wasn't about to make a big deal out of it. The actual chicken was delicious  but I ate two pieces and left the rest (fried doesn't travel well!). The part that I found really odd was after I asked for the bill, it was obvious that I didn't eat - she didn't enquire if I enjoyed the meal or for feedback but excitedly told me to come back again. 
Food: 7/10
Service 2/10 
Ambiance 8/10

I did give the manager / owner Tony some feedback and he was extremely receptive."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not amazing. 

Atmosphere is fun, casual, loud (in a good way) and feels authentic. 

Food is pretty good for the most part. Here's some bullets:

- Hay Shashimi Tuna was delicious and interesting. Fire flavour was unique
- hot dog was underwhelming
- pork kimchi udon was awesome. Do it
- fried chicken was meh
- pork buns rocked
- beer made all of the above taste better than normal perhaps"}
{"text":"Loud ass drum really distracting. food tasted mediocre and cost alot for a small portion."}
{"text":"Don Don Izakaya is located in the downtown core, and is steps away from St. Patrick subway station. The establishment is located upstairs, and whenever anyone arrives, they would be greeted with a loud drum roll. The atmosphere was relatively loud with chatter and overall just a lively one. 

Additionally, the seating arrangements are typical like other tapas/izakaya establishments; bar-side or communal tables. My friends and I only ordered four dishes, as they were there to basically drink (and we were also going to KBBQ after so we were saving room in our stomachs for that). 

We started out with the seafood udon ($7.60) which I really enjoyed. The texture of the udon was very chewy and the sauce wasn't bland at all. Additionally, there was a decent amount of seafood in the dish so that was good 

I wasn't too keen on trying the black croquette ($7.00) out at first as it didn't look that appetizing. However, I did try a piece of it and thought that it was a very interesting dish. The outer layer was crispy and inside contained a soft mixture of potato and cod.

The smokey hay salmon ($11.90) was fresh sashmi that is seared with hay fire to provide a smoky flavor. It tasted okay with the a slice of garlic, and salt, but was definitely not worth the price.

Lastly, we got the tako wasabi ($3.50) which was basically raw octopus and wasabi. The portion was a lot smaller than we anticipated and it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends after work. The saké is great and so was the sashimi. The server was quick and friendly. It was fairly noisy though but not bad for a Friday eve. Overall not a bad spot to hang with buds."}
{"text":"This place is strangely packed for being so mediocre and pricey. Half the items we got were piss-poor. The rest  were decent to good.

Bad:

seafood udon - where's the seafood? Couldn't find it.
don don potatoe wedges - they taste like regular potatoe wedges but without the taste or available ketchup to save a bland dish
cheese wonton - grossest dish of the night. Very bitter and salty.
jalapeno bomb - bland and chewy
ginger tofu - tastes like any regular tofu. Nothing special at all. Certainly not worth almost $5.
japanese omelette - tastes like omlette but blander and more pricey.

Decent:

Pork kimchi udon - needs more spice!

Good:

Shrimp mayo"}
{"text":"I love this place. I often visit here for dinner and bday party with my friends. I tried shrimp mayo, sashimi, 2 different kinds of sake, and shochu. I love their food, they are all great. This place is one of my favourite izakaya."}
{"text":"First experience at this place was pretty good. Second experience was not that great so I gave a mediocre review. Salmon sushi was just OK had much better elsewhere. Too much rice on it too. Had the seafood nabbe which was also just OK. Not enough seafood in it. Broth was kinda like soy sauce and water. Worst part was the tako wasabi which was the chewiest thing I've ever eaten to the point where I had to just swallow it because chewing for ten hours hurts my jaw. We sent it back and they said that's just how it is... odd... left the place feeling dissatisfied and honestly wouldn't return again. Ugh. Do not go here! Much better places elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday. Like most people I've heard many mixed reviews at this place, some like it, some hate it. I can empathize with both sides as the décor is truly immaculate and ambience is very fitting of an izakaya. However the food was beyond disappointing. 
Ordered the frozen beer float thing, shabushabu, wasabi tako, ginger fried chicken, potato wedges w/ curry powder, beef bowl. Most dishes were just generally \"meh\", so I'll begin with the worst of the worst. $8 for steamed bacon strips on cabbage....are you f*cking kidding me. I spend money where money's due but this place basically robbed me. IT's important to have principles as a human being but if a restaurant is to be opened with the claim of being an izakaya how could one possibly concoct such a lowly, gastronomically-insulting culinary dish? There is no technique or skill whatsoever involved in the making of this piece of junk and it was the only thing I needed towards the formulation of my decision of never returning. 
Everything else:
- wasabi tako; extremely chewy, overpowering wasabi sauce, felt like I was eating tadpoles. 
- Potato wedges; soggy, the wedges lacked structural integrity of what a well fried potato wedge should have
- Beef bowl; reminded me of my time with yoshinoya, which at a cheaper price was much better than Dondon's pathetic attempt at a classic Japanese rice bowl dish
- Frozen beer; cliché, novelty factor, how the f&ck did anyone decide frozen beer was going to taste good?
My advice is to come here just to get it over with, stamp your restaurant passport or whatever but this place just makes me so sad."}
{"text":"Came here again recently with a group of 6 and we had a great time! The service was great, he was polite, water and tea refills, came to check in on us etc. the food portions are great for lunch and the prices are excellent. I've never been here for dinner but I think the lunch specials are a win. The food is pretty good as well- everyone got chicken teriyaki and I got the chirashi bowl- comes with a gentoo serving of salad and standard miso. 

I guess it's variable depending on which server you get- some can barely speak English and others are great. 
Def give it a try!"}
{"text":"Coming here for the first time because we were craving some Japanese food. The menu is overwhelming and all over the place. I'm not a big fan of ramen so it's whatever to me but I tried the curry ramen which was on their special menu. I liked it! The ramen noodles were a bit chewy and semi similar to udon which is why I prob like it more than other ramen places. Curry was sweet and not too spicy. The tacos were okay - the chicken was a little bit chewy. Kept thinking it wasn't cooked but my stomach was fine so I guess the texture was supposed to be like that. The tonkatsu ramen was alright, soup base was pretty generic. Matcha shaved ice was also on special for under $5 and that tastes the same as anywhere else. 
I would come back only for the curry ramen."}
{"text":"It's more like a 3 1/2 stars for me. I wanted to try their bou sushi or bouzushi (???) which is a type of sushi presentation quite similar to oshi zushi where a whole fish is pressed over pressed rice. If you're interested to try it too, their lunch special is a great way try all 3 choices: salmon, eel, and mackarel!
 
I personally found the eel had the richest depth of flavour and they deboned it really well. The mackerel hands down would order again as it closely resembles what I would taste in a saba oshi. But the salmon fell a bit short for me where it wasn't seared enough to have a smokey profile. Still would prefer going to Miku or Jabistro for the aburi sushi but hard to compare."}
{"text":"Well, me and my friggin buddies came here on buddy Chuck's recommendation. Comin in the door wAs friggin deadly. Vibe was right, peeps bangin on drums, line chefs yellin (in a good way)... but, we were warned in an odd way that we had to order quick and last call was imminent. Fine. Vibe was good, food sounded killer. Ordered, 2 pitchers between 3 buddies, time: 23:22, 'closing time': midnight. Food came quite promptly, looked killer, tasted even better, lights low, weird k-pop-ish stuff on the horn in the sky. Then we get our bill after a couple bites, lights come on all bright like, music in the sky?!? Gone. These folks know a ton about a sweet restaurant with a killer menu and deadly follow through in the food department, but ended on a shitty vibe. I guess vibe is wicked important, and you can't vibe one minute, then not vibe all the way through. Ya know, man?!??"}
{"text":"I love how different their seating & dining room is set. It was also cool and fun to see the kitchen right in the dining room. This place is very different, I'll give them that. However, if you're looking food, I'd say go elsewhere.

I found that most of their foods were deep fried, anything that isn't seemed to be very expensive. Their cocktails are great, interesting combinations that you can't find elsewhere. I'm not a huge sake fan, but the have nice sampling sets to try. 

What turned me off from coming back here EVER were the actions of one of the cooks. Like I said, the kitchen is in the dining room; so you see the guys in action. However, I saw a cook playing with his greasy looking pony tail while waiting for whatever to cook. He soon used the same hand that was playing with his hair to use tongs, and touch plates. GROSS. WASH YOUR HANDS. WEAR GLOVES. WEAR A HAIRNET. SOMETHING!!! Such a turn off for me, my friends saw this too and thought it was gross."}
{"text":"I came here in a group for lunch during a conference happening nearby. I suppose the entrance way of the restaurant smelling like a public restroom probably should've been a strong sign that I shouldn't have dined here, so perhaps this was my fault. Most of us ordered lunch specials, each of which arrived at different times. I can understand not wanting cooked food to get cold, but watching everyone else eat their meals as I sat and awaited my sushi set was quite upsetting. When my food finally did arrive, it was most certainly not worth the wait: the side dishes were insipid and dull, and while the fish of my nigiri tasted alright, the rice underneath had no sushi rice texture or taste and completely fell apart. Moreover, my partner's bowl of rice, though it tasted fine, also smelled distinctly like a wet canine. How mysterious.

In terms of service, while the servers were polite and pleasant, it seems as if chopsticks and napkins were also in short supply at this restaurant, as it took over three tries to three different servers in order for me to acquire some. Considering that a Japanese restaurant couldn't get their damn rice in order, it was quite honestly a bad time."}
{"text":"The Okayo Don is good and recommended, but I think dinner might  be better... The ice cream is great in lunch, I might wanna try the dinner later to improve my experience here. By the way, the Gyu Don is quite salty... The sushi looks great, and tastes okay."}
{"text":"Came with twenty of my co-workers at 5pm for drinks this past Thursday. Despite making a reservation, we still had to wait for about ten minutes before we were seated. Our server was sweet but didn't speak English too well, so it was a little awkward at times but endearing! Most of our party ordered polar beers but I went with a peach cooler. It was alright. Tasted like an artificial, fruity soda. I have no idea what's actually in it and the server couldn't really explain it to me when I asked. We also got several sashimi platters, skewer combos (salt and teriyaki-style) and ginger-fried chicken. Everything was tasty and fresh...but omg, that fried chicken. Perfectly crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside...drooooool. This place is cool with a fun, lively atmosphere -- loved the 90's hip-hop jams playing!"}
{"text":"The place has a good fun vibe. But the food was disappointing. The tako wasabi, an izakaya staple was quite a let fown. It was very tough. The kitchen insisted this was normal. The redeeming trait is the drink menu."}
{"text":"The interior decor was very nice and inviting but when you enter a restaurant that is half empty during dinner time, it might be a bad sign. I really want to like this place but the food was a hit and miss. The menu has a great selection of alcohol and I've chosen Grapefruit sour as my drink-Not bad.
We ordered  the following items that was \"popular\" or chef recommendations 

Black seafood rice
Grilled squid
Smoky Hay Tuna
Chicken pancake
skewers
Beef Tataki
Out of all the items, 3 hits and 3 misses. The best was Beef Tataki, Grilled Squid and skewers. All of them tasted delicious.  Grilled squid was done to the perfection and so were the skewers. Chicken skewers were juicy and mouth watering.
The worst was the Black seafood rice and Smoky Hay Tuna. I am not sure how the black seafood rice was on the chef's recommendation list."}
{"text":"Definitely come here for the atmosphere and the experience. If it's a birthday celebration, the staff makes it a very loud and entertaining one. The interior decor had a Japanese vibe with wooden table and chairs.

The servers were really nice but they seem to focus more on clearing empty plates than anything else. For any other service, take initiative and flag them down or else it would just be an extremely long wait. All the dishes are meant to be share so they're appetizer sizes. Food came pretty quickly and as for taste it was average. Nothing stood out as amazing but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

Overall, great place to hangout with some friends. Grab a few plates to share and enjoy a beverage. The drink menu seemed to be about half the booklet."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife and another couple here on a Saturday night.  We had originally planned a bigger group but found out that you ideally need to book a day or two in advance for groups over eight.

The atmosphere was fun.  It is very noisy, but not abrasive. It was happy noise.  If you aren't familiar with Japanese culture and the importance of these wind down sake bars then it may alarm you when you're greeted by banging drums and fanfare.  You get the same experience on your way out paying your bill, turning even that menial task into an event!

Our server was incredibly nice, and other servers including the owner will check on you throughout to make sure your needs are taken care of.

The food was in traditionally small servings, which I like.  At our table we just ordered many dishes and shared everything.  The presentation was fantastic, and the food itself was delicious.  

They have a great Sake menu, divided up between Sweet, Dry and something in the middle.  I hate it when restaurants forget to do this with their Sake menu, and I think it's the main reason people think they don't like Sake.

After my wife and I shared a bottle of mid range Sake, and gorged on food and a few beers, end price was about $100.  

I'll be coming back for the drinks, the food and good times!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I were visiting Toronto and we happened upon this place. I gotta say that this place has one of the best ramen in Toronto. The donkatsu ramen and soy ramen were so good we ended up going again the next day. 

The staff were very friendly and helped us find the \"hot\" spots in Toronto, as well as taking sake bombs with us.

I will definitely stop by this place again the next time I visit, and highly recommend this place if you like ramen.

As a side note, we also tried KinTon ramen since it was highly rated, but KinTon doesn't even compare to Don Don. Don Don wins hands down"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here on a Saturday night and the wait was not long at all. We opted to sit at the bar so we got seated right away. We ordered five items on the menu and they came relatively fast. Everything was pretty good, I would say average compared to the other izakayas I've been to. I think it would be better to come here with more people so you can try more things on the menu. It's also best to see what the special menu has to offer since those are most likely going to be limited time or special price dishes."}
