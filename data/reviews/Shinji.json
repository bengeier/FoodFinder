{"text":"Wow seriously. Everything is delicious, every item on the menu is well rounded and complete. That tofu grillé with mushrooms was the best thing I've ever had.. And i'm really talking about tofu!! The chinook was zesty and tangy and delicious. Tuna tartar was so refreshing. We ordered three times because we wanted to try everything on the menu. Will be coming back, for absolutely sure!!!"}
{"text":"We recently went a Saturday night and we got a table in the bar area. The food was all around pretty good although the portions could have been a bit bigger. The service gradually got worse as the night progressed. This is surprising considering we were almost the only big table left. I expect stellar service when you pay more than a hundred dollars for your meal.  For the bad part, we felt like in a weird kind of sport bar with the TVs playing football and the DJ playing a random set of house and disco tracks. I though this was a Japanese sushi bar, my immersion was broken. All and all, will not be my first choice the next time I grave Japanese food."}
{"text":"Awful. Don't waste your time, money, energy, breath or anything on this place. I have never had such bad service and such mediocre food. The only saving grace was the 50% discount they gave us at the end to try to make up for it. In all honesty it wasn't even worth the 50% we paid. In all honesty that place isn't even worth the energy to write this bad review."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a while,   Never got around to going, we finally went. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff: oysters, tuna tartarre, seared wasabi crusted tuna, black cod with miso sauce, uni and tuna sashimi, and the maguro maki. The service was impeccable.  As you can see a lot of tuna. It's been a while since I've had good tuna and uni, not many places offer those items in mtl. Yes there is tuna in many sushi places but it just doesn't taste quite right... same with the uni.  The tuna last night was very good, it was soft and had a mild chewiness which I really liked. The uni was not as good, it was a bit runny but did taste fresh although it could have been better.  The black cod with miso sauce was the best dish of the night, the flesh was flaky, tender and juicy, the sauce was well balanced, even the bok choy and mushroom sides were cooked to point. A very pleasant dish I was seduced, we almost ordered another one.  The oysters were fresh and light, very nice, the waiter told us the salt underneath the shell is for decoration only hint hint don't eat it... we must have come off like idiots if he had to tell us that lol."}
{"text":"To be honest, it is on the pricier side but don't stop at the price and wait for the plate to come, you will me more than amazed! Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/11/21/shinji-a-mind-blowing-gastronomic-experience/"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant the decor is so unique. Friendly staff. If you go far back there is sushi bar where you can communicate with the chef and see how they prepare chef specialty. I never saw a sushi bar that neat and organized. The food is very good and nice plating! Would go back to eat chef shinji's omakase!"}
{"text":"Just got out this place a couple hours ago. First I was excited to make a reservation a couple weeks ago and then I saw a few bad reviews at the bottom, made me hesitant a bit, but the place is relatively new, I decided to give it a try and have an opinion on my own.   There's no fancy tricks here; the food is well presented, the fish is very fresh, nothing tasted fishy (we tried 10-12 different kinds of fish mostly raw dishes) we were pleased with everything overall.    Although each experience in restaurant may differ from one another, I do think that the quality was good, and for the amount of food and drinks we ordered the price was reasonable.   If you like type of maki sushi with tempura and lots of sauce (American style) and want to pay less and go for quantity then you won't like this place as much.   If you appreciate the freshness of fish and enjoy a few sip of sake, then I am sure you will like the place.   i will go back for another occasion and try more sashimi for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best sushis I had in my life (and I'm a sushi fan!).  Service is amazing and the food is extraordinary!  The cocktails are delicious! Lots of creatives plates on the menu.  Be ready to make new discoveries. I don't like the way tables are setup, you have to face your friend and strangers are seated nest to you.  Arrive early and take the tables near the window.  This place is highly recommended"}
{"text":"I'm an avid sushi connaseur who travels the world. I decided to try this because I heard that the master chief was Japanese and finding good sushi in Montreal is very difficult. Often there is too much sugar mixed in the rice or an excess and abuse of fusion cooking, thus distorting the authentic Japanese culinary history.   Unfortunately this restaurant was as disappointing. In fact more so. Who ever heard of putting licorice flavouring in maki rolls. Don't order the full tasting experience as most of the sushi was run of the mill low cost rolls, included were 2 pieces of tuna and salmon only.  They served oysters which tasted very fishy and except for the tuna I was unable to eat most of the food. The sushi chief obviously had distorted each an every recipe as I've been to Japan many times.  If you're a sushi connesseur you will be very disappointed. Even their Miso soup is distorted. Prices are high and I'd expect a Nobu meal for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Shinji opened recently and we've been looking forward to checking it out. Based on the interview that I heard with one of the owners Shinji was billing itself as an Izakaya.  I must say that the restaurant nor the menu has the feel of an Izakaya. That being said the food was very good and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.   Shinji's decor is unique with two tables that run the length of the main area of the restaurant. Although this results in you sitting right next to someone that you were not planning on having dinner with there are privacy screen that you can lower between you and your neighbor which are very effective. There is also a second seating area, downstairs in front of the sushi bar.   We started with the oysters, ceviche and scallops all of which were excellent. We then had the sushi for 2 and sashimi Moriawase. The fish was extremely fresh, they say they bring it in daily from NY, Vancouver & Japan, and the presentation was nice.   Overall the food was very good, although not mind blowing or particularly creative and fairly expensive. A great place to go for a special occasion, but not necessarily somewhere you would eat regularly."}
{"text":"Jiro would send you back to pounding octopus.  In Japan you only get to cut the fish after you've shown your skill with the knife. Here you probably do it in your first week on the job.  There's no way the chef cut our fish. It looked like the  tuna had been rescued from a shark attack. The uni was not the freshest. The fish selection was restricted and mostly run of the mill.  On the other hand the fish was mostly of very good quality, and the service was excellent. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Ambiance: On a décidé d'y aller le jour même, alors il ne restait plus de place aux tables. On était au bar sushi, ce qui n'était pas mal. Par contre, la disposition du bar de poissons ne nous permettait pas de voir les chefs travailler. C'est un très beau restaurant, quand même très grand avec plusieurs salles. Il y avait un bel éclairage tamisé et les lieux étaient propres.   Menu: J'aime les oursins de mer pour leur texture et il avait un gros oursin hors-menu qui était excellent. On a pris également une entrée de tataki de boeuf Kobe: assaisonnement parfait, pas trop salé et la texture du boeuf était impeccable. Pour souper, on a partagé une assiette de sashimi et une assiette de sashimi/nigiri/maki. Les poissons étaient tous très bons, il y avait une très très grande variétés. Nous étions amplement satisfait.   Prix: C'est le côté négatif du restaurant. N'eut été de la variété de poissons, ayant travaillé dans un restaurant sushi, j'aurais suggéré d'autres restaurants, mais il faut reconnaitre qu'ils ont une variété impressionnante de poissons. Ça nous a couté environ 200$ pour le repas avec une bouteille de 300 ml de saké froid pour 2. Arrivés à la maison, on avait encore faim. Il faut dire qu'on s'est laissé tenter par l'expérience avec le boeuf et l'oursin qui sont de petites entrées dispendieuses (20$ chaque). L'expérience en vaut certainement la peine par contre!   Service: Il ne semblait pas avoir assez de serveurs. On aurait bien pris un dessert, mais on a attendu tellement longtemps qu'on a eu l'idée d'aller prendre un dessert ailleurs. La serveuse nous avait dit qu'on pourrait poser des questions aux chefs sur le menu, mais ils n'ont pas semblé être enjoué pour répondre. Ils ne parlaient pas vraiment le français et comprenaient l'anglais, mais n'étaient pas très bavards."}
{"text":"My review of this restaurant would not be as negative if it hadn't cost us 200$. Hate to be the only negative review here, but here goes..  We started with an oyster which tasted exactly like a spoonful of ocean water.   Then we were blessed with a terrible tomato soup that came with floating bits of sashimi and some crunchy bits of salt.   After suffering through the second course, we got our \"sashimi salad\" which consisted of 1 cubic inch of vegetables and some pieces of sashimi mixed in with the fishiest caviar I've ever had.   The plate consisted mostly of \"fried\" rolls and about 3 pieces of tuna and 3 pieces of salmon nigiri.   $200.06"}
{"text":"Un peu dispendieux mais le service amical, le coté original de la bouffe sont un must"}
{"text":"I am from NY and am an avid sushi eater. This spot was absolutely amazing. Food was great, music was great.  Service was wonderful ( thank you Oli and Mia) definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Ce soir dans le cadre de Montréal Bar et Bouffe nous voici au Shinji. Dans cet avis je ne parle que de la partie bar du shinji car nous ne sommes pas allés au restaurant.  Le lieux est très sympathique et j'adore la musique qui passe (rock classique) sans être trop forte et dérangeante. Cela permet de discuter sans avoir à crier.  Dans le contexte l'événement nous avons pris un accord cocktail-plat et vraiment c'était au top. Le cocktail était délicieux et l'assaisonnement du plat nickel. En plus nous avons pris des raviolis au porc très goutteux ainsi que l'assiette de maki. Cette assiette était réellement très bonne. Il y avait 3 types de maki et chacun était vraiment un délice.  Au niveau du service, parfois c'était un peu long pour avoir de l'eau mais en générale rien à signaler de particulier.  Nous sommes réellement satisfait de notre soirée, cela nous a permit de découvrir un très bon bar où les cocktails sont de qualité et où il est possible de grignoter aussi des encas. Nous reviendrons de sur et essayerons de tester le restaurant pour donner une note finale :)"}
{"text":"Best japanese restaurant experience. The service is thoughtful and attentive.  We ordered the omakase and everything was just amazing. If you want to treat yourself and splurge, go to Shinji. It was worth the money!"}
{"text":"Kinda weird to go to an Asian restaurant and being served by non asian people...but food Turner out great.   Went there on a Saturday night at 8 and although we had a reservation,  the restaurant wasn't full.  Started with the chef's sashimi salad and it was delicious! Continued with the grilled calamari with udon noodles which was fantastic as well. then took some kanpachi in a dashi sauce. The fish was really fresh and sauce really enhanced the flavor or the fish.   Took some sashimi and it was excellent quality. We then finished with 3 différents maki rolls. The maki were ok but nothing unforgettable like the previous dishes we had. I find that the rolls had too much rice in them.  I would definitely go back for more specialties and sashimi, but skip the maki.  Reasonably priced for the kind of food and location. Service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I dined at on my trip to Montreal! The black cod was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten! The service and manager were superb! I highly recommend Shinji!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants I've gone to yet. Great atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food. I would go again in a heart beat. They even brought my friend and I cake as my friend indicated it was our birthdays on the reservation. I had the tempura shrimp to start and black cod and Wagyu beef."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for New Years Eve for the second service for 10 pm. It was a fixed six service menu. When we made our reservations, the host said that we wouldn't regret it! Hmm...well we kinda did. First we were seated and waited about 15 minutes before the waiter even noticed us. His attitude was very nonchalant and almost too friendly for my liking. Maybe that's just me. Anyways,we got there and wanted to start with a cocktail. On a night like New Year's Eve you would expect them to have everything that is on the menu right? No. So I had to settle for a cocktail that the waiter suggested me. I didn't like it at all. Do I dare say it?.. It tasted like barf. At 12$-14$ a small drink, I wasn't expecting this. Then, fifteen minutes later, after finishing out drinks, the waiter asked us if we were \"finally\" ready to eat. Food came. The oyster was ok. Nothing out of this world! We after that had a salad, blah, blah, blah, sashimi. Blah, blah, blah, sushi. Blah, blah, blah, kobe beef that was so chewy... Wait isn't Antonio Park the only chef in Canada with a permit allowing him to import Kobe beef? That's another subject. Then just before the countdown, the waiter gave us a flute of bubbling wine and our dessert plate. We barely touched either. All that being said, the dishes looked really good but lacked in taste and quality. I was expecting so much more. Especially when the bill came. 450$!!! \"For what???\" I said to my husband. Maybe we're paying for the fact that it's owned by Jeff Stinco? I don't know. I didn't let this bad experience ruin our New Year Eve but we are NOT coming back here."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered a tuna tartar. The portion of a meal is the amount a 1 year old would eat. Such a small portion for $17. And it wasn't even good."}
