{"text":"Once again, yelp has not failed me.  This place has great food.  The meat was tender and very flavorful, and the salad was fresh with the dressing spot on.  They were very accomodating to a last minute order change.  The baklava was a perfect way to end the meal :) This is one of those places that I want to try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Great find!!! :) yummy food! Yummy gyro! Yummy souvlaki! yummy yummy!!! And friendly service!!! We are coming back!!"}
{"text":"Was craving a good Gyro and after a Yelp search decided on this place! The reviews do not lie, one of the best Gyro's I've had in a long time! Got the Big Fat special which includes a Big Fat Gyro, fries (which I upgraded to greek fries for a small upcharge) and a regular fountain soda. Total came out to about $12 which is not bad because the Gyro was definitely big, fat, delicious! The fries were also very good - nice and hot on the inside, crispy on the outside, just like good fries should be. Highly recommend and will come back again next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"I was recently fortunate to have been treated to lunch at this restaurant.  It was fantastic. The service was great, the portion size was very good and even if I would had to buy, it was very reasonable. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Service was great - food came out fast and was amazing. This is already a spot I love and have only been there once. I Will be returning. The dining area was clean - the atmosphere completes the experience.  Gyro plate Greek fries  Pork Loin Pita.... you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've missed having a good gyro sandwich having lived in Chicago.  This one today was really good.  My second visit here. Today's gyro and fries were not even hot."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for for fast food dinner.  Or for a catered affair.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great place to meet after the sports park. Went with family and friends had gyros, chicken cababs, salad and hummus.pizza was a little dark but only on the edges. Hummus appetizer was nice fresh and served w toasted pita. Fast and made to order. Second time ead better than the first time we went."}
{"text":"The best!  Try the gyro and chicken plate, you won't be disappointed.  Always great taste, quality, quantity and value - unbelievable(we keep meaning to try other items on the menu, but we really love this meal).  It includes the best tasting rice, pita bread and greek salad.  We have tried all the Greek places in Vegas over the years and you can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"It's a nice clean casual dining experience with very good food and friendly service.  The yummy delights are much tastier than Gyro Time or Market Grille Cafe.  The portion sizes are huge.  I haven't found a meal here that allows room for dessert yet (especially since it's so hard to resist a side of their luscious Greek fries!)...must keep trying."}
{"text":"First time I had to wait over 20 minutes for a take out order. Even if they gave me a compliment drink for waiting. It was still uncomfortable waiting. Also, another issue after you get home and you find out your order is not exactly what you order is bad. I have came to this restaurant for the last 5 years but have moved to the southwest side of town. I guess being moved for about a year has made the service change. I will think twice about  stopping by and grabbing food on my way home."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food this is the place to go awesome food and make sure to try the saganaki!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years now and again and again the food is always consistently good. We've tried almost everything on their menu by now and never at a loss as to what to order - it's ALL good. The gyro meat is one of the best we've ever had anywhere, very moist and has a great flavor. Service is friendly and reasonably quick since all food is made to order. I especially enjoy their lemon herb chicken souvlaki. I'm not a big steak fan so I wish they could also include lamb on their menu. The pita is soft and plentiful. The rice is a winner! Try the Greek Pizza - a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend. Went durning lunch hour and line was out the door!  I never mind waiting when there is a line, just means it's good!  I got the chicken and beef skewer combo.  I forgot to take a picture, I need to remember to do that.  Oh boy, the rice it comes with is so good. It was fluffy and seasoned so delicious.  Everything was really good and you get a lot of food.  Definitely going back there is do much I need and want to try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant. Great customer service and I loved my big fat gyro. Not that expensive and worth a try!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed great food but last two times I called for delivery (a week apart) they did not have a driver available on a Wednesday night and today after visiting their website and ready to order a substantial worth of food I was informed they don't deliver unless it's a large party? Please change your website as it is misinformed. You guys have great food but being let down again does not persuade me to visit again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years since its first year and the quality is consistently good if not even better now and the portions have never minimized unlike many successful restaurants that get greedy!  For $11 I get a delicious chicken kabob, plenty of Gyro meat, yellow rice, salad, and pita bread...a meal that lasts 2 days and I usually don't even eat leftovers but I look forward to stretching this out! The owner is always appreciative and nice, humble guy =)"}
{"text":"I ordered a plate and I'm giving it two stars because of the gyro but the spinach pie, rice and salad were bland!  The avgolemono soup was just ok! They put a thickener in it which I definitely did not care for!The service was just ok too! Cashier spoke like he was in a race and the server was not very friendly at all!  I'll come back for a gyro but nothing else!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, addicting to say the least. Staff is amazing too, food is made to order and is always delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Im back again! The food is still worth the U Turn you have to make on Charleston.  They are sprucing up the place still same great greek feel and same great staff!"}
{"text":"Best food in town! I could eat here daily. It's a cafe' style restaurant and stays pretty busy. Try the Chicken Souvlaki plate! Rice, salad, pita, and juicy chicken scewered."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident on a trip out to Suncoast.  It's edible.  This isn't the most delicious or authentic greek food I've ever had, but it isn't terrible.    Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but also wouldn't tell anyone it's not worth trying at least once.  Overall, just average."}
{"text":"bill and I eat here every Friday for lunch, last week I tried the Greek pizza. it was out of this world (with chicken) this week (today) I will try it with chicken and gyros. this is the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas hands down.!!!!!!!!!!!  jeff b ( a Chicago transplant)"}
{"text":"First, this place gets busy during lunch and there are always patrons up until closing time, It is a real food find on the west end of town.  Yassou Greek Grill Café is my favorite little Greek restaurant in Las Vegas.  This unassuming restaurant serves up some of the most delicious Greek food in town.  My favorite is their Chicken Souvlaki platter.  It is served with two skewers of savory, tender chicken and comes with a small salad, buttery, lemon rice, warm, fresh pita bread and cool and creamy Tzatziki sauce this meal is very filling.  Their menu has all the standard Greek favorites such as Gyros, Spanakopita, and Dolmades. Other notable menu items are the Greek Fries served crispy and hot served with spices and feta cheese. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The one drawback is the parking lot is small and hard to navigate any vehicle larger than a Mini Cooper. Yassou Greek Grill Café is located at 7871 W. Charleston near Buffalo, their phone number is 702-798-8989 daily hours Monday-Saturday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.   Now open on Sundays and the food/quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy! I love Yassou. This place is really laid back, the perfect place for lunch. The food is amazing. I always order the chicken gyro plate with a side feta fries (can't resist). The portions are great and the food is always fresh. Definitely one of the best Greek grilles in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"OK I really don't wanna oversell it because it takes away the kind of surprise I enjoyed today on my first visit, but in fairness I have to say it was stunning! Almost unbelievably good...as in: I had to pause mid-mouthful to make sure I wasn't dreaming! I got the under $8 lunch special with a chicken and a beef skewer, greek salad, pita and rice (oh the rice! 'wasn't expecting mild mannered little grain like rice to be such a star!) The chef (whom I could see from my seat) even took time out from cutting up fresh cucumber (by hand) to make sure I was enjoying my order. I don't care if you live on the east side, get yer butt to the west side, order some greek food and get happier with each bite. :)"}
{"text":"The workers were kind and greeted us well, and I recommend the big fat special if you're really hungry. Their gyros are amazing and their Greek fries are really good too."}
{"text":"I really like the clean atmosphere,everything tasted good, spanikopita was a bit dry, Greek fries were just ok and the big fat pita was not bad, but just kinda basic, the Sevier here was great very polite people, very fast, i just can't get past the basicness of the food nothing stood out as fantastic"}
{"text":"Yassou is worth trying.  My most favorite restaurant ever. Hedary serves similar food but is way more expensive and inferior in flavor.  Yassou: please close later on Sundays,  i cannot make it before 5pm. 8pm is a great time to close haha.  I went to Hedary to fill the void cuz you closed so early and i was not very pleased, not going back there."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on 11/20/2010.  I ordered a Gyro (platter).  It was quite good. I love these and had not eaten one in a very long time.   I found the side of greek salad lacking a bit, it had enough cheese & dressing, but otherwise was all lettuce (only one olive).  I would have liked to see more \"stuff\" in the salad.    The \"lamb\" was a little dry, not ready to believe its always this way though. Having only eaten here once, this may have only been the luck of the draw, not sure. I will certainly try it again."}
{"text":"Probably the best gyros I had outside of Chicago. The only downside if I had to pick one would be that they are a little light on the sauce. The portions are generous and the veggies were just right. Their fries are a tad on the expensive side, but their portions more than make up for it. The service and cleanliness is also a big plus. I would definitely go back, but will order extra sauce on the side."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local spots in Vegas for lunch. The food is consistent and delicious. This family-owned and run restaurant is a great option for a delicious lunch or dinner. We often share an order of Saganyaki (fried cheese!!!) and then it's either the Big Fat Gyro of the steak souvlaki pita for me!"}
{"text":"Wow this is probably the best service I have received from any restaurant in Las Vegas. While it's hard to find decent Greek food in town, I would have to say that this is probably #2 on my list. Plus they still accommodated us when we showed up 15 mins prior to closing. There were a couple items that prevented it from getting a 5-star rating. So let's break down the food.   A great way to help judge a Greek restaurant is by ordering their hummus and we did just that. They provided quite a bit of pita and croutons for you to dip in your hummus, unfortunately the hummus had no flavor. There was no lemon zest or taste of olive oil that normally comes through at other places. Heck I'm not much of a salt person and even I thought it needed some sodium.   Next up, we had their Greek fries covered in Greek seasoning, feta and parsley...I thoroughly enjoyed these. These would be so good with a gyro!  Now the main dishes - Your steak souvlaki was overcooked and tough to chew. Your chicken souvlaki was the savior as the robust flavors bursted in my mouth. Ah yes! Your lamb was tender and flavorful. Surprisingly it wasn't very greasy either.  Your tzatziki sauce wasn't as thick and tart as other places. I could swear it tasted more like sour cream than Greek yogurt, but whatever, it was still good. The rice was instant rice which was ok but I love me some homemade rice. The salad was good, mine just had a bit too much dressing.  The owner is a great guy and constantly checked on us to make sure we were satisfied with the food. Though it seems pricey, I thought for 3 people it was a great deal especially all the food we ate."}
{"text":"Great Greek food for lunch or a quick dinner!    The lamb/beef gyro was excellent!  We ordered the hummus before our meal and it was perfect!  Friendly staff and reasonable prices!  It was busy for a late lunch, but the service was fast."}
{"text":"First time impression: I read reviews and thought this restaurant must be pretty good......NO!!! Had the gyro plate and meat was just like leather. Was thinking to make shoes out of it! I gave 2 stars only for the service...for the food 0 stars."}
{"text":":):):) hi I was also there on it happened, I'm a regular here for the past 5 years, I love the food and the staff , it feels like family ... About the overpowering thing the lady exaggerated , it was just a discussion between employes, I know all of them and they are very friendly with customers and between them.               The food is the best in town and overall this is the best restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Hands down best Greek food I've had. Mom and pops owned. When you see dad in the back cooking, it gives you comfort and you just know he's making sure your foods delicious.  BTW, he's not my dad but he's someone's dad in there.   If you haven't yet, check it out you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"YUMM YUMM YUMM!!!! Found this place on accident and couldn't be happier that I did. The lunch special is the best and can't beat the price! I love this place! Parking can be tough if it's during the lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go!!! Family owned and very authentic Greek food. The staff is always kind. Things I've tried on their menu: Mediterranean cheese pizza, spanikopita, big fat gyros, Greek fries, yellow rice, the salads, fruit smoothies  and the lemon herb chicken....it's all delicious!!! The chicken was juicy and very flavorful. The gyros are the stuffed with meat and toppings. I've dined it and ordered for pick up and it's never been disappointing."}
{"text":"First time for my me and my husband.  I am of Greek decent and this tastes just like Yiayia's cooking. We will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I usually come during lunch hours ,and its always crowded.  I came on a Saturday night...and it was just as packed.  I can see why...the lemon chicken pita is fantastic!  And very generous with the portions!.  Also the spanikopita and hummus were just as tasty.  I've known the owners since they ran Lou Christian Dry Cleaners.  Their customer service was spot on there...and equally good here.   Just wished they gave you more napkins. .."}
{"text":"Happened to be on this side of town, which for some reason the good Greek restaurants seem to be (I'm Greek, live in Henderson...get with the program people), and happened to stop to have a bite to eat. I'm very glad I did. First of all, the people are very friendly and gave us a sample of the Greek custard dessert they had, which of course we purchased.   My friend and I both got the gyro plate and were both pleased. The beef/lamb was seasoned just right and I loved the salad and rice that the plate comes with. I usually don't eat the rice, but theirs was good. Now for the custard dessert...wow, this was delicious. It was a generous piece that my friend and I shared, warm custard, topped with phyllo and of course, some honey. Highly recommend.   I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, one of my favorite Greek restaurants in town!  This is, surprisingly, one of the only places in the whole city with taramosalata - my favorite Greek dip!  The service is fast, the food is cheap, really, I couldn't ask for more :]"}
{"text":"Being greek I'm extremely picky about greek food. This place has some of the best gyros and tzaskiki that I have had in the states.  The greek fires are also pretty solid. If your in the mood for a gyro this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Las Vegas.  It's nice to see a real family owned and run restaurant where they actually care about the customers.  The staff is always friendly and the food is super tasty.    Our family has been eating there since they opened and the food is consistently great.  The dining room area was recently expanded to allow more diners during busy times.    Go there and try it, you won't be disappointed.  If you are feeling daring, order a Greek coffee and have the owner's son make it.  He makes it perfectly."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of the top Greek restaurants on my list. Went there today with a coupon from the Entertainment book and discovered that they will no longer take the electronic version of the coupon, which I have used here before. Based on principle, I'm giving them a 1 star review. Don't offer an electronic coupon if you're not going to take it. Furthermore, at least post a sign that you're no longer accepting the coupon."}
{"text":"I had the chicken kebab plate. Plenty of chicken (2 skewers) the rice and were also very delicious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been going here since they opened and not only is the food excellent the family is always glad to see you. They started small, but have expanded there seating and staff to accommodate the rush.There are so many things on the menu that are excellent and I usually order a side of Spanakopita and Taramasalata (with extra pita) to start, as I like to take it home to snack on later. The portions are generous, and I am always torn between the Chicken Salad or the Super Chicken Gyro, both are fantastic. Allow yourself a little extra time during the lunch hour or call ahead as they have a big rush of people and the parking is terrible. There are very few spots and it is difficult to maneuver through the narrow parking lot when its full."}
{"text":"We had the Greek Salad and Beef Gyro with a side of rice pilaf. I must say it is one of the best Mediterranean restaurants here in Vegas. Definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town! Staff is super friendly and food is delicious. Chicken Souvlaki and Gyros are must haves."}
{"text":"I've been going to this establishment since I was a little kid. It always brings back good memories. The employees are always great and the food is always spectacular. This is the best Greek food in Las Vegas hands down. I highly recommend it. What's better than supporting a family owned restaurant. If you want Greek food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place in Las Vegas, hands down. It would be stellar based on the food alone - not only is it authentic and delicious, but you can tell that someone actually cared about what they were making. On top of that, the staff and service people are always polite, cheerful, kind and courteous. This is honestly the kind of place I could eat every single day and it would never get old. I appreciate these guys and definitely recommend anyone who loves Greek food (or food at all) give it a shot."}
{"text":"I will literally drive 8 hours down from Reno just to eat here. The best Greek food I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Service was professional and courteous PLUS the food was DEEEELICIOUS at a great price!!!!! WILL BE BACK FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"Very good :) the steak and chicken are perfectly marinated.  Pita was the only disappointment, it just wasn't the best.  Otherwise, it was great"}
{"text":"Food is great- I recommend getting your food to go- LARGER PORTIONS! Always very fast, exceptional customer service and foodies very tasty!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I've ordered everything, and it's simply fresh, great tasting food. Customer service is fantastic, even when they're busy. I think it's family owned and run, so go support a local business for a change. Oh, If they have rice pudding, get it, the simplest, tastiest dessert ever."}
{"text":"I love the food... too many house flies for me to deal with!!  On six or seven visits the flies are terrible... with the open lamb meet it makes me sick to think about it.  If they do something about it then I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I had the 6 oz herb chicken pita and it was delicious. I also added a Cyprus smoothie (strawberry and mango_ which was quite tasty. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Nestled upon the Southwest hill of Buffalo and Charleston is this local gem that all must visit opening at 11am.   Today I had the Calamari under the Greek Plates section of the menu. It was the best calamari I have ever had, and I have had a lot of calamari in my lifetime. The plate was generous for the price; with salad, rice, and the fluffiest pita bread I have ever had surrounding.   The sauce that was also provided with the Calamari plate would be a world wide phenomenon if it was ever bottled and sold. I can't quite pinpoint all the flavors in it, which leads me to believe it is something special. All I can tell you is that you must try it for yourself and be enthralled in its zesty goodness as I was today.   The place is very well kept and clean with table clothes and sturdy chairs. It's as authentic as you can imagine. With authentic Greek Coffee in their Espresso Bar, Gyros, Hummus, Pita Sandwiches, and all sorts of authentic sounding appetizers and plates. They even have imported Greek Olive Oil and Greek Coffee Grounds for purchase.   The service was beyond excellent and as I was standing by the cashier to pay for my meal, I read a framed article about the place. It was then I realized that I was served by the owner himself and his family.   It was a wonderful experience and I am now determined on completing all of the menu."}
{"text":"My go to spot for Greek! Service is always 1000% Owner is on location so that's nice.  The meat is just perfect and is made with care. Juicy and tasty ALWAYS.  The yogurt sauce is amazing but they make you pay for extra in those little plastic cups. ( so that kinda sucks) but I pay eat. Eat it. Then come back for more always. :-)  I also bring all my friends to introduce them to the best Greek that I've found.  So check it out! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Greek place in the whole city. I love the home-cooked taste of the meats and dessert. Their tzatziki over a warm pita is heavenly. I honestly can't even go into detail about how good the food is. Just go try it!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food this side of Athens. Family-owned; they treat customers as they would treat guests at their home for dinner. I have tried almost everything on the menu--it was all great. My favorite is the Super Lemon Herb Chicken Pita. Makes my mouth water just to think about it."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! It's vegetarian-friendly, but not vegan-friendly, because of all of the feta cheese. My personal favorites are the Greek fries & the spanakopitas. Spanakopitas are kind of like spinach & feta turnovers.  I should warn new-comers, they don't make falafels. According to the owner (who is a nice man that loves his restaurant), falafels are Mediterranean, but not Greek. He only serves strictly Greek food. At first I wasn't sure about the place, because of that, but it helped me try new foods that I probably wouldn't have given the chance otherwise.  It's definitely worth trying! I now come here at least twice a month. :)"}
{"text":"Not friendly, tables were dirty. Food was good though... Came here before and got a salad which came with a minuscule amount of dressing, they seemed inconvenienced when I asked for more, they then gave me a second minuscule lil cup of dressing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, the service was great and so was the food! Definitely worth all the 5 stars on the Yelp reviews. Especially those cashier guys. Shout out to them! However, this time I brought my mom and sister to try. We ordered 2 entrees and greek fries. When we got our food, my sister went to go ask for one extra plate from the man, which I believe is the owner or management. He wanted to charge $1 for one extra plate...I've never been charged for an extra plate before anywhere. Quoting what he said, \"It's a dollar if you share like that.\" Share like what? We have 3 people and 3 things, sorry we wanted share...we just wanted one plate, we didn't ask for 10. I don't know but that made me really mad. I also don't want to pay an extra dollar for a plate I'm going to throw away in 20 mins. By the way I'm one of those broke college students, when every dollar counts. I can buy a super large drink at mcdonalds for that dollar. I'll be getting to-go or bringing my own plates from now on, but I don't think we will be going back for awhile. Call me a cheapo."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years and have always had a good experience. This is a family owned business and they all work very hard to make it a great place."}
{"text":"My big fat Gyro is so good and don't forget the Greek fries ( with feta and garlic). It makes the meal. My family and I live in Louisiana and whenever we are in Las Vegas we go to Yassou Greek Grill with out fail. Everything is good and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"we discovered this place about a year ago and have always enjoyed the food but today's experience was horrible.  We have put up with the high prices (2 plates & 1 drink always seem to come out to $20+) & super long wait time, (for a FAST food place) but today was the worst.  In order to avoid waiting the usual 15+ minutes I called ahead.  When my husband paid, the cashier got the order wrong that had been given over the phone.  My husband had to correct her a few times in the same transaction.  We thought it was strange we were not given a receipt or a table number.  Over the phone they had told us it would be ready in 10 min but it took 19.  We were once again waiting.  Also, over the phone I had said I was calling in advance to eat there, yet they set up our food in to go boxes - but didn't give us a bag...I don't understand the logic there.  When we got the food both to go boxes had smeared food marks on them - looked very unsanitary & unprofessional, and the order was wrong STILL.  We had been charged $2 for the extra rice my hubby ordered, but it appeared that they simply substituted his salad for a small amount of rice because the salad was missing altogether!  To make it right, they quickly (for once) made a salad to go, but even THAT box had smears of food or whatever on it.  GROSS!  The one good thing about this place is that the food always tastes great, but after this experience we may be looking for a new local Greek place."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spot for the big fat gyro. One of the best I've had. If you haven't tried this place. You are missing out."}
{"text":"I tried this place and loved it.  They make ever to order, and at a reasonable price.  If you are wanting some good greek food this is your place"}
{"text":"Hands down the greatest gyros I've ever had. I'm from NYC so I know what a quality gyro tastes like. That being said this is the only restaurant in Las Vegas that truly makes an amazing gyro with abundant amounts of quality meat full of amazing flavor and the price is just right!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, decent-sized portions, reasonable price.  Tried the Super Gyro, it's good, and the Chicken Souvlaki Plate is tasty with good sized portions."}
{"text":"I just came back from a Europe trip and really missed some authentic food. This place is hands down the best Greek joint in town! You have to try their lemon herb chicken with anything you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and service great. The portions are not small at all from their appetizers, sandwiches or plates. They have a nice variety too."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here the other day and the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly. We ordered 3 Super Mini Specials,The Big Fat Gyro, and the Gyro Plate. If you are looking for a way to try different meats the Super Mini Special is the way to go as you get chicken, lamb and beef kabobs."}
{"text":"LOVE. God I miss it.  Run by a honest-to-goodness Greek family, this place is home-cooked Greek food heaven. And the portions are huge- if you get a plate, you'll have a meal for tomorrow too!  The ambiance isn't great, but let's be honest-- few places in Vegas give you that. If you're in Vegas, you aren't there for the scenery. So get over it.  I digress. Back to the food, oh God the food. The gyros are whopping fistfuls of juicy, perfectly seasoned delight. The spanakopita is just flaky enough to give you the feeling that you're eating something healthy-- but it's Greek, so you're not. The steak souvlaki..... sorry, just choked on my own drool. Perfectly tender, marinated, I'll even lick the skewers those beautiful chunks of meat are served on.  Every time I'm back in town, I make sure to stop here. Still haven't found an equivalent in my new city. I no longer believe that is possible.  ...Now I'm depressed."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great food and a great value!  The gyro and chicken plate are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Yassou is great for greek food!  Everything I've had there has a great flavor.  The meats are juicy and tender.  The salads are fresh and makes me feel like I'm eating healthy. I still have a few things I'd love to try on their menu like the spanakopita and dolmades.  I've had their \"Big Fat Gyro\" sandwich which has everything you need for a good lunch especially when I am limited on time.    The ambiance is lacking but the food more than makes up for it.  Everyone working there was super nice and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Nothing special, average food for way too high of prices. Food lacks flavor, people are nice. Way better Greek food in town"}
{"text":"I have gone to Yassou Greek Grill twice now for lunch and both times it has been a top notch experience. First off their prices appeal to a heeb like me. You can get a huge gyro platter for under $10 bucks, it filled me up both times I have had it. You would be paying $15 or more at another Greek restaurant for a similar dish.   The title of Best Greek food I have had in Las Vegas is a toss up between Market Fresh Grille and Yassou Greek Grill Cafe. Both have been consistently high in quality and taste of the food. The variety of food on the menus will keep you going back for more. But the tie goes to Yassou because of the excellent economical pricing."}
{"text":"The food could have been served hotter, the gyro meat could have been moister and more flavorful, the staff could have been a lot more knowledgeable and friendly, and the soda machine could use more carbonation. Too many other Greek food options in town for me to ever consider returning."}
{"text":"Best Greek in town outside the Strip.  I always get the Gyro Plate here for lunch.  Just sucks they close Sunday's."}
{"text":"Nice location and atmosphere.  The chicken kabob that I had was awesome - tender and tasty.  Good prices.  Too bad I haven't found a Greek restaurant this good near me."}
{"text":"The best place to get a gyro. Meat is tender, pita bread is fresh and the sauce appears to be homemade. People are friendly and service is great. No better place for Greek food"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the Olympic Veggie Pita in my life I ever experienced such a tasty and delicious sandwich. The service was great and the place was clean as a whistle. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"My experience there was very nice. The company that I work for rented space for a celebration. The people that work there accommodated our needs, and were very friendly.  The thing that caught my attention was that this was a catered event but, they still were kind enough to take orders of people that had dietary restrictions. It's a small cozy place, and I would go back! And of course the food was great!"}
{"text":"It's kind of like walking into a mass production restaurant. If looks like everything is made on an assembly line. The gyro I ordered had old, limp onions on it. The onion's tasted like sweaty armpits. The Greek french fries had way too much salt on them. I threw them out. What a waste of money.  I have never gone back."}
{"text":"I frequent Yassou almost on a weekly basis.  This is the best GREEK food in town.   If you go for lunch, try to go before 12, otherwise, there is aways a line!  I prefer eating at places that have a line because that tells you the food is fresh and yummy.  They have a few awesome lunch specials.  You can even use a coupon from the Entertainment!  The chicken kabobs are the best/ If you like Gyros, order the big fat with feta and Greek fries.  They also have a lemony soup that's great for our weather now. YK"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy eating at this restaurant.  The staff is always friendly, the food tastes great, and it's very clean.  My favorites are the Super Steak Pita, the Gyro, and the Combo Souvlaki.  Tastes very much like my families dishes from Greece.  As good as it gets when it comes to authentic!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant..try the super chicken pita sandwich.  The rice and Greek salad is the best in town.  Their baklava is so delicious.  Everyone is friendly.  You can call ahead and order on the way if you are in a hurry! 100%"}
{"text":"Love, love love Yassou. I come here with my family and we the share vegetarian plate, greek salad, beef souvlaki & chicken souvlaki. Even though the fries are very good, we skip those and pay for the extra salad because....... their house made salad dressing is sosososososos GREAT. The salads, btw, are perfectly dressed."}
{"text":"This my favorite Mediterranean restaurant  in Las Vegas. Great prices for the amount of food you get. The staff is always friendly and easy to talk to. The service is #1. My once  week must have."}
{"text":"A favorite place to get greek food. The value for your money is amazing. I've been going there for years and most of the time I could barely finish the portions. My favorite dish is the Steak Souvulaki plate which comes with two steak skewers, salad, rice, pita bread and amazing home made yogurt sauce. The greek pizza is amazing as well. There's a family feel when you get inside, it's almost like visiting your grandma for lunch. Very nice friendly people, and can't say that enough the best greek food in Las Vegas. It's a must try joint"}
{"text":"A very warm and friendly place, all the employees are so nice and always are so polite.  The food is so tasty, succulent tender chicken prepared with savory seasonings along with rice and \"green\" lettuce for your salad with a light oil, not the half green and yellow lettuce at some places. If your looking for \"real\" authentic Greek food, you have found eureka!"}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest restaurants here in vegas, the food is always excellent and the customer service is outstanding! I highly recommend coming here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Hummus was lacking in all zest. 3/10  Taramosalata is reminiscent of mayonnaise, with a hint of yogurt. 6/10  Dolmades are zesty and delicious despite being half heartedly wrapped.   10/10  Yassou Gyro is tasty, a great gyro.  9/10  Big Fat Gyro is also tasty with a little kick with the feta cheese.  10/10"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Vegas had the Gyro plate, Was excellent great portion size pita bread was warm and toasty, came with a salad and rice on the plate lots of meat!!, best i have had yet, wish i would have know about this place sooner, wife has been craving Great Greek food since she was prego. Owner was very friendly, Great customer service A++, Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  Minus 1 star for having Faux News on the TV... what is with these businesses who feel it necessary to show you they can't think for themselves and need fox to tell them what to think.. honestly I usually won't frequent a business that does this... I hope they get the message."}
{"text":"My son who lives in Summerlin recommended this place while we were visiting. We love Greek food and were happy to try it for lunch. Punch line ... The food was so good and tasty that we have since gone back a second time with in the week, this time with our granddaughter. I had the steak and gyro plate while the wife and gdaughter split the chicken and pork slovaki plate. The portions are big and everything is made after you order, so it's fresh and hot. Service is fast and friendly. Only down side... It's a small place and get be busy at peak eating hours."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. I lived in Vegas from 2006 - 2008 and that was my weekly Saturday go to lunch spot. Every time I go back to Vegas, i must stop in. Peter (the owner) is always friendly and loves to feed me. This food is authentically Greek as it gets. Feels like my grandmother is there cooking for me. I never really liked the \"quick service\" plastic plates here, because I feel it cheapens the food. Their food deserves fine china. I love it and my wife couldn't stop talking about the salad dressing (this was her first visit). They always do it right. A must eat for a trip to the West side of Vegas...."}
{"text":"So delish, Jeff was friendly and greeted me and introduced himself right away. This place was recommended to me and  I read their great  reviews and had to try it, even though Mad Greek was a block away from where I was and I knew they wouldn't let me down.  well.......I'm soooo glad I tried Yassou!!!  I too recommend you give it a try, it's great food, affordable, clean and they're all friendly."}
{"text":"Simply the best fast Greek food, and some of the best food overall, that I've had in my 49 years in Las Vegas.  'Nuff said. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale:  94."}
{"text":"If you like real authentic Greek food, this is the place. My recommendation would be the chicken and gyro soulvaki. My all time favorite here. They also make the baklava fresh and in house. I cant wait to come back here. Christian and his father are dedicated to this family business and serving the community they live in. Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Authentic, and delicious. There is a huge selection and everything you might want is represented. They even have pastitio, which I rarely find, and it is absolutely delicious. All of the souvlaki selections are tasty and the portions are HUGE. Even the rice is fantastic. The food is consistent and made pretty quickly despite being extremely busy at all times. I'm serious. If you like Greek food....come here."}
{"text":"My favorite greek food restaurant in Las Vegas! They have the best gyro meet in town! Everything is fresh!  They always include feta cheese too.  It's locally owned and the people who work here are very nice!   The only downside is it only works til 8pm. I wish they worked til at least 9 and may be til 10pm Fri and Sat night.   But always stop by here for lunch any time I'm in this part of town!"}
{"text":"I would of gave it more stars the reason why is because they should of stayed open later than 8:00pm!! Why not 9pm or 10pm?? They are making money why not stay open much later!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth it!  First time I tried this place was by accident while looking for a place to eat.  All I can say is the food is just awesome!  I live in Las Vegas now and I practically come here once or twice a month.  The customer service is great as well.  If you get a chance, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Forever my favorite Greek restaurant in town. I've tried to venture off and find somewhere closer and although they've been good, it's not the same! The chicken souvlaki plate is the best!! 2 skewers of grilled chicken and onion, seasoned and marinated perfectly served with rice, a salad and pita. I love their Italian dressing and tzatziki sauce also. The owner is here pretty much everyday, very friendly gentleman and remembers his repeat customers! Trust me, if you want some good Greek, this will surpass your expectations."}
{"text":"Delicious. This place is NON-STOP busy, I knew it had to be worth trying. I'm so glad I have found a GOOD genuine Greek spot in this city!  Go! You won't regret it. The owner is a good man. It was obvious how much his business means to him.  So good!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly but the good unfortunately just wasn't that great...the servings were large and part of it was fresh... but it just wasn't great...they microwaved the soup, and didn't have the heat on the meat... they just shaved it off and tossed it on the grill,so it didn't get hot...overall kind of disappointing"}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch. I was craving for some salad and yelp gave me this address. The servings are huge. Staff are very friendly and efficient. They cook your food as you order which is not a big deal since they do it very fast. They have plenty of tables inside and outside. The place is good for groups, for family, dates, kids, or just by yourself. Lunch time here is pretty busy. The restaurant is busy with to go orders and people that are eating inside the restaurant. As busy as it gets, they don't forget your order and it should be in your table after 20-35 mins. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Good food. If you order a gyro (I always do!) you might want to ask for sauce on the side otherwise they just put a little bit right on top. Besides that it's always been awesome!"}
{"text":"For the most part, the flavors are good; but I prefer the Great Greek. The size of their gyros are much bigger than the big fat gyro. I would visit them again if I'm on that side of town, but it's something I would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food after i finaly got it. Not a very friendly restaurant thoe, watched as an older grey curly haired man was yelling at the employees. Not the way I want to enjoy my dinner."}
{"text":"Best Greek fast food in town. It's so perfect. Their yellow rice is the perfect comfort food, as is there spanakopita and saganaki. Perfection."}
{"text":"We shared hummus, chicken souvlaki, and the best rice pilaf I've tasted. Service was friendly and quick. Not a fancy place, but for great food at reasonable prices this hit the spot. 5/5 for the rice and hummus alone, it's good enough we're grabbing some baklava for the road."}
{"text":"We stopped in a few times and we always enjoyed our meal...its nothing too fancy, but real good flavors and huge plates that make your tastebuds happy :) Mmm..."}
{"text":"Best Greek in Las Vegas!  Possibly the best Greek food I've ever had!  Went for the chicken skewers lunch special and it doesn't get any better that. Went back for dinner and was just as good.  Worth the 30 minute drive each way!"}
{"text":"I have to say that Yassou is THE BEST in the business. Coming from the east coast and from a Greek family...this place has been my salvation. I cannot rave about it enough. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely my go to for Greek food.  I get the gyro plate which comes with rice, pita and salad.  They let me substitute my salad out for more pita, which I love.  The pita is always soft and the rice is so perfectly cooked and flavorful.  I've brought many people here with me and every single person has always wanted to come back again and again.  I highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that if you want to split a meal (because the portions are huge) with someone they charge you and additional dollar for a styrofoam plate and fork."}
{"text":"my favorite greek food in vegas, also very friendly staff & clean eat-in area. win/win. highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best Greek food in Las Vegas...even better than Greek food I use to get In NYC!"}
{"text":"Came in today and got Awesome food ! Really love the way they cook everything and the Greek fries are the best ! They can get understaffed sometimes, but overall the food makes up for everything. If it wasn't for my 30 minute break I could easily stay here and enjoy my food and willing to wait for my food! Great place!"}
{"text":"The food is good however, I took my out of town family there and we wanted to order a Gyro  filled with just lamb and the proprietor said they cannot fulfill that request. The Gyro has to be   mixed with beef. I did not understand what the big deal was, It is a Greek restaurant and   Gyros are usually filled with Lamb. A good restaurant should accommodate its customers  Because we pay the bills. I decided not to ever return and not give Yassou my business."}
{"text":"Love it here! They always treat me like family. Their skewers are so good that I have a hard time ordering anything else. Everyone that I send here always raves about it. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Yum. Great Greek. This is a casual dining spot, but the flavors and the well prepared meals make you feel as if you're at an upscale Greek place if there is such a thing. I love the chicken-lamb kabob plate. The place is one of my favs and that's no easy feat considering how picky I am."}
{"text":"I don't usually review places...but this place deserves 5 stars!!! Great food, awesome friendly staff! I live close by and come here often! Several times they have brought us free hummus and bread! I bring all of my out of town guests here!!"}
{"text":"Great food and this coming from someone who normally will opt out of eating Greek food."}
{"text":"Got the spanakopita and a basic gyro. Both were really good but not the best I've had. The staff was nice and then place was very clean.   Despite not being the best, the spanakopita was pretty damn good. I once had the ultimate spanakopita at a fair and have been on a hunt to find one that compares ever since. I've run into some really narly ones while on this quest. Let me tell you, Yassou's spanakopita is not one of those. Probably the best I've had aside from them legendary one.   My only complaint is the sauce and neat were kind of pushed towards one side of these gyro."}
{"text":"Okay, this became my very favorite lunch time spot because my office is (somewhat) close by and THE FOOD IS SO AMAZING. TOP NOTCH, FRESH CRUNCHY VEGTABLES in my salad, the most amazing dressing for the LEMON CHICKEN SALAD, literally it is to-die for. I had Given a bad review for this spot in the past because I was irritated with the system. I would call in my order from work, as i would never have time to wait in line, but then sometimes I would get here at prime lunch time rush hour and have to stand in the endless line just to pay. After I left the review, they entirely made up for this and tweaked the system, and would then allow me to run to the front of the line to make my payment and dash out with my lunch just in time to get back to work on time. THEY SAW MY (kind of rude) REVIEW AND MADE A CHANGE IN THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Jeez. Again, top notch, top of the line kind of place right here. thank you, and I love your food, Yassou is da bomb."}
{"text":"I am, by no means, an expert or an avid fan of Greek food so it was an adventure for my mom & I to come here. We certainly do not regret it because we had a fabulous meal together at Yassou!  Customer service was great. Friendly people behind the counter, especially (I'm assuming) one of the owners who served us, asked how our food was and bid us goodbye on our way out.   The food is delicious. My mom had the Tuna Mykonos Pita, I had the Super Lemon Herb Steak Pita & we shared the Greek Fries. Mom loved her super chunky, lemony albacore tuna pita with tomatoes and onions and the magical sauce. Lol. I also had the same condiments and veggies but mine came with seasoned, tender steak bites. The herb and feta cheese-topped fries were crispy and were a great pair to our pitas.  The ambiance of the place is casual and I would expect it to be super packed around rush hour cause it's not a very huge place. I must say too that the place is warm inside, we were a bit sweating while eating our food even when sitting in a shaded table so that was a little uncomfortable. All in all though, we are definitely coming back to try the Gyro and the Rice plates since everyone is raving about them!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service gives this little gem a 5-Star rating. Being a picky eater it is always a plus for me when the restaurant can tell me what is going to be on my order and hold certain items from it. I know it sounds very basic but you would be surprised at how many places can't do that. While we tried several of their dishes I have to admit my favorite was their house Gyro. If your in the area and looking for something a bit different you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Great place great food. My family said they loved the food and they wanted to come back very soon. The price is extremely reasonable. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after seeing some great reviews and being the closest Greek restaurant near me. When I walked into Yassou, I was greeted by Greek music and a bunch of Greek memorabilia on the wall. I love that kind of stuff and made me wish I was still in Greece.  I ordered the moussaka and it came with a Greek salad, tzatziki, rice, and pita slices. The moussaka had a huge crispy layer of bechamel at the top, but just a little too much for my liking. It tasted great though. The rice was cooked well and was seasoned great.  The pita was good and I love tzatziki no matter what. Everything to cooked for order and the service was very quick.  I will definitely be back in the future to try some different dishes!"}
{"text":"The best greek food in Las Vegas!!! I just moved to Nashville and I'm slightly upset they dont have a Yassou's out there. Whenever I come back to town, you better believe I'm stopping by."}
{"text":"I am a freak for greek food and I had heard from my co-workers that this was a great place. Being that it is right down the street from work, I decided to try it out today. I took an early lunch and showed up and there is already a line to the door. Good sign. I ordered a greek salad with gyro and lemon chicken to go. It took close to 30 minutes to come out. I understand that they were swamped, but if it's like that everyday I suggest hiring more than one person to take orders and run orders and have more than two people in the kitchen. Highlight was that the salad was amazing. I will be back, but I will likely call in my order next time so I don't have to wait so long."}
{"text":"Decent. Open daily.   Very nice workers. Seems to be maybe family owned?   Came mid-day (around 4pm) - they had a lot of chairs flipped on tables to clean (between lunch and dinner time i guess where its not so busy.. still weird) While i was eating, they were cleaning around the restaurant. Upon entrance to the restaurant, almost had the feeling they were closing soon ! i had to double check the hours on the front XD !   I had ordered a steak and gyro plate. The rice was not that good. Steak was over-cooked and dry. Gyro meat was good but didnt make up for the previous too because it didnt really have any accompanyment to eat together with. Another sad thing was the pita bread couldnt be opened to make pockets for me to stuff and eat like i can at other Mediterranean/greek places."}
{"text":"I always come here for a quick lunch. Fast service and the food is good. My son always asks me to come here after school. He loves the big fat Greek gyro and the hummus plate. The gyro is seasoned well, the pita is soft and velvety and the hummus is creamy. It's always delicious however for the first time I ordered a baklava and that is a zero star. I have never seen a baklava as crumbly as this one. The taste is bland and stale. I will definitely never order again. We ended up tossing it away."}
{"text":"Yassou is not only the best Greek food but the best food PERIOD. I've come to this restaurant A LOT of times and they have been nothing but courteous, fast and efficient. To top it off the food is always the best, every time I go its like the first time going all over again. Love Yassou, I will be back again and again"}
{"text":"It was nothing crazy. Nice lil family operated restaurant. Reminds me too much of my own family...."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time we are in Vegas, we try to drop by. I brought my family here, I brought my friend here and everyone loved it. The only gripe, this past weekend, they were out of teramasalata."}
{"text":"Working is Vegas this week. Stopped by this place for lunch. I got the \"My Big Fat Gyro\" lunch deal--gyro, fries and a soft drink. Ouch, $11+ wasn't so much of a deal. Nevertheless, the gyro was tasty. Pita bread was soft and fresh. Meat was tender and flavorful. Big basket of Greek fries that I couldn't finish.  The fellow running the place seemed friendly. The place was certainly hopping at lunchtime. The soda dispenser is self-serve, and I made sure I got my fill of refills, since the lunch was just a tad pricey.  Certainly not the worst Greek I ever ate. Would I eat here again? You betcha."}
{"text":"Had super high expectations based on the reviews, but food was bland, service was terrible, and we took our food to go and they forgot the grape leaves-the whole reason I got the veggie spreads plate!  Not cool!  Won't return."}
{"text":"Great food at great price, service though is a bit lacking. The Mini Souvlaki plate was really good chicken and beef were tender  and savory. The Salads are pretty good as well. A good healthy alternative although i would recommend getting the order as a take out instead of dine in. The front of the house is understaffed food on the other hand was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was good. Not great. Liked their salsa bar, ehich included a mango salsa that was really fresh and tasty. I went here a few weeks ago and check in. Just now dojng the review. Didn't take a photo and trying to remember what I even ordered. The restaurant had a cool bar in the back. I think they just need to do a good cleaning from top to bottom. Floors were not clean. Wonder what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the food is always fresh and consistent in flavor. The portions are good for the price. I usually get the combo plates. Friendly service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food most amazing.  Officially my new spot for Greek desires, have tried other places and this one deff tops."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times, and I love this place. But, today I was really hungry for My Big Fat Gyro sandwich. The top of my gyro sandwich was really delicious then I got to the bottom of my sandwich, the meats were dried and partially burned. I was very, very disappointed!!       I hope my next visit, it will be better!!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with my husband. The short, tan, Asian cashier with the long black hair told me that I look \"MISERABLE\" while we were ordering food. I am assuming that she said that because I am pregnant?!? I was so outraged but I managed to control my shock and keep my composure. It really hurt my feelings to hear that because I am already self-conscious enough from the baby weight. That was sooo rude of her. She looks like a pathetic ugly old troll but unlike her I wouldn't just straight up tell her that! We came here to eat food, not get insulted!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times within a week. It is that good.  The Mini Souvlaki needs to have its name changed. It should be called \"Perfect Souvlaki\" because the portioning is perfect, and the food is perfect.  It's been only a month since I've moved to Vegas, and it's restaurants like this that make it easy for me to call a new city home."}
{"text":"Excelllent place! I have been here several times. My wife and I keep coming back. Try the Super Lemon Chicken Pita! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Hard to beat the food at this place.  The prices are great and the portions huge.  The environment is homey and inviting.  A great spot for lunch.  Try the chicken lemon soup, I hear it's great!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Like, really delicious! I've done both take-out and eat-in here, with good experiences both times. The dining area has great natural light, and a good atmosphere, though the greek carnival-sounding music was a little louder than necessary when I was there. I docked a star because there were ants crawling around in the bathroom and in the secondary dining area. Perhaps that was a temporary issue, but it raises concerns about cleanliness."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the BEST LAMB CHOPS I have ever tasted.  My plate was overflowing.  There is such a personal touch from this single owner business.  I will always go back as everything is always fresh and delicious.  Donna D."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite. The gyro was fine, nothing to get too crazy about. The veggies on the gyro were fresh so they get a thumbs up for that. The Greek fries were slightly disappointing as there was only one tiny piece of feta cheese. I would give it another shot in the future based on the fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Their Food is Great and the father and son that run the restaurant are great too. Everything is always fresh and good. I have a special interest because the son got married through my dating service (Interactions Dating). So Yassou keep up the great food.                                                              Elaine"}
{"text":"All I can say is freshness is key. I just love love love it here. Everything is prepared so neatly and nicely. Tastes great and the employees are amazing."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere! This is my favorite seat in Greek place hands down! I usually get the gyro salad or plate and am never disappointed. I also never leave hungry, if anything I have left overs or another snack or meal. The desserts are as good as the gyro meats, if not better!"}
{"text":"BEST GREEK FOOD EVER!!! I go here quite often, and the customer service is always awesome, even when it's packed. The chicken pita with the greek fries are my go to. The atmosphere is really cool too. I wish I could give it six stars."}
{"text":"Favorite  greek place in town! Great food .Good service and the owners are very friendly. We go often!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Yassou for at least 10 years and have always loved it (and still do). However if today were our first visit I am not sure how we would have felt. First things first the cashier (I believe her name is Sara) was somewhat rude. When she informed my wife that the red caviar spread was not available she rushed my wife on making a decision on which sauce she wanted extra of. This may have been acceptable if there was a line but we were the only ones ordering. Christian was working hard on the line so I am not sure if he was aware of the shape that the restaurant was in, once again if this was our first time we would have a really bad perception of Yassou.  During our dinner there was another woman cleaning, not a bad thing but the mop water was so strong with bleach that it somewhat interfered with our meal. There were two couples that came in after us and each had a less than stellar experience. The older couple seemed to be almost harassed for asking for an extra plate while the young family seemed to get attitude for requesting the fries and pita they ordered.   We have been avid visitors of Yassou and have recommended it over the other Greek restaurants in town so it was sad to see today be so off. Christian and his family work hard to make it a great experience and I commend him for having such an authentic and delicious restaurant. Maybe there was something in the air or everyone was just way over stressed but today was really just not a good day at Yassou. I really hope stuff like this doesn't end up hurting them as it is our favorite Greek place in town."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places in town.  I have been here on a couple of different lunch outings.  We may sit in different seats every time we dine at YGGC but the one thing that never changes is the friendly service AND the super tasty, fresh chow.  The veggies are crispy, the meat is succulent (first time typing that word, thank you spell check!).  Beware the parking can be a bit insane depending on when you eat.  Remember if you have to eat fries, eat the Greek fries."}
{"text":"So amazing not gonna lie just orgasmed in my mouth eating this place.. I'm definitely coming back to this place best Greek place in town by far"}
{"text":"We found his place on Yelp, and will never order a Gyro from another place in Vegas as long as we live here!   The first time we came here, the owner was super friendly- even gave us a couple pieces of meat to sample. We ended up each getting a platter combo each (I got chicken, he got steak) but it ended up being too much food for us. All the meats they serve here are amazing, and but what really blew the meal out of the water was the rice pilaf!!   Since our first visit, my boyfriend and I have since come up with our regular order; we each get a Yassou Gyro, an order of rice to share, a couple sodas, and extra tzatziki sauce. The only thing that would make this place better is if they put more tzatziki sauce in the rear of the Gyros, usually it's all up front so when you start unwrapping the tail end, it gets dry. :("}
{"text":"Good food, close to my house. The food has never been bad, and most plates they serve are more than I can eat.  Unfortunately, the parking sucks, and getting to the location is very inconvenient. So while they are the place I think of when I desire Greek food, I don't mind finding an excuse to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago, and our Las Vegas friends met us here for a quick dinner.  Gyro meat is authentic and as good as we have in Chicago.  The steak souvlaki was tender and flavorful.  Everything was authentic Greek food.  Restaurant is very casual, we sat in the covered patio and it's off a busy street, but fenced and private.  They put a lot of effort into their restaurant and it shows.  Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"It's been hard to find a good Greek restaurant here in the valley....finally found it!!!so good. Meat is cooked but still juice and tender. Great customer service too"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food! Hands down my new favorite Greek food go to! The chicken is cooked beautifully and has great flavor. Even my 2 year old ate an entire skewer of chicken!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek fast food.  The gyros and chicken souvlaki (kabob) are a good tasty combo. The place could be a bit more inviting inside and the orders done a little faster but the food itself makes up for all that.  I go back when I get a chance and nearby!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's the only Greek place in town that I have found is quick and easy and cheap. As for taste, no it's probably not the best I have ever had, but for me, I order the chicken souvlaki plate or greek salad with chicken and I am happy with it consistently. The pita on the salad is very buttery and I believe fried, so not exactly the healthiest, but good. The dressing is excellent and I always ask for it on the side since they tend to go heavy on the dressing. It somehow always seems to be mixed in every time, but when I ask them about it, they say it's the marinade from the chicken that gives it that taste or feel that the dressing was still mixed it, but they say it wasn't. The people working there know us by face now and it always seems to be the same people working, I know the owner is always there, but the other guy might be his son? He is always there too.   The chicken and rice soup is really yummy but sometimes they don't have it, especially over the summer. My hubby orders the steak skewers or gyro and isn't as impressed with this place as I am. Friendly workers, quick food, and affordable is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have ever had. Will be back many more times. Suggest the souvlaki combo as it is a perfect mixture and shows how good the chicken and beef is."}
{"text":"Today I had this craving for Greek Cusine. My sister and I headed on over to Yassou Greek Grill Cafe. I ordered the Gyro Beef & Lamb pita sandwich for which I was very pleased. The cashier was very friendly. The restuarant was very clean. The best $7.00 dollars I ever spent"}
{"text":"This is a great Greek casual dining restaurant. It has all the favorites and it is family owned.   They have great meat and kabobs. I specially like the Greek pizza with yummy calamata olives.   They have a enclosed patio area and a open air one.   They do take their time so if your in a hurry order ahead."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for more than 10 years. The food is fantastic and the staff is friendly. We love the gyros and Greek fries. My favorite is the Spanakopita plate."}
{"text":"I got the gyros plate and it's delicious! Service is fast and it's a fun Greek atmosphere. Must go!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and food is ALWAYS good! I've been coming here for years and it has never let me down! The best Greek food in town!"}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent!!!  Love their Gyros!!!  Their service is as great as their food!!"}
{"text":"Decent Gyro sandwich compared to others I've tried in Las Vegas.  I am taking off one star because of the little amount of Tzatziki sauce that was on the lettuce and didn't make it into the sandwich and when I asked for extra side of sauce, they wanted to charge 55 cents for a little container.   It's not the money, and fine charge extra for additional sauce, but try putting on a decent amount on the sandwich in the first place.  Other than that I did enjoy it and would probably go back."}
{"text":"Yassou has been my go-to place for greek food for over 7 years now!  Food is flavorful and staff is friendly. I always get the Super lemon chicken gyro and my husband gets the My Big Fat Greek Gyro with greek fries...so good!"}
{"text":"Yassou is my favorite Greek spot to dine in with super reasonable prices. I have tried many Greek joints in Las Vegas and Reno and it is by far the best. Their workers are always really nice and engaging.   I have dined in and gotten take out with both experiences being quick and efficient. My favorites to get are the chicken + steak souvlaki combo and the lemon herb chicken pita. I get the souvlaki combo when I want pita bread and their amazing rice pilaf (best rice pilaf I've ever had by the way). I get the lemon herb chicken pita when I'm craving that flavorful ultra juicy chicken. The chicken pita comes with an extra container of juice, like OKAY I SEE YOU YASSOU!! Serving the extra juices as if it's not ridiculously juicy enough. On top of that, the price point is really good for the large portions they give you.  Yassou never fails to deliver amazing food while still being pretty healthy!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Greek food I've ever had. We even had them cater our wedding last year. I have yet to find anything on their menu I don't like. Friendly, delicious and a great place to relax. Perfect first date location."}
{"text":"This is near my doctors office. I ordered some food but I noticed they do not have their grade from the health department up. I saw something near the drinks that said health permit but not hanging up it was just sitting down on the counter. A worker looked at me kind of nervously when he saw I was looking in that direction (of the permit.) I like to see letter grades and don't like to see worried workers. However the salad I had was good. I also ordered a soup that took like ten min to come out but I asked and they apologized and gave me a free baklava. The food tasted good I just hope to see they put the grade up on the wall soon!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place (pretty much every week). They are extremely consistent, and their super mini combo for lunch is truly delicious. For a nice takeout type Greek place this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"I catered an office lunch yesterday for 15. The food was on time and hot, prepared well with a full set up of plates and serving utensils. Staff was pleasant to work with. Everyone loved the variety and the generous portions."}
{"text":"Decent quantity and quality. Combo plates offer a very good deal. Steak was nicely marinated and tender. The gyro meat was terrific. It's cooked on the skewer and shaved as is proper. This is not a flat top grilled gyro. Thank the Greek gods for that. Limitations in my opinion are seating options."}
{"text":"Immaculately clean to go along with the outstanding food and fast service. Family owned and operated and it shows in how everyone shows ownership of the place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I ordered the gyro-spanakopita plate and it comes with so much food I had to divide it into two meals! My husband ordered the spanakopita plate and an order of dolmades (stuffed grape leaves with ground beef) OMG! They serve them with this lemon sauce that is so delicious.  The service is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. And the ONLY reason they did not get 5 stars is because of the same small, simple thing that happens quite too often. I eat here AT LEAST twice a month of not more (sometimes once a wk)  and I pay EXTRA for extra sauce, and 85% of the time my EXTRA sauce that I PAID for is missing. It's already bad if an eatery forgets the sauce that comes with your meal, but for a sauce that is PAID for by yourself wether if it's 50 cents or $5, you, we, PAID for it. Please don't leave that out!!! I'm such a pushover and HATE complaining and esp over a $1 sauce. But hey, that's A DOLLAR (or whatever the amount is.) Other than that, the food is amazing and soooo good that I choose to come back. Plus I tried quite a few other Greek places and they are not nearly as good as here. I just wish they'd be a little more attentive to these \"small\" big things"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and excellent service! The gyro meat was so moist and the hummus was great! Best bakalava around! I will def be coming back and recommend you try it. The people who were working were very welcoming."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Greek place in town. The lemon chicken & gyro salad is so delicious and refreshing. My kid loves their pizza. My husband DESTROYS the Big Fat Gyro... sooo good. Hummus side is a must. Today I tried  the big fat and totally get why the hubs likes it so much. Their fries are bomb. Calamari plate is delicious. This place is one of our staples for lunch and dinner. The owner is so incredibly nice and authentic. He is always there and you can tell he takes such pride in the restaurant he has truly made AMAZING. We've probably been to this place 30 times over the years, and each time has been a wonderful experience. If you are a Vegas local and haven't gone... you are majorly missing out. Just sayin. We are BIG FANS if you couldn't tell."}
{"text":"Some people say \"I'm not a Chef but I know what I like... Well I was a Chef and I really like Yassou Greek Grill Cafe! My wife and I eat out all over town 3-5 meals a week. We may have become spoiled a little. So when I say to my wife \"Let's Eat Greek\" I know she will just look up and say \"Yassou\"    Ika"}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek food we have ever tasted.  It's our new favorite spot. The people are so friendly and it feels inviting   I love their Greek pizza.  My husband eats the youri and chicken plate.  I give this place 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and was hoping it would be good..Nope..Just not close to my standards..I ate half and chucked the other half when I realized just how lousy the food was.."}
{"text":"OMG! Being a Greek has its privileges. Understanding Yassous to be like Gramma's homemade Greek food is one of them. The Dolmades (warm with meat) are to die for. The only bad thing about Yassous, is trying to decide what I want each time. The Spanakopita, Moussaka, Pastitsio, or the Big Fat....awesome stuff!!"}
{"text":"Regular customer for several years.  I have to say the food is consistently delicious.  The fresh dolmades are excellent, best in town hands down.  Everyone is always friendly and helpful.  I've tried several other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants but Yassou's tops them all!  Worth the $, the quality of the food + large portions are totally worth their prices."}
{"text":"One of my professors recommended this place during a conversation about places to eat around.  The location was easy enough to find. I ended up parking in the McDonalds parking lot and walking next door. The decor is very nice with a few tables outside for outdoor dining during the warmer months.  Greek Fries Standard fries with feta cheese and some chopped parsley. Given the price difference between Greek fries and American fries being 50cents more i would have gotten the standard fries. There just wasnt enough feta or herbs to enhance the fries and make them tastes different or Greek for that matter.  Chicken Souvalaki Overall excellent, the side salad was fresh and crispy, could have done with a few more olives. The Pita bread is EXCELLENT soft and chewy very nice texture. Excellent rice pilaf, buttery with a fresh lemonly taste. Chicken was cooked to perfection, nicely flavored and still juicy in the middle.  I would highly recommend this place to others and will definately come back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened. This is an amazing little cafe. Food is always good. It's not fast food. But it is fantastic food. It's worth waiting for your order to come up. If you are in a hurry and want to take it to go call ahead.   Peter and his crew are always on the move."}
{"text":"Who can say no to some yummy greek food? Lemond herb and gyro platter and a sode of hunmous ooooooooweeeeeeh so delicious! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Yassou is one of the best places I have been to here in Las Vegas. It is hands down the best Greek spot I have eaten at. The place is very spacious. Staff is friendly. Lots of options to choose from they even have a vegetarian menu. My wife and kids loved and because they at everything usually when we go eat the just pick at it but they at everything because the food is so flavorful every last bite of it."}
{"text":"All I have had here is the Greek Salad and the Greek Fries.  With that said, let me tell you how much I love both these items....together...one on top of the other!  It is a marriage made in heaven and before a big test I must have this for comfort!  Will return after the stress of nursing school has left my life to try a Gyro that I have seen in many reviews :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I was introduced to  Yassou through friends and am so glad I was! Their chicken lunch special can't be beat. One chicken skewer (seasoned and cooked perfectly), rice, side salad (with the best Greek dressing ever) and pita bread w/ a side of tzatziki, all for less than $10. If you're feeling extra hungry, order the Greek fries - you won't be disappointed. Fries with feta, parsley, and I believe a squeeze of lemon (?). Yummy!  Be prepared because they do get very busy during lunchtime, but it's worth it!  They are family owned and nice people. They also own the dry cleaner in the same strip mall (super reasonable prices) so you can kill two birds with one stone!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I ate there on a weekly basis at one point. Food is delicious, fresh, and consistent. Only gripe is tables were always dirty - it is pretty casual, but if in-n-out can keep their tables clean, I think this place can handle their 10 tables a little better. Obviously, the food is so good it did not deter us from coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm not fluent in Greek, but I'm pretty sure Yassou means \"delicious food\". Found this place on Yelp and bookmarked it, then heard from my BF that it was an old favorite place of his, so naturally we went by our first full day in town.  The lunch specials are well-priced and delicious- for $10/each we got a gyro (the big fat for him, the lemon chicken special for me), with greek fries and a drink. Not bad at all, and portions are huge. Price for value is excellent.  Both gyros were delish, but i'm more a fan of the traditional gyro meat rather than the chicken, though it was good to see a healthier option on the menu. Worth a try, at the very least. Greek fries are the bomb- regular fries with feta, and maybe some garlic?, and parsley. Delicious. And for a take out order, they are carefully wrapped so as not to displace any of the plentiful crumbly cheese. Smart thinking!  Love how the owner himself is working alongside the employees to make and fill the orders- great sign and also underscores the quality you can expect here."}
{"text":"Good environment. Love the Greek Fries. I haven't had much else. Also it's a Pokestop!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food I have ever had.  Authentic feel, friendly service.  I would make a recommendation of what to get, but it is all amazing and made to order!!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wanted greek food today, had to go get it.    The MIni Souvlaki Special includes a chicken skewer, minus the beef skewer (I had enough beef this week), yellow rice pilaf, pita bread, small greek salad, and tzatziki.  This was the best greek food I have ever tasted.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the salad was fresh with fluffy feta cheese, and the bread was warm and soft.  If you want great greek food, this place is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Good food good environment, went around 2 pm they weren't busy but it took 25 minutes to get our food. The people who ordered right in front of us (same items) got their food 15 minutes sooner.  I will go back again I just hope the food doesn't take as long to arrive. Without the wait I would give 4 stars."}
{"text":"This was pretty good. Prices low and a good spot to go for Greek food. The portions were large enough to take some home for later. The Greek fries were excellent! Yum ! Will go again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fair prices. It's hard to find a good Greek restaurant, but we've finally found it and that's yassou. All the meat tastes fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas.. never a disappointment and the owner is always soo friendly"}
{"text":"Yum! So glad I live close to this little gem. The gyro meat is some of the best I have had. It was flavorful and moist, and the tzatziki sauce was on point. I chose the chicken souvlaki and gyro meat plate it was around $12. It came with a small salad, rice and warm pita. I didn't care too much for the rice, but not because it was bad, just because I am not a fan of that style of rice. The owner was welcoming and friendly, and I appreciate that he helped out in the kitchen when it got busy to get the orders out quicker.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the other items on the menu.  Yelp 2015 Review #27"}
{"text":"Have been obsessed with Greek/Mediterranean food for about 2 years now and this place is the best I've tried so far. Even beating out bigger chains like Luna Grill in California, whom I do love when im in town but if there was a Yassou in Cali I'd never step foot in a Luna Grill again. Not only are their plates mouth watering but the portions are large and very fairly priced. Large portions, financially savvy, and healthy?? It'd be irresponsible NOT to eat here! 5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"Huge portions, reasonable prices, and it tastes good? What more can you ask for.   I ordered a Greek salad with beef and lamb gyro on top. It was so delicious! My two complaints were that the olives not being pitted. I almost broke my tooth biting into it. My other complaint was that they charged $.50 for some gyro sauce. Which I think should come with it since it kinda was a gyro salad.   My girlfriend ordered a plate and it came with so much food! I loved the pita bread they have here because it's so soft and fluffy! How I like my bread.   Can't wait to come back and try their actual gyros!"}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff!!! The hummus and pita bread is to die for! :) Would absolutely be back to this amazing Greek establishment!"}
{"text":"I just ate at this restaurant. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat which was excellent. What I really enjoyed about the restaurant is in addition to good food, there's a very pretty patio to sit outside. We were lucky to have great weather so it was a very enjoyable experience. The owner came by and spoke to us and was very friendly. All in all its going to be a very refreshing new place to go to.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek food in Lv. Great atmosphere! I have come here 5 times in the last month. Im hooked on great food and above and beyond great service. All the staff are awsome!!! And also all the customers that patronage the place makes it feel like one big happy greek family!. All smiles here w this place. O ya it always seems to be full when i go so expect to wait 15 min give or take for food to come out."}
{"text":"Yassou was delicious!  I ordered the chicken pita - juicy lemon herb chicken, veggies and just the right amount of tzatziki.   Loved it.  Also ordered a side of the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Unlike most places that serve the oily canned meatless variety, these are homemade with ground beef.  It was odd though - in some, the meat was juicy and in others it was dry and crumbly.  Obviously I preferred the juicy ones, but they were hit and miss.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Great place."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner there last night.  We each ordered the big gyro with Greek fries.  The food was really good and the portions were generous.  The staff was very attentive and the restaurant was remarkably clean.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Woke up in the middle of the night craving a nice gyro.... Hmmmmm the feta cheese and yassou takes pride in the Quality..."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Food does seem to be bland. My Greek fries seriously had 3 pieces of feta. The beef lamb was also bland. The staff was nice. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place, and I am glad I did. Came in for lunch  with some work buddies. Really fresh, and we'll priced. I ordered the lemon steak gyro, and some french fries. The gyro was the best I have ever had. The steak was cooked well, and very flavorful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! We've driven by many times and always wanted to stop in and today we did! Greek music playing lively bouzouki, the wonderful smells of fresh food cooking and greetings from the staff. The place was hopping with a lunchtime buzz! We had a great meal that arrived in a timely manner and served by a friendly young man. So much food we took some back home with us. On our way out we stopped to refill our drinks and we were graciously thanked by the owner and invited back! What a great place!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Michigan near Detroit Greek town I was spoiled with amazing Greek food. Whenever I'm craving a gyro I come here to Yassous it's pretty good not quite Michigan Greek town good but it's pretty close. Service is excellent greeted right away by the guy that runs the place and he checked on everyone to make sure everything was good! Def my go to place for some chicken souvlaki & gyro"}
{"text":"Best gyro in town! Can't go wrong with the spanakopita and gyro plate. Excellent portion size and the dressing for the salad is amazing. Would recommended this place to everyone. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"A solid place for Greek comfort food in a casual cafe-meets-deli atmosphere.  Everything we had was delicious and served promptly.  My lemon-herb chicken pita went down very easily: savoury and herby and all-round yummy.  Hubby had a veggie combo with dolmades, spanikopita, etc. and enjoyed each bite.  Major points for food deliciousness but a star taken off for dirty floors and slightly sticky tables!  (I've made those comments about other places....broken record? or just over-observant clean freak?)  Staff was not as friendly as I expected them to be, but I'm still giving 4* because the food was great."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been driving by this place for years and never stopped in! My husband and I just dropped by for a gyro and it was as good as it gets. We love gyros and tzatziki and Yassou's didn't disappoint. The Greek fries just tasted like regular fries, so I probably wouldn't pay extra for them next time. We also tried the baklava which was very rich and sweet in a light syrup. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Las Vegas. Everything is so fresh. Their Greek fries are delicious."}
{"text":"It's quite a hike from the airport/strip. Wasn't bad at all but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Love the chicken skewer plate, cute little lunch spot for me and my family, friendly service, but really... What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place was delicious and Chris the owner was a super cool dude too. Definitely five stars on the service food and cleanliness. They have inside and outside dining"}
{"text":"They have the best Greek food ever!! Reasonable prices, I come here every couple weeks and the staff is great. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoy Greek food"}
{"text":"A gem in the Section 10 neighborhood. Very reasonably-priced all-day \"lunch\" plates/specials, and a very neighborhood feel. The owner/manager is always there and more than happy to make sure you have everything you need to grab a good, home-cooked Mediterranean meal.  You can't ask for much more than that.   Hot sauce options are slight - you've basically got a big community bottle of Cholula that you might have to \"borrow\" from one of the other diners. If that's a dealbreaker, just bring your own potion and keep it secret. :) I'm gonna next time I go. Cholula is just not hot to my seared 'buds. But that's my problem, I guess!"}
{"text":"Big fat gyros, Greek salad and baklava were all wonderful! Would do the 10 mile drive again!"}
{"text":"Not often am on that side of town. Whenever I do make it point too get my greek on! I think by far the best Greek food in Vegas. Everything on the menu is Greek heaven! I always get the gyros and spankopita! The gryos meat juicy, spot on cooked, as is the spankopita, and awesome greek salad (love the dressing, nice black greek olives, nice feta chesse, cucumbers) and rice. The price really REALLY affordable talk about food for under $10 get money worth! I tried the baklava normally never have enough room by the end. I had lunch with friends visiting decided too try much different things off the menu. Dessert was one of them. Nice. Really sweet and rich but then again that the only way I think of baklava! Music playing is authentic Greek music. You truly get that feeling of old school family (hold less then 80 people?) run restaurant. Not chain restaurant and tell the quality of the food feels like family secrets from one generation too another.   The staff is really friendly and visitors in town not normally eat greek food had questions. The server was very attentive and answered all of my friends questions.   The parking ample parking in front of the building the only thing gets me each time. I tend too miss the entrance for that little shopping complex. It tends too sneak up on you and that the only entrance for that shopping area. I had too turn around. Still for piece of Greek heaven so worth it! =)))"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food and frankly some of the best service you'll get in Las Vegas! Thank you for being affordable and consistent!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with my food from here. I usually get the super lemon-herb chicken Pita and a side of Greek fries and occasionally I'll get a side of hummus. My taste buds are screaming  from all the delicious flavors I love how fresh and flavorful the food is, and that the owner always remembers me and my boyfriend no matter how long it's been!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Greek Lemon Drop Soup for my Greek Grandma and she loved it.  We'll be back to try some more of her favorites."}
{"text":"Yassou is one of my favorite Greek places!!  Homemade rice pudding, fresh food and great service!!  I've eaten here many times and I am in love with the gyro plate!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing on the menu is the Greek fries, they come covered in lemon, seasonings, and feta. Seriously amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've tried my big fat gyro, the steak pita, and the gyro and steak souvlaki combo plate. Everything I've tried here have been insanely good. I didn't think I could finish the gyro and the pita but found myself devouring it. The gyro and steak souklaki combo plate is a huge serving. The steak was cooked perfectly. It went well with the rice pilaf and salad. The tzatziki sauce is addicting! I almost came back the next day to order it again. Customer service is friendly and excellent. An excellent choice to satisfy your Greek food craving!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for gyros. Growing up in Chicago I know what good Greek food is and sadly, Vegas is really lacking in the Greek category. Yassou's does satisfy my gyro craving though every time. The meat is always fresh and the sauce is the perfect consistency. The prices are fair as well. For the quality, definitely worth the price. I just wish it was located closer to me."}
{"text":"I was looking for mediteranean And find this place with the help of Yelp!!It was lunch time and they had lunch special the chicken was good, not a 5stars because the service was little too long  and the table outside not clean but for the price i have no regret and Yes i will go back if i am in this area of town!!"}
{"text":"You definetly get your fill for the price. The flavors here are good but not great. Definetly worth it if you have a craving for Mediterranean and dont want to fix it at home. Not bad though. Will give it another shot when I get another craving. Lol"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Nice family restaurant and amazing Greek food. We stop by every time (at least once) we're in Vegas and have shared this place with friends and family and they all love it too. Everything I've tried is great but the my big fat gyro sandwich is my go to."}
{"text":"The Yassou gyro was really good and fries w/ feta cheese were tasty. Only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because I felt the portion was small for the price."}
{"text":"This is absolute best Greek in all of VEGAS and maybe beyond. I've had friends from Chicago tell me this beats anything they have there. We use them for catering as well. Authentic and the staff is fantastic. I would eat here every day if I could. Get the Greek fries."}
{"text":"Continuously the best Greek food I've ever had. I have been here 4 times and never once had a bad meal. I think that is because this is a family run business that puts the quality of their food 1st. They also know that they are number 1 for a reason, and that's because of all their customers who continue to return for the best Greek food in Las Vegas. I know I will be back again, and again!!"}
{"text":"Thing I like most about Yassou is the lemon herb marinade/sauce that they use on several of their items.  They do this well.    Generally speaking, I'm not going to go out of my way to eat here.  I think there are better Greek/Mediterranean places at about the same price-point...and most of them are sit down places with more comfortable seating.   The gyros are solid here...they do their chicken gyros better than average...nothing else telling my stomach to tell my brain to come back here though.  I do love their black and white checkerboard tiles :)"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. Need I say more? This place rocks. Pizza for my picky son,a big fat gyro for my daughter who misses them from our trip to Greece, and for Mama a platter, really reasonable, really yummy, really fresh."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service. Too much dressing on the salad but good vibe. The chicken and gyro tasted very good.."}
{"text":"Really great Greek good!!! I am obsessed with this place! The workers are very nice and you see the owner back there working in the kitchen. It's a nice hole in the wall kind of place. I love it!"}
{"text":"I'm long overdue for a review. I've been coming here regularly for over a year, ever since I moved close by. This place is my weekly staple.  I have been known to eat here 3x a week! I have only eaten the chicken and steak souvlaki. The chicken and meat is probably the most flavorful, juicy, and tender I've had from comparable restaurants.  The Greek salad is awesome! The rice is to die for! The pita bread is so good too. This is a great family owned and run restaurant and the prices are awesome considering the amount of food and quality you get. Most plates are $8- $9. Peak lunch times you will sometimes see a line out the door.   Give this place try, you won't be disappointed. 8D"}
{"text":"This is by far the best greek restaurant in town. I'm a vegetarian so I always get the spanakopita and greek salad."}
{"text":"Had a gyro and couldn't complain about it at all. The pita was warm and chewy, the meat was seasoned well and very tender and the all veggies were fresh and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try this place again and try some new items off the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place! I always order the Gyro salad and steak souvlaki plate and eat the leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and let me tell you that these Gyros sandwich are the best. The Greek Salad or of this world and those Greek fries and cheese."}
{"text":"After dabbling a few different Greek joints, this by far is my favorite in the valley. At some point, it was a little inconsistent with the seasoning/cooking BUT that was a long ago and after coming here and giving it another chance, I must say it's 5 star quality. The workers are all nice, the food is great, the baklava is definitely something to drool over, and the overall ambiance of this place is amazing."}
{"text":"3 years later and this is the only place my husband and I go for greek food. The consistency after all these years is hard to find in resturants but they are still top notch. Nick the cook is always awesome and has been there since i started going.Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Not really that great of a place. The gyro meat isn't that great here. 60%-70% of the time it's dry or old.  The salad is put in with the rest of the food on takeout causing it to get warm and humid. Souvlaki is alright."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat Greek food but enjoyed it. Will come back and try other stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"Consistent delicious Greek food every time! The Greek steak salad is my all time fav - salads CAN be tasty and Yassou does an awesome job at that. The gyros and grilled chicken are excellent as well, and the avgolemono soup, as well as the dolmades. Love love love all the time."}
{"text":"I tried to come here for lunch, they totally forgot our order. They were super rude about it and not very helpful. But the kicker is that the chef was eating his lunch in the middle of making food. Seriously? Either he is so over worked he isn't allowed a break for eating, or he and management don't care about hygiene. Either option is not good. Will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Here's the straight forward deal on this place. If you want a gyro they're great. Makes a good tzatziki sauce. Uses Kronos gyro meat which I like better than even homemade ones I've had and they must sell enough that Pitts are fresh. However, I wouldn't get a Greek salad or any of the sides like tiramusalata etc. I ordered a few because I love all those sides. They were very disappointing. Grape leaves were so so (there is one place that has by far the best in town). I was told once a week they make their own, but the ones I had tasted like the canned ones, which are fine but not what I was hoping for in a mom and pop place. Greek food is tough in Vegas, which is why it's generally first stop when I go home. I was really hoping for better, and I'll still go back when I want a gyro because really those were excellent but if I want Greek food, I'll wait till I head out of town still."}
{"text":"The best hands down! We've tried most of the menu all amazing taste, portions, and quality. My husband and I would be in trouble if we lived near by"}
{"text":"After three one-star reviews in a row, I'm happy to add this (what's going on with the businesses in Vegas?!)  Can't get enough of this place - the food is so delicious.  And the staff is great.  I sometimes pick up food to-go to take to my guy who lives five hours away in the mountain with no Greek, no Asian, no nothing food around and they are awesome enough to fulfill my request in separating certain things to prevent sogginess/etc.  Usually order the Big Fat Gyro, or the dinner places of lamb/beef.  I've had the chicken slouvaki and that was delicious as well.  I'm going to try and make some lemon rice because their's has inspired me so much."}
{"text":"Normally I go for the chicken souvlaki plate. Super delicious and have never been disappointed. Today I decided to venture out and tried the Greek pizza with chicken. It is to die for!!! The olives really make this pizza something special."}
{"text":"Light refreshing and flavorful! Who said healthy eating should be flavorless? They really have a way with adding flavor with natural ingredients such as yogurt, parsley, lemon, etc. I'm thrilled this place is down the street from us, they are really tasty!   I ordered the super lemon herb chicken pita. It was a nice big freshly homemade pita stuffed silly with grilled lemon herb chicken and lettuce, also dolloped with a good amount of their creamy yogurt sauce. Squirt some lemon on that baby and eat to your heart's content. It is really refreshing and flavorful! I was completely satisfied and I also didn't feel guilty or overstuffed. Just perfect!   My boyfriend ordered the steak souvlaki combo which comes with a side of greek salad and also rice pilaf. We really enjoyed this dish! The steak was cooked perfectly tender and the seasoning was just right to where you can still really enjoy the flavor of the meat. The rice pilaf was super flavorful and addicting. Also the salad had a super light dressing that didn't overpower the flavor of the meal at all. Everything went together very well.   The greek fries were not my favorite. I'm sure it's because we ordered them to-go and by the time we got home they were soggy. But they were also lacking feta, parsley and seasoning.   Other than that, the super lemon chicken herb pita is a winner! I can't wait to try their other pitas."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food.  I preferred their rice to other places in town.  Nice and fluffy without being dry.  The lamb was also nice and moist and nicely seasoned and spiced.   The service was good but it's a walk up counter don't expect table side service.  I would definitely put this over the other places in town."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since before Yelp! was even around (no seriously.)  And I love it.  For years I've come here on a weekly or so basis and gotten my to-go order for lunch at work.  I get the Veggie Kabob (Vegetarian here) but back in the day before I was a Vegetarian, I had the Steak Kabob - SO.  GOOD.  Also the Greek Fries are like heaven in your mouth.  I could eat them all day (and I do, and that's why I also have a gym membership.)  I also tend to order extra salad or rice when I go, because it's so good.  They have plenty of ample seating and a nice background noise of music, as well as a TV usually on during the day.    The staff is also really friendly.  I love to just go in there and chat with them while I wait for my food - they're caring and this is a great example of a family owned business that we need more of in Vegas.  (I know I've said it already: but TRY THE GREEK FRIES!)"}
{"text":"Waiting for my food for an hour and its for pick up and I called 15 mins earlier then only to find out it was just sitting there the whole time. I understand its packed and busy but waiting for no reason is a waste of time, always try to pay attention. Other than that the food is incredibly delicious and yes I will go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered a chicken skewer plate and waited 30 minutes while who ordered after me received their food. I went up to the counter and told them that I hadn't received my food yet. Despite being given an order number, they couldn't remember what I ordered. I just asked for my money back.  Congratulations on your 1-star! Without a doubt the worst service I have ever received out here."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever! Seriously I can't stop eating here! We came here 3 times in one week. I have had the lemon chicken gyro and it's soooo soo good! Chicken is juicy and has the perfect amount of lemony taste.  This place gets really busy at lunch so leave enough time to get your food. Owner and staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place in town, we love their food and their service.  You alway feel welcome.  The food is amazing, great flavor and they always use fresh ingredients.  I highly recommend their Dolmades (Stuffed grape leaves), they are incredible."}
{"text":"Great food. Highly recommended, probably the best Greek food in Vegas.   Service VERY SLOW. Make sure to order in advance. Gyros meat is freshly roasted and shaved in the back; it doesn't get much more authentic than this.  Chicken Souvlaki was great; reflected all the classic flavors of Eastern Europe. Hummus was fresh, light, delightfully spiced, and tasty.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Satisfied desire for Greek but not the best.... I love Greek food and have had many places. The spanikopita was not balanced... Way more dough than spinach and cheese. The salad was also not proportioned and I don't remember Greek salad with well done croutons. The hummus was good but pitas were Not made there as seen in the bags sitting on the counter.  They also were disorganized for a busy time of day with people snapping rude comments running around. One girl was nice and tried to be helpful but the guy then overpowered and was short with her even right in front of us. Now I love spanikopita so I guess my search continues....."}
{"text":"I've lived across the street from this hidden treasure for almost a year! I'd seen it plenty of times, and although I'd never eaten Greek food, I wanted to give it a try. So finally, I decided to try it. Because it was new to me, I decided to keep it simple. I ordered the Spanakopita. Lord have mercy, it was a flavor overload that my taste buds had been dying for!!! Imagine, such a simple dish with amaze ball flavor!   Since then, my husband has become addicted to the \"big fats\"; and I've tried the dolmades, and pastitsio. He's also tried the lemon herb chicken pita. We both have yet to be disappointed. In all honesty, we eat here weekly. So much so that when I call in my pickup order, they know it's me...and they make sure I get my 'spana'. Keep up the good work guys! We love and appreciate everything about Yassou!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here EVERYDAY??   But I moved. Little far this is my favorite place there Greek food is AUTHENTIC   Always tastes fresh and very flavorful..... My favorite is the lemon herb chicken salad   U can see them making your good which is nice of you have some sort of trust issues....  This is defiantly a place I have never had anything bad To say about its amazing and I totally will keep Going and recommending"}
{"text":"We have been all over Las Vegas and no other Greek place compares. The food is superb and the price is amazing."}
{"text":"i think this is the best place to eat greek or meditaranian food in Las Vegas. This is also family owned business for longest time in Las Vegas west area. Owner is the chef means always good food. Its always fresh and clean. Love their own sause and Big fat gyro. Checken greek salad has unique taste and way different that othe greek joints. Hidden place but  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Efcharisto! It is impossible for me to truly express my gratitude to the son of the owner of Yassou, who, despite the long take out order line out the door, continually asked my mother and I if we were satisfied with our meal. Satisfied hardly does this excellent Greek Restaurant justice! The souvlaki combo was composed of moist, succulent chicken that just fell off the skewer and the beef passed the same test remarkably well. The owner's son, who waited on us, made certain that calamari was available and placed our order. 10 minutes later we had our food. Terrific portion sizes, delectable entrees and sides, and mixed greens on the side for those of us who want to up their game when it comes to nutrition. Best Greek food this side of town? Hands down the best! Thank you for being close by and I will definitely be back soon as well as often!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from our house! Lucky us! We eat here at least once a month. I've never had anything I didn't like. Usually get the gyro souvlaki and have plenty of leftovers. Love me some Yassou's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in as we were passing through the area - so glad  we did. Best Gyros ever! Meat was very tender and flavorful. Soup was fantastic. Baklava was wonderful - not overly sweet, savory and flavorful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"For Vegas there aren't many great Greek or middle eastern places. This place was awesome. I had the big fat gyro with fries and a drink as a take out order they didn't skimp on the meat and it was delicious. The pita was soft and flavorful. Fast friendly service. Will definitely return. Wish there was one in the north side."}
{"text":"I heard great things about place but but the one reason I'm giving this place two stars is because of bad management. The one time I went there to get their legendary lemon-herb chicken soup is when they were out. And, it was only 3pm. I was still recovering from a fever so my trip to tget food took way longer. I'll probably give this place another try sometime but until then this place has left a bad taste in my mouth--so to speak."}
{"text":"Recently, dined in and the food was fantastic .. Best Greek food in town. Their rice is always perfection."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere authentic feel and food we really enjoy coming here . The souvlaki is amazing and the have the best tzatziki sauce love it . Try the Greek fries !"}
{"text":"Pro tip: The Gyros are full of good stuff so for an extra dollar you can get some extra pita bread (definitely tell them you don't want it cut up though because they did when I ordered it and it completely defeated the purpose of me trying to make an extra gyro. For that they lost a star.)   My bf and I came in here and ordered the big fat gyro and the super lemon steak pita. The onions are really sharp and give you that extra crunch to your pita. Pair that with the Greek fries and you're set for an extra delicious lunch. The fries are exactly what you want. Crispy and lightly dusted with fresh parley and feta cheese. Some places can over do it. My dish was great but it was falling apart (which is why I needed the extra pita). It fell on my dish and suddenly I was full. My bf really enjoyed his meal. He typically orders his gyro without any lettuce. I keep all the good stuff in. It's a perfect hearty rainbow meal. And if you're like me you can save some for a snack later."}
{"text":"Omg, if you want a fabulous fresh meal, this is the place to go.  Their salmon is out of this world, the best in town. The lemon sauce is wonderful and the fish is fresh and moist.   We have been coming here for many years and have never been disappointed.   The staff is friendly and the owner takes pride in his restaurant.    You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and asked a coworker were I could find a Greek restaurant. This place did not disappoint! I was skeptical about the wait time because I decided to go inside to place an order for take out. The wait time was short and the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"U cant go wrong with this place i love everything .....the chicken the steak salad smoothie bannas .yum yum yum"}
{"text":"I typically order for pick up. The service is fine. No complaints there but it doesn't rank highly among some of the other Mediterranean places I like in Vegas i.e. Shish Kabob House  and Market Street Grille. The meats and veggies and rice all seem to be better quality at these other places. They do give pretty good quantity for the price but it's not a place I'd recommend if you have other options nearby."}
{"text":"My go to place for Greek food! It's so so so so good! I always order their mini souvlaki plate. Everything is always made fresh to order and is very well seasoned. Their Greek fries are also really good too. Basically anything you order will be delicious haha. Trust me!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is a neighborhood restaurant that stays consistent.  The food is excellent, you cant beat the price for the well portioned meals, and the service is fast and friendly.    I've moved out of the neighborhood but I can say I'll go out of my way to come here for a great meal."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend and saw this Greek place and WOW what a great find in LV! had the skewers, the hummus, the pilaf, the salad. SO GOOD! The staff was friendly and came over to deliver our meal. Great food. Other Greek people were eating there so it must be good! GO THERE! so yummy and the staff is engaging!  I can't say much else but I wish they were here!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Greek restaurants and this is on the top of my list! This time, I ordered the salmon plate and it was divine!! Salmon wasn't dry or over cooked. It's actually the best salmon I've had from a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant! My 10 month old son enjoyed their avgolemoni. Definitely will be coming back here with my family again. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time.. My order was completely screwed up and didn't even get a receipt. I even ordered cucumbers with my hummus and the guy at the counter said sure no problem but I never heard him mention it to the chef.. It appears I got the totally wrong order even though I stood there with a number which he called out!! I would never go back to this place.. Paymons and even the Mad Greek blow this place out of the water for both flavor and service. The fries which weren't even what I ordered Tasted horrible too !!!"}
{"text":"I am a Food Network restaurant chaser.  Mainly Diner, Drive ins and Dives.  Not sure why this restaurant hasn't been profiled yet.  Great food, great prices.  Wonderful family owned business that takes pride in food quality and presentation.   I wish all restaurants had the same standard.  Worth the drive if you are from out of town and coming from the strip."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of Greek food. This place is pretty fantastic. I got the lemon herb steak salad and for something so simple, it sure was mighty tasty! The chef is friendly and will make suggestions for you as well."}
{"text":"Mostly Greek men working the grill and counter. Quality food, attentive staff, lively atmosphere. Had the Gyros sandwich several times and finally tried a combo dish and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"After trying a drive-thru greek stop and a couple others on Sahara, we decided to hop on to Charleston and give this place a try.  It looks so fresh and inviting in the building it's in, and because it's one of those places that you would normally drive by on a regular day, I wanted to see if it was any good.  My husband is the Greek food lover, while I am just so-so on it.  We ordered a lot--the stuffed grape leaves, two big gyros, some dessert, seasoned fries, pita bread and hummus.  Everything tasted great--the gyro was in this soft, yummy pita with some feta cheese and veggies.  The meat was really good, too.  Nicely seasoned.  The hummus was my favorite, and I had to order extra bread to finish it off.  I didn't eat the grape leaves but my husband said it was really good and had a strong herbal flavor to them.  They made this honey pastry cake and it was mildly sweet and sticky.    Overall, the food was great for a Greek stop and we frequent that place when we are in the mood for that kind of food.  The owner is there working once in awhile, and his son is there all the time.  Having a family work the business is a great sight to see, and ensures for me that they care about their food and therefore the quality there will always be good.  If you like Greek, you should give this place a shot and see if you become addicted to it or not.  Lots of yelpers are fans, and although the good was great, I'm not a total fan.  For me to give four stars it has to haunt me in my dreams.  Still, great food."}
{"text":"It's great here. Friendly staff, delicious food.   The souvlaki combo is my favorite. They also have a mini souvlaki combo, not on the regular menu, but posted by the register. It's still huge."}
{"text":"I love me some Greek. I had just moved to Vegas and was looking for a good Greek place. I think I have tried them all. Only Yassou's was worth my time to sit down and write a review. I haven't had anything there that wasn't amazing. I go at least once a week and every new person I bring there loves it. So glad I found this place. Try it. You won't be disappointed.   FYI the Super Lemon Herb Chicken Pita is nothing short of magic."}
{"text":"No other Greek restaurant compares to this place. While it can be a bit pricy, it has never let me down."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Greek Food but this place was AMAZING. The food is fresh and so good. If you are looking for a great \"Greek\" place with food that melts in your mouth, this is the place..."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Delicious, great service, great food. The chicken salad was so good and tasty and the chicken was juicy and lemony. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't go there Sundays I got so sick I was in the bathroom for 3 hours I got a sandwich and it hardly had any meat inside it was full of sauce"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! The restaurant itself is a bit small and tucked away, but none the less the food is  good. The portions are pretty generous and the prices are not bad."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Greek food. They have an amazing selection of food and drinks. They get extremely crowded during lunch time, so be prepared for that. Otherwise, I'll be coming back here anytime I have cravings for Greek food!"}
{"text":"Best lemon chicken salad! The staff is always so welcoming and friendly and the food is delicious. You can't go wrong with yassou"}
{"text":"Authentic! Amazing! Flavorful! Price is on point! Never a disappointing meal. Recommend this place to families too!"}
{"text":"I genuinely love the food here. The chicken and pita bread is so darn delicious. The staff is always so friendly. My food is always fresh. The greek salad dressing is delicious so get extra. They have great lunch specials too. I also get the baklava. I have had the beef plate which was good, but I think the chicken is better. The greek fries are yummy  I love the fact that you can see the kitchen, you can see the cooks prepare your food. Cleanliness is a must. They also have a very nice patio for dining."}
{"text":"Overall good food and would return for another meal... Our experience began oddly... As we were ordering, we were told there was no mango for smoothie... Jokingly, I told  the guy he was fired-- and he was ready to walk-- bad day apparently. After settling our order we sat and were served someone else's order... Which ended up a treat for all of us involved in the snafu (hope the kid who made the mistake isn't punished too harshly-- we left happy) we received the wraps given us in error, plus a complimentary potato caviar dip which I would never have ordered before this but now we will!! We enjoyed our dinner and have lunch for next day too!! And we'll be happy to eat it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy! Best Greek food in town. They never get an order wrong and always took to perfection. I love how the owner is always there and in the back cooking as well. Real friendly and always fresh! Even open on Sundays  my favorite are \"my big fat gyro\" and \"Lemon herb chicken salad\" and don't forget the baklava for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town. Spankopita & greek fries are awesome. Perfect for lunch don't forget they close fairly early no late dinners here."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and the food was great. The dining room could definitely use some love. It's a little cramped and getting to the outside tables is slightly confusing. The service was very friendly and I'm thinking this may be our go-to Greek place   If you're on the fence I say its worth a shot. Stop in and see what you think.   So far I haven't strayed far from the gyros but I plan on further exploring the menu (hopefully not at the detriment to my waist size ;) )"}
{"text":"Went in for Some Greek food today I walked into the Greek Grill, the girl at front her nose was red as if she had a bad cold it was running and she was wiping her nose with her hand. I decided right then and there I am not eating here cause I don't want her handling my food and going food without gloves  Gross , walked out   Too bad , the menu look great ... But the lack of sanitary practices made our appetites go away"}
{"text":"What's not to love about homemade Greek food served with a smile in heaping portions at reasonable prices? Family owned and it shows in the consistently good service and quality. I'm a big fan of the Spanakopita (flaky pastry stuffed with spinach and feta cheese), the gyro meat and the lemon garlic chicken skewers. You can double up on salad to keep it healthy or comply with all the low carb diet needs. There is a cute outdoor patio and plenty of indoor seating. Limited parking is the only downside to this delicious lunch spot."}
{"text":"TOP GREEK CAFE SO FAR!   **2016 YELP 100 LV CHALLENGE #1**   SO I thought I had tasted the best Greek cafe mom & pop shop, but w/ the new year I have found another GEM in Las Vegas!! Although it is a bit far I am willing to drive the distance! We even saw the owner working his but off in the kitchen which you know that the food is being prepared at it's best!!   The staff are SUPER HAPPY all the time it seems & enjoy what they do. You can definitely see it in the food. You order your food at the redigister & pay then they bring out the food to your table.  The restaraunt is nice & big w/ outdoor seating as well. One thing that I LOVED was that it was SPACIOUS & clean cut... not too much decoration clutter everywhere. The high ceilings also a plus. The kitchen is an OPEN kitchen so you can see all of your food being cooked & you get all of the yummy smell of the food being prepared as well. One more thing was how CLEAN the freaken bathrooms were.   BIG FAT SPECIAL W/ FRIES & SODA $10.59 - the flame broiled beef & lamb is something I don't usually get but that's an automatic meat that comes w/ the big fat special.... I be so SURPRISED at how DERICIOUS the darn meat was & how much meat came in the gryo! You can make another gyro out of it.  SMALL GREEK SALAD $3.99 - I will have to say this was the least of my favorite.... I like my dressing a little more salty & acidic but this one was more olive oil than I would want. Still protiom wise it was pretty big for a small salad.  HUMMUS $4.99 - absolutely PERFECT flavor!!!! Just the right amount of garlic & oil w/ citrus... the pita bread was warm & fluffy  MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA W/CKN $8.99 - they use a 9\" flat bread & make a pizza out of it! The ratios were all EVEN! Chicken pieces in every bite... an OCD person's dream pizza ahhahaha"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant all the time because the food is good and the staff is amazing. Paula, the Manager and the rest of the staff always greets everyone, and the food is the best in town. The food of course and friendliness of the staff is why i continue to eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is my fave Greek restaurant. Now granted I keep ordering the same damn thing, but baby its done to perfection. Its ran by a real Greek family, and they are super nice. They seem to know all of their regulars. So go there you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place feels so authentic. The service was great and the food was plenty. One meal was enough for my husband and I didn't realize how close it was to our house. We ordered the slouvaki combo and the meat was so tender and juicy. The salad was awesome and the bread was fresh. We got a side order of Parmesan covered fries and it was to die for. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Always fresh, tender, tasty... spanikopita was dry but the food's usually very consistent.  Good food, value...2 can eat for under $20"}
{"text":"The big fat gyro is so yummy!  One of the best gyros I've had for sure.  The pita bread is delicious and moist as well.  We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This time we were able to dine in.  Therefore I was able to witness, and be able to provide a nicer review.  I'll say it's better to dine in for the sake of no confusion as to whether they are speaking to you; versus ordering by phone.  Much more charming to have your meal indoors.  Cultural music is played, sorta gives the feel.  Their walls are white and blue as you would find iconic in Greece.  Although it was extremely warm walking in, they turned on the a.c. and it cooled up pretty quickly.  Yassou is busy during lunch hour, and they do work fast.  I saw them brooming up under tables inside and outside, cleaning off tables as guests were through.  Not so spic and span, but average dining areas.  It's great that they have outdoor seating especially right now in November afternoons, Vegas still has pleasantly warm weather, sunny and blue skies.  I'll give yay points for their food being tasty.  We ordered Greek pasta with gyro (spaghetti with brown butter imported mizithra cheese) and a Gyro plate.  They're winners; again a lot of food on one plate and average prices.  Cannot get over their yellow rice - so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"On their menu it says \"Greek food never tasted so Greek.\"  And I agree!  We found this gem because it is located next to Hottie Hair Salon.  We came during lunch last week and the place was BOOMING!  We had to pile into a line that was poking out the door.  Every table was taken (except for outside) and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to find a table big enough to accommodate our party of five.  Luckily, we came a bit later than noon.  By the time it was our turn to order, the tables had cleared out some and we were able to grab a seat.  I was torn on what to get, but I was kind of hungry so instead of opting for the \"My Big Fat Gyro\" which comes with fries and a drink, I ordered the \"Gryo Plate.\"  The plate came with beef and lamb, greek salad, rice, pita bread and tzatziki sauce.  It took about 10 minutes for our food to come, but the sign at the counter says to please allow 15 minutes.   At this time I was so hungry that I grabbed a piece of pita, put some meat in it and tzatziki sauce.  I took a bite and I couldn't help but be startled by what I did next.  I uncontrollably said \"WOW!\"  I had surprised myself when I did that, but it really was that good.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The plate offers very large portions.  I felt like I got a bargain for the price that I paid.  The employees were efficient and friendly.  The place was really busy and I could TASTE why.  Next time I come I am getting the \"My Big Fat Gryo\" special with american fries and a drink.   I am hoping to eat there again soon for lunch.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Always a perfect five star eating experience in this place. I'm in the restaurant business and I can appreciate when a place goes the extra mile to make it fresh with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The Big Fat Gyro is the best I've had in Las Vegas, though I'll try to convince myself to order something different the next time I come here. Why? Because that damn gyro is as big as my head! I couldn't even finish it all. Garlic fries were good as well. This is an order at the counter and take a number back to your table kind of place. They'll bring it to you, don't worry. The place has a casual diner style ambience with a nice patio and super friendly service. The pricing is perfect as well. For two people, we only spent $20 on two big fat gyro combos with greek fries (blue cheese and garlic). The restaurant and parking lot were absolutely packed when we came, and I can definitely see why. This is clearly a local gem."}
{"text":"I read someone else's review who had ordered the same thing as I did, and we share the same sentiments. The chicken pita & Greek fries were not good. The pita was dry like it was three days old, and the sandwich itself had no flavor. Then oddly enough, on the last bite I hit a mouthful of pure salt. I had to drench it in tzatiki to make it somewhat enjoyable. The fries were hard--not crispy but hard and there was zero flavor as well which is hard to imagine. Hardly any feta, and I threw them away after eating a few. I never add salt to anything but everything needed some sort of seasoning.   The people at the counter were nice, but I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek place, hands down! The quality is amazing!  I've tried practically everything on the menu...all are good.  Don't look any further,  just come here. Spanokopita..a must get. Salads are always fresh, and compliment any of the entrees. Can you say gyros!? Get one..you won't regret it. They've been in business for a while,  and you can see why. Staff is friendly and they really know the menu.  They explain everything, and make recommendations. Love it! So happy we live close by,  and can come whenever."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots for Greek food! Everything here is good! I usually order either the Yassou pita, the spanokopita, chicken/steak souvlaki or any of the plates! I'm happy each time. The yogurt tzatziki sauce is delish! The hummus is great as well. Never disappointed !"}
{"text":"Co-workers rave about this place so I decided to take a detour on my way home and stop by for lunch.   All I can say is:Yum! this is one of the better Greek restaurants I have eaten at. I ordered the gyro plate. It comes with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, beef and lamb, and pita. I took a seat and minutes later they brought out my plate. The meat is so tender, the pita was nice and warm and the salad was fresh. My only complaint was that although the rice pilaf was soft and fluffy it was a bit too salty for me. But I still ate it and before I knew it my plate was empty and I was stuffed.   As I went to the coke machine for a refill one of the cooks came out for the kitchen and asked how was everything. I still had a mouth full of food so I gave him a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Don't get to come as often as I would like as I live so far away. Thank goodness I was in the area for a meeting.   Awesome food and 5 star service!"}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best Greek food I have ever tasted.  I ordered the Moussaka Plate and it was amazing. The dish itself was warm and flavorful (not to mention filling!). The pita was freshly made and was the perfect side for my meal.  The owner was working his tail off to make sure everyone was happy and the staff was very kind. My wife enjoyed her meal as well (I forget what it was).  I will definitely be going back here. The tea was tasty and hot (boom!)."}
{"text":"I Always get the gyro plate. It's so delicious and they give generous portions of meat. The cucumber sauce is so good although extra sauce is $0.25 per new container.   Also tried the steak and chicken kabobs and they were amazing.. Juicy and moist...  The pastitio is good too..."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Greek food, my faves are the deluxe Greek salad, the big fat gyro and you have to try the Greek fries delish! Friendly service and super good food."}
{"text":"the taste was really healthy, you know you are eating at a local restaurant that keeps to their name and tradition. my wife and i came here for lunch coz apparently her and her coworkers eat here for lunch. she knows to order in prior to her break to avoid the wait since we only have 30mins to eat. The food was amazing in portion and taste and presentation. The customer service of everyone felt like what a business should be like, family-owned through and through. It's a clean place, also good location and this place was always busy. Parking could be a challenge but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Even though I have never traveled to Greece, I feel that every opportunity I have to indulge in Yassou I get a little taste.  First and foremost the staff and atmosphere is great.  The cashier who is there almost everyday and is most likely a member of the family, is fluent in Greek.  One of my friends is studying the language and soon found himself being schooled by the cashier.  The food is quite good and I have had many items on the menu.  I still prefer Market Grills Gyros because you have the option of hummus over the normal spread.  It is also slightly more expensive then market grill so be prepared for that.  But I think the experience here is more authentic."}
{"text":"Great food, packed place. Playing Greek music in the background. Glad I found this place, I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Las Vegas, made to order.  Fresh, hot, and filling.  Serving portions are wonderful.  The service is top notch.  Christian and his father work to make sure our experiences are great every time!  We will be back again very soon.  Thanks so much Christian!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is wonderful. Everyone is friendly and helpful.   The seating inside is limited but theres another area where people can sit too, its an inside patio.  The food is well super delicious. I love the grape leaves with meat inside my favorite. I have had the gyro and its so tasty. The meat is just right full of flavor exploding in your mouth. The Greek fries are my favorite fries anywhere. My go to is the lamb and chicken plate. Both meats are flavorful and good portions. Rice is made to perfection and the salad too. I haven't had the desserts but im sure they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ordered spanikopita plate which includes greek salad, rice, tatziki, hummus, pita bread, dolmades, and 4 triangles of spanikopita. Ordered some baklava too. Food was good, good portion size, and I will be back to try their pizza since they ran out of pizza dough."}
{"text":"The food is always seasoned just right. They never just overload on spices and hope for the best. I have ordered the chicken souvlaki here several times and it always tastes the same...always delicious.   I visit duting random times so I don't really know when they're rush is like but there are always people going in and out of the place. The service is always friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places -- super love their Steak Souvlaki plate! The steak is always tender, delicious and bursting with flavor! Once a week, we do a special lunch/cheat day at work and 90% of the time, this is where we want to eat :) The staff is also super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This is always my go to for fresh, healthy, delicious fast food! Call ahead and pick up or order in. Their kabobs are so perfectly grilled. The salad dressing is on point, and I have tried SO HARD to recreate it at home- but no. Ive been eating here for YEARS and love this place!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We've been here a couple of times and we just can't get enough of the Greek Fries!!! It might just be the best fries in town :) The lemon herb steak pita was soooo good! I'm craving for it right now as I think about it! Hummus is yummy! And of course, the Greek Salad is something we'll be coming back for! What a great place! It is family run and you can tell that they take pride in preparing the freshest and best dish for you!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love the pork skewers and salad! Lots of good stuff here. So far all I've tried here has been thumbs up! This place has a great vibe and location."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming and thought the food was going to be a lot better due to their amount of great reviews. The food was just alright."}
{"text":"This is my go to Greek spot in town. Food is always delicious. Great portions and an affordable price.   The Chicken and Steak Souvlaki Combo is the business."}
{"text":"Once you walk in, someone greets you. It seems like a family run business. The father I think does the cooking. I ordered the gyro combo and my bf ordered the steak souvlaki plate. The gyro was delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful. The steak souvlaki was so juicy, flavorful and tender. It almost melts in your mouth. The pilaf rice was delicious. I live how I can taste the spices in everything. I will definitely come back to try the infamous Greek fries. The added plus is that everyone is incredibly nice and service is on point."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I come here! The food is amazing! I feel like it's really made with love! Sometimes the line is out the door. That's how you know its delicious! The only thing I would like to see is a different set up maybe move the soda machine down so that the line is not interrupting guest that need a refill. Other than that I love this place and I will continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Love this place come here ALL the time but today sucked.  I had to come back for taziki and then there were no tomatoes on my gyro.. really frustrating  Super bummed I'm sick and all I wanted was a nice easy pick up meal.. having t come back really sucked.  Not sure why there weren't tomatoes on my gyro when they are included in them all the time... prly won't be back for a while as this happens twice in a row. Please pay attention to what guests order... they even read it back to me and still didn't get it right. I'm not one to review on yelp but this really pissed me off"}
{"text":"I am a Greek/Mediterranean food fanatic.  After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give Yassou a try. I was pleasantly greeted by the man running the register. He seemed friendly on a personal basis with several of the customers there which is a good sign (repeat customers).  I decided to get Yassou gyro combo with Greek fries. I was very impressed with the gyro. It was delicious.  The greek fries were good, but not impressive.  The spices advertised must have left out.  I got regular fries with feta cheese and a little greenery on top, but they are only fries. I'll take a good gyro over fries any day. I look forward to trying out more of their menu."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I tried the saganaki, spanakopita, and the big fat gyro. Everything was delicious. The service was outstanding as well. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place gets great reviews but I thought it was just alright. Maybe I'm missing something... The steak kabob was decent, but the chicken kabob was better. The portion size of the combo platter was pretty big -- large enough to get two meals out of it.  The super lemon chicken pita was good. Full of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and other tasty stuff. It's also messy. Grab several napkins especially if you plan to eat on the go."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food in Las Vegas it is far away from the strip but the drive is totally worth it"}
{"text":"LOVE and obsess about this place! Completely on the other side of town for me but one of the best Greek spots in town, fore sure.  The Big Fat Gyro, any meat, I tried the chicken and it was super flavorful and juicy. The Souvlaki Como, also an amazing pick, however, after a couple visits, I have decided the Gyro is my fave! Don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu, especially if you're a fan of Greek food."}
{"text":"the restaurant is located at Charleston and Buffalo. Their menu has all the standard Greek favorites such as Gyros, Spanakopita, and Dolmades. They also have Greek Fries which is served crispy and piping hot and drenched in garlic, spices and feta cheese.   I love their Greek fries and Big fat Gyro and it was enough for two people. The price is decent and the service is good. You order at their counter and they deliver their food to your table.  The atmosphere is casual, clean and have outside seating. It is good place for me to bring a  small get together party."}
{"text":"Can't believe the negative reviews that I read.........huh???  We must not have eaten at the same place?!?!?!? I consider this place to be far superior to Paymon's and all the other Americanized versions of Greek food that you can find here in town.  As for Lapriel H., that yelped about the man behind the counter was a Will Farrell look-a-like, etc. etc....................if you had read the literature on the wall, you'd have noticed that the man you're referring to is the owner, originally from Cyprus,  and  he spends 14 hours a day there both cooking and interacting with the patrons.  ~I recommend the Big Fat Gyro.......oh my, it's AMAZING!  It's a mixture of lamb and  beef and the meat is sooooooo tender!  The veggies are fresh and crisp and the feta is of a good quality!  The size of this thing resembles its name.......BIG & FAT! ~The Greek fries are fantastic..........a taste of lemon, parsley, salt and feta! ~And lastly, the Baklava.........what!!!!!!  I compare every single piece of Baklava that I eat to my mother's, who in my opinion, still makes the very best, but this was fantastic in so many different ways!  For those people who like Baklava for its traditional flakiness........this will satisfy your taste buds but with quite a twist.  It's covered with a honey sauce that makes it mushy to just the right degree......almost a cake like texture.  I can't describe it, can't put it into words..... ~It's a casual, near fast food type place with a very homey atmosphere!   A+"}
{"text":"Yassou Greek Grill Cafe is some of the best Greek food I've ever had. The restaurant is very casual, and is a great place to have lunch. Portions are very large though. The staff is very friendly and kind, and food was out in a reasonable amount of time (10-15 minutes) and was so flavorful and tasty. The location was also fairly easy to find. My favorite dish is the gyro and chicken skewer. Great place for lunch and also for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Fantastic Greek Food!! We tried chicken souvlaki,  gyro and souvlaki plate, hummus plate,  spanakopita and the rice pudding.  Flavors were fantastic, portions ample, and the value was great! Would eat here again and recommend to all my friends.  They don't have falafel, that's really the only downside,  also a slight wait,  but well worth it!"}
{"text":"As the Greek Festival approaches and we see those placard reminders just about everywhere, I feel it's time I review the Yassou Greek Grill Café.   After the disaster that is the Mad Greek, I was afraid I would be inclined to allow my distaste to taint my review of Yassou, so I made sure to try it a couple of times.  Don't ask me to remember the names of my orders, other than there's always a gyro and usually some dolmades. What I do remember is that they always put my Tzatziki sauce at the side. Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, just not always slathered on like they do at some places.  The gyro was really good, with the perfect combination of ingredients so you could enjoy each bite, with sauce or without.  The dolmades are always wonderful - just knowing they're hand made is a huge plus n my book.  I am so looking forward to the festival next month, I hope the food there is as good as Yassou does it, or better even."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some Mediterranean Cuisine, it reminds me of my time spent back east hanging out with my Greek, Persian, Spanish, and Turkish friends and first being exposed to new ingredients and tasty cuisines for the first time. It also reminded me of my time spent at the Wine Spectator Restaurant at The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone where the menu items we made covered flavors from the Mediterranean Regions, from Paella, Moussaka, Dolmades, Kofta, and Skordalia, to Avgolemono, Lavash, Taramosalatta, Spanokopita, and Baklava we did a little of everything. Also taking Cooking courses with Mediterranean food authority and chef Joyce Goldstein was a great bonus.  Wifey's not as big as a fan as I am, so I kinda had to sorta beg and plead and twist her arm to check out Yassou Greek Grill Cafe since we were close by...(It worked!) Yassou was a good find! Perusing the menu, I see Taramosalatta, a dip made from cured fish roe, potatoes, lemon juice and olive oil. I love that stuff and I order it as a starter.\"Whoa!?!?!? you even pronounced it correctly!?!?! Great choice!\" The guy behind the register says with a surprised look...(Refer to above paragraph)  We also shared a Lemon Herb Chicken Pita and a Souvlaki Combo. The Taramosalatta arrives and we dig in. Yassou's version was okay, but I'm used to a stronger taste of the cured roe, and I didn't really taste the potato in there, more like overkill on the olive oil. Every bite of the pita was delicious as was the combo, but the beef skewer was a tad on the dry side. Overall, a solid meal, and I still have to try out a few other spots that were highly yelped (Paymon's, Zaytoon, Parsley, Great Greek, etc.) ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Greek food! The plates are so good, rice and gyro, steak plates, pita, you name it--Just get it to go, because the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired.  It's more cafeteria style than restaurant.  But the food is very good.  The steak in the steak salad is juicy and flavorful, and just the right amount.  The salad greens are fresh and perked up with herbs and a rich salad dressing.  The gyro sandwich is very generously stuffed with lamb and pork.  The french fries are meh.  The Greek fries are not quite right, either.  But get the hummus and pita instead, which is much better than the grocery store variety (if you've been getting by on that kind.)  The baklava is quite nice, rich, and not too sweet, but really sticky--in a nice way.  Try the sparking Greek water.  Call ahead and order for pick up.  It is much better than waiting, if you're going to take out (the best way to do here).  They can get backed up, and depending on who is up front, it can be a bit slow.  But believe it or not, it can even be romantic here, in the evening."}
{"text":"The Gyro's here are just ok,  Meat is not very spicy, too much lettuce in the Gyro.  The lemon Chicken soup is not good.  It tasted like campbell's with lemon juice added.  Very disappointing.  Dear Yelpers,  I need help! Please let me know where the best Greek Restaurant is in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had Greek food before this place and this place made me LOVE Greek food. Their gyros and beyond delicious, packed with meat and flavor. Let's not mention the Greek fries, my mouth is watering from just thinking about it and the lemon juice and feta cheese. The entire meal will fill you up for the day so the price is good for a meal this size. This place started my love for Greek food and I'm so glad I lost my Greek food virginity here. It's casual, the staff is very nice, and most importantly, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best little bit of money you will spend. Food is made to order and always tastes super fresh. I love the plate with chicken skewers, rice pilaf and salad, a perfect $10 meal. Check them out."}
{"text":"Took my food to go: big fat gyro, Greek fries and extra tzatziki sauce. Love this place for both the quality, quantity and price."}
{"text":"Greek food is one of my favorites and I googled this spot and wow the service was amazing! He was so kind and answered my questions about the menu! He even brought my food to my table where I was sitting! I will definitely come back thank you!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate The new music is hideous old world music. Can't stand to eat in anymore.  Please get rid of it.  Been going every week for years"}
{"text":"Great experience here! It was my boyfriend and I's first time trying Greek food and wow, pretty amazing stuff they have going on here. The minute you enter you suddenly feel like you're not in Vegas. The people working, the people around eating in the restaurant makes you feel like you're in Greece, very authentic. Their hummus was addicting, glad we had more than enough to take home. Their mizithra pasta was, amazing! And the boyfriend enjoyed his Greek plate mini filled with pork, chicken and lamb. We had an amazing experience here, would love to go again."}
{"text":"So So - Greek food... I have had better in smaller joint across town... not bad if you are on their side of town - light fare... Was looking for the Wow factor - did not find it... nothing wrong with the food - just average...  your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"Yassou!! This is a one of a kind family run restaurant with excellent food and friendly owners. If you want a recommendation the Big Fat Gyro with Greek Fries special is excellent. All of the food is great and they expanded their dining area to accommodate the constant overflow of diners that they had."}
{"text":"One of the best places that I've been for Greek food in all of Vegas! The food is PHENOMENAL I've tried multiple things at Yassous but my favorite is The Pork Souvlaki! All the food is great though. Service is top notch also, most times ownership is at the restaurant and they are so humble and kind. My most recent visit there was a new employee I believe his name was Demario and he just made the whole experience joyful!  Good job guys! And Vegas go check out Yassous!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food and service is superb. I would not hesitate ot return to Yassou and to bring my friends. If you like Greek and Mediterranean food you will love Yassou."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good. But make sure to check your order before leaving. I've been here more than a few times for take out and everytime my order is wrong. Just disappointing."}
{"text":"The Yassou Greek Grill Cafe was one of life's little happy surprises.  Although I've lived in the area for over thirty years and they have been open for seven, this was the first time I walked in the door (due to the yelp reviews I read on my phone). The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars, was that it looked like my home office at tax time (a bit unorganized and cluttered) with half of the chairs upside down on the tables in the middle of the afternoon.  The service was friendly, and was told that they get very busy at lunch time.  The food was superb.  It was the best Greek food I've tasted since I left Chicago thirty years ago.  The dolmodes (thank goodness not vegan) had it's ground lamb and rice spiced to perfection, and was treated to love in its lemon sauce.  The spanikopita was probably the best I have ever tasted, with its filo dough layered and flaky, and very pleasantly spiced.    If I was blindfolded and served this food on a porcelain plate with silverware, I would have paid 50% more for the meal and would have thought the food was a bargain.  I can't wait to go back and try the pastitsio and moussaka."}
{"text":"Love this place! We come here often and the food is consistently delicious. Always fresh and just made.  Best Greek food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Okay seriously I freaking love this place. Everything here is delicious the owner is always here working with his son. It's just amazing food with great service!!"}
{"text":"Again...fresh, tasty food.  Don't forget a piece of that scrumptious baklava!!  Best value in town when it comes to Greek."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but foods are good, people are friendly, about 20 tables here. I especially like their calamari, rice, and Greek salad. About half an hour drive from The Strip, but it's worth the travel!"}
{"text":"THE BEST GREEK FOOD IN VEGAS hands down!!!!!! Family owned and operated they always care about quality of their food.  My husband and I have been coming to this place for years and never ever had bad meal or bad service! Unfortunately we moved to a different part of town and cannot come too often, but we definitely make sure we visit them few times a year.  I can never get enough of their rice! Chicken souvlaki and Greek salad are my favorites. As well as their \"Greek lasagna\" - pasticio.  My husband loves their gyros.  We bring our family here every time they visit out of town. Everyone we brought to Yassou, loved it and wanted more :) Amazing food!!! Nightly recommend!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER DISAPPOINTS! There has never been an item we've ordered here that we didn't like. Their gyro meat is amazing! The service is great! Their tzaziki sauce is the best. Something about their coke is great too! It's always crisp and just the right amount of fizziness!   We love this place!"}
{"text":"Gyros Heaven for sure. We go at least once a week. Food is off the charts and sometimes the parking is bad like the white Range Rover that took up two parking spaces today at 330PM, but hey, their kids were with them so I did not shame them at the table.  Food? The best. Period."}
{"text":"I gave this place totally a five star rating because it is well deserved. Everyone is super friendly and the food is outstanding, very authentic to the Greek cuisine. Even has a nice little outdoor patio that you can dine."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the combo plates with a chicken skewer and a beef skewer. It seemed like they were filling a catering order, so we had to wait a little while. But, the food was worth the wait. I liked how the plate had both rice and flatbread so we could try both. The meat also had good flavor and was juicy.  The man with the Bob Ross hair (the owner?) also came by, gave us a wink, and handed us a free order if feta fries :) They were so good.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be going back here."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is a local gem! The food is very fresh and usually cooked to perfection. The chicken is moist and tender, salad tasty and fresh and the pitas are excellent. I did try a piece of Baklava once and it was heaven on earth. This place is even worth a drive out if you're not in proximity. It is located near Summerlin around Buffalo and Charleston. Go see what all the hype is about at this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place in town we are NEVER disappointed!! You have to try it. Say hi to Christian and Pete"}
{"text":"I haven't had much Greek cuisine in the past. Usually my experience has been not good with gyro's but this place is the real deal. It's a great place run by a real Greek. You must visit this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a trip to the Social Security Office. What a gem of a restaurant. Very clean. Everyone was so friendly. We had the Big Fat Gyro. The menu is so delicious I wanted all of it. I guess that means we'll be back until we have tried everything and we'll have it with the rice pilaf. I highly recommend this place.  I have had some great Greek food in Greek Town in Chicago and this place is as good. It's a must try."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. I just had the gyro, but there was just the right amount of everything. Definitely a new regular eat out restaurant."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant. The most wonderful service and excellent food. We left feeling full and really valued as a customer. Can not recommend enough!!! Just fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were told about Yassou by a friend of hers, and they were right on the money. There is something about walking into this place and you know that it is going to have amazing food. It's set up like a mom and pop deli/restaurant outside the city limit establishment. No fancy entrance but not run down. Lot's of Greek flavor inside.  We ordered the gyro's (of course) and Greek fries. Simply amazing. The food took about 7 minutes or so to arrive at the table. Good size portions, I got the Big Fat Gyro, and I'm just happy to have finished it! The staff there is great! Very friendly and helpful. They could tell we were new there and were quick to point out some of the more popular items on the menu. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"DE-LICIOUS! My dad and I come here every time I am in town! Get the Gyro and Souvlaki plate! So good!  You can really tell when people care- and that's what you'll find here. I love Yassou!"}
{"text":"Chicken lunch special is always perfect- hummus with Pita bread is never a disappointment. Love love love this place. Always clean and the staff there is super friendly. If you must go between 11:45-12:30 consider take out. It so busy because it's so amazing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. The owner is engaging and genuinely cares about the food which is refreshing in Vegas. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food ever!  Our office placed a to-go order for 8 people.  The order was correct and the food was delicious!!  I really appreciate the vegetarian options.  The meatless dolmades are delicious but I really love the spanakopita.  I come here about one a month and have for many years now.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My large Greek salad, with lemon chicken, was missing the dressing when I got home and had a hair in it!!! $13 for that!!!"}
{"text":"I've only tried probably about 5 different Greek food places but this has hands down been my #1 FAVORITE! Greek food has never really been my go-to meal but ever since I've tried this place I literally CRAVE it.  My boss introduced me to this place for lunch one day and when I tried I just couldn't get enough. She always orders me the Chicken skewer plate which comes with 2 skewers, rice, Greek salad, pita bread, and hummus. There's not one thing I don't like from that meal-- first off, the chicken is so juicy and flavorful, the rice pairs so well with the chicken, Greek salad is my favorite, and you can never go wrong with pita and hummus. Not only is the food delicious but they aren't greedy with their portions either-- it's a lot of food on that plate and I always end my meal with a happy tummy. I want to try more things on the menu but that chicken skewer plate is sooo good I feel like I just can't steer away from it.  I will for sure be back and I have already been telling most of my friends about this place. I literally had to get this again the next day after trying it for my first time so that my boyfriend try it too."}
{"text":"I really like this place-I even consider it better than Paymon's or any of the Greek places I've been to in Las Vegas thus far.  The prices are very fair for what you get, and because it is \"fast-casual\", you don't really need to tip-a dollar or two is sufficient (IMO).  Food is fresh and very good.  It's a smaller place and not fancy, but it is VERY clean and is quite attractive.  The only negative is that they close rather early for my tastes (around 8 PM), and I really like to eat around 9 on weekends.  It's definitely worth a try-it's sort of \"out of the way\" in a retail/office building next to McDonald's on Buffalo and Charleston."}
{"text":"the staff here is super nice. i love that they greet everyone as they come through the door. the food is super good and you know its made to order because it takes a bit before they bring it out to you. i had the gyro and steak souvlaki combo...Mmmm Mmmmm! i also shared some greek fries with my friend. nice portions. it definitely fulfilled our craving for greek food. =)"}
{"text":"The Big Fat Gyro is ridiculously big and fat....their Greek salads are fresh and delicious...add steak, chicken, or gyro meat for a reasonable price...hummus is smooth and silky...my only complaint is that street access to the place totally sucks and the parking is very limited. Otherwise, great!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in Vegas. Family owned atmosphere. Great service. Excellent ambiance. Fresh ingredients. What more can I say about this place it's the best"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Their avgolemono soup is amazing. All I want is a piece of Galaktoboureko and I would be one happy girl!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves) in Las Vegas. And I've tried them in every Greek restaurant I've been to. Their Avgolemono soup is delicious as well.   The service is great too. Everyone is friendly and they even remembered me after coming in only once. And they were crowded that day.   So between the service and food quality, I think I've found my go-to Greek restaurant when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"OMG!!! there gyros are filled with so much meat and other stuff. i went two time in two days, i couldn't get enough of the taste. Their Big Fat Gyro is so good and pita bread is real tender. this place is so busy all the time and. staff is super fast and friendly, Absolutely great place to try!! feel the real Mediterranean taste!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Possibly the best Gyros sandwich I have ever had! I am always looking for a delicious, traditional Gyros sandwich. This one delivered! It was extra messy and I loved it! The Greek fries were good, but not great. I have had better, but I would/will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Whatever I order,  it's always delicious and fresh.  I think the old guy with the grey frow is the owner and  he is still cooking."}
{"text":"great food, nice staff, clean place, pretty Greek décor, amazing gyros and reasonable too. love it! I'm not sure if the curly haired guy is the owner but he's very nice, always asking if we're doing ok or if the food is good. I believe I saw him catered at the recent Greek festival as well. overall, this is my main go to Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my neighbor this afternoon for an early dinner.  I had the Chicken Souvlaki and she had the Gyro plate.  We each requested no rice and extra salad and they were very accommodating.  Their tzatziki was excellent.    My only complaint with any place like this is the plastic plates and dinnerware.  I know it's common in places like this, but it still is something I don't like.  I brought home a piece of baklava for dessert, and it was quite good.  I will be back.  I'll probably do takeout the next time."}
{"text":"Great quick place to stop for lunch. Since my friend lives in Vegas now, we actually get to try local spots and not just touristy central. She suggested a gyro place, and I was in. I opted to keep it simple and tried a gyro sandwich with everything. Overall, good amount of meat and flavor. The taziki sauce was what I'd expect, but it could have used some more. Luckily my husband got his on the side so I used some of his. We also got hummus as a side. Pita bread was warm and fresh. Service was friendly and nice, with staff greeting everyone as they walk in."}
{"text":"Family owned delicious food... I'm really obsessed with the athenian veggie plate right now, but the steak Souvlaki is absolutely out of this world too.  Everything's so fresh and filling... Its not cheap, but definitely worth the price especially for the amount of food you get.  Yum yum yummy.  oh and try their greek fries... SO good...  I crave this place."}
{"text":"I am not an expert in Greek food, but what I do know is that this place is delicious!   Boyfriend and I usually get the gyro plate, but we've tried a few different things and no matter what we get its always soooo good and very filling.    I especially like the fluffy bread and the rice they give you with the combos, helps tie all the flavors together. Portions are generous and everything we've tried always has great flavor.   Let's not forget how friendly the people are, especially the man with the glasses who we think is one of the owners. He's always upbeat and welcoming when we come in that I feel very comfortable being there.   I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to try some delicious Greek food at a reasonable price! :)"}
{"text":"Good portions, good price, for good food.  I go to lunch here a few times a year as it is closer to the office than Paymon's.  If I am looking for speedy greek food, this is the place to go.  Stick with Gyros salad or Gyros and fries and you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Got a lemon herb gyro it was bursting with juices herbs veggies and just plain great we also got a gyro plate with a very flavorful dressing for the salad rice really complemented the gyro meat the tzaziki sauce was very good only complaint is a very small piece of pita needed more"}
{"text":"I love my Greek food!  Yassou doesn't dissapoint.  After trying multiple dishes at this location I have settled on the Souvlaki Combo, delish.  You get your chicken and steak kabob's, salad, rice, pita/hummus.    I usually come in an hour or two before closing and the food is still up kept.  My Souvlaki Combo never dissapoints, either protein is always cooked perfectly.  One time they were out of rice and offered Greek fries as a substitute.  It was not bad at all but I like the rice better. The dining area is usually kept clean but there's not a lot of seats inside.    There was nothing unusual about the place or food except for maybe the restrooms.  They're not gender specific so pick and choose one without feeling weird about walking into the wrong bathroom.  Deserts:  Baklavah, really good.  I had to stop eating it because I didn't want to have a heart attack afterwards during work!"}
{"text":"I don't often eat Greek food even though I really do like it.  Glad the stepdaughter introduced us to Yassou!  Good Greek food right off of Charleston near Summerlin.  Lots of folks visit, can tell you're in the affluent part of town because of all the cars parked outside!  Our lowly Acura was parked between a new BMW and a Mercedes coupe.  Dang did that make me feel poor.  Oh well, suck it rich people I can eat at Yassou too!  Upon entering the restaurant, it definitely reminds you of the diner from that movie \"My Fat Greek Wedding\".  White & blue dually represented!  Nice little family run place.  Wasn't particularly busy in the place that day, noticed that lots of folks were doing take-out, or picking up large catering trays for glitzy parties.    Menu is displayed prominently on huge boards right above the service counter.  Kinda hard to miss!  Menu was varied, went from traditional Greek fare to items of a more modern palette.  We of course, stuck with what the Greeks know.  And what they know is pretty darn tasty.  Throw the spanakopita, dolmades, and hummus aside...show me the meat!  Although I'm sure those items on the menu are probably pretty good, I was here for some carnivorous action.  The wifey and I went for the Souvlaki Combo - one beef and one chicken skewer marinated in the house lemon herbs & spices.  Our plates came with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce.  Overall the plate was good.  The skewers were a nice serving, and you could definitely taste the lemon and herbs throughout.  My beef skewer was juicy, but the chicken skewer was a little dry probably because it was breast meat (which tends to dry out).  The Greek salad was good with feta, tomato, cucumber, olives, and lots of red onion (which the wifey didn't really like), topped with their house vinaigrette.  Tasty.  Pita bread and the tzatziki sauce was good too, pita being warm and soft, with the tzatziki being a good complement for dipping things in to.  I wasn't a fan of the rice pilaf though, it didn't do much for me.  It's probably because I'm more of a sticky rice kinda guy.  Overall a decent plate.  What I really should have ordered was what our kids ordered.  I almost wanted to switch halfway though our meal!  They got the popular My Big Fat Gyro - gyro sandwich with flame broiled sliced beef & lamb, feta cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.  Along with a large order of Greek fries - fries with herbs & spices, and feta cheese.  This stuff was delish!  The thin sliced beef with the lamb, all combined into that gyro made a wonderful dish.  Was hard to put down after a few bites!  I will definitely have this instead the next time I visit Yassou.    Prices were kinda on the high side for me (I'm a cheapie eater) but I guess if you want quality food you gotta pay for it.  Our plates were about $9 each, and the gyros were a tad over $7.  Fries were separate, and cost us another $3 or so.  Servings were generous though.  On the plus side, they serve Coca-Cola!  Figure it would have been Pepsi since of the blue motif and all.  The restaurant has two different seating sections, one is in the restaurant, but there is another area on the outside in more of a patio setting.  Nice if the weather is good outside, or if you have a large party of folks with you.  I'll be back.  OPA!"}
{"text":"I Yelped this place before I took off for my trip to Las Vegas and I was determined to get here, even though I was dead tired from the drive and it was a little ways from my hotel. I ventured out and I`m really glad I did. This place is really good and hit the spot. I was looking for something quick yet fresh and healthy. I came to this little spot and was not disappointed.   The front counter person greeted me when I came through the door and took my order right away. I knew exactly what I wanted because I had been stalking their menu for several days online. I opted for their Greek salad with herb lemon chicken and a side of fries. Regular, please. I said \"regular\" and the guy corrected me and said \"American\". Potato. Poe-ta-toe. I didn`t want Greek fries that day, I`m sorry. Next time for sure.   I did have to wait a little while for my order(I ordered to go) but I didn`t mind. They were busy and I like places that are busy because it usually means that it is good. The salad to go container was filled to the brim with goodness. The salad was really amazing and they gave me TWO dressings(Thank you for not being cheap!). I thought it was really tasty and I wish I had one right now because I`m hungry. I want to go back and check out the rest of their offerings when I`m in town.  Go here. Go Greek. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered through door dash.  Delish! I love Greek food and I had been craving the lemon chicken soup for so so long. Wasn't disappointed.  Also grabbed some Greek fries and rice pilaf.  Yummmm"}
{"text":"The 2 stars, \"Meh.I've experience better\" cannot be more appropriate. I order the 2 vegetarian meal and pick around what had no dairy. The rice was very blend with no flavor and the hummus was very liquid.This not was I was expecting since the reviews were pretty good in general. The service was good and the person at the cash register were very smiley. Unfortunately I cross it from my list and I will not be back."}
{"text":"A bit expensive.  Service is slower than average, but the food is really good.  Gyro patter is good.  I especially like the rice.  The salad is also very good.  Domadas are very tasty - especially with the lemon dipping sauce.  The place is quite large, and seems clean and airy."}
{"text":"Delicious, drool inducing Greek yumminess. Decent prices and really freaking good food! Nicely air conditioned, pleasing aesthetics. I suggest the combination Souvlaki plate."}
{"text":"What a waste of 40 minutes. . My husband asked where our order was and they said it was coming out next. 15 minutes later, still no food. Gave our order to some other table. Asked for our money back then left. Can't say if the food was good since we never got to try any. Will NOT be going back - even for take out. This is my first negative comment about a restaurant on yelp. I always like to write about great service and food only but I'm fairly pissed that no one there really cared. Need more employees to handle the crowds."}
{"text":"Money.  For $7.95, I had a beautiful plate of Greek goodies.  Chicken Souvlaki lunch special gets you a fresh greek salad (the Kalmata olives are not pitted.  Don't crack a tooth!), 3 or 4 pieces of hot pita bread, a skewer of chicken and onion pieces which are really well seasoned, and some of the best rice pilaf I have had in a while.  A fountain drink adds $2 to the total, but for $10, I left very satisfied.  Lest I forget, there is a quiet little patio if you go through the restaurant.  Service was passeable, if not overly friendly.  Interior was clean and lots of lunch regulars.  Can't wait to go back when I am off the wagon and try the Greek fries!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and was quite pleased with the service and food quality. We tried the Greek salad, humus, and two gyro specials.   All the dishes were tasty, showed some pride in presentation, and exhibited a nice mild blend of Greek flavors.   The food tastes clean and fresh.  The meat was evenly cooked and lightly seasoned.    Overall this is great place for a healthy, filling lunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I'm from Chicago and its been hard to find a good gyro out in Vegas. Everything on the menu is delicious! Their hummus, gyro, saganaki, all the best! But besides the food the owners are super friendly and nice. We were referred by Pete and while we were there all we saw was him interacting with customers, cooking, helping everyone out, and working hard! For me personally besides the food, good customer service is very important to me. I love small businesses and I prefer going to a family owned place over a chain restaurant. My mom works at a local Walgreen's and had Pete as a customer who told her about his store and that's how we ended up learning about it. While my mom lives in Summerlin i live in Seven Hills and I can honestly say I will make the drive to get take out/dine in again. Its businesses like this that will make it very far :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I have worked in the same plaza as Yassou for a good 2 years and STILL manage to crave Peters cooking daily. It doesn't matter what I'm ordering it is never anything short of amazing. Everyone who works here always makes sure I am well fed and taken care of. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a delicious lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is Greek food!  Excellent food, fast service, friendly staff. Prices are good for what you get"}
{"text":"Came to try this place for the first time.  The food was really but really good !!!  The chicken was cooked soooo good, not dry but well done.  This place is my new favorite  and I do recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. I ordered the Souvlaki Combo (beef and chicken skewers with greek salad, rice pilaf and pita bread). The beef and chicken skewers were seasoned well. The beef could have been more tender. The pita bread was my favorite. Very fresh and soft. The thing that ruined it for me was the rice pilaf. This is the first time I have ever been served yellow rice with a greek dish. I would eat here again, but would pass on the rice. Maybe try a gyro instead."}
{"text":"My wife heard about his place from a friend. Being part Greek I have yet to find a great place serving authentic taste! Until now! This place was great! Food was perfect and atmosphere was quaint and family friendly. Felt at home and very relaxed. Could tell from the moment I walked in food would be perfect as Owner was at front counter greeting you as you walk in and working his restaurant. A lot of love, pride, and hard work goes into this place.  Great food, great place! Will be back soon!  OPA!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'm so sad I don't eat here more often ... the food is amazing, you have to try their banana passion fruit smoothie its amazing ( I believe thats what I had lol). I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here all the time from across town. Good vegetarian options for me, fresh food and big portions. Family-run restaurant so that's a plus too!"}
{"text":"How can I express my love for Yassou's?!?!   I love everything I have ever tried there and the staff always makes you feel welcome when you come in.  It almost feels like you are walking into a street cafe in Athens.  OPA!   I have tried a lot of things on the menu and everything is always great.  The meals are all big and will definitely fill you to the brim.  The appetizers are a decent size and easy to share.  The hummus here is really, REALLY good too!  Always a good sign for a Greek joint.    And the gyros....Oh the gyros!  I think they have the best Gyros in town hands down. In fact I often dream about the Big Fat Gyro and always wake up happy just thinking about. If you haven't been yet, go RIGHT NOW and get one, maybe two!  The meat is tender and packed with flavor!  The pita is so soft and fluffy. And the tzatziki sauce is amazing!  Yum, yum, yummy!  So the moral of the story is if you want some great Greek food, get to Yassou's now!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Greek food my wife and I have experienced in a while. It was all home made and tasted excellent.   Recommend to anyone who wants to experience home cooked Greek food. Not only is it Greek it is Great."}
{"text":"IMO this is one of the very best Greeks I have ever been to, and I've been to plenty in England and here in Vegas.  Here's what I think makes it stand out:  1) It's a family run business with the owner always on hand to make sure the quality stays perfect and consistent.  Everybody we have dealt with there has been super friendly and makes us feel at home.  2) I know, it's really all about the food.  Well everything we've had here has been great:    Everything is made to order, so when you get the chicken or steak kabob, it's not been sitting around then zapped in the microwave like some places I've been to, instead it's cooked perfectly on the grill, the chicken moist and tasty (I recommend you squeeze a bit of extra lemon on it for a final taste burst), the steak unbelievably tender and cooked about medium rare for a fantastic juicy chunk of meat you'd be happy to find in your best steak house.  The donner kebab is nicely browned on the outside and very tasty; I've been to far too many places where they don't make the effort to brown it before slicing it off, it makes a huge difference to the taste when it's done right.  The rice is super moist and flavorful, I imagine they are cooking it in some sort of broth.  The side salad on the plate has a nice amount of dressing and a good variety of feta, olives (but only a couple), cucumber and onion to go with the lettuce.  The pitas are not home made (there are hundreds of them on display in packages) but they are very yummy, more doughy than the usual thin ones.  If I had one recommendation I'd like the option to have them warmed on the grill.  I think the prices are extremely reasonable considering the large portion size.  Friendly family run business, reasonable prices, great food.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is clean and bright, nicely decorated and seemingly well managed. I went here for lunch with a bunch of other ladies for a meetup group last Sunday. Whoever got there first was to find seating for all of us to sit together. There were 14 of us. My friend and I were the first to arrive, so took a look around and saw that there are three options for seating. Most people sit inside which is the same place as where you order (at the counter). But they also have an outdoor patio and a separate dining room enclosed in glass which was not open. So I asked if we could all sit in that room and they said sure and opened it up for us.  We were able to get about 4 tables put together where we all sat in a row on each side of the tables and on the ends. They brought everyone's order out to us in a reasonably consistent time. We didn't wait too long for the food either. No one had any problems with their order as far as I could tell and we had a great time with great food. Lots of the ladies were saying the food was very good.  Personally, I ordered the Super Lemon Chicken Pita. It is the larger of the two Lemon Chicken Pitas but not much more money that the smaller one. It was delicious. I forgot to tell them no onions, so I picked off the slices of red onion. I was glad they were not chopped fine!  When we left, they were loading up a van for a big delivery of food. I was impressed that they handled all of us unexpectedly at the same time they were preparing a catering job. And just as they did with us, they brought the food out to the van quickly with several people carrying things out.   I would not hesitate to return here or recommend it to anyone. Great place and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Huge gyro... really good feta and cucumber sauce...but when I see packaged store bought pita... instead of homemade? It is really a turn off especially for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Yassou's is one of my favorite Greek places in town. The gyro meat is the absolute best. I drive across town just to get the Greek pasta. Only other place I had the pasta was when I was in Greece. The staff is incredibly friendly. It's a great atmosphere and most importantly great food. You can't go wrong with coming here."}
{"text":"This family owned cafe is so laid back yet serves amazing food! I love coming here even though I live all the way from the South! The owner is so friendly, the food is so great & the portions are perfect! Salad is phenomenal! I have been coming here for 3 years!"}
{"text":"This family run restaurant is great! It was our first time so we asked for help and we received great suggestions. Food was fresh, fast and full or flavor. Lunch rush gets a little crazy but there is plenty of seating outside."}
{"text":"Three words....Chicken Lunch Special =) Yum! My daughter & I have been here several times, and even though we say we're going to try something new, we always end up ordering the chicken lunch special.  It just taste so good! =) Food is fresh and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place was very great. It really added to our Vegas experience. There was a very authentic feel here. The music, the food, the decor, and so on. The use of space was very much appreciated. Totes yummy."}
{"text":"I used to frown when friends would suggest eating greek food.  Till now.. Thanks to Yassou I enjoy greek food. The Lunch Special is a bargain!  Try it! The works and the owner are nice and don't seem to mind being asked question about their food."}
{"text":"My favorite affordable Greek food in Vegas, so satisfying I've never looked to venture past Yassou. We always order the \"My Big Fat Gyro\" or the Gyro Plate. So much meat! I'd recommend one of these your first visit because I believe you can soundly judge a Greek joint by its gyro.   The plate is fun, but the gyro wrap is hands down the best beast you'll wrangle during your work week. They are massive. And I can't believe I'm saying this since I know it's an abomination, but sometimes I find myself picking out slices of meat there's just so much. Seriously, I have to prepare before ingestion, like putting down newspaper or eating outside near the hose. My husband can go to town on it without much of a mess, but he has man hands and a man mouth.   The traditional gyro meat is a shavers gift--how gyros or shawarma should come off (if you ask a foreigner like me), consistent like meatloaf. I'm always prepared to get one bad piece, just one. Maybe a piece of fat or ligament, but nope, hasn't happened yet.   We call ahead and do takeout most of the time, and probably won't change the routine up anytime soon. Can't beat these prices. Cheap greek!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite places to eat! Food is so good and the people are super friendly. Even my kids love it!"}
{"text":"I had just finished my final and was hungry for something other than the burgers and tacos that plague Las Vegas Strip malls.   A quick look on Yelp showed me a highly rated Greek gyros about 10 minutes away. Hell yeah!  I arrive but realize the private parking is on the other side of the building. I parked by McDonald's but it was a 30 second walk to the restaurant.   I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff member who explained what the Greek Fries were and the combos and stuff. The Greek Fries are worth the extra dollar and change. I finished the fries before even touching the gyro. The whole meal was about $12 for a really good gyro (not too soggy, plenty of lamb or whatever meat, fresh lettuce, and onions mmmm), the awesome Greek Fries, and a fountain drink.  The atmosphere is great too. I enjoyed the Greek music and look/cleanliness of the establishment. There's an area outside and a closed off area.  I didn't see the bathrooms but I bet they're clean too.   Overall, really great experience. Excellent staff, good food, and decent prices ($7.89 I think for just the gyro).  I'd definitely come a lot more if I didn't live on the other side of town!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service where food is phenomenal and prices that cannot be beat.  Quality authentic food that has me coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"First of all, i go to Yassou ALL THE TIME. The reviewers here that say this place is bad either A- Dont know good food or B- Have their own Greek place and want more business. The Big Fat Gyro @ Yassou is not only the best in L.V, it is the best PERIOD. If you want Greek fine dining go to OPA, but if you want a cozy lunch Greek grill, it gets no better than Yassou."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has the best chicken, Greek salad and rice I've ever had....My mouth waters just thinking about it"}
{"text":"Best gyro in Las Vegas.  The meat has so much flavor and is so soft and crispy.  The pita was also soft and the tzatziki is very good. Fresh vegetables on it also.  Very very good.   My wife also ordered a salad, which she liked.  I ordered spanakopita.  I wish the phyllo was a little more brown. It was very pale and didn't have that great of a crunch.  The spinach and feta mixture inside was good.  Not great, but good.   I will be back when I get a craving for a gyro."}
{"text":"if you want experience a family run Greek restaurant this is the place to go. it is by Summerlin area, ample parking and very friendly staff. the food is fresh, delicious and good  portions.  restaurant is clean and gives you the Greek vibe with all white interior with lots of Greek photos and accent pieces. The prices ranges from about eight dollars to about $12 which slut bag. check out this place with your family."}
{"text":"Very good Greek food.  Plastic plates and utensils do little to decrease the pleasure of their friendly service, well prepared food and very reasonable prices.   A must if you're in the area - but also worth a drive.   Go."}
{"text":"This place is soooo freaking goood!!!! I always get the chicken place, with rice, salad and pita bread. Can't go wrong with it, always very filling leaving leftovers for later. Just not a big fan of their beef. Call and pick it up because most of the time is busy."}
{"text":"We have been to Yassou a few times now and we love it. The owner is super nice and very helpful describing the different kinds of food if you're not familiar.  The food itself is amazing. Full of flavor and served in a timely fashion. This place has not disappointed at all. We are making this one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"Came in here today for the first time and WOW!! I don't know too much about Greek food and the boy Jackson and the counter was extremely helpful and guided me through the menu and gave me his personal recommendations of what to try. When my food came out I was very impressed with how great everything tasted. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Tasty Greek food. Not the best but I could def eat 2+ days in a row!"}
{"text":"Ate at yassou today for the first time with a couple of friends of mine that raved about it.  I'm hooked now!!!   I had the Souvlaki combo and it was delicious!!!!!   The rice pilaf was fantastic, and the hummus and tsatiki was phenomenal!  My friend had the Veggie plate, and I think I might have to get that next time.   The Rice Pudding for dessert was EXCELLENT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were out running errands on a Saturday and had watched \"Mama Mia\" the night before, so were in the mood for some good Greek food! We did a search on Yelp, read the reviews and found Yassou! I was interested in the Souvlaki Plate and the guy taking our order pointed out a special that was less expensive and was a smaller lunch portion - which was exactly what I was looking for! The platter contained a skewer sampler of chicken, steak and pork and I asked for double greek salad instead of rice. All the meat was cooked nicely and seasoned well. The salad was fresh, the pita was fluffy and tzatziki was delicious. Hubby got the Big Fat Gyro and said that it was tasty and satisfying. We were too full for the Baklava but saw it and will have to give it a try next time! I highly recommend this if you are in the neighborhood and need a satisfying Greek lunch or snack!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek food in the city, but the hours are a disappointment. Who closes at 8 p.m. in Las Vegas? Do they not want to make money? If you do catch them open, try the lemon-herb chicken pita or any salad here. Delicious. The restaurant itself is charming and Mediterranean, in a family-style way. A bit cluttered and campy with mass-produced copies of old Aegean art and the de rigueur travel posters, but the staff is warm, welcoming and willing to accommodate any special request.  The only disappointing item on the menu is the baklava. It's among the worst I've had anywhere - shocking, considering these folks know, and produce, great Greek food. They should change the baklava immediately. It's a gaping hole in an otherwise very solid bill of fare. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Still keep returning for their flavorful and stuffed gyro pitas. The tuna one is becoming another fave. You can see the owner cooking in the back. Clean kitchen. In and outdoor seating.  Go to cashier, order and pay for your food, self help your drink (they have fresh brewed iced tea) then wait at your table with your order number for your food arrival.  Easy parking. Dependable."}
{"text":"Very good! The products are fresh and tasty! The big fat gyros is sooo good! Try the baklawa! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss from the street. Cannot enter if west bound on Charleston. Not enough parking and small spaces. When it was my turn in line the cashier took order from people behind me. The guy and his pregnant wife ordered ignoring that I was in line ahead of them.  Perhaps I should have made a scene, instead I went back to the end of the line. I waited while five other people who were behind me ordered before me.  I ordered Gyros plate to go. Was $10.15 (included tax). Soda was $2! Are you kidding me? Hello, you are not on the strip. Food was mediocre. Nowhere near as good as Shish Kabob Cafe. I realize one is Greek and other is Armenian, but items on menu are similar. For dine in, Yassou serves food on disposable plates. Cheesy. I would describe as overpriced fast food.  I was not impressed and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"I wrote this review on Google but felt a need to stress how I feel on Yelp as well so here is my review:  Oh man!!! Words cant begin to express how excited I am to have found such an incredible greek restaurant. I just spent tons of time in Greece and didn't think I'd ever be able to recreate the experience of eating the most delicious, homemade, WARM dolmades. At first I ordered the lemon chicken salad which was to die for but then I figured I'd try an order of the dolmades. Best decision I've ever made! The food came out quick, was reasonably priced and truly outstanding. Jack was helpful, nice and answered lots of my questions. He was fantastic, polite and patient with me. What a great experience- can't wait to come here as much as possible and become a regular :) thank you for such a lovely and authentic meal."}
{"text":"Best tasting Greek Gyro in this part of town. Kabob was made with real tenderloin steak. Definitely puts Halal Guys to shame. You cannot compare the two! Highly recommended if you come for the food ."}
{"text":"I eat here almost 4 times a week! What's my order? \"Gyro-Chicken salad, meat well-done  to go!\" This is the best way to order, I know because I'm the \"DUKE\"  Chicken well done am I insane? No! Trust me when you order the chicken well done, it ends up being crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside because of the marinated lemon juice.  As for the Gyro being well done, that should be mandatory at all gyro places due to the questionable meat, but I make it a point to do so. Plus, i like my gyro meat that way because it ends up tasting like bacon.  \"To go\" because of the Panda Express rule. Your just get more and  It is served in a nice container with dressing on the side. If you order to eat there, it's served on a plate and the dressing is way too wet for the salad.     So the whole order is sort of like a chopped chicken salad with feta instead. I forgot about the small bits of fried pita that taste like heaven!"}
{"text":"Indoor/outdoor seating. Authentic Greek food with an authentic Greek vibe. Probably the best Greek salad with lemon herb steak I've ever had. Hummus and grape leaves are a 10/10. Great service as well, everyone has a sense of urgency and very friendly. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This little gem has been one of my favorites for years now. Wonderful service and even better food."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I think it is the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been to Greek places in several States and this place still is the best and the price is good too."}
{"text":"LEGIT!  I'm so happy to have found a go-to Greek restaurant here in Las Vegas. I like that it's casual and quick but you can opt to sit, take your time, and enjoy yourself if you'd like.   I called my order in for pick up and it was ready it about 10 minutes. For $26 I got the Big Fat Gyro with a side of salad/rice, the Gyro/Chicken Souvlaki combo, a side of Spanakopita, and a drink.   It was delicious and filling with enough to eat for lunch the next day. The chicken skewers is a definite recommendation as the chicken breast is so juicy, flavorful, and tender. The spanakopita side came with 2 large pieces which was very delicious.   They have a cafe to the side which I plan on trying sometime soon. I'll definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"We did end up returning to this place and, while the service and atmosphere did not change at all, we thought the food was very mediocre. This would include our rice, fries, grape leaves, and chicken. We have had better food elsewhere, which is really disappointing because we had high hopes for this place and were willing to drive across town to eat here. After a meal this time, we both looked at each other and asked what we thought? Independently, neither one of us wanted to return."}
{"text":"Why in the world did it take me 2 years to stop and eat there?!!!!  *smacking head*   AWESOME food and best gyros EVER!  The meat is mouth-wateringly delicious and tender and the pita is always very fresh.  We also love their baklava, saganaki (flaming cheese), Greek salads, and humus!  All spectacular!  All their staff is very friendly and always customer oriented.  Not once have I had a problem that wasn't addressed quickly and made right, all with a smile and an apology.  Definitely not the norm in this town!!  The only downside I see to this restaurant is that it's so popular that they need more room!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped back for another amazing lunch. After spending a couple hours waiting in a govmnt office and hungry when I left , I decided to stop at Yassou. I always receive a wonderful greeting from the gentleman with the glasses, he is so kind. I ordered the lemon chicken pita combo plate and was not disappointed at all. The salad was cold and fresh and the chicken was cooked to perfection without being dry. This restaurant is always clean or they are cleaning while I'm there. They take pride in keeping it, organized and clean. I like that in an eating establishment. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to my next lunch with you all. Thank you"}
{"text":"Order, take a number, and when ready they deliver to your unclean table. They have a clean charming window light room, BUT it's locked so you have to wait for a dirty table to open up. Food is tasty though, and complete with a thimble size serving of hummus."}
{"text":"The white guy behind the counter in front that packages up your food for take out is NASTY. he needs to stop touching his face, wiping his sweat, digging in his ears and touching his nose and mouth repeatedly w out washing. Just left the place and couldn't write this faster. I'm grossed out at his unsanitary methods. Great food, just a nasty ,dirty, sweaty, greasy guy giving it to you. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first discovered this Yassou through the entertainment guide. I started my order with the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) for $5.99. They serve them with a thick lemony sauce on top. It is different from how my mom makes it but it still tastes pretty good. I chose the Steak Souvlaki plate as my main entree ($10.99). The steak kabobs were excellent ! They are marinated in lemon and herbs. It is served with rice and a fresh salad. The rice has a lemony flavor to it. I liked this place so much I took my brother here because he always craves this type of cuisine. He also loves the food here !"}
{"text":"This is my first time yelping, but dear holy essence, this place is good.  I saw great reviews on Yelp and had to judge it.  I've had a lot of Greek food growing up and these people deliver.  Very fresh and tasty.  Fast, friendly, and perhaps cheesily but fittingly stylish.  Very impressed.  The standard lamb gyro platter was exceptional."}
{"text":"We've always enjoy the food here at the Yassou Greek Grill Cafe.  Got the Deluxe gyros & lemon herb chicken... also the Big fat gyro... Salad was very fresh & so was the meat... very tasty... Big servings, enough for 2! I have no room for the Baklava till later.... also they gave me a big portion of my favorite fries by following them in Instagram! :) this is the place you must go"}
{"text":"Hubs took me here for lunch with our little one.  I'm not all that familiar with Greek food, but after this, I can say I'm a fan.  I have eaten at another Greek place on the other side of town and that was good, this place it's even a wee bit better.    Since I had eaten prior to our lunch date, I told my husband that I would just share with him.  We shared a Gyro plate and baklava.  This plate was full enough for the both of us.  Lots of lamb and beef.  It comes with pita, rice, and greens.  The beef skewers had four large cube pieces and it was not over cooked, it was cooked medium well, just the way I like it.  Service was fabulous and as a matter of fact it was one the workers b-day, I think it was Mary.  Anyhow, if on this dude of town, this place has some really good, healthy grinds!"}
{"text":"The meat on both of our plates were raw. Bright red in the middle. Customer service was rushed and wanted us out because they wanted to close. Not a good experience and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fat Big Greek gyro with a Greek salad for lunch. I had high expectations for this place because of the reviews and crowded restaurant. Unfortunately they were not met. They used white onions rather then purple on the gyro, wasn't too fond of that. The meat had no flavor and they provided very little tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"The Greek salad was amazingly FRESH and DELICIOUS!!! Loved the feta cheese! And the hummus and pita bread is to die for!!! The guy who took my order, who I believe is the owner; was so nice and polite! Thank you for an AWESOME experience! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk in is how clean everything is, as well as how good the food smells. We ordered gyros and the Greek fries. The food was great, everything tasted like it was made with fresh, quality ingredients. Service was above and beyond as well. So good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Greek Food in Las Vegas!!! Seriously the best ever! Whenever I get the cravings for Greek food or if anyone I'm with asks where to find good Greek food I always bring them here.   So if you've never been to Yassou and want recommendations on what to get I'll give you a few of my personal favorites.   As far as sides go, I always get either the Greek fries which are perfectly seasoned with big chunks of feta though out or my favorite the spanakopita which is perfectly flaky with the spinach always hot and the feta blended into it and melted all the way through. If you want to stay traditional then they have great hummus and soft pita as well.   On to the main course, I always get the super lemon herb steak pita which is amazingly tantalizing. The pita is always fresh and warm with tender with juicy bits of perfectly marinated steak and chunks of ripe tomatoes and slices of onions and lettuce and feta. It comes with a slice of lemon. Sooooo good! Also the Chicken Souvlaki is pretty good too. But the pitas are always bomb!   For dessert I always get the baklava. Theirs is the best! Fresh honey dripping off every bite.   Like I said if you want the best Greek food than try Yassou. I think it's as good as it is because it's family owned and you can tell they really care about giving their customers the best food and service they can."}
{"text":"I wasn't even aware Gyros could get that big. Typically, I'm able to finish my lunches without getting a to-go box, but at Yassou is where I met my match. I guess now I have a snack for later. Vegas doesn't have a large choice of Greek establishments but if I were to choose one it would be Yassou. The Big Fat Gyro is pretty much all you need. I will definitely go back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek spot!  Their pita bread are delicious !  Souvlaki combo is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The best greek gyros I had. I'm from Europe where greek restaurants are everywhere and popular so I know what I'm talking about!! Go for the big fat gyros with extra feta and a tender and exquisite piece of baklava!   You welcome!!"}
{"text":"Expected so much more with the great reviews. Over 20 min wait on the food and the chicken souvlaki was extremely salty and seemed to be covered with a lot of vegetable oil. Greek salad was okay but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek spot in LV!!!   We always take our guests here and make frequent stops for our fix!! We always sit outside and love how they checked on us.  Order the Souvlaki plate or anything Steak!! Their meat never disappoints!!   Amazing food, service, people, and yup... Again... FOOD!!   Thanks Peter and Christian!!!  PS I want to touch your hair!!"}
{"text":"Yassou is our favorite place for Greek food! Here they make everything fresh as you order.  You must try their grilled meat plates  - served with salad, Greek rice, pita.  Their lemon soup is excellent!  Their calamari is yummy!  Ask for Christian or Mr Papas!  They treat their customers like family!! We eat here at least once a week.  Price is also very affordable."}
{"text":"Yassou has the best Greek food in town especially the Greek salad and the big fat gyro."}
{"text":"luv walking in this place. i always feel welcomed. i have gone to them since they opened. christian always makes you feel like family and we luv that pops is always on the line cooking. customer service is always at its best and it doesnt matter what you order because its gonna taste like it was made with luv and you're gonna fall in luv."}
{"text":"Best Greek food that I've had in town. I've been coming here for over ten years and I love it. The same family has been operating this restaurant for years and you can tell they pay attention to detail. My favorites include the hummus plate with the Gyro plate."}
{"text":"Yassou!!! We are very pleased with our choice to try this restaurant that we found on Yelp. We loved the gyro pizzzzzzzza, and the pasticio and dolmadas were just like our YiaYia makes. We had good, friendly service and a great lunch. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food. Only $50.00 for four adults and one kid with drinks. Plenty of food. We are from out of town, but will come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love eating here. I have been coming here for years now and they have never disappointed me. I don't think there is anything on the menu I haven't tried. Gyros, salads, pasta and pizza. Everything served here is fresh and awesome. Great customer service and great greek food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I felt bad about the stars on my last review. The gyro was good. But the service and experience needs a little work.  Maybe I came at a bad time on a bad day. I still think the prices are a little high compared to my regular place. I might try them again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie Spreads Plate and a side of Hummus... at the end of the meal I was left feeling \"meh\".    I glanced over the menu and picked from one of the two vegetarian options. I picked what I thought would have been the healthier of the two, Veggie Spreads Plate.   The Plate consisted of rice pilaf, greek salad, pita bread, two small stuffed grape leaves (I think it was grape leaves), and containers of spread.   Rice pilaf and pita bread dominated the plate, making it a hefty serving of carbs. In my opinion the rice pilaf was bland, lacking flavor. The greek salad was a ordinary salad, though the dressing was also bland. Keeping it consistent, the hummus was bland as well.   Like I mentioned in the beginning, I was left feeling \"meh\". I have definitely had better. Perhaps the positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers are as the result of meat plates?   As a vegetarian, this place definitely did not do it for me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Greek food. The food is amazing!  Always fresh and delicious!  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  I would highly recommend eating at Yassou!!"}
{"text":"The owner is awesome he is usually in the kitchen cooking and they get there gyros from Chicago.  They buy the most expensive cone (of Gyros Meat) and you can tell with taste.  If it is your first time go with the my big fat greek gyro and make it a combo with Greek fries.  It's the best gyros in Vegas hands down.  Other items on menu are good but take a little bit longer to cook.  They just upgraded by getting another gyros cone cooker to help with the increase of customers.  The word has gotten out this place is a hidden gem in Vegas.  If you are staying on the strip its worth grabbing it and taking it back to your room or suite like my friends did.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A fantastic mom & pop Greek joint. The ambiance is mellow and casual w/ a walk up counter and comfortable seating. The food came out quickly and was really fresh. I had the Gyro and my wife had the Souvlaki & Chicken skewer plate. We also had the Feta Fries. The meat was fantastic, the salad/veggies fresh and crisp, and the seasonings on everything spot on. Cheap, quick and tasty. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a lot of great Greek options hut Yassou just happens to be my favorite. I have regularly eaten here for 8 years and they have never let me down. I especially love the Big Fat Gyro with Greek fries and the Mini Souvlaki specials; both offer generous portions of fresh ingredients at ridiculously reasonable prices. The food is cooked fresh and lunch lines are long, so don't get frustrated when the food takes a few minutes to come out. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife and I luckily stumbled across this while visisting my Dad. All I can say is that it was the best greek meal either of us have had. The chicken was fantastic and the gyros as well. I recommend the beef and chicken kabob. Get the baklava as it is baked fresh (as is all their food) and is made from scratch on site. The owner was very friendly and accomodating.We went back the next day we liked it so mush.  My Dad loved the lemon chicken soup and like everything elseit is made from scratch. I don't know why they do not have a cafe n the strip. All thumbs up from both of us."}
{"text":"This place was great. Wait was a little long for lunch but that's because the line was out the door during lunch and my friend ordered the salmon plate. I got the gyro and feta fries. It's nice to have another good place for Greek food."}
{"text":"When I am craving Greek food, this is the place I come to. The Big Fat Gyro is the best Gyro I have had in town, not lacking in anything. Have you ever had a Gyro and thought that if it only had more of something then it would be better? Not the case here, the name explains it all. Its big, its fat, and it is yummy.   There are also a lot of other sandwiches stuffed and sides. My favorite side from here is the Dolmades. There were canned Dolmades on a shelf and I'm not sure if that's what they are serving but it definitely tastes better than any of the other places.  It's not the cheapest Mediterranean food joint but it the food justifies the prices IMO. So far I haven't had anything better along the lines of Mediterranean fast food so this is my top pick for now."}
{"text":"Yassou is a place I have visited many times over the past several years. I can always count on them having delicious gyros and fries. I love the My Big Fat Gyro and I order it without onions. My friend ordered his without tomatoes. I know, who doesn't like tomatoes? Haha.  I was a little disappointed the last time I was in there since they got both of our orders wrong. Not a huge deal, but definitely disappointing. I also asked for ketchup and they forgot it. It's the little things that make or break the experience at a restaurant. If they had been busy, I would understand. They weren't busy.   If I was reviewing the quality of the food alone, I would give them 4 stars. Due to the not so great service, I felt I had to deduct one star. Makes me sad, but I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yassou has the best Greek food in town and is family owned and operated, which is nice because everyone who walks in the door is treated like family as well. This is always my go-to when meeting friends for lunch. The food is always freshly prepared and affordable too."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in this part of town. Wife & I have been going here for at least ten years. The father (who cooks) and the son (who takes orders) are always so pleasent. Now to the food, always fresh,abundant, and tasty with reasonable prices. Get here before the noon rush as this place is popular."}
{"text":"so i tried this place twice just to make sure before my review. To me this place is just average. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. i just think the rating of 4.5 stars is a bit of an over reach. either people don't know what above average is or they have no taste. the first time was the gyro platter second time was the big gyro sandwich. Both times the meat was dried out,was not moist or tender and was just an overall uninspiring meal. I also don't like being nickle and dimed for extra sauce is it really gonna break you guys? offer a proper size of sauce with each meal then customers wouldn't need to ask for it and be charged 50 cents extra. I guess i have been exposed to much better and therefore I am more critical. It seems that in las vegas anything approaching average is considered out of this world,I have seen this at many restaurants here."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here. Everything is great! Food is fresh, fast, and delicious. Perfectly cooked gyro meat. Wonderful iced tea. The staff is friendly and completely on top of things."}
{"text":"By far my most favorite spot ever ! Their gyros are amazing the best I've ever tasted in my life!  The prices are amazing too I can never get enough of the food here.  The workers here are nice and welcoming as well !  I recommend everyone to go taste the authentic Greek food the chicken, gyro , everything is recommended!   Thank you so much for the delicious food."}
{"text":"This is our go to simple easy yummy favorite. Family favorite. And we love the sweet awesome workers. So happy to go there all the time. Bomb town chicken"}
{"text":"Omg! Soo good. I came here on recommendation from a friend. I will definitely come back. Go the gyro plate.  It comes freshly sliced gyro meat with buttery and lemony rice pilaf and a salad with feta cheese sprinkled on top. Around $10. The portion is large enough for two to share. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices on all of the traditional Greek stuff! And I've always had great experiences with people working there. And it's a great deal for the quality and portions!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved to Vegas, over 10 yrs now. I've tried different items but my Favorite is their Greek Salad, Just Love It!!They always have tasty food and great service. Definitely recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"My favorite for Greek food with a diner atmosphere and low overhead pricing.  Sometimes there is a wait as the food is made to order, but it's worth it.  Some items are prepared ahead of time and reheated to order (saw the moussaka taken from the fridge/freezer and reheated) but still made from scratch and delicious."}
{"text":"Was on my way to Red Rock Canyon when I stumbled across this spot. Don't be fooled by the modern, chain-looking exterior. This is about as authentic a Greek dining experience you'll find (and as someone who lives in NYC, that says a lot)..  I ordered the big fat gyro and rice/greek salad. With a fresh iced tea, the total was $11, a true bargain. Also of note, the staff (from the son at the register to the owner, exactly as you'd picture a Greek chef, working his magic in back, to the pleasant food runners) couldn't have been better.  The food: the gyro literally is big and fat, but the perfect combination of meat (beef & lamb), veggies, tzatziki and feta. It's not too big that you can't pick it up, but literally perfect. A top 5 gyro among the many I've eaten in life. The salad and rice was good, but nothing too special. The Greek fries I saw headed to other tables looked delicious, but you need to draw the line somewhere.  Overall, amazing food, great staff and more. Do yourself a favor and eat here if you're ever nearby!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Vegas!!! The Papas family always delivers. Can't go wrong with any item you order.  Make it a must eat joint"}
{"text":"ok so I've only been here once but I'm already in love. We found this place w/ the Entertainment guide book. (and Yelp of course)   LOVE at first sight. The place is so cute and they have the greek music in the bkground so you feel like you're on the set of that wedding movie.   I ordered the souvlaki mini. Perfect for me. mini greek salad, a skewer of chicken, skewer of steak, rice, pita bread, that yogurt sauce and lemon.  I'd order that again in a heartbeat.   My bf went w/ the super lemon chicken pita sandwhich and it was to die for. I loved it. even just the one bite, I'd drive all the way bk from Henderson /Green Valley just to order that.   After reading the reviews the only thing we knew for sure was we were going to order the greek fries. eh. that was the lowest rated item I tried. Nxt time I go I'll get the lemon pita and a baklava."}
{"text":"GREAT Greek Food.  The kabobs and the gyros are delicious!!  The meat is always perfectly cooked, and the rice is my absolute favorite!  Everything is always fresh.  Never had a bad experience.    Very friendly staff, you can tell it is family owned.  It's the perfect place for takeout... call in your order, because this place gets busy!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Greek food!! I love their  vegetarian options.  I love the veggie pita, the Greek fries and the spanikopita(spinach) plate, ooh and the Greek pizza.  Everything is so fresh.  The salads are green, the salad dressing is very tasty, everything doesn't taste like it's just been sitting out all day, then warmed up.  Oh, and i love the cucumber dipping sauce that comes with the spanikopita...It's da bomb.  By the way, the prices are great.  Any time, a meal for 2 is about $20... that's a deal in my book!! Oh and omg, I forgot to mention their baklava.  I think it's the best in town, ever.  So good, that I ordered a pan of it for my bday party.  It was a hit and they made the whole process of it very easy.  I just had to return the pan the following day and got my deposit back for it. The owner, the son and the staff are very friendly and they take pride in their business.  They know their customer's faces and names.  Since I live close, I'm kind of a regular, haha.  I also love taking my friends and family who are from out of town to this place.  They always tell me how good the good is and how fresh it is.   Give it a try, even the vegetarian menu, I know you will like it too!!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Greek food, but I've had my share of souvlakis.    I ordered the Steak Souvlaki ($8.99) from their lunch special menu from 11 am to 4 pm.  It came with a side salad, rice pilaf, and pita bread.  There were four pieces of meat skewered along with a side of tzatziki sauce.  First off, I think I was expecting something else.  I was expecting more of a souvlaki wrap, as this is how I used to have it.  So that part was different for me.  It was okay, nothing spectacular though.  (I soon learned that most souvlakis served here are with pita bread, and not wraps.  So I'll have to keep my eyes out for that.)  The Husband ordered the Moussaka \"Ground beef, eggplant, and potatoes layered and topped with Bechamel sauce\" ($8.99)  It did sound a lot more appetizing and once I read it off the menu, he was easily sold.  It was okay and he said he's had better.  We also downed it with a Greek soda - blue raspberry.  Overall, Yassou Greek Grill Cafe was a decent Greek food experience.  You go up to the counter and give your order and pay.  They'll give you a number and you take a seat and your food will arrive a few minutes later.  They were pretty busy the weekend we went, so they are doing okay.  It didn't have me screaming for more though."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way, I don't eat here enough. The food is delicious and the quality is great. I love how passionate the father and son are about running this business. They're always working hard to keep the food flowing and the restaurant clean.   My only problem is deciding what to order! I usually end up getting a gyro, lemon herb chicken salad, or the mini souvlaki special. There were a few occasion that I noticed the meat was ever so slightly on the dry side. More of an observation than a complaint, nothing that a little lemon or tzatziki can't fix. Everything is well seasoned and flavorful. I'll have to come back more often."}
{"text":"Food was so good!!!! The Greek salad was well dressed and the feta cheese was a good amount.  Service took awhile. I do understand it's a Friday during lunch time. 30 minute wait for a salad.  I definitely will come back to try their other good looking foods :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everytime I go I get a consistently tasty gyro. The staff is always friendly and food is always great. This is my favorite spot for gyros in Vegas."}
{"text":"Still love love love the food here.  I've yet to branch beyond the Mini Souvlaki Special (one mini steak skewer, one mini chicken skewer, rice, salad, pita, and tzatziki sauce), with a side of Greek fries, because it's sooooo delicious and filling. It's great when dining in, and even better when I send my partner out to bring it home.  Yassou has become my go-to takeout spot for nights when I'm feeling too lazy to drive or cook! I'm posting a photo of the up-to-date menu, since it's not available on line."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Grateful that Yelp friends J. and C. introduced me to this place.  Fell in love after one meal.  The Greek Fries covered in spices and feta cheese were SO good.  Nicely crispy and perfectly complemented by the spices and LOTS of feta cheese.  They went perfectly with the equally tasty Olympic Veggie Pita.  Soft drinks are self-serve and refillable, a plus on hot days.  Parking is ample in the lot but might not be able to park right in front of the restaurant.  Dine-in space is more than you'd expect from looking at the place from the road but probably gets completely full at peak lunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"I love this place the only thing is I wish it was closer to my house. But, whenever I am in the area and hungry I come here. Everything is made to order and great quality."}
{"text":"Pita and humus was really good!  I had the Athenian plate.  Lots of food. I was looking for a different Greek restaurant and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing!!!! My favorite is their mini slouvaki combo which includes rice, salad, chicken, and beef skewer! It's so filling and tastes amazing. The prices here are so reasonable and everything is quality. The only thing is, ask for your pita on the side. I had two orders, one was stale and inedible and my other one was soft warm and fluffy.   This place is tucked in on charleston and buffalo, and is always filled with hungry customers! The staff here are really nice and the menu is quite large. Overall one of my favorite Greek places."}
{"text":"BF were in the area and hungry so I popped in on Yelp to find a place and Yassou came up.   I also saw that there was a coupon for $5 off $20 here: http://www.citycoups.com/yassougreekgrillcoupon.html so we were sold. When we got there, the lady at the counter is firm that you MUST print out the coupon off the website. Kinda a bummer considering I was already in front of their place, saw that ad and because of it decided to come in.   We shared-  Super lemon chicken pita sandwich ($6.79)- the difference with the super and regular lemon chicken is theres more meat and feta cheese in it. I think the super is the way to go since the feta helped meld the chicken, lemon, tzatziki all together. I think this is definitely something I'd get again and recommend getting here.   Gyro and Spanakopita plate ($8.59)- the gyro meat is pretty standard good, salad greens were fresh, pilaf is good, pita is soft. I appreciated that the spanakopita wasn't greasy, but it was just missing something for me so the plate over all was just okay.   It's order at the counter and find a seat so I don't have much to say about service other than what I stated above. Prices are reasonable and it's a cute little place If I'm in the area, I might stop in for that super lemon chicken sandwich but so far my overall impression is that this isn't I'd go drive all the way down for."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place EVER!  That is not a easy bar to clear because I had to opportunity to go to Greece while I was in the service. The food is so amazing I just can't keep myself from coming back! Additionally, the customer service is superb! The establishment is spacious and offers complimentary wifi. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Great place to go. Love it always.  Yum yum.  Best gyro shop in town.  Great stuff."}
{"text":"I went here because it was close my apartment. I had the big fat gyro special with greek fries and my girl got the spanokopita/gyro combo plate. We also ordered a side of hummus & a baklava. Total of all of that was just under $30.  Overall very disappointing, the spanokopita was just bland with crappy pastry, the greek fries had a pinch of herbs and feta and otherwise tasted worse than fries from burger king. The gyro sandwhich was ok but didn't stand out and the baklava was mostly pastry with little filling.  Every single one of these dishes is done better close by at Mad Pita Express on Durango between DI & Sahara with comparable prices. But by far the best greek place in town is The Fat Greek on Flamingo & Decatur. If you try the spanokopita at Yassou then go have the same thing at fat greek you will just laugh at the difference as it's not in the same universe.  Disappointing for sure. Save your time and go to Mad Pita Express or if you want to kick it up a notch Hedary's or Fat Greek."}
{"text":"Located off of west charleston just past buffalo. The food is great. Only been here twice and will definitely be back. You get lots of tasty food for your $$. I ordered the double chicken bob. Nice lemony tang and just the right amount of spice. Tender and juicy! Includes rice and Greek salad with pita bread.  5 stars! Check it out for lunch."}
{"text":"We went here one evening craving Greek food, saganaki in particular. We showed up 45 minutes before they closed and the employee didn't look too excited to see us. Most of the place was already cleaned up and closed off. We were a group of 8 and no one offered us help with seating as we struggled to drag tables together to accommodate us. We expected a dining restaurant with waiters and such, but this is more of a cafe feel where you order your food at the counter and then get your own beverages. They were out of saganaki. Sadness. But I ordered the Spanakopita Plate and it was enough for two people. And all of it was good. Looking at everyone's plates, portion sizes were a definite plus. While we were eating, several people came in to pick up carry out orders. We'll be back, hopefully on a day where they have Saganaki."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Layout and atmosphere are strange. Feels like they can't decide if they want to be a restaurant or a fast food joint. Not saying the food is that quality, just the look of the place makes it feel that way. Was not at all what I expected. Definitely more of a quick-casual place than a sit down lunch as I had expected.  Back to the food though. Ordered the \"My Big Fat Gyro\" and it was delicious. I wanted to get another one. Had Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese. Also comes with Tzaziki sauce but I'm not a fan of that so had them hold it. Didn't need it anyway.   Kacey ordered the Souvlaki Combo with Chicken and Steak. The chicken was really good. Steak was just ok I thought. A little tough for my liking but that may be the way its supposed to be made in that dish.  Thought about trying the baklava but it was just sitting out uncovered on top of a display cooler right next to a table where people were eating. I'll pass.  Service was decent for a quick casual spot. I'll definitely be back. They should really do some updating and freshen the place up a bit though."}
{"text":"Quality has degraded.  From souvlaki with juicy chunks of either beef or chicken interspersed with onions and green peppers, now there's grainy chunks of lower-quality beef and overcooked, dry chicken, one or two slivers of onion and no green pepper to speak of.  All we ever get is the souvlaki plate, but lately we're considering finding another place to order out.  Sad, because for years we got consistently delicious food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here over the weekend. We ordered the gyro plate comes with salad n rice. Always fresh. I love their Greek fries. It's all very delicious. The meat nice n tender the pita bread nice n soft. The owner is very friendly. He comes n say hi to his customers when he has time. I never had a bad experience. I will continue to come back. :)"}
{"text":"I can really appreciate some good Mediterranean food. Mediocre Mediterranean? Not so much... As far as it is from my house, I doubt I'll make the drive all the way out here any time soon.  KABOBS: Doesn't Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.  SIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I've eaten better at the greek festival.   The kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.  After this meal of good and bad, I'm kind've over Mediterranean food at this point. After finishing the whole meal, I couldn't substantiate that the $25 I spent plus gas was worth it."}
{"text":"If you love Greek food, this is certainly the place to sit down and enjoy with friends. The BEST gyro in Las Vegas.... I swear.... With a respectable price to accompany a large portion."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here all the time, and every time the food just wows us. Only thing we can complain about is the wait time for the food, but its because its cooked to order!"}
{"text":"Best Greek spot in Vegas!!!!  I come here at least once a week for lunch always consistent, good clean food!!!!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I feel it is necessary to begin my review of Yassou by mentioning that I may have a slight obsession with Greek/Mediterranean cuisine. I love everything about the food - plain and simple. To give some perspective, I eat Greek/Mediterranean cuisine 3 times a week on average; and I refuse to order from any other restaurant in this category. Why? Because Yassou has thoroughly impressed me every single time.  Let's start with service quality. I would give these folks 6 stars out of 5 if it was possible. From my understanding, Yassou is a restaurant run by multiple generations of a single family - a family that is truly passionate about what they do. As soon as you step foot in the restaurant, you get the feeling that every employee loves where they work. In a perfect world, every restaurant would evoke these sentiments in their customers. And how about the food? Outstanding food quality and generous portions makes Yassou my absolute favorite Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. Always fresh and high-quality ingredients make every dish a winner. I'm a huge fan of both the greek salad and the gyro + chicken kebab combo plate. The protein is perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor, and the rice is nothing short of delectable. Do yourself a favor and give Yassou a try!"}
{"text":"Easy 5 star....here's why :  Not only was it the best tasting gyro I have had to date, but it was one of the best priced lunches.  I went with the combo, gyro, fries, and smoothie shake for $10 and change.  The gyro was great...I think the feta cheese puts it on another level.  The fries were kind of plain...wish they had a sauce or seasoning....just get another cucumber sauce to dip the fries :)  The smoothie was surprisingly good...a nice touch, instead of offering a soda with the combo.  I would have went with water otherwise.  Also had a chicken pita sandwich...zesty lemon and herbs...also a good choice.  Can't go wrong here!  We will come back again!"}
{"text":"I was staying with friends in the area and wanted to try something different for dinner.  Thanks to Yelp with my search for a restaurant nearby, I found Yassou's.  My friend's meal was delicious as was my grilled chicken in a lemon marinate.  The grandson of the original owner came by our table to welcome us and to make sure we were happy with our food.  I wish I had a similar place like this back home.  The good news is that my friend, whom lives nearby, can't wait to bring her husband here, knowing he will love it.  And when I come back to visit, I will definitely be back to try another dish!"}
{"text":"Busy place! We ate here on a Tuesday around noon and the parking lot was full. Food took  a while to receive, but it was worth the wait. I ordered the Souvlaki combo - grilled chicken and beef skewers served with rice, greek salad, and tzatziki sauce. The total with a soda came out to about $13.00. The chicken and beef were seasoned very well, a little dry, but still very tasty. The rice was absolutely amazing though, full with flavor. My friend got an order of the greek fries and they are a MUST try! Super crispy and tasty fries. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was tired of McDonald's, Burger King, and all the other fast food restaurants I was eating from.  So, I yelped for places and found this with some good ratings and others not so good.  Needless to say, I had no expectations for this restaurant.  I figured anything that doesn't have anything to do with American fast food will be good for me.  Our order were as follows: 1.)  My Big Fat Gyro 5.79 Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese.  This was tasty and had a lot of flavor to it.  Because it was so fat, it was hard to put my mouth around it.  That didn't sound too good, should I have written this differently so it doesn't so graphic?  All jokes aside, this is definitely a no joke gyros. 2.)  Greek Fries  $2.69 I have had better greek fries.  For some reason, this was more bland than the other ones I've had in other restaurants. 3.)  Veggie Spreads Plate 7.49 A delicious assortment of Hummus, Tzakziki, Taramosalata & meatless Dolmades.   I felt this one was lacking something.  The rice was just so bored on its own, and I found the salad to be just okay.  Everything else on the plate was pretty good.  As for texture, there wasn't much added to it.    I rated it A-Ok because it's just that, A-Ok."}
{"text":"Went back on Sunday, the food was still delicious! You really get your monies worth of food here. I can't wait to go back. Actually I've been back about 5 times since my first review. The food is so good!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best quick Greek food in Las Vegas.  They also do the food at the annual Greek festival.  I love the gyro and rice.  The baklava is quite good as well.  The service is good and so are the prices.  :-)"}
{"text":"Yassou's is the place to get good Greek food.   They make amazing Spanakopita (spinach pie) and their lemon buttery rice is delish.   It took about 15  minutes for the food to be served but it was worth the wait. Prices are reasonable, $8 to $9 for a sure-to-fill entree. The staff was friendly and prompt.   Black and white checkered floor tiles, dainty Greek music, and abstract(-ish) paintings on the wall creates a friendly comfortable atmosphere in this little cafe.   If you're trying to fix a Greek craving, this is it."}
{"text":"Not enough can be said about this place. Upon first impression it's your very typical Greek cafe. Lots of blue and white tile. Greek music. Friendly staff. And awesome food.   My wife often makes fun of me when we go to Greek restaurants because I complain that they don't serve enough meat on their gyros or gyro plates. Not this place! It'd be fair to say that they even serve to much. I ended up forcing myself to eat all of the meat and left the trimmings because I didn't want to waste any of it. It's so good, that no matter how full I was, I still wanted to eat more.   I had the traditional beef and lamb gyro, and my wife and I split the gyro pasta. The kids had the beef skewers. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to come to this restaurant regularly about 10 years ago. It always served excellent Greek food and today for Fathers Day we were in the mood for Greek and thought we'd revisit...only to be really disappointed.   The first thing we noticed was how dirty the floor in the dining area was and the bathroom's poor condition. One restroom was out of order and the other was disgusting, in the most literal sense. It smelled very strongly of urine (it was so intense it actually reminded me of cat urine ) and the floor was covered in dirty marks, paper towels and long hairs. I have no idea how so much hair has accumulated in a restaurant bathroom unless someone literally washed, blow dried and styled their hair in there. Additionally, the bathroom hardware was dirty, rusty and in pretty bad shape.  Next we ordered our food and were surprised not to see any actual Greek ppl behind the counter or on the line. We always felt like we had a genuinely Greek experience when we previously came as the person at the til and the cooks obviously had either a hand in ownership or had a personal connection to Greek culture and cuisine.   As for pricing, we were expecting it to be slightly overpriced, as good Greek food can be. If you aren't eating at Del Taco, you can't expect those prices. Unfortunately, Yassou's prices no longer represent the freshness or quality of the food. The food came out very sporadically and some entrees took an exceedingly long time. There were 9 of us eating and all of our meals came out at different times, which is awkward for a family meal with kids who get their food last. I had requested that my Greek Fries be extra crispy and when they were delivered mine didn't look any different than the other normal Greek fries we had ordered. When I asked the food server about my fries' appearance she said that mine were definitely the extra crispy ones and that they all are, in fact, prepared extra crispy. It was a weird comment and didn't really make sense since none of the fries were very crispy anyway, but it was obvious that she didn't have much of a say behind the counter and was trying her best to help the customers in the dining room. The hummus portion was generous but only comes with 1 pita cut into very small triangles, so unless you plan to eat your hummus by the spoonful, you'll have request more pita. Lastly, the meat on my gyro plate was shaved very thinly and the slices were dried and hard before I was even half done. The only thing redeeming about our experience was the excellent customer service of the food runner. She was very friendly and helpful. Offering a cup lid for my young daughter's water and bringing extra napkins, etc. She was great. Overall, we are very disappointed in the current condition of what used to be a fantastic Greek meal AND experience in this part of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband introduced this place to me and I fell in love with it! After a few more times of coming here I brought my co-workers for lunch and they enjoyed it as well. I always get the lunch chicken special which comes with rice and salad. Tonight I tried the chicken gyro which was also really good. We also got to speak to the owner during this visit and he spent at least 15 minutes talking to us about how he got started in the business. Absolute pleasure to speak with! I would say we come about twice a month and have always had a wonderful experience. I really pay attention to customer service and this place has great staff!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I did order a gyro plate and it definitely wasn't a gyro. More like a deconstructed gyro? Pretty hard to eat. The food took a while to come out and there isn't any parking. It is definitely a family restaurant and I loved that!  The food is good but the inconvenience of the wait time and how hard it is to eat I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was going to this place since it opened. The owner is a great guy. His two sons are complete idiots who don't know the hospitality business. I always ate the same thing. I finally tried the hummus. It came with one piece of pita. I ate the pita and half the hummus was still on my plate. I asked the older brother for another pita slice. He says that will be 80 cents. That's it. You don't treat a good customer like that. I haven't been back. Now I go to Paymons every week. Better food. Better prices. And much better service"}
{"text":"Whew just finished my meal I got the mini souvlaki special which is one bee and one chicken skewer both with about 3 pieces of meat on it, salad and rice and a pita. I opted for no rice and double salad  It was so good the meat was so flavorful and neither were over cooked, the salad was so. Great too! I looked at other people plates and everything looked amazing! Will def come back!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food in town. Privately owned and not a chain. I go here all the time for the great quality and full menu."}
{"text":"I enjoy the little place and the location. I love that greek isle feel. I really enjoy the chicken pita here it is so flavorful. Love how you can taste the lemon. The only thing I don't like is the pita bread with the chicken platter because it is so bland but it does taste good when it's a sandwich. Lunch specials are pretty good here.  PROS: decor, location, and food"}
{"text":"I love this place! As a vegetarian they have a lot of options, but my favorite is the veggie gyro with Greek fries! Everything I've had here is delicious. The restaurant is clean and the service is great. I would definitely recommend it, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Peter and his family are the nicest people and make the best Greek food in Las Vegas!!! If you haven't been please do!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had the the lemon herb chicken pita. Very tasty. Lots of flavor. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from here a handful of times with the fam. Everyone is alway happy and well fed. I'll update the review when I finally eat in, that's the only reason I'm unable to provide 5 stars at this point. The Big Fat gyro is my fav. And the grape leaves are yummy as well. Everything is always put together well and appears fresh.   Totally worth a try if you're craving Greek!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got a combo for $11. It comes with a gyro, fries and a smoothie.  For my combo I picked Greek fries and strawberry banana smoothie. I've had my fair share of gyros in this town.  Gyro: Not as heaping with meat as my favorite gyro place in Henderson. The meat was more cooked and saltier than what I'm used to. I couldn't finish it. More tzatziki to mask the saltiness please. 3.5/5  Greek Fries: I love fries. Crispy, crunchy and hot with a little bit of feta cheese and parsley. Not the best Greek fries I've had but still good. They only give you a handful so you might want to order another side of fries. 4/5  Strawberry Banana Smoothie: This is absolutely great since I don't drink soda. They have strawberry, mango, banana, etc. I asked them to make strawberry banana smoothie for me if it wasn't too much of a hassle and they did. Yay!  5/5  But for what you get with the combo, it's definitely good value. I'd much rather drive 3 more miles to get here than eat at G Time. Plus, the service was great."}
{"text":"I use Pete for catering often!  The Greek salad is amazing, and he truly prepares the best gyro meat in town...the lamb is so tender and flavorful that it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious!! The service and the food is excellent and never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"What a nice Greek spot in the middle of the desert. For many years I would pass by this place but never got the chance to check it out. After work, I finally decided to complete another restaraunt that was bookmarked in my app for awhile. I'm so happy that I did, because I had great experience at Yassou. The moment you walk in this place, you'll notice the Greek artwork and typical blue and white motif that is allover the restaraunt. There is a cool story along the wall about the history of the restaraunt. Greek music in the background is played throughout and the open kitchen provided a cool interaction between guests and employees.   Onto the food, everything was simply delicious from the Lemon Chicken Pita combo with Greek Fries to the Chicken Souvlaki meal was spot on. They make really good Pita bread and the Tzaziki Sauce was delicious. The Chicken was tender and really seasoned just right. Every bite of my Lemon Chicken had a refreshing taste yet balanced savory flavor. Another item that stood out was the fresh Baklava, very good and made just right. Great amount of sweetness and crunch with a moist texture. I would come back to try out more of the other dishes that they offer in the near future.  Another cool thing about this place was when I went to use the Restroom, I notice that there is a Patio to the left side facing Charleston Blvd was a cool dinning option during days when Vegas has mild weather. The Restroom was clean but I had to share this experience because when I used one of the Restroom. I immediately notice a blue bottle to the corner and couldnt contain myself because it was Windex. All I could think of was, \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding!\" LoL.  2017 Yelp Review #31"}
{"text":"I got the lemon chicken gyro and my husband got a skewer combo and we shared hummus, and everything was delicious and fresh. Everyone was very friendly and the service was quick. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yassou is the best Greek food I've ever had!  We eat here once a week, and crave the Gyro Plate.  The meat is always perfectly cooked and the portions are generous (In fact writing this is making my mouth water.)!  Peter the owner is friendly and welcoming you always feel like you are coming home to eat.  If you are ready for the REAL deal, and haven't tried Yassou, you should, even if there is a line out the door. . . the food is worth the wait!  Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely well priced. Excellent food. Huge portions. Will definitely eat here 2-3X a month going forward. Nice atmosphere on all levels. One of my favorites for this food category. A MUST TRY! !!"}
{"text":"Good food but kitchen and service was disorganized. Gyro sandwiches were delicious. Food 4 star service 2 stars."}
{"text":"The first thing that drew me to Yassou Greek Grill Cafe in 2008 was the building.  I'm a fan of Greek Mythology and had only had Greek food once before, and thought this place with the Greek lettering and broken pillar logo looked quite inviting.  Plus, it was very close to CSN.  My favorite thing to order is the My Big Fat Gyro w/o onions... because, well, who likes onions?  You get a great, heaping helping of lamb, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, and tzatziki sauce.  The Greek fries are also yummy-- I think they are sprinkled with a touch of lemon, and then lots of feta cheese.  The owners are amicable and if you're unsure of what to order, they can make great recommendations.  One of my friends hadn't had lamb before, and they sliced a sample off the rotisserie just for her to try.  They also sell the pita bread they use on their gyros.  I'm so happy that a mom and pop place that actually serves quality food is surviving this economy."}
{"text":"A sandwich fit for a hungry man. That was the only thing running through my head as the waitress placed down my enormous gyro. A combo with American fries and a smoothie comes in at a cool $10.99. It might seem like a lot for fast food, but once you see the gyro it is not outrageous. What is ridiculous is the thought that any single person could finish this colossal pita sandwich alone.   Yassou does give a generous portion of meat, veggies, feta, and tzatziki sauce. I was torn about the meat, because I love the crispiness, but it was also a little dry. With the amount of yogurt based dressing, it is easy to overlook. I am glad that I split this meal with my sister. By the time we finished, we were both out of commission and ready for a nap."}
{"text":"I had seen the building many times but hesitated to stop and try the food until I read the reviews. Lovely place. Clean as a whistle. Great service. Ordered dolmades and Greek salad to go. Fresh and delicious. Enough for lunch the next day. Will be back when I am hungrier to try the other goodies on the menu. How lucky to have found this spot of Greek heaven I can walk to from my place."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I stop by every time I visit Las Vegas.  The food is clean and tastes great! Prices are reasonable so you don't feel like your breaking the bank to eat some good Greek food.  They do make everything as you order so sometimes it may take awhile to get your food.  I'd recommend calling in your order if you're going to take-out anyways."}
{"text":"The service was so horrible. They really ruined my experience and would not want to visit again based on that. The star I guess would be for the cook with the curly gray hair. He seems nice and he was really working. A small piece of advice that I could leave would be for the employees to not go smoke on their break by the people dining outside. Also, there are no pictures up so if someone asks a question about the menu there is no need to be annoyed. One last thing, maybe you should bring everyone's food out at the same time. It's awkward for one person to be eating the the other person doesn't get their plate for another 15 minutes and they're left to eat alone."}
{"text":"Delicious! Took Mom-n-law and was not disappointed! Hubby and I had the huge gyro with rice and salad mom had mixed souvlaki plate. Everything was scrumptious and we were stuffed. I also purchased some dry pasta and a bottle of Mythology Greek olive oil. The oil is so yummy we eat it plain with bread and vinegar!!! I have yet to try the pasta. The only negative I can give is that the Baklava was dry, as other have said. AND the last last negative is...... We live on Sunrise Mountain, we NEED a YASSOU East side ! PLEASE !!!!"}
{"text":"So after a couple years, I decided to give this place a try again. Now I'm hooked. I love the spanakopita plate and lemon chicken soup. The spanakopita is perfect and the dolmas are delicious as well, not too salty like some places. The rice pudding is also a welcomed ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Visited a couple times - mostly for special occasions. Service is decent but not outstanding. The food is what brings us back. Most recently we placed an order for pick up and 1) ordered Greek coffee which we received in a cup less than half full. Not sure if this is the normal serving?? 2) found a hair in our food. Never a pleasant finding."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the yumminess were right on point. However, the service was super slow and the gyros were really lacking on the meat portions. Unfortunately they drop from 5 stars to 3 for me."}
{"text":"The food and the service are equally great here. Definitely a city favorite for me. Family owned place with not a bad item on the menu. I could come here multiple times a week and not get tired of this place. They make everyone feel welcome and are also generous with their portions."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out yesterday. Trying to hit up all the spots I have bookmarked! Anyway, the service was very friendly and I ordered the chicken special for lunch, which was 1 souvlaki skewer, salad, rice, tzatziki and pita. The bf ordered the super lemon chicken pita. My chicken souvlaki was nice and moist, but the salad was drenched in dressing that seemed to be dumped on top of the lettuce and not tossed through. That's a pet peeve of mine...hate getting one bite of dry salad and then the next bite swimming in dressing. Small thing, but kinda ruined the salad for me--the feta on it was yummy though. The tzatziki was ok,  but I've had better. It just tasted a bit processed or something--can't quite put my finger on it.   Overall we both thought the food was good, but it wasn't so spectacular that I can't wait to go back. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely stop in there again for lunch if I was in the area, but I prob won't go out of my way to make a special trip over there."}
{"text":"I guess this would be an okay place to eat if you're leaving the Social Security office down the block and are literally about to die of old age and want to have one last gyros sandwich before you go. But otherwise, meh.  We had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.  The service was friendly and the dining room was bright, spacious and sunny - and the presence of a coffee bar is definitely a plus - but I won't be back."}
{"text":"A Greek man once told me \"This is the only good Greek food in Las Vegas\". I can't say that I've eaten at every Greek place in LV, but I can say that none of the other places I've tried have come close.  Let's start with what to expect, the employees/owners do not seem to be the most service oriented people. Some days they greet you with a hello, other days they convey a sense of \"hurry up and order\". I would like to go on record as stating that I don't believe this is a bad thing. I don't care if the staff doesn't hug and comfort me in times of need, I just want good food which is exactly what Yassou provides.   Their prices are fair given the quality and size of the plates they serve. I usually end up spending 10-15 dollars a meal. The thing that really sets them apart for me is their meats. Cooked perfectly, not dry, not tough, and definitely not bland.   They offer a few of those \"powder from a box\" smoothies, not good at all, but again, what really makes this place worth visiting is the food.   For all you folks who feel limited by \"doors\" and \"walls\", they have tables outdoors which is a plus."}
{"text":"We tried Yassou today, as we've been looking for good gyros since leaving Ohio where a strong Greek community resides. We each ordered the My Big Fat Gyro, and one of us had the salad + rice pilaf for an extra $2.49 while the other got the fries.  The gyros were not bad. They are a mix of beef and lamb and definitely worthy of the Fat name. We did not find them to be better than the gyros we've had in Ohio, but they were still good. I think much of the flavor came from salt, to be honest.  I was surprised by the rice pilaf, which gets high reviews. All I got was rice cooked in chicken broth- basically, yellow-hued rice with nothing more in it. That's not pilaf.  The Greek salad came with no vinaigrette- no salad dressing whatsoever. It was Greek by virtue of the feta and single olive that came with it, I guess.  The American fries were fine- just normal."}
{"text":"I.Just.Love.This.Place. I've been going here for probably 5 years now, if not more. They are consistently good. It's worth the drive from Boulder City (where I live) if that tell you anything!  Produce on salads and gyros is fresh, as is the meat - always well seasoned and cooked well. I've tried several things here, Spanakopita is fresh, truly made by hand (no pre boxed frozen stuff here). Fries are perfectly cooked and it's worth the upgrade to Greek fries. Feta cheese on salads and fries is creamy and tangy. Pitas are soft and delicious, and the gyros are made with generous portions. Sauces are delicious! The Baklava is made daily, SUPER fresh, warm, and the perfect balance of sweetness with the richness of the pastry and nuts. One word of warning, they do not serve pitted olives so watch your teeth!   The staff are attentive and fast. This is a true family owned business and I see the owner and his son working their butts off every time I'm in. The eating areas are kept clean, and there's lots of natural light coming in and a nice outdoor patio area if you like. For what you get, the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mediterranean food, and I have tried a lot of restaurants in Vegas, and California. I was stoked to try this spot after reading the reviews (I even ran a block in the rain to get here!), but it was mediocre at best. My absolute favorite thing in the world (other than maybe koala bears) is koobideh/luleh/lula/ground beef kebab. They didn't have it here!  Major fail.  We ordered a chicken kebab plate, their special fries, and a gyro salad.   The chicken was dry.  For me, that's inexcusable at any med place.  Their whole deal is grilling things.  If you can't grill meat, don't open a restaurant that specializes in grilling meat. Period.   The fries were kind of nice with the spices, and feta bits, but the cut was a bit too thick, and they were overall a bit greasy (even for fries). The salad was pretty good.  I would eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either."}
{"text":"The best Greek fast food I've had in Vegas.  The wife and I ordered the big fat gyro and the super chicken sandwich.  The cashier also let us try a sample of the greek lemon pudding which was excellent so we got an order of that too.  Sandwiches were made to order so you had to wait a bit but its all worth it!"}
{"text":"So decided to check out this place after seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp.  I'm a fan of Greek food, despite not having eaten at all of the Mediterranean restaurants in the valley.  For my initial visit, I decided on the Big Fat Gyro combo which included \"Greek\" fries (garlic and feta) and a fountain soda ($12). Their menu was quite large and encompassed a very nice range of specialties I look forward to checking out on future visits.  I arrived on a Thursday around 11:30 and was greeted by a friendly cashier.  After paying for my order, it magically appeared about 10 minutes later. Opa!!   The gyro was neatly wrapped in foil, and about a third of it was poking out, revealing tasty looking meat topped with tzatziki sauce and feta crumbles.  I was disappointed the meat didn't seem to have very much flavor; typically used to stronger Greek spices and flavors in the gyro meat, this was much more mild.  The pita was decent and definitely not fresh made, as stacks of pre-packaged pitas were displayed 10 high.  Anyway, it was pretty good.  I did notice the owner, Mr Pappas, to be working his tail off preparing nearly every dish himself.  This proud owner only had the assistance of another guy who helped him out when he had a chance.  His red faced determination was evident as he rarely stood still and ensured every dish was prepared as it should be.  Las Vegas needs to continue to support local, hard-working businessmen like Mr Pappas.   Look forward to my next visit when I plan on ordering Souvlaki platter with side of hummus.  Can't wait."}
{"text":"What else can I say except it's one of the best gyros you can get in the valley and at a solid price.  The Big Fat Gyro is just that.  They don't skimp on anything the comes in the gyro.  The lamb is well seasoned.  The tzatziki sauce it's refreshing.  Living in NLV, it's always worth the drive to eat here.  You can get the fries either American ( just fries) or Greek (w/feta cheese & herbs) with the meal."}
{"text":"Wow!  Everything is great!  Lived in Greece for 3 years, and the food here takes me back.  Everything I've tried (saganaki, gyro, pasta, chicken, dolmades, pork) have all been wonderful.  Not to mention the staff--all very friendly.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in vegas. Sometimes their service is slow but it's because they are so busy because the food is so good! Service is always friendly though. Food is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but service is clearly an issue.  Went to eat here with my boyfriend and it's like they forgot about us.  There were only two tables in the restaurant, and people were coming in and placing orders to go.  About three of these to go orders that were made after us were given out before they decided to cook ours.  We arrived with plenty of time to eat but because of this we got our food very close to closing time, and felt like we had to rush to eat.  Not cool.  The food was great, but the service ruined the experience for us.  We're not terribly picky people or anything either."}
{"text":"I walked out rather than wait for what looked like good food.   I was all excited about getting calimari in a mediteranian restaurant.  Never got so far as seeing if it was the real deal with tentacles or the scrappy calimari steak made out of octopus served in California most of the time.   The lunch plate sounded very good...beware. The olives have Pitts...a good way to break a too th...but truly olives are more tasty with Pitts....so the staff and the owner wouldn't wait for me to pull up their 5 dollar coupon and wouldn't honor it on line...only printed out.  They tried to guilt me into why I can't I plan in advance and get my printer to link with my computer....not their business.  I will return with a caseload of tourists and my service puppy and see what they have to say...rude people...they refused another coupon for a mature couple who didn't show the coupon assertively before the order was rung up....thumbs down here...I walked out....no stevia...no napkins....no wait staff to take your orders.   I get that the owner is Greek...this is a mediteranian restaurant...they have hummus but no tabouli or Tahini...REALLY.....go to chick pea or sababa in summerlin....imho...ShadowZRanch"}
{"text":"Perfect for me.  Excellent place for a 1st date or quick, tasty & healthy meal.  Just went 1st time here yesterday.  It was freaking fantastic!  Seems like the owner knows everyone, because he didn't recognize me and started to help me make some decisions.  He then offered me a sample of some rice & greens, which appeared simple to the eye, but surprisingly delicious, light & fresh.  The portions are very generous and everything I had (platter of stuff) was simply perfect.  The owner truly cares about his quality of food and gave top notch service.  Other reviewers complain about the service, I assume the owner wasn't around at those times."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I always order the Souvlaki combo. The meats are perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food was really good. I had the Souvlaki beef/chicken plate and my bf had the Moussaka plate. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. The salad and rice are made well too. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the fact that the moussaka was really soggy. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly. They're priced well too. We plan on going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in town. HANDS DOWN.   I randomly walked in about a year ago to see what it was about. i tried a specialty plate. ehhh. it was alright, but i noticed everyone around me had a gyro. and so i decided that i was going to come here again and try to gyro.  oh man was that a good idea!! i crave gyros from here all the time.  i tried a gyro someplace else, and it wasn't very good.  thats when i truly appreciated how good this small deli-like restaurant was. i don't like the yogurt stuff on it, so i always ask for them to put it on the side. then i have the option of taking a couple bites with it instead of the whole thing.   again, this is a locally owned restaurant. so go support them!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Been here well over 20 times, great food and great service.   The mousaka is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Seriously good. You will not be disappointed! I had the super lemon chicken gyro with Greek fries!! Mmmmmmmm!!!!! Wish this place was where I lived!"}
{"text":"I walked in just now after they had closed at 5:00, and although the kitchen was put away, the owners nephew offered to serve me the things that he could still make up. :) I thought that was such a nice gesture instead of turning away a first-time visitor, and hungry one at that! :) I had the Greek Salad and Rice Pilaf, and the Hummus, and all of it was awesome! Yum! I'm a new fan of this place because of everything they did. Wish more businesses were like them. Everyone come here and try these guys. Family owned, let's support them! :)"}
{"text":"Very excellent Greek food. I had the Gyros plate and had enough left to take home. Great tasting with real Lamb shaved off of rotisereie , not the brown lunchmeat type. Girlfriend had the Big Gyro sandwhich. Large and filling !! I Tsadziki was great too. Recommended !!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I go here whenever I visit my sister who lives in LV. I love the greek fries!! Actually, everything I had was great. They don't always have smoothies but with so many other great options, who cares!! Best Greek Food in LV!! Yassou even came out to say hello, he has awesome hair!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing whole family visited for the first time today. Tried several different plates and sandwiches everything was amazing. Also highly suggest a smoothie"}
{"text":"Es sin duda la comida griega más rica el lugar muy limpio y el servicio excelente se los recomiendo no se arrepentirán"}
{"text":"I've been coming to yassous for 9 years and I'd say they've stayed consistent throughout all these years. I tend to always order the same things bc I'm a creature of habit and it's just really tasty.  They are family run with the dad cooking in the back most of the time and his son running the front. I get the avgolemo (lemon rice soup) mmmmmm you must try it! Also the big fats are insanely good and you can't forget dessert with there scrumptious baklava. I highly recommend and will continue to come here as often as I can. Great customer service."}
{"text":"What can I say, best gyros!!! Got to get a big fat gyro with those feta fries!!! I have tried many gyros around town and no one can compare. I don't know what about it makes it different?!?! I've tried adding some of the things on this gyro to other gyros at other places and it still doesn't compare. Super friendly service-I feel like they know me here ha ha. Love love love! If you like gyros--try it!!"}
{"text":"If I could give Yassou's 10 stars I would do it in a heartbeat.  Absolutely THE BEST gyro (big fat) in the valley.  We have tried them all and if you want the best for Greek food then this is it.  Prices are very reasonable, portions are huge.  The owner works behind the line and he works hard - yet always finds a minute to look up and wave or say hi, especially when he sees the hubby's Yankees hat!  Awesome food, friendly staff, clean restaurant, great prices, you can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Gr8 Greek fast food w/quality ingredients and a big menu.  Casual atmosphere w/good service.  Hype is true here. Vegetarian and carnivore selections are delicious. Generous servings and good service. Recommend the Greek Plates and desserts. Yummy pita and gyros."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I always passed this cute little Greek restaurant on my way to my friends house until one day I decided to give it a try. Thank goodness I did the food was amazing you can just taste the  freshness and authenticity but also the passion the chef has for his cooking the minute I walked in I was greeted not only by the cashier but the chef came out to say hello as well I felt very welcomed and most definitely content with my food. You have the option of taking you food to go, eat inside the restaurant, or eat out in their patio which is what I did. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for something to eat when I ventured beyond the strip for work and found this great Greek place!  Plenty of seating!  Ordered the Greek Salad with Herb Chicken and while there wasn't much chicken, the vinaigrette was perfect. Feta cheese on point. Personally, I love cherry tomatoes on my salads but that might be just me."}
{"text":"I had the big fat gyro...it was okay, but the main issue I had was that it was so salty.  My boyfriend had one of the plates, and he did not like the excess salt content either.   We were drinking water hours afterwards.  The place I think needs a little TLC.  Pictures do not depict what it is really like.  The bathroom was really dirty, a real turn off.   I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food,  prepared by excellent staff, my husband and I enjoyed it!, we'll definitely return"}
{"text":"We had Yassou's delieverd to our office and it was my first time having Yassou. I was enjoyed my meal very much, the traditional gyro was so flavorful and the chicken kabobs were easily eaten on the stick, i wasnt a fan of the baklava the ratio of filo and filling wasnt even there was to much filo and not enough filling but other than that the meal was fantastic"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I ate at in Vegas, and, 9 years later, it continues to be one on my favorites! The gyro, souvlaki, and spanakopita are all absolutely delicious!   My parents come from Ohio every year for Christmas, and we eat here at least twice because my mom loves it.   Great, family run business. If you're looking for amazing, affordable Greek food, this is the place."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! Amazing gyros!!! Also love the salads here too!! So tasty and good family owned place! The gyro meat is the real deal here!! And the dessert is so good!! Baklava is so good and also the rice pudding!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is pretty much a brand new restaurant. So, maybe they're working The Kinks out. I ordered the filet Kabob. The menu says filet mignon. Yeah, I don't think so. I'll try again and update my review later. The stuffed grape leaves were not bad. The  humas was pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best Greek food in Las Vegas! I enjoy the Greek Salad with Gyro meat, my wife really likes the chicken skewers with rice. Friendly staff always happy and willing to help. It gets really busy around lunch time so arrive early. Great for catering as well."}
{"text":"Wow! Thanks LVYELP for all the great reviews! I love trying new places! Today I made my way to Yassou for the first time with one of my besties. We ordered 3 appetizers and a main entree and shared everything. $30 for 2 people for lunch is reasonable! Everything we had was delicious! I'm a fan of their pita bread and hummus! I found my new favorite greek spot for lunch in the city! I will come back! My gf and I both agreed YGGC rocks! Love it! If you're in the area or visiting the city and looking for greek food... come here! no regrets! great customer service, no problem with seating (indoor/outdoor) or parking, affordable! -Miss Yelp 2012"}
{"text":"Best greek food hands down baby.  Owners 1 of a kind people.  Work their asses off.  Great guys.  Came to my wifes work for one of their families bdays and boy they spread the love tipping everyone and treating the staff like gold.  1 thing i will say is the portion of saginaki seems small but taste good.  Best gyro ever."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Attentive staff! The gyro was delicious and everything tasted fresh. The cashier was good and attentive and the staff is friendly. Best Greek food I've had in a while! Also the baklava is delicious and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is lacking. Girl behind counter all though super nice is pushing retarded. You tell her one thing she does another. I watched it with my own eyes in the 30 minutes I sat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. In from out of town but would come back regularly if we could.   We ordered the big fat gyro. All the ingredients were fresh and perfectly portioned. The meat wasn't greasy or dry. We also had the Greek fries which tasted like heaven. Definitely recommend those for a side. My husband really enjoyed the baklava for dessert - which was a big piece, enough to share.   The inside is small but clean and charming.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for five years now and every meal is great. I highly recommend this restaurant. They are fast, friendly and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop joint for the Mediterranean food.  The chicken kabobs were really good, and the Greek salad was okay. I think I had the lemon herb chicken or something like that. Everyone seemed to love their dish. Prices are quite modest as well. I'd come back since the workers are super sweet and they have great service."}
{"text":"I returned to the \"Yassou\" grill, to see if they had returned to their original recipe for the lemon based salad dressing, certainly a house speciality and worth the trip across town,  sorry to report they have not, and serve only the oily inferior blend, sad.  (sure wish they would rethink the dressing change,   old dressing a 10+, new version a 2-"}
{"text":"I came here 4 years ago, thought the gryo was too salty and otherwise average, and never returned.   Came back with a friend on a super busy lunch time on Friday. The hummus was good and seems house-made. They didn't have the red caviar for another dip on the menu I wanted to try. My friend like her Greek Salad.   I would give it 1 star for the dolmades if not for the above. Why is there meat in it?? The grape leaves were hard, old, and stringy/veiny. The dip that came with it was lemony-sour but also oily in a way that its yellow tallowed appearance reminded me of lard. And the texture was similar.   I'll stick with Meraki Grill."}
{"text":"Service, Sweet Sweet Excellent Customer service is what takes this local-owned and family-run restaurant over the top.   They try their darndest to remember your first name and treat you as if you had been going to their restaurant for years even if you are a newbie.  I hope they will be around whenever I make my yearly trip back to LV"}
{"text":"This wasn't too bad.  I had the lamb gyro.  Needs a little more flavor some where and thats where the sauce comes in.  I would come back for seconds and try something different."}
{"text":"Got a gyro plate and loved it. Fantastic service, delicious food, convenient location. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent salmon plate. Delicious lemon sauce on the salmon kept it moist and tasty. Yassou maintains consistent quality and has a good variety of menu selections. Family owned and operated. Pleasant staff. Everything I've eaten here has been good quality."}
{"text":"Great food prepared by Greeks for great prices! What more can you ask for. The moussaka was amazing! Thanks Christian!"}
{"text":"The Best Greek Food in Vegas....  A Big Fat Gyro is the bomb.   The chicken plate is the perfect change of pace if you don't want a gyro.   They cater too.  Easy and simple.   I eat here 3 times a week.  I stopped eating meet for almost 300 days, but the thought of missing out on not being able to have a gyro brought me back to being a meat eater.   They have delicious spanakopita too..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with a colleague to grab a bite to eat. First of all, their customer service is TOP NOTCH! As soon as we walked in, the guy behind the register greeted us and chatted with my friend (he's a regular there). He was very polite and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything and anything I could have wanted. He was like that with every person who walked in. KUDOS! It seemed like most of the people who came in were regulars, or they treated them that way. I can't say enough nice things about how awesome the service was. Now to the food. I had a Big Fat Gyro Sandwich that was yummy. My only complaint was that it needed more tahini sauce (again, you can never have too much!) but I stole some from my dining partner. It was a great, light meal. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Attempting to eat a little better than usual, I had my eye on a salad for lunch. I have wandered by this restaurant on many occasions and finally decided to give them a shot.   They were packed for lunch, so I put in my order and found a seat to sit and wait. It took a good amount of time since there were a number of orders ahead of me, but once it was ready I was so excited to dig right in to my lemon chicken and gyro Greek salad.   There was tons of meat, feta, onions and kalamata olives to accompany the lettuce. I didn't even feel the need to pour any dressing over it, since it was packed with so many delicious toppings. The salad really hit the spot the well-cooked gyro and chicken made my day, it was so delicious.   I plan on making this a regular on my lunchtime rotation and I look forward to trying many more menu items in the future. I might call my order in ahead of time to save time."}
{"text":"Love the food. Usually service is great too   Today service was terrible- the cashier, which is what dropped the rating down. He argued with another person who said her order was incorrect then went and tossed it back with the rest of the food with a visible attitude about it. Was t very pleasant when our order was taken. Owner wasn't in as he usually is- must have a big impact"}
{"text":"Service/Owners are always friendly and smiling.  Hands on ownership with father and son team that take pride in their work.  Food is always excellent.  Most people love their chicken kabobs the bust but many other great things on the menu.  I usually order the steak and gyro combo plate.  Their calamari is absolutely incredible when they have it but they have been unable to get a supplier to get them the quality of calamari they want/used to get so they haven't been serving it anymore.  Their greek pizza is also terrific.  Hard to find places where they make the food from scratch after you order and is so fresh and tasty and inexpensive.  You order in a line and they bring it out to you but you don't have waitresses so a bargain and aren't required to tip.  Consistently good place that is a once a week place for me.  Don't forge to try the Lemon Soup!"}
{"text":"Grest food. Phone in order ready when we arrived.  Christian the owner is very har woeking and friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek restaurant in Vegas. The gyro has been seasoned to perfection and the portions are generous."}
