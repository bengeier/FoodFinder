{"text":"Bought a massive amount of pulled pork here for a family event and everyone loved it.  Great friendly service.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and got the 2 Polish Boy for $8 special. Pretty good. Sauce is slightly sweet and really good. The sausage was cooked well with a good snap to it and had a smoky flavor to it. If you are in the hood give it a shot."}

{"text":"Hands down the best polish boy sandwich in Cleveland. The dog is spicy with a good snap. Topped with shredded BBQ pork, home made cole slaw, and an order of fries. The sandwich is rolled up tightly in foil and handed over by the smiling counter person who issues a challenge to eat the sandwich and not implode in the process. I would drive across town any day or night to take them up on the challenge. But I have yet to be able to finish that sandwich in one sitting. They are a longtime fixture in Cleveland and this little neighborhood restaurant is five star for polish boys sandwiches."}

{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but I love the way they cook chicken, and I love the sauce and fries. THEY ARE A bit pricey but they are really good. THEY ARE A BIT SLOW but still really good. I usually call in my order, wait the allotted time and go."}
