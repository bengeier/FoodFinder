{"text":"Awesome neighborhood place with a great family at the helm. Massive burritos with fresh ingredients. Recommend the pork and chicken combo; wife loves the Asada box with shrimp and the boy will eat chicken tacos all day. Whatever you do ADD GUACAMOLE!"}
{"text":"Just moved to St. Clair West recently and I've been looking for quality places with reasonable prices to pick up food on a regular basis. Found this hidden gem not too far from my place. All the ingredients are very fresh and the customer experience is excellent! Big fan of the steak and chicken."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying that I am mexican. And my taste buds are not even close to being gringofied. 

I love this place! I probably wouldn't of gone except it's so incredibly close to home. I don't frequent mexican joints because I am always disappointed. But not at Asada! 

I have been there a few times, and have tried quite a bit of the menu. Everything has been great. My favorites are the amazing home cooked style pozole (best hangover cure EVER!) and the cochinita pibil. 

The salsa bar is the best in town (after my own, of course)! The only thing that's missing is pepinos & rábanos & cebollitas.... 

Can't wait to go back!

Oh, I almost forgot to mention, the staff is the best staff I have ever encountered in TO! Friendly, great attitude, and always looking to make your experience even better! Great job, guys! You make the neighbors and the mexicans proud!"}
{"text":"A very casual Tex Mex type of restaurant, more like a take out but there is seating inside and out.  The portions are sizable,  but the food lacks the subtle flavours of  authentic Mexican food.  I usually love the red Mexican drink called Jamaica (made from dried Hibiscus leaves) but theirs was watery yet very red!
Two of us spent well  over $35.00 for only tacos, water and a Jamaica.  On the pricey side so not good value.  We will keep trying other Mexican restaurants until I find the perfect combination of great flavours, fresh food not prepared hours in advance,  fair portions and good value."}
{"text":"Really good food, good service. Finally a taco place that is way way better than Chipotle"}
{"text":"Excellent service, knowledgeable staff & amazing food! 

Massive portions of the freshest toppings you can find. Everything is made in-house and it shows in the food & taste quality. The menu is completely affordable and worth every cent!  

The staff was really great. In fact, they delivered some sweet cinnamon treats to our table outside! It was a really kind gesture that I will assume came from an unusually long wait time for our food. 

If you're in the area, be sure to check this place out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I think this is as fresh as food can get.
If you are up for a great Mexican experience, this place is the best package. Friendly, and well served... and when you take your first bite at it, don't forget to breathe. I had a fish burrito with the works baja style."}
{"text":"I heard that Asada was amazing before I went, and was dying to try it. But I had no idea that it would surpass my expectations. The tortilla shell was the best I have ever had; it was so soft and fresh. The filling was even better. I am vegan, and I didn't feel that my filling was lacking in substance in any way. All of the flavours from the ingredients - the beans, the onions, the guacamole, and the pico de gallo - were all perfectly distinguishable and came together in a perfect harmony. I particularly loved the cilantro. 

All of the staff was also really nice. 

I will DEFINITELY be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a quick bite and can't wait to return. We had the 3 tacos and the guacamole and chips. Love the free salsa bar!"}
{"text":"The food is alright but my biggest problem with this place is that it's horribly overpriced. I ordered baja fish tacos and a baja fish burrito and water and the total came up to $40! At burrito boys, 2 fish burritos and water would come up to $23. I was really shocked how expensive my meal ended up being and the fish wasn't even good quality and had a fishy taste to it. The tacos were also small. Really thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito. Was delicious and filling. Lots of toppings to choose from and all look good and fresh. 
I was hoping to get a slightly bigger burrito for the price and that's why I gave it 4 stars only."}
{"text":"The food and service are so good, I don't know where to begin, My partner and I headed out on a dark, stormy night to see if the food would cheer us up and WOW! Best Mexican homestyle food I've eaten in Toronto! And, having spent part of my life in California, I have been lucky enough to have good, homestyle Mexican food before.

He had a pulled pork burrito and I had three veggie tacos in soft corn tortillas. The burrito was perfect -- all of the ingredients were fresh and flavourful. The pulled pork was especially wonderful with a slightly cinnamon-y taste. The tacos were also exceptional -- four kinds of beans to choose from: pinto cooked and refried, black beans cooked and refried. All of the toppings were amazing -- guacamole, fried onions and jalapeños, picked onions especially good. It was, however, the homemade tortillas that were the star of the show -- heavenly! The apple soda and the freshly brewed iced tea were also excellent. Sweet nachos a nice light end to our meal.

We don't eat any processed food, and so one of our great challenges is finding restaurant food that meets our high standards. Asada's food sails over that high bar: it is refreshing to find restaurant food full of complex tastes (and not overly full of sugar and salt).

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"One star for the counter staff who were at least friendly. And although cheerful, this place was far from cheap, considering the overall experience. Almost $38 for 2 orders of (3) tacos and a couple of iced teas. Strike one - they were out of guacamole (at the dinner hour). Strike two - no one had their smart serve, so we couldn't order beer. Strike three - the iced tea we ordered as an alternate was past its sell-by date (luckily there was fresh stuff behind it in the fridge). Oh heck, they're already out but let's add a fourth strike - the food was beyond bland, which was the most disappointing thing of all. Thankfully there are other choices in the neighbourhood for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing! The BEST FAST FOOD MEXICAN EVER! The vegetarian options are great!
The deep fried avocado- too good to miss!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food! Grilled pork, chicken and steak are all fantastic. Rice in my burrito is very delicious, and so is the sauce. The taste is authentic and special. The service is also great! We love the place."}
{"text":"this place is really good!!!!! awesome to have it in the neighborhood.

really friendly service. .. and the tacos  awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down both the absolute best and absolute worst place in the neighbourhood.

It takes a huge amount of patience to get a meal at this place.

Expect to wait no less then twenty minutes to get your food. Minimum.

Most of your time will be spent standing around, while everyone that works there does seemingly nothing. Your food will then be ready to assemble, and you will discover that all of the lettuce, and tomato is empty (no one filled this during your twenty minute wait).

No one will make eye contact with you because I think they know how terrible they are

THAT BEING SAID, if you can muster up the patience, the food here is so goddamn good that it is worth the wait and the extreme over pricing.

I'm so torn about this place. Every time I go I say i'm never coming back, only to find myself back there a week later.

It seems to be getting worse though, so who's to say how much longer it will be worth the long, frustrating wait."}
{"text":"We had a great experience with Asada catering a party at our house. Austin and Klaudia were very easy to work with, friendly and helpful. They organized a great spread of make-your-own tacos that satisfied both our vegan and meat-loving friends. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly staff. Absolutely worth a trip if you're in the area.

I've been quite a few times and they have been consistently delicious. I always get the corn tacos and promise myself that i'll save the last one for a snack later on, but they're just too tasty and I end up pigging out on all three. 

The meats are so well seasoned I usually don't even bother with the guac or the fried onions but if you do decide to splurge on them, you won't be disappointed! (Be prepared to be unconscious for a few hours afterwards... that's a lot of food!)"}
{"text":"Eaten here at least 20 times since moving my office just down the street. Food is consistently fresh and delicious, and the staff and owner are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. A great asset to the St Clair West community!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, super friendly service. I've been twice in the past week. Have had their tacos and their box (think burrito bowl) and both were hot, fresh and full of flavour. Loads of toppings to choose from. A simple menu yet with lots of variety by the time you put it all together. My new favourite Mexican takeaway place."}
{"text":"Great food and experience! Staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful :)

I ordered the taco shells (you get 3) and was pleasantly surprised they would allow me to customize each of them! So I tried the steak, pulled pork and marinated pork. The marinated pork was fantastic, and the steak was also quite good. There was nothing wrong with the pulled pork but it didn't work well in a taco for me. All of the toppings and ingredients were very fresh and tasty. The Baja sauce is also delish and It looks like they make everything in house!!

Very happy with this neat little find on St. Clair, and will definitely drop by again for some quality fast food."}
{"text":"Had the 3 soft tacos chicken, steak and fish, everything tasted cold and it was runny. I was a little disappointed. Very friendly staff and good vibe."}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork and the service! Food is really fresh and I would go every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Asada is awesome! Have eaten here many times and it is always good. Great place to go when you want fast, quality, fresh food.

The owner and staff really care and make sure you enjoy your meal. 

Try the vegetarian tacos. Super filling with beans, grilled onions, jalapeños and guacamole."}
{"text":"Definitely OVERPRICED!! If the tacos where the regular 6 inch size that would make it a little better but those tiny tacos are worth $1 in Los Angles, California. The actual food here is not even that great. The Baja fish taco is so small that it looked like a joke. Only came here because Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos was closed :("}
{"text":"Get the 3 taco option so you can try different combinations.  t's namesake Asada beef tacos are awesome. Also really liked the melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork as well as the chorizo sausage. The soft shell corn tortillas are super fresh. Also loved the pickled onions and cabbage for their respective tang and crunch.

My only \"criticism\" is that there are too many options. It would be nice to have recommendations of which toppings go well with the various proteins. It would probably speed up the line as well.

Service is really friendly and helpful. Highly recommended for grown up and kids!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. It's not a table service place: it's more of a high end mall food court experience. You choose between a burrito, taco or sandwich and pick your fillings from a steam table. I had the steak and it  was quite tasty. For a quick 'run in, eat and leave' experience this is hard to beat"}
{"text":"Quite easily the best burrito in the city. HUGE portion size and exquisite flavors. The veggie burrito with guac is unreal. Everything is done with care and love and it is reflected in the quality of the food. The shrimp tacos and fish tacos are also really good. Fresh and flavorful though not as filling. 

Get your burrito fully loaded and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in an order, they won't make it till you show up. That's the third time this has happened. The manager was dismissive and didn't care that the service was bad. On the phone I gave my order then had to reorder once i got there. The burrito wasn't even worth the wait. I will now be driving the 10 minutes to Burrito Boy. Plus, the owner shouldn't let his staff work with their shirts inside out. Show a little pride people."}
{"text":"Went over the weekend and loved the authenticity of  the food. Great to experience awesome Mexican food in a city that hosts too many Tex-Mex eatery's claiming to be authentic Mexican. The cochinita pibil aka Mexican pulled pork, and the carne asada and chorizo are the signature flavors that screamed Mexico. It's new it's fresh and it's local. What a great combination to have in Toronto for a market that's been lacking in authenticity. I read the review making reference to it not measuring up to Chipotle an American fast food concept eatery backed by McDonalds in 2006..need I say more? Let's keep supporting Canadian small businesses. The food speaks for itself and the business model is one I'm sure will continue to be its foundation for success putting its client experience alongside its uncompromising great taste above all else. Without a doubt it's a restaurant I would recommend to anyone asking for the real taste of Mexico with no need to dig deep into your wallet. Well priced and amazing servings. Satisfaction guaranteed. Looking forward to the summer when the lttle patio will yield some outdoor access for people watching in an active hustling local neighborhood that is in an incredibly multicultural part of the city."}
{"text":"Tried on Sunday
Tried the 3 tacos, one of chicken, steak and pork. All three were very tasty, with my fave being the pork. The tortilla's had a great fresh corn flavor, and everything was crisp and fresh. 
Spoke breifly to the owner who is taking real pride in the place. All the staff were incredibly friendly.
Next time i will have to try the baja fish tacos.
Great to have a new fast, slow food place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good, a bit pricey. They have gluten free tacos, but they heat them on the same grill as the flour ones. It's totally understandable if theyre not catering to sever sensitivity, but I wish they would have asked me about whether it was ok to put then on thr same grill. I would have said I'll eat them unheated.

Otherwise, it's nice enough. Clean. Honestly not much else going on here above Chipotle. They have beer, etc., but it's not a place I would go for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer said not even close to Chipotle...I agree - there is no comparison - Asada's got it bang on - or should I say Burrito on!  Wow - best tasting Burrito in Toronto...by leaps and bounds over Chipotle, Mucho, Quesada...and even a leg up on  Burrito Boyz/Banditos...  

For a Vegan too, this place was A1 - 2 kinds of refried beans AND 2 kinds of regular beans...no need to ask for Vegan Guac - their's is always Vegan - Grilled veggies including Zucchini, Mushrooms, Peppers....help yourself sauces, need I say more?

Their Vegan Mexican Soup was also 10/10 - deliciously homemade. Looks like we found our new Burrito Spot...maybe a little more expensive than Burrito Boyz/Banditos - but definitely better value because the quality, freshness, and selection of ingredients - It's worth the extra buck or two.  Highly Recommended - and they are even looking at adding Vegan Cheese...can't wait!

Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I live nearby. This place is amazing for quick and great quality food, decent prices but BIG portions. I had to save half my burrito for later. I also really like the service, everyone was super kind and made great suggestions. I especially liked their custom sauces. Delicious."}
{"text":"food taste was ok, the meats could use a bit more flavor to stand out in the burritos

all the ingridients were really fresh specially the guacamole.
meats are more a 3/5 rating since the flavor of it gets a little lost in the burrito maybe tacos are better.also since the burrito is big a think they could have put a little more meat specially for the chorizo since its just ground pork its not to expensive and they could afford just a tad more meat for the burrito size and the price you are paying.

i didnt really like the cochinita pibil it seem like it had cinnamon and which gave it a different taste that what im used to eating when in yucatan.

toppings were nice but nothing to special  burrito tasted good and was pretty big

price wise it was really expensive even if the burrito was really big

guac $2.25? and grill onions and jalapenos are $2 additional(way to expensive 4-5$ in extras) to the burrito so a fully loaded burrito is about $15.00 + drinks i would prefer a bit smaller burrito with a price range of around $10

service was really nice the owner was eating lunch when i left but still took the time to thank me for coming and wished me a good day which was nice

service 5/5
Atmosphere 4/5
food 3.5/5
price 3/5"}
{"text":"Friendly service, staff obviously takes pride in their food.  Everyone there seemed to have intimate knowledge of how everything was made.  Although the set up is like a fast food, take out, the food quality is dine in.  Ingredients is fresh and dishes made to order.  The lack of salt in their seasoning was noticeable.  I mention this as a positive as we did not find the food lacking in flavour at all.  In fact the lack of salt allowed the ingredients to stand on their own."}
{"text":"ate there for lunch today. WOW, burrito was awesome, ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Staff that works there were friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend. Looking forward to their new location in Yonge and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say the quality has gone down since my last visit. We are regulars and were really disappointed that the fish taco I had the piece of fish was so tiny it was half the length of the tortilla and only about 1.5 cms wide. They were out of crispy tortillas and out of steak (was around 6pm), and the pico de gallo was mushy and didn't seem fresh. The shredded cabbage contained giant hunks from the heart of the cabbage and the onion and cilantro mix the onions weren't really chopped they were huge pieces of onion with browning cilantro.

ETA: went back and they were out of both steak and chicken, and they offered the people in front of us onions and jalapeños without informing them there was a charge which seemed pretty annoying to the people who'd agreed to them when offered. Also, the guac is super bland. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Love this place, lots of options, always delicious. Although today we went and they were out of several items. Including refried beans and guac....A Mexican place with no refried beans or guac. And they said it would take 30 minutes to make more guac?? Haha wow."}
{"text":"I went to this local, family-owned restaurant last week and ordered the Asada box with Carne Asada (steak), black beans, sour cream, grilled onions and jalapeno plus nachos and guacamole.  

The steak was cooked well (other places tend to over cook and dry it out), and went very well with the black beans and sour cream.  The grilled onions and jalapenos had a definite kick to them which I thoroughly enjoyed, eating them on their own.  And the guacomole was FRESH!  Went super well with the  nachos.  You won't get that in the chains.  

Another differentiator from the chains is that Asada has Coca Cola from Mexico which is made with sugar cane instead of the crappy corn syrup fructose.  There is a notable difference in taste.  Took me back to my childhood.

My boyfriend ordered the 3 tacos with Chorizos and mexican rice, plus grilled onions and jalapeno, guacomole and nachos.  He inhaled the tacos and raved over the Chorizos, which like all the meats served in the restaurant are hormone free.  

The owner of the restaurant has a nice word to say to everyone who comes in and the staff, composed of family members and regular staff, is efficient, knowledgeable and very friendly. 

Another attractive thing about this place is the decor.  The live wood bar along the wall, the tables, the lighting and the wonderful wall decorations like the pop bottles lined up against the wall and the intricately designed wood Aztec calendar all combine to give the restaurant both a uniquely Mexican flavour along with a local, friendly neighbourhood feel.  

This place is the real deal.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited this little Mexican restaurant yesterday evening. Their hours for weekday have actually changed for the winter. They close at 9pm and luckily we got there for 8:30pm just before they closed.

It was my first time here. I love all tacos, so when I heard of this place I had to try it. I shared 6 tacos between 2 people. We has 3 grilled shrimp/fish tacos for $13.95 and 3 steak/chicken tacos for $9.95. The grilled shrimp tacos were the best. The price is not bad for 3 tacos in comparison to other locations that easily charge $5 to $6 per taco. The only down fall is the tacos were a little small, well the tortilla at least. We loaded our tacos with everything. I liked that you could choose your toppings for the taco, but not everything actually fit on the taco because the tortilla was so small. The only thing I did not like is they charge $2.75 to put guacamole on the 3 tacos. That up charge is way too much considering how small the tacos were, so we did not get it. 

We also got a order of guacamole and chips. It was decent. The chips were not as fresh/flavorful as other places I've been to. The cost for that was $5.95 it's big for the cost.

I would recommend coming here because the food is decent and reasonably proced (minus the guacamole on the tacos, but because I drove from Markham... and the proximity of this location is so much closer to other Taco places.... I would suggest maybe another taco place like Wilber or La Carnita. 

Parking on the street was also free after 8 pm fyi"}
{"text":"I really appreciate that this is a family run business, and they try really hard to keep their customers happy.  From the friendly girls preparing the food in front of you, to the owner asking to see that everything was to your liking.  This is a place to come back to over and over.

The food is really good, fresh, and the portion sizes are more than adequate (especially the giant burritos).

This place is licensed an serves both beer and wine, which is a great idea for semi-fast food.  And a beer always goes great with a taco!

The place is spotlessly clean, and has a nice sized outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"My flight got canceled home to Houston,  TX.  This place reminded me of home with food. Service was phenomenal, very bouncy and helpful!"}
{"text":"Tasty tasty! 
I had the pork pibil burrito and it was spicy tangy and super fresh!
The service was wonderful, very friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Asada is hands down the BEST Mexican joint in the city! Every time I go to Asada I leave SO full and satisfied. Guac is some of the freshest I've had and the flavours vary from spicy to mild! I love love love Asada, I'm so confused by the negative reviews! This place is my #1 go-to for their burritos, burrito bowls, guac and chips etc. The service is also one of the reasons I came into Asada in the first place over a year ago! Guac may be extra-but it's extra every where! After trying Asada you will never go back to Chipotle again (I haven't)"}
{"text":"We've been fans since this location opened and have tried everything on the menu.

The food is still good and fresh if your meat selection hasn't been dried up and hardened from sitting in the warmup tray.   

That said, things are slipping, and quickly--particularly so since the opening of the Yonge and Eglinton location.   Delighted for your success, but keep up or give up.

Pickled jalapeños as condiments haven't been available for over a year despite demand.     (It is possible, however, to get grilled jalapeños and onions as add-on toppings for an extra $2.)   

The cilantro and onion condiment topping is consistently full of sand, so you get grit crunch in almost every bite.    Wash your cilantro properly, damn.   

This week we stopped in for a takeout order and found that there was no lettuce available.   Then at the condiment counter, there were no takeout containers for salsa or limes.

That's it.    We are now done."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to this place was better than the previous one.  The people at the counter were much more attentive and this time the meat fillings of the tacos were piping hot (and super tasty and fresh).  However, the toppings and salsa that I asked them to put on my tacos were almost ice cold.  If they could fix these little hiccups and inconsistencies, I would frequent this place even more."}
{"text":"Amazing staff - so friendly and helpful. The food is very fresh and tasty, and I love the burritos. I go frequently."}
{"text":"The waitresses were amazingly friendly on the two occasions I've been here. The first time I was here I was indecisive so the waitress told me about the fried avocado on their \"secret menu\". It's ridiculously good! Also they have an open salsa bar, which is delicious as there were at least 8 varieties of garnishes and salsa.

Did I mention their portions were enormous?"}
{"text":"I had my hopes up for this place with its nice facility. However when it came to the food and Pricing I could not be more disappointed. Almost all desirable toppings cost extra, charging extra for guac is fine but onions lol common. The lettuce in my burrito was old and had black spots. Lastly, the staff have an unfriendly attitude. I wouldn't go back here if the food was free"}
{"text":"There was a point in time that I would come here weekly... but sadly the quality has dipped and the prices have gone up A LOT. It's a shame!

In the span of ~3 years, all their prices have gone through the roof. From $7.95 to $10.95 for a burrito/taco/bowl. Horchatas (on the rare occasion they have them) are $4.75 if I recall correctly, which is absolutely mind boggling. It's all across the menu. 

They haven't had Mexican Coke in ages, and there's often something missing -- once they were out of cheese, another time they were out of guacamole (how a Mexican place could ever run out of cheese or guac is beyond me). The taco bar is sometimes open and sometimes not. 

It's obvious they have less traffic so sometimes you'll get meat that has been sitting around and dry."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!

But I thought the good was mediocre at best and overpriced. I had one each of chorizo, carne asada and al pastor each--the carne asada was the tastiest but still lacking something.

I would go back just cause the service was awesome."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED! My wife and I got one pastor burrito \"due to the fact they did not have any ASADA or chicken\" 3 Baja fish tacos, chips and guacamole, and a drink for $33. This wouldn't be so bad if the food didn't SUCK!! There is nothing authentic about this food - Chipotle is so much better, if youre going for that fake Mexican food. We are never going back! After we were done eating here, we went across the street to a much better Hispanic food place."}
{"text":"Asada is amazing because they offer unique ingredients and sauces that you can add to your burritos. They have a great beer selection with a lot of imported choices from Mexico. I also appreciate how the owner interacts with all the customers."}
{"text":"We tried this place out from a Buytopia food coupon and were extremely happy we did! On food, service and price they score 4.5! 
The menu is small but you don't need much when ordering burritos and tacos- the staples were there. We ordered a baja fish burrito and three tacos. Both were extremely satisfying and the servers are not shy of the toppings.
All of the toppings including their four fresh salsas were freshly prepared and delicious. The prices were very affordable too; each dish was $9!
We would definitely visit again. Go try it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food here is great! It is always fresh and makes for a great lunch that is also very affordable. Tons of great options to put in your burrito, quesadilla or taco. The staff are incredibly friendly. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place makes great tacos. I especially like the salad bar where you can get fresh jalapeños which is similar to a lot of places in California"}
{"text":"Amazing! Similar concept to Burrito Boyz, Chipotle but much more authentic tasting. The toppings are all extremely fresh and they don't skimp on the toppings. 

I had the Asada Box with chicken which is basically a burrito without the shell. They had 4 kinds of beans - pinto and black in both whole and refried style. Being a bean lover, I was super stoked about being able to get all four in my bowl. The chicken was char-grilled to perfection. Other passion points include the pickled onions and shredded cabbage. The self-serve salsa bar was a unique offering that made the burrito even tastier. 

The prices are slightly higher than at other comparable spots ($10+tax for a standard burrito), but the quality and variety of ingredients made it worth it. Guac will cost you extra which is always a bit of a jip but still won't stop me from going back. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today and glad we did! We ordered steak and pulled pork burritos with all the toppings (including guacamole of course) and it was delicious! We'll be back for sure. Just a few suggestions though...we did order take away and by the time we got home, the burritos were a little on the cold side. We thought if they warmed the meat prior to putting it in the burrito, it would stay relatively warm if not eating it right away. Another suggestion would be the option of a smaller sized burrito. Thank god I was hungry tonight though! But in the case that I wasn't starved, I would have probably opted on a smaller size if there were one. And of course delivery would be sweet as I'm sure people would order.  Such a nice alternative to the same old. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with the good - because it was very good! The service. Also very good I felt like I was in the servers house they were so sweet and sense my discontentment and offered some sweet nachos. Which are great. 
Most expensive burrito I've ever had and  not the best. (Actually $20 that's madness!) Guac was almost $3. Limited selection of toppings. Cilantro? Green onions? Corn? What's the deal!? Hot was not actually that hot at all. Probably would not go back because of cost mostly. Which I know these awesome servers have nothing to do with. Actually the best servers I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Totally dissapointed...

Went there one afternoon, asked for pozole and even tho that soup is in the menu, they didn't have it. So, I opted for some tacos. 

Like a Mexican craving for authentic and tasty food. I won't return there. 

The tortillas not only didn't taste like they were supposed to... I'm sure they are trying to make their own mixture of flours and they have no clue (is there something worst that a wanna be tortilla?). If they were honest, they just would buy the tortillas from a Mexican store. 

The cochinita and al pastor taco, just tasted like boiled pork. The only thing I can rescue is the grilled chicken. But if I had had craving for tasty chicken, I just would've gone to a Portuguese Rosticery."}
{"text":"Asada used to be one of my go-to's when I needed a quick, tasty and healthy meal in the 'hood. The food isn't \"authentic\" by any means but it was still tasty enough.

Unfortunately I have to say the quality of their food has dropped in the past while. Tonight I ordered a Baja Fish Rice Bowl, and the Fish was definitely not the normal type of fish that they use for the Baja Fish... it was super \"fishy\" tasting in a way that was very offputting, and I LOVE seafood! It was a dark pink colour, definitely not the usual white, lighter-tasting fish that they typically use and that is typical with Baja Fish-style tacos. I actually had to scrape all the fish out of the batter and I just ate the batter with the rest of my bowl.

And that brings me to the rest of the bowl.... almost inedible because the rice was so undercooked and hard! So disappointing. I'm not sure if they are under new owners recently or  they are just trying to cut corners somehow, but I will not be going back for a long while in the hopes they change things back to the way it was before, when the food was fresh, well-made and tasty! Hope that happens!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to discover that after years of living in the neighbourhood, I had never been to this amazing Mexican delicacy of a spot. Not only is there a lovely patio overlooking St Clair West, but the food is authentic, fresh, and yummy, and there is plenty of beer to go with your tacos! 

I was greeted by a friendly woman behind the counter who informed me that the recipes are authentic Mexican and the meat is hormone-free. That is pretty amazing given the low price point. They also make their own corn tortillas as well as offering a variety of alternatives (whole wheat, white flour, etc.).

The bathrooms are very clean and I am generally impressed with the entire idea behind this business: affordable yet fresh and delicious. LLBO licensed! On that note, Stockyards and Sea Witch could learn a thing or two about the importance of offering beverages to complement their food. 

The guacamole and the chorizo tacos are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer at Asada for the past three years and at one time would have given them a 5 star rating. My last few visits however, have completely changed my opinion about this once great establishment. 

I must begin by saying, I completely understand that new employees need time to train and learn and may not know everything BUT there should always be at least one experienced person present to steer new employees in the right direction, and there was not! 

The prices at Asada used to be a tiny bit pricy yet reasonable due to the quality of the food. Now I feel completely ripped off. I ordered the Baja shrimp tacos yesterday. I have ordered this at least 20 times over the years and you are supposed to get 2 pieces of shrimp per taco. My boyfriend and I had only one piece per taco, and each ordered a cup of horchata and our total came to over $40! We were completely shocked and extremely disappointed as we could have gone to a much nicer sitdown restaurant instead.

I left yesterday feeling very disappointed in the quality that has been allowed to slip so low and outraged that I am being gauged for so much money when what I am receiving is completely subpar. The owner and staff here used to take so much pride in their business and I am very sad to say that that pride is not apparent at all anymore. I felt embarrassed for the staff yesterday, they didn't know what Baja style was for my order of tacos...I had to tell them what the ingredients were and there was no one experienced enough to assist them. There was no flow of order and it felt very chaotic. The new Yonge Street location is more of the same story. There is just no level of professionalism anymore.

After all these years of going to a place that used to be one of my very favorite Mexican restaurants, I am sad to say I will not be returning and wasting my money here again.

Here's hoping you will return to your former glory."}
{"text":"Had a gluten free \"burrito salad\". Very friendly staff,great food, huge portion, and their beef is hormone free!"}
{"text":"Just had delivery .. steak burritos with the works extra spicy .. got no napkins with my order but food was good lots of steak"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian. Went there for veggie box. Employee really needs a training as there was lots of food mixing. I can not have my food contaminated. No way...they take really long time to prepare order. Food taste was okay but they were out of cheese i mean come on...i won't go there again. Nnnnop"}
{"text":"I've tried the fish tacos and they are so far my favorite item on the menu!  Great flavour, fresh ingredients and decent portions.  There's a great variety of meats as well as veggie options.  You have to ask for the Secret Menu box...you can have it with whichever meat you prefer or veggie only - it is delish!  Great healthy option in the area :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on their food handling procedures. As I was at the counter, the person serving me was refilling the pulled pork. She accidentally had some pork fall onto the counter where people lean up against with their belongings/who knows when that was last cleaned. She then just scooped it back with the rest of the pulled pork. I commented that this wasn't sanitary, and they offered me another selection of meat instead of actually replacing the pulled pork that had been contaminated--so whoever came next got a burrito full of that. I left because now it was pretty apparent staff aren't properly trained/or invested in ensuring safe food handling."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a number of times and they are very consistent.  

I used to think burrito boyz was the best until I found Asada. Their burritos are more unique , tastier and also larger.  They are crispy on the outside which I enjoy. Not many burrito places perform this extra step.

They also have a salsa bar which is complementary.

If you are a burrito fan, I would highly recommend you come check out AsAda at St. clair West.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In an age when the fast food industry is dominated by chain restaurants that put cheap prices ahead of quality, it is refreshing to see something completely different. Asada Mexican Grill does exactly that. Fast service, great food and modest pricing.

I've eaten here several times now, and it is now on my must-do list every time I visit Toronto. Why do I keep coming back here? The food is super fresh, and the varied menu items are completely prepared on premises from their own recipies. The flavors are unique, a pleasant surprise to one used to the bland sameness of the chain TexMex joints. The food alone would be ample reason to haunt the place, but the super-friendly staff there really do a great job. They took the time to explain all the options and toppings my first time there, and we created a meal that I was dying to try. I was hooked from the first bite of my grilled shrimp baja taco! Now when I go back, they remember me and ask me if I want to try something new.

The food there is not what I expected. It's a new spin on the Mexican fast-food classics. I don't think they use lard at all, the salt is very moderate, and the spice is complex and unique, not hot at all unless you opt for one of their homemade hot sauces to top off your creation. Their condiments are fresh and tasty additions to any taco or burrito. They only have 2 dessert items, but both are good, should you still have room. I've tried their horchata and jamaica drinks (they make those from scratch too) and I like them both, but I usually end up washing down my meal with a bottled soda or a cold Tecate on the patio, while watching the people walk by on St. Clair West. Yes, they are licensed :)

Love this place. Try it. You will be craving it until your next visit!"}
{"text":"Basically you pick your vessel for your toppings to be piled into, either burrito, taco, box or Torta (which are not made anymore) your filling then away you go. 
I Ordered the flour white soft tacos (comes in 3's) 2 with grilled chicken and one with the pulled pork to top em all off I added lettuce guacamole and cheese and to wash it all down house made horchata.  My other half also ordered 3 tacos and a coke it came out to just over $30. You might think $30 is quite a bit for a few tacos and drinks, but in my mind the quality of the food makes the price fair. 

What I love was the fact that they have all the stuff already prepped but they put it out \"on display\" in small portions so that you don't end up with brown lettuce and dried out meat. I saw bowls filled with cut tortillas standing by and ready to freshly deep fry if you just so happen to have a nacho craving.

 We liked the food so much we ended up splitting a tres leche cake for $4 some odd i think it was $4.95 it was EXCELLENT very fresh tasting. It also had a nice spring to the cake so much so that the milk just soaked right into the cake but the cake still held up to all the liquid it was sopping up. It was a great wrap up to a good meal. 

Staff: I want to especially mention the line manager for the night, she was so super friendly, and once she found out it was our first time there she made sure to explain everything about the restaurant with a ton of gusto!  She def made the experience a good one. 

In short - it's a definite try if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill in such a bad way that I went from being a regular weekly customer to not eating there anymore. Disregard all previous reviews from anything over a few months.  The fish in the tacos is disgusting and hey discontinued the pulled chicken.  They're always out of everything. Sad as it used to be an amazing place."}
{"text":"I like this place but it seriously needs some help.  I like the food, the staff and the look but the way it's run and organized is painful to watch. it took forever for the food - all three staff were running around like crazy and unable to get guacamole for almost 10 min as customers waited. And with the food being as pricy as it is (25 bucks for 3 tacos and a burrito) I don't see this establishment staying open much longer. I write this review hoping the owners get a clue and make some changes before you go out of business. Goodluck!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad with the food but for Mexican it was flavourless.  
$2.75 to add guacamole is just ridiculous.  
Going to have to pass on this place next time I have a Mexican craving. Something that's just okay doesn't deserve a repeat."}
{"text":"Not the best burritos in town but ok for the area. 

They have lots of space and a front patio. As the service is slow,  avoid the Fridays"}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is one of the best Mexican places in Toronto, especially in this pricerange. I've been going regularly since they opened, and it really reminds me of the taquerias in California more than anything. Easily better than Burrito boyz, big fat burrito, etc.

They don't keep much of the meats prepared, which means that more often than not it's cooked to order. They offer 3 types of tortillas iirc and 4+ types of beans. The meat options are also plentiful, and vegetarian orders get pickled onions + jalapenos. The guacamole is worth adding as well, in my opinion.

The sauce bar is well stocked as well - there's tons of variety and the best part is they're all good.

The dessert section of a taqueria is usually pretty overlooked but I strongly recommend the dulche de leche cake and the dessert nachos if you're looking for a little extra. The horchata is definitely worth trying as well."}
{"text":"One star equals a half star for quality and a half star for customer service. So-so food coupled with clueless staff. If you are thinking of trying this over-rated dive, drive on by and head  to any of the more authentic Mexican restos further west along St. Clair. Staff act like in-store customers are invisible, choosing to ignore them while filling online orders. Not worth the time or trouble."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Asada on Yonge to open for a while now. First off, the service was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and eager to answer any questions. It's refreshing to have an alternative to the very popular Chipotle at Yonge and Eglinton, expecially with the rather negative press Chipotle has been receiving this year. Asada is the real deal, authentic Mexican flavors and all made by hand. It's food you can feel good about. I will certainly be back, welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent burritos and tacos! Choice of flour or corn tortillas and a salsa bar."}
{"text":"As someone who loves burritos I was offended by this place. The portions are a joke considering the cost and once you take a bite you're even more offended because now it's overpriced, small, and taste wack. Their food has no flavour whatsoever. Guac is extra. The service is alright and they have like a salsa/hot sauce station. But other than that this place is laughable. I absolutely would not recommend. Go anywhere else on the St Clair strip. This place is not worth your money or effort. Fair warning."}
{"text":"These folks make tasty burritos and have become one of my favourite spots for a quick bite in the area.  The pulled pork is delicious.  They do have some consistency issues though... Twice now I've gotten undercooked rice.
For other options here... The nachos with guacamole are very popular though I haven't tried them myself (who has room after a burrito?).
So check this place out!"}
{"text":"I worked next door at Wychwood Open Door. I unfortunately discovered this place towards the end of my tenure. They have amazing taco bowls and great service. It should be packed more."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've ever had. Nice to know the meat is hormone free. Food tastes great, friendly knowledgable service, clean. They even have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Good food. But takes forever. The last three times I have gone the chicken isn't ready. And you have to wait 15min for it to be made. So I left. Too expensive too. Not like the chipotle it wants to be."}
{"text":"I visited Asada for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The employees were very friendly and passionate about the food they were preparing, leaving me with no doubt that my burrito was being prepared with care (unlike your run of the mill, assembly line sandwich shop).

I can't remember exactly what I got on my veggie burrito other than the fact that I don't recall saying \"no\" to any of my options. It tasted great, and was quite filling. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to grab a quick bite. I ordered a small Aguas Frescas Horchata($3.45+tax) and a Adada Box of the Al Pastor (aka marinated pork, $9.95+tax). The drink was very light and refreshing, which is exactly the same words I would use to describe their burrito bowl. The marinated pork had pineapple in it and I was not a big fan of the spices used, everything was just a little bland and I had to make use of a lot of extra salsa and limes to add more flavors to the dish. My friend ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for it to be grilled; most of it was still cold when it was served to her. 

All in all, the environment was very nice but the food could've been much better."}
{"text":"Opened Yelp on a Saturday night as I was in the area to try a new restaurant. Decided on this place as they were open late and seemed quite unique and we were interested in trying something new.

As we got there, we were greeted by a lovely girl behind the counter who greeted us in such a positive and happy vibe (too bad I didn't get her name). She made our first experience here so enjoyable, open, accomodating, and friendly. She quickly explained what they had to offer on the menu and offered a few recommendations. We were quickly sold on how amazing the menu was, and how unique this place stood out from the usual Chipotle and Mucho Burrito chains.

We ordered the 3 tacos and had different meats on them to try and all were filled with the perfect size of toppings. The meats were so tasteful, delicious, and juicy. At the end of it all, we were so satisfied and it definitely fulfilled our empty stomachs. I was so amazed by the service and attitude of the girl who served us, as she came from behind the counter to our table to check up on us and engaged in conversation with us to hear what we thought about the food, which was above and beyond what I expected from a nice small mexican grill place on St. Clair. If I'm ever in the area again, I would for sure stop by to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good  or really good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.

This was a solid 4 Star experience

5 star
Their Hot Sauces and attitude (warm and welcoming)
4 Star
Food - very tasty meats and fresh vegetables and toppings
Cleanliness 
3 Star
Price
Nothing 2 star or 1star about the place


Much better than Chipotle but also about 20% more expensive. Super tasty, light and authentic. Money well spent but would go more often if cheaper"}
{"text":"Fast food done right, that's all you need to know. It's makes the whole dining experience that much more special when you can feel the energy and enthusiasm that the staff have for the place. These aren't your normal teenagers working for Mickey D's. The staff were cutting fresh veggies as we walked in (always a good sign). We were greeted with a little background about Asada since it was our first time visiting. I had a hard time deciding between all the yummy tacos, and was given the option to mix and match. Music to my ears! So it was chorizo, cochinita pibil and fish for this gal. They came on freshly made tortillas and garnished with salsa and slaw. There are also an salsa bar to the side, so next time I know I'm getting chips to try every single one of them. All the tacos were great, so you can't really go wrong, but the cochinita pibil was juicy and oh so flavourful. Definitely need to try that one. My dining companion got the veggie burrito and it was enormous, so come with an appetite if you get that. The staff came to check on us half way through and gave us a sample of their cinnamon sugar tortilla chips. The music they played was also excellent, a mix of blues, jazz and 90's pop."}
{"text":"most delicious burrito i ever ate

the tortilla is like a gentle blanket made of jersey fabric, it swaddles the babby of food

the meats is lik e\"omg\"

they pack so much stuff in there the burrito feels like ur pumping iron when u pick it up to take a bite

some hot chicks work there too

a creamy meat wonderland in your mouth with a little bit of spicy 

if u get the chorizo sausage, ur gonna say \"loves it\""}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews. Ordered a chicken burrito. It was okay, kind of on the boring side and I got everything on it. It's a good sized burrito so if you're hungry that's good. The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Super super friendly staff. I have the chicken asada box which is delicious and my son has the 3 taco with beef, the price is about 10 dollars per person the portion size is decent."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burrito I've had! I definitely recommend eating here! Friendly staff and great service! Also, do not forget to add their Baja sauce onto your meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious and good service. Very generous portions tried the burrito and the dolce cake. Good job!"}
{"text":"I have an Asada Box with Steak and a Lime Jarritos! 17 bucks! Alittle on the pricey side! Over all a good taste but I felt there was not enough cheese and the steak was bland! The Sweet Nacho must be eaten right away mine got soggy!"}
{"text":"First off, the people working here are fantastic!  They know their food and are very friendly.  On my first visit, they went out of their way to explain the menu, the ingredients they use, etc.
I have been a couple of times since and have had the chicken Asada Bowl, with a mix of grilled and pulled chicken.  The food has always been fresh and well proportioned.  
I have made the switch from Chipotle to Asada!"}
{"text":"We went near closing and the staff informed us that a number of tacos were unavailable due to an especially busy day.   Although our options were limited my party and I enjoyed the chicken tacos and al pastor tacos.  We liked the selection of toppings as well as the salsa bar.  I found the soft corn shells lacking, by the time I reached my third taco the shell was like a wet napkin and the meat fell out.   Overall Asada is worth the trip and I would go back to try their beef and pulled pork tacos."}
{"text":"Huge portion, friendly staff and most importantly their burritos taste so much healthier (hence the \"lack of flavor\" I guess) than a lot of burrito places in town. 

I can agree with a lot of yelpers here that their burritos are pricey and it still bothers me that guac is not complimentary. Other than that, I am a fan and have returned several times already! ;) 

Value: 3/5 
Ambiance: 4/5 (nice decor and huge communal space)
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a friend, I enjoyed a grilled Fish Burrito. 
This was my third time coming to this restaurant and I have enjoyed it each time. Both other times I have order the chicken so I decided to venture off course.

The burrito was spicy, but flavourful, the service was efficient, but the best part was my interaction with the staff. We spoke with the owner while waiting for our meal, and it became apparent that he cares very much about the quality of food he serves, and how much people enjoy it.

I highly recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the amount of stars. 
Restaurant looked clean and as soon as you walk in you smell and see the smoke off the grill. It's not bad but over time it can get to you. 
Parking is on the street and don't forget to pay the meter maid. 

Staff was friendly did a great job in service, with exception of the cashier, she was not friendly at all. 
People got confused in terms of where to line up and I had to tell 3 people that they are waiting in the pay line and pointed them to where they should be lining up.
Order two things: The Baha Burrito and grilled fish tacos (one order gives you three tacos). Just these two items alone cost me $28!!!
Yelp saying it is $ is definitely wrong. More like $$$

The wait was 15 minutes due to the fact that they made it fresh but still felt it took too long. 

The burrito was Baha style and it was ok. A little bland for my taste. 
The grilled fish tacos was also ok  and no \"wow\" factor except the price. 

Would I order there again? Probably not. I prefer Chipotle over Asada anyday."}
{"text":"The place is OK for a quick bite. It's cheap and cheerful. However, don't expect much. It's not exactly the most authentic Mexican food.

I got the Asada Box. It came with rice, baked beans (selection of two), meat and some toppings. The meat was flavourful, but was overcooked and not very generous. All the toppings were not the freshest. The meal does not come with tortilla and when I asked for tortilla on the side they asked for $.50 for a small one, or $.90 for a large one. A bit steep, if you ask me."}
{"text":"I routinely order Mexican from Chipotle and Asada and I have to say Asada has Chipotle beat. Like Chipotle, Asada offers multiple platforms like burrito, nachos, quesadillas, the Asada box (basically the burrito bowl) etc. Chipotle is cheaper and offers more volume (depending on who's working, you could get them to pack loads of toppings in your burrito bowl). But Asada wins on flavour and freshness, with all their varieties of protein being markedly distinct from one another (the same cannot be said for my experience with Chipotle). Make sure you get the Baja sauce on whatever you order! Given the choice, I would time and again pay the premium to get Asada over Chipotle."}
{"text":"Hit the spot. Fresh, large portions, great value. Enjoyed the clean and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my ex BF in the sack: thoroughly disappointing. I stopped by absolutely ravenous and the place was poorly run. All employees seemed very confused. I waited way too long. The meat portion was SO small and the meat looked VERY unappetizing. I apparently had the bottom of the tray meat, so right after I was served a fresh batch came in 

I got home, took two bites and basically threw $11.25 in the garbage... guess I'll be calling delivery later. Worst"}
{"text":"This is my favourite fast Mexican food spot in Toronto. Everything is made fresh, including the flash fried nacho chips. They serve beer as well. Friendly, efficient service and super clean. Like a better version of California's Baja Fresh chain. Burritos are heavy !"}
{"text":"Delicious! I still remember my first bite into that chicken taco... This is definitely not Chipotle! The food is freshly made and the owners are so passionate about their business. Just makes me want to support this establishment even more.

Also at the end of our meal, the owner's daughter gave us free sweet nachos. OMG!!! It was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent, don't get the hype? How can you love a place where the meat is precooked in a warmer tray?"}
{"text":"the meats, I tried the steak and the chicken, are grilled to perfection and FRESH : juicy, charred and meaty.  its a multi-layered goodness, with the meat you get red Mexican rice soaked with all that you add for free: tomato sauce, pickled red onions, cabbage, cheese, hot salsas (spicy, mild and medium) that are fresh and full of flavor, I'd buy a bottle if they sell. they even have a salsa bar for free that has also onions with cilantro, lime and lemon. The quality is great and prices reasonable.  you can add for extra grilled veggies & onions, and their delicious guacamole. 

the women who work there are the friendliest I've met, please don't forget to tip them! they work hard to make the place the quality that it is. 

There was one time , it was late where the steak was a bit dry. i'm sure if I pointed that they would have changed it because they are so awesome."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service and plenty of room to seat parties of 6 or more.

Two types of Modelo about $6 or less per bottle. Dos XX and Corona too.  Take debit.

Wish they had patio seating on Yonge street though."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican fast food (though there is nothing fast about their slow roasted pulled pork and grilled chicken).  Everything tastes fresh and when you taste and see the avocado in the guacamole you know it is the real deal.  

What moved this review to five stars is the staff.  They took the time to explain the menu. I even has an opportunity to speak with the owner who demonstrated pride in offering quality at reasonable prices.  I live in the east-end but will make the effort to come back whenever I'm in the Wychwood 'hood!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and very friendly staff. 
It's like chipotle but with less sodium. Very Tex mex style. Would I eat here again.. Probably if I am craving a burrito (there aren't too many good Mexican places around here) but not if I want good tacos, I'd try to make them at home.extra star for the friend staff- otherwise is average."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time food is amazing! Best burritos and fish tacos in town! ( I've only ever had the fish) 
Steak burritos are amazing, they use REAL STEAK grilled to perfection, specialty toppings are what really make this burrito the best, pickled onions, cabbage, o.j's, and their hot sauce is actually hot! And the staff is always super friendly!  
This place won't disappoint, I promise! 
Hopefully it won't be much longer until their new location opens!!"}
