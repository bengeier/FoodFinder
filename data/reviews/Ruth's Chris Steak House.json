{"text":"If I was rich I would go here more! Cowboy ribeye with extra butter sizzling and some side onion rings or steak fries.  I love the sizzling steak! And if you have room for dessert you wont be disappointed! If your a Costco member you can buy two $50.00 gift certificates for $80.00 at Costco."}
{"text":"Just went for valentines day... The service was the best I have ever had but the steak was not. I was a tad disappointed ... I was expecting a steak like at Michael Jordan's restaurant in Chicago as they are both steakhouses but they were def not the same ... The best thing on the menu was the squash casserole ... Sooo good ... But alas the steak was below par and I'd rather have the keg especially for the price ... Price was way to high for the quality you got in my opinion."}
{"text":"Always have excellent service, I sit in the bar dinning or patio.  Bar staff has taken the time to memorize my name and drink, I only visit once or twice a month. Food is consistent and we'll prepared. I do not eat red meat but the chicken and fish are always amazing along with everything else I have eaten there:)"}
{"text":"Ordered the fillet and it did not disappoint! Cooked perfectly. The service was good considering how busy it was. Will be bringing all my friends here for some awesome steak!"}
{"text":"i don't care this place is expensive... you only get what you pay for! this was hands down the best steak i've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"A fantastic option for bigger corporate dinners, with especially professional service at the downtown location from Steve and Laura Beth. Lamb chops and bread pudding, best on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place !!!!!!!!! what can you say about the steak my and i love the one in san diego if you want  kobe steak come to Ruth's chris and treat your self"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night for my wife's Birthday. This was always our go to spot. They must have had an off night as  everything was below standards. We both ordered 8 oz filets but my wife's was about 5 oz.  Neither steak was very thick and there was no sear or caramelization on the outside.
The fries were soggy and limp and the experience was disappointing!
I see the have new management, bless their hearts!
The table next to us had issues as well but did say Mastro's was excellent."}
{"text":"nice restaurant!!! you won't be disappointed!! 
Nice Juicy steak and good service!
It is pricy but you are paying for the good foods!"}
{"text":"I must say, I expect that a steakhouse would know the difference between a steak cooked medium and one cooked medium rare. Unfortunately they do not. I ordered a steak at medium, and it came medium rare..then they brought it back and it was well done. Ok, lets try again, second time around they made the same mistake. At that point I lost my patients and had to leave. I been at many Ruth Chris restaurants and I expect the best in customer service and in the best cooking quality. When the general manager came over to apologize, he was being extremely rude and consenting. I felt very disrespected as a customer. When I go to a restaurant with high standards such as Ruth Chris i expect great foods and great customer service. I left feeling disappointed and upset that one of my all time favourite restaurant is now one that I will bare to go to. I enjoy a perfectly cooked steak. I was just recently at Surur Lees restaurant, and ordered the filet and it was perfect! I will definitely go they're next time I have a steak fix (not a steakhouse called Ruth Chris)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch! I had the mixed grill and my husband had a petite filet with shrimp. I highly recommend the mixed grill.  Mash potatoes were o.k.; service was very good and prompt. Very pleasant dining! Yes, a bit formal for me but...their steak!! Their chicken was just as good!"}
{"text":"First off I am new to Yelp so I was surprised that I could make a reservation when looking up the location to Ruth's Chris. That was awesome. The dining experience was perfect, from beginning to end. I was reluctant to go there because I didn't have such a great experience at the one in LV. Glad we went & will definitely be back. :) thank Alejandro"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Went to ruth chris in rosemont,il it was excellent came back to try middletons and sad to say it wasnt worth it. I ordered mac n cheese as a side and.... Its out of a box this is disappointing since they do charge 9-10 for the side. I def will not be coming back to middleton!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here 2 weeks ago with friends. We had such a fantastic time. I ordered the petite filet medium rare with creamed spinach and both were orgasmically delicious!!! Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed there meal and experience. Service was top notch as well as the view we had from our booth. I highly recommend going here for any special occasion or just because. I am a lover of red meat and they knocked it out of the park!!! 

We have been to the one in Palm Desert and that Ruth's just does not measure up to this one as far as the food goes. My husband and I have been here a few times now and they never fail!!!  Yummy yummy for your tummy!!!"}
{"text":"I think this steakhouse is the most overrated ever considering the premium prices that you are paying for.  There are much better restaurants out there that give you much better food for the price that you pay at Ruth's Chris.  

The thing that makes Ruth's steak flavor is butter, excessive use of butter.  While ingredients such as butter, onions, garlic are good it should compliment not define the taste of a steak."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  No better description.  We arrived early and Dolli made us feel so at home and welcome.  We enjoyed a drink before dinner and looked at the menu.  From there Jeff served us and we were extremely well taken care of.  Very enjoyable.  The filet was memorable and perfect.  Lobster delicious!  All the sides were memorable too!  I also recommend Ruth's Gin and Tonic, exceptional!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during Big Taste week and boy am I glad I did. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere is that of an upscale restaurant. There is also free parking available at the Palliser West parkade when you get a ticket from the host at the front for evenings and weekends.

I tried out their Big Taste menu which consisted of three courses plus cheesey garlic bread. The appetizers consisted of two different salads or a gumbo. I opted for the Cesar salad, which was ok but I felt there was a lot of lettuce and not a whole lot of anything else. There were about 5 or 6 croutons plus one cherry tomato and a light drizzle of dressing.

The entree was a choice of petit fillet, stuffed chicken breast, or a seafood duo of salmon with scallops, squid, or shrimp plus 6 different sides of vegetables to choose from. I picked the salmon with scallops and a side of lyonnaise potatoes. Right when you order and again when your food arrives, you will be warned about the extremely hot plates they're on and that you shouldn't touch for about 10-15 minutes. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the scallops were a bit disappointing: you either get two small ones or one slightly larger plus half of another one. I got the latter. I found the scallops to be just a tad overcooked and the seasoning used was a bit spicy, which I didn't know about beforehand. The potatoes were pretty good and generously proportioned. 

Dessert: ice cream, seasonal berries, chocolate sin cake, creme brulee, or sorbet. I chose the creme brulee and let me tell you, it was the best I've ever had. They used real vanilla beans, it was not too sweet and very creamy. Yum!

Overall, I was very satisfied with my dinner and left extremely stuffed. I will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"It was our 2 year anniversary so my wife and I decided to actually go out to a nice place as \"Ruth's Chris Steak House\", I was about to surprise her with a gift but they came through quicker with a nice thick piece of nose hair in her salad. I'm disgusted  never coming back there again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the old Ruth Chris location and the atmosphere of the new location has changed dramatically. It now caters to tourist and the romantic, intimate settings are gone. The food is pretty much the same- 500 degree plates that continue to cook your meat, service that is wonderful, bar that is what it used to be. I was kind of let down. Had a great booth overlooking the giant sign that lights up brightly at 8 pm and the cement building of the hotel next door. So much for intimate and romantic. While my date and I are dressed up, the people across the aisle sat in Bermuda shorts. I know they have a dress code but obviously it has changed along with the change of location. I am sure this works out well for the corporate America that has taken over the Casino life in Vegas, but some of us still like intimate and romantic when spending mega bucks for a dinner.  I"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a nice steak dinner while we were visiting Las Vegas. There are many choices when it comes to a fine Steakhouse in Vegas. I'm glad we chose Ruth Chris Steakhouse. 

    Our waiter John was fabulous, he was friendly and very helpful to us in our wine and menu selections. The steaks that we ordered came out exactly the way we wanted and tasted great. The baked potato was split in the kitchen for us and the green beans were prepared expertly. 

    We don't splurge like this very often, so when you spend that kind of money on a nice dinner it's nice to have everything turn out so wonderful. 

   Thank you for a great dinning experience that my wife and I will remember for a long time. Thanks again John."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place, but if you ask me, your money is better spent elsewhere... Vintage Steakhouse is much better in my opinion...

Why do I say this? First, it's a chain restaurant, beautiful inside, but lacks creativity on the menu and individuality in its atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good steak but kind of inconsistent because sometimes I've found that they overlook my medium steak. Usually I like my steak medium or even a little on the medium rare side but occasionally I have had my steak over cocked which makes the steak lose slot of flavour. On a more positive note the steaks are really thick and juicy when done right and I would refined trying the salmon steak it's very good especially dice I never really have the fish steaks at restaurants but my dad said that I had to try it and I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"I went to Ruth's Chris Steak House for the first time during the Winterlicious event.  We were seated in a reasonable time but had to ask for our menus once we could finally get a hold of a server.  It took a long time for the server to come to our table to ask us if we wanted beverages.  Once the server did bring out beverages we were served the amazing warm bread and finally were able to place our dinner orders.  We received our food in a reasonable time frame.  The reason is we waited for a server to initially come to take our orders, etc.  But yet the servers were very quick to remove our plates even though we were not finished eating.  They did not ask if we were finished prior to taking our plates they just removed them.  I actually had to stab the pie just as the server was going to take it away as I was not done yet.  So slow to take our orders and fast to take away our food (that part I was not impressed with).  

Our waitress was nice, friendly and professional.  

Hostesses were ok.  Professional but I found a little snobby.

Our dinner was amazing WITH the exception of our salads.  To say the least I was not impressed and neither were my dinner companions.  Two of us ordered the Caesar salad and when we received the salad is was not at all what a Caesar salad should be like.  Our salad consisted of the core pieces of romaine lettuce (no leafy greens at all) and the dressing tasted more like mayo instead of a Caesar dressing.  For a restaurant such as this I would never have expected this.  If I were working in the kitchen it is something I would definitely NOT serve customers.

The funny part was that as I had mentioned before they were quick to clear our plates but yet once we finished our meal and were sitting chatting they never asked us to leave.  So I felt rushed during the time we were eating and then relaxed after our meal was complete.

Loved the ambiance of the restaurant and the lay out."}
{"text":"We'd never been there before and thought that we'd give it a try. The hostess greeted us upon arrival and was very pleasant. We were seated right away. We did not wait for our drink orders to be taken; the waitress was right there to explain everything to us. Angie was great and repeatedly checked up on us to make sure that we were ok. The problem was the food. I ordered Lobster Bisque and it was just not as expected. Barely any small little bits of lobster in it at all and the flavor was not great. I had ordered a NY strip med/rare with an order of shrimp to go with it. The shrimp was dry and tough and the steak was raw in the middle. Poor Angie had to say that this was their med/rare but it was cold and purple in the middle and I knew that she was just trying to make it seem like it wasn't an error. Funny thing is that my husband ordered his filet medium and it also came out raw in the middle. He just didn't say anything about it. What was most disappointing is that this is supposed to be one of the best places to get a good meal and to get what you pay for and it was just mediocre at best. You'd think that they would know how to prepare steaks to the letter by now. We live here and like to splurge on an expensive meal a few times a year but we won't be going to Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Not all Ruth Chris Steakhouses are the same. 

The servers are sincere but the food could not match. 

Day old bread, croutons from the box, microwaved potato, steak that was not only full of ribbons of fat but cooked to the point that it would qualify as charcoal.  

A franchisee that should be kicked out of the system if the parent wants to save its reputation."}
{"text":"Fantastic old school steakhouse.  Service is fantastic, food is flavorful and cooked to perfection.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant selection."}
{"text":"Just ate here and everything about our visit was awful! The food and service! And they weren't even busy! We had the calamari, filet oscar style cooked medium well, potatoes au gratin, broccoli and crab cakes. The steak came out well done and it was tough because it sat under the heating lamp so long. Again they were not busy so there's no excuse why the steak was overcooked. The crab cakes looked like they were undercooked in the middle. The broccoli was hard and the potatoes au gratin were terrible because the potatoes were cut so thick. Overall it was the worst experience we've ever had at a Ruth's Chris. We will never be coming back to any Ruth's Chris again. If I could give 0 stars I would.

Update: Was sick an hour later. Likely from the undercooked crab cake."}
{"text":"Went here for a special dinner with my wife. The food was phenomenal. We both ordered fillets. Made my taste buds explode. We will be back."}
{"text":"The asperigus was bland.  The rip eye steak was good although not worth the $75/a piece price. Service was ok. Waiter did not give us the breakdown of the bill even after we ask for it.  It was kind of dis-honest."}
{"text":"I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette. 
The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty. 
My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.

Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit."}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's birthday with 16 other friends.  The food and drink was good and the wait staff was attentive but they over-charged us $800 on our hotel folio despite having signed a receipt at the restaurant that accurate.

The worst part of it all is that they are fighting us and American Express over these over charges.  We won't go back here or to Caesar's again...it's a real shame."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, but it's obvious that they are a franchise and can't necessarily make special order items or alterations to the menu. Our server was very accommodating and checked with the kitchen multiple times to see if we could remove items from the entrée. Unfortunately this wasn't the case but I appreciate the effort.

I ordered the scallops on cheese polenta, and they were excellent. Great job blackening the scallops and on the red pesto, and the cheese polenta (although I'm not really into cheese) was wonderful. My companion got the fillet with mushrooms and that was cooked to perfection at medium rare.

It's a good deal if you take advantage of their frequent specials, or have some sort of certificate. Their service is over the top, and their manager will stop by your table even if you don't have a problem. 

My only issue, which you can get around if you understand it, is the inflexibility of their menu. Otherwise, good job."}
{"text":"Located inside the Harrah's Resort & Casino, this location has an amazing Happy Hour from 4:30-5:30 p.m. 

Three of the four of my group selected the Steak Sandwich ($12, with fries), which is amazing and a great value, especially considering the price nearly doubles to $22 after Happy Hour. The lobster dish was chosen by the fourth person, and while it tasted great according to him, the portion was conspicuously smaller. 

The Steak Sandwich comes on a garlic French roll/baguette, and the steak is topped with béarnaise sauce. It also comes with a generous portion of fries. I asked for mine medium-rare, but I did think it was closer to rare as some of the pieces looked like they had just been seared and the inside looked purple. I still ate it, though. And it was delicious. Next time, though, I will probably go for medium or medium-well which should equate to medium-rare.

The pomegranate martini is also a nice treat!"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon for lunch, which was a pretty decent portion. It is enough to last two meals. The fish was cooked a little more rare than I am used to, but I enjoyed it anyhow. Mashed potato's were amazing to say the least.

I don't mind the \"overpriced\" menu, that is fine with me. I would have given them a 4 star, but what really angered me was how the waitress took my plate without asking if I was done with it. I was just taking my time enjoying the company of friends, and while I was talking to the person next to me, the waitress snuck in like a ninja and took my plate from me. Seriously, when I turned back to my plate, it was gone. I can understand if my plate is empty and she takes it away, but I only ate 25% of the fish."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Ruth's Chris on a Friday night two weeks ago for dinner, and arrived at about 7:00pm.  My mom was told by Wendy at the hostess stand that the wait for the dining room would be about 20 minutes, and that if we wanted to eat in the bar, we could be seated immediately.  My mom said we'd wait in the bar for a table in the dining room because I had a migraine and we were told that live music would be starting shortly in the bar area.  After waiting in the bar for nearly an hour, my mom checked in at the hostess stand and asked about our table, and she was told that they thought we were eating in the bar.  Lori came to take us to our table (in the nearly empty dining room) and apologized for the wait.  We asked to speak to the manager, who came over to talk to us a few moments later.  He apologized as well and offered to bring us an appetizer, but at that point, we were just ready for dinner, so he offered to buy us a round of drinks.  Our server arrived shortly, and she was fantastic.  She told us that they would be buying us a round of drinks and took our order quickly.  Our food arrived shortly after, and the food was delicious, as it always is, and the service once we were in the dining room was great.  Once the bill arrived, however, it was clear that the round of drinks we were promised was not taken off of the bill.  We have eaten at Ruth's Chris many times and have always enjoyed the food, and have never been disappointed by the service before this time.  Unfortunately it will be a long time before we go back to the Middleton Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"This was my first time a Ruth Chris I have heard great thing about this chain. Its inside of Harrah's on the second floor. Strange when you ride in a elevator with glass windows and a view of a wall. But once the doors open the entrance to the dinning room was nice some seats you can see parts of the strip. Service was slow at the beginning took awhile for us just to get bottle water. If you live in Vegas you know not to drink tap water. Started with a bottle of Acrobat medium  red $54.00 not bad. App was spicy lobster which was a lightly fried lobster tossed in  spicy  cream sauce served with a tangy cucumber salad. $17.00. It was just OK.  I had a house salad iceberg, baby arugula, grape tomatoes, garlic croutons, red onion  with balsamic. $8.50 I order there Halibut special they did not have Halibut but had substituted sea bass $40.00. The Sea Bass was cooked perfect light flaky. Fresh tomato on the bottom Sea bass topped with crab and lobster meat this was great. My friend order a cowboy rib-eye $53.00 rare with sauteed onions. It came medium rare the onions where over salted server addressed and fixed this in less then ten minutes. My other friend had harvest salad an petite fillet $40.00 it was cooked medium rare which is how she ordered it. We choose the sweet potato casserole pecan crust  this is like a dessert its good.  Potatoes Au gratin Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce this was a much better side great flavors. Chef was nice to send out dessert bread pudding it was delicious.From beginning to end it was a good dinning experience and great prices. This is coming from someone who dines out a lot with friend and will pay for a great dining experience. This is one of the more affordable steakhouses on the strip. Also if you are traveling to Vegas or live here go get reward cards at all casino's they do help with cost."}
{"text":"This place is a real conundrum to me. Reliable Ruth Chris menu but I have to ask who is the bar manager? Wonderful brown liquors on the menu but they seem to show off raspberry flavored vodka more.  You can order a Manhattan here but they will put grocery store vermouth in it -- appalling for a drink at their price point. Someone has scared the bartenders into making sure everyone's water glass is full, to the point of neglecting drink service. I DONT WANT WATER, I DONT WANT BREAD AND BUTTER PLEASE JUST TAKE MY ORDER."}
{"text":"Great diner eat at rc all the time best steak you can buy."}
{"text":"The hype that this place carries is not justified in my experience here. I heard that people had their best steak here. I'm willing to splurge on a great meal, but quite honestly I could have had two gourmet meals for what we spent here. And the food just didn't wow us. At all. 

Started out with crab stuffed mushrooms. I would say they were forgettable but the fishiness lingers too long to forget. I had a cup of French onion soup ($10 of okay), a petite filet (MR) and mashed potatoes. My husband had their salad that was sold as being an explosion of flavor (sure if the flavor is mayonnaise), and a bone-in ribeye which was nothing great. My medium rare steak was well done on the outsides and MR through about 25% of it. Seasonings were nothing special. 

The service was robotic while the overall atmosphere was smug and pretentious. Honestly, I've had way better steak at Outback. I don't understand the allure here. I won't be coming back. Not on my dime anyway. We ordered a bottle of Malbec too. That was the highlight in a very dim dining room. I couldn't believe the $190+ bill for just an okay experience. I expect my socks to be knocked off for less."}
{"text":"We sat in the private dining area. There were 14 of us in our party.
The service and food was good. 
Apparently everyone's steak was decent. My only complaint is the lack of vegetarian protein and gluten free options available. Sounds funny requesting vegetarian meals at a Steak House but it isn't unreasonable since there are excellent alternatives available now like Gardein or Mock Meats which I have enjoyed in very high end steak houses all over N. America. A plate of Steamed veggies and no protein just doesn't quite complete the experience.
All in all it was a great experience just lacking in the alternatives department."}
{"text":"Delightful!

Great service & great food!

The friendly & attentive service just makes everything better.  When the food is already top notch, the level do customer service simply makes for a delightful evening.

The steaks are delivered to the table sizzling hot in a shallow bath of buttery juice.  They are tender & tasty.  The side dishes are generous in their proportions.  The only negative (and this is purely personal) is that the Blu cheese dressing consists of a heaping of the crumbles and little to no creamy dressing.  (Again, this is only personal but I prefer the creamy aspects in a dressing). Next time I will choose the chopped salad!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week dinner a bust. Started with an Ikd Fashioned. No Luxardo ones for me, I only rated the maraschino. So you think for $44 you get some tasty bites. The tomatoes soup with crab was good. Not as hot as it should have been but tasty. The entree, filet with shrimp was a strange cut of meat. Not a filet but what appeared like ends. It wasn't just mine, the second guest had the same and choose not to eat it. Creamed spinach which is usually amazing here was watery and not hot.  The horseradish arrived well into the meal and had to be requested twice. My husband had the seafood trip and the lobster was very over cooked. The desert was good. I asked for cutlery  and was told that my spoon was beside me. I prefer not to eat  cake with a spoon. And I especially prefer not to be reprimanded by my waiter. Yes you Ben. You were not obliging. Service was slow and grudging. Save your money. Don't bother with dinner here until after restaurant week is over."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines day.  It was about our 6th time there. We are new to Calgary!  Started with shrimp cocktail and...coconut shrimp usually delicious, was super dry and overdone, I didn't  eat them.  Then had slab of salad and IT'S ACTUALLY A SLAB, LITERALLY,  QUARTER OF A LETTUCE!! then the steak. My friend said hers was way under par and mine was so dry it was not edible, and had a distinct liver taste.  Tables were not all reserved. Lots of empty tables -  I was shocked, I have seen it bussier on a weeknight.  I'm assuming they are just too expensive or the quality or food went down. The bill was about 350.00 for us, two people, didn't even have wine. Steaks were about 60.00  each!! Anyways atleast I was in great company!!! Won't go back again!!! They lost me."}
{"text":"I have been to the Scottsdale Ruth's Chris several times for happy hour on the patio.  The view is amazing.  The problem is the service!

Last week my friend and I sat on the patio for 20 minutes as the wait staff walked around, ignoring us.  When we finally ordered our drinks (which we had picked from the website happy hour menu) we were told that those were not on the happy hour menu...the waitress had no intention of honoring the website list, nor discussing it.  

When our food came, my sliders were very dry...I waited for the waitress to come back around, so I could ask for mustard.  I waited...and waited...and waited....   Finally, I got up and asked the hostess to please get me some mustard.  Through the evening, I ended up asking the hostess for mustard, more water, and the bill because our waitress was missing in action.

We didn't decide to go to a local haunt for a drink, nor did we decide to go to a mega-chain restaurant.....we chose the upscale spot, payed the upscale prices and expected an upscale experience, which we did not get!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience.  Our server Matthew was outstanding.  The food came out perfect and delicious.  The manager, Anthony came by to see how our experience was.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I tried out Ruth's Chris a week ago for the first time. I really enjoyed the meal. A few comments:

1 - The food is very good. I liked the hot plates, and the sizzling buttery steak. The filet was tender, but not the best I've had. The sweep potato casserole was tasty. The crab cakes were good.

2 - I paid $120 for me and my girlfriend. At a price like this, I assume that the food is going to be good, and my question is always, \"How much better is this food than my $9 meal at Chipotle?\" Was it $120 good? I don't know... I would probably go back but not very often.

3 - The service was fine. But I didn't notice anything special or unusual about it, as it has been described in some of the other raving reviews on this site.

4 - The combo, where you get a starter, side, main dish, and dessert, for $53, is not worth it. It would be a great deal if you could choose any starter, side, or dessert. But the options that they allow with the combo are lame -- they don't include any of their good sides or starters. You're better off a la carte."}
{"text":"Ruths Chris is not a place you go once a week but if you're looking for a special night out there is no place better. The atmosphere is wonderful and all the servers there treat you like a special guest."}
{"text":"Yes this is a franchise steakhouse, but after receiving a gift card, I couldn't say no to a (mostly) free dinner. The gift card was $100, and paid about 75% of the final tab for two.I can definitely say that this is one of the best experiences I've had at a steakhouse. 
The decor is high end, and the seats are comfortable, especially for people like me who have a tendency to linger in restaurants. That being said, it does feel a bit stiff, and I believe caters to more of a corporate crowd.
Our server was...eager, which was really nice. He explained in detail how the kitchen was going to prepare our food, and even had a great sense of humour, which is a bonus.
My steak was cooked medium rare, as I prefer it, but I was surprised they had USDA beef on the menu, especially seeing as this is Alberta of all places.
Just a note that the side dishes at Ruth's Chris are enough for two, and are purchased seperately. They are substantial, and not just a filler to frame your steak. The creamed spinach I chose was legit! So unbelievably good, that I ignored my poor steak until the end. My steak was perfect, and covered in butter - this may be their secret. 
Great meal, great service, no complaints."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on Friday March 14th with some co-workers. There was 1 server and 3 tables only at around 12:30. We waited like 15 minutes to get our orders taken and then another 30 until the food came out...we only had a 1 hour lunch break like most jobs...so we were late...anyway, I got the \"prime rib burger\" and by the looks of the restaurant itself I thought I was going to get an amazing, well plated, gourmet burger...not the case. I got a thin burger with a bun that was so flimsy and falling apart that I was sure it was wonder bread, lettuce and onions on the side...that's it! No sauce or aioli on the burger, just a slice of cheddar cheese. The chips were good but served with ketchup when I was expecting some amazing dip for them. No one came to asks us how our meals were or to re-fill my water, not even the manager, whom I had complained to about our food taking so long . My 2 co-workers were pretty disappointed with their meals as well, one got the steak sandwich (was not impressive) and the other one got the shrimp and mashed potatoes which was more like an appetizer and was still hungry after and ended up going to Tim hortons for more food. For the price of the items, this lunch was not worth it...maybe the dinner is better..."}
{"text":"Best steak I ever had, period. It is worth every penny they charge.  After all, this is a steakhouse. The rest of the menu is just ok though for the price. The service was just so-so for an upscale place such as this.  

It's pretty noisy as the table next to us was very load."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the Filets with shrimp! Both dry dry and over cooked. Sides were not fresh! Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, this is indeed a 5-star restaurant in every manner.  5-star Quality, 5-star Service, 5-star ambiance....and, unfortunately 5-star prices.  Everything is A la carte, but the portions are huge.  Don't feel embarrassed about splitting a side - they won't look at you with disapproval.

You don't always get what you pay for, but at Ruth's - you do.  I would contrast it with Morton's where I had to pay $150 (for two) and had the second worst experience of my life (see Michelangelo's-Tucson for worst).

I've dined in several Ruth's and all three were extremely consistent.  I'd like to tell you what the menu has to offer, but I don't have much of a clue, because...

IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT FILET BABY !!   (med-rare please)

Hands down the best filet I've ever had.  They sear those things at extremely high temperatures in what has got to be an entire stick of butter.  Add salt and pepper and that's all she wrote.  You don't really need a knife for it - yep...it's that tender.  Pay attention to your servant regarding plate temps.  These things come to you IMMEDIATELY after being placed on a plate taken from a small furnace.  You WILL get burned if you attempt to touch the plate early on.  Aside from the fun sizzle factor, it keeps that gorgeous hunk of beef warm till the last tasty bite.

I do get the lettuce wedge on the side.  Picture an entire half of a nicely pruned AAAAA head of iceberg lettuce covered in bacon/bleu cheese crumbles.  Cover this in a side of bleu cheese dressing (what else?)...and you'll have the picture.  If it were any crispier, it would shatter.  As opposed to the filet, you will need both knife and fork to cut this; I defy you to find any blemishes in it.

I discovered creme-brulee at a Ruths.  We had some Cabernet left and were feeling like some sugar might be a nice accent.  Geez, I don't think they do much of anything mediocre.  I've never had a finer Creme...and I've been trying hard.

You will NOT be disappointed at Ruth's - but don't forget your wallet."}
{"text":"My husband and I just came home from a disappointing dinner and overall disappointing dining experience. We made reservations for dinner about 1.5 to 2 weeks ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We arrived for our reservation and were told that we would be seated shortly. About 10 minutes later we were offered a booth in the bar which to me was odd because we had reservations. Because we were celebrating our anniversary we really didn't want to sit in the bar so we chose to wait the additional 15 minutes.  We were seated in a lovely booth in the main dining area.  We ordered and enjoyed the bread, appetizers and our wine. My husband and I both ordered the  filet. My filet came out cooked just the way I ordered it (medium) but unfortunately my husband's came out very,very rare (he ordered it medium rare). His steak was sent back not only once but twice until they got it right. The manager was very nice and açcomodating and wanted to make sure my husband was happy.  Although my meal was delicious by he time my husband's came out  it was not hot anymore. He wanted me to eat while we were waiting for his so I did nibble a little but I wanted us to enjoy our meals together. 

At the end of the meal there was some food left over that I was going to take home and our waitress instructed the bus girl what we wanted to take home. The bus girl then proceeded to load our dishes on to a large serving tray and right next to the food that we were going to take home she bussed another table and put their dirty dishes right next to ours that contained the food we were going to take home. Seeing this completely made me sick so I  decided to just leave the doggy bag at the restaurant once the bus girl brought my food to the table from the back. We left the doggy bag at our table when leaving and she was nice enough to bring it out to us because she thought we forgot it.  I explained to her why we did not want to take it home. She was surprised and said that is just how they do it there. While we were waiting for the valet outside another employee ( I believe he may have been a manager - Chris)  came out and apologized. He told us that she was wrong and that it is not their standard to do that and he offered to make us more food to take home which was nice but at that point the valet was getting our car and we were ready to leave. He did give us a card for a free bottle of wine which did appease us at the time but then when we got home we realized that it is only a particular type of wine and it is only free if you purchase 2 meals and it expires in 2 months.  We usually love coming to this restaurant and have even been to this particular location many times but given this experience we will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with Ruth's Chris.  The decor was dated.  The servers reached across the table to serve and remove plates instead of properly from the left/right.  We were even asked to hand them our dirty dishes.  The plates they could reach were removed before we were finished with them.

I ordered my steak medium rare.  My steak came out very undercooked and rare.  I didn't eat any of it, I only sliced it down the middle with my knife.  I informed the waiter that my steak was undercooked and they brought me back the same piece of meat, overcooked this time to medium well and turned over to look like a new steak.

Also, it is common practice for steak houses to brush their steaks in butter.  The steaks at Ruth's Chris were served swimming in a pool of butter.  Pools of butter were also collecting in the appetizer and sides we ordered.

I dine at prime steak houses frequently and expected the service and quality of a prime steak house when I made my reservation at Ruth's Chris.  I would not consider Ruth's Chris to be worthy of my dollar or my patronage."}
{"text":"This place may have the atmosphere of the 1970s, but damn if the service isn't fantastic and the steaks delicious. Love it here, despite the location."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in any RC that I have been too.  This location was no exception.  This one was in a strip mall which was kind of weird.  The food was great, the service was fantastic, and they kept the reservations.  It was an anniversary for us and they made it special.  It is everything you expect from a great high end chain."}
{"text":"they were wonderful, the food and service is the best.
chopped salad and ny cheescake is our favorite."}
{"text":"Went for dessert and was accommodated with out complaint. Extremely friendly staff. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service are outstanding!  With that being said, I thought the food would be amazing; it was average (and that's being kind).   The filet was dry and even ordered as medium it was crisp.  The potatoes were runny and cool.  Horrible to say but as far as the food goes, the warm bread is all that met expectations and can honestly recommend.  I would recommend you go across the street to another establishment."}
{"text":"Website and YELP list restaurant hours for Sunday, opens at 4:00PM. In reality 4:30PM."}
{"text":"Dining at Ruth's Chris is always a treat.. I have dined at this local, Las Vegas, Nv for my wedding reception in March 2008, and also for a lunch as well as the San Diego harbor location for a New Years Eve Dinner..

If you don't like top quality meats or haven't had them, I defy anyone to find a better steakhouse.. You are paying for the steaks which are served on their signature 500 degree plates with sizzling butter.. I always go for the NYer, a side of creamed spinach.. 

I have never had a bad service or had to complain about my food. Trust me, I will make my displeasure known, professionally and courteously. You always get more flies with honey than vinegar. 

The food at Ruth's Chris is top notch. Sorry to hear about the other reviewers birthday problem. A call to the location and a talk with the general manager would have done wonders the next day.."}
{"text":"It was just okay. Went because we received a gift card, and I don't think I will return unless that happened again. There are many other places in Charlotte that offer wonderful steaks with a better atmosphere at half the price."}
{"text":"Ate a quick dinner at the bar on a Friday night.   Porterhouse for two, salad, and tuna tartare along with spinach and mushroom side dishes.  Service wasn't great, but that is what we expected since the bar was pretty crowded for the first hour we were there.  The food was great, better than I remembered Ruth's Chris to actually be back at home."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional..........kudos to wait staff. But the major problem comes with food, i asked my waiter is crab cake is fresh or not, she said yes of course. so i ended  up with order of crab cake sandwich for my lunch, unfortunately the crab cake was ice cold inside.......Anyways may be wait staff was not aware of this.........."}
{"text":"I booked a table 15 minutes before we arrived for our anniversary dinner, and made sure to include a note asking if it would be possible to have a nice quiet table for our special occasion. When we arrived, we were led to a table with heart-shaped confetti scattered along the middle of the table. It was my first time at Ruth's Chris, so it was definitely a nice first impression. 

The food was incredible. We had the porterhouse for 2, potatoes au gratin, and roasted brussel sprouts. The massive steak came out sizzling in butter, and the server served us the steaks on our own hot buttered plate. It was an out of body experience... in my mouth. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the brussel sprouts more (probably because it made us feel slightly better about all the butter. 

At the end of our dinner, the waiter brought over a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. It was an awesome experience from start to finish. I'd highly recommend Ruth's Chris if you're looking for a perfect night out."}
{"text":"Great service, most of the food was very good. Unfortunately, the beef tenderloin, which is why we go there, was very mediocre. Got the lobster and filet special,  neither of our filets were very good. I think the were end cut. Also, never got the béarnaise sauce we ordered.  Not a $125 meal.  Not looking for anything free so we did not complain."}
{"text":"The menu is expensive for expensive sake, not based on quality. We ordered stakes at medium rare and got them well done. $12 clam chowder was good with huge clams. $11 asparagus was a small portion and served with cold hollandaise.  The tiny winelist was boring and a discount was negligible by the bottle. The complimentary bread was a waste of time and space."}
{"text":"For me:
Great steak, on par with harbour 60 and the likes, but not the best I've had.
Crab cakes better than harbour 60.
Very good bread pudding.
This locations interior, view, etc is poor."}
{"text":"I delayed this critique.  It's so bad I had to think about it.  My wife and I went for the 1st time ever (4 Nov 17) and were really looking forward to it.  For the price, it was literally the worst experience we could have imagined.  I'm keeping this succinct as I don't typically do bad reviews but after telling my friends, they agreed I needed to post.

The waitress oversold blatantly.  The service was bad with at least 30 min breaks between servings.  Dish composition was incorrect.  The food quality was poor: how does a ribeye have no marbling?  Since when does sautéed spinach sit in a half inch of salty liquid?  I could go on.

For a meal well north of $250, totally expected better.  Don't anticipate a return visit."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this - but for that money I am expecting something different - the best was the bar tender

Have had a bone in filet for 70 or even 75 $ - the meat was not more than average.

Seems that people to not want to admit that the quality wasn't that good since they have paid so much that can not be true that's just ok (think about that you tell your friend \"hey! - I paid 500$ in food but it was just ok\"

But seriously - for 30$ i would have said 4* but for that money? Everybody who call for that kind of that food that much money have to deliver .... you did not"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 9 and had dinner in their glass enclosed private area which was very nice because we still had a good evening view but didn't have to worry about disturbing other patrons being loud.

The ambiance was nice for a steakhouse and was on point with other fine steakhouses. 

Our main complaints came from the service. We had 2 waiters and a water girl. We were there for a celebration so 2 bottles of champagne were ordered and unfortunately our main waiter tried to pour them over us at the table and managed to spill a decent amount on the table. No other drink orders were ever offered, besides the glass of water everyone gets. We didn't notice at the time because we were having a good group conversation so straight to the steaks.  Our 2 waiters were stuffy and didn't seem very interested in doing a good job. I assume it's because a large group already includes gratuity but it may be incompetence. My steak came out medium when ordered medium rare but was still delicious. Sadly the most inexperienced of the servers, the water girl, was by far the best and most attentive to us throughout the meal. 

The pre-steak bread and butter was plain and unimpressive. The sweet potato casserole was excellent, and the only side worth eating of the four we ordered. 

With so many viable steak options in Vegas I wouldn't eat here. 4 or 5 star prices require 4 or 5 star service and we ended up getting 1 to 2 star service from our main 2 waiters."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions. Every time it has been an amazing experience. The steaks melt in your mouth like butter. The side dishes are excellent. The last time I went was over the holidays last year and I had the pleasure of trying a bone-in filet for the first time. This was by far, hands down, the absolute best steak I have ever had. The clientele tend to be a bit pretentious, making for a somewhat stuffy atmosphere, but that is to be expected in Scottsdale I suppose. I never let it detract from the experience!"}
{"text":"Two stars are only for the view and the dessert. Not food. Food/pricing is more like 1 star. We went for our anniversary to celebrate and see what all the buzz is about. We only liked the view and the dessert. But honestly, you really do go for the steak! We were gravely disappointed. Our waiter was very nice but it's the steak that ruined it for us! First of all, everything is a la carte. We ordered 2 filets with a side of lobster Mac and cheese. My husband's filet was over done for medium rare and both steaks were bland! They did warn us that it only comes with butter and salt and pepper (encouraging guests to spend even more on toppings!) As if $60+ is not enough for one tasty filet? The steaks were charred and dry on the outside. Hence the melted butter! Honestly my husband said my filets seared on a hot iron skillet with appropriate seasonings are way better! I cook all our food myself and we rarely eat out. We rarely eat red meat as it IS a culprit of bad health. I was sad to know I cannot even take them to my dogs as we stayed in a hotel with no fridge. :( We couldn't finish our steaks and it was a huge waste of money. Not to mention, Harrah's made it hospitable with raw sewage smell as we exited the hotel the restaurant was located in. My God what an awful experience!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, Loved ,my salad.  Looking at the choices I decided wanted steak fed with grain, not corn and also figured I prefer Canadian steak over American most of the time and saving a few dollars doing it didn't hurt either.  So I ordered NY strip rather than Rib Eye which I would assume would be the corn feed American beef but I am not sure and would be what normally prefer in cuts of meat.  My friend ordered the Rib Eye and he had to send it back.  It was terrible, I think, as had small taste, easily the worst meat I have ever tasted.  He said it tasted to him like it was marinated in a urinal, I don't think it was that good even, it smelled like the other end imo.  They were super awesome and gave him another one and a large mashed potatoes and the Steak was marginally better but still easily worst I have ever had (I have had mystery meat in Cuba that I still to this day question what I actually ate).  Neither one of us have ever sent anything back, I would normally power through but couldn't even do that on small piece he hid on my plate so didn't realize we didn't eat much of the 2nd one either.  I am fairly sure it was how marinated as the steak was cooked awesome, just the smell and the taste only on the Rib Eye as my steak was 4 to 4.5 out of 5 NY Strip.  I for one will never eat, if given choice, beef that is feed corn, I just don't think that is right as not a normal part of their diet to the best of my knowledge and good beef is good beef so all in all if good don't care where the meat came from.  We have both ate at Ruth's  Chris before both here and in the States, I am at a lose to explain what happened and why?"}
{"text":"The problem with Ruth's Chris is that it's named \"Ruth's Chris\".  The name is synonymous with high priced, high quality steaks.  So saying that Ruth's is your favorite steakhouse is a bit like saying that Tiger Woods is your favorite golfer.  

But the simple fact is that their steaks are absolutely phenomenal.  \"Oh, but it's expensive and the menu isn't that great and their wine is overpriced, etc.\"
I agree.  But their steaks are phenomenal.  

I don't go to Ruth's Chris that often.  But when I do, I don't go for the wine, the side dishes, the ounce-to-dollar value ratio, the soup or the salad.  I go to have steak.  And I'm never disappointed.

I thought about penalizing Ruth's for one star because I personally prefer restaurants with a little more \"soul\" to them than Ruth's Chris can offer.  As a chain, it's just not able to deliver the kind of culture I enjoy.  But in the context that it's in, (a high priced chain of restaurants) it does a pretty amazing job of delivering such a high level of consistency.

So, I gave Ruth's Chris 5 stars.  Whether it's cool to say or not, my taste buds tell me that their steaks are worth every penny."}
{"text":"best steak I have had....... I ate at the one in OC after a long day at Disneyland and I cant wait to go back. Best steak i ever had"}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 stars...(I've decided to round up due to the excellent service)

Shrimp Orleans -excellent app had 5 shrimp in new orleans sauce with a side of mashed potatoes very tasty.

Thai Calamari- lightly breaded sweet and spicy sauce...also an excellent choice for app

Crab cakes: One order came with 2 so its great for sharing -It came on 2 sizziling hot plate with butter, I could have done without the butter which just made it heavy. The crab cake itself had a lot of crab, however it lacked flavour. I would pass on this next time.

Caesar Salad -pretty standard but did have a lot of parmesan cheese on it.

Tomatoe Bisque with bacon-on the salty and heavy side -would pass on this in the future

Petite Filet - this was cooked to a perfect medium, again I would have done it without the sizzling butter..

Creamed Spinch -I found this to have a lot of cream, would likely go for just steamed veggies next time

Mushroom side-nice accompaniment to the steak would order again

Chocolate Sin Cake -This was very rich..it was good for the first 3 bites...after which I really didn't want to eat any more.

Latte -Great to go with the extremely heavy cake"}
{"text":"pretty solid and consistent.   South Park location seem to have service a little tighter."}
{"text":"Steak was delicious if you are new to steak. However, an over-priced, sizzling steak that can be rivaled with a Milestone steak, with a plate that can give you 3rd degree burns is not worth it. Sorry Ruth Cris... i had high hopes."}
{"text":"Great service and top notch food.  We went to the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on a whim 30 minutes before closing time.  There were still several tables with customers in the restaurant.  I have dietary restrictions, so when the waiter came to the table I informed him of my restrictions and then I told him I wanted a full meal,  two appetizers, an entree and a dessert.  I asked him to choose.  He asked me how I liked my steak, rare, and how my husband liked his, medium.  I also asked him to pair a wine with each course (three) as I wasn't going to drive.   

The appetizers were a delight, and perfectly matched to a mellow mixed white.  We had the jumbo shrimp cocktail and a crab salad thing (I don't know the names as I didn't order them by name).  

The steaks were perfectly cooked to our preferences,  mine a bone-in lean fillet that was rare, near to blue, just the way I like it.  It was so tender it nearly melted in my mouth.  My husbands was a rib-eye that was just this side of medium, just the way he likes it.  These were paired with a side of asparagus, huge stalks but still tender and not stringy, as well as a simple creamy mashed potato.  The wine was a lovely Cabernet that had a perfect pairing with my steak.  It didn't go as well with the rib-eye (I stole a bite) but was an absolute match with the one I had.

Then it was time for dessert.  I stepped away from the table when the desserts came,  but there was a chocolate cake and a creme brulee.  I was meant to have the chocolate cake, but on double checking the ingredients it was discovered (as most chocolates do) to contain soy, so it was switched.  I have never previously had a creme brulee that I liked, but this was so delicate and smooth I had no difficulty finishing the robust portion I was given.  This was paired with a desert wine that would have gone well with the chocolate, but was too similar in flavor to the creme.  I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked how things were going, and he immediately brought back two different dessert wines for me to taste to find one to go with the dessert.  They were both quite good, but one was much more full flavored with the creme.

The waiter mentioned that he would make a note on my account so that in future I could order that particular wine the next time I have the creme brulee.  Now that is service. 

All in all I received exactly what I wanted.  The waiter, Ken, was attentive and there was never a time when I didn't feel like a special patron.  

I mentioned that I arrived at 30 minutes before closing.  We were there a good  2 hours at least and I never felt rushed or as though I was disturbing them, though I know that meant the chef was stuck in the kitchen too!
I would also like to mention that I was wearing a T-shirt, not dressed up in any way, unless you consider a chive-on shirt dressing up. This did not affect the manner in which I was treated at all.   The service was wonderful and I felt welcome and appreciated.  You can bet I will be back again and soon."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. We were celebrating Valentine's Day and buying a new home. Perfect choice!  We both had the calamari, which is prepared every bit as well as at The Capitol Grille. We had a lovely bottle of a German merlot with our petite filets. The filet was perhaps the best I'd ever had anywhere. Our waiter, Marvin, was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive--a cut above, in my opinion. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I had the occasion to go last night and although I have been going here for over 10 years, this is the first time I thought to write a yelp review for them.

The food is absolutely worth every penny and the side dishes were perfection as well.  I seem to always order more sides than needed but I still managed to eat everything."}
{"text":"Yes, definitely as good as it gets. I got a bunch of gift cards during their anniversary sale and have been pigging out at their delicious sirloin. 

I rate this one of the best steakhouse in GTA."}
{"text":"From beginning to end the service was AMAZING. The hostess, waitress and waiter made sure that my experience was perfect. 

It was my last day in Calgary and i wanted to have a really good broiled steak and everyone knows thats Ruth's Chris is always a good option. I came to the restaurant about 30 min from closing and was surprised to see how full it still was. The atmosphere was very quiet, classy and sophisticated and even though the restaurant was full it was nicely spread out so no one was too close to each other. I decided to have the Big Taste Menu which was a Crabtini, Filet, 1 side, and a desert and a different glass of wine with every dish for a decent price of $85. The Crabtini was a perfect appetizer with an amazing sauce and beautiful presentation. The filet steak comes on a 500F plate so it is still sizzling when it arrives at your table and it was cooked absolutely perfect. The desert was a chocolate cake and a creme with fresh berries and was a fantastic ending to my meal. The wines that accompanied the dishes were paired perfectly.

Overall my experience was very good and the whole meal came out to about $105 with everything, which in my opinion was not that bad. Notice i use the word perfect many times in my review ;)"}
{"text":"Nothing was Wooow us from the  Steak, crab cakes, calamari, veal ravioli and sauces. Not worth for $400 two of us and 8y daughter. Service wasn't  attentive or bad. We heard all the good thing but definitely not crafted cuisine or unique recipe. We are all agree Roka Akor the service, food and ambiance were very pleased us when we first visited. Again is just IMO."}
{"text":"We had never been to a Ruth's Chris steak house because there isn't one in our area.  We were thrilled that one opened in Harrah's in Las Vegas, as we stay there a few times a year.  I ordered the filet, and my BF ordered the ribeye.  My filet was the best I've ever had (and I've had a few in my day!)  The ribeye was such a disappointment.  fatty, and just not very good.  Our waitress asked how our dinners were, and we told her.  She commented that the ribeye was surprisingly below standard, compared to rest of their steaks.  It would have been nice to know that when we were ordering!  Still, the sides, and the sevice and the atmosphere were great and we'll go back"}
{"text":"will definitely be back. Our steaks were incredible as always, wife got the filet, I got the boneless ribeye. First time getting the ribeye, and next time I will stay with filet. The filet's at Ruth Chris are boarderline magical. Jeanie was our waitress, and she was wonderful. Her wine recommendation was top notch, suggesting the pinot noir \"Duckhorn.\" Alex assisted her and he did an awesome job as well. Overall, just a great, professionally-relaxed dining experience."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends came here expecting a high end holiday dinner. It was so disappointing. The waiting staff were wonderful, however the food was atrocious. Two of us ordered a green salad which was smeared in garlic. It tasted like the vegetables were soaked in garlic, drenched in garlic sauce with garlic sprinkled on top. We sent the salads back and I got a tomato and broccolini salad which came in huuuuge slices of tomato and entire broccolinis, so big I had no way of actually swallowing the food. Someone else got a soup where alcohol was supposed to be a compliment but the bisque tasted like wind with a hint of soup. Other people got meat dishes which was presented like a five dollar meal and tasted mediocre."}
{"text":"Service was poor. We arrived at 5:30 and we were seated in a room with one other table of people, right next to them. It was a large group of about 7 and we made it clear that we were celebrating our anniversary and wanted quiet and private dining. We were ignored. We were seated by an entrance and throughout the meal we had 2 bussers behind us in the hallway talking loudly in spanish without consideration to those around them. Our waiter was clearly unhappy, could not reccomend anything, had zero personality and did not offer any more that we asked for. The food was not great but not bad and there was nothing special on the menu. Nothing unique. When we left we were not impressed. We will probably not go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a favorite for my wife and I.  Its not cheap, but the food makes you forget about the price.  The stuffed chicken is out of this world, as is the sea bass.  My wife loves the filet!  The drinks are well made and the service has always been good.  The deserts are worth the carb overload.  If  you can get passed some snobby Scottsdale people complaining about how their Ferrari scrapped coming in to the parking lot at the table next to you, you will probably have a great experience."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!!!My husband and I  made dinner reservations at this particular Ruth's Chris to enjoy the Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Menu. Our first issue was the price, we have a tradition of traveling Thanksgiving week and we have dined at Ruth's Chris in various states and cities over the years. Over time the holiday meal price has changed varying from $36.95 to $39.95. However, never in our 6 years of this tradition have we ever paid $66 for our Thanksgiving Prix Fixe Dinner. Our server stated the charge was due to the fact this particular location is inside of the Harrah's Casino. It was Thanksgiving night and our anniversary so my wife and I went ahead ordered the meal since she really wanted Turkey. Second issue is when the food arrived, I immediately noticed that the meal looked vastly different to all the others we have had in the past. First the stuffing did not have sausage in it, in fact, it appeared to be plain toasted French bread slathered in cheap canned gravy. I tried to make the best of this $66 meal however, once I tried to put my fork into the stuffing, I discovered a rather large chunk of just plain dry bread. We immediately alerted our server who promptly apologized and offered to replace the meal. I declined with tears in my eyes stating its ok I am no longer hungry. At this point, I pretty much felt like dinner was ruined. When I told the server I cant believe Ruth's Chris would serve something like this and how the Thanksgiving meal has never been this bad at any of the other locations. Our server admitted the Thanksgiving meal had been prepared downstairs by the Harrah's cooks who work in their buffet kitchen and then brought upstairs to Ruth's. I was so upset to know that we had been duped into believing we were eating Ruth's quality dinner (especially for the price) only to find that it was the same meal being served in the Buffet. Of course I confirmed that the stuffing and mashed potatoes were all in fact the exact same. Our server was able to remove my meal from the bill however, seeing as how my husband ate his so we still had to pay $66, in my mind we still paid a hefty price to have cafeteria style dinner for one. My concern is if Ruth's allows for franchise purchasing they need to add specific guidelines to ensure the quality of the food being served under their namesake."}
{"text":"My wife and I had another great meal here. Service is great as usually and food quality is outstanding. Will definitely be coming back. 

Menu prices vary from $20-$50. This is a high end restaurant so the sticker price isn't a shocker."}
{"text":"As always Ruth's Chris never disappoints. Not even on Thanksgiving. Service and food are always five star! And the view of the strip by the window is pretty cool at this location. We come every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"FINALLY...I experienced the SIZZLE!!! At least that is their marketing phrase for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse! If you don't hear the sizzle, send it back! Came in on a quiet evening with my gf, and two other guest. The restaurant was not that busy at the time. Was greeted by a friendly server who recommended some drinks. My gf and I got the Pina Colada! It was good, but not the best I've had.

We got things started with the 'Special Appetizer Platter' which consists of: Seared Ahi Tuna with mustard sauce, Colossal Size Cocktail Shrimp with the cocktail sauce, Stuffed mushroom with crab meat and minced veggies, and their famous crab cakes! I gotta say that all the apps were great, but the price is a bit steep at $20 per person for the apps special. I would definitely rate the crab cake as the BEST I have had soooo far in Toronto! Pure meat and a bit of panko bread crumbs and mayo to hold it together with just a touch of lemon butter.

After that excitement, we ordered the Porterhouse for Two and it was cooked spot-on at medium rare-medium. The first time having this gigantic meat was quite a treat and interesting for myself and gf. Its basically a giant T-Bone but the meat tenderness of a filet and a ny strip...so that was kind of cool! The ny strip side was definitely quite tender and juicy from my experience, but either way its top notch meat of USDA Prime compared to other steak place that offer triple A meat. 

My two other guest ordered the Cowboy Steak 22OZ which is a bigger version of the ribeye but with bone-in. And the other ordered the 8OZ tender filet mignon...We ordered sides to compliment our dish with Lyonaise Potatoes with Onion, Sauteed Wild Mushroom Medley, and Grilled Asparagus! All top notch choices! And we finished all of it as well!!!

Desserts we all shared a bit of the apple crumbler (nice and hot dessert), chocolate sin cake (lots of choco), key-lime pie (nice and light taste), and cheese cake (has interesting nutty stuff in it)...

Overall the bill was a bit steep, but it was definitely the best place to go for top notch meat quality and the experience of the sizzle!

Go have a sizzle time at Ruth's Chris!!! We would highly recommend and also come back to enjoy again.

{"text":"This 5 star review is for our server Dorianne and her outstanding service. She went above and beyond to make this experience exceptional. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"To start, we had a caesar salad and onion soup. Both were delicious. Ruth's Caesar salad is the best I've tasted; even better than those made tableside. The broth of the onion soup was quite flavourful.

We ordered two small filets, cooked medium, and they arrived with melting pats of butter on top. The steaks were truly delicious. Sides were cooked perfectly: onion rings (huge), asparagus, and potatoes au gratin.

For dessert, we had creme brûlée, which was quite overpriced at $12.

Overall, the bill approached $220 with tip included. For a perfect dinner, it is hard to beat this place.

One complaint I have is that I saw a guy walk in wearing a t-shirt and jeans. The manager should have told him the rules about casual attire."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location Friday night reservation at 5. Traffic was heavy on Tyvola Road so we called ahead and told them we would be a few minutes late. Rachel said that would be fine. As soon as we entered we were seated immediately. Jonathan, our waiter, was very professional and accommodating. Thank you for the service and food was awesome! Steaks melting in our mouths! Thanks for making a memorable first visit to Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"Premium prices for mediocre steaks. They tried to convince me that medium well was medium rare. Sides were nuked until they were soggy, limpy and barely palatable. Our waiter kept sneaking up behind us to refill water - and from about a foot and a half above the glass. Water was splashing everywhere. The creme brûlée was the reason they got an extra star in this case."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Ruth Chris Steakhouse on 12/17/2010 and in a word - delicious!   Our server Madeline helped make the experience wonderful.  She was attentive, but not overbearing.
My husband had the 6oz filet and shrimp and the filet was exactly what everyone had told us it would be.  It was divine.
I chose the lambchop and it was huge and prepared perfectly (we had leftovers)
We started with the Calamari and we are use to receiving a dipping sauce at other restaurants, but this Calamari was made in it's own sauce and every bite sorta danced on your tongue from all the flavor.
My husband was equally impressed with the seafood chowder and the whipped butter and bread.
He had a southern comfort old fashion sweet and he said it was made just right.
Overall, a great dining experience.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The steaks are generally cooked a little bit less than what you request, so watch out for that. The service and food quality is outstanding."}
{"text":"Quality of food was above average however the service was less than enthusiastic compared to rival steakhouses such as Harbour 60 and Hy's. Price is also comparable to its competitors"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and very friendly staff.
Jennifer was our server and she went out of her way to ensure we had a great experience. 
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest:  I avoided this place for years because the name is just ridiculous.  It's hard to say.  It makes me sound lispy, and I just don't like it.  Now, my fairer half--who finds herself quite often having to talk sense into me when I'm too analytical and ridiculous (in this case, concerning a restaurant name)--is from New Orleans and explained to me the story of Chris' Steakhouse, and of Ruth's subsequent purchase of Chris' name, and thus the lispy-sounding restaurant that would become Ruth's Chris.  She also forced (or strongly encouraged) me to eat at Ruth's Chris to cure me of my aversion to eating here.  

I really don't crave steak often, but I enjoy eating one here when I do.  The asparagus is pretty damn tasty, and the stuffed mushroom caps are to die for.  And you could actually die if you eat too many of them.  My main reason for visiting Ruth's is to drink scotch with my lady (who, because she is awesome, also drinks scotch) and while away the afternoon, chatting with the friendly bartenders and gazing at each other through hazy, bloodshot eyes.  Mushroom caps and Macallan 18 are the way to a woman's heart, my friends.  Yes indeed."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food, service & restaurant itself !
Our server John was the best, he knew the dishes inside and out.
Cocktails were perfect !"}
{"text":"I love this steakhouse. I've been to quite a few in the Toronto area and Ruth's Chris is definitely one I keep coming back to. I usually get either the ribeye or the NY -- both awesome cuts and you can just taste the butter. When you see the steak sizzling on the hot plate -- it just makes your mouth water. However, there have been occasions when the steak isn't up to expectations but I would say 85% of the time it is!

The restaurant is never too loud which is good if you want a quiet meal and able to have conversation with your group. Service is always really good and they generally provide the right balance of being attentive and giving you your space."}
{"text":"We had such an impressive experience at another Ruth's location,so we decided to see if the Madison location would measure up. If DID!! The service was exceptional and the food perfect. The portions are huge and, yes, expensive but prepared perfectly and very suitable for sharing.  Our service team very carefully packaged our ample leftovers to give us a second meal at home tomorrow.  Just too much to eat!  We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Service was terrible with only one guy waiting on 3 tables. And the steaks were average at best with a lo tof fat content.The hot plate is a nice touch but can not carry the meal on it's own. Maybe just an off night but definately convinced me to move on with our choice for a steak dinner the next time"}
{"text":"My steak was overcooked and when I informed my server (Francisco), he was extremely rude about it. I'm sorry, but when I go to a restaurant I don't pay to be treated like dirt. Never again."}
{"text":"Highly overrated considering the price.  I took my wife there for her birthday two years ago on a whim. While the servers were courteous, the food was, to say the least, lacking lustre. The steaks we ordered were \"okay\" but very pricey (I've honestly had better at much cheaper places not considered as fine dining). Our side dishes (also overpriced) were bland at best. 

I will never set foot there again."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here we used a gift certificate so we ordered appetizers and sides and desserts, which we normally wouldn't have done based on their prices.  All are overpriced considering none of the ones we had were anything spectacular.  

But I would definitely keep going back for the filet.  Unbelievably good.  Believe the hype.  I'm not really a meat person and most steak tastes too gamey to me.  I usually need some sauteed mushrooms or onions or steak sauce or something to be able to finish a steak.  But their filet had such good flavor and was so tender I savored every (garnishless) bite.  Awesome."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for the last 10 years and they still manage to hit it out of the park! The filet is awesome and so is the saute spinach and potatoes! I love everything about this place from the atmosphere to the food! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris.....Abuse of brand! I was formally 
Greeted at the door which I loved. Our server's name was Christopher he was the best ...he was awesome but I was not at all impressed by the food.. the kitchen failed to realize the by serving a medium steak on a \"500 degree plate\" it's still cooking when you  plate it when you serve it even when I'm eating it by the 2nd bite of my steak was a well done and  flavorless... again i was not impressed 1st and last time here. Not at all worth  $54 more like $15."}
{"text":"Best steak I think I've ever had!! We had a private room for a wedding reception dinner. They did a great job with food, and service. I highly recommend their private dinning for special occasions."}
{"text":"Wonderful !!! The sea bass was amazing !!! The creamed spinach was delightful and the chocolate almond bark was delicious !!!"}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to dine at several Ruth's Chris steakhouses in different states over the years, this is one in Scottsdale is by far the best. Steaks perfectly done, sides to die for and staff at arms length at ready and willing to do anything to make your evening more enjoyable. If I still worked in AZ, I would be there tonight !"}
{"text":"The best steak. I chose the fillet minion. Came out sizzling, great atmosphere really good service here. Love this place. Wine is great. Calamari was really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for our anniversary. We were running late and called ahead to let them know. It was restaurant week, which is a busy time but the staff was still able to accommodate us and the service and meal was subuerb!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. It was my first time at RC. Service was good but not outstanding, our server sounded like he was rehearsing lines. 

The steaks themselves were top notch and sizzling hot - we both got the 16oz ribeye, Chicago medium. He got the blue cheese topping add on. Although I loved that my steak stayed warm the entire meal, the downside is that by the time I got to the end of it, it had over cooked itself from the heat. Went from being a medium to a well done! Next time will probably order it medium rare in order to offset that.

We started off the meal with the seared ahi tuna appetizer which was great. For our sides, we shared the shoestring fries and sautéed mushrooms which were underwhelming and way overpriced at $12 each! 

Dessert was the flourless chocolate sin cake for me and creme brûlée for him. Both exceptional.

Great place, however the price point is too high for this to be a regular spot. Special occasions only, if that."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype and certainly don't get the prices. One thing I do agree on is that the service was unfaultable and the venue is lovely. I didn't see the main room as we were a large family group in a private dining room, and we felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. We had a variety of apps, salads, mains, shared sides and desserts and nothing stands out in my memory. I had the filet and scallops, hubbie said he like my scallops at home better, steak was okay. Portions are huge, they should cut the portions and cut the price. Would I go again? Only if someone else was paying. To us it was a meal easily replicated at home which is not what we go out for. If you like well prepared familiar food in a lovely setting then yes. We were being hosted as my sister in law and husband dont like to cook but they do like to entertain and this is right up their alley. Very generous but wasted on us. There were fourteen of us with wine, can't imagine what the bill was."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a night out with my wife. Through living social I purchased a $50 gift card for $25. 
We made reservations for Saturday night for 6:30 and were seated right away. Our waitress was great, and took our order. We both had filets, hers was medium well and mine was medium. We also ordered garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.
The meal came and I saw that they butterflied my wife's filet, normally that is asked if ok first. I did not say anything and if it's good than fine, but it was one of the worst steaks from any restaurant. Never would I expect it from what I thought was a five star restaurant. My steak was good though. The garlic mashed potatoes were also bad, I mean truck stop quality. The asparagus was as bad, no flavor whatsoever. 
I don't know if it was because the living social deal or what. One thing is certain, we will never be back.
The two stars are because of the wait staff, they were great. The food would get a half star because while my steak was good, everything else was not.
When a meal costs $130.00 for two people, I expected so much better."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a business dinner... The staff is spectacular, the food is always delicious and if anything ever goes off track, the managers are some of the best I've seen at correcting it.  Thank you Suzanne for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"This new Ruth's Chris is amazing and beautiful.  They did a great job.  Why they ever put their old restaurants in such horrible places with no business before beats me.  The new restaurant is hug and you take an elevator to get there, fancy huh.  There are  plenty of tables right next to the window, and even if you are not sitting directly by a window there are great views from all spots in the restaurant.  

Since this place is so new the staff were EXTREMELY friendly so that people would say nice things.  Good job because it worked.  They brought the coolest light-up comment card holder to the table at the beginning.  The waiter knows the name of the host and calls you by your last name, which a lot of nice places do on the strip; very nice touch.  

As for the food, I had the filet which was amazing, you cannot go wrong with this choice.  It is a very generous size filet also, you will not go hungry with some small, tiny over priced steak, you get what you pay for here and its amazing.  I also had the lobster bisque which was alright, but there are plenty of great appetizers to choose from here.  I will upload some pictures later.  Also if your going to get desert get the cheesecake, it will blow any you have had before out of the water!

After coming back from the Ruth's Chris in Hawaii and knowing that they had two shabby restaurants before I was hesitant to make a reservation here, but I will definitely be back now after seeing such a great transformation.  Also I would like to thank Donald Bishop their General Manager for doing such a great job."}
{"text":"Okay, I will start by saying I'm typically not a fan of 3 hour dinners. That being said, I had no idea that much time went by. Service was so friendly and attentive. Salads were fresh, appetizers very tasty. Steak and seafood were both of very high quality. Extensive wine list and also enjoyed the dessert sampler. Warm and upscale but comfortable atmosphere. A very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"As usual the meal was great & the service matched up perfectly! Had the Petit Filet (medium) with broiled tomatoes...so yummy. For desert we had the berries & cream. They have definitely lived up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Update:  Unfortunately... the last two times we've come back, the food was just ok.  Definitely not $140.00 great.   We even went for their three plate combo for $40.00 / person, and the cupcake it came with, I only took 1 bite.  I didn't even see the chocolate explosion on the menu... very disappointing.  It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed...  and that hasn't happened."}
{"text":"My score is solely a reflection of the level of service we have received on several visits to Ruth's Chris - Madison.  I find their steaks to be excellent.  Mine have always been cooked perfectly to the requested temperature and well seasoned.  The sides and salads are great too.

I decided to finally write a review after having dinner there last night.  First off, it is restaurant week and they are particpating in it.  However, they place the menu for restaurant week at the very back of the menu where it would be easy to overlook it.  I find that to be borderline shady.  Next, when we told our server, Honey, that we would be dining off of the Restaurant Week menu she turned ice-cold.  It was obvious she was not happy - eye rolls, quick short sentences, and her ability to ignore us as she walked by.  Her attitude throughout the entire meal was poor.  Frankly, she had the personality of a small soap dish.  Finally, the pace of the meal was really rushed.  Appetizer, Steak with side dish, one drink/beer each plus a bottle of wine, and dessert - total time at the table?!?  ONE HOUR.  Our impression of the evening was that Ruth's Chris was trying to churn-and-burn all the Restaurnat week dinners.

The food last night was of the same high caliber we have had in the past.  We enjoyed it very much.

If a restaurant is going to participate in Restaurant Week they should, in my humble opinion, embrace it rather than discourage it.  If they really don't want the Restaurant Week dinners because meals are discounted, no problem, just don't participate.  Not a big deal.  Several of Madison's finest restaurants do not participate and I don't hold it against them.  

The lasting impression from Ruth's Chris - Madison is that they really didn't want us there last night.  OK - we will dine elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I took my wife and kids out on Christmas eve and it was ourfirst time there and wow the steak was juicy and cook to perfection. A little pricey but definitely worth it, I would still prefer the Keg steak house just because the pricing are good and still taste pretty good. Not a fan of the appetizers as they don't taste that good, would definitely come back again but only once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at RCSH all across the country.  Some are better than others.  This one is as good as it gets.  If you like RCSH, then this is what you will be accustomed to (big steaks, sizzling in butter, great sides & salads, etc).  A bit expensive, but if you're a fan then you know what to expect."}
{"text":"We made reservation for 5 at 6:00 PM and arrived a little early. Hostess greeted us politely and seated us immediately in a corner booth with a view. Todd our server greeted us and knew the name of our birthday guest. We order drinks and asked Todd for a appetizer recommendation. He suggested the crab stack which was delicious. We ordered petite fillets, cowboy ribeye and macaroni and cheese lobster. The sides where asparagus, Brussel sprouts and shoestring potatoes. Everything was excellent. Todd and his crew took excellent care of us and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Thank you Ruth's Chris for always providing great food and service!"}
{"text":"This Valentines me and my boyfriend came in without a reservation and were given great service. Very elegant, the servers where professional and fast. 
The menu is not apt for me, It is a steak house yes I know but you have to order and pay a separate price for sides. 30-50 for just the steak! Then you order your sides with is another 10-20 bucks. 
The wine was great selections.
The steaks come out in sizzling hot plates. Honestly we had to take the steak out of the hot plate and put it in another because it was sizzling and splatting grease. To hot to eat. 
The bathroom, was smelly like an out house, and did not match the dining area. It was great other than that."}
{"text":"We made reservations at Ruth's Chris Steak House over a year ago for Valentine's day 2015.  We had high expectations for a wonderful evening.  Unfortunately, the service was lacking, and our server Joey spent much of his time ignoring us.  It was interesting that a couple of his male friends were seated at a table next to us, and he spent time visiting and catching up with them repeatedly.  Joey would pass by us and wait on the table on the other side of us never acknowledging us, even when it was apparent we had finished eating. We even had to ask for a dessert menu.  

We had no problems with the food.  It was served hot and was delicious, but when I go to a high end restaurant, I am not paying for just the food but the service.  We spent close to two hours there, and too much time waiting.  I realize it was a busy night, but they didn't seem to be anymore busy than many evenings as there were several open tables nearby.  

Joey received a tip commensurate with the service we received.   In the future we will stick to eating in the bar.  

As for YELP, shame on you for the disclaimer to use care in reviewing restaurants as they cannot remove negative reviews.  This review was justified.  If you don't want honest reviews posted then you shouldn't have this site!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time.  Last weekend I was in Las Vegas and I finally did. This is a beautiful restaurant and with our window seat it was great for eating and people watching.  We were seated right away but it took a little while for our server to take our order.  I had the rib eye steak and my son had the lamb chops, both were great, generous portions.  I understand finishing the steak with butter but this was too much (a bit greasy) for my taste.  We shared the wedge salad, a baked potato and the broccoli au gratin.  

Dinner was a bit pricey but occasionally I guess it's okay.  Small problem with the salad course. The server was very attentive and later \"comped\" us a dessert, the chocolate expresso cheesecake - yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 4 times now, and it has not disappointed.

Service was impeccable, and the food phenomenal.  

To really enjoy yourself here, you must not think of the bill.  I'm serious.  If you plan to come here, know that you will be spending some dough.

USDA prime beef lives up to its golden standards.  It was like melting butter in your mouth.

The side dishes were enormous and were served al la carte. You don't see that enough in restaurants anymore. The desserts were suppose to be made in house and they must have been because the creme brule was the best I've tasted....ever!

The service was fast and elegant with just the right touch of personality. The waiter had a knowledge in wine that really made for a great experience. He was on the ball all night and did not miss a beat. 

It was really nice to have that type of service. You don't get that as much now.

One of the management stopped by to see how we were doing. I found this very above and beyond because we didn't complain about anything and that is usually when a manager comes by to see you. They were all class.

I recommend to anyone who is looking for a wonderful dining experience to try out Ruth's Chris Mississauga. If you have never heard of Ruth's Chris Steak House before you are missing out and you must make your next evening out with them.

It was a real pleasure from beginning to end."}
{"text":"I don't know whether my taste has gotten more demanding or Ruth's Chris has declined. My husband and I went recently, the first time in at least 5 years. While the ribeye and filet mignon were good, they weren't great. And both were drowned in salt - his with grease (butter?) and mine with the Au Poivre sauce. Yuck! Also, my \"medium rare\" ribeye was slightly overdone, pretty disappointing for a steakhouse. His tempura onion rings were laden with grease and yes, more salt. My spinach au gratin was divine, although probably salt-laden too, just less noticeable. The calamari appetizer was excellent and so were the cheesecake and bread pudding desserts. But for $240 (including 1 glass of wine each), we could have had a far better meal in many other places in Scottsdale or Phoenix. It will be a whole lot longer than 5 years before we go again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been telling me about this place for a while and it's nothing less then unbelievable fantastic service excellent view of Las Vegas Blvd and the most amazing ribeye ever!!! It's served on a 500 hundred degree plate!! Anything served like that is the way to go!! don't settle for less go Ribeye (spoil yourself it's Vegas baby!!)"}
{"text":"so so.... They use Sysco meats for their Filet... 12.95lb so a six ounce at cost is less than 6 bucks to them ... They sell it for 30bucks plus.-al la cart!.. You can go to Knoches Meat market and get a Filet that is even more  cut -with- a -fork tender and grill it yourself... Throw some char-grilled asparagus down and butter it up,- All under 15 bucks! Hummm... U decide...."}
{"text":"The filet was yummy ! The Cesar salad and spicy shrimp was amazing as well. They have a patio outside to sit and the views are great!"}
{"text":"First time ever coming and it was great!  All the servers were super nice and they knew everything on the menu by heart (at least the ones I had).  They made sure everything was done well and wow top service for sure!  The food was a little tough (it could have been what I ordered but other than that it was amazing!  Go and enjoy but just make sure you bring lots of money because it is expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Normally, Ruth's Chris is fantastic, we go a few times a year. That being said, tonight, not so much.  Its my wife's birthday and its restaurant week, so why not get a great meal for a good price. Wrong answer... 

It appears they serve cheaper grades of meat for restaurant week hoping the rubes wont know the difference. We both ordered the rib-eyes on the Kings Feast, both our steaks were not so tender and not so juicy. We both agreed they were cheaper cuts of meat and could have gotten better steaks at an Outback. Also, the mushrooms weren't cooked long enough and the cheese cake deserts were dry.  The whole meal was second rate, all the way around disappointing, not what I expect from RC. I thought the whole point of restaurant week was to show case what the restaurant has to offer at a reasonable price, hoping you will come back another day. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe its just turned into a money grab. Oh well, $240 down the shitter... Wont be doing that again...

I would say this to RC... If you are not going to bring your A Game for Restaurant Week, then don't participate, all you are doing is tarnishing your reputation and disappointing potential customers."}
{"text":"Went here recently .. And we weren't dressed up (because we had something come up that put us in a time crunch to go back to the hotel to get dressed up before the time of our reservation) -- so we went casual and boy, were we disappointed.

Apparently, if you aren't dressed up, you deserve mediocre service. We were given looks from servers and our order wasn't taken until about 26 minutes after being seated (we were ready to leave after 30).

Food was mediocre.  Want a better steak?  Go to Delmonicos or Flemings. What made it taste worse was the level of ignorance that came with the lack of customer service.  Once our food came out, we weren't checked on once by any of the servers.

We definitely won't be back. Thanks for being a bunch of jerks!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Date with mom at Ruth's Chris for Mother's Day!

This is our first visit to this Ruth's location. Reservation at 6:15pm and the place was about 80% filled when we arrived(not the patio). Wow, must be good! I had the Ruth's Classic dinner (House Salad, 6 oz Filet and Shrimp with a side of Mashed Potatoes; Chocolate Cake with Fresh Berries for dessert), and for $39.95! Definitely worth it! Mom just wanted the 8oz Petite Filet. The meat was really juicy, tender and flavorful, you really get what you paid for. The manager Tim came to check on us a few times which we thought it was really nice.

The dessert gave us a very sweet and pleasant ending. Can't wait for another visit!"}
{"text":"Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there?

This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.

It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. 

I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. 

The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. 

Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. \"Hold the butter.\" May save you some pain."}
{"text":"Another great franchise steakhouse, always great place for dinner...had their filet mignon and shrimp cocktail.  Great atmosphere, casual to nice attire."}
{"text":"My experience with Ruth Chris of Uptown was Awesome
My waiter was named Alex. He was awesome. He made sure our drinks and bread was filled at all times
I chose the 10oz  salmon and stuffed shrimp oh my goodness it was awesome I got full half way through. but I finished it I also has the mashed potatoes. I wish I wish I wish i knew how to make those at home. I also ordered a Rosemary raspberry martini awesome drunk it dry! Lol love loved it I will
Be back service was awesome I do recommend it is pricey but the service and food is awesome. Our bill together was 126.00"}
{"text":"Being a native I've had the pleasure of eating at steak houses all over the state but had never visited Ruth's Chris. Was there friday night and ordered the steak special for the evening which was the bone in filet...it was amazing, my boyfried got the petite I think, which as good but not as good as mine. Our server was very polite and helpful and friendly. We ordered the crab cakes for our appetizer, which were bland. I'm a purist when it comes to crabcakes...the more lumps of pure crab the better and the simpler the better, these had other ingredients I find unnecessary, but still surprisingly  stayed bland. We also ordered the scalloped potatoes which were cut too thick thus not allowing to become tender all the way through and still raw in the middle. We told our server not askiing to speak to the manager, but she came over anyway. You could tell from the get go she was put out and annoyed at our dislike for the potatoes and bothering her even though we were very polite and didn't ask for them to be removed from the bill even, and we knew it would go in one ear and out the other as they often do in finer restaurants, but oh well. And for this reason, I won't return. I went for a fabulous steak which i did get but the whole package is the sum of it's parts, and all the parts weren't up to par"}
{"text":"Sunday, November 23. Went to Ruth's Chris Steak House for my Mother's birthday. She had been looking forward ordering the lobster tail. Cocktails and appetizers (Carpaccio and Calamari) everything was good. When dinner arrived the lobster tail was three tiny bites, two if your a big eater! I am aware that the menu is very pricey, the restaurant is very upscale dining, and I have no qualms paying. However $68.00 for a lobster tail that would not even be large enough for an appetizer for one person! Shame on you Ruth's Chris Steak House, and your Chef as well. A good waiter would have informed us that the lobster tail was a micro meal and made another recommendation. Now here's the kicker. My brother ordered the special, \"The Filet and TWO Twin Tails\", $48.95. The Filet was 4-6-oz (?) and the Lobster Tails were the same tiny size as my Mothers. My brother's dinner was nice for a reasonable price, but Mother left hungry and very disappointed. Dinner for 4 people, $383.65 not including the tip.
In all fairness, we had recently dined at Ruth's Chris Steak House. Maybe 5-6 weeks ago. Francisco Torres was our server. We requested him again, however he was not scheduled until later that evening. He gave us excellent service, wonderful menu and wine suggestions. The meal that night was wonderful. We were looking forward to coming back. After this last disappointing experience I am having regrets."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse I have ever been to!!!! Awsome service make you feel like an Army of staff is serving you.  Shrimp DeJonghe is the BOMB. Steak always cooked to perfection and flavor."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton. Became hungry, went downstairs, sat down at the Ruth Chris bar to eat a bite. 

\"We don't have a bar menu\". I see.

The full menu does not include anyting that I would consider real food. Not even a burger, or steak frites, or whatever. Instead, basically, steak only. Yeah... but this is a steakhouse, so, they have steaks, right? 

But....

The filet steak was 54 CAD plus tax, that makes for approximately 60 (!!!) for the steak alone. Sides are all extra. 

No don't get me wrong, the sizzle and everyting was there, the butter, the quality, too.

The shoestring fries were difficult to eat with a fork. Haha. 

The same steak costs 42 (tax included) at my local Ruth Chris's in Ft Lauderdale. 

I was hoping for a bar menu with more reasonbable offerings, quick and fresh. After all, I was not even sitting down on a table, nor did I linger... Just wanted a quick bite that turned into a 100 dollar affair (with wine). 

Too expensive, sorry. Three stars."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome. Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet. If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it."}
{"text":"I went to this steakhouse and had the fish - and it was fabulous. Yes, the Market Fresh Seafood Selection for that night was just great, if I recall it was a crusted white fish, can't remember the details, just that it was yummy. From all accounts around the table the steak was pretty awesome too. The flourless chocolate cake that arrived for dessert was amazing - more of that please."}
{"text":"We were here the second week in July.   Had reservations and called to say we'd be late by 20 minutes.   However, we were greeted with a \"why are you late\" as opposed to \"welcome\".   Both of us were wearing classic evening wear so it was obvious we weren't bums.  There was plenty of room so they could easily handle the change.  The service was horrible.  The waiter had no desire to wait on us.  Then the food.  The only thing that was cooked properly was the filet.   My lamb chops were all fat and literally thrown on the plate.  No presentation to be found on either plate.   The side potatoes au gratin weren't cook.  Crunchy potatoes!  Yum!  The creamed spinach was laden with red pepper.  Hello?   What a waste of our time and money.  One star given for the view of the scantily-clad girls in front of Harrahs.  At least we had entertainment."}
{"text":"Splurged on Ruth's Chris for our anniversary. Tonight was probably the worst value for money we've ever gotten at a restaurant. Food was not remotely fine dining. Steak was gristly. And swimming in melted butter. Could have enjoyed excellent food from a great chef for what we paid. Instead realized we cook every dish we had better at home."}
{"text":"This is my third time to Ruth's Chris and first to this location.  Upon arrival it was 'complimentary' valet (more on this later).  Personally I think valet parking is stupid unless the lot is miles away.  We started with a bottle of Shiraz- it was very good.  I had the surf and turf special and my coworker had the petite filet.  I ordered mine medium and it came out rare- not cool.  After coming back from the kitchen the meal was good and hopefully spit free.  We had the broccoli and mashed potatoes as sides.  The broccoli wasn't done enough and very hard to cut through with any grace.  The service was alright until I arrived in the parking lot.  As I'm handing the lot attendant a tip, he says to me \"hey you might want to turn your music back on, i got bored listening to it because it was country and switched it to howard stern\".  If the place wasn't so expensive I would have given it two stars.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris! The service and food are just amazing.

I was seated at the bar, and the girl behind it was not only friendly (but not overly friendly), she even gave me tips on what to try drinks-wise and food-wise, and was correct.

The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection, and the butter seasoning was just divine. I ordered the mac and cheese as a side dish, and was not disappointed. The perfect Southern comfort food.

It is on the pricey side ($80 + tip for a small steak, half order of mac and cheese and three drinks), so I probably wouldn't go unless it was a special occasion or someone else was paying. However, given the quality of the food, it wasn't overpriced."}
{"text":"Three strikes Middleton Ruths Chris; this was our last visit.  
Just not worth the $$. (For two people, we spent $250 without desert or salad)

Summary:  Middleton Ruth's Chris food is excellent, no question.  However, if you are looking for a fine dining  experience don't go here.     For a great steak and five star service at the same price head to either Johny Delmonico's, Delaney's, or the Tornado Club; you won't be disappointed.   

Review: 
We've eaten here three times now and each experience has been the same:  Food good, the rest of the experience is meh. 

You have to ask to have your coat checked, they don't offer so most folks carry their coats around and drape them everywhere.  The result is coats everywhere making the dining room look shabby.  Small thing I know.  But they do have a coat check room, how hard is it to staff it?

Last night I had to ask the bar tender  five times (no joke) for the wine list.  He kept handing me the drink specials list.   I finally asked the other bartender for the wine list so we could share a bottle. Hmmm, that was weird.

Another small thing but there are several TV's at the bar.  Are they trying to be a sports bar or a fine restaurant?  It kind of detracts from the \"fine dining\" experience.  Who are they catering to?

Last night we were seated 20 minutes past our reservation and saw our waitress 3 times; 1-hand us our menus and explain specials, 2 take our order, 3-give us our check.  

Half of the customers were dressed up and other half  were dressed in sweatshirts and jeans.  You can't really hold that against the restaurant, but it does detract a little from your experience.  My wife and I were dressed  up  (me in tie and jacket and wife in dress) so clearly were were out for a fine dining experience, but the hostess, bartender, and waitress all treated us as if we were in jeans and a tee shirt."}
{"text":"FOOD IS SOOO YUMMY! The service was sub par but the food made up for it! We had the broccoli au gratin and wow, it was soo tasty. Lots of cheese sauce that made the broccoli taste soo good! I had the Skewer salad and it was good. My husband had the T-Bone steak and it was soo delicious. Seasoned perfectly. The filet piece was like butter, it was really really good. The asparagus and hollandaise sauce was ok. Nothing wrong with it, just had no wow factor. I will definitely come back here. I have to try their filets. I bet they are amazing."}
{"text":"So who wouldn't love a yummy piece of beef swimming in melted butter on a 500 degree plate?

C'mon it is so flippin delicious I don't know what to do with myself!!!!  

My fav is the filet, med or med-rare...depending on my mood. My bf likes- no scratch that - LOVES the cowboy rib-eye! He is your typical, hard to please Texan when it comes to beef and admitted it is \"the best steak he has even had.\" So there you have it. Top grade meat and over-priced wine and you have a winner.

Give the creme brulee a try. I, myself am not a huge fan of creme brulee but Ruth's Chris makes one to crave."}
{"text":"Even though I am not a big steak guy, I love this place. They get everything right, everything. Most times, my wife and I sit at the bar or one of the great booths right off the bar and have drinks and some food. 

The wine list is STUPID GOOD. And unlike many \"steak\" places, they actually have red wines other than just Cab Sav! 

The food is fantastic and the service is superb. Kevin at the bar is a pro - and ask for Young for your server if you are eating dinner - she rocks. 

The only negative is the price - it is a bit silly how much the food costs here. It would get 5 stars but for the prices."}
{"text":"The Ruth's Chris in Vegas is a good solid restaurant, but with so many steak options in Vegas, I can understand why people would pass it up for a more glamorous Vegas style dining experience.  It gets lost among the glitzy upscale restaurants, but then again, they have Ruth's Chris across the nation and some folks go to Vegas to experience things unique to Sin City.  Although the dining experience is a bit sterile, you will walk out satisfied and ready to take on more of Vegas.  

Pros:
Good food
Efficient service and staff

Cons:
Sterile and lacks character - not Vegas like

I like Ruth's Chris for the same reason I like other chain restaurants - familiarity and a fairly consistent dining experience.  The food is good and of high quality, and you will hardly ever walk out hungry or disappointed.  There are tons of steak restaurants in Vegas, ranging from \"super cheap\" to \"you've got to be kidding me\" expensive, so do your research and compare options before dropping upwards of $50+ per person without drinks or appetizers.      

In most cities, a Ruth's Chris would be considered a \"fancy\" or near \"top tier\" dining experience, but unfortunately in Vegas, it's just another restaurant.  I like that it's quieter than a Strip restaurant and with most of the pretentious folks eating at more \"upscale\" establishments, you can bet that the restaurant will be less crowded and the atmosphere more relaxed - you would hardly know that you were eating in Las Vegas.  

The service at this location is pretty consistent with the other locations - efficient and professional, though distant.  I think the servers at Ruth's Chris do a wonderful job: they take your order and come around to check on you, but don't expect a lot of personality from the wait staff or the restaurant.  It's a great place to eat good food, but it's not necessarily a place you go to be wowed...unless you're wowed by a beautiful cut of filet sizzling on the hot plate.  Don't get me wrong, this is a nice place to eat unless you're absolutely expecting to be blown away (Vegas style) by the experience.  By the way, our wait person didn't inform us of the specials they were running.  It's no biggie, but I could've saved $20-30.

Ruth's Chris in Vegas might not deliver on style and may not be one of the \"hot\" places to eat, but you can always rely on a good meal comparable to most steak restaurants in Vegas.  It is one of my favorite places to get a filet, but in Vegas, the competition is just too stiff for an outright recommendation. 

I'm giving it 3 stars on Yelp though it deserves 3.5 stars:
4 stars for the food but the overall experience only earned 3 stars because of the numerous options in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very expensive but very good and the service was great. The shrimp appetizer was amazing and I 100% recommend the banana cream pie for dessert--so delicious"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris had always been one of my favorite chain steak houses.   I love my filet mignons rare, and RC has always delivered.

Imagine my surprise when on this visit, my rare filet looked like a medium-to-well-done and my girlfriend's medium-rare only had a hint of pink in the center.

Now, I am not such a food snob to send things back to the kitchen, but this time the disparity between what was ordered and delivered was too much.

Within 5 minutes, the kitchen came back with a perfectly cooked rare steak.  Not only that, both the manager and the head chef (Craig) came to serve it themselves!  What personal service!

Now, many places serve a rare steak that's cold in the center.  Chef Craig calls this a \"black-and-blue\" steak.  The steak I received was the most perfectly cooked rare I have ever received: seared on the outside, pink on the edges and warm but red in the center.

Mistakes happen.  I believe the GREAT restaurants reveal themselves in how they resolve these situations.

(Also, I feel Steven's review is a bit harsh : Ruth's Chris's trademark is the buttery steak on a sizzling hot plate.  Kobe beef, which is by definition a fattier cut, may not work well for this.  The leaner filet is the cut of choice here.)"}
{"text":"The ladies and I decided to spend the first day of Summerliscious at the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for a fun Girls Night Out. I reserved online in advanced but upon walking into a near empty restaurant, the hostess denied our polite request to sit in a booth. Be sure to request this in advance, if this is your preference.

We had many servers attend to us but Qais was our favourite. He was extremely pleasant and made us feel welcomed.

I selected the following from the Summerliscious menu:

* The Tomato & Basil Bisque 
* 6oz Petit Filet - medium well 
* Shared Sides (Creamed Spinach, Mashed Potatoes & Mushrooms)
* Chocolate Sin Cake

The Bisque was a delicious creamy base with great chunks of bacon and the favourite part of my meal. The sides were tasty and good enough to share in our party of 3. I was anxious to bite into a melt in your mouth steak, but was sadly disappointed with the taste and the flavour. My friend who had her steak prepared medium, shared similar sentiments. I had a taste of the chicken which was actually quite good. The large slice of chocolate sin cake slice was nice & rich and too big for me to finish.

Despite a couple of good bites, I've had better tasting steaks and experiences elsewhere. As such, I have no interest in returning back to Ruth Chris' Steakhouse to eat. If you decide to go, opt for the chicken or salmon and definetly try the tomato bisque soup!"}
{"text":"We visit every summer and Winterlicious.  The steak is as good as they say it is (if not better).  This is one restaurant I'm not worried about raving to others about as I know everyone else will enjoy it just as much."}
{"text":"I don't want to spend another $60 here... Admittedly the steak was decent, but they forgot about our reservation and it was a horrible waiting before we could actually sit down......better service is expected if they're charging this much."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Ruth's on Sunday, August 2nd with a party of 5, four adults and one child. Our waiter was very polite but four of our steaks were not prepared properly. The waiter did check back with us as we each realized our steaks weren't prepared as ordered. At this point it is difficult as all four were over-done. If they were a bit under-done they could be put back on for a few minutes, however all four were over cooked. With one of us with the correct order and the side orders being shared, we all kept our meals as we didn't want to make a huge issue. It was my 80 year old mother's treat for the birthday celebration and not worth making a big deal over, waiting another 10-15 minutes while they were re-made and having her feel bad. Pretty unforgivable and disappointing having four steaks out of five over-cooked.  : ("}
{"text":"I have three letters to describe this place. O. M. G.  =)

Four of us went to this restaurant as part of a birthday celebration and it is pretty much the best steak I have ever had in my life.  

When you're seated at your table, they start you off with some garlic toast and cheese toast which was delicious.  Our waiter was phenomenal, he advised us that some of the appetizer portions were quite big and wanted to make sure that we didn't fill ourselves up so much that we wouldn't enjoy our steaks.  I highly recommend the crab cakes to share.  It melts in your mouth and tastes incredible.

My partner and I shared a porterhouse steak (which uncooked comes in at a whooping 44 oz!).  Our friends ordered a filet and a ribeye each.  The steaks were amazing.  They are served on a hot plate with liquid butter and you can hear the butter sizzling when the plates are brought to your table.  I have never had a perfectly cooked medium rare steak until I ate here.

For the birthday girl, a slice of chocolate sin cake with a candle was brought to the table courtesy of the restaurant.  The rest of us shared a portion of bread pudding with whisky sauce for dessert.  Light and amazingly good!

The ambience and decor was really nice.  Low lighting with some booths by the walls and tables by the windows.  Tasteful and classic furniture.  I was very impressed by the waiters' service, not just the gentleman who served our table but all of them whom I can hear serving the tables around us.  

The prices are higher than a normal steak house but definitely worth it!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and it's always a superb meal. Great ambiance and service is always on point. We like to take our friends here when we want to have an amazing dinner and a night on the town! Keep up the amazing work!!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary.  We sat in the lounge, as the appetizers were half off.  The waiter was new and didn't seem to know the complete menu. 

We had the shrimp cocktail. Had two orders.  Well, we had one at first.  Then my wife, who ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms returned them as they were mostly stuffing and not very tasty.  The waitress said she would take if off the bill, but didn't.  My wife ordered another shrimp cocktail and claimed that with the bread it was enough for her meal.  She didn't order an entree.  She had two gin and tonics and said they were very good.  So, since she had all appetizers it was much cheaper.  Only $9.50 for four nice sized shrimp and sauce.  She even ate the delicious salad under the shrimp!

I had the 6 oz. Filet and Shrimp at $53.95!  The fillet was delicious if not small.  They shrimp were much smaller than the cocktail shrimp and over cooked.  I should have sent them back, as they didn't look professionally prepared.  I also got mashed potatoes with garlic.  The potatoes wet bland and there wasn't much garlic.  The butter was excellent.  Overall I wouldn't buy this meal again.  

We got a desert with my meal.  My wife didn't get the presentation.  I just tried it.  The whip cream was good!  The strawberries were tasteless, they should be buying better.  I didn't eat much of it.  It was pretty but boring.  I would have liked something with chocolate on it but there wasn't any choice.  The dessert also had chocolate truffles with it.  Four I think.  Nothing to get excited about there.

The restaurant was fairly clean, with the exception of the filth in our booth.  I accidentally stuck my hand between the cushion of the booth.  Hmm.  I also noticed that the laminate wall behind us was wiped down, but streaked and unprofessionally cleaned.  The bathroom were very nice and clean.

The total bill was $100 with a $15 tip, after the manger removed the mushroom appetizer that the waitress didn't.  Check your bill as everything is over priced as it is, in my opinion.

Lastly, we won't be going back. There are better steak houses in Madison, in our opinion."}
{"text":"Had the 12 oz ribeye with crab rice and steakhouse salad all was delicious well prepared."}
{"text":"Service good,great location & good atmosphere.
Wine list good,Had California cab..was properly decanted,
Knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary last night with dinner at Ruth Chris, uptown Charlotte, NC.  We usually eat there a couple of times a year for special occasions.  

This was the first weekend of the Queen's Feast/restaurant week so they were understandibly busy, but we were seated shortly after our reservation time.  Service was excellent (Jane) and things were fine until our steaks (both filets ordered medium) arrived.  They were undercooked.  

While waiting to get our server's attention (she had a tray of food for another table) another RC employee (non server) noticed us and came over to see if there was an issue.  She arranged for our steaks to be sent back.  We ate some of our sides while we were waiting (we were hungry; we hadn't eaten much that day in anticipation of this meal), but when our steaks came back out, they refreshed our sides with hot offerings without us even having to ask.

Our server was apologetic and gave us a good tip on how to order next time as their written descriptions of doneness doesn't really jive with what the kitchen  sends out.  

The GM came by as well to apologize and to check to see if we were now pleased.  And while we didn't ask for any concessions, when the bill came they did right by us.

While we were waiting for the steaks to come back out my husband and I discussed going to a different steakhouse the next time.  However because they handled this situation so professionally and they were so customer focused, we won't be going anywhere else.

The food is excellent, the service is great, and the portions are substantial.  My honest ranking would be 4.75, not a perfect 5  just because the steaks were initially undercooked.  However I highly recommend this location of this storied restaurant franchise."}
{"text":"Visited Ruth's Chris this past Friday night.  I had some family coming into town for the weekend and wanted to have a nice dinner while they were here.  Ruth's Chris did not dissapoint.  Everythingn was truly perfect.  The food was really good.  Michael, our waiter, was simply great and very attentive.  I had my two little girls with me that night and they went above and beyond in accomodating them and even gave them toy cows and crayons to play with.  The steaks were fantastic!!  We had 5 adults and 2 children and we ordered 2 filets, 1 Salmon entree, 1 Cowboy Steak and one 3-course meal that included a filet topped with shrimp.  We didn't do much drinking.  We only had the filtered water and one glass of wine.  Then we had 3 desserts and 2 coffees.  I was expecting a total bill of $500+ easy, but it came in at around $340, so I was pleasantly surprised.  We really had a nice time and will be back again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was not.

My partner and I ordered the ribeye's with sweet potato casserole and a baked potato. The steak was very bland and over cooked. The sides weren't anything special either. 

Overall, if you want a $200 dinner for two, I recommend going to Barberian's or another local non-chain steakhouse where you'll at least get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Expensive Yes! But worth it. The food was delicious, and plentiful. The service was just right, the waiter seemed to know exactly when to come over and when to stay away. The parking is difficult to find, but |I can understand their choice of location since this is a chain that for the most part caters to wealthy travellers. Dinner for the two of us with tip ran $280. We'll save this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones... This was NOT a Yabba Dabba Doo Time.  We came as a large party to celebrate a 60th birthday and was not impressed at all.  The dino sized sides were under-seasoned and bland.  The 2 inch thick onion rings were soggy and soft, they were served with a watered down unknown sauce that had no business being there.  The \"sauteed\" mushrooms were not only whole mushrooms, but were not so much \"sauteed\" as they were swimming in a pool of unseasoned butter.  The green beans were on steroids.  They were about an inch in diameter and also, yes you guessed it, under-seasoned.  To get to the heart of the restaurant, the filet was ordered medium and was rare on one side and well on the other.  In other words, it was inedible.  It doesn't stop there.  The waiter, while clearly stepping on my foot, as I told him, he spills water all over the table and on me, then walks away.  Assuming he is getting something to clean it up, he comes back empty handed.  When I ask him for some napkins, he rudely tells me, \"Just a minute, ma'am, I am grabbing napkins now.\"  The most aweful experience ever."}
{"text":"All I can is... YUMMY!

The hubs and I ate here last night and it was amazing.  The service was impeccable from the door.  Our waiter was Francisco.  He was very knowledgeable and friendly.  We started off with a couple glasses of Moscato (yes, a dessert wine but I love it anytime!).  The bread and butter was very delish.  We ordered the tempura onion rings for an appetizer... I thought they were okay.  The onion and batter were too thick for my liking but the hubs enjoyed them.  I ordered the filet w/ 6 shrimp and a side of potatoes au gratin.  Hubs ordered the BBQ shrimp and the fries.  My food was AMAZING... the steak came out sizzling and was melt in your mouth yummy as were the potatoes.  I LOVE those potatoes.  The hubs raved about his BBQ shrimp.  For dessert we had the chocolate molten cake.  AND THAT WAS GREAT!  It was a huge piece of cake with vanilla ice cream on top, drizzled with caramel.  

All in all... a FANTASTIC meal!  We left with full bellies and some leftover for later.  I'm a fan and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my food very much, but was very disappointed with the service.  Cups sat empty for long periods of time. The staff was incredible rude, by dropping plates on our table instead of placing them. Even with boxing up our food,  the staffs demeanor wasn't pleasant, almost like he didn't want to be working that night.  I have been to other Ruth Chris's around the counrty and had great experiences and unfortunately this was not one of them. Again, the food was good, but the service could have been much better. At a restaurant like this I expect a little more with service."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, but here's what I remember.

Pros- 
Best melt in your mouth steak ever
Really good salad with minced olives and onions in the dressing
Delicious crab-stuffed mushrooms

Cons-
Cold, uncomfortable atmosphere (snooty)
Bread was never very good
Everything had to be ordered a la carte
Very pricey"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this location and everyone from the valet attendants to the wait staff made me feel like a special quest and \"Queen\" for the night.

I got the filet with twin lobster tails ($47.95) and it was succulent but the broccoli was extremely plain with no flavor at all ($8).  The presentation of the chopped salad was exquisite, unlike any I've seen - not in a bowl but created in some sort of round cylinder to create a perfectly stacked look ($9).

Although dinner was memorable I think the majority of the menu is grossly overpriced and the broccoli needed flavor and flair.  In my opinion I can't see paying $150 for 2 salads, 2 entrees and 2 side items (no dessert!) when my meals are just as tasty at Longhorn or Outback without all the foo foo.  A nice treat when someone else is paying because I'm much too conservative!"}
{"text":"Expensive, steaks were NY style, one exception I had was that when you pay $300 for dinner and the establishment requires you to dress in a certain style. It should be adhered too! No shorts or tee shirts like the guy sitting next to me. I am sure he can afford the restaurant, but the establishment should adhere to more strict codes, or don't put it in writing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour and yes on a Friday! The pomegranate martini was great, the steak sandwich and steak skewers were delicious. The service was absolutely wonderful, the best that I've ever had at a restaurant, especially seated in the bar. The wait staff is attentive and helpful ready to answer any question you have. Absolutely fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ruth's Chris for dinner before, but this was my first experience with the new lunch menu (launched just on April 15).

I was impressed with the appetizers. The mushroom caps were huge, and dripping with cheese and delectable crab meat. The carpaccio was sliced so thin, and it was seasoned perfectly.

The entrees were, somehow, even better. My ahi tuna salad was bursting with flavour and just a little spice, and my dining companions were equally impressed with their chicken sandwich and steak sandwich. 

Definitely check out the lunch tasties -- it's a nice addition to a restaurant that was already one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Not a bad price for such delicious food. Being a first timer there, I would like to advise Canadians of the following;
menu items are a la carte, but portions are very large. My husband and I could have easily shared the stuffed chicken breast between the two of us, rather than buying/wasting two. 
the sides come family style and are also very generous portions, we did order two sides so we ended up with enough food to feed about 5-6 people. There was no point to us bringing the leftovers home because our hotel room doesn't have a microwave, so it was wasted food/money. But this had to have been the best meal we have had in a long time. What would have made the experience better? The waitress could have been a little more informative. Great time all in all."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I had the petite filet, my boyfriend had the new York strip. Both were great! Cooked to perfection, melts in your mouth. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were our sides and they were soooo good! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is amazing! My husband and I visit Ruth's Chris at least once a month and everytime we leave satisfied. The lobster bisque is yummmmy, my steak is always cooked perfectly. This place is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it! The seafood tiro is absolutely delicious, the meat is juicy. The deserts are absolutist pretty and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best in Las Vegas we have ever had.  We have been to The Old Homestead, Smith and Wollenskysky and this is the best.  The Tomahawk was absolutely amazing.  My wife said her Filet was the best she has ever had.  She orders it medium well which most places don't do correctly.  We would both definitely recommend Ruth Chris in Las Vegas.....for any occasion.  If you like a great quality of meat and great service this is your place."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the food lived up to the expectations I'd heard from others.  The portions were good and the items came at the right time.  I did not feel rushed in any way and our waiter, Jimmy, did an excellent job answering every question we had.  I tried their special house dressing Rimaloud(don't know how to spell it) which was a kind of spicy creamy dressing, which I highly recommend.  My steak was cooked exactly to order and melted in my mouth, one of the best filets I've ever had.  

The restaurant was very nice, the type of place that you'd visit on special occasions, worth the entire experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. They should also offer beds to sleep in. I am stuffed. Had a great time :)"}
{"text":"I have been to another one of these in northern california and I have to say I was disappointed in my steak. It was charred on the outside and I couldn't cut it with my fork like I normally can. Not a good place to check out in Vegas. I would try another steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I had the best steak of my life, but it costed me 50$ with no sides... I had a creme brulee, which was delicious too. On the down side, their sides were only so-so and we were expecting more for the price we paid. The decor was also very sterile and blend. Maybe good for business, but not so much for dates I thought. The service was excellent, but that is what you expect from a $$$$ place. Total bill was 175$ with tips and tax for 2 steaks, 2 sides, and one desert."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good here but the service is terrible.  We were blatantly ignored, so I will not be coming back."}

{"text":"AMAZING!!! Everything about this restaurant is perfect. We usually end up eating Bar side and enjoy the view of the strip. The bartenders are so incredibly nice. Now every time we go to Vegas we have to go say hi! I mean how could u not have the best steak ever while in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse in the city. Always the same high-quality meal every visit. My only complaint is that they don't open before five."}
{"text":"I've been to Ruth's Chris about six or seven times in three different states, and All I can say is, when you franchise restaurants out to individual owners, you get a pretty inconsistant product.

The two here are okay.   I prefer the one near the palms because they get more interesting clientele.

The food is good and the service is prompt.  I always sit at the bar, but did have a large party here for 15 people, and we were treated well.

The bar is open late, and they servefood almost until the end."}
{"text":"It is a steak chain restaurant, but really overall pretty good. If I'm going out for steak, I'm going to Smoky's, Tornado Club, or Harvest or something like that. But Ruth Chris has been growing on me (slowly). The food is a bit overpriced for its quality. Overall consistently good food with great atmosphere, price:quality ratio is a bit high."}
{"text":"Although a bit pricey and I'm not a huge fan of franchises or chains, they arguably do serve the best steak in town.  Even though it is \"up-scale\" I don't consider it a \"snooty\" place.  The service has always been pleasant and unobtrusive.  We have never had a snobby or arrogant server.    

The bone in rib-eye is very good.    The crab-cakes are all right.  I've had them in some of their other locations and the Middleton version is not quite as good but certainly not disgusting. The sides and salads are always excellent but they are ala carte. 

In short...I do like this place and will return but I really do question the value for dollar.  I often wonder how two people can spend that much money.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many RC locations and I was shocked how utterly bland this location is. Worn out too, our booths were badly ripped and saggy. We were the only people in the main dining room at noon...yet we were seated in a 6 person booth so then the assistant spent 10 min painfully asking us to pass the unneeded place servings to him. Oy. I ordered something a little off menu, crab cake on salad, it was barely ok, lots of shell, salad was just a very small portion of plain lettuce. Not a chance I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"Cold dark and lonely. That's the atmosphere. Basement location, chilly regardless of the weather outside. And few other guests on the couple of occasions I've been there. On the plus side, the other guests are, um, elderly, so if you want to feel young by comparison this place is for you. The meat is very good and this is one of the few places that will serve it blue rare, so if you want butcher-quality steak done right, the kitchen won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"Prix Fix lunch was a total bummer. The ratio 10:1 ratio of bread to chicken on the Lemon Chicken sandwich was just plain sad for what I expected from Ruth's Chris. My coworker thought the same of his meal. Very average. Doesn't stand up to the dinner menu."}
{"text":"We went to Ruth's Chris for New Year's Eve dinner with a couple friends and it was amazing! The food was impeccable. I had the tuna steak, it was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the lamb chops, also incredible. All the food was so delicious! Even my friend who is normally insanely picky had nothing bad to say! My friends steaks were cooked to perfection. The cocktails were delectable. The sides do come separately from the meal (about 15 bucks for a side of asparagus with hollandaise sauce) but they are big enough for two to share. The only negative thing I could say was the side of potatoes au gratin was a bit dry. If you want somewhere fancy and delectable this is the place to go. But definitely only if money is no object  A+ for sure."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque tasted burnt.  Sweet potatoe casserole was so sloppy and sweet, not appetizing.  Bread yummy.  Steak was reasonable but quite pricey service was slow"}
{"text":"I still love you!

With all the many choices and new restaurants poping up around the valley its nice to come back to this familiar place. Ruth's Chris is just divine . I am not a big meat eater but you wont catch me passing up one of their steaks baby!    

Yep its pricey, but the best part is coming here at reverse happy hour. C'mon who cant scrape togther some change for $13 surf n turf?   Just order a few appitizers, order your favorite drink and ahhhhhh relax :)"}
{"text":"Only reason I came here is because I had a $100 gift certificate, I still spend another $100 on top of that. Your paying for the name.....there's better steak houses for the $$."}
{"text":"Had to go to Toronto for my first Ruth Chris Steakhouse experience, and I was not disappointed. Everything was excellent, from the polite waitress to the delicious medium-rare petit fillet which I ordered. I do not know if I have had a better hollandaise sauce. 
The only upsetting part of the evening was that they do not have oysters on their menu. Regardless, an excellent steak."}
{"text":"At Ruth's last night, setting is great the views of camelback are great from patio with the restaurant being on second floor.  Staff was great very friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the filet and lobster which was amazing only downside steak came out cooked more than I asked for.  The sides were ok and the desert was awesome.  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I am a big steak eater, and I went with a group of guys to see what all the hype is about.  I ordered the Rib eye, and it was a bit disappointing.  I normally like my beef medium to medium rare, but my rib eye was undercooked.    Atmosphere was nice, and I may come back to try it again.."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for dinner, since I remembered liking the Ruth's Chris Steak House in Portland, ORE (although this was about 6 years ago) and I guess.. I was underwhelmed. I've tried other steakhouses and I've come to realize that Ruth's Chris is definitely not the best steakhouse in the world. However, I gave the place 3 stars because 1) They had good service, 2) While they don't cook the greatest steak in the work, their Rib-eye wasn't bad, 3) The side of mash potatoes were fairly tasty."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! My husband and I went there for our anniversary dinner and I ordered my steak well done. I am pregnant and NEED to have my steak cooked well done for obvious reasons. I cut into my steak and it was raw in the middle. It totally ruined my dinner. We will never be going back. Awful."}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Best steakhouse in Charlotte, hands down!

I recommend one of the bone in steaks. They're the most flavorful. 

The spicy lobster appetizer is banging. The lyonnaise potatoes are rockstar. 

The wine list is awesome as well. Ask for Ricardo!"}
{"text":"Best steak ever. Worth the price. Great service. If anything, they should move it above ground."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that I'm a FAN of this chain...But this location is the worst. The experience was bad from the start. The upscale chain in the middle of a strip mall...the wait time for a confirmed reservation. The Warm Spinach Salad in which was cold with very little dressing(usually served warm hence the name of the salad) then to top it all off my petite fillet with shrimp ordered medium served bloody with fishy shrimp blech....not so much. The sides of steamed Broccoli (hard) and the sweet potatoes (tooooooo sweet). This was the worst dinner that I have ever had in Vegas and at a Ruth's Chris...the only good thing was our server...and the calamari i had elsewhere after eating at this location. Lastly, when i went on line to leave a comment, i never received anything back, so keep driving past this Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Been going here for a while when family comes into town, so far its the best steak I have had and the sweet potato casserole is to die for."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for years,  and tonight I got to mark it off my bucket list.  My husband took me out for my birthday. We ordered off the classic menu so we didn't pay separately for each item. We both had Caesar salads which we very good.  He had swordfish that was the best he has ever had,  with a side of mashed potatoes that were good.  I had a filet topped with shrimp.  Very flavorful. For an extra charge he had a small birthday cake decorated just for me.  It was a lovely evening and I'm glad I finally got to go."}
{"text":"Beware if you make reservations with this location over the phone. Actually, my recommendation would be to NOT make a reservation with this specific Ruth's Chris without confirming documentation. We made reservations over the phone- I have the date and time on my phone record- for an early dinner on New Year's Eve two weeks in advance. There were two time slots available and we chose the earlier of the two. Fast forward to New Year's Eve...we arrive 30 minutes before our reservation time and they claim the reservation \"can't be found\". While they ultimately provided a table there was unnecessary hassle which was completely a product of their negligence. Quality restaurants- especially steakhouses- shouldn't exhibit such incompetence by failing to record reservations which they have conveyed.
Oh yeah, food was typical Ruth's Chris- solid if you like the way they prepare their steaks. Unfortunately, the evening was sullied by the initial episode."}
{"text":"I would normally  give this Ruth's Chris 5 stars because I think that it is just awesome. I've been to this location probably 9 times. The bartenders are terrific. The view is amazing,  the waitstaff is usually beyond reproach.  HOWEVER: If you can avoid Joe V as a waiter do it. Likely the worst waiter I have ever had. COCKY. RUDE, AMBIVALENT, ARROGANT, NOT ATTENTIVE.  It's as if he is bothered to do his job. It took nearly 30 minutes for him to take a drink  order, he was shocked we wanted to order wine. And seemed surprised we had any food or beverage knowledge at all. I actually heard him cackle at us. When we ordered our food we had to wait 20 minutes before he could find a wine list for us to review.  The entire section was laughing at his attitude.  His poor back waiter was trying so hard to clean up after his horrible manners, there was actually a whole group behind us that began openly mocking him. Seriously. You spend 
$300 on dinner for 2 and you have to put up with this prick? Waiters in Paris are more gracious.  We will come back because we like the bar, the food but RUN if you see this guy."}
{"text":"For the price ....  Just AWFUL!
I will give the waitstaff thumbs up.  But $14 for 6 cooked to death shrimp ... Come on ... Shrimp is not hard to cook!  All steaks just thrown on a plate, mine was over cooked and to hungry to send back.  Not going to go on & on .... Just bad!!"}
{"text":"We had not tried this steak house for years. So to celebrate a family event the 2 of us reserved dinner.   Firstly the hostess led us to the worst table in the place which was half empty.
Good Try Chris..but no luck.  We asked to be moved into the light.
Done. We ordered their classic fix price.   Most outstanding was the salad starter.
Least outstanding..everything else.  Steaks a bit tough at medium rare. French fries outrageously overpriced and like from the supermarket frozen food freezer.
The shrimp part of the turf and surf came unheated and flimsy.  
Deserts were OK if you are still into cheesecake in the 21st century.
Service was spotty.
We were dressed to the nines. But across from us were a crowd in T shirts.  There goes the
atomsphere.
We will not return."}
{"text":"Consistent dining experience. Cowboy Ribeye was tender and cooked to order. Huge sides and good service. What this location lacks is ambiance. I've been to the Ruth's Chris in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Maui. This location is in a strip mall and the interior is dated.  If I'm in Vegas again, would probably go to Mortons which is a block away."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal and dining experience. Not the first time I have encountered our server , Caesars. He made a reservation us in the lounge at a beautiful table overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.

I look forward to seeing Caesar on my trips to Las Vegas. I know him as a man of integrity who understands quality customer service from his work at the Bellagio and Paris.

This was my girlfriend's first trip to Las Vegas and exposing her to the excellence that I have come to know here was paramount. I knew i could count on Caesar. Ruth's Chris signature culinary techniques are outstanding and the atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. The evening was even better than I had hoped for. Thank you Caesar, we will be back."}
{"text":"Ok beef-eaters, here comes a review from a non-steak-eater who's an expert at steakhouse dining (blame it on a bevy of serious meat-aholic friends). 

The crusty bread hits the table almost immediately and the drink list is formidable (I demolished a tasty, cold Big Easy). Lots of wine to choose from as well - bottles ranging from under $100 to almost $700. 

Usually steakhouses have a dearth of non-beef alternatives (which I understand), but Ruth's Chris has a pretty nice selection of seafood appetizers and entrees, but only one chicken dish (a stuffed double breast for $29.95). For vegetarians (I would think it's a rare occurrence for you to end up here), there's a portobello entree but not much else, unless you stock up on sides. 

I chose the ahi tuna stack ($39.95), which like all entrees doesn't include a side. For $8.95 you can choose from a wide variety of potatoes and vegetables, plates which are big enough to share with at least two people. The asparagus wasn't anything to write home about, but word on the street is the spinach is terrific. 

My tuna was indeed stacked - two mini-puck portions garnished with tender crab meat served on a sizzling plate. Next time I would order the tuna medium, because the plate cooked my medium-well portion to well done! I couldn't finish it all - paired with half a baked potato, it was well enough to fill my belly to capacity.

The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive (you will never have an empty water glass). But if you make the trip, expect to splurge - steaks are $45-$50 on average, not including sides or drinks. Every once in awhile though, it's nice to treat yourself (or a friend!)."}
{"text":"My family and I went on a busy Saturday night in February right before the dinner rush. We didn't have reservations, but we were told by the hostess that we could grab any open table in the bar area without one. We sat at a highly visible table near the bar. You couldn't miss us if you tried.

First it took the waitress and staff a good 5 minutes to acknowledge us. One person brought drink napkins and menus. Another brought the water that we asked for 10 minutes later. Another person brought the bread eventually. We all ordered the prix fixe menu that included an appetizer, entree and dessert and one kid's meal. It took FOREVER for each course to come out from the kitchen. The check came before the desserts. The waitress didn't even realize that we hadn't yet received the desserts that we ordered and we had to go back to the hostess stand to tackle the manager in order to get our desserts. What a nightmare!

The food was okay. I've been to that particular Ruth Chris and their location in Boston and never had that problem with the service.

So...we ended up having a 2.5 hour meal. It should have taken an hour and a half at most. Didn't the restaurant want to turn over this premium table quickly on a busy Saturday night? Didn't seem like it. They probably lost money by serving us so slowly.

I will never again return to this location for their mediocre food or their poor service. I can spend my hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good steaks, cocktails, service, and ambience. They do a good job hiding the fact that you're in a parking lot across from Costco and UPS. My only complaint is the size of the sides for the price. Fleming's is a better value in that regard, but both are pricey. The shrimp cocktail is excellent. For a better deal, buy the Costco gift cards at 80 cents on the dollar and use them here (20 percent savings)."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here and it was amazing....

Me and my family went to this place recently for restaurant week and it was fabulous. We had a 9:30 reservation and it was still packed at that hour. We figured everyone would be gone! My father got the bistro filet, lobster tail ( at additional cost), w/ mashed potatoes. His filet came out on a sizzling hot plate and it was awesome. I had the salmon w/ sautéed mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly. My sister had the crab cakes (at additional cost) w/ mashed potatoes and they were fresh and yummy. My mother had the stuffed chicken breast w/ mashed potatoes and it was also good and cheesy. At the end of the meal we requested to have our cheesecakes to-go. 

I snuck in the middle of the night to take a bite of it and it was good and creamy....

I would definitely return here again...however most likely during restaurant week or for a special occasion!!! The food here is on the pricey side...but hey you pay for a quality meal!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here this past Friday night...the food and service was amazing. Our servers name was Ryan and he was wonderful.  Our food was delicious and cooked perfectly. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I can now say I've dined at Ruth's Chris and I can also say that I just don't get the hype.  The food was fine, no complaints.  But for the price I expected a really spectacular meal and I got an ok meal.  
I got chicken and my husband had the filet.  Again, no complaints about the food but we felt we could get what we had at a lot of places.

The service was good - We had reservations during restarurant week and I was impressed that we were seated almost exactly on time based on how busy they were.  Our server was fantastic and attentive.  


To Sum up - not a place I would return to."}
{"text":"El lugar es elegante y tradicional, con mucha madera. El servicio es bueno.
Pedí el rib eye y tengo que decir que me sorprendió positivamente. Como Argentina estoy acostumbrada a carne de calidad a la parrilla sin otro condimento que sal, sin embargo este bife estaba muy bien condimentado, era muuuy tierno y sabroso y tenía una salsa de manteca derretida que le daba al plato otra dimensión. Inolvidable. Los acompañamientos están muy bien. Pidan el vino argentino, no se van a arrepentir."}
{"text":"This was a very nice Ruth's Chris, it's kind of in a dumpy strip mall, but worth the cab ride.   As usual, the wine list was excellent but seemed overpriced more than usual.  (I guess it's Vegas.)  The steak is excellent, as usual.  They seemed to cook the steaks extra hot with extra butter, they cautioned us to cover up with the napkins if we didn't want to get burned.  but the steak was wonderful!  The sides were very good, but seemed a little lighter than normal.  The decor is standard steakhouse, tasteful, dark, woody, with bright paintings.  

The service was superb, as always, the manager came out to see how everyone was doing.  As always, an exquisite dining experience (especially if you are into steaks and butter...)"}
{"text":"Great place for a special evening. The service and food was spectacular.

Service: Overall a great experience, the host hung our coats and validated our parking. The waiter explained the cooking process of their steaks and was attentive throughout the meal.

Food: Perfectly cooked steak and the sides were as expected. I had the Alberta beef and it was tender and seasoned appropriately. One of the nice touches was the plate is served extremely hot to keep the steak warm when you are eating it.

Note: Dress code is not enforced but the atmosphere calls for business causal at a minimum."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. From the greeting at the door, through the servers and other staff, service was impeccable. Had the bbq shrimp and petit filet and my husband had the lobster bisque and petit filet. Cooked to perfection. Sides were lobster mac and mushrooms. Delicious. Recommend highly for a special dinner or to start the year off right."}
{"text":"This was the worst Ruth's branch I have ever gone to.
We ordered soup and salad to start but the soup was not warm enough & salad was not fresh at all.
The manager didn't charge us for the food but I think they really need to fix that place."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...this is a compilation of my last three visits to RCSH and my experiences were all the same.  Why go back?  I was given a number of gift cards over the last couple years and used each one.  I now ask that I NOT be given anything to do with this restaurant..  Here are the reasons:

1.  Confirmed reservations were ignored or not honored.  The final visit resulted in an hour wait.  Yea that was a great anniversary visit waiting at the bar.
2.  The staff is uniformly ignorant about customer service.  Is it so hard to take less than 30 minutes to come and take the order?  Can you come back sometime again during the meal?  Why do I wait another half hour to be asked if I want coffee and dessert once my plate is removed? Does each visit really have to take 2 and a half hours? I exempt the bus staff as they tried.
3.  The food is ordinary...no comparison to The Capital Grille or others.
4.  Each and every time we had such bad service we were given free desserts.  They clearly understood that our experience was bad.

Please FIX 1, 2,& 3 above.  I don't care about the dessert if the rest of my experience is so awful.

After the last time I have stopped going and will not be back.  There are other places that give you great value for your time and money so take the opportunity and go elsewhere.  Scottsdale has Atlas Bistro and Monarch Cafe that can rock your socks off."}
{"text":"This is a review for the happy hour only, which we ate at twice during spring training.

It was just great, seared tuna, mini sliders, lobster something or other.  Deserts were amazing, the banana cream pie was to die for, the bread pudding wasn't bad either.
Everything is half price, great friendly service, it's on a lovely terrace where you can watch the sunset...I'd go back anytime I'm down there."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual for this place. Great location. Looks out over strip, good for people watching. Was not crowded and we were able to get easy reservations."}
{"text":"This is the first time me and my girlfriend have ever gone to a Ruth's Chris and it will not be our last. The food was great and so were our drinks, however it was the service that made our night. Our server Paul was unbelievable. Not only was he attentive to all of our questions but he was extremely knowledgable for all things to do with our current dining experience and for information that could benefit us in our everyday life. He was quick to inform us on different wines that we could find that were similar and just as amazing as the ones we were having. He could converse with us and enthral us about stories about life and the hospitality industry. The food was great and the drinks fuelled our night, but Paul's service made our night. So if you are planning a night at Ruth's Chris downtown, make sure to ask for Paul, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"With a Costco gift card from a well meaning relative, an opportunity arose to visit this restaurant. Our mouths were watering over what we thought was going to be a delicious meal. I felt bad they had wasted their money. Firstly, the interior is devoid of any obvious design and  the lack of  flow through the lobby to the restaurant leaves us standing amidst milling patrons arriving and leaving, being jostled about. No one greeted us and so my husband had to get the attention of the Hostess whose head was buried in her reservations book. With a reservation we still waited several minutes to be seated and were lead to the back of the first area. To see our menus we had to hold them under one half of the table that was lit from above. The other was in total darkness. The area was full but quiet, mostly business men and one family with 2 teenagers. No one looked very excited to be there. Definitely No buzz here. A waiter poured us water and I opened the menu. Straight forward fare. Steaks in about 5 cuts, no prime rib, and veggie sides. A great way to gouge customers. A waitress approached and asked our drink order, we took a bottle of Bordeaux @ $45. She returned to ask if we had been here before and launched into a mono-tonal rehearsed monologue very loudly about not touching the molten hot plates and shielding ourselves with our napkins from splattering butter. I immediately felt awkward and uncomfortable, She suggested what we probably wanted and to share a side dish. My husband had a steak and I the crab cakes. The steak was delivered sizzling and molten hot cooked to his spec. but lacked basic flavour.($54)  Mine were three large ice cream scoops of bland pap coloured crab cooked flavourlessly.($36) The broccoli, steamed well but boring presentation.($8 for 5 pieces)  Mashed potato was very smooth and buttery.($8)
We were asked multiple times for things we'd given answers to already. It was annoyingly evident that whatever spark existed here years ago has long since fizzled out. This place really has nothing going for it other than a continual stream of first time tourist customers. But, the plate does sizzle. Not Recommended."}
{"text":"Dropped in around 4:30 for happy hour the first week they were open to the public. 

I think it was worth the wait for them to open (seems like it was under construction forever).  The hosts at the door (200 Public Square lobby entrance) was extremely pleasant immediately greeting us and asking if we were there for happy hour.  He then walked us through the deceivingly spacious restaurant and down to the bar/lounge area.  Not at all crowded when we got there but packed 45 minutes later. 

We were then immediately greeted by the bar tender who introduced himself and the other bar tender by name, explained the happy hour specials and asked what our names were so that he could call us by them the rest of our visit.  I won't deduct points for him calling me by a different name most of the time :) .

Great happy hour with $9 food and drink specials (plus certain beers are $4).  We had the ahi tuna and tenderloin skewer salad.  Both were delicious and a very decent portion for being on a happy hour menu.  The happy hour wines were also very good. 

Will definitely return to try other happy hour items and for regular dinner."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for restaurant week last Tuesday. We had reservations at 8:15 but didn't get seated until around 8:30 pm. 

When we sat down, our server Chris introduced himself and was very welcoming. He thanked us for our patience with the wait and said we could order an appetizer on him/Ruth Chris. We were thrilled because we were planning on ordering one anyways. He made a great selection on the red house blend and I'm not a huge red wine drinker! But that was very good. 

Our food was amazing and our water glasses hardly ever saw the bottom of the glass. Everyone was wonderful. The restaurant week menu came with a duo dessert: banana bread pudding and cheesecake. My sister and I are not big fans of either and only had one bite of each. Chris noticed and asked how they were. I told him I'm wasn't a huge fan of either and I told him I felt VERY bad telling him that. He offered me ice cream but I told him it was really okay and it wasn't a big deal. He went to go put something away and came back to say he doesn't want us going home disappointed with the dessert so he will provide us a chocolate dessert duo. Another positive point for Chris. When he came back, I told I was in Heaven and I could cry. Their chocolate molten cake is to die for!!!! 

There were a group of men who had been drinking at the bar and during our dessert, they got pretty loud. One of the employees (don't want to name his job title incorrectly) had said, \"I want to apologize for that. That's extremely uncalled for.\" My sister and I laughed and said it was no big deal. We just laughed at the guys.

We made reservations in September to come back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service was suspect.  We were there on a weekend night and the restaurant was largely an empty cavern.  We were seated but before we ordered dinner the waiter advised us that he was being let go for the evening and that someone else would be taking care of us.  From that point forward, we rarely saw any wait or service staff.  Given that the restaurant was so empty there were no service people nearby.  We would have purchased more drinks if we had only been waited on properly.  The food that we got was very good. The timing on the food was off however.  Salads were barely served before the main entrees were delivered.  Drinks had to be asked for several times before they were delivered.  We were told that this particular location doesn't have the shoestring fries because the restaurant is too big and they would get cold before they were delivered to the table; in reality we know now that the fries would get cold because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is so good!  I can't say much more than that.
Few things to note before reading my review:
1)This is the only upscale steakhouse I've been to(I still want to try Jacob's)
2)I have been to other upscale restaurants so I can attest to the service being impeccable.

Decor/Location:
So I'm not a restaurant designer so I don't know the actual reasoning for their location but it's located underground so that means no natural light.  But that doesn't matter to me because it achieves that candlelight dinner/romantic feel.  Maybe the absence of windows allows diners to really pay attention to each other because there are less distractions. The seating and tables are what I expected: fine dining appropriate.
It's lighting is a bit darker than a traditional restaurant but again, I like that candlelight ambiance.
This is the perfect restaurant to go to if you plan on going to see a performance at the Four Seasons Opera House next door.  Though, don't eat too heartily or else you'll fall asleep then!

Food:
I've been to Ruth's Chris two times and i've shared the porterhouse two times.  If you've never had a good porterhouse, you need to order it here.  It essentially is a giant t-bone steak.  They pre-cut pieces of the meat off of the bone so you can share it.  I dare you to try to eat it yourself! The sides are quite large I must say.  I was greedy the first time and shared potatoe wedges and mashed potatoes and a porterhouse.  To say the least, we had to take doggy bags and...bring them into the Opera House..haha:P


**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS segway**

So I lied about the number of times I've been to Ruth's Chris.  I've actually been 2 more times but just for take out!  But you would never guess what I got for take out.  ONION RINGS. This is one of the biggest gems for onion ring lovers.  They are absolutely HUGE.  You get 5 massive rings (size of a donut or more) and if you dine-in, they stack it up like a pyramid.  These by far have to be one of the best onion rings I've ever had and I love onion rings.  They're battered nicely, thick and juicy.

**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS segway**


Service/Presentation:
By now, you'd be thinking, \"Great food,nice ambiance, this place is good stuff!\".  But Service should always be factored into the equation when rating a fine dining establishment.
Firstly, as with most upscale dining restos, you need to make reservations.  When we arrived, we had to wait about 10 minutes for our reservation because they were extremely busy that night.  It's an understandable trend in all restaurants but what really set them apart was that they immediately gave us a 40$ gift card for the inconvenience! By the way, that's probably why I was greedy and ordered so much...:P   Anyways, I've never been to a restaurant that does that so I was really happily surprised.
Our service was attentive and courteous.  We told him we had an opera to catch and he made his best effort to ensure we got to our show in time by speeding up our order.
The next comment is on the presentation of food, mainly the plates.  I'm not sure if all steakhouses work this way but we each get heated, buttered plates.  When you get the steak (on a separate plate), when you take a piece of the steak and put it on your buttered plate, you'll hear a sizzle!  Didn't know it could get any better then that!


Overall:
Great experience, great food, great service, great presentation = memories and desire to return!

{"text":"We went to Ruth's Chris Steak House on a Tuesday night during restaurant week.  Despite having a reservation, we ended up waiting for 45 minutes.  The food was good, but I wouldn't gush about it.  I don't care for the way they seem to overcharge for everything.  For example, the wait staff cruised by asking if we would like a glass of sparkling water.  She poured us a glass and we later discovered we were charged $6.50 for bottled water.  Likewise, $3.50 for a small cup of coffee seems pricey.

While the ambiance is nice, it's not a place one would routinely go due to the cost. I can think of 5-6 other restaurants that have food that is just as good or better quality at a lesser costs.

If you do have dinner here, make sure you have enough $$ in your checking account to cover the cost."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say, I love their food! It is a pricey place, but like the saying goes, \"You get what you pay\". I definitely suggest everyone who likes steak, must try their food at least once."}
{"text":"Went: Sun, Sept 6, 2015 7:30 p.m. (77/100)
Ordered: Mushrooms stuffed with crab meat, Cowboy ribeye, Ruth's Signature coffee (Bailey's with whipped cream), cappucino, and key lime pie
Cost: $140 with tax and tip.

My girlfriend loves steak and I thought I would like to try Ruth's Chris.  So we decided to go there as part of our romantic weekend. 

We got there half an hour early but they seated us right away. Our waiter Andrew was excellent throughout the whole evening and made sure we were both taken cared of. 

The decor did not really stand out.  The interior design is very minimalistic, though we liked their theme of roundness and curves. There was a giant pillar like structure near us. This added some privacy, but also gave a somewhat claustrophobic vibe.

We were introduced to a novel concept in dining -- a 500 degree hot plate, used to keep food piping hot.

The complimentary bread was warm and fresh but we both found the exterior to be a bit tough and chewy, and did not enjoy them too much.

The appetizer we ordered was the mushroom stuffed with crabmeat. Because it was served on the 500° plate, the last bite was still hot and fresh. The mushrooms were juicy.  The crabmeat filling was also moist. The torched cheese was a bit salty, but we found if you only ate half the filling, it was almost perfect and delicious. 

We did a crashed course in eating steak before heading to the restaurant.  Since we liked our steak with tender and with rich flavour, the more marbled ribeye seemed like a perfect choice, choosing to share the 22 oz. Cowboy Ribeye. Once again, the steak was served on the 500° plates.  It was cooked to perfection -- medium rare, just the way we like it.  The only problem was that as we ate, the steak continued to cook which changed the texture and consistency from medium rare to well done. Thus, the last bite of the steak we had from Elements which was essentially cold tasted a lot better than the still hot last bite here. My date didn't enjoy the second half of the steak.

We wanted something light to balance out the heavy main course, so key lime pie was our choice. The pie was average at best and tasted like pie you could get at most places. Ruth's Specialty Coffee impressed and was filled with flavour. The cappucino was good.

Overall, the service was excellent. Thank you very much, Andrew. Everyone was very attentive.  We did feel special and well taken care of. It was a very special night, though I think we both wish that the food itself would have played a bigger part into why it was so special.

Bottom line: Know that your steak will continue cooking as you eat it. My date would recommend coming here. I don't think I would choose to return and would probably look to find a better steak elsewhere. The food gets 3.5 stars; the customer service gets 5.0 for an overall rating of 4.0 stars."}
{"text":"This is the best steak I've ever had since the last time I came here and had the best steak I've ever had. This time I challenged them to char it but deliver it medium rare. It came out perfectly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ruth's Chris in Vegas in 15-20 years and was excited to go again when I visited this week. I was very disappointed that their only location is now in a hotel/casino - Harrahs of all places!!!
Not loving having to park and walk so far just to have a nice dinner"}
{"text":"Excellent good and excellent service. Great view of the strip and the ambience is lovely. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Steak = Great. 
Service = left a lot to be desired. 

Overall, not sure if the meal was worth the price."}
{"text":"We were 4 people for lunch on 7/3. Food was great. Fantastic burgers. Go there ask for Beth. She is the nicest server you can have"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the fillet and shrimp and it was the best steak I've had in quite some time. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"This review doesn't have to be long, so here's what you need to know: This place is great! The food isn't amazing but the place is pretty quiet and it's a good place to have a casual conversation."}
{"text":"This place is not for the penny pinchers. Went for New Years. Had a prix fix dinner 99$ per person for appetizer, entree, side, dessert, and a glass of champagne. Amazing, attentive, quick service. Satisfaction is of the utmost important. Good for a splurge!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a Marine and I thought this would be a great place to have a nice dinner before he has to leave for almost a month of training. I made reservations and we arrived about 15 minutes early. Only 20 seconds after walking in the door, our hostess showed us to our table in a smaller dining room but was still open and inviting. And then we met our server, Kev. Oh Kev. Literally was the nicest server I ever had. He was very quick to smile and make nice conversation with me and my boyfriend. He was very quick  to clear our empty plates and keep glasses full and make suggestions as to what to order for dinner. I took his suggestion and ordered the petite filet Oscar style. Oh. My. Goodness. It was delicious. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the crab on top was perfect as well. The hollandaise was to die for.  I have been dreaming of eating this steak every day since. My boyfriend ordered the ahi tuna stack. A lot lighter than my filet but equally as delicious. We split a side of the mashed potatoes which were good too. We were unable to finish the potatoes from being so full from the entrees. The general manager stopped by our table to see if everything was good. We explained our reason for the mashed potatoes going unfinished, but she still added a discount to our bill and a free slice of sin cake. That was above and beyond the quality of service than I expected. After the entrees, I ordered a black coffee to eat with the sin cake. Very glad I did. The sin cake was very rich and chocolatey and the black coffee was a great compliment with it. I had to throw in the towel after polishing off my coffee but my boyfriend finished off the cake. We nearly rolled out of the restaurant from being so full, but extremely happy. I will definitely return for another special occasion soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great steak. Pricey though. If too pricey for you they have a great happy hour"}
{"text":"Visited last evening for a special birthday dinner. The most delicious Lobster Bisque I have ever tasted... Smooth and buttery.  The Sirloin steak was to die for."}
{"text":"Please don't get me wrong here - the steak is perfect. Delicious. I think the server said that it was served on a something crazy like a plate heated to 550 degrees. Long story short - they know their steak.

However, I suppose when it comes to rating this joint I have to take into consideration all factors. For one thing, the environment is a little... umm.. stale? Walking in their it felt something like a cross between a library in Essex and a cigar shop: real dark, woody, and people are generally quiet. That is until the several tables of businessmen who are there to bill their meal to the company get through their second bottle of vino.

Our server was impeccable - really attentive and friendly, and to boot, delivered us a 'happy anniversary' flourless chocolate cake slice on the house for dessert! Now that's service. The rest of the meal though, as delicious as it was, was just too much heavy food in one go, and it don't run cheap either. 

The calamari appetizer was average - deep fried with this okay but unnecessary tangy sauce on top at $17. An 8-oz filet goes for $50, and sides are ordered separately at $9 each. The steaks were great, I ordered the very tender melt in your mouth filet, while my dining partner had the monster 16-oz Cowboy Steak (also $50). Both were good, the filet was obviously much more tender, and the steaks are served on melted butter as our server previously warned us. For sides, we went with the shoestring fries which were wonderfully seasoned, but there was just toooo much. Steamed spinach, also good, but just toooooo much again - and honestly, steamed spinach for $9? I suppose you pay for what you get, but just how tasty can steamed spinach really be? 

All in all, the bill came to about $215 (including tax and tip), which was  in my opinion, far too pricey for the meal. There are plenty of other places in the city to go if you plan on spending mucho cash-ola where the overall experience is much more satisfying."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get.  I would rather spend my money and go to 3 or 4 other less expensive places and get just as good food.

The service we did receive was very good."}
{"text":"awesome service ,
best t bone steak i have ever tasted, came out sizzling !! 
tastiest lobster tail
good side dishes, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus
chocolate cake was a little rich for me but went great with the wine
 brought our own wine and i dont think they charged a corkage fee :)
decor was simple
outside did not impress me
on the pricier side but i never mind if the food and service are up too par. and both exceeded my expectations.
location was off the strip, would of preferred a nicer view
highly recommend"}
{"text":"Splurged and took my family there last week. Made a reservation and we arrived we were promptly seated right next to the server station where we were able to witness all orders being placed in the computer and hear what each employee was doing this weekend. Really should have asked for a decent table but my son had his girlfriend along so didn't want to make a scene. Food was great as expected, though we sat and patiently waited for our plates to be cleared and order desert along with 2 of us needing refills on drinks. After eventually  piling our plates up for removal, we finally were able to catch the eye of our server  as she and another employee were watching the playoff games from the server area. She then told us that someone would be out to clear our plates which several minutes later someone did....news flash you clear the plates and quit watching the nfl playoffs. So after that our server returned and we were able to get some refills and order desert. I expected the $300 tab for dinner but also expected superior service which was NOT given. So,,,,, overall great food but they need to pull their head out of the clouds and fix their service issues. I won't be back despite the food"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris was top notch! My dad always said a good steak needs nothing on it. Ruth's Chris has that steak. My husband usually asks for A-1 but not this time! The family-style sides were just as good. The chipotle fingerling potatoes were most memorable!  

We went during Restaurant Week which had a limited menu for $44. We found  out they have a 'special' limited menu all the time for $45 and $54 that includes a starter, entree w/ side, and dessert. Regardless of which menu you choose to order from, it's worth the price. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"New to the Ruth's Chris happy hour scene- our second time going and you can't beat the prices for awesome food at a fantastic place. We had the steak sandwich and burger which were delicious and cheap!

Our server both times has been Rebecca. She is delightful and great to customers! If you go, whether in the main dining room or on the patio for happy hour see if she is working. She is worth it! She is friendly to everyone, very knowledgeable and really on top of it!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had my birthday dinner at Ruths Chris steakhouse. I must say I had a terrific experience, I ordered the filet medium and the lobster mac and cheese. First off the filet was delicious perfect amount of pink with a great consistency, I even topped it off with a dollop of bernaisse sauce! My lobster mac and cheese was great as well, the slight kick of peppers with the taste of fresh cold water lobster goes perfectly together. I wrapped my AMAZING meal off with a berry-lemon vodka drop and just had a terrific night. 5 stars is an understatement."}
{"text":"This place has the best view for a nice dinner. My family and I frequent here often. The food is always perfectly prepared and the service is just what you would expect from a nice steak house. They also have a lovely patio that you can have drinks on and just enjoy the weather. This is by far my favorite Ruths Chris in the greater Phoenix area"}
{"text":"2nd time here at the WI one.  It was a date night for me last night.  The maître d' remembered my party from last time; nice touch.  Mary & Joseph (really, no pun intended) took care of us at the bar w/ a Grey Goose martini 'Up' for him and an Apple'tini for moi.

I also had the shrimp cocktail with my spirit.  Our server was Sarah, such a good sport and informative and our attendant was Amparo.  She was also very nice.

Our meal consisted of the following:

For Me: 

Steak House Salad
8 oz Lobster Tail
Small Mashed Potatoes
Chocolate Sin Cake & Coffee

For Him:

Caesar Salad
Lamb Chops
Small Broccoli
LFE Shiraz
Dessert of berries & cream

For a total of $163 and change.  Succulent food, great service, stiff drinks and great giggly time for me."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Both the wife's and my steaks were over cooked. Mine was well done (ordered rare) and hers was well (from a medium order). The waiter told us it was the lighting before finally conceding. The two tables next to us sent their food back too. Waiter reached across wife and forked her steak to put on a plate to take back... Not top tier service by any means. 

Manager offered us a side dish as an apology... We declined. So much for a special dinner. The one and only time Flemings has messed up a steak they comp'd.  But that's probably because it's so rare that it happens there, clearly not the case at Chris's. Pretty sad, nowhere near the hype. For $100/ea (no drinks) I'd expect better service and better quality food."}
{"text":"The Blue Crab Cakes is mostly real crab, one of the best crab cake in town.  There are 2 in an order.  Its taste is enticed with butter and lemon.

The Porterhouse for Two is really for the meat lover.  The portion is huge and the steak is very thick.  It is cooked perfectly juicy medium rare.  The plate is warmed with lots of butter.  You can see the butter all over.  Although it is not very healthy, it is very good to try once in a while

The meat is aged enough to have its texture soft, tender and juicy."}
{"text":"First time at Ruth's Chris and I was very impressed...Service was on point (with Stewart) as head waiter, as well as several staff members who ensured that dinner was running smoothly (\"Angela\" was the biggest stand-out)...All of the food and drink was delicious, especially the sweet potato casserole, and cigars on the front patio sealed the deal...All in all, great experience...will return again definitely for business as well as pleasure!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but I was not blown away. Nice atmosphere. No loud music or tvs. It was cold... and I don't get cold easily. The experience was kind of silly. A little too ceremonious for my taste. The waitress seemed did and scripted. My steak was huge and nicely cooked, but not the most flavorful. I guess I was hoping for more considering what I paid."}
{"text":"Last visit was the perfect steakhouse experience. They even took my daughter to the back to see the lobster tank. Thanks for making us feel so welcome, Im back in!"}
{"text":"I had a $50 gift card and since that can't get you much off the regular menu, we went on a Friday night for their Happy Hour specials. Great deal! $5 caesars (we got a few of those), burger dish, shrimp dish, a salad off the regular menu and the calamari were our order. All really good - my husband liked that the calamari had some veggies in it too, and I liked that the shrimp came with some mashed potatoes. We asked for the fries to be substituted with zucchini fries, and that was great too :) Overall, an enjoyable night, well priced apps, and really good service. Other deals are available on other nights, so check that out too :)"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris is one of my Favorite Chain Prime Steakhouse almost a tie with another one but they are more expensive than my #1 and their side dishes are not as good. 

But the flavor of the steaks OMG are amazing. It so tender and buttery have you ever cut room temperature butter with a knife yeah that's the same ways this steak cuts! And just melts in your mouth with flavor and juiciness! 

It was a great night the service was top notch, we went with his recommendations for selecting wines and dessert. It was a really great experience for the special occasion you can't go wrong here if you are true Steak-Snob!"}
{"text":"I love Ruth Chris Steak House but hold up not the one by the Biltmore on Camelback road. I could have received better service at Applebee's if you ask me,. My waiter's name was Joann, and Lord have mercy the lady needs to get a new profession because being a waitress is not something she does very well.
                    When I go to Ruth Chris I know I'm paying for outstanding service, perfect ambiance, and  mouthwatering food. This trip the only thing satisfying was the food. Joann had the nerve to let dishes pile up on table,( had a stack of dishes on table she walked past 2 times without removing dishes, when asked to remove them she only moved a few) had to ask several times for refills on soda, bread ( usually waiters sweep in without being asked to refill those items), every time we asked for something she would say OK and rush off without waiting to see if anyone else at table needed anything. 
 Manager came and asked if everything was OK, we of course said no, Joann comes back after our talk with Manager and says she will give one of the guest at the table one free glass of wine, fills bad that everyone had refills on pop and she was drinking wine with no refills (WTH). For the service she should of gave us a bottle on the house
 The food was outstanding as usual i had seafood trio (scallops,lobster tails, shrimp), two other guest  did the stuffed chicken( blew me away stuffing inside  chicken is to die for, and enough for two people to eat), and one guest had lamb( to gamey but for people who like gamey food i suppose its a win mother in law enjoyed it).

I will never come back the location in the Biltmore area ever again, But Ruth Chris in Scottsdale area has wonderfull service, atmosphere, and food , worth every penny."}
{"text":"I come to Ruth's Chris about once or twice a year. I always order a ribeye steak, and my wife orders the filet.

I love the simplicity of the steak: salt, pepper, butter, and heat. The meat is tender and juicy. However, the last couple of times I have been someone's steak hasn't been cooked quite to order. My ribeye on my last visit was cooked medium rare, instead of medium, and my wife's filet came med rare when she asked for med well. We complained about her filet, they recooked, didn't get it right again, then took it off the bill (much appreciated). My experience is that they tend to cook the meat one level below what you ask.

We ordered salads, sweet potato casserole, and creamed spinach as sides. The blue cheese dressing is outstanding, especially if you enjoy chunks of blue cheese. The sweet potato casserole was sweeter than we like; it was more dessert and side dish. The creamed spinach was mildly flavored with cream and cheese; I enjoyed it.

For dessert I received samplers of the chocolate mousse and carrot cake. The latter was my favorite; I've been craving it ever since. The mousse was a close second, and came in a chocolate cup that was just as fun to eat as the mousse.

Unfortunately, I can't give RC more than 3 stars given the service I've received (very good, but not great, esp. for an expensive restaurant), and it's a steak place, so that steak should come out perfect. It's still my favorite steak restaurant, but if I went to high end steak restaurant's more often I might try to frequent some of the others, like Donovan's and Morton's."}
{"text":"GEW.  Just another overrated and overpriced chain steakhouse (not to say all chain steakhouses are bad; Del Frisco's is decidedly not bad).

I will go through all the things I tried and why each, minus the desserts, sucked:

- BREAD: step up your bread game, RC.  This was some of the worst restaurant bread I've ever had.  It was like a warmed up Harris Teeter \"french roll.\" Bland, dry... so unsatisfactory.

- HARVEST SALAD: fine, this didn't suck, per se. it was just fine, but c'mon, it's a salad.

- OSSO BUCCO RAVIOLI: ordered as an appetizer. did not like. the tastes in this dish did not go well with each other.

- LAMB CHOPS: medium rare with mint jelly. frowny face. basically hunks of lamb fat served with mint jelly from a jar. I know, I know, who gets lamb at a steakhouse -- whatever, I just wanted to try them.  Lesson learned.  And I guess for the price, I thought they would at least have a mint chutney or something... not the mint version of canned cranberry sauce.

- NEW YORK STRIP: medium (sigh). Despite being medium, this was the best of the three meat dishes.  It was fine.

- RIBEYE: medium rare. I don't even know what wasn't good about it.  It just didn't taste good nor did I enjoy the texture.  BLT's ribeye puts this one to shame.

- LOADED BAKED POTATO: seriously, RC... w.t.f. My potato was undercooked so instead of being soft and flaky, it was hard and chunky. like bread, a baked potato should be a gimme... yet, RC didn't do either right.

- CREAMED SPINACH: so so so bland.

- MASHED POTATOES: so so so mediocre.

- ONION RINGS: fine. 

- APPLE TART: delicious. 

- CHEESECAKE: so delicious.

- SERVICE: server was average. bussers were surly as hell. food runners were confused. literally took about 20 mins. for us to get our check and pay. nothing annoys me more than being ready to leave and the server won't take my money.

I wish I could use my words better to explain why the steaks were not good... alas, what I said above will have to suffice.  If you want a good steak, go to BLT or Del Frisco's.  Don't come here. Don't go to Fleming's, either.  It's worse than RC."}
{"text":"We visit Ruth's 3-4 times annually and across the country.  This evening we had the unpleasant experience of sitting in the west room with 4 families and 11 children under the age of 7.  The adults were related/connected.  They sat at four different tables, talked loudly between tables as if they were the only people in the room, and the only way to describe the children, the screaming kids section.  I asked before we were seated to be relocated and was advised by the hostess all other tables in the restaurant were taken.  However, shortly after we were seated, another couple asked as they were being seated and were quickly relocated.  We were apparently allowed only one glass of water, as it was never refilled and attempts to get the busboy's attention were unsuccessful."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, wonderful steak.  Discontinued best onion rings; very sad.  Wonderful view and staff."}
{"text":"We love the bar here large with a great atmosphere. The staff is great. This Ruth Chris has more appetizers than others we've visited. Happy hour till 7 with special drinks and apps. TV's at the bar and occasional small piece live music. Usually most crowded 5 - 6:30."}
{"text":"I have to say I definitely love Ruth's Chris- one of the best meals I've ever had- from the silky lobster bisque, the sizzling melt in your mouth filet, to the super stud waiter Sean who was fabulous all night and then surprised me with the most luscious creme brulee. Mmmmm- I can definitely be seduced with this place- I think its named after me for a reason ;)."}
{"text":"An evening at Ruth Chris is always a wonderful treat. The quality of the food is only surpassed by the excellence of the service. It is a place to celebrate a special occasion, or just a treat."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a steak and they know how cook it to the way you prefer it, I've been known to eat my steak blue rare, and some places don't know what that is so that's a bonus. When you order your steak you have a choice of getting side dishes which you can share which is nice, I normally get the creamed spinach but find it hasn't been as good the last couple of times, asparagus is always good though. One thing to point out is, to be successful, you need two key things, good quality meat and great timing. The people that like it rare, you can't ever overcook it because that would really be a turn off, the chewiness would drive them nuts, for the person that likes medium, medium well, the sight of red or bloody drippings can make them ill.

Even though I like Ruth Chris, I find that the fact they use a truckload of butter to cook their steaks to be the main reason why people love their steaks......its kind of like cheating, who doesn't like butter?"}
{"text":"The worst steak I've ever had. I had a $75 Kobe beef steak that had a stick of butter melted over the top. WTF!? What kind of restaraunt would do that to a steak? 

I also burned my hand on the steak plate that comes from the oven. I'm all for a hot plate, but giving a customer a plate capable of a 3rd degree burn, is that really necessary?!"}
{"text":"Salad was very stringy, fibery, and didn't have much in the way of fresh, crispy flavor. The golden champagne vinaigrette was bland and light, didn't add much to the salad.

Steak was actually pretty good. A giant ol' ribeye. It was drowning in butter so it was crazy flavorful and very filling. I usually prefer my steaks well-seasoned as opposed to sitting in a puddle of butter though. But there's no denying its deliciousness. Plus, they cooked it medium rare as I requested so that provided the steak with a great burst of flavor too!

The side of sweet potato casserole tasted much like dessert rather than a complimentary side, much like creme brulee. Shame. It would've made for a great dessert but it didn't match the steak well at all. We ended up requesting additional sides of mashed potatoes for our steak. The mashed potatoes were decent. A good starchy contrast to the steak.

Chocolate sin cake was simplistic and dichromatic with straight-up fudge chocolate foundation and raspberry sauce. Tasted like a costco cake, really. A while Ruth's Chris certainly isn't known for desserts, I expect better from a high-end steakhouse."}
{"text":"50 minutes for a happy hour sandwich. Really??  Wednesday not Friday or Saturday. No standing. God was great and the wait staff was great but 50 minutes for a sandwich. Applebee's can do better.  Plus the small steak half medium and half well done.  Too bad.  Must be a management problem."}
{"text":"How many twelve step programs am I going to need to get over my new addiction to the blackberry vodka they serve at Ruth Chris? Superb! Yes, my steak was delish, the ambience perfect and I'm not sure if my waiter knew that I wasn't actually royalty but hey, I'll roll with it. Here's where RC scores big points in my books, a few days after my \"big night out\" I called the establishment to find out what kind of magic was in that vodka or at least the brand that I was drinking. Ruth didn't answer the phone herself but the help I had made me feel like the staff really care and understand the product produced and they went over and above so I'm going to yelp about it! Thanks Ruth Chris staff! 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Had wine and apps at the bar. I had the Ahi Tuna. Presentation was great and it tasted good. Service was horrible! One bartender chatted with a friend of hers all evening, and the second was concerned about breaking down the bar for closing. It was difficult to order a drink and it took forever to have our dirty dishes removed."}
{"text":"The best Fillet Mignons and creamy mashed potatoes ever. 5 star service and food. For those of us that can afford the best and want to treat someone special this is the place."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good too greasy. The seafood entree had way too much oil on felt like I was eating seafood with grease. The stake as well very greasy with butter on top and a lard or oil underneath the steak. Salad as well covered with oil and garlic (really heavy on the oil). Don't think I'll want to go back. Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Was not a fan. The steak looked like it had been torn up and twisted into many parts. Looked nothing like what we ordered. The taste was very bland. We both had a horrible time there. Service was atrocious and we felt like we were being treated poorly. We may give them another chance but at the one up-town as I care nothing about going back to this one."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to get to attend the \"Cakebread\" wine event a few nights ago.  The  wine was exceptional and the wedge salad with Roquefort dressing was the best I have ever had. The tiny portion of lobster and the tiny desert were the only disappointments of a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"A little disappointed.

Food was mediocre for its luxury restaurant type. The appetizer (salad) was salty. The entree (steak) was more rare than what you would get in any other high end restaurants.   The sides for the entree were very plain, nothing special. The only good thing was the desserts. I'd give 2 stars for appetizer and entree and 5 stars for desserts.

The service was surprisingly low quality for its restaurant type. The server served the wrong appetizer that was order. The server dropped the pepper holder, dropped the sides at the table and also dropped the debit/credit portable machine while handing it over. I'd give just a 1 star for Service and 4 stars for the environment and decor (washrooms were clean too)."}
{"text":"What is the number one rule of any great steakhouse?  Get the temperature right!  Nothing can ruin a very expensive meal faster than an incorrectly cooked steak.  It just seems so demoralizing after waiting all day to get that juicy taste of Medium Rare Goodness to then bite into a worn leather tough steak.  BOTH of our medium rare steaks came out this way.  Given that we had a show to catch and didn't want to have to wait longer than we already had, we didn't ask them to correct it (which I am sure they would have).

We decided to come here because the GF used to love going to the old closed-down location in town.  The steak was always cooked perfectly with great flavor, the service was impeccable, and the experience wonderful.  This location missed on all counts.  I really did get the sense they were trying, but it just didn't work.  And we really wanted it to work.  The steak was very tough, it seemed maybe even more than just from the overcooking.  The service was both slow and rushed over the course of the same meal.  Forking over this much cash for a meal that was in no way enjoyable for either of us was just painful, especially when you are treating your love to a meal that is supposed to be special.  When we should have been celebrating our special occasion with joy, I found myself apologizing over and over again for surprising her with the new Ruth's Chris (she didn't know they had opened this location).  We are really hoping that they just weren't on their game, and that they will get back on to par with the levels of the old location.  But until we hear from multiple people that they have turned the corner and gotten everything running smoothly, sadly we won't be returning.  There are just too many other great steak houses in town to hope they have improved after this experience."}
{"text":"Food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Cocktail was beautifully coated with sugar around the glass. However, not so happy to learn they are only working on implementing sustainable seafood standards. This is the only reason I would not return, as fish is a huge component of the menu and there is no reason a high end place like this can't get that sorted out with suppliers ASAP. Please no farm fed fish that require catching wild fish to feed them, no shrimp that are caught my dredging the ocean floor (which destroys everything), and no serving of near threatened species."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Ruth's Chris. The food was good but I think due to all the hype and marketing, I expected a little better. I had the ribeye and the meat was a little tough. The sizzling plates and flavor was good. Overall service was excellent."}
{"text":"I know it's expensive.
Very very very expensive
But there is no denying the food is equivalent to the price. I'm an Alberta boy born and raised and I believe Ruth Chris steak is the best in the province. Hot, sizzling, cooked to perfection. Melts in your mouth!
For what it's worth the ahi tuna salad is good and their apple pie is amazing! (I love apple pie)"}
{"text":"If your idea of a good steak involves a trip to the Outback Steakhouse, you should check out Ruth's Chris sometime.  Sure, it's more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  There are better steaks out there (I prefer Delmonico in Vegas), but they are really, really good here (I'd give it a 4.5 if Yelp allowed it).  I think the side dishes are quite tasty, but nothing amazing.

The sizzling butter is a nice touch.  That said, someone once recommend to me that I order my steak with extra butter.   I'd advise against that unless you are at a Ruth's Chris location in close proximity to a hospital.  Extra butter at Ruth's Chris will kill you.  Your steak will swim in butter."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and it was my very fist time to come here and yet i was really, really disappointed and really regret coming here just because of the bad service that we received. I was with my friends and my boyfriend just last sunday to eat dinner and we were assigned to this server named Jessica. At first, she was still okay getting our orders until the time that she asked me what i want. Now since my boyfriend and i will be sharing a big streak, i ordered a calamari and she asked me, \"is this your meal?\". WHAT THE HECK! Why would she ask me if that was my meal? That isnt right. Who cares what i wanna order! So i just let it go. My friend ordered a three course meal. The soup came and then the steak. And then she stopped serving us. The mashed potato which should be with the steak never came until we got the attention of another server and this other server got it for us. Jessica never even bothered to check on us if we are ok. As far as i can remember, if you are a server, you need to ask if everything is okay. Now come on! This is an expensive place! We have to pay our money's worth by having a nice meal with a good service. And still, we kept our cool. We looked around for Jessica and she was only serving like 2 tables and it wasnt even a busy night. I called her to ask for another bread. Guess what? It never came. And then the dessert which should be included with the three course meal? NEVER CAME. So we decided to just pay and ask her for our bill. We called her for it and waited and waited... NEVER CAME. This is really a bad service among all the restaurants that i have dined. And this server is not really happy with her job. We have no choice but to talk to the manager. My friend talked to the manager...(too bad, i forgot his name) but he was really nice to us. He kept on apologizing and even gave us a discount and had our dessert as \"to go\". 

The food was not something to really rave about. But the mashed potatoes were really good. The steak was tender and good as well. The only complaint i had was the bad server named Jessica so if any of you want to eat at this place in Vegas, please ask for another server if they will give you Jessica. I saw the manager talking to her and yet she never came to our table to apologize. 

I would still recommend this place for the food... just because the manager was nice. They better hire good servers... not the jessica type..."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite steak houses. I just like the way they cook their steaks. Especially when you hear it coming to your table sizzling with butter. Yummy! I came here once at 11 PM and I ordered a steak medium rare and it was in front of me in less than fifteen minutes. Wow, such quick service. I also had the au gratin potatoes and it was creamy and cheesy. I also like their shoestring potatoes,tasty and very crispy. They had several ways of cooking spuds and they all looked inviting, too bad I could not order thenm all at once. I have never had bad steak here. Its an old reliable for me."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location three times this year so far, and It is amazing! On my most recent visit, the Assistant Manager, DJ, remembered me and welcomed me back - which is always a \"feel good\" moment for a customer. The hostess noticed that we were wearing dark colors and replaced the white linen napkins with black ones so as \"not to leave white lint all over your outfits,\" (again a nice touch). The waiter, Patrick, was attentive and paid attention to our meal selections and help with recommendations. Our table was next to the window overlooking the walk-way, but we had a great time people watching. Everything was great from our arrival to our departure - I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"$7 Reverse Happy Hour, yes, please!  Awesome drinks and a great value for your money!!"}
{"text":"In a word... solid.

I happened to be in Toronto for work this past weekend, and had a dinner at Ruth's Chris.  We were in the private dining room next to the bar and that was great.  Our waiter was a little brusque, but I would assume that is not the norm.

I had the 22 oz bone-in ribeye, at medium rare.  It was pretty good.  Now I won't call it amazing, but it was a solid 8/10.  Also had the mashed 'taters and big asparagus.  Also had the mixed berries for desert, that was very nice.

We hung out at the bar later and that was a lot of fun, Frazer and Melissa were fun people."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris's does not have a good price/quality ratio. At all. The decor is nice - boring but very acceptable, and the wait staff was excellent. We had a small group lunch and the waiter gave the standard speech about the history of the steakhouse, and proceeded to explain how they only use corn-fed midwestern beef. HELLO? We are the land of excellent grass fed beef here. Cows don't eat corn. It's cruel to them and less tasty for us. There is a host of economic, ethical and political issues with corn fed beef and I kind of wanted to laugh, but refrained at his obvious pride at his spiel.

On to ordering - I got a steak salad, my neighbor a steak sandwich with gumbo, and my other neighbor the mixed platter of chicken encrusted with blue cheese, a small steak, crab cakes and the previously mentioned fried tomato.  My steak was perfectly cooked, very tender and since it rested on a bed of mushrooms did not overcook. It was drenched in previously mentioned butter and had that unmistakable 'off' flavor that US corn-finished beef has. To my taste buds it's a slightly sour undertone rather than the buttery beefy flavor I look for in aged AB beef. The salad was mediocre. Somehow the blue cheese dressing managed to be completely boring with salt as the dominant flavor, and did not mix well with crumbled eggs.

My companion reflected that she prefers her gumbo with actual chunks of seafood, not tiny shreds; the steak sandwich was not open faced but stuffed into a thick roll/bun that was too much bread to steak; the proverbial 8.00 tomato was drenched in sugar and lacked salt, tang or garlic to even it out. It was literally a very sweet concoction sprinkled with a bit of parsley. 

Overall, Ruth Chris's food was entirely overpriced and rather bland, boring and mediocre. For good steak go to Saltlik or Vintage. They're a much better value and way more fun."}
{"text":"Ruth's is one of my fave steak restaurants in the city (a close second to Caesar's) So when I saw that they were participating in Big Taste Calgary it was an great opportunity to have some friends try Ruth's out.

The pre-fixe menu was a choice of salad or soup, a sirloin and dessert. I opted for the Caesar salad, Oscar sirloin and cake. I'm really happy that the quality of the food and service was the same during Big Taste as it would be normally. My steak was great, anytime you have the option to do surf and turf - do it, you'll be so glad you did!

$35 to try out Ruth's is a steal of a deal, and I'm glad my friends love this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak place in Calgary.  Yes better than Caesar's in my opinion.  It's an American chain but a well kept secret in Calgary.  The steak cooks on the plate while you eat it.  Nice dressy ambiance.  Good place to go out for an upscale dinner."}
{"text":"It's okay okay, I find it is overpriced for what it is.  I've eaten at a couple of these in different cities and while they are good I have to repeat it is overpriced for what it is.

I've had a few different cuts and they do cook it perfectly but there is nothing special about the overpriced sides and in many ways I think the only thing that differentiates it from The Keg is price."}
{"text":"The happy hour is amazing. The burger is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Their desserts are amazing also. Love the cheesecake and the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"This steak house always delivers ! 
Great service , great food , great location. 
Book ahead and I recommend the early bird special . 
Nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"No matter what they say about this place, I think the steak is just average, also it's kinda
A hot spot here so it's really crowded with lousy service. Though it's Vegas, food is not really matters!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because I haven't had ruth chris for 4 years. When I finally decided to come back the ribeye steak wasn't as good as before so it wasnt worth the price of $60. That $60 didnt even come with a side,  appetizer,  or a dessert.  So we ordered the 4 course meal which included the a side, appetizer,  main meal and a dessert,  but was disappointed with that also because the portion was very small and it cost us 53.99. The service was good . The negative part is at night my boyfriend and I was sick puking all night but he was fine the next morning but I am still sick for 2 days. I don't think ill be coming back because the food isnt how it supposed to be before and we got food poisoned."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Not as expensive as we anticipated. Best steak ever. Thanks Steve for the great service.   Somehow their meals stay hot to the last bite."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Filet is always amazing and tonight was no exception. The mushrooms are highly recommended to compliment the filet mignon. Their wine selection and the staff is very attentive. This Ruths Chris is one of the best restaurants in downtown Charlotte and every time I have visited, the experience and food have given me multiple reasons to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Ruth's downtown before but this was my first visit to Ruth's in Mississauga. We went because it was my GFs birthday and that's where she wanted to go. I have to say I don't get Ruth's value equation. I consider the Keg a benchmark in the industry. Compared to the Keg the steaks are not as well prepared (little to no seasoning), not as well cooked (pan fried in butter Vs grilled) and do not include side dishes, they are extra. And to top it off Ruth's is more money? Service was good, ambiance was a little on the cheap side, steak was tender and juicy. The mushroom had a canned taste to them. They have a decent wine list including a number by the glass and some half bottles."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Ruth Chris at Southpark during Restaurant Week in July 2014.
Our server was Michael, who had waited on us before and remembered it.  His service was impeccable.  The manager Mr. K. Pace came by our table and introduced himself.  He was very helpful in evey way.  I applaud this steakhouse for it's service, leadership and most of all the delicious steaks....

I highly reccomend this restaurant.

S. Cooper"}
{"text":"Excellent petite filet."}
{"text":"Menu:  Petit Filet, Sides (salad, sautéed mushrooms, asparagus, mashed potatoes), and New Orleans Style Cheesecake with Blueberry Sauce

I went to this Ruth's in Mississauga for a function and I was pleasantly surprised how tender this cut of corn-fed Midwestern beef was, given the amount of people that they had to serve.  We had sixty guests in our room but they were hosting other professional groups equally as large. Great quality control... my steak was medium-rare as requested. The steak and sautéed mushrooms were swimming in butter... which can turn off some, but I shamelessly condoned. The cheesecake was the star of the evening. It had a light and airy texture with a crispy crust. A more than ample serving of blueberry sauce and a few mint leaves were the finishing touches on this lovely dessert!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location of Ruth's on a few occasions and not until this last meal over the weekend have I felt compelled to write a review. I know that this is a chain restaurant and they adhere to certain food standards but when I sat at the bar on Friday night I couldn't help but feel like i was in an upscale McDonald's. The service I received was just okay, not the kind of service that you would receive from a place where you pay $36 for just a steak on a hot plate with some butter... I have eaten at their SouthPark location as well and always felt that their servers were more attentive and polished. These guys should step their game up since there are many other dining options with better service and better food at a lower price in Uptown."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a professional waiter like none other.
Joe Veniegas, Professional Server for Ruth's Chris Steak House at Las Vegas in Harrah's is the most accommodating, conscientious, professional server we have ever experienced because 
of his patience to really connect and understand what his customers are expecting from a Four Star, $$$ Restaurant. You will not be disappointed when you insist on meeting Joe and having him exceed all your expectations of the evening's feast."}
{"text":"I dined at Ruth's Chris with my boyfriend and his parents with a reservation on a Saturday night. Once we were \"checked in\" at the front they seat us in a small dining room to the left with maybe 6 total tables.

Our server Jason seemed as if he was super nervous and white-knuckling it through the evening.  For drink orders he starts with me?  I'm not the guest of honor as well as I'm the least senior at the table. When I'm not ready to order he nicely comes back to me after the other 3 decide.

*What we ordered*

Appetizers:
BBQ shrimp- awesome sauce 
Calamari- sweet chili sauce we request on the side 
Stuffed mushrooms

Salads & soups:
Lobster bisque (yum!)
Caprese (ok)
Caesar salad
French onion soup 

Entrees & sides:
All of us ordered petite filets
Pomme frites
Au gratin potatoes 
Onions
Mushrooms 
Margaux (amazing wine! Which they decant table side) 

Dessert:
Chocolate duo
Coffee

Our appetizers took forever to come out so much so that we started asking about them.  Also when our steaks come out they have 3 petite filets and one petite ribeye... They insisted we ordered it and then when my boyfriends dad said he'd be happy with it they now insist on bringing a filet out.  Also at this time his mom and I ask for forks twice before we can eat our steaks.

By dessert it is clear that Jason is sweating bullets and ready for his shift (life?) to be over.  When he places my coffee down his hand is shaking and the saucer is full of coffee.  We are all used to a great steak dining experience from Ruth's Chris but it was amateur night with no personality, slow timing, and mistakes left and right. 

The food itself was decent but not strong enough to distract the awkward moments and lacking attention to detail.  Sitting in the small side room was dull and I guess easy to overlook by the staff."}
{"text":"I went because I was given a $150 gift certificate. I ordered the steak & lobster combo, steak medium, my wife the salmon. The steak came well done, then it was returned rare - finally it was cooked medium, and the cook personally comped it, which was nice because then the gift cert covered the meal with a decent tip. Get the picture? Also, the lobster was tough. The ambience is ok but crowded, and unless you have a gift certificate or too much money, I can't think of a good reason to burn money here. You can get a comparable steak-lobster combo at a number of other venues at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is delicious! Every item we tried was better than the last! Amazing staff,food and ambiance! Great for romantic dates! A+++++!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place was In March of 08. We went for my 18th birthday.  To be honest I'm a huge steak fan, and when I heard that Ruth's Chris was the best of the best I had to try it. First things first the service was great. Our waitress was on the ball with everything. Then the food. I ordered a New York strip medium rare. The meat was unbelievably tender and full of flavor. I was even able to cut it with a butter knife! No lie this place knows how to tenderize. Then on to the sides, first I tried the garlic mashed potatoes and the texture of the potatoes were excellent!
Had a Great birthday with my family and girlfriend but the only thing was the downside was the bill =/ Around $900 for 12 people"}
{"text":"The bar service was pitifully slow, but it WAS a busy night, so I'll give 'em a by on that one.  The food and food service was outstanding.  Friendly staff, fresh and delicious food.  I'll be back often"}
{"text":"I rarely every write reviews during Charlotte Restaurant Week. However, our experience at Ruth's Chris last weekend was so stellar that a review was definitely warranted!

So Charlotte Restaurant week at Ruth Chris= soup or salad, steak/chicken/fish, side, dessert for $35. What a deal! This is obviously not the normal price.

We arrived and got seated. We had brought in our own wine (pro tip- no corking fee at this location!) and the somm immediately asked us if he could decant it. Yes, please! 

Food: I got the mushroom soup, 8 oz filet mignon, mashed potatoes, and the dessert for the evening (cheesecake with dark chocolate bark). My hubby got the wedge salad, 8 oz filet mignon, mushrooms, and dessert. The soup was ok but the salad was fantastic. They got the good good ranch (everyone knows those places that have the GOOD ranch). Our steaks were cooked perfectly!! Medium rare, like all good steaks should be cooked! Sometimes for Restaurant Week I feel that places give a little smaller or lower quality cuts. However, these steaks were spot on and loaded with sizzling butter! The two sides were good but the steaks were the star. I was so full by dessert that I packaged mine up. However, the chocolate bark was a nice addition to the dessert. Not as filling but still gave you that satisfying sweetness. 

Service: Service was absolutely fantastic. The pace of the evening was perfect for my husband and I to enjoy our bottle of wine and food slowly. Our waiter actually recognized us from a visit over a year ago...thats good! 

Overall fantastic evening, delicious food and wine, and even better company!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for his birthday (we also had a gift card so it kinda helped make our decision!). We typically don't go to super nice restaurants or chains but we decided to do something a bit more fancy for his birthday. 

We had reservations for 7pm. When we arrived we were seated immediately. Fairly quickly, the waiter (Steve) came over and introduced himself and the specials for the night. He was very outgoing! We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizer. A few minutes later he came back and took our order for main food.

Wine: I'm not really a wine snob but I thought the bottle of cab we got was amazing! 

Appetizer: Oso Bucco Ravioli- Delish! There were 5 raviolis that came with this appetizer, along with sauted spinach. The butter/wine sauce was so good! Excellent start to the meal! 

Main Meal: I got the petite sirloin and my husband got some T-bone steak. My steak came out sizziling in butter....500 degrees to be exact.  My husband's steak came out and was the size of his face....no, seriously, it was! Both our steaks were cooked perfectly. At this point in the night, I was in food heaven. Buttery, juicy, melt in your mouth, steak heaven! We got the broccoli au gratin and the mashed potatoes as sides. Definitely plenty for the two of us. The sides were great but the steaks were fantastic! 

Dessert: After finishing our meal and realizing how full we were. We decided dessert was in order....I mean, duh, getting dessert is such an obvious choice after realizing that you are completely suffed!! ;) However, the waiter came out with a white chocolate cheesecake with a candle for my husbands birthday!! It was so sweet that they gave us a free dessert! After the cheesecake, we decided to call it quits. 

The manager (Chris) came by a few times to check in on us, which I thought was a great touch. 

2 hour long delicious meal with wine spending time with my husband on his birthday = perfection!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience a couple floors up on the strip at Harrah's. Food was all around great, lobster Mac and Cheese was great however not my best. Would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Micheal Moosa provided a stellar experience by bussing my table with more style and grace than I have ever seen. I would not have thought it possible to have such a whimsical marriage of form and function when bussing dishes but Micheal Moosa has truly created an art with his line of work."}
{"text":"Malcom our server along with the door staff and bartender all made us feel comfortable, welcome and served up fantastic food and drinks. 
My wife and I over the past 15 years of enjoying steak houses old and new still rank Ruths Chris as our overall consistant favorite. This is our favorite location but our rating includes the many other locations from Hawaii to NY & Florida and San Fran. Thanks RC for being that good.
Friday's dinner consisting of Veal chop and Halibut was very very tasty indeed."}
{"text":"In my opinion (and most people I know who have been there) this is the best steakhouse in Charlotte.

All meat is US Prime, and is cooked in an oven (seasoned with only salt and pepper) then placed on a 500 degree plate with hot butter. The steak is really the best around, in my opinion, FAR surpassing places like Morton's Of Chicago or The Palm, not only in taste, but as well as atmosphere and service.

It is a bit pricey, but it is superb, and for special occasions or business dinners it is the best around. I HIGHLY suggest this restaurant and really can't say enough about it, it's that good.

(For 2 people expect to pay around $90 - $120 [Without wine or other alcoholic beverages])"}
{"text":"We were in town on business and went to Ruth's Chris on Camelback.

Ruth's Chris has a gluten free menu and their service is top notch.  The food was out of this world. Everything from the steaks (melts in your mouth) to the sides and the salads and the desserts. Fantastic! These chefs did not miss a beat and neither did the servers. 

I recommend ordering from the Ruth's classics on the menu. One set price and comes with salad, entree (I had filet and shrimp) sides and dessert. (several gluten free dessert options that were delicious!)

What a wonderful culinary experience!!"}
{"text":"We went for our first wedding anniversary and were very excited to eat a delicious meal. I ordered the Stuffed Chicken and my wife, the Crab Cake entree. The chicken was very good, and it oozed with cheesy goodness. The Crab Cakes were on par, but not quite worth the price. My main source of disappointment was the service. The waiter was very impersonal and didn't seem to value the customer experience. For the price, there are many more places in Vegas that we would have gone to that would give us a true value for the money spent."}
{"text":"The steak actually melted in my mouth. Like beautiful food magic. I literally sigh audibly when I recall eating there!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on multiple occasions and have had all good experiences, except for the one we had yesterday. I'll preface this review with WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION.

My dad found a bug in his salad, I found a hair in my chicken, and the waitress was less than attentive. Of course, the manager was highly apologetic and he comped our salads and dessert. This place understands excellent customer service and the food was superb, as always (after we got past the little speed bumps).

As I said before, we will be coming back to this restaurant because I don't believe in condemning a place because of one less than satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"We use to love this restaurant chain. We travel a lot and always have at least had one dinner, in the city we are in if they have one. We go to Vegas twice a year and were surprised last year when we went. This one is inside Harrah's, you take an elevator up and when the doors open it is really nice, clean and impressive. The steaks are fantastic as everything else is too, even the bread is good to eat while waiting for your meal.  It was our anniversary we were celebrating so we decided on a really good meal, you will easily spend over a hundred dollars for two to have dinner. All sides are separate but generous enough for you to share. There is a good view of Caesar's Palace and the lights of the strip. It was a good evening till the check arrived. I tried to use two $25.00 gift cards from \"Ruth Chris\". The waiter said he took off $25.00 but the second card had no money on it which was kind of embarrassing for me. I think they believed since we were tourists we would just throw the card away. When we got home I made some calls and found out the card was used on the date we ate there and the location. I called the restaurant and explained what had happened and what I had discovered. A few days later the assistant manager called and got my e-mail address to conclude what he found. He confirmed the card was cashed in at his restaurant but no credit given to me. He agreed to give us our $25.00 that was stolen and $10.00 for our trouble and left it at that. This was no mistake, the waiter stole $25.00 from us, He ran the card took the money and told us it was no good. I believe they should have given us the entire dinner for free once they discovered they had a thief. I sent my concerns to Ruth Chris corporate and the Casino's corporate only to get blown off. Who would have thought a classy place like this would be running scams on tourists, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We came here for restaurant week.

Can I just say the layout of the parking lot is beyond silly. I don't know if they're trying to be fancy by not having lines of parking spaces, instead choosing to place the spots by sprinkling them throughout the place. We had to park way out by the Taco Bell lot. Plowing the lot must be a nightmare.

For $35 you got a salad, or soup, petite filet, an accompaniment, and a dessert of your choosing.

It was a Friday and they weren't particularly busy for a Friday, or for Restaurant Week. It also happened that we made a reservation through their online system and were able to get seated within 5 minutes of arrival.

Oddly we were provided a bread basket before we had water at our table. The bread, while soft and spongy, we still required water to help it down. To our relief, it came after we were two helpings in. The bread was warm, but otherwise not memorable. It came with plain, whipped butter. I will say that Fleming's has a slight advantage over Ruth's on this aspect.

I opted for the Caesar salad because our main server (like other fine dining steakhouses, you get a main server leader and a slew of minions) didn't mention what the soup option was that night.

The salad arrived already tossed and dressed with large shavings of Parmesan cheese and delightfully airy, but flavorful croutons. A large black pepper grinder was offered to dust it all off.

Medium Well here means still pink in the middle. The filet arrived on a hot plate, still sizzling, making the sweat juices from the steak dance. I chose mashed potatoes for a side and instead of being on the plate, it came in it's own gravy boat-esq dinnerware. It had a hint of garlic with a not too fine consistency, in other words - perfect. The steak was amazing! Had an outer layer crust of black peppercorn and sea salt. Cooked to perfection, it had a slight hue in the middle but was not bloody. I would guess it was about 5 oz which at first thought would be much too small for my appetite, but I was incorrect. Savoring each bite of the melty meat allowed me to enjoy my meal in its entirety. 

We left fully satisfied with both the food as well as the fact that our wallet wasn't worse for wear."}
{"text":"My wife and I are old time Ruth's Chris fans.  Our main restaurant was the Flamingo location in Las Vegas.  It closed about four years ago along with the other location on Paradise road.  We visited other locations in New York, Phoenix, 3 in Florida and Savannah.  We go because we know what to expect & are rarely disappointed; until last night.  This was our anniversary, so we decided to brave the Strip and visit the location at Harrah's.  We had visited this location once before & it was fine.  However, last night's visit started fine.  We decided to eat at the bar, which we've done many times at other locations.  Ron, the bartender, was excellent & treated us very well.  My 2 favorite dishes are the lobster bisque & the shoestring fries.  The lobster bisque was just okay.  Not very warm and not very tangy which I had come to expect.  Ordering the shoestring fries, I was informed that it was no longer served at this location.  Ron informed us that many customers from out of town regularly ask for this dish and are disappointed to find it is not offered. I don't understand this.  I checked and it's still on the menu at other location's.  On top of this, we ordered the classic cut fries & they were limp and ordinary.  So, no more Ruth's Chris Las Vegas because you just became ordinary."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is a review a year in the making as I actually visited Ruth Chris- Southpark last year for restaurant week and was reminded of my experience since that time has come around again this year. I was really excited to visit this place for the first time as Ruth Chris franchise is very well known and I'm a steak and potatoes guy at heart. So I figured I'd give a classy steakhouse a try seeing how I had pretty much tried in the middle of the road ones you can try (longhorn,outback, texas roadhouse etc) My date and I and reservations for a Sunday evening so getting seated was not an issue. There was a fairly good amount of people there as you would expect for the first evening of the special menu, but it wasn't bursting at the seams busy. However, the sluggish service throughout the whole dining experience felt like their staff couldn't handle the extra foot traffic. I had allotted a good amount of stomach space for this meal so I wasn't really happy with living off plain ol bread and water for what seemed like an eternity.  Their restaurant weekend menu wasn't really impressive once you tasted and viewed the seemingly reduced portions they were dishing out. Anything worth having really required an \"upgrade\" which really defeats the purpose of getting a quality experience at a 30 per person price point. The appetizers made it to us not very long after the entrees. We really didn't start eating until maybe 45 minutes after we had sat down. The ribeye I had wasn't bad by any means, but I was certainly not blown away by it and actually got bored with it before I finished. If I hadn't tanked up on bread and water I doubt it would have felt like a filling meal. The cheesecake desert was just a little sliver just enough to quench  a sugar fix but it was very forgettable. Maybe it was just an off night which sucks because I wanted to love this place so bad and it has many positive reviews. I just can't see myself going out of my way to visit a Ruth Chris restaurant again and pay premium prices when I've easily had better steak experiences at other places."}
{"text":"We are back! Again, we picked this dinner among all the restaurants choices in Vegas(were not even locals). And yet again, their steak was spot on to our sizzling, gastronomic delight! I gave 4 stars because the mashed potatoes were a little overseasoned.  Come on, you can do better than that guys! Weve eaten at other upscale steak restaurants but it's true what they say when it comes to steak, THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The service is great and the food is amazing. Best steak I've ever had. Expensive but really good."}
{"text":"This basement window-less  location is positively choking with people on expense accounts consuming thick slabs of sizzling over-priced steaks.  You get to it via a street-level elevator a la parking garage style.  
 
Julia Child said that , \"If you have enough butter, anything is good,\" so be it for the hunks of butter drenched  beef served here .  I was given a  bib to wear to prevent grease splatters on my clothing. 

Long time Toronto residents,  the BigK and I were mistaken for tourists, just like many of the other customers here and our waiter, in between courses, made many suggestions for after dinner entertainment.  We just let him prattle on.  

Much time was spent de-crumbing our table.  Side orders were as ridiculously over-priced as the mains. My pommes frites were cold and dry.   The BigK loved his New York Strip.  We had after-dinner drinks at the bar and I felt like I was back in the 1960's in a Don Mills rec-room ."}
{"text":"I'll give it you, Ruth. You figured out the perfect business model: Dare to charge opulent prices for an 'exclusive experience' and everyone's gotta have it. Hell, I did. I wanted that exclusive 500 degree sizzling plate people 'ooh and ahh' over. Gotta be honest. I remember more about burning my thumb on that plate than I do the steak. My $59 hockey-puck-sized petite filet was in fact, perfectly cooked and bursted of buttery carniverous delight. So you won there, Ruth. Oddly, the flavor I remember most is the nuked rubbery seaweed flavored shrimp resting atop such a beautiful cut of roast beast. The salad and sides were good, but not memorable. Same w the creme brulee.

Unfortunately, I can't find a true hero in the Ruth's Chris experience. There's nothing I can say about this place, be it the vibe, service or food that justify the price. Especially since you can, (with a quick Google-search and some tenacity), learn how to make a steak surpisingly comparable to Ruths for 1/2 the cost. If you know this, you walk away feeling a bit duped, even a little angry. 

The server's had sold me on the fact that the beef we were about to eat is the top 3% in America. In all fairness to Ruth, there's simply no way to give the time and attention required to make every steak great and pump them all out in a night. Ruth knows you don't understand this. Thats why they've got you in their restaurant. The guy sitting next to me got the most expensive cut on the menu (the $100 cowboy ribeye) and offered me a bite (It damn near burned my mouth it was so hot.) The number 1 food crime in America is not letting your steak rest before served. How could u do this to a man who just paid $100 bucks for a slice of cow? And I hate saying this but it tasted so damn....average. Not even half as good as the $27 ribeye I got at Pappy's way out in the desert. 

After all the great things I've heard Ruth. We gotta talk."}
{"text":"Delicious t-bone, cooked perfectly. Chop salad is a must. Bob, our server, did a great job."}
{"text":"Love, love love this place. In the few times I have been here I have never had a bad steak and the service is above all of the rest. Yes it is a bit expensive but well worth the money in my opinion with the quality of the steak cuts, service and the deserts take it over the top.

The management here is always available in the dining room and make it a point to come by at least once during your meal to make sure that you are pleased with the service and meal. I cant say enough about this place, it is a great place for taking that special someone to spend that little extra on to show them how much you love and appreciate them."}
{"text":"Great service & ambience.  Great tasting food. My husband and I shared crab stuffed mushrooms, lobster bisque, the cowboy bone-in rib eye steak, scalloped potatoes & asparagus with Hollandaise sauce & a bottle of pinot noir. AMAZING food & special evening. Expensive but well worth it! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on July 1st, Canada Day. I was super hungry and tired from walking around all day, and didn't feel like getting burgers/hotdogs from food trucks. So, this upscale steakhouse was where I ended up. Imagine my surprise when I found out that their average entree was like $95!!! *gasp* I came pretty close to bolting for the door (wasn't exactly planning on a $100 dinner:p), but then I discovered a neat Prix Fixe menu: standard 3-course meal, with shrimp+steak as one of the mains, all for a total of $55. The combination of seafood, steak, and exhaustion really got to me, so I dived right in.
For appetizer I had tomato crab bisque (vs 2 diff salads). It came warm, I would've preferred my soup hotter. The flavor was spot-on, the combination of tomato and spices really brought out the texture. A bit on the strong side though, so I decided to wait for the bread before finishing up. Which took another 15min (and my soup wasn't getting any hotter), but it proved all worth the wait. The bread was definitely the highlight of the evening -- more specifically, the BUTTER. I've never had butter that tasted so amazing before!!!! It was light, fluffy, so fresh that I swear it came straight from farm to table! Simply delicious.
The steak+shrimp came on a sizzling hot plate. I mean they literally put the plate in the oven! With the steak on it! How crazy is that? Both the steak and shrimp were fresh, with decent seasoning (did have to ask for salt&pepper though), and neither were overcooked which was a huge plus for me. But in the end, it just wasn't that special. You could probably get the material from Costco's for a fraction of the price, cook at home and have it done to your perfection. And it would have been just as (if not more) enjoyable. 
Desert was an epic fail. The almonds tasted foul (although my server promised me it was fine). I took like two bites and refused to take the rest of it home. I mean come on! I get that it's complementary, but they should at least put an effort into making it edible! (Or take it off the menu and make it two-course, I'm indifferent.) Got a drink on the side which was $20 (total rip off), but I was thirsty and felt like alcohol and it was Canada Day!!! So all in the name of festivity:)
Overall it was wayyy too pricey for a neighborhood diner, and the food quality was just that. The butter was the only thing I would gladly pay for, totally worth 1 star (or 2) on its own. The restaurant was underground and dim-lit, so not the kinda place you can expect instagram-worthy pictures from. If I were to return, it would probably be for the butter alone."}

Will tell friends and FOR SURE return"}
{"text":"The booth was very uncomfortable if you go request a table. The Porterhouse was the best I have ever had and the sweet potato was simply the best. Just can't stress enough get a table ."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food!  The 11 oz filet was cooked to perfection.  My fiancé had the 8 oz filet and she said the same.  We also had the au gratin potatoes which were great.  The sides feed two.  The chocolate explosion was also very good.  Be prepared to spend a pretty penny...it's worth it in our minds."}
{"text":"The best steaks in Canada. More on the formal side of restaurants. Staff remind me of the elite butler. \"If you insist Madam\". Friendly staff. Nice music. Bread is very soft, fresh and tastes great.
The potato gratin was sooo good.
Free wifi, which the waiter assists in putting in.
Great for celebrations and occasions."}
{"text":"Loved Ronald, our bartender. The happy hour was fabulous and the service even better!! Thanks, Ronald!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I dont get why people complain about the prices when they should have known that ruth chris is an upscale restaurant so it shouldnt be a shock.

My boyfriend and I both order salads to start off with, filet for him and ribeye for me. We also ordered mash potatoes and green beans and my boyfriend ordered 2 drinks. Our bill came out to be around $150 excluding tip.

The salads were just salads.. not many ways to make a salad but I really enjoyed the Champagne Vinaigrette (it's not listed on the menu). My boyfriend and I both ordered our steaks medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I usually like my steaks almost medium but I figured since ruth chris is known for serving their steaks on 500 degree hot plates, medium rare would be the best choice. The quality of both steaks was worth every penny. My steak was a little over salted but the quality of the steak was so amazing, I didnt really care but i would ask next time to take it down a notch with the salt. lol 

Now, this is the main reason why I wanted to write the review. Ive been to places like Fahrenheit and Capital Grille and the service there was nothing compared to the service we received at Ruth Chris. I regret not being able to catch his name but he was incredible. When I asked him where the restroom was he was nice enough to walk me that way. And I put my napkin on my seat before I left to the bathroom and when I came back it was neatly folded on the table. He even took our valet ticket and had them pull our car up by the time we walked out of the restaurant. Our glasses were never empty and he checked up on us enough to not interrupt our dinner. Just little details that I really appreciated."}

the steak sandwich is excellent.

{"text":"Simply the best steak my wife and I have ever had. The service was fast and friendly. The steak was cooked to perfection. Just be prepared for the price tag. The restraunt provides an excellent fine dinning experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here maybe a half dozen times with the hope that the next time would be better.....unfortunately never happens. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, it just isn't great and at these prices it should be. The service is top notch but the steaks are not.  I was in New York last summer and had an almost religious experience dining on a bone in filet mignon at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steak house. Have also dined at Morton's which was exceptional. I would put Ruth Chris on par with the Keg....just triple the price."}
{"text":"We usually prefer elsewhere for our steak cravings, but had a gift card and heard great things about their happy hour, so we gave it a try!
We were very happy with our service and the food was really great!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was really excited about having dinner here tonight, I had very high expectations for this place. But my experience wasn't all that good. The restaurant was very classy and the staff were all very nice and helpful. We were seated very quickly and we got a strip view which was pretty dope. Our server came right over and took our drink orders, we ordered appetizers which came out pretty fast. The appetizers were pretty much the highlight of our meal. We had the spicy lobster which was very good and the calamari that was just as good. And then our entrees came and the whole thing went south on us. I had the 16oz Ribeye which wasn't great at all, the steak was cooked ok but it was lacking flavor. My wife ordered the 20oz lobster which was huge but it was overcooked. I was not impressed with my steak at all, I my have ate about 1/4th if it. I couldn't believe how weak my steak was. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. I'm giving them 2 stars for our service and the view"}
{"text":"Wonderful steak, no questions asked. Service was outstanding. The price is definitely not an every Friday night kind of place but it's a great place for special events. We very much enjoyed the chop salad, and mashed potatoes. We also had an order of the broccoli au gratin but were fairly disappointed with it. Steaks were wonderful and I had a delicious blueberry mojito."}
{"text":"Probably the worst most expensive steak I've had. Overpriced & zero flavour!
If I didn't ask for the peppercorn sauce on the side it would've been tasteless!!"}
{"text":"Absurd prices, absurdly small portions.  I cannot explain how this place stays in business.  The waiter, despite his tux, was a total hick.  \"Y'all want me to clean up some of them crumbs fer y'all?\"  With a couple of drinks and dessert, 1 person can easily rack up a $100 tab.  I've had better steaks at IHOP."}
{"text":"This is such an elegant restaurant with an amazing menu. Every single bite of food is cooked to perfection. I must say I don't eat red meat so I order the salmon and it's so yummy and simply cooked. Not a lot of seasoning or flavor, in fact I think it just salt pepper and butter with lemon as a garnish. I also really love their drink menu- good variety. 
Ask for the wine room if you're celebrating or having a romantic evening!"}
{"text":"Having had a chance to be in numerous Ruth Chris establishments including the original New Orleans steakhouse in addition frequenting all the other great steakhouses across the USA.. I realize I expect  a lot compared to the average patron.
So a little disappointed to rate this st only three stars.. First I stopped in about 5 as I am traveling off east coast  and while the bar was full hostess rest of house was empty .. as I ask for 1 the hostess said st least an hour for the bar did not even suggest a table.. so said I would try latter ... so returned about an hour latter and just told them  party of one they said well it would be 8:00pm .   Just told them would wait and just felt they were annoyed.. first time out of probably 60 it 70 visits over the years I did not fill welcomed.. ( this was my first trip to the Scottsdale Ruth Chris) wanted about 3o minutes and a bar table opened up. I noticed a party of 3 came in without a reservation and was seated almost immediately ..so had to assume they were busy and really did not want to waste a space on a single .. even that this single travels over 150 nights a year for many years eat alone often. Beside this the server was great. The steak was cooked perfectly but the quality seemed not up to normal Ruth Chris I expected. The real letdown was the garlic mash potatoes ... basically a ripoff Luke warm   No garlic  and almost grainy like out of a box .. not $11 dollar side. Normally don't do the mash at RC but just in the mood and expected a lot more quality for the $.   So probably my most disappointment ever with a Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"It's hard to compete in the steakhouse industry especially when located at the heart of downtown Toronto. Maybe that's why Ruth Chris sells gift cards at Costco? 

I was not impressed with the service - the hostess was not as welcoming as other steakhouses and our server was a bit of a grump. Our bread arrived when our steaks  arrived.. so much for calling it starter bread.. 

The bacon-wrapped scallops we ordered as the appetizer was smaller than the ones I've tried, and the bacon was overly-salted. 

I know it's their style, but I'm just not a fan of my steak served in a sizzling hot plate that's making my medium-rare steak into a medium. They also coat their steaks with butter to add more flavor? As usual, I ordered the filet mignon and it was not tender at all. 

The interior of the restaurant is way too dark - people with astigmatism will not be able to see what they're eating and remember to turn on the flash if you want to snap some pictures. Ruth Chris may present themselves as a high-end restaurant, but it's so loud inside, you might as well be in Swiss Chalet on a Friday night. 

This is just my experience at this location, but I've had fantastic meals in the Ruth Chris in Asia. You need to step up your game, Ruth."}
{"text":"I love Ruth Chris' and I would've given this 5 stars but server Lawrence had a pissy demeanor. For me to have to ask if we can order drinks and scrape the table of crumbs is unacceptable for Ruth Chris. Luckily my Strip was the bomb. Management please talk to Lawrence and don't make the assumption 3 guys in their 20's don't deserve to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"What can I say. It's Ruth's Chris! What I love is that no matter what location we visit in whatever city we go to we always receive great service and delicious food. The dining room at this Vegas Strip location is much nicer than the location they had on Paradise. We arrived on time for our reservation and we were greeted and seated right away. Our waiter was attentive and overall provided good service. You can never wrong with a buttery delicious filet or their stuffed chicken breast."}
{"text":"All Ruth Chris are not equal, but this one was exceptional.  Attentive fast service.  Excellent, steak, I had bone-in filet, cooked as I ordered.  Just great evening."}
{"text":"I had the NY steak. It was very tasty. My wife had the   Filet Mignon, my kid had BBG shrimp.  Food and service was great. We would come back. We have eaten at other locations."}
{"text":"This location has great service. There was a deal for a glass of Rose and filet & shrimp for $30. Paige at the bar was very friendly & accommodating."}
{"text":"The biggest surprise for me is that, even after venturing to many high-end steakhouses, this is still one of the best."}
{"text":"I have my favorite high end steakhouse in Madison and since I live on the East Side I would normally never opt to come here but my fiance received a gift card so we decided to drive across town and check it out. We sat in a booth at the bar because we like the bar better no matter where we may be. The service was great, the bartenders had a heavy pour (YAY), and the calamari appetizer was fantastic. However, the most surprising and exciting thing to me (that would make me come back) was the prix fixe dinner options they had. I asked the waitress, is this really available on Thursday? I figured it would be a Monday night only thing or something to get customers in the door on a typically slow night. Nope, she told me it was available 7 days a week 365 days a year. I was stunned. The menus offered full salads, an entree (one of the choices being what I planned to order anyway), a full side, and a duo of desserts for $45-50 per person. I have never seen anything like it at a \"high end steakhouse\" at least not available all year round! Of course both of us ordered that option and were happy and stuffed from our meals!"}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris. The food, The service, The decor. I love it. I've been there a bunch of times now, and it's always consistent.

Food Quality: The food is always wonderful here, whether it be steak, or seafood (or anything else on the menu I'm sure). I've tried both steak and seafood dishes. One thing worth mentioning though, is the price. Ruth's Chris is awfully expensive, and best saved for special occasions. I've had both the filet, and the New york strip, both of them were excellent, but I'd recommend the strip. As far as the appetizers go my favorite would be the crab cakes. They're huge and delicious (almost like two tennis balls) but again the price is pretty high.

Service: The service you'd expect at a fine dining institution. Waiters checking up on you frequently, refilling your water, bringing your bread. The food has also come out in a timely manner every time. The servers are always quite polite. There's nothing that I've found necessary to complain about in this category.

Decor: Nice decor, for a nice evening. The decor isn't incredible, it won't jump out at you. The decor is best summed up as nice. That's all.

Great place for surf or turf, give it a go if you're looking to burn some cash."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. It's so consistent which is something I value knowing that my steak is always going to be amazing. On our most recent visit, I got the filet with bone-in and it was top notch. Flavorful and tender. We started off with a Caesar salad that was a refreshing start. Then along with main dish we also got the sweet potatoes casserole which was a 10. My wife loved her stuffed chicken and the dessert put a bow on an amazing night!  Perfect dinner!"}
{"text":"We were at Ruth Chris Saturday night we ordered our drinks and in the meantime we ordered appetizers we were waiting for a friend for drinks. our friend came and we still waited finally I asked the waiter what up with our appetizers??? Jesus is soup and shrimp....
come Dinner same thing the wait continued...
The manager Finally came at the when we got our steaks..but should didn't really jump and and say what can I do to make this right. She kinda left the lingering hmmmm sorry this is your night. I have worked in a very busy steakhouse before and the manager would always jump in and save the experience of the guest.
We must always remember that we are all customers some where and when you are paying top dollar you expect to be taken care of. In any economy people decide whether business will stay open so they should always be in in communication to be on there top game.
We have many choices in the resturaunt business"}
{"text":"Special occasion anniversary dinner.
Had to wait 30 minutes for waiter to arrive at table.
Ordered a Tomahawk Rib  Eye for two at $119.00.
The steak was about 60% fat. My wife could not eat her half.
Complained to the Maitre d' who told us that's what makes the steak good.
Then he said I received the portion my wife should have gotten and then 
promptly disappeared for the evening. On the positive side the side dishes
were excellent. The wine was top notch and the bartender was wonderful.
However we didn't go there to drink and have mushrooms and mash potatoes.
A very disappointing evening overall and we will not return to this restaurant.

{"text":"$250 dinner for 3. Price is not the issue but Worst service ever! Completely subpar and will not return. Think twice before coming here"}
{"text":"Things have changed for the worst.  Haven't eaten there in a few years, and I remember it being great, a rare treat.  I don't eat meat but loved the salmon in the past.  This time it seemed like Atlantic farmed salmon, did not look or taste wild-caught.  It was tender and edible but had very little flavor. I didn't ask the source, but found some other comments on line by other diners disappointed that it wasn't wild-caught.  Friend ordered steak, and he reported it to be quite ordinary but good.  The mashed potatoes are nothing special.  Won't eat there again at these prices.  There are restaurants with better food at half the price."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service from waitstaff, but a 25-minute wait for my reserved table? (Excuse = the table is being \"reset\" the entire time.) Four hostesses and no one helps with the front door? Pffft."}
{"text":"We recently visited The Restraunt a few months ago. We are avid Ruth's Chris frequenters, but this was our first time at the Scottsdale location. Upon seating I quickly asked our waitress if she could take a picture of our table for my parents anniversary. Very rudely she replied \"we have someone that comes around to each table to take a picture so just wait for that\". Without skipping a beat she made her way to the table next to us which clearly appeared to be her regulars snapped their picture and chatted away. My father also cut himself on his glass slicing his lip, in which she nonchalantly   apologized and walked away to get a manger who apologized and brought another drink. After nearly an hour and a half I reminded the waitress I would like a picture for the anniversary and she rolled her eyes as she went to find someone to take the picture. My father kindly tipped the waitress 30% on our 375$+ meal and chalked it up to her having a bad day and not how the restaurant operates as a whole. Very disappointing for a special day."}
{"text":"***Yelp Challenge 2016 15/100***

You have to be a carnivorous dinosaur to eat here or turn back around and take yourself to Sweet Tomatoes and have a salad LOL

The views of the strip on a candle lit table is the best part. We started off with the chopped salad after eating all the bread in the basket. The was then followed by a New York Steak and Filet Mignon. They cooked it in butter and the steaks were soo juicy and tender. 

My opinion of the steaks. it was ok. I've had better around town. The only reason I came here was because I had a free voucher from our stay at HGVC."}
{"text":"I didn't expect for the food to be so good especially at a franchise type steak house. Slate, our server was very attentive and provided excellent service. If you want a cocktail I reckoned the coconut ginger lemon drop... Delicious!"}
{"text":"We went here because we had a $100 gift certificate. I've always heard good things about this place so I was anxious to try it. I knew it was typically very pricey but the website showed a new menu that paired salad, entree and dessert for a more reasonable price. Unfortunately, this menu was unavailable the night we went. I started off with a Steak House salad with the Lemon basil dressing. It was quite good. For my meal I ordered the Creole crab topped filet. My husband got the regular filet and we shared a side dish of Lyonnaise potatoes. My steak was seriously over salted not to mention dripping in butter. My husband said his steak, as well as the potatoes were over salted as well. Call me crazy but I think if you can charge $35 for an ala carte steak then it should be absolutely amazing on it's own without a need for salt or butter (or minimal). When the waitress asked how things were I was nice but honest in that it wasn't fabulous. The manager came over and tried to appease us and even offered to send me home with a new steak. I graciously declined but they delivered us each a \"complimentary\" dessert. It was some kind of berry topped cheesecake and was probably the highlight of the meal. When the bill came I noticed that I was overcharged for my steak as well as the two glasses of wine. I purposely ordered the least expensive wine because at $10 a glass I figured it still had to be pretty good. At that point we didn't want to cause more problems so we just paid it. Overall, I was definitely underwhelmed and will not return. The service was very good but even with $100 gift card it still cost us over $50. There is no way the food was close to worthy of those prices. At least I can check that one off my list."}
{"text":"Steak literally melted in my mouth....words cannot explain the joy! Mashed potatoes were super buttery and delicious also enjoyed their cheesecake. I will say the lobster mac was kinda whatever."}
{"text":"what a disappointment I have been to many steak houses that are so mush better had orders a Moscow mule that was not one that I ever had I think it was a margarita but what ever the service was not up to standard for this caliber restaurant did not recognize my brothers birthday after I told the hostess water spilled on the table ever time and the steak was just OK will not go back"}
{"text":"Have to lower my typical review rating for Ruth's Chris. The Scottsdale Seville location is unbelievable for the food, but they discontinued carrying the best vodka - Stoli Elit - and now I won't be able to enjoy a steak with my Martini. What a let down!"}
{"text":"I took my staff there for a company party. The table was set up in such a way that it was impossible to talk to the person across from you because there were TWO tables between you. Thought it was odd until I saw the bill, which was crazy high with alcohol. A lot of my guests are non-drinkers, so the number of bottles of wine that I was charged for was outrageously high for the remaining few guests. After the first round of drinks, which the servers authorized with me, I was not consulted again. Either the servers kept bringing out bottles for the very far side of the table without consulting me, or even without a direct guest request, or they severely miscounted. After dozens of parties at other high-end restaurants in the past, I have never before experienced this problem. Discussions with management were not successful. I will NOT ever be back. Be wary."}
{"text":"I first rated Ruth's  Chris a couple years ago. I didnt understand one bit why it was well rated,  as that particular meal was a sea of salt served on a plate.

Since then , I have had a few friends ask me to join them at Ruth's Chris. At first, I begrudgingly agreed to go. After the first revisit, I have visited a few times and realized my original visit was a poor roll of dice.

I've had ribeyes and bone-in filets. The meats are advertised prime, and they taste prime: tender and juicy. Perfectly cooked every time. The sides are also very enjoyable. We got the lobster mac and cheese multiple times, impressed by the depths of flavor and the subtle taste of a chopped up green chili.

The service is always good as well. 

This is one of those times where I am glad I gave a restaurant a second shot. I would give them four stars if my first visit wasn't so poor."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! Great birthday present!! I really enjoyed the layout and so did my husband!"}
{"text":"Got the filet with a side of Mac and cheese. Steak was cooked very well, tried to be a little too fancy with the Mac just needed to keep it simple. All in all good would have just gone to the keg if I had a choice."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I have eaten at a Ruth's Chris before. I've eaten at the one in Denver and the one in San Diego. This one blew those two out of the water. The service was unlike anywhere I have ever eaten. By far the best service experience I have ever had. Adam was our server and he said he was new to the Ruth's Chris here in Vegas but that he had worked for the company for many years. This definitely showed he answered every question we could come up, we even tried to stump him but to no avail.  He kept us laughing and entertained throughout our entire dining experience.  He was very funny and charming really loved engaging with him. 

Now on to the food WOW just WOW. Adam recommended the Spicy Lobster and it was unbelievable. Kind of reminded me of a bang bang shrimp from Bonefish but much better. Then I had the Cowboy Ribeye oscar style and my wife had the filet oscar style. Adam said it was the only way to have a steak with the crab cake and bernaise sauce, and boy was he right. Was easily the best steak i've ever had. Adam also suggested the sweet potato casserole, I'm not even a big fan of sweet potato, but this dish was unbelievable. It was like a desert. My wife and I really enjoyed our experience all in all, we loved Adam and will definitely ask for him when we come in again, as should you. Ruth's Chris really went above and beyond great great experience. Thank you to everyone there. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Serivce was great.  There for an anniversary.  Everyone went over the top to say congrats.  Now...prices and food.  Ruths, in my opinion, has gone way downhill in quality over the years.  For $43 my steak better be off the charts great.  It wasn't.  Both the fliet and ribeye were mediocre at best.  Salad was bland.  The calimari, in a Thai chili sauce, was quite nice though.  
Doubt I'll be back to any Ruths anytime soon, unless a wealthy benefactor is footing the bill.  $150 for two steaks, an app, a salad, one potato au gratin (very dissapointing) and two glasses of wine.  Plenty of other high end places at the same or less of a price point wtih better meat.  Again, just one person's opinion but I do eat at steak places worldwide on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose to have our 19th wedding anniversary dinner at Ruths Chris and we were not disappointed. The steaks were top notch and we loved the sweet potato pie side. Service was above and beyond which completed the perfect experience. I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for an evening to remember."}
{"text":"This is still my very favorite place for steak!  This location has big windows with views of buildings on the strip. Food is awesome!  Filet is the best. Also love the au gratin potatoes!  Service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the best experience I've ever had at a steakhouse.

I'm a bit disappointed in myself that I haven't visited this Ruth's Chris location sooner. While planning a friend's going-away party this past Saturday (as of this writing), the group decided on Ruth's Chris as a classy venue. Although I wasn't quite sold on it after reading the Yelp reviews, we decided to plunge ahead anyway and see how things played out.

The experience was incredible from start to finish. Having reserved a table for 8 PM, my best friend and I arrived around 6:45 PM to find an 18-seat table already set up for our use. Despite waiting around for an hour-and-a-half coordinating guests and ensuring that everyone arrived on time, the waiters were incredibly helpful and were by multiple times to ask us if we needed anything. Right off the bat, I could tell that this was going to be a special experience.

The restaurant itself is classy and full of little touches. We were in a semi-private room near the back of the restaurant, and we had access to lighting controls and spacious seating. The ambiance of the restaurant is a bit dark, but it plays with very well with the atmosphere and feels very warm and intimate. We also met the general manager, Jesse, who was around multiple times throughout the evening to make sure we were being taken care of and any questions were answered.

Nearly everyone in our group went for the Taste of Spring special ($55.95), which came with a choice of salad, one of three entrees (steak and shrimp, chicken or salmon), a choice of side and bread pudding/coconut-infused chocolate for dessert. I don't believe I'm being facetious or over-the-top when I say the meal is one of the best I've had in years. The pictures don't even do it justice.

I ended up going for the BLT butter lettuce salad (my first time having to \"cut\" a salad with a knife), the steak done medium-rare and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! The salad actually tasted like a BLT sandwich, packed full of cheese and bacon bits. The steak was cooked to perfection and arranged with the shrimp on top (as you can see below, I ended up taking off one of the shrimp before remembering to take a photo), the mashed potatoes were buttery-smooth and the bread pudding is probably the best I've had in a long time, if ever.

Service was also A-plus. Our waiters were constantly checking up on us, making sure that our drinks were full and our dishes were brought as promptly as possible. When one of my friends was forced to wait for her entree to arrive last (due to the plate breaking because of the heat), the servers brought a new side for her and were prompt to make sure she was taken care. A+ service across the board.

Yes, this is a bit of a pricier option - for 18 of us, we collectively paid just over $1,400. Yet the experience was worth every dollar, full of the touches you would find at any AAA restaurant in Toronto. The blue exterior of the building this steak house resides in betrays a classy, warm, inviting place that has been one of the best experiences I've had in quite some time. It made the event incredibly memorable and everyone agreed that this would be a place we would revisit in the future.

Highly, highly recommended. Put this restaurant on your bucket list to visit, and make sure you dress up for it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have great food, wine, and the staff is super friendly. It is a little pricey but it is worth every penny! Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything about our dinner at this restaurant was great, from the service, to the ambience, to the decor, to the food. 

The service was friendly and on the ball. Our server was pleasant, as was the lady who assisted him throughout. 

The lighting here is different from the Ruth's Chris locales I've been to in California, but I thought it was great. The place has an old-man's steakhouse feel to it. Dimly lit and paneled in dark wood throughout, I could easily see the Rat Pack dining here after a show. 

The food, as expected, was excellent. My filet was delicious, well-seasoned and juicy and tender. My fiancee ordered the Stuffed Chicken, which is a half-chicken stuffed with cheeses and herbs. I thought she was crazy for ordering chicken at Ruth's, but the dish was awesome. The flavors in the cheese/herb mix were amazing, and the chicken itself was tender and juicy. 

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Sin Cake. If you like chocolate this is the dessert to get. Enough said. 

This place is open 'til 3 AM, but you might want to make reservations to be on the safe side. I found the location a bit odd (it's in the middle of a strip mall), but other than that, an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for my Birthday and service was awesome!  Food is amazing too.  They really treated me like I was special.  Was even able to meet the Chef, which is a great thing.  There was not one bad thing I can say about my experience here."}
{"text":"Be aware that they do not sell gift cards at this location.  There is nothing on their website indicating this.  It simply says that \"Ruth's Chris Steak House gift cards can be purchased on our website, in person at any of our Ruth's Chris locations \".  So if you find a place to park, walk through Harrahs, wait for them to open, then take the elevator to the restaurant, you will be told you are out of luck! We wanted to purchase one for a wedding gift - so frustrating!  I'm giving them one star because the cashier was so snippy about it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hit or miss. Overall, an underwhelming experience from start to finish, but to their credit the steak was quite good. Three stars is for the steak -- everything else was just okay.

I got the steak/shrimp combo item, which included soup, side, main course, and dessert for $44. What I received was worth about $30, in my opinion. The gumbo was decent, but was more liquid than veggies or meat. 

Next was over 1 hour of waiting for our food; when we asked the waiter about the long wait, he said, \"We wait between courses to serve the next item.\" Really? Over an hour? Oddly, the restaurant was less than half full during our visit, which added to our confusion.

My side -- sweet potato cassarole, of sorts -- was good, but required a $4 up-charge. The steak was great, perfectly cooked and tender...I found myself wishing I would have ordered just a steak a la carte.

There was only one choice for dessert, strawberry shortcake, and it was very average. It came with three little chocolates on the side, which were also quite average, not flavorful or exciting in any way. My dining partners had the chocolate sin cake, which tasted like a slice of solid frosting: exceptionally sugary, to the point that we couldn't even finish it. 

After dinner, I had coffee, and it arrived lukewarm, which was a somewhat sad finish to the experience."}
{"text":"I have been dining in public establishments for nearly 40 years and never have I eaten such an abysmal meal.  Never. This was the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant.  This includes such gems as Taco Bell,  Waffle House, Roberto's (for the late night burrito eaters) McDonald's...this beats them all. Worst meal ever. I feel like Ruth's Chris should win an award for being in such austere company as fast food/drinking food giants. 

The evening boded well when we (my father and I) got off the elevator and were led to our table. We had a lovely two top in front of a large picture window that overlooked the Quad and Carnival Court.  Normally this view would be terrible due to the predominance of drunken fools littering the landscape but it was nice because it was dark outside.  Our server was friendly, yet slightly pretentious. 

To start, I ordered a Caesar salad and my dad got a lettuce wedge. You know it's a bad Caesar when the very best thing was the shaved cheese on top. It is very hard to mess up shaved cheese. The Caesar salad itself tasted like something you could get at a TGI Fridays restaurant.  Too much dressing, soggy lettuce. As for  the lettuce wedge, Iceberg lettuce is a funny thing.  When it is served cold, it is crisp and refreshing. Unfortunately my father's iceberg lettuce wedge was served lukewarm and limp.  

For our meals I ordered seabass with crabmeat and lobster. My father ordered the roasted chicken.

The sea bass was obviously frozen and heated under a broiler.  The edges had freezer burn and the inside was still cold. The \"crab and lobster\" was the crap that comes out of a can that gets mixed with bread crumbs in order to make stuffed mushrooms.  Mmmmm...stuffed mushrooms.  I like them. With real crab. None of that in sight on my plate.  The whole monstrosity was smothered in lousy Knorr-like Hollandaise sauce.  This inedible mess was $42. $42 for undercooked frozen fish sticks covered in sauce.    Las Vegas is a city where fresh seafood is flown in every single day.  There is no excuse for this dish.

The roasted chicken showed up at the table and the first question my dear old dad asked our server was about the Orange Glob seeping out the middle of the chicken.  Fungal disease?  Unicorn poo? What in the name of all that is holy was wrong with that poor chicken? Nothing!  They had stuffed it with cheese sauce!  Cheese Whiz sauce is more like it.  Everybody knows that cheese and chicken are perfect food partners.  Like bacon and butterscotch, pancakes and ketchup, chocolate and orange juice.  If you haven't tried them you don't know what you're missing. He tried scraping the sauce off to no avail.  He gave up after a couple of bites.  

This delightful experience of gastronomic disappointment and disgust cost a whopping $150 when it was all said and done.  Overpriced.  Miserable food. Nice environment.  I can't stress enough the wretchedness of the food.  

The meal was fleeting, but the indigestion stayed with me all night."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have lived in the valley for decades and just went to dinner here!  The food is amazing and yes expensive. The service is great too. I had a filet mignon and it was the best sizzling steak I have ever had. Ruth Chris is so much better than Remington's.  Our party dressed up but many other guests were in shorts/Hawaiian shirts and that was just fine!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a 2 stars based on my experience. I would give a 1 but my steak was decent.

My date ordered the seared ahi tuna. It was the spiciest and most inedible ahi tuna ever. She was literally tearing after the first bite lol. My date pointed it out to the waiter (who seemed to be having a bad day), he completely disregarded her, said \"this is how it's supposed to be\" and went about his way... Wow, rude, okay... 

When the waiter came back, I asked him to take it away and let him know he wasn't being reasonable. After our meal, the kitchen manager came to see us and asked why we returned the dish. We explained that the appetizer basically took my date's appetite away lol. He apologized blah blah blah.

Service was terrible. The waiter was obviously having a bad day and decided to take it out on us. There are plenty of better steakhouses in the city. I wouldn't recommend this one."}
{"text":"We love Ruth's Cris - usually.  We plan our annual visit to the National Finals Rodeo with the idea of eating at Ruth's Cris one of the nights we are there.  It's a big deal for us.  But not for them.  We had reservations and were truly looking forward to our dining experience. We knew that our bill was going to run well over $400.00, because there would have been three of us, and we were going to splurge.  But we couldn't.  The reason for this is - is that Ruth's Cris called our cell phone and told us it was their \"Slow season\" and if we wanted to change our reservation to an hour earlier, they would book us, otherwise, they were cancelling our reservation.  I told the person that we had come a very long way, had waited a very long time to visit their dining establishment and that the rodeo didn't get over until 9:00pm and we would rush to get there. That's when she told me it was their \"slow season\" and hung up. 
There is a Ruth's Cris Steakhouse in Minneapolis, where our daughter lives, it is wonderful.  We will go there. As it was, we went to Lawry's (which was outstanding) and they were more than happy to feed us.  The next night we dined at The Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  It was amazing, we recommend the Wedge Salad with the best Ranch Dressing ever and the Rib-eye steak.  They were happy to feed us, too."}
{"text":"The service is great, steak cooked perfect and I liked the how the dining room is laid out. Ruth's is now on my weekend Vegas checklist."}
{"text":"We went there on New Year's Eve, and they had this special menu for the special occasion. The atmosphere was quiet and good for dating. The food came in hot and tasty. I ordered a medium rare ribeye and it came in perfectly. As a side dish, I had mushroom, and it tasted rich. For dessert, I ordered their cheese cake and it was very amazing with the blueberry sauce."}
{"text":"Haveing been to Ruths chris in many other areas I was thourougly dissipointed with this location.  We were a late seating i guess (9:15)and rushed to eat with what I would call poor service for a $350 2 person meal. Food was marginal and bread served with meal was stale.

My recommendation to anyone reading this review is to goto craft steak house in the MGM.  If it wasn't for us being in Harrah and it being a little late for dinner we would not have gone - but I figured \"it's Ruth Chris\" so I knew it would be at the very least a good meal.  I was wrong and hope this reveiw helps another to find a better meal while in Las vegas."}
{"text":"Every steakhouse in this price range seems to do something special he well.  For Ruth Chris it is not their service... For the same price the tornado room does the trick every time."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening here.  Spur of the moment choice to come here after having good experiences at other Ruth's Chris.  

It was wonderful, service is always great.  A staff that knows exactly what they are serving and takes pride in the product.  The steaks were excellent as usual, the 400 degree plate may be a bit of a gimmick but the taste speaks for itself so keep them hot!  Just a wonderful evening in every way."}
{"text":"The wait was an hour and 15 minutes for a mediocre streak everyone in party of 5 agreed... our server Jessica was very sweet though. Won't be coming back for the food!"}
{"text":"The Ruth Chris is on the site of the old Range Steakhouse.  While the decor has been modernized slightly and the kitchen has been totally remodeled, it is apparent that some things still haven't changed.

The waitstaff is still ~75% from the Range.  And it shows.  They are SO SLOW.  It took almost 45 mins for the waiter to come and take our orders.  By the time our entrees came, I was totally over it.  And, he made so many mistakes.  Some people's orders were forgotten.  And he gave us the wrong desserts.

Overall the food is good, but for what you're spending, the service does not make up for it.  Plus, even though it is a steakhouse, since some vegetarian guests are accompanying their friends, it would be nice if they had more non-meat options available."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely incredible. I took my boyfriend here for his 22nd birthday dinner because it is his favorite. We had the crab stuffed mushrooms to start with they were delicious followed by two filets and Au gratin potatoes for dinner. Like I said, the food was 10/10 and deserves five stars. The reason I gave this place 2 stars is because of what happened when I paid the bill. I gave our waiter cash and asked for change back. My boyfriend and I are both servers and understand how to tip I was planning on giving our waiter 20% as we were both very happy with our food and service up until this point. Our waiter to my surprise came back with our change minus his 20% tip. Yes that is right our waiter felt it was his responsibility to decide what tip he received. As a fellow server, I understand he was probably profiling us assuming we weren't going to tip well as young adults. However, that action pissed me off so much and makes me question if I will ever dine at this establishment again."}
{"text":"Overpriced, over seasoned, over buttered. I have had better steak at lesser known restaurants. There is too much butter on the steak. The lobster bisque was bitter. The asparagus was also over buttered."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I know of in the valley, where your bill can be close to $200 and not get a five star review. The appetizer, the salad, the bread, the main course, desert, and drinks definitely deserve 5 stars and well worth the money! The whole staff is unpleasant. From the hostess who seems annoyed upon arrival to the waitress who takes your order and the servers who bring your food they all deserve 0 stars. I was a little shocked that on this scale of an restaurant that you would have so many people unhappy and depressing employees. They definitely need a emotional boost in this establishment."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, the best service in Charlotte! all the waiters were very nice and attentive. I ordered the trio steak combo and crab cakes. Two words: the bomb. My mouth is watering just remembering the taste! Highly, highly recommend this place and valet was very quick too!"}
{"text":"This has been a great dining experience. I've been to Ruth's Chris many times but this was the first time I've had the seafood gumbo (soup of the day) and it was fantastic. So tasty that images of New Orleans came over me with every bite. Conversely the lobster Mac & Cheese was not impressive. I didn't hate it, but would definitely not recommend it. The surprise of the night was my appetizer; crab stuffed mushrooms. The portion was more than adequate to share and the flavor was extremely zesty."}
{"text":"Great dinner as ALWAYS! Sat in the bar nice friendly bartenders. YES, the steaks are incredible, however we chose the BURGER!!! I have been dying for burger and this is a definite back up option from their \"Prime\" steaks selection. Started with cocktails , just DEVINE and the Blu Cheese stuffed olives in the Martini's a nice touch. Chose the Spicy Lobster app, DEEEELISH!
   You cannot go wrong dining @ Ruth's"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last Friday for a belated anniversary celebration, we just recently had our second child and it was our first time out of the house and getting to celebrate our anniversary. From the beginning we had a great experience, our server James who was one of the best servers we've ever had allowed us time to get settled in and grabbed us water. When he returned we decided we wanted to buy a bottle of wine, ky wife not being a big wine drinker was not sure what she wanted james walked us through and let us taste several different wines before landing on a great bottle, never once did we feel rushed or likw an inconvience. Once dinner came we ordered, we both had steaks i had the filet with blue cheese and we had a side of brussel sprouts. The whole meal was delicious, during dinner the manager came and introduced himself, he was very polite. Later he came back noticing we did not have a starch and brought us a mashed potato, it was very nice. After our meal, james told us they wanted to treat us to dessert for our ann. They let us pick 2 of any dessert we wanted, and covered it. At the end when we asked for the bill, it was getting late and we had to pick up the kids, james brought us our bill, boxes, and had the valet pull the car up. This was by far one of the best overall restaurant experiences i have ever had the entire staff was great, and they made us feel truly special. It made the lone dinner we will have by ourselves memorable and we really appreciate it."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is outstanding. 

The people, the food, and the location overlooking the strip make this a spot you have to check out. 

You have to go to the front of Harrahs and take an elevator to the 2nd floor. When you get to the 2nd floor, you will see an expansive steakhouse serving up Ruth's famous steaks!  

There is a bar area you can eat (full menu), and they have a large selection of wine and cocktails. 

The food is typical Ruth's: hot, fresh and delicious!  

Reservations are required, but there is usually room at the bar. 

The service is excellent and the staff aim to please. 
The view of the strip is outstanding...a place you need to visit!"}
{"text":"If you decide to dine at this steak house, take their advice and come hungry.  Not only are the steak portions massive, but it's true - they sizzle right in front of you!  My steak was cooked to perfection.  I haven't had a bigger or better steak since.

Sides are ordered à la carte, which also means the meals can be pricey.  The waiter was nice enough to warn us that the sides come in large portions and can easily be shared.  We didn't take his advice and ordered separate sides so that we could try a few of them.  I highly recommend the \"au gratin\", but also recommend sharing.

After failing to finish my meal (only because the portions were too big for me), I politely declined dessert.  The manager(?) kept asking us what we were celebrating that evening.  Apparently nobody goes to Ruth's Chris just because they're hungry.  She got half an answer out of me and shortly thereafter she presented us with a huge slice of cake  The plate was beautifully decorated with fancy writing in chocolate.  That level of service impressed me the most.

The food was excellent, service was excellent, decor was beautiful but kinda stuffy.  Ruth's Chris is very pricey, but worth it if you have a reason to celebrate or have a craving for a good steak."}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale and have always enjoyed a nice dinner out at Ruth Chris, with so many fine dinner steak houses we still always come come back here. We had a great dinner last night, the lobster and steak were both great! Service was wonderful and they were very attentive and help make our experience so nice.  I am very mindful that Scottsdale is causal and laid back when it comes to the dress code, however this is a fine dinning concept and I wish the management would enforce a dress code. While nearly everyone In there last night was dressed nice and appropriately for restaurant, their were a few guys who wore t shirts and dip flops and were dressed more appropriately for the taco stand on beach not a fine dinning restaurant. Ruth Chris has great food and wonderful ambiance and the management should enforce a dress code. Other than that it's a great place and always a great experience."}
{"text":"We celebrated 3 belated birthdays at our favorite steak house Ruth Chris, the steaks...Wow...tender,and the portion sizes of the sides at always large enough to share.
Don't forget to get the Barbecue Shrimp
For an appetizer, this dish yells out
New Orleans Cuisine"}
{"text":"Does anyone know what a 5 star restaurant entail??
From parking attendants dressed unprofessionally to inattentive hostesses to a wobbly table that could have rocked a baby to sleep. Waiter was very professional but for the money spent the food was mediocre and portions were small.  Steak was ordered medium came medium rare. Had to wait for the bill. Awesome to have a choice between black or white napkins. Would not go back. Del Frisco's steaks  was so much better!"}
{"text":"I would have given it 6 stars out of five on the basis of food and service! if it was possible. I know this place is quite expensive but I think its a great reward if you are going there to celebrate a milestone and that is what me any my friend went to do. 

It all start with a call to the store and I asked about the Halal steak option they have... the attendant on the phone transferred me to the manager who was very knowledgeable about halal product. She went on mention that they do not require a 48 hour notice to order halal Steak but merely a 24 hours notice is fine now, due to high demand they have speed up the process. She also informed me that the lamb has also been halal and they have started keeping halal chicken from past 6 months, they can also change the cheese stuffing in the chicken on advance notice. The manager also stated, they are working on putting all this on the site and we will be able make all these reservations and request online.

Me being happy put us down for two steaks... each steak being $65 before taxes. The restaurant has its own parking and is quite nice inside. The over all place was clean and the washrooms were decent to use. 

There came our server Scott...very friendly and nice guys. He already informed us that out halal steaks are here. He was very informative on the menu and friendly to talk to.

Moving on to the menu... as I mentioned we went to celebrate so we went all out. We started of with an appetizer Sizzlin' Blue Crab Cakes, which were two jumbo lump crab cakes with sizzling lemon butter which made the cake soft and melt in your mouth. 

Then came the main course which was a New York Strip Steak... a USDA Prime cut with full bodied texture, quite thick and juicy cooked to perfection with the option you choose from. I like well done, whereas my friend went with medium rare. The sides were fit enough to share as the steak is quite big. For sides we went with Lyonnaise sautéed with onions and Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce on the side. The Lyonnaise were fried Potatoes a little crispy. 

It was quite hard to finish all that and my friend wanted a dessert on top. In the mean time while we were eating the server Scoot came to check on us at different point in time and the manager Heidi also checked in with us to see if everything was good. 

As we decided on dessert, there came Scott with a slice of Creamy cheese cake served with fresh berries and a slice of chocolate sin cake - a combination of chocolate and espresso. These cakes were on the house for our celebration and they were delicious. Trust me I don't like cheese cake but I eat this one like crazy and the Chocolate cake was truly sinful.   

To finish it all up we ordered Cappuccinos which were quite nice and strong. Then came the bill which was quite hefty and big but were prepared for that... So I will recommend this place for celebrations and hitting milestones as the food and service is splendid. 

I will have to run it off tomorrow... lot of food!

For my Muslim brothers and Sisters - they do serve Halal Steak, Lamb and Chicken. The cheese stuffing in the chicken can be changed with advance notice."}
{"text":"Excellent steak and sides in an upscale atmosphere. Pricy, but early bird dinner special is a bargain"}
{"text":"Steaks here are amazing. Flavor is unreal. Sides are decent and service is ok. Only thing that was tough is for locals to get in and out of harrahs is horrible. Luckily enough valet parking wasn't full even though a sign said it was."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that there were many great things about this place. 
Steak was one of the best I've had, and I have tried many.
Now as to the review. 
Got there around 9pm, called early and no reservation req'd. Parked up a bit on Richmond at the meter, so wasn't too bad for downtown. Got inside, was expecting a in hotel entrance as attached but least the dedicated elevator down was nice. Hostess was pleasant (Meg) and also the one I spoke to earlier. Wait staff were good, not any better or worse. The waiter could not recommend beef as he does not eat it, and our glasses needed filling a few times. Otherwise service was decent.
The ordering took a while and there were several groups around and very noisy (Not restaurant's fault - rowdy party of 4 guys after few too many)

Ordered 2 large fillets, sides of scalloped potatoes and sweet potatoes.

Fillet was flawless, great sear on outside and perfect medium, and yes bathed in butter, but not complaining. Plate was sizzling and this thus the steak was warm until the last cut. Sweet potatoes were very sweet (be warned) but I wanted that against the rich and salty of steak and butter. The scalloped potatoes were not bad but would not order again.

2 main complaints beyond all that. First USDA? Really we are in Canada, where is the AAA BEEF? And next was well the price. 2 fillets, 2 sides one glass of wine (Baco Noir) $178.00 Again the Steak was brilliant, but does not justify the cost of paying for sides on top.

Would go again, but only if someone is treating"}
{"text":"Shared a VDay dinner with my other half at Ruth's Chris last night.  I wasn't super excited to go, as there are a ton of other unique joints in Vegas, but I can't pass up a great steak.

This review will be rather short as the bartenders are very generous with their pours here, making the remainder of my evening a little blurry.  My boy ordered a Balvenie Doublewood on the rocks and was basically given a pint for the same price.  With all the generosity, I'm sure we were the loudest and happiest couple in the entire restaurant.  Or maybe the most annoying, whatevs.  Haters gonna hate.

The restaurant is all windows and has a killer strip view.  The bar wasn't overcrowded or too loud and has a nice booth area to hang out in while waiting to be seated.  Starting with the hostess to the server (Tina) - everything service wise was excellent.  The steaks are magically delicious and cooked to perfection.  It's like they douse their steak in butter.. hence magically delicious.  You have to appreciate a steakhouse that knows EXACTLY what medium rare should look like.  

Pricey but worth it for a special occasion due to the food and atmosphere... and, well, the generous bartenders."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointing visit. Service was very good to be sincere, but the food left a lot to be desired in terms of quality. We ordered three filet mignon plates, 11oz. size, and all three of them had huge pieces of fat attached to them. I would say about 20% of the filet was a chunk of fat. That should never be the case with a filet in any decent restaurant. A filet mignon should be so clean that not a single piece remains on the plate, nothing more to say. Go to Mastros and this would never happen. Yes they are more expensive, but you get what you pay for, a 100% edible piece of high quality meat.  The appetizers were good, the dessert was also good, but the steak, they key piece of the meal was disappointing. I will say that when I complained they did recognize that I was correct and took one entire steak off the bill to compensate. Great service and attention, but very poor quality control on the cut of meat out of the kitchen. I would hesitate to go back in fear of the same experience."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner gone wrong. I had a $62 Ribeye steak, rare. It was not a good cut, by the time I had given up trying to eat it there was a pile of bit that I just couldn't eat (I do eat steak fat). That can happen I guess but almost worse was the $12 baked potato.  It was served cold so cold the butter wouldn't melt.  So cold the sour cream didn't warm up. 
I tried the filet my wife ordered and it was not great either. She ordered creamed spinach, I'm not a fan so I didn't have any. She said it was OK.  
We are Diamond Card holders with Harrah's since 2002 and this is the first time we have had such a poor outing."}
{"text":"Update:  December 23, 2016:  Had a wonderful dinner of Ahi-tuna, BBQ shrimp and sea bass. The new discovery----- apple crumble cheese cake with Haagen Das ice cream.  Really good!  


Lovely setting as usual.  We were given a booth that could have accommodated more people so they were very nice.  Here's the rundown.
Delicious crusty bread with butter.  We had seconds (it was so good). 
Spicy Bloody Mary with plenty of horseradish-- good drink with enough alcohol.  Sometimes drinks don't have enough alcohol at certain establishments, but this one was great.  

We had the mozzarella and kumato tomato appetizer with basil and balsamic drizzle.  I looked forward to kumato tomatoes because they are truly delicious.  This appetizer did not live up to our expectations.  The mozzarella was not that good (cut up in cubes)  and the kumato tomatoes were nothing special.  We were very disappointed and would not order this again.  

The sea bass we ordered was perfection.  A thick, flaky piece of fish sitting on minute pieces of sweet potato and pineapple.  When we saw sweet potato on the menu with the sea bass, we assumed we would not have to order a side.  But there wasn't enough sweet potato so we should have ordered one side- maybe a veggie.  

The Barbecue Shrimp came with 10 medium sized shrimp.  This dish was described as having garlic mashed potatoes.  This dish was mostly shrimp and sauce and the mashed potatoes was almost nonexistent.  Keep in mind that I have had this dish many times before and it had enough mashed potatoes to mix nicely with the delicious sauce.  Not this one.  I should have said something but didn't.  

For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse combo-- a chocolate lava cake along with a mini-cup of chocolate mousse. The lava cake was very good but the chocolate mousse was NOT.  The mousse was not dark enough--as if the mousse was made with milk chocolate (not dark, bitter chocolate) or that is was cut with whipped cream. The taste was not good.  We like our chocolate mousse dark and rich and this was not it.  

Our service with BEN was attentive and the manager came by twice to make sure everything was good.  I like the service at Ruth Chris as they make you feel special.  

Despite 3 disappointments during this meal, I still think they warrant 4 stars for service and the food that was enjoyed."}
{"text":"Time for an update.  My husband and I always go to Ruth Chris for our birthdays in October, except for two other times, once to take out the in-laws and once this past weekend when my aunt took us out to dinner - who will say no to great steak!

This time was no different than our usual order.  We each always get the ribeye.  For sides, we used to get the broccoli au gratin and the mushrooms.  We did not see the broccoli au gratin on the menu this time, so we went back to an old favorite, the potatoes au gratin along with mushrooms, and just plain broccoli.  The potatoes au gratin are good, but the broccoli was just better.  Maybe next time they can make that for us?  The mushrooms are fabulous, they changed their recipe though, they used to use big mushrooms, now they are small cut up, probably easier for sharing, but they are still great!  

We ended with cheesecake, which was large enough for the three of us to share.  Good cheesecake, but being a cheesecake lover, I have to say not the best that I've had or nothing to make me go wow!  Still liked it enough to keep eating it :)

Food was great this time, but service was awful.  We had Michael wait on us, will try to get someone with personality and someone who cares to have a customer next time.  As much as I deduct places for bad service, I can't do it with Ruth Chris as we have had wonderful service with other people other times.  Can't let one bad egg this time ruin it.  We will be back in October, not to be served by Michael!"}
{"text":"OMG, FYI, it's p.h.a.t. (pretty hot and tempting ) 

Seriously could not decide where we should dine for dinner on Saturday, we wanted to go somewhere we could dress up and dine like Millionaires. Maybe try Bobby Flay's restaurant or Micheal Mina's? 

We went here instead. I never had anything like it, well, maybe when I was in Japan when I had Kobe beef. This is not Kobe beef, but the filet was sensational!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steakhouse never disappoints!! We came tonight for our anniversary and was happy with the service and delicious food. Our server Jonathan was very attentive to our needs. My wife and I had the petite filet mignon, sweet potato casserole and asparagus!!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian. 

My family loves steak and I love my family so that explains how I ended up here.  I have actually been this is steakhouse several times over the years and have enjoyed their grilled portobello mushroom - it was one of the best I had ever had and I was looking forward to eating it again.

Sometime within the past 18 months, they took their beautiful portobello off the menu.  Their new vegetarian \"entrée\" - pick any 3 side dishes.  Are you kidding me??!! That is NOT an entrée!  As a vegetarian, I am used to eating only side dishes at certain places (like steak houses) but to have that listed as an THE vegetarian entrée is slightly insulting.  This is a fancy pants restaurant and I would expect them to at least keep some pasta in their kitchen! 

The waiter lacked genuine warmth.  When I asked him to talk me about their Malbecs (they had 3 or 4), he only described 1 - their \"feature\" wine.  When I further inquired, he only talked more about their feature."}
{"text":"Who could ever think anyone has a better steak?  Ruth's Chris has never disappointed me!!! It's all about the butter and prime!!!  Dennis spoiled me for our 6th anniversary!!  Of course, the steak is my highlight, but Lavazza Coffee and Chocolate Cake are about to arrive.  Thank you for a fabulous evening!  It was well worth the dress up!"}
{"text":"Make sure that you get there for Happy Hour, runs until 6:30! Great deals on food and beverage! The Chefs deal for dinner was fabulous, romaine wedge salad. Filet & shrimp, and a side of garlic broccoli! Service was fabulous and ended with bananas foster cheesecake! Fun night!"}
{"text":"Closed at 9:30, really???  Terrible service.  That's unheard of in Vegas I won't try to go again if that's the case."}
{"text":"If I could I would give it 3.5. This restaurant is located inside the Harrah's Resort & Casino, and up an elevator.

We made our reservations the same day for eight and we did not have any problems getting a table. We showed up at our reserved time and was seated a few minutes later. The restaurant is really nice, dimly lit and looks out over the strip. 

I ordered (as did most of my party) the three course special. I want to say it was $69 for what I got, which was lobster bisque as a starter, the 8oz filet as the entree with sweet potato casserole as the side, and the chocolate sin cake as dessert. You have a choice for appetizer, entree, and side, but not dessert.

We got some complimentary bread with butter at first. With the appetizer, those of us of drinking age shared a bottle of delicious white wine. The lobster bisque was very good, and pretty filling. Next the steak and the side came out (note about the sides: they are big enough to share with another person, and are not included with the entree - with the three course special a choice of side is included), along with a bottle of red wine that we had ordered, at the waiter's recommendation. The plates are very, very hot. Of course, one of the kids with us immediately grabbed both sides of her plate to move it over, and burnt herself. She was fine, but upset and one of the waiters came over with ice and joked around with her a little. Nice touch! The steak was very good, and I am not a big meat person. The sweet potato casserole was way too sweet as a side, and I would recommend the mashed potatoes instead which my brother got. Too big of a side for one too. The kids with us are huge eaters, and one actually finished their steak which I couldn't do! The waiter was delighted.

It was my opinion, as well as my family's, that having the chocolate sin cake for dessert was too much. The meal itself was very filling, and it would have been much more fitting to serve a sorbet or something else light at the end. As it was, I ended up so full I felt sick.

Everything was delicious, but portions could be scaled down for the three course special as it was way too much food. Our main waiter was fantastic, and incredibly polite. We all enjoyed our meal and the experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends bachelor party.....yum yum.  Nothing better than sizzling steak that melts in yo mouf and an ice cold beer or a glass of wine.  The service here is awesome.  A perfect dinner before hitting up the casinos for a long night of partying."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant for a long time because I always heard people talking about it, so I was excited when I finally made a reservation to go! The restaurant is actually very nice and not what you might expect to find in Harrah's. You can get to the restaurant by using an elevator on the casino floor. There's a big sign, so you can't miss it. Depending on what side of the restaurant you're on, they have a nice view of the strip.

The filet mignon was pretty good (I added shrimp) but the lobster mac n cheese was probably the worst I've ever had. Service was decent but not great. My biggest complaint was how unprofessional the hostess and another employee were before we even sat down. As we were walking back, we passed the two of them yelling at each other over something work related and the F word was used. I could not believe she was cussing someone out on the floor. Needless to say, that was a horrible first impression."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a weekday. Was pretty busy in there. Employees seem very nice.

Ordered crabcakes for appetizer and some steak for the main dish.. can't remember which steak  exactly. Food was very very good but of course expensive. Well it is sort of an upscale place so can't complain about prices...

Had a chocolate something for desert which made my stomach bit gassy.. Not sure if its the chocolate or just my stomach unable to handle the dairy.

Overall nice fancy place to eat out."}
{"text":"Another boring, bloated, corporate steakhouse!  Would you like creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, or mashed potatoes served family style with your hunk of beef?  UGH!!  The ONLY thing that redeemed the meal is that someone else picked up the check!"}
{"text":"Expensive. I tried it so it is added to our list.  The food, well according to my wife best stake in Canada.  I take the Keg anytime.  So here are some facts. Service was puntual.  We had calamari for appetizer. It was ok. Deep fried with sweet and Sauer sauce! I wish fish house was still open with their sizzling grilled calamari.  You don't need sauce for fresh calamari.  Just lemmon. My salad was good. My wife's spinach Au Gratin was excellent according to her. Her filet had to be sent back because it was medium rare (raw inside with blood) rather than medium well. My medium filet was right sizzling in butter.  A tasty stake doesn't need butter. Still I could not taste the difference in their corn fed American stake. I'll take the Alberta beef anytime.  This was $60 just the filet with no sides.  

None of these mattered on our 22nd aniversary.  The entire place is a basement with no windows filled with smell of fried butter. When we arrived the reception looked up my Persian last name and directed us to a special seat. In the corner of the smaller room in between 2 walls.  This room was served by 2 immigrants apparantly rather than their usual Anglo staff. Our waiter was brief and not very helpful. Our little room had the 2nd class clients.  Mother and daughter,  2 guys with a kid, the only black person in the place and a table of Asian looking folks.  I will be with this crowed anytime happily.  However,  the subtle segregation was a surprise to my wife and I. Growing up with religious discrimination in my birth country I thought I had seen all through the years so I am not sure why I still get surprised by the humanunkind."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it's just as good as the others! They were able to seat a party of 6 when no one else could. Food was amazing, as always. Valet guys were hilarious!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday and Ruth's Chris did not disappoint. We made a reservation through 'Open Table' for 7:15p. 
 Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and wished the birthday girl a very happy birthday and as we were escorted to a very nice table near the window overlooking the patio with nice views of the park across Indian Bend. We felt very welcomed.

I ordered the 22oz T-Bone cooked medium and the birthday girl had the 11oz filet medium as well. Our sides were mushrooms and potatoes Au gratin. All was delicious but I regret not trying the Lobster Mac n Cheese. All steaks were cooked as ordered and the potatoes were amazing! 

Our server was very attentive and he surprised us with a complimentary birthday dessert at the end of our dinner. Great experience! A++"}
{"text":"The last time I came here was approximately 20 years ago and the only thing I remember is that the prices were insanely outrageous. 

I find the location to be very suspect. Although, it is located inside the hotel, the only way to have outside access is through the elevator that runs directly into the restaurant. If you were to enter through the hotel, you would have to go downstairs to the lower level where the meeting rooms are located and turn left and walk to one end of that level in order to find the entrance, which is preceded by a long hallway. 

Interestingly, the hostess station (and I say hostess station because I didn't see any hosts) faces the elevator entrance and not the hotel entrance, which is off to one side before the bar. The hostesses were attentive enough but not too bright, as I described the person that I was looking for to be in a bright red dress and they weren't sure. So, I proceeded to give the name under the reservation. They quickly took me to my table. 

The restaurant is quite dark and doesn't look like it has been renovated since the opening; however, this doesn't seem to be an issue, as everything seems very well appointed. The bar was quite cramped and there were a lot of people waiting inside. Although, it was only 6:30 pm, the restaurant was filled, so, if you are going, perhaps, a reservation would be in order. I'd hate to be cramped inside that little bar. The place is loud, so, if you are on your first date, this place may not be for you.

As we were a large table, we were located on a stage type area with 2 seat tables lined up to infinity. I am not sure whether they had a table that was big enough to seat our entire group, but it didn't seem to be a problem. Even the people located on the wall had enough room to walk behind a seated person. Remember this point.
It took the waiter awhile but eventually, he came by to insure that we had water. Drinks were not offered at this point. When my whole table arrived, many of us were surprised that the water wasn't filled sooner. 
When it came time to order, the waited tried to efficiently start from one side and go to the other; however, that side wasn't ready, so, he skipped to my wife and I, who were seated on the outside middle of the table. We ordered and I accidently placed my drink order and was surprised to find that the waiter was rude about it. He wasn't ready to take drink orders. 
By the time the orders were completed, the waited left to put in our order. It was at this point that we discovered that there was a kid's menu that NO ONE had told us about, including the waiter. So, we had to place a second order into the kitchen. The kid's menu comes with a main course, side, dessert and drink. Once again, the waiter was rude to me when I placed the drink order for the kids, telling me that I needed to wait, as he wasn't ready to take the drink orders. 

The meal came, and there seemed to be confusion over who had what. It was made worse, when the kid's orders came and the waiter didn't know who it went to. I saw no attempt for the waiter to try to get to the side with the wall, they just claimed that they would pass it over, as it was too far. The waiters also need re-training, as they would move their body between you and your meal and ask for forgiveness later, rather than asking before moving. I recognize that the meal is hot; however, this is no excuse for the lack of etiquette at this location.

Needless to say, the meal was delicious.  Although, I said delicious, I didn't say it was right. Almost no one at the table got what they ordered in terms of how the steak was cooked, unless you had ordered it well done or medium rare. We didn't bother to send it back, but needless to say, we were disappointed. We were surprised that the kid's meals, which were about $23 each were SO LARGE! Then again, the price tag was high too. The chicken fingers came with 5 large chicken fingers and burnt fries. The children's filet came medium rare, she wanted it medium with tons of mashed potatoes. Someone ordered julienne fries, which turned out to be similar to hickory sticks. I ordered the steak fries and they were overcooked with one end on each burned. The mushrooms were well cooked. The $12 salad was large with fresh cheese, no side salads at this place.

All in all, our total was over $1000. The starting price for a steak was $60, with the average price about $75. There are other things on the menu that aren't as pricey, such as the chicken, which was about $34. So, So overall, the waiter is rude, the food is undercooked, the prices are high. The restaurant is clean, which includes the restroom. There were 3 restaurant reviewers at our table. 33% would not come here again, 66% were unhappy with aspects of the food and 100% of us were dissatisfied with the service."}
{"text":"The service is always excellent and friendly. Even if there is an issue that arises, all are quick to offer solutions and go above and beyond to try and make up for it. I've tried a few different steaks at different cook times, and it's usually spot-on. The stuffed chicken breast is a deliciously decadent option. Portion sizes are huge, so order accordingly. The lobster Mac 'N cheese is phenomenal. Do what you can to save room for dessert. The bread pudding (ask for sweet cream sauce!) and Apple crumb tart always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Very very delicious. We got the Ruth Chris special pre fixe menu. Caesar salad, petit fillet with shrimp, and creme brule for $55. Very worth it. Service was exquisite. Our meal absolutely made the rest of our night that much more magical."}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience at Ruth Chris's. We heard rave reviews from friends and the Yelp reviews matched, so we decided to give it a try. We opted to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Not your typical patio, the tables and chairs were higher-end quality and very comfortable. With the fireplace and candles on each table, the ambiance was just right. A great date night spot ;)

I'll start off by saying that the service we received was outstanding. Our server Erika was very attentive and on point with everything. As for the food...I don't know...maybe it's just me, but I don't get the whole steak-drowning-in-a-plate of sizzling butter thing. If I were to ever eat there again, I would probably request no butter because...well...a good steak is good all by itself, and I thought it altered the flavor. The sides we chose were ok...but it's kinda hard to screw up vegetables. The corn chowder and Caesar salad starters were tasty, but the desert was a bit lacking. The cheesecake is a sour cream base and served in a graham cracker bowl. The banana cream pie comes in a flaky crust topped with carmelized bananas. The presentation of both deserts looked great, but the consistencies were unexpected, a bit \"soupy\".

Everything was good here, but to be completely honest, I've had better at lower price points. Expect to pay around $100 per person for a meal and 2 drinks here.

{"text":"Celebrated my birthday at Ruth's Chris, had a wonderful time :) My sister and I both ordered the rib eye steak so tender and juicy, I got the Shiraz cabernet wine so good :) I will return again for sure, staff very pleasant, thanks sis for the lovely birthday dinner :) and thank you Ruth's Chris :)  for the yummy steaks :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and left feeling a little disappointed. I've heard so many great things about this place so needless to say, I was excited. 

This place is a little on the expensive side but I wouldn't mind it if the food was up to par. 

I guess my biggest disappointment was the steak, and for it being a steak restaurant, that says a lot. I ordered the ribeye and when my ribeye came out, I notice the cut was very lobsided. It's not a nice full piece of meat. There were lumps here and there like the chef did not know how to cut it. 

Other than that, the menu is a la carte meaning you pay extra if you want any kind of sides. The sides were good portion but nothing taste worthy to mention. 

I rather go to Don Shula's if I'm paying this price because at least their food would not disappoint. 

Service was meh, they leave you waiting most of the time so dinner took almost 2.5 hours..."}
{"text":"Family reunion dinner and it was really yummy! Yes it's overpriced by the company and your in Vegas! The started us off with warm bread and butter. I had the salmon and a mule drink. The drink was nice and refreshing. The salmon was cooked perfectly. My family got the stuffed chicken and steak and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Ruth Chris on Saturday was absoutely amazing.. From the hostess to our waiter (Jeff), everyone made our night of celebrations phenomenal.  The steak was cooked to perfection and it appeared, for the first time, visiting any restaurant in Las Vegas (as a local), the entire staff actually loved their jobs. That's an essential key to any experience.  EVERY PENNY was well spent and we'll do it all over again in the near future."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I find that franchise versus local eateries don't compare.  However, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse serves a delicious steak that is always cooked to perfection. Their mac and cheese side is one of the best comfort foods ...They offer a great selection of drinks and a better variety of wines than most . The desserts are impeccable ... If you have space! 

The staff is always attentive, friendly and polite. It makes the difference between a decent meal and a good meal."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris totally lived up to the hype. This was my first dining experience there--and their Restaurant Week menu was too good to turn down. 

I opted for the gazpacho, 12 oz. rib eye, and bread pudding. YUM. 

Loved the 500 degree plate it's served on. Loved our attentive servers. Overall, great time and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service.  Hands down one of the best steaks I've ever had!  Ruth's Chris is one of my \"go to\" higher end restaurants for entertaining guests that desire an upscale environment."}
{"text":"Dined here on Thanksgiving 2011 but sat on the bar side as they were fully booked.  I had the lamb and it was fabulous, as always.  They marinate it overnight and it really makes it something special.  On their website, they have a picture for each entree and the lamb chops arrive to the table looking just like the picture.  My husband had the rib eye and it was a very healthy portion and was cooked to perfection.  And their mushrooms - please, if you love mushrooms, you won't believe how good they are.  I wish I knew their secret."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, service & views of the strip. Love coming to this location, always a good experience. Get the blue cheese panko crust on your steak, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! I would recommend the tuna over the shrimp but plenty of options for all"}
{"text":"Jeffrey Wise was an awesome waiter.  He allowed us to order and change our order many times. We are rather high maintenance and he was patient and hillarious."}
{"text":"Surprisingly this time was very good.  Started with crab cakes and escargos. I had veal chop and my friend had fillet mignon.  Cooked just perfectly right medium rare. Service is very good.  They will call your name since i made reservation online.  I feel good about it. Absolutely,  I will go again."}
{"text":"We love Ruth's Chris but this one in particular SUCKS!!!! We stopped eating there because their service is awful!... So we now order and pick up, this restaurant is so bad we've gotten money back for their crappy service. We have gotten steaks which are the wrong temp, salad without dressing, burnt bread we've had them forget whole entrees all together. We love the bar chips and we now order them when we're picking up and wait till they get them cuz I think they are allergic to packing bar chips. (They forgot to include them yet charged us 4 times!!!!!) we've gotten the wrong order completely and its taken up to 1hr and a half before when we were told 20 min!! Do not go eat here or pick up food. The manager tho nice is a dingbat who does not know what she's doing! Believe me I've been a manager at a Ruth's Chris before!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night for restaurant week. Filet was great, the added lobster was a bit over done but still tasty. Service was terrific! Way to go Ruth Chris staff"}
{"text":"No bad reviews so far, so it must be me. I also feel sorry for myself that I find this place way too expensive while others say its just right. For a meal that costs a $100 per person I was expecting to be blown away. I was not. On the plus side, staff was great, ambiance was great, location good, the slice of cake we had after was a great ending to the meal.

I had the NY strip and it was good. The thing is its not anything someone can't prepare at home with a decent cut of steak, salt and pepper  for 1/3 the price. However, i will go back one more time and give it a chance. I probably ordered the wrong thing the last time."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION IS NOW - CLOSED! Bummer. Years ago when I lived in Vegas this location was one of the first restaurants I fell in LOVE with! Late hours, live music and fabulous food! Now there is still the Paradise location, but its not nearly are relaxing as the old one. R.I.P Flamingo Ruth's Chris! You will be missed."}
{"text":"The steak is awesome and the sides are too. The only downfall is they're EXTREMELY overpriced. Like I said, great food, amazing customer service experience, and the location of this place is nice. If you are looking to dress up, maybe blow about 100-200$ (for 2 people) on dinner, then this is your place. I guess I'm a person who lives on the cheaper side of life. And I can make a steak at home just has awesome as theirs for literally 75% cheaper. Haha :)  (Great for special occasions and if you're really into a woman, it's the first date, and you want to impress, go here. lol)"}
{"text":"EAT AT THE KEG.


Seriously- one of the worst meals i've had. Not only is this place grossly overpriced, everything from the apps to the steaks are poor in quality. I had the petite filet which i ordered medium rare- it was overcooked and literally doused in butter (an ingredient I find they rely on heavily to make everything on their menu taste remotely palatable.) a small side dish of corn and mash potatoes will set you back another $14 each and will have you wondering why on earth you paid that much for a waiter to open a can of green giant corn and warm it up on a plate for you. 

Service at the mississauga location is slow. We waited about 25 mins for apps and then an additional hour for our meals even though ppl who arrived after us were getting served much faster and picking up the bills long before we received our mains. 

Take your money elsewhere- eat at the keg!! you'll be able to have two, maybe three meals there for the price of one at ruths chris and i promise they'll all be way more satisfying!!"}
{"text":"Ruth's is at the top for steakhouses!  You will pay a premium, but boy is it good! At the atmosphere is phenomenal!  if you like high class steakhouses, you will love this place!
The steak is among the best i have ever had."}
{"text":"Great service, food was awesome and they had a Mother's Day special that made it all a great deal!  I say \"great deal\" but this place is uber-expensive.  $50/person, easy and no alcoholic beverages.  Definitely a nice treat but not a \"I come here all the time\" type place."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is terrific in every way.  Service, steaks and ambiance were outstanding."}
{"text":"My husband and I were introduced to this Ruth Chris location due to a Networking Event for The Grays foundation ( A husband and wife duo who does great things in the community in Charlotte). We are new to Charlotte and had never traveled that far up Fairview pass Whole Foods and the Mall so there were other places we discovered back in that section of South Park as well that we can not wait to experience.
We are NOT NEW to Ruth Chris by far, I'm from Chicago and my husband New York City so we've been there and done that. What made this Ruth Chris special and stand out was the exceptional service, professionalism and attentiveness of the wait staff, the manager and the hostess.
The event we attended also made me LOVE this Ruth Chris even more because there was a high percentage of professional african americans and the staff didn't change the way they should treat customers AT ALL and I've found this to be the case at a lot of South Park restaurants we've eaten in (e.g. Maggiano's). The fact that no one on the staff were rude, or lacked attentiveness and professionalism made me want to give this Ruth Chris more business in the near future.
I had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer as my meal ( I wasn't very hungry because there was FREE food catered by Ruth Chris for the event that I nibbled on earlier) and my husband had the Stuff Chicken. My husband LOVED his stuff chicken and I made mention to Nate (our AMAZING waiter) that my shrimp was cold which I believed stemmed from them waiting to bring my shrimp out while my husband stuff chicken cooked (which takes 30plus minutes). I informed him that I was okay eating the shrimp because I didn't want to wait for another batch and eat to late in the evening. Nate was persistent to get me HOT shrimp, so along with the check he brought out HOT shrimp in a to go container and presented it to me and said \"Your lunch for tomorrow\". This was very nice and I appreciated, I indeed added the shrimp to a salad and ate it the next day for lunch.
I didn't get the manager name, however he was VERY nice and came over to check on us twice. He even joked about me taking pictures and I let him know that I was about to Yelp our meal and he said \"Carry-On and I hope you LOVE IT\".."}
{"text":"This is a typical Ruth only difference I notice is the set up only in comparisons to the one back home in Chicago and a couple I've ran across on the road in Raleigh, Indianapolis, New Orleans, etc.. 
Datenight last month had us here as I was holding on to a giftcard I received for my Birthday in 2015 and we decided to use it last month. Our server this visit was Tracy and she was very informative and attentive. 
We've been to this location on several occasions, from Happy Hours to live music on the patio events to networking events and datenight dinners.
As I mentioned earlier Ruth Chris is Ruth Chris and don't vary much between states except the extreme awesomeness of the original location in NOLA. The service at Ruth Chris is very stella and this location is very keen on service. Our food has never disappointed except that one time when we attended last month and the server offered us some Spinach fro FREE as we didn't want a side with our Sea Bass and we accepted and it taste very horrible and overburnt. The waitress was very apologetic and the chef sent dessert with his compliments of Banana Fosters. 
This is a great place to check out on warm weather days the patio is lively though it's small it's very lively."}
{"text":"Delicious steaks, they're the only resturant to serve them on a sizzling hot plate which is great if you like your steak a little more well-done. I like mine blue rare so I was weary about this hot plate situation but the steak was still rare when served so it worked out!"}
{"text":"Savory filet mignon, luscious sweet potato casserole makes for a fine special meal! We had a special occasion and celebrated with a steak dinner that satisfied all in the party. My filet was buttery and mouth watering with delightful flavor. We shares sides-- entrees are individual but sides to share family style--sweet potato casserole is divine with crumb pecan topping that is like dessert. Then shared asparagus grilled with hollandaise sauce, truly tasty. Robert Mondavi cabernet wine was perfect compliment and service was delightful!"}
{"text":"If you like quiet, romantic dinner, then this is the spot. There were 3 of us and we ordered 3 entrees, 2 sides, and a glass of wine.  Our bill was $200+  pricey? Yes! But it was worth it. The steaks and lamb chop were outstanding, even their stuffed mushrooms were flavorful. I don't recommend adding a side salad, as it's not anything significant, and it's $7-8 bucks."}
{"text":"Although not a fan of ala Carte restaurants for Steak and in my case filet mignon  cooked medium was very much on point. The parking here however is a bit awkward as well as how to get into restaurant, very inconvenient but the food and service is good."}
{"text":"Holy Moly was this good!  The husband and I were excited to try this location out.  It's located just inside of Harrah's.  You have to take the elevator up to the second floor which brings you directly to the entrance of the restaurant.  

The dining area is huge.  If you are seated along the outside by the windows, they either face the strip or the Quad.  Makes for a good people watching place.   The hostess' were so friendly with helping us to our table.  Immediately we were greeted by our waiter Dominick.  Let me tell you that he was phenomenal!  When you address us by Mr. and Mrs. E the entire evening, that gets you extra props in my book!   He was polite and so attentive for our dining experience.  It was greatly appreciated!

On to our dinners~  Yum!  I had the Chilean Seabass topped with Crab and Lobster with Hollandaise.  If I wasn't so full from the delicious lobster bisque, I'd want more!  It was cooked to perfection.  The sea bass was light and perfect.  I wouldn't change one thing about it.  I also had the creamed spinach on the side which complimented the meal delightfully!  My husband had the petit filet with grilled shrimp.  Again, perfect! Of course I had a taste of it..  so tender and delicious! He had the potatoes au gratin on the side.  Yep, they were fabulous!  I don't know how many more adjectives I can use to describe how wonderful our meals were.

Our evening here was so enjoyable and I can't wait to come back.  Thank you Dominick and Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"Somebody say butter & steak?! Hmm....must be Ruth's Chris. Steaks come out on a 1500 degree plate with light, regular or heavy butter beneath the steak. I know how it sounds, but it's quitet good. Go for the light butter like I do and you'll be fine and still get a great experience. Nice bar area and a decent outdoor seating area right on Tryon for people watching. Sides are great with many options. If you're an Opentable.com fan, check out the pre-7pm time for a quick 1,000 points.

This is #4 for me on Top 5 Charlotte Steakhouses"}
{"text":"This really was an amazing meal. We went for our anniversary and the service was excellent. I had the bone in new york strip which is their \"signature\" steak. Andrew had the filet. We got asparagus and lobster mac and cheese. They put some confetti on the table for our anniversary which was a cute touch. I had the lobster bisque to start and it was very good. Good size bowl as well. So why 4 stars and not 5? For this price I expect perfection. The steaks were ordered medium and mine was medium well. No pink in the middle. It was so very tender and flavorful that I didn't mind that much but it was overcooked. The lobster mac and cheese was not hot. It was room temperature barely. And it really wasn't that good. Everything else was amazing and the service was perfect. The grilled asparagus is fantastic and the best I have had."}
{"text":"Went to Ruth's Chris last night for an early dinner.  Did not have any reservations and we were able to get a table within just a few minutes.  It was our anniversary and they dressed up our table and that was a nice touch.  We split the Bone in Filet Mignon and a couple of side dishes, everything was just perfect and delicious.  I can say I have never been disappointed at any Ruth's Chris Steak House over the many times I have visited them for dinners.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a very good stake dinner."}
{"text":"I am not a huge steak person but i did enjoy this place. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and ordered the filet mignon. Very tasty! i just felt the prices were a little too expensive for me but i felt it was worth it. Loved the quietness and customer service."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Classy environment, delicious food, and very friendly employees. I have gone here annually for my birthday, and it has remained my favorite restaurant for many years!"}
{"text":"Oh God!! The Filet! To die for I tell you!! Get it medium done with a side of potatoes gratin and Mac and cheese! A spread for a true carnivore who likes to indulge.
I hear the lobster bisque is really good too but I don't like lobster ( I know right!) So if you're into that give it a try. For dessert the chocolate cake is truly decadent.
The service is what you'd expect it to be, spotless. Very helpful, informative and nice staff in a welcoming ambiance.
Last tip- get the pepper sauce on your filet, trust me it just takes it to another level."}
{"text":"I've been to Ruth Chris on several Occasions in different states. And they are all consistent in taste. One thing I will say is the sweet potato casserole is the BEST I've ever had.. I had the filet with the two lobster tails! My my"}
{"text":"The only reason I'd set foot in Harrahs. 

Had not been here in about a year. Service was spectacular as usual. Tom did a great job explaining what was in each dish before and as I enter into my never-to-be-regretted food coma. He also did a great job making sure the rest of the table had a pulse as they stuffed their faces with their steak, green beans with garlic butter, fresh asparagus and Hollandaise, potatoes au gratin, and sautéed mushrooms. We started with Veal Osso Buca Ravioli, which Tom highly recommended, and calamari which were a little mushy. I had the Chicken Breast Stuffed with Herb Cream Cheddar Cheese which there was nothing but half a bone left of, and for our final act we disappeared an exquisite bread pudding. Ta-dá!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent when we had dinner here a few days ago. I am not a huge meat eater so I had the wedge salad, seared ahi tuna and stuffed mushrooms. I couldn't believe how delicious the salad was, after all it is *just* a salad. The ahi tuna was cooked to perfection and the mushrooms were huge and awesome. My husband had a huge steak with mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad and said everything was delicious. We will definitely return for another visit."}
{"text":"The food at Ruth's Chris is very good (and at about $100 per person without going overboard, it'd better be!)  Making reservations there, however, is like flying United; they'll be ready for you when they're ready for you--so just stand around and wait.  The last two times we've been there (both times we were a party of 4, which on one occasion included someone who walked with a cane) we've had to stand in the cramped, packed entry area for 20 minutes or more in spite of having reservations. That, in spite of including a special request when I made the second reservation (\"please adhere strictly to the time of my reservation.\") By the time the table was ready, I was too annoyed to enjoy the experience, which, at $400 for 4 people, should be delightful rather than annoying. Actually, even at $40 it should be delightful; that's the point of eating out. People don't go out so they can wait around until Ruth's Chris decides to shape up its reservations system. Maybe a Yelp review or two can help them realize that this actually MATTERS to people."}
{"text":"I jus came here for my birthday. A group of us came out and i had the BBQ shrimp and It was amazing. They had this particular sauce on the shrimp which was awesome. But wait.... It came wit roasted potatoes which I asked my waiter to add cheese, sour cream, bacon bites & butter was so good. My friends at the stuff chicken which they also said it was good, fresh & hot."}
{"text":"I have to say that it was a bit too pricey for my liking but the fantastic customer service, sublime sin cake, and decent steak are all the reasons why we'd come back for another meal."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this Ruth Chris. My wife and I were able to sit at the bar before our 8pm reservation. Once we were seated at the bar we decided to just have dinner there. I ordered a 16oz ribeye medium +. The bartender explained the chef would understand and medium + is not a problem. When I received my steak it was more well so the bartender agreed to replace it. When my new steak came it was no longer a ribeye but a Porterhouse. I asked a different bartender what type of steak is on my plate? He said he would look on my oder to see. I asked him not to look at my order but tell me. He literally didn't know. He then guessed it was a ribeye. I advise it look d and taste like a Porterhouse. I'm not sure why they decided to give me a Porterhouse instead of a ribeye but I was very, very disappointed in the service and wrong steak I received. I'm been eating ribeyes from Ruth Chris forever and what I received was a Porterhouse. If I'm spending $89 on a steak it should be the correct one. Beware of this Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"We love Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Everything we have ever ordered has been wonderful and never disappointing. Our waiter Jesse suggested the Tomahawk steak for two and it was A-MAZING!!!! So much flavor!!! We would order it again. We also had the lobster Mac and cheese and the sweet potato casserole. They were both wonderful!! You can't go wrong with this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"One of our forever favorites.    Sizzling, tender and flavor packed steaks.   The service is top notch, relaxed, professional, friendly and helpful.   This location is more casual than others we've been to, as far as the crowd coming in (jeans, polos) But the food always satisfies!!"}
{"text":"My first experience here and ordered the 11oz filet. They say the steaks are cooked at 1800° and served on 500° degree plate. How is it my medium done came out damn near raw inside? I should've known not to get steak when I watched 2 others being sent back before we were seated. Only reason I'll give 3 stars is because the salmon I got instead was much better. Add a touch of their onion ring sauce and it is amazing."}
{"text":"I am copying and pasting my review from the Downtown Toronto location as I feel like this location was the exact same...However I did enjoy the location and how it is close to Square One and the Large size of this establishment. 

This is my favorite Steakhouse by far!  I would have given it a 5 star but I liked the location in Try Michigan just a bit bitter.   The Cheesecake in the US Ruth Chris is bigger and more round.  

The sizzling Steaks coming out is a classic Ruth Chris staple as well as great service, steaks, and delicious sides.  My dining partner was not a fan of having to pay extra for a side dish, it dosnt bother me because I would expect a bit to overpay to come to a place like this.

More elegant then the Keg."}

{"text":"Restaurant Week- great atmosphere, decent selection for the $35-48 3 course. Portion were small but managed to walk away with 2 to go bags including dessert. Arrived early soooo we hit the bar. I had my usual Tequila Sunrise- #1800 and boooy was it strong. Date had a cranberry and vodka that he didn't finish. Definitely will re-visit the bar. Waiter was awesome and bar-tender was great as well. Valet Sam was awesome and our camera man. Greeters were welcoming as well. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"We made a last minute decision to eat at Ruth Chris before we went to see Celine Dion.  We parked at Harrah's and then walked to Ceasars after our delicious dinner.  Everything was great.  Service was great...Beth was our server and she was in a cheery mood, welcomed us, talked with us and then made some great suggestions and was not bummed that we were NOT drinking or ordering wine.  Food was perfect, steaks cooked exactly the way we like them.  All 3 of us have different ways to have our steaks prepared.  To top it off, the executive Chef stopped by our table to see how dinner was....that was very cool and appreciated.  Desert was as good as the steaks.  There is not one thing I'd suggest to have made our meal and experience better.  :-)"}
{"text":"Was given inaccurate information about handicap accessibility and didn't taken the matter serious.   The food and service was great though."}
{"text":"The rib eye steak was the winner dish tonight!    The AZ restaurant specials were a great deal to take advantage of.  I actually ordered from the Ruth Chris classic menu where for $43.95, I had more choices to pick from.  The filet and shrimp were good while the chicken tortellini soup was wonderful.  They must have just added fresh mushrooms to their homemade broth prior to serving, for all the elements were perfectly done, not mushy.  I was also pleasantly surprised by their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake with almond bark.  Ken provided us with great service not, stuffy like I had been forewarned.  Very good experience had here!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that I'm not the kind of person who gets caught up in the yelp hype of a particular restaurant simply because there are some positive reviews posted. In addition, I walked into Ruth Chris Steak House with a bit of trepidation because many of the local Las Vegas yelpers I follow hadn't posted reviews of this dining establishment. Many of the reviews were from visitors or tourists who may not know the ins and outs of Las Vegas steak houses.  Just the same, I had high expectations for this restaurant, in part because I knew I was about to plunk down over $200 for a dinner for two. I'm sad to say, those expectations weren't realized. 

The following is my score card for Ruth Chris Steak House: 

Hostess/Front Counter service 

4 out 5 stars. They greeted us with a smile and smartly took time to make small talk as were escorted to our table.

Ambiance

4 out of 5 stars. For most tables, you have an elevated view of the bright lights of the strip (or at least part of it). The table settings and overall decor were as expected.

Waiter service 

3 out of 5 stars. Our waiter, Dean, was relatively cordial and efficient for what he did. He got down to business and took our order relatively quickly. For some reason, he skipped engaging us with small talk or making any personal connection, and his check-ins with us were few and far between (at a time when the restaurant wasn't busy). Food was brought out by a server, so Dean earned a nice sized tip simply for taking our order and dropping off the check. 

Food

3 out of 5 stars. We both ordered filet mignon, salad and a number of side orders, which are easily large enough to share. At the very least, I was expecting an impressive steak, but Ruth Chris didn't deliver.  My steak was merely average.  

Hot plate situation 

Both the waiter and server made a number of cautionary announcements about their entrees being served piping hot 500 degree plates. So much so, I got a little concerned for my personal safety. Put your hand on the plate without oven mitts and you'll could end up in a burn unit. Yikes. I hate Mexican food served in this fashion, and serving steak this way didn't make it any better. 

Something you might factor into your steak order is if you want your steak cooked medium, and (when served) you take time for a couple of yelp photos, a yelp check-in and chit chat with your company, your steak (sitting on 500 degree plate) might just end up sizzling itself up to medium well. I'm just saying its possible, especially when you consider you can fry an egg on the pavement at about 150 degrees.  

I might give Ruth Chris one more try, but only after I've run through a number of other Las Vegas steakhouses."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Ruth's Chris for Valentines day. Food was great but in comparison to previous steakhouses I have visited I found it to be slightly overpriced. The shrimp voodoo appetizer was amazing and the ribeye was very delicious. Only complaint was the lack of attention to all beverage refills - left waiting 5 mins plus multiple times. 

I will for sure visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent service.. a good value in Vegas for a high end SteakHouse.  No complaints.  $200 for 2 dinners with a couple drinks as expected."}
{"text":"Best experience at a restaurant! Don't know how it isn't 5 stars. Elaine was magnificent and the best server I've had. Most definitely the best tasting steak out here."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom's birthday. Great staff, every dishes were delicious. Got the  40oz Tomahawk, big enough to share for 4 people! A little bit pricing but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"My filet was overcooked and it's annoying when a restaurant serves your appetizers when they haven't asked to take your order and expect you to eat with menus in your way. Vodka martinis were tasty.\""}
{"text":"Haven't felt the need to go back....went about 3-4 times mostly on social gatherings.
1) Overpriced
2) can't cook a steak correctly, rare was medium medium was rare etc.. 
2) limited menu
3) staff lacking human quality
4) it's a franchise, I prefer to support small business."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris delivers on what they promise - a really good steak. If that's what you're in the mood for, that's what you'll get. It's not fancy or overly dressed, just really good quality meat prepared very well. Having said that, for the money you'll pay for a complete meal (a steak alone averages $50, not including any sides), you need to blow me away with everything else you serve along with that wonderful steak. Appies, sides, drinks & desserts are no better than you'd find at any neighbourhood pub; they just cost twice as much. Service was excellent. The staff were very knowledgable; solicitous without being intrusive. Decor is ghastly. You really feel like you're in a basement next to a convention hall."}
{"text":"Terrible service, never asked if the steaks were cooked  properly, never refilled water glasses or asked if anyone wanted another beverage, three pieces of lamb (one person's order) all prepared differently, one medium, one raw, one rare! The server was (fake) friendly, but she
really never actually did anything. The food was served by other staff (they were nice). Would not recommend, could have just been an \"off\" night, however, too many other Steak restaurants to waste another (expensive) \"try-it-again\"!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Set menu is always good food and good value. Toronto is one of favorites but Seattle is a close second. Not as good as harbour in to but better than  Seattle mortons. Always enjoy the steak and appetizers."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service all the way around. The location is one of the best in town. 

I had a steak sandwich today for lunch. I was expecting a sandwich, but I only got bread on the bottom. Although the onion ring on the top was kind of cute. The steak was better than I expected. It was amazing!

I'm from out of town and have been coming here for years, and it is worth it every time."}
{"text":"As always, the steak is fantastic and the ambiance is amazing. Overlooking the strip makes it a nice and enjoyable to people watch. The appetizers were great and the steak (petit filet) was cooked properly. Medium rare is medium rare. 
I did have one gripe, and it's a minor one... I wish their wine selection had more cab options. At an establishment like Ruth Chris, I don't mind spending a few extra $$ for a nice glass of wine. I didn't feel that they had too many options. Otherwise, everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had an interesting dinner tonight. I took my son out for dinner tonight to Ruth's Chris in Las Vegas on the strip. . It is his 21st birthday. It went from bad to worse. I was given a menu with one price then given another menu with different prices. My daughter's steak was incorrectly cooked, I was overcharged for my salad and the calamari was cold. Everything went wrong . The waiter Randy kept making mistakes. The manager Anthony was not much better. To top it off when I went to pick up my car, I mentioned the problem to parking attendant and he said that many people had complained about Ruth's Chris at Harrah's. The quality has gone way down. I plan to complain with the parent company."}
{"text":"***It is nice to get away from The Strip to have a meal, but the food at Ruth's Chris is not that great; the steaks are too buttery/dry and too expensive (though I don't believe they have them in Vegas, I much prefer Morton's and Mastro's to Ruth's Chris)***

I first experienced Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills many years ago and enjoyed it.  Since then I have been back to Ruth's Chris at the Beverly Hills location (once) and this Las Vegas location (twice).

My experiences since that first visit haven't been good.  I have found the steaks to be way too salty and buttery.  In addition, they are a little dry for my taste.  Everything else (from salads, sides, desserts) are mediocre at best.  If you are looking for an expensive chain steakhouse to go to, I think you are better off with Arnie Morton's."}
{"text":"Alright folks....I can say I don't give two stars unless they 'earned' them. 

I will have to say this is the first time I have had the opportunity to experience what I once considered one of the best steak houses in the country. I will have to say I was extremely let down. :( 

I have been a server at some of the top notch places around. Of course you are going to think, \"well, she used to be a server, so she is going to rate a bit more harsh...\" Not so much from this little lady. I always appreciate how great most servers are....not judge them based on tiny mistakes are mistimings. Okay, with that said here goes... 

Food was amazing....(if you are on a diet, head straight for the veggie platter) If this was solely based on food, five stars! Thank you to the chefs and kitchen staff! 

Service.....horrible. I was celebrating my boyfriend's business partner's retirement party. I will have to say that our table was a 14 top, however 4 of the group were 11, 5, 4, and 3 years of age. The tab was also prepaid by the retiree's boss. Large table +prepaid tab+kids+auto gratuity=horrible service. This doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.  I had two glasses of wine and a glass of desert wine. I will have to say without a stopwatch in tow or in use, I will easily say it took her more than 15 minutes to hit the service bar to grab my glass of wine. This server had more than enough assistance and the bar was DEAD. I would totally understand if the service bar was behind or I ordered some really strange drink that required a special ingredient that the bartender had to go and get, but I was ordering 'by the glass' wine that was FEATURED on the menu. My second complaint about the service is that when a customer or 'guest' orders a glass of Pinot Noir, you don't automatically assume they want the most expensive glass on the menu. Prepaid or not, I know what I like and if the wine menu is MIA then when I say Pinot Noir chose a glass middle of the road. If I want $14 a glass Pinor Noir I will call it by name. This was NOT Victoria's fault. This was done by a gentleman that was of first assistance. 

Service cont....Soups and Salads were not ordered properly and put in the wrong positions at the table. Sides were also not placed on the table in front of the person that ordered that item to compliment their entree. My boyfriend's steak was medium as opposed to mid-rare. This is easily fixed by asking for a re-fire but at the time, it was extremely tasty, and at that point in service, why interrupt. 

Service cont...I was basically done with dessert by the time Victoria was able to bring my glass of dessert wine. I ordered a glass of dessert wine that compliments chocolate. Too bad I had to stare at my chocolate until my glass of wine arrived. She pulled the whole, my help was running around here trying to figure out where it belonged. Yeah, I wasn't born yesterday....she forgot to order it. 

Okay, enough with the service. The ambiance was impeccable. We had our own, private dining area. Dinner service started at six and we finished up around 9. We had very young children at the table that were incredibly well behaved. I had just met his daughter and her three small children. They didn't act up what so ever. I appreciate being placed in a private dining area. Major thumbs up to mgmt and everyone involved in making it a special evening. 

The management was actively involved in service as they checked on our table at least three times and offered if they could assist in any way. Had the service not been so mistimed and sloppy I could have easily scored Ruth's Chris at five stars. 

I am more than excited to come back and try again as everyone has bad nights and can be a little off."}
{"text":"Butter steak, need I say more. The service & food is excellent, but it comes with a hefty price tag. We ordered a tbone, filet, corn, au gratin, 1 forgotten appetizer, bottle of wine, alcoholic coffee & creme brûlée. The damage was around $350. Will I do it again? Yes, but only for an occasion or holiday. I made a reservation & still had to wait around half an hour. Skip the au gratin & get something else"}
{"text":"This RC has improved a lot. The food is consistently good and the service is much better than in the past. The manager, Lee I believe, has made a real difference. This is now as good of a RC as I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Super awesome location once you actually find this one, hidden amongst offices and a wizard of oz type path of escalators to get to the amazing meat. 2 out 4 in my group asked for the special which was touted as a local albertan cut rather than the regular beef from us. After waiting about twenty minutes we were forced to change our order as they finally figured out they didn't have it soo, just took a while to finally get our meals here. Once we did tho, the filets were perfect, the chicken was tasty and the ahi steaks had a really yummy sauce"}
{"text":"I always love to come to this restaurant it's my most favorite place to come for if I want a really nice steak. Victoria our server was very polite & the bus boys were very helpful! I can't wait to come back in September!"}
{"text":"Steak was amazing! The bread was also warm when served. Warm bread makes a big difference. The creamed spinach which is one of their specialties, was very tasty.

Our server was also very polite. We went the day before Valentine's Day and showed up 1/2 hour before our reservation but they seated us anyway.

It is expensive and I definitely recommend buying the gift cards from Costco for a small discount. You will most likely be paying more on top of the gift cards."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to try out this place during Summerlicious last year. I'll start with the negative first: had I been ordering off the regular menu, I might have been able to pay my rent.  This place is a pretty penny, so I'd definitely recommend trying the Winterlicious menu.

Having said that, this place might well be worth that price tag.  I ordered the stuffed chicken entree and was so grateful for all that flavour being brought into my life.  They do not skimp on the cream cheese filling and lemon butter sauce that accompanies the chicken.  When I eat, I crave flavour and have no time for the subtle.  This meal delivered and then some. And by then some I mean the big side bowl of the most delicious mashed potatoes I've ever had (I'm Irish, I know potatoes).

The portion was pretty sizeable as well, especially in addition to the two other courses included in the Summerlicious menu.

For the other two courses, my friends and I both tried the caesar salad and chocolate cake.  Again, the portions made the money well worth it, and they were very tasty.  I wouldn't say they were as outstanding as the main entree but definitely delicious.  To their credit, I'm not a massive chocolate fan and I'm very picky about my caesar salads, so I'm sure others would still be thrilled by these two items.

My friends tried their filet and were raving about it.  I stole a small piece as well and the meat was perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender.

The staff and overall ambiance was wonderful too.  Our server was incredibly helpful and friendly, and very prompt with service.

In the end, we each paid $45 for the three courses and each left with leftovers.  I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice service, beautiful restaurant.  The food was ok, for those prices I expected it to be much better.  I probably would not eat here again.  Unless I won the lottery."}
{"text":"I loved the restaurant itself but honestly I was not completely impressed with the food. I like City Hall better for steak but prefer the staff at Ruth's Chris. 

My husband and I both had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes and both were just ok. We were not thrilled with our dinner or our desserts. The service though was so beyond fabulous and enough to make me want to return and try something else on the menu. Customer service is everything to me!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's that good. Sizzling, seared butter on a super-heated plate that soaks magically into an already succulent fillet, turning marvelous into magical."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! They are consistent and the staff and GM are all great! The manager will come visit our table a couple times every time. They have given us complimentary dessert and wine. I normally reach out to the manager and he will get us right in. I don't recommend going without reservations . The competition in Vegas is crazy so it says something about them since I keep coming back! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Saturday night was a night for celebrations and wanted to do something different and a bit classy for my special occasion. I decided to give one of Toronto's top steakhouses a try (seeing as I've never been before).

Located just off of the lobby of the Toronto Hilton (at Richmond and University Ave) you enter into Ruth's world after a very short ride down their special elevator. The moment the doors open you're thrust into a steak house from yester-years. The wood trim, the elegant tapestries, the table set ups, everything was the best of the best and very impressive.

Once seated we opened the menu to explore the treasures that awaited us inside - what a menu! Steaks, lobster, chicken, appetizers, fish, anything you want was here, this would be a night to throw calorie counts and healthy eating out the window, it was time to get decadent.

While looking through the menu we ordered a couple of cocktails. I went for the Mint Julep and my date ordered a strawberry-basil smash of sorts. My mint julep wasn't quite up to par with some of the best I'd had, I felt the mint hadn't been properly muddled to release its flavours, also the ice used was incorrect so the result ended up being a bourbon heavy, watered down cocktail. That said the strawberry-basil drink was fantastic all the way through.

For dinner we decided to share a starter and went with the BBQ Shrimp appetizer. It came with 6-7 shrimp served in a row. The shrimp were perfectly cooked (so they popped when you first bit into them) and coated in a delicious bright tasting sauce.

Then came the best part of the meal - the sizzle. Yes, the ads for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse are true, from the moment you walk in all you can hear is the sizzle. The sizzle of steaks, fish filet and chicken, being served on 500 degree plates sitting in a little butter. Each time a plate comes out, you know someone is about to have a great night because of the sizzle.

My date had the aforementioned salmon filet and the portion was easily more than either of us could have eaten - my date did anyway. But my meal is what I was the most excited about, the gorgeous, marbled, juicy ribeye. Amazing. That's all I can say.

To share we split sides of potato au gratin and asparagus (served with a proper sized bowl of hollandaise sauce on the side). Both of these dishes were incredible, I'm still salivating while thinking about the three cheese sauce blend the potatoes were cooked in.

As we were wrapping up our meal, our server surprised us with a complimentary slice of cake which had \"Happy 1st Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate - so incredible! I believe this was the chocolate sin cake.

Our server was top notch, incredibly knowledgeable and the perfect balance between attentive and giving us our space.

Top shelf from top to bottom - I cannot wait to return. Thank you Ruth's Chris for making our night extra special (and extra delicious).

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"the first time I came here was for our first date four years ago, now we're getting married. Yay!

Anyways, RC in Scottsdale is a great restaurant. It is beautiful and romantic. 
 it's never crowed and is perfect for a date night where you can just sip wine and talk the night away. We had their seafood and other things, but were mostly impressed with the steaks. They were excellent."}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food tasted great, but I found that an hour after every time I ate there I didn't feel well.  I think it's because the cook the steaks in so much hot oil.  While it tastes great at the time, there is just too much oil."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate chain restaurants, but steakhouses seem to be one area where high-end chains excel. I have never been to a Ruth's Chris that disappointed. The steaks were cooked perfectly, the wine selection was excellent, the atmosphere was quiet, and the service was perfect. 

I was at the Madison location for a romantic diner for two on Valentines Day, and the service was excellent. One of our steaks was clearly overcooked, and the waiter took back both steaks so we could eat together. The new steak came out very quickly and was cooked perfectly. The waiter comp'ed us dessert. I don't mind service issues like this one when the service recovery is so efficient and appropriate."}
{"text":"I want to eat here every night. What more can I say. Ribeye, creamed spinach and lobster Mac and cheese. My death row meal. Do it."}
{"text":"I've seen lots of these oddly named places around the U.S and took advantage of an invitation (ahem, somebody else paying the bill) to try out Ruth's (Chris's?)
Very swanky, although not off-putting or \"too cool for you.\" 

If you are someone who puts a high premium on paying a lot of money for great steak, and getting it, then this is your place.  My three stars is just cause $50 for a six ounce filet, without any sides, seems excessive to me. 

The grilled mushrooms on the side were excellent. The broccoli, pretty good. Disappointed that the bread seemed microwave warm.  Ruth needs to upgrade her baking technology.

 Service was very attentive and professional without being super warm and friendly (but then, my friend and I were thick in conversation about mostly dull topics so perhaps our server didn't want to be intrusive0.

Great place to bring your dad or other carnivorous friend on a special occasion."}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking of this place! The BF and I went to Vegas last weekend, and opted for a dinner at Ruth's Chris. We'd been to this location about a year ago, and after the horrific service we received at their Paradise Rd location this past February, we opted to come back here. 

It is located in an unassuming strip mall a good distance from the strip, but if that keeps my wait time down to nothing for a table, hey I don't mind the $11 cab ride out there. The service here is just wonderful! Our waitress was friendly and helped us pick out a bottle of wine. And our food came out just at the right pace. Both of our steaks were cooked just as requested and were mighty tasty!

Sadly though, it appears as though this location is closing down =( They had a sign in their lobby directing patrons to frequent the Paradise Rd location in the future. And I guess that means the end of Ruth's Chris dinners in Vegas for me, since I refuse to return to the other location. http://www.yelp.com/biz/ruths-chris-steak-house-las-vegas-2#hrid:YfjHw0PU2ZRJiE4yItk5EQ"}
{"text":"I am deeply conflicted on rating this place. On the one hand, the food here was awesome... as expected. On the other hand, they really put a damper on my valentine's day dinner! My bf and I were headed to Vegas for the 3 day weekend, and decided we wanted to eat at Ruth's Chris for Valentine's Day. I made the reservations sometime last week for this location on Paradise Rd, since we had eaten at the other location last time we were out there. 

We hopped in a cab and headed over to the restaurant for our 7:15 reservation, only to find a line of at least 20 people out the door (all with reservations as well). Come to find out, they had overbooked their reservations and were running AT LEAST one hour behind on seating people. I, along with many other people there, was pretty pissed off. I mean, what is the point of making reservations, ESPECIALLY on a busy night like Valentine's day, if you still have to wait an hour. I felt especially bad for people who had tickets to shows later in the evening who were trying to decided whether they could wait that long to eat dinner and still make it to the show. And to add insult to injury, the first employee we came in contact with after waiting 15 minutes out in the cold just to get in the door, was oblivious and just asking how long the line was and shocked to hear it was out to the taxi drop off area. They should have sent someone out to inform people of what was going on and apologize. 

So we check in with the hostess, and then head over to the bar, clearly some vodka was in order to check my rage. The bar was packed with other disgruntled would-be diners. About an hour to an hour and a half after arriving, we were finally taken back to a table. And from there on out the experience was as expected, the service and food were really good. It's just a total bummer to get all pissed off before such a nice dinner. 

I will be writing an email to complain about the situation and keep you posted of any response."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Ruth's Chris restaurant.   We seemed to have so many waiters at our table and they all passed the blame.   Missing soup, over cooked steak.  My dessert was part of the meal but never showed up.  The free dessert my husband was offered would have been fine but we waited so long for everything else we didn't have the patience.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"My first experience!!! And it was a great one. Excellent service and the manager even stopped by to ask if we were satisfied . My food from the appetizer to dessert was simply amazing!!! I will definitely be returning. Of course it's quite pricey but hey ya get what ya pay for!!! My husband ordered a sizzling steak and I indulged in a few bites. It was sooooo yummy. I had the stuffed chicken and it was seasoned well and tender. I had the barbecued shrimp and the Cobb salad for an app. Omggggg I couldn't believe how great it was. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!! Do yourself a favor and GO NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! Ruth's Chris is back in Vega$. This location is located upstairs at Harrah's Casino. As with any Ruth's Chris, the ambiance is awesome. As soon as we exited the elevators, we were greeted right away by 2 gorgeous Hostesses. We were seated right away. Our seating location overlooking the Strip. A pretty awesome view. Our server Josh was very attentive. Cant go wrong with the Surf and Turf, filet and lobster tail. Ohhh and the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer is awesome especially if you dip your bread in the sauce. Had a great meal and everyone of their staff was very attentive and friendly. Our server Josh even cut and served the cake we brought. Thanks Josh! I love Ruth Chris's experience especially now they are back in Vega$."}
{"text":"Ruth's is the best steak house in my opinion. My steaks have always been spot-on correct and the service the same. I am a real fan of their \"porterhouse for two\". And for this quality, I don't care about the price.

If you, like me, are a veggie fan, beware their steamed veggies are one tiny step away from raw. So I don't recommend steamed veggies as a side, try something that has to be cooked fully, like mashed potatoes. You can request that your veggies be truly cooked instead of raw and hot. When I had broccoli it was so hard that when my fork finally cut thru the stalk it hit the plate so hard and loud that people nearby looked at my table thinking I had broken a plate or shot someone.

I would make one suggestion to the staff: I come there for a somewhat intimate and top-notch dining experience. So leave me (us) alone. We did not come there to meet you, I came there for a good meal and to talk with the person I arrived with. If there's a problem I will let you know (but it has never happened). I don't want the manager coming to my table to introduce himself, especially when I have a mouth full of steak. If I wanted to be entertained, I'd eat at that oriental place that prepares your food at the table."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here after hearing some rave reviews.  
The place was pretty bare, and yet we were not seated near a window for the beautiful view.  I did not complain because we were walk ins I figured the other tables had reservations.  We ate and left, and still there were many tables available with the beautiful view. 
I felt like just plain old water, but the waiter told me they had tap water and offered bottle.  I wish he had told me it was $8 for a bottle of water! 
My husband ordered a steak. It was delicious and tender.  I ordered the salmon which was a little overcooked.  The sides were all pretty good.
For the price of the meal, I expected everything to be top notch: service and food.  The service was ok.  Most of the food was good, but after spending close to $300 I'd go elsewhere next time because it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The ambience, and the service are the best part of this restaurant. The food here has taken a turn for the worst unfortunately. It used to be one of my favorite locations. My steak seasoning was not as good as it has been in the past. And my sides were mediocre at best. The staff treated us very well for our anniversary dinner. This was the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"My cousin got a gift card from RC for 50.00 and used it on ya last night. I'll be honest, when I looked at the online menu last week, I thought we're not going to get much, I hope they give us a lot of bread so I won't be hungry when I leave. Boy was I wrong. He made a 6:30 reservation for Saturday. They open at 5. We were seated immediately. Our great, very handsome waiter Kenneth immediately came over. He asked if we had ever been. We hadn't. He told us how the steaks are cooked, he gave us some suggestions. Best of all, he \"paid\" for our sweet potatoe casserole since he knew we would love it. That's an understatement. I had the bistro steak with horseradish dressing. My cousin had bistro steak with shrimp. They came with choice of sides. We had salad, creamed spinach and crab rice and the casserole Everything was delicious!  Plus the dessert of apple turnover with ice cream came with it. We were way too full to eat. I took them home. I wish I could say I'll be back soon, but as the old 80's R&B song goes..\"ain't nothing going on but the rent.\"  (Look it up, Gwen Guthrie). I'll be back one day. If I hit a big lotto, everyone is invited!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the oft mentioned Ruth's Chris for lunch this weekend was a great experience, from the easy to find location to the sampling of the brunch/lunch menu on a Sunday afternoon.

Our server, Brandon, was excellent!  He made suggestions, checked with the kitchen on a couple of special requests made by our table and our glasses never even thought about getting empty!  The restaurant is nicely decorated and of course would make a great backdrop for any special occasion...we were celebrating 3 birthdays and an anniversary all at once at our table!

Our table of six ordered Shrimp and Grits, Stuffed Chicken Breast, Jumbo Shrimp Chop Salad, Salmon, a New York Strip, and a Steakburger.  I sampled all but the salmon and burger and they were delish, the steak was almost fork tender and seasoned perfectly!!  I ordered the stuffed chicken breast that came filled to overflowing with a yummy cheesy buttery goodness inside on top of mashed potataoes and aspargus - it was all very good!  We shared the sides of sweet potato casserole, mashed potatoes and asparagus and each was prepared perfectly.

Around us we saw some wonderful brunch dishes being brought out and I would love to return for a visit to sample some of that selection of waffles, omelets and maybe even steak and eggs!

For dessert we shared Creme Brulee, Key Lime Pie, Cheesecake and a Chocolate Sin Cake.  The creme brulee was good, not the best I've ever had, as was the key lime pie, nothing super spectacular and the same could be said for the cheesecake.  Now the Chocoloate Sin Cake? Fellow yelpers - I've found the richest most chocolately thing I've ever put in my mouth! Seriously - it warrants a trip back just for this cake, I promise!  I have a yelper friend in mind that simply MUST check it out!

Sure Ruth's Chris is known for steak, but the variety we had this trip shows that there is more to be found than just beef!  Did I mention the Chocolate Sin Cake? Oh? I did? Trust me....you need to try it!

I would have given the restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 if I could have, the half point being deducted for the other 'okay' desserts and the not overwhelmingly yummy entrees, but the WOW factor of the cake and the very good sample of steak I had made me round up!  Go. Eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Literally the best meal I've ever had. We ordered the filet with creamed corn and scalloped potatoes. The server was tremendous and the food was amazing! Will return!"}
{"text":"Chas was the best waiter one could ask for!!  He was friendly, welcoming and had a great personality.  
My friend and I had the fried calamari as an appetizer; it could have been my entire meal.  It was so fresh and the pepper dipping sauce was superb.  Chas even brought out a garlic butter sauce for us to try, which was delicious as well.
I ordered the petite filet, with my \"stick of butter.\"  Just the perfect cut, cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth. 
We also split the baked potato (which could have been a meal in itself too!) with all the toppings to choose from.
Needless to say, I really enjoyed my meal here...  And, thanks Chas for a good time.  ;)"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is okay, overrated!  Paying premium 4 $$$$ signs for ordinary steaks in the basement is a joke.  

I don't go back. Morton's steak house offers everything much better for about the same price."}
{"text":"The restaurant is so nice and the food is always so good. I had the blackened salmon, loaded potatoes, and the bread pudding. Omg it was so good ."}
{"text":"Once again Restaurant Week gave us a winner here, but you really can't go wrong with such excellent selections,and superior service! 

I went for the lettuce wedge salad, stuffed chicken breast and garlic mashed potatoes.

The lettuce wedge salad is one of my favorites here, it has bacon, bleu cheese crumbles and I chose the balsamic vingerette dressing. All of my favorites in one super yummy dish! Nothing is overwhelming on this dish,  all in ingredients work so well together and I loved every bite!

The stuffed chicken breast was so freaking good!!! It's an oven roasted double chicken breast stuffed with garlic herb cheese and served with lemon butter. Every bite of chicken is oozing with that heavenly garlic herb cheese! It's delicious...cooked to perfection, the chicken is so juicy... I want more now! 

The garlic mashed potatoes were whipped and very good. All the sides are served family style so I suggest if you go with a group everyone should try something different because its more than enough to share!

Even though I was beyond stuffed, for the desert, they served mini cheesecakes with blueberries on top. It was delicious! 

I left happy and full and it didn't damage my wallet too much! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Went her for dinner, didn't disappoint as usual..
I went with the blackened salmon, it was very good, love the spicy mac & cheese 
Wish they would bring back the potatoes with the caramelized onions, and the apples!!"}
{"text":"I'm here for a VMWare presentation lunch.  The staff here just bust their humps to serve.  Ever so polite and friendly. Albeit the private room is a little tight for this audience. The staff have to squeeze thorough tight tables and people. Service-Excellent. Food just awesome. Steak is their pride and joy and rightfully so. Excellent but looking it is pricey. Staff make this establishment excellent. I said that already."}
{"text":"We actually came here twice during our recent stay. Our favorite bartender Jason was still there, and he made us a delicious Blackberry Sidecar. On our second visit, I asked the bartender to make a Mint Julep, and he said it would be much better if his comrade made it for me. I really appreciate that kind of honestly, and he was right. It was delicious! He asked a few questions about my whiskey preferences, which shows how much they care about their craft.

The food here is always on-point. This is one place in Vegas that we look forward to and have always been pleased and impressed with."}
{"text":"I went with high expectations so I am sad to report this. I believe when you order a filet medium well it should not be completely bloody except for the outter layer. I showed it to the waitress and asked what she considered it...she even said \"medium RARE\" and apologized. This is my second time there with similar experiences both times. Very discouraging."}
{"text":"Ruth steak house a name synonymous with popularizing the high end steak house concept with locations all over the world.
Similar to other locations it is what one expects in terms of decor i.e. dark wood, leather and dim lighting. The dining area is huge with a separate bar and main dining area.  I decided to sit at bar. 
The Prix Fix Menu  caught my eye as they were offering i.e. 3 courses for 60$ (this sounded like an amazing deals since one pays around 50$ for a steak at other Ruth with extra for any side) The catch is its only between 4:30 to 6:30.
The choices were Salad (House or Caesar) or Soup (Lobster Bisque) for starters.
Mains were Filet, stuffed chicken or a Market Fresh Seafood.
One choice of side (mushrooms, mashed potatoes or creamed spinach) 
Dessert was cheese cake.
I went for the bisque, steak (what else:) and a side of sauteed mushrooms. 
I ordered a glass of Zin as well after going through the extensive wine list.
Service was immaculate and I was checked on from time to time.
There was fresh warm bread accompanied with butter (colder than expected)
The soup arrived in after a short while. Initial impression was good as it was quite smooth till I realized they had used quite a bit of cream to get the richness (it gets to you when you have had a bit) There were tiny bit of lobster meat as well.
So far an average starter.
I finished my soup and waited for the main. The steak arrived with their signature crackling sound of butter on a hot plate. The Steak looked stunning, almost like a cut out from a magazine. Cooked perfectly medium rare as per my instructions. The side of mushrooms was humongous and can easily serve two. 
Full marks here though I feel some people may not like the idea of butter messing up a good steak but one can always ask for the steak without it.
The main steak was the regular filet they serve and not your budget sized portion.
The finale of cheesecake with a choice of blue berry sauce or fresh berries was nothing special (I found it to be very dense actually.
Now how would I compare it to other high $$$ steak house in the city it gets the main event, Steak right for sure. The starter and dessert could be improved. The ambiance is excellent. 
Bottom line is I expect to spend $$$ here and other steak houses that compete with this place. The Prix Fix is a very very good value and based on this is a 4 star meal if I was paying a regular price I would consider other spots as well."}
{"text":"A colossal disappointment! A solo diner, I choose to sit at the bar, unfortunately with no seats available at the bar I sat at a small table in the bar area to have dinner. I waited 15 mins (actually 14:30) before I was even acknowledged. I then watched the waitstaff take drink orders from 3 different tables, all of which had been seated after me. I was finally acknowledged and then waited another 12 mins before my drink order was taken. I never received any bread, despite the waiters promise that \"Fresh baked bread will be right out\" The meal itself was excellent, steak prepared perfectly, however at this price point the delays in service and lack of attention was very disappointing."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to enjoy Charlotte's Restaurant week and treat ourselves to a special dinner...and I must say we were more than pleased with everything!

We made reservations for 8:30 and we were seated by 8:45. Of course we had cocktails while we waited...Our waiter was Simon and he was amazing very knowledgeable and walked us through different wine selections, and starters...everyone selected something different so we could make sure we got most for our money, lol :) And everything was delicious!!!

So here's what I had...

My meal started off with a wedge salad blue cheese crumbles, bacon and the vinaigrette dressing, the presentation was delicious it was a huge portion for the start of the meal!!! To be honest I expected it to be mostly lettuce, but was pleasantly surprised that there was more than enough blue cheese crumbles and bacon toppings to satisfy my tastebuds!

Next was the entree I selected the Bistro Filet with Crispy Onions--absolutely  delicious the meat was so tender I could practically cut it with my fork, there is nothing worse than an over cooked steak....ugh but this was far from it...and from the other dishes I think they dont know how to cook anything wrong...I think if I had to amend my last meal it would include this....sorry mom! But my mouth is still watering from how delicious it was! 

Dessert was the Trio Cheesecake and even though I was stuffed to the brim I had to taste it, and just like the rest of the meal I was not disappointed....

Overall, this was an excellent meal and excellent restaurant, the food, service and experience make it worth a second, third and fourth trip!"}
{"text":"My eyes sparkled at the sight of a deliciously juicy steak on a sizzling buttery hot plate. My heart beat raced and I felt elated being in a steak house ready to feast. And then a group of 4 girls dubbed \"the hostesses\" got between me and my juicy meaty love and brought me to a screeching halt. 

Wait what? 

I don't know what it is with their high school drama, but one of them checked our reservation and asked another one to take us to our table. The other one frowns and says, \"No I took the last one.\" The others diverted their gaze, like clueless students not wanting to be picked by the professor. Silence fell upon us. Awkward, with a capital A. A few minutes passes as the 4 went on with their drama.  Finally, one of them grew up and took the menus and took us to our table.  I watched them in amusement but one more minute away from my juicy steak and I am ready to kick butt. Professionalism should tell you, don't pull that in front of the customers. But the rest of the experience was as smooth as steak knife through butter.  

And now to the food: 

Spicy Lobster- Succulent pieces of lobster, lightly fried, tossed in a spicy cream
sauce. Delicious! The perfect balance of tender lobster, a nice crisp exterior, and a great sauce with just the right hint of spicy. The cucumber salad that came with it wasn't all too impressive. I would've liked a more crispy bite for the cucumbers and less of that a stale and vinegar taste. 

Ribeye- Came sizzling on a hot plate and drenched in butter. Juicy, melts in your mouth, with a delicious buttery taste. Nice marbling. Cooked perfectly. I had the medium and it was cooked evenly and with just the right hint of pink. This is why I love Ruth's Chris. So good. The only con is that it is also incredibly heavy. I already started feeling full after a few bites. But it's soooo good so I kept going for the sake of my mouth.

Potatoes Au Gratin- sliced potatoes with a three cheese sauce. This one wasn't too memorable and rather mediocre. I don't know what it is with amazing steak houses and mediocre side dishes. I had a similar experience with another steak house of similar caliber. 

Chocolate Explosion- chocolate molten cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Pretty good and a nice way to end a meal.   

My last dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse was in Pasadena, California. This being my first time visit to the one in Las Vegas, I didn't know what to expect. The first impression made by the hostesses wasn't all too promising. Luckily, the rest of the experience made up for it and was exactly the same. Our servers were extremely friendly and constantly checked our table to make sure everything is perfect. Amazing service. 

Would I come here again? Yes please!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I will be returning!!!

From the service to the food, everything was impeccable! Our server Carol was knowledgeable, fun and great at giving suggestions and I promised her we would request her section next time we come in. The GM Chris was amazing! We talked with him forever about wine, which always makes me happy :)

Hubby and I shared the Cowboy Ribeye, the potatoes au gratin and the Brussels sprouts. To finish an amazing dinner we had the white chocolate bread pudding and I will never want a different dessert at this restaurant!!

I can't believe I've never gone here before, but I can't wait to return. Thanks, Ruth's Chris!!"}
{"text":"Great steaks and great view. Make sure to bring your players card as the pricing is better. Had the fillet mignon and it was perfectly cooked and buttered!"}
{"text":"This is always my go to steakhouse with my fiancé. I asked her to marry me at this location a year ago. This trip was less than stellar. It seems their prices are much higher than every other RC I have been to. The Ruth Classic three course meal was priced at About $79+ whereas it is $55 at every other steakhouse. We asked for an upgraded cheesecake and the server was confused and we never got the cheesecake. Steak was cooked medium well, not medium as we had asked. They failed to take a group or offer to take a group pic when 4 people in the group had birthdays , and only 3 birthday cakes were served. For the price we pay for dinner, we do not expect Outback Steakhouse or Sizzler service. We expect high end, flawless service. This was not the case here. Very disappointed overall with the service for our party of 10. $1500 tab, was wasted. Not to mention the $40 cork fee we were charged, it is normally $15 at every other RC."}
{"text":"Got there was real prompt on sitting us down and getting our first drinks but after that service was real terrible waiter left and did not come back I have to ask for another waiter. Actually steak was good. You have to try the tuna appetizer. It was excellent."}
{"text":"So ... Have you tried their Happy Hour here? Off the chart amazing food at fast Chinese food pricing. Can't afford Ruth's Chris? Yes you can! For happy hour. Insane crab sandwiches with zucchini fries. Filet Mignon steak sandwich .... Seared Ahi.... I'm killing myself. All $8 big ones same for wine and some cocktails. Best happy hour ever ! Do it!"}
{"text":"Service from Lorne would be 5* and the hostess was lovely as was the constant water refills from the busser. We were gifted this meal and as much as we wanted to love it we just couldn't. The restaurant is in a basement and we felt as if we took the elevator south to R for retro. Retro as in the ambiance, the managers suits and name tags which look like Hilton's 80s uniforms, and even more so a blast from the past, somewhere between BC and AD to be precise - we were clearly seated in the religious corner with a man preaching so loud we felt as if we were committing a sin for enjoying our bananas foster. The steak was good - the corn fed beef brag was awkward - and beer was plenty. But Lorne was awesome. Lorne, you're awesome."}
{"text":"This place was a nice date for a change.  It was pretty fancy, and the service was very pleasant.  I got the \"classic\" meal that includes a starter, entrée, personal side dish and dessert for $50. ( Which actually is a great value for what you get)

The meal included: 
Butter Lettuce BLT Salad 
6 oz. steak and Shrimp
Creamed Spinach ( Very Rich) 
White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake with Chocolate Almond Bark

And unlimited bread :)

It was a lot of food, that would be enough for 2 people.  Next time I go with my boyfriend, I think we will get this meal again and share it with a side of lobster."}
{"text":"This Ruth's is a solid location. The service is excellent and extremely friendly/professional.I don't come much for dinner but have been for lunch and happy hour on several occasions.  They offer various $15 lunch specials and happy hour bites. I absolutely love the steak sandwich with Bearnaise. The portion size is perfect and filling. The crab cakes are also phenomenal! Great spot to grab a bite and it doesn't have to kill the wallet (though it certainly would be worth it)."}
{"text":"The service and food is high end, you will be paying for the quality.
I ordered the complete meal which includes a Harvest salad, you can choose from about 8 different dishes for your entree and a side of potatoes or vegetable. My entree was the 8 oz. filet mignon and a stuffed chicken breast with a side of mashed potatoes. The sides are very large and can be shared between 2 to 3 people."}
{"text":"So my first visit to this place was back in 2011. I have gone back a couple times over the years in which I recently went a month ago but what I have noticed is that the service has gotten really bad. I went with a friend to get dessert and when I asked for the molten lava cake the waitress said they didn't have any in stock. So I ordered the banana creampie which I didn't like very much. The service wwwterribly slow and the staff wasn't that comforting. Looks like Dominicks Steakhouse will be the place to go next time!"}
{"text":"Three star steak at a four star price. The steaks have shrank like a wool sweater in the dryer on high and the service while polite and courteous, lacks the refinement the staff at Ruth's Chris used to be known for. 

Another one bites the dust!"}
{"text":"I'll start from the beginning as I typically do when reviewing a restaurant. We arrived Ruth Chris' a bit early for our 5 pm reservation- though the restaurant was still just opening for the dinner shift, Tashira, the hostess, welcomed my party and I with a warm hello and sat us at the bar while we waited on our table. Erin and Patrick the bartenders were friendly and equally entertaining while creating good conversation and our beverages. Chris and Ashley, the managers on site greeted us while enjoying cocktails at the bar- both with humble greetings and endearment. It was not long before Jessica, another employee, graciously assisted us to our table. Laura Beth our server first introduced herself before engaging us with the daily specials being served that evening. I first noticed her exceptional professionalism, it was rather busy that night and for anyone with knowledge of the foodservice industry, understanding that keeping your cool while doing 300 covers in a fine dining establishment is no easy feat.  After taking our drink order we informed Laura Beth of our plans to attend a concert that began at 7pm sharp, so a sense of urgency was necessary. Z, the servers assistant came at once with bread service, he was kind.  When Laura Beth returned My guest ordered a salad, Petite Filet with BBQ Crab medium rare and Green Beans, and I the Ribeye with Au Poivre sauce medium rare with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and the Potato au Gratin. 
Besides the salad of cool vine-ripen tomatoes and mozzarella, the food arrived hot. Let me say again, the food arrived hot! Everything the way I requested and the chef intended. Proteins cooked to the liking of my guest and as requested, seasoned beautifully, the crab- masterfully prepared by the kitchen staff. My au poivre sauce comparative of French bistros. Green beans crisp and delightful; the gratin, luscious, sexy, cheesy goodness. The wine- perfect. Laura Beth arrived once more to find our drinks full and mouths full, courteously smiling back at me knowing my guest and I were doing just fine. Evening though we were in quite the hurry the team at Ruth Chris did a marvelous job keeping my guest and I thoroughly happy as we dined. I happily advise anyone in or traveling to the area to keep Ruth Chris in mind when seeking dinner and a quite night out with a loved one, cocktails and conversation with business associates in the incredible bar, or even a quick lunch on the outdoor patio with views of Tyron Street and the inhabitants going on with their busy city lives."}
{"text":"Went for New Years Eve, Managed to get a reservation last minute. The wait was minimal, and we were able to get a seat at the bar. Bar tender was very friendly. After a couple of drinks our table was ready. The whole restaurant has a lovely ambience - low lighting, nice decor, maybe some low music would add to the effect. Service was great! Waiter was professional, friendly & very accommodating. Food was cooked perfectly. One thing to know, the side dishes are sized for 2+ people. The food is definitely simple, and I do not mean that as a negative - its uncomplicated and delicious. We unfortunately did not get to try the wine pairings - we has a bottle of Moet & Chandon waiting for us at our hotel room and didn't want to spoil it with mixing too many drinks. We also were so full after the meal, we didn't get to try the dessert menu! 

Can't wait to come back and try their wine pairings & desert next time!"}
{"text":"Steak that comes broiling with butter on a lava hot plate! Need I say more? It's a rare treat (because of the cost) but a terrific one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yea I know and have gone to my local Ruth's Chris, but thanks to being a participant in the Rock n Roll Marathon...you get 20%off!! Winner!
I opted not to get protein over load, so I passed on the steak and got the bass stuffed with lobster & crab......swear it melted like butter in my mouf...yes I spelled that right!! 

Would've been better had I saved this perk for after my run as opposed to before. Next time!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fabulous. We had a great view of the strip; however, I've had better service and food at Outback for far less money.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Let's start with a wow, lol. Stopped by to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was fantastic. I ordered the cowboy ribeye and it was amongst the best steaks I've ever had in my lifetime. I was shocked that the Ruth Chris in Harrahs was indeed a legit Ruth Chris...it is. Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for dinner on 12/21/10 ... I had the lobster bisque (oh momma, that was goooood), spinach salad, and the rib eye, medium rare. My dining pal had the seafood gumbo (very flavorful), house salad and the filet. In addition, we shared some garlic bread with cheese. Everything was super crazy delicious. I forgot how good their steaks taste when they arrive sizzling in butter!!!  I brought half my steak home, and am tempted to gnaw on it right now ... cold out of the fridge.  That is some damn fine beef!

Service was overall good, although I had to remind our waitress that I had ordered an iced tea.  Beautiful bar area, too!"}
{"text":"The steak is perfectection. It was my birthday and everyone makes you feel so special. I was greeted with Happy Birthday from the hostess and it continued from the entire staff. We had the carpaccio, filet, ribeye, lobster Mac & cheese, augratin potatoes and everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting from the States, stay away. They jack up the prices from what they charge in the US (at least on the west coast) for the EXACT SAME FOOD"}
{"text":"This was my first Ruth Chris experience and it was a poor one to say the least.  First of when I got to the restaurant I was waiting for almost 20 minutes before I was given a table even after making reservations.  The server we had was decent, but barely came around to ask how the food was or how everything was going. 

The food itself was probably the worst part of the meal.  I ordered the New York steak with sweet potatoes and peacan as my side.  The steak itself was over cooked and came medium well when I ordered medium rare.  Not a huge deal for me, but my mashed sweet potatoes and peacans had bits of plastic wrap stuck inside the potatoes.  I decided to complain about it and the server simply took it back to the kitchen and had it removed and brought it back.  No substitute or even another side was brought out!

They did give a slice of cake at the end of the meal, but I was a bit turned off the food at that point.  To be honest I've had better meals at the Keg, Montana's or even a Hungry Man Meal better than what this was.  Needless to say I was disappointed for a meal that was at this particular price point."}
{"text":"First experience at Ruth's Chris. Atmosphere was nice, not too dressy. My wife and I both had the ribeye, medium rare. They were cooked to perfection... The plate is heated to keep the steak hot, an awesome idea. I have to say, it was the Best steak I've ever had! Compliments to the chef! The salad was extremely fresh, as was the dressing. The sides were typical and were nothing special. 

I was asked to remove my cowboy hat by the hostess, assuming I was not up on my Cowboy Etiquette. (DUH) 

We made reservations so we were seated promptly. I suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been to the location in San Diego,
and the one in Las Vegas is equally good, if not better since they have to compete with so many other high end restaurants on the strip.

Our server was friendly and very accommodating.
I asked him what are some recommendations for wine, and he went and got a taster for me to try, and I immediately went with the first recommendation. It wasn't too dry like I asked and was smooth red wine.

Things we got:

Cowboy Ribeye - perfect medium rare, melts in your mouth

Calamari - Not the best i've had, but decent

Veal Osso Buco Ravioli - really light, good subtle flavor

Blue Cheese Crumb - a nice touch to add to steak, warm cheese, crispy crumbs

Mashed Potatoes - Delicious

Sweet Potato Casserole - always my favorite side dish, not too sweet, perfect flavor

Overall, if you want high quality steaks, you gotta come here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary here. We had reservations for 6 pm and they had us seated right on time. 

The staff were fantastic and really attentive. They went out of their way to make our night special. They decorated our table with anniversary confetti, congratulated us on our anniversary at every chance, and gave us both complimentary desserts with happy 10th anniversary written in chocolate on the plates. 

The food was amazing. I don't think I've ever had calamari so good! My steak was cooked to perfection and my husband's lobster was just as fresh as when he gets it off the dock in Maine. 

It is pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Steak did you say? In a sizzling plate of BUTTER?? Now you're talking. One thing I love more than meat is butter. What a perfect combination. You order your steak and then you order how large a pool of butter you want your steak to sit in. Waiters cover you as they bring the steak as it spits butter all over the place. Steaks are good if you enjoy the true taste of steak (and butter) without the interference of sauces and such. Side dishes are nice but not amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here last night for his birthday dinner! While this wasn't our first time at a Ruth's  Chris, it was our first time at this location in Charlotte. Everyone was so warm and welcoming, especially our server Erin B. - SHE'S AMAZING!!!!! (Seriously give that girl a raise) not only did she give us excellent service, she was also so kind to take our picture for us and then gave us a full list of things to do in Charlotte which was SUPER HELPFUL and gave us things to do the following day. Our food was just as amazing as the service! We had the filet & lobster tails with the sweet potato casserole & broccoli - everything was cooked perfectly and had us slipping into serious food coma. This Ruth's Chris is  MUST to go to when in town!"}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris.  This location is the fifth one we've visited.  So we were surprised at the bumpiness of the service when we were there on Saturday.  

Arrived with no reservations and grabbed a table in the bar area to eat.  That usually works well in the other Ruth's Chris, plus it's a good spot to people-watch.

Our waiter was friendly and settled us in with menus.  We ordered sparklling water and a glass of red wine.............and waited.

After about three apologies for the slowness in the wine arriving it came - mid-way through the salads.  Hmmm.

Dinner arrived, and as always, the steaks were a shining spot of happiness.  Perfectly cooked, sizzling plates, tender, yummy.  Blissfull.  Oh yes, the Cesar salad and potatoes were also perfect.

We never saw our waiter again.  Ever.  My wine was way long gone, something that would NEVER have happened at the other locations.  He didn't come back to check if everything was ok, if we wanted to order dessert.  Nada.  We had just been abandoned.

The GM was very kind and apologetic, but by then, we just wanted a check and to head out.  And then it took another 15 minutes to get the check.

So why the four stars?  Because Ruth's Chris is a fabulous place to eat.  The food is exceptional and worth the cost for a special occasion or if you just want a good chunk of perfect cow.  As soon as they work the bumps out from being in a new location, it will be killer.  But seriously, maybe wait a few weeks to let that all happen."}
{"text":"I had my best restaurant experience EVER at Ruth's Chris. My date made reservations for 7:30pm on a Friday night. The second we walked in, we were greeted by smiling hosts who complimented how nice we looked. They then proceeded to ask if we were going to prom lol We expected it and I'll take it as a compliment :)

One of the hostess led us to our seats. She sweetly pulled the chair out for me, placed the wine menus on the table and joked if we were even enough for wine lol Moments later, we were greeted by our waiter. He was very tentative and informative as he introduced the menu and the night's specials. He asked if there were any special occasions for the night that he could help accommodate (birthdays, anniversaries, etc). We replied that it was a simple date night. I wish I could remember his name. He was so sweet!

We ended up ordering the T-Bone and Rib-eye steaks. The rib-eye is much more tender and was cooked to perfection. The waiter waited for us to cut our steaks once it was brought to the table. He wanted to ensure they were cooked correctly. The side dishes were served family style. Overall, the meal was absolutely amazing! Throughout dinner, our waiter consistently checked on us, making sure our experience was enjoyable.

The best part is at the end of our meal, our sweet waiter brought out complimentary dessert (even though we told him that there was no special occasion)! It was a sampler that came with a sorbet, cheesecake and chocolate cake. I have a horrible sweet tooth and this was by all means, my favorite part of the meal! We intended to walk around uptown and grab dessert elsewhere, but the sampler was very filling and delicious!

As stated, this was the best restaurant experience I have EVER had!"}
{"text":"Much better than the Keg. Seriously. This is an amazing place for a date or a casual dinner (if you don't mind spending the money). The quality is beyond amazing and the service is very friendly and quick. The lamb is super juicy and buttery. Everything they do here has butter, just for your information. But it makes it taste better!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Ruth's chris Beverly Hills, Ca. We came to celebrate our anniversary in Las Vegas and decided to try it out here. My oh my was is a great experience (sorry Beverly Hills it was better) I loved that their sides they were good proportion and all tables had a view of the strip. Our waiter Johnny came highly recommended and might I say he treated us very well. Thank you for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on reviewing this place but it was pretty exceptional so I'm going to go ahead and do it anyways. 

Our group all got the petit filets with shrimp which was wonderful, very tender and well seasoned. All of our steaks arrived cooked perfectly even though all four of us ordered a different cook on our steaks. The only little hiccup was that the steaks were given to the wrong people which was a bit awkward since the plates are too hot to touch or switch easily. The shrimp was also tender and has a light breading. We ordered the brussel sprouts which came recommended by the waitress, the corn succotash and shoestrings fries as sides. The sides were fine, if a little disappointing, the sprouts barely warm and not much flavor and the shoestring fries a little overdone. Others in my group did quite enjoy the corn though. Finally the desserts came out and they were the stars of our meals. I was there for both mine and my sister's birthday this weekend since we are just a few days apart and they surprised us with two free desserts, espresso  chocolate cake and toasted marshmallow crème brûlé. They were really exceptional with flavors that had been layered expertly, nothing was one noted. The crème brûlé was the best I've ever had!

TLDR:
Mains: 8.5/10
Sides: 6.5/10
Desserts: 10/10"}
{"text":"Ate here a week ago and while steak consistently good the poor value (overpriced) and the mediocre service make it hard to recommend other than if you don't care about money or great service."}
{"text":"Home to some of the best steak I've ever tasted, along with some delicious fish, there is no mismatch of price and quality in this restaurant. Save for a delay despite a reservation, everything came out on time perfectly prepared. The sides of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were heavenly, though I dare not ask for the nutritional information. My biggest qualm is with their bartender: they did not know how to make a Vesper. This would normally not be surprising, but it was on their drink list! Although the subdued lighting makes their dining room perfect for romance or relaxation, I had to use my telephone to read the menu. So if you're reading this, management, add candles or raise the lights! The day I need to splurge on excellent food and wine, I will be right back here.

I have eaten here once."}
{"text":"I tried this place for breakfast a long time ago in Los Angeles and never forgot how incredible the steak tasted. I just recently tried this location (Vegas) recently for an early dinner. This location does look dated and does not give the food and service any justice. Don't be intimidated by the looks of this place exteriorly, the ambiance inside is decent. 

The server started with their bread and butter, which was average. Soon after, he dropped off a stacked basket of Garlic Bread with cheese. I love garlic and not being biased, it was simply perfect! Next was their Sliced Tomato and Onion salad. They definitely don't mess around with their tomatoes, I mean they were chunky, juicy and delicious (I love tomatoes). The bleu cheese wasn't overpowering like I thought and everything together was well balanced and tasty! I also had the chopped salad. This was ok, it was served with a huge pile of breaded onion ring/strings on top and well poritoned overall. As a starter/appetizer, I tried the Veal Osso Buco Ravioli. It came with 4 pieces swimming in the sauce. The ravioli was good and the sauce made it better. 

The Main Event: I ordered the Ribeye Medium Well (I like the center just slightly pink). It came sizzling in its own buttery sauce and smelled like it fell from the sky. Cutting through it took minimal effort and biting on it was no different. It was cooked exactly to my liking, had just the right amount of chew and the flavor was so succulent, I almost fell off my chair! Let me tell you, their ribeye steak is one of the best I've ever had! 

* The service was Excellent.. Server was patient and delightful. The server assistant was attentive. The chef actually came out to serve the steak along side our server, we actually had an intersting conversation table side. The manager even came by to greet us and made sure everything was going well. 

Steak Lovers, their Ribeye won't disappoint.. Guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious and dropped around $200 including wine, tax and tip. Portions were minuscule, quality of the meat was mediocre and felt like the waiters didn't respect us as we were there for Winterlicious. Would have rather ordered from the regular menu and gotten bigger portions. I've had hundreds of steaks in my life and this one was by far the most expensive and the smallest."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing meal here while in Las Vegas. Took advantage of the prix fixe menu which had great options for $70 total. I started out with a garden salad (had the option of ceaser or lobster bisque), had a 6 oz filet mignon for entrée  (option of chicken & salmon) & a chocolate cake for dessert. The staff was very attentive and nice, The martini was strong, and the food was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Ah, the Steakhouse.....a hard review to write

Came here for a bachelor party last weekend. 9 lads out to celebrate the end of a single man with steak and banter. I must confess I hadn't gone to a Steakhouse here in Toronto, I usually prefer the cheap and cheery ethnic food over $60 steak with sides. I got a rib eye with a bit of mornaise. Was quite nice though a bit heavily salted for my taste. The sides were all quite nice."}
{"text":"Never go to Ruth's Chris drunk.

Somewhat (very) inebriated, a few friends and I took a cab to Ruth's Chris for dinner. The server asked if we'd like some water. Dehydrated and sloppy, we all said yes. The server brought a carafe of water which we slammed in a few seconds. \"Another?\" the server asked, \"yes please!\" we responded in unison. This went on a few times throughout the night. We probably had eight to ten carafes of water. 

We get the bill, and lo and behold. This water was bottled Fiji brand water! I'm okay with paying fifty bucks for a nice piece of meat at a steakhouse, but fifty bucks for water?!! The server should have been upfront and asked \"tap or bottled?\" instead of slamming us with his silent upsale. 

Oh, and like everyone else said, the steak is overrated. If you like butter, then this is your place. The steaks are smothered in butter rendering it on the verge of being inedible."}
{"text":"Came here with a large party for my friends bachelor party. Started with an old fashioned. Pretty good, but a bit too watery for me. 

I split the porterhouse for two with a friend and we all shared sides. We got the lobster Mac, Brussel sprouts, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, asparagus, shoestring fries, and potatoes au gratin. Out of those I'd say my favourite sides were the Brussel sprouts and lobster mac. Brussel sprouts were not too salty and good flavour with the bacon and honey butter. And lobster Mac had a good amount of lobster in it, and was very creamy. 

Now for the steak. We got it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Maybe a bit more on the rare side which is what I love. Filet was tender and smooth and the strip was very flavourful. I think there was a bit too much butter on the serving plate, but that is what they are known for. 

Overall great experience to try."}
{"text":"Our annual New Year's Eve dinner at Ruth's Chris was again, perfect! 
The filet was amazing, the sides were delish (they have a brussel sprout and bacon side which is yummy!) and the service impeccable. 
LOVE this restaurant and LOVE the consistency of GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I've dined in before for dinner but this review is for the bar/happy hour.  

Happy Hour lasted until about 6 p.m. & is available Sunday through Friday.  

I joined my girlfriend here for appetizers & dessert.  The appetizer selection was ideal for happy hour, but if you're expecting to find a great deal on alcoholic beverages - don't expect much.  The back of the menu had hand-crafted cocktails for $14 & the rest of the menu included $9 wine, $4 bottled beer.  I mean this is a steakhouse close to so many other bars - you're bound to find a better deal elsewhere if you're focused on getting a drink and a bite that's less expensive.

The crab beignets were super tasty and came on a bed of onion/cucumber salad.  

For dessert, we chose the bread pudding to share.  The lovely hostess recommended the raspberry chambord as the topping, but I actually preferred the grand marnier.  Overall, service was excellent. 

One other thing, RC supposedly validates parking, which is great! However, when I left the parking garbage the attendant mentioned the machine does not recognize validation & charged $5. What's up with that?!"}
{"text":"Great place! We went for our anniversary and they had the table set out with little hearts and we also got a full dessert for free! (Chocolate sin cake, AMAZING)

Obviously the most amazing steak ever, their process makes it different than any other steakhouse. Somehow 11oz steaks come out entirely tender. Def worth a visit"}
{"text":"Best ever had the I give it 20 stars they treat you with a lot of respect their free valet parking wonderful lamb chops cream spinach in garlic mashed potatoes wonderful drink best waitress ever wonderful time here atmosphere is very good"}
{"text":"This is a pricey restaurant that nickels and dimes the customer. My husband and I ordered the dinner special. The specials come with a choice of starter, entree, side and dessert. My husband ordered the carrot ginger soup and I ordered the gold and red beet salad. Both were good. Our ribeye steaks were also good. I asked them to substitute fries for the garlic mashed potatoes. The server said there would be a $2 charge, even though on the regular menu both are the same price. When we got the bill, we were charged $5 for the change. My husband ordered the edamame with corn side. The edamame and corn were swimming in some kind of cream/butter sauce; it looked unappetizing so I didn't even try it. My husband said it was meh. Because it was our anniversary, we could order a dessert from the standard menu. The chocolate lava/mousse was not too sweet and excellent. 

The drinks. My husband ordered the ginger mule. It lacked any hint of ginger. The waiter apologized and brought him a new mule, that tasted no different. I ordered the cucumber cup.  It doesn't take much alcohol for me to feel it and quickly. I tasted not a hint of alcohol and by the time I had finished 1/2, I didn't have so much as a slight buzz."}
{"text":"We have been to other Ruth's Chris Steak Houses before so when we were last in Las Vegas, we decided to give this location a try. The only bad thing I could say about this place is its location. The restaurant is in Harrah's Hotel and Casino. After parking your car in a ghetto-looking parking structure, you had to walk through one of these dinosaur-like casino. The casino is so old and smelly. I am not snotty person by any means but when you walk by people with orange hair, women covered with tattoos from head-to-toes in a see-through dress, a skin-head with tattoos all over his face, etc., you have to wonder why this restaurant is here. After walking through the entire casino, you take a small elevator up to the 2nd floor to find yourself in the restaurant. Weird!

Having said that, the restaurant is wonderful. The view from our table was of Las Vegas Blvd. The service was decent. Our waiter was a 50-ish YO guy who was a bit impersonal but polite. The food was wonderful as expected. I wish Ruth's Chris would relocate to a better location like Morton's or Lawry's."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Ruth's Chris during restaurant week and it was pretty darn good.  Under normal circumstances I can't justify spending $100+ on a meal for two people but during restaurant week we were able to get amazing food for almost half the cost.

The customer service was excellent!  They provide free valet and the hostess checked our coats as we walked in the door.  We had to wait an extra 20 minutes on our table even with a reservation, but that can probably be attributed to restaurant week.  Our server was outstanding as they usually are for upscale restaurants.

The restaurant week menu is limited but all I wanted was a filet so I was totally satisfied with the options.  The steak was perfectly cooked and each bite melted in my mouth!  So delicious!  We ordered a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were also quite good.  The chocolate sin cake dessert is more like a dark chocolate slice of fudge or flourless cake.  It was very good but not quite what I was expecting.

This is a great place to go to celebrate a special occasion, or if you just don't mind spending a little extra money for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Quite tasty, and especially pleasant given that it was on the corporate tab :D

With that said, though, I have had steak that was equal to or even slightly better than the petite filet I had here, and slightly less expensive.  The blue-cheese crust was tasty, but a bit skimpy in portion.  The mashed potatoes?  Tasty, but not inspired.

The lobster bisque soup, though?  That was absolutely heavenly!  The best I've ever had.  And, perhaps amusingly, the garlic-cheese bread was also quite delicious!

Our waiter was friendly and helpful... present enough be useful, but not to the degree of being pestery.

So my take?  Go here if you have some extra cash to spend or haven't had truly good red meat (or soup!) in a while... but if you're on a budget, you can and should probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Slap yo momma good!!! Omg the food was amazing!!! I ordered the Salmon and he ordered stuffed chicken ... 3 words... TO DIE FOR!!!! 

The salmon literally melted in my mouth!!! Sheesh I can taste it now!!! His chicken .. PERFECT!

We ordered Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus for the side dishes and those... Just as everything else... Were amazing as well!!! I have never been to the one here in Chicago however it is now on my list!!!"}
{"text":"I recently received a $100 gift card to Ruth's Chris from my students, so Hubby and I decided to use it last night. Overall, we had an excellent meal. 

Hubby had the gumbo as a starter. It was very flavorful, but had a little less heat than he would have preferred- maybe with the addition of a couple of dashes of Tabasco, he said, it would have been awesome. I had the Caprese salad with thick slices of beautifully ripe and flavorful beefsteak tomato, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I appreciated that they let the tomato and mozzarella be the star by not drowning it in dressing. I absolutely loved the addition of a big piece of flash fried basil, which is something I have seen done a few times on cooking shows recently. Unexpectedly scrumptious.

Both our steaks were perfectly cooked (but you need to be aware that Ruth's Chris tends to under-cook slightly, so a medium-rare is just barely so, flirting with rare). Hubby had the buffalo rib-eye Chef's special which was farm-raised, our server told us, so the meat was not very gamey. It was firmer than a standard rib-eye, but less fatty, and very flavorful. He got it with a mustard crust, which was overkill. I had the regular rib-eye, and it was wonderful. We shared a sauteed mushroom side. 

Neither of us came close to finishing the huge portions, especially because we were saving some room to share the creme brulee. It came just slightly warmed with a perfect sugar crust and beautiful fresh berry garnish. It is one of the best brulees I have ever had- even better than I can make myself! :) The coffee was mediocre.

Is Ruth's Chris the best steak we have ever had? No- that would be Craftsteak in Vegas, but it's still worth the money. Our biggest complaint was our garrulous server- just this side of arrogant and annoying. He must have spent a half-hour loudly waxing poetic about wine, his grandparents, and Chicago to the people behind us, while we sat neglected. And we were amused to note that some of what he said was inaccurate. Oh well, don't know the answer? Bullshit like you do!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK!
In 2006, we had our wedding reception here (call Tomi Sue- shes great!) and all of our guests (60+ were amazed!!)

We come back here all the time!
- Filet Mignon- cooked medium
- Creamed spinach (to die for!!)
- Sauteed Mushrooms (yum!!!)
- Any of the potatoes are good!
- They have a great mousse-cheesecake that is awesome!

They even have Ruth's Chris brand of wine now, which is a good house wine (if you don't want to splurge).

The service is always great and you will NEVER be disappointed in the food.  My husband and I always want to try new steakhouses, however, we know that we will always get the best at Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'd never been here until past weekend.  Ruth's Chris is a perfect blend of Arizona dressy - it's a fancy-ish place but there are people in shorts, jeans, etc.  I enjoy eating off of white tablecloths without being dressed to the hilt.  

Drinks were fantastic.  We tried the strawberry basil gimlet, the blackberry sidecar, and the blueberry mojito.  That alone makes me want to come back for happy hour.  

We started with crab cakes which may have been the best crab cakes I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked flaky crab with nary a hint of fishiness, resting comfortably in melted butter.  

The steaks arrive on 500  degree plates swimming in butter and that is a beautiful thing.  All of the sides I sampled (mushrooms, potatoes au gratin an asparagus) were tasty although the mushrooms were a tiny bit bland. 

Service was attentive and friendly.  It IS expensive so if you aren't prepared for this, there might be a bit of sticker shock.  We knew in advance that it would be on the spendy side.  

Great experience and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"we went for my Birthday.. i was so starving for a great whole lobster, Mortons and Capitol grill their neighbors have always had good lobsters. So we entered the office building after paying for parking... ordered a drink.. which came 1/2 full, as the waiter explained that they were precise with their measured pour and hoped to get the glass 1/2 full.. we began the ordering, I asked about Lobster, and was told us they sold out becouse they only order a few ( really their mark up is like 400% so only a few?). So I ordered the steak.. it was great.. When asked about which wines by the glass were full bodied.. immediately referred me to the 4 most expensive glasses of wine.. 24.00 a glass... hmmm I dont like to be up sold, especially when the wine they were offering is not special.. and a live lobster, should be available on a saturday night.. after all they are live... they keep! All in all.. it was a good meal.. but we will be going back to Capitol grill, Ruths Chris will have to decide if they are milking their customers.. or creating an experience. We felt a bit scammed.."}
{"text":"We remember when this space at Harrah's was The Range, we had several great meals there, the space is just amazing and overlooks the Strip (really, the first Strip view restaurant). We have been to Ruth's Chris in other cities and we were looking forward to our visit to the new Vegas location. Our server, Gina was very sweet, attentive, but not overly so. We started with the BBQ shrimp and it was very tasty. Hubby chose the rib eye and I had the petite filet, both were excellent, flavorful and tender. For sides, we had the mashed potato and asparagus with hollandaise - delicious. For desert, we shared a flourless chocolate cake, the perfect end to a nice meal.

However, for the money spent, there are better choices for a fabulous steak dinner, we recommend Charlie Palmer and the Steak House at Circus Circus."}
{"text":"I have been a long time patron of the Downtown Ruth's Chris.  Over the years we have had many great meals.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  They have been there for years and know their customers and their tastes.  All in all one of the top restaurants in Toronto.  

Last weekend I took a group of four people out to dinner.  We all ordered steaks of various sizes and temperatures.  When they arrived, none of them were done correctly.  Sometimes it is better when all the meals are off rather than just one.  That way everyone eats in sync and you don't have one person eating alone.  They took all the steaks back and instead of throwing them back in the oven, four new steaks appeared all perfectly done.  Everyone's meal was great  (they did new sides as well).  

We ordered coffee and desert and I asked for the bill.  The manager came by and told us that our entire meal was being taken care of, including drinks and dessert.  It was a gesture which was not necessary but one which I will always remember.  When a restaurant or store goes above and beyond what is necessary for good customer service, I think it instills a loyalty which is hard to duplicate.  Hats off to the Downtown Toronto RC and their very thoughtful staff!"}
{"text":"Hey Everyone!  Ruth's Chris Steak House is soooo delicious!  I love it and am impressed every time.  The steak comes out sizzling hot and is so moist.  It's perfect!  If your craving a really good steak and want to spend a little bit more then your typical restaurant, I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Scam artists publishing Menus that show prices that are far less than actual, for example chopped salad 10.50 on opentable menu but actually 16!  That is 50% more than actual!  Manager refused to honor prices, he should be terminated!  Pure evil!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance, and service. In the Harrah's hotel looking down on the Vegas strip. Our group of 8 was seated quickly and service was terrific. The Caesar salad is one of the best I've ever eaten. The 16 oz rib eye steak was amazing and always my favorite steak from any of the high end steak houses. The roasted chicken was also surprisingly tasty and very moist. 
We enjoyed our favorite sides which are the potatoes augraten, garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potato casserole. Good wine selection and finished off with the chocolate sin cake. Will be back for more next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great location across from South Park mall.  Love their filet mignon and broccoli; only wished their portions were more generous for the price."}
{"text":"Mastro's has me so spoiled that I find Ruth's to be like a deflated balloon. I've never been a huge RC fan, but I think they used to be so much better once upon a time! At this price point, I can think of several much better steak houses!"}
{"text":"Could have been the best steak ive had.....ever. My NY Strip was simply that good. Amazing.

Their Harvest Salad was pretty damn good too.

Broiled Tomato and grilled asparagus sides were solid but pricey for portion.

Moscow Mule was money.

Service was adequate but sub par for price points. Finished my steak before he ever even checked on us. Finished my salad before i got my cocktail.

Hate walking into the strip Hellhole called Harrahs but this is a beautiful location overlooking the strip.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Best Steak in town. It is an expensive splurge, but worth it."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant.  The first time we went there, both of our filet mignons were over-cooked.  We usually let go of the fact and finish our dinner but it was just totally off the mark that we had to send them back to the kitchen.  After few min, the manager of the restaurant with the waiter came to apologized and then the head chef came out himself with our new filet mignons and fresh side dishes.  He took his time to converse with us for at least 20min and thanked us for our understanding that things like this happen sometimes with new chefs in training.

*Filet Mignon = wonderful
*Service = exceptionally great
*Atmosphere = very relaxing and classy."}
{"text":"If I'm going to pay top dollar at a nice steakhouse, Ruth's is where I want to go.

Steaks are perfectly cooked, with a nice seasoning to them. Sides are served a la carte. Upon my visit, I had the petite filet, steakhouse salad, creamed spinach & mashed potatoes. Temperature & presentation was top notch!

The wait staff are friendly & knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is classy & clean. I like dressing up to come here & other patrons feel the same way.

Drinks are crafted perfectly. I go with the sour apple martini & it is delicious!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. Came for our Anniversary. We each ordered a Rib Eye medium rare and it came perfectly done and sizzling on a 500 degree plate slathered in butter. I have to say it was the most tender and flavorful steak either of us had ever had! We ordered the Spanish Potatoes, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Brussels Sprouts. Each one was amazing and so delicious. I cannot believe we have never been before. I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"I went to this steak house awhile ago and had a great experience. Atmosphere was very classy and the people there seemed like top dogs lol. The staff was really friendly and presented themselves in a professional manner. I had their  carpaccio to start with a side caesar which was delicious. I had their butternut squash bisque which was smooth, rich, and creamy. I had the Ribeye and it was made medium rare to perfection. The steak was juicy and flavourful. I had mashed potatoes with creamy spinach with a side of shrimp screwers which was perfect. For dessert I had the cheesecake and créme brûlèe, that was awesome too. My experience was actually quite entertaining because there was a couple seated across from me that were in a quiet heated conversation and I couldn't stop saying, \"Oh, Snap!\".  Overall I had a great experience and tad pricey but totally worth it  :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to come here this evening to celebrate and unwind. This was one of our favorite dinner spots in New Orleans, and one we would frequent 3 to 4 times a month. Needless to say given our stellar experience at their New Orleans location we were expecting great service and excellent food, unfortunately neither of those were met. 

To start, when we walked in both hostesses had their heads down looking at their screens, neither acknowledged our presence. After standing there for a minute the hostess on my right finally looked up, not saying a word just stared at me, at which point I said \"reservation for Ryan\" and all I got was \"last name\". I was then informed it would be a minute, no hello, no thank you, no please wait a moment, just \"it will be a few minutes\". Amazing. 

We were seated in what seemed like the loudest room possible, directly in the center of the dining room, literally the opposite of the quiet table I asked for. Our server came to take our drink order (she was wonderful by the way, the only reason you even get a star, other than the fact I can't leave zero). The drinks were excellent, exactly as we remember (one of their signature cocktails we actually love is the coconut ginger lemon drop martini). 

While waiting for our food, which took an exceptionally long time, one of the waiters for another tables dropped and a tray of food directly on my chair. Thankfully none got on me or the cushion, although it startled the hell out of me and 500 degree plates could have burned quite a bit....

The food finally came, the steak was good, the sides were exceptionally smaller than we remember. We normally order one each and split them, there really wasn't enough to do that. When we would dine in New Orleans we would always have leftovers. 

My fiancé had some leftover steak to take home, which was oddly placed in a bread bag, not the traditional to go bag. Small I know, but just one more oddity to the night that has us never wanting to return. 

All in all extremely disappointing, which is a shame. We had such wonderful experiences with Ruth Chris in New Orleans, it's honesty hard to write this review. I think management really needs to address some staff quality issues here, they are abundant."}
{"text":"If you love butter, then this place is definitely for you! I went on a mission to find the best prime rib/steak place, and Ruth's Chris has failed in my eyes. The place is way to buttery and takes away from the natural flavors of the beef. Your money is better spent at Houston's, Morton's or Lawry's. Take it from me.. someone who has gout because of the steak quest!"}
{"text":"I had the rib eye bone in cooked medium and my fiancé had the fillet. Five hundred degrees plates people. Omg, best steak I have eve had. We had sides of lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach. It was heaven enough for me. One place I will be going back to again for sure."}
{"text":"This was one of the best culinary experiences I've ever had. The food was delicious. The environment was lovely. Our server Ramon was OUTSTANDING. Clearly a professional, Ramon made it his business to make our night truly special. I was so impressed by how attentive and personable he was. We will definitely be coming back and obviously requesting our same server."}
{"text":"I live in LA. I regularly frequent Beverly Hills and Woodland Hills locations. Hands down Vegas location is the best!! Food is excellent. Service impeccable. The manager, Anthony, treated us like VIP!!!! I highly recommend visiting this location when you visit Las Vegas! The best ribeye and filet you have ever tried. A+++++++"}
{"text":"Make a reservation this place gets busy. The price truly effects \"you get what you pay for\". Meat so tender and delicious, and side dishes of your choosing. Fell in love with the Vodka mojito with cucumber refreshing and amazing !"}
{"text":"We went to Ruth Chris for my husbands birthday. Honestly it wasn't his first choice and I think he picked it more to please me. He is a chef and likes more foodie places. I am old school and enjoy a good steak and things I can pronounce. The experience was okay, service was not the best. My salad pretty much got taken away from me cause our server thought our food was coming out but it was a different tables food. This would have been a four star rating until what happened at the end. We ordered the meals that come with a starter, entree and dessert. We never got offered our dessert but he said he was being something out for my husbands birthday. So we weren't going to cause a fuss about it. So once I paid I noticed the check and he had charged me for his birthday dessert. I never asked for a birthday dessert, which was nothing special at all. And was the same one that came with our dinner. So I was paying for three desserts and only got one. Once I said something to the server he tried to give me money out of his wallet and was super weird about it. Like this is something he does often but doesn't get caught. I asked him to just adjust the bill. The manger never came out or even said anything. I just felt like this is a common thing to add a few dollars to their bills. And that sucks."}
{"text":"This is my fav steak house. I love the hot plates and the butter and salt combined with such flavorful, tender beef are incredible!! Sides are good and feed 2. I love the creamed spinach and we usually get a potato of some sort cause I think it's mandatory. They have a price fix menu that seems like a good deal. I get the filet or ribeye. If it's under cooked just send it back or press it down on your plate for a few seconds. Crabtini and Creme brulee were awesome also !!"}
{"text":"December 13, 2013 was the day of our visit.  My wife and a friend were y their birthdays. The steak was as good or better than any place I've eaten a filet.  The Sweet Potato dish was fantastic as were the desserts; bread pudding and the flourless chocolate cake they brought with a candle in it for the birthday people.  The service was friendly and efficient.  I hope to visit the Scottsdale, AZ location asap.  Ironically our waiter was from my home town (Albany, NY) and we actually lived in the same two neighborhoods years ago.  He was the best.  Give him a raise.  Thank you for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Well this wasn't too good of an experience at all. My waiter Jonathan had a big role in that, he was very short and seemed annoyed the whole time not to mention it took us over 30 minutes just to get the check, and pay the bill. The food was okay not my $150 bill worth. Honestly if I were to go out for a nice steak dinner I'd stick with Capital Grill, Morton's, or my all time favorite Strip Steak at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"The steak was excellent, and I can't complain about the prices because you have to expect that, but on 3/26/11 the weather outside was a fantastic 65 degrees. This was a godsend, because we HAD to take breaks from the heat inside Ruths Chris on that night. MISERABLE heat! I shouldn't have to see the staff in black coats sweat their asses off while working. It's NOT pleasant to eat when it's 85-90 degrees with no air flow. We waited outside to cool off before and after our meal because it wasn't bearable inside. When you walked back inside, it felt like opening an oven door. 

Again, good food, bad experience. This was an easy one guys.. you could see the patrons fanning themselves to try to cool off. If you are too damn cheap to turn on the ac, at least open a window! This was just unacceptable. I would have preferred Denny's or Sizzler steaks at YOUR prices. It would have been a better experience. Oh and don't tell me you had no idea! I mentioned it EVERY time we walked in and out to the staff, and the only answer to \"Incredibly hot in here!\" was from a guy in a black coat sweating saying \"You're tellin' me man!\" 

At $400.00 for only 4 entrees with tip, we PAID for 45 minutes of freakin' AC!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  this is Ruth Chris's! Never had a bad experience at any location. Las Vegas had I believe three locations at one time. (Have been a resident of Las Vegas for 30 years) Had visited all three at one time or another. Always had excellent food and service. The fillet mignon is to die for. Also they have an excellent array of desserts if you're dessert person."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Vegas I could have celebrated my birthday at of course I chose my favorite restaurant, Ruth Chris. I had the petite filet and au gratin potatoes like always and my favorite drink the strawberry gimlet. Everything was delicious , the waitress was awesome and they treated me good. The restaurant is located in Harahs Casino and you have to take a elevator to get there."}
{"text":"Ruined our Valentine plans.  We made reservations which we brought with us for 8:30 p.m.  When we arrived a long line and chaotic waiting area greeted us.  After waiting 15 minutes to check in we were greeted by a rude front desk person, who let us know it would be 35 minutes or more past our reservation till seating, but to wait in the lounge which was now standing room only.  After watching several arguments between patrons and the front desk, and being told there was no general manager available, we left.  Thank you Ruth's Chris for ruining our plans."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Ruth Chris me and my husband and my three-year-old son the experience is very nice service is excellent the food is pricey but worth it the only problem I had is we ordered our steak medium and it came out pretty rare but I told the waiter that my steak was undercooked and he fixed it with no questions asked very nice I would recommend for people to go here it is definitely more of a celebration kind of place like birthdays and anniversaries and if you go here make sure and ordered the crème brûlée it was amazing"}
{"text":"The food is out of this world! Definitely the best place to eat in Arizona. My hubby & I ate the bone in filet and our daughter ate the salmon. We asked the server Ben to only add light pepper & salt to the salmon & when it was served, it was covered heavily in pepper. So we sent it back, had them recook another with NO pepper & it came served to us again with heavy pepper. So the manager took it off our bill. That's the only issue we had here or else it would have been rated 5 stars instead of the 4. The desserts we ordered were the cheesecake, banana crusted pie thing, and vanilla ice-cream. They used Hagen Daz ice-cream which is our favorite and it tasted delicious, especially with the banana dessert. I don't appreciate hostesses being on their cell phones while greeting customers like the hostess who's from Dallas that greeted us at the door, but the lovely Maddie (Madeline) was a delight. And I know it wasn't anything related to the restaurant because she was checking a personal text. Larry served us this heated butter with BBQ sauce and garlic, it was to die for!!!! So flavorful with all the flavors exploding in your mouth! Pair it with their sour dough bread or with their jumbo shrimp like I did! The food was THE best part of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I LOVE steak and Ruth's chris WAS my favorite place to eat until......my boyfriend called in early January to make reservations for Valentine's day. I was super excited in the month leading up to Valentine's day so he called to confirm our reservation a few days before. When he called, he was told they didn't have a record of his reservation. Since Ruth's Chris is an upscale restaurant he assumed he wouldn't need to get the girl's name he made the reservation with and when he spoke with the manager he basically told him he was out of luck because he had didn't have the name of the girl he made the reservation with. I have been to Ruth's Chris many times in the past, but after this experience, I will not be going back.
I understand mistakes being made, but you'd think with this type of a restaurant they would have  a more efficient way to track reservations. We ended up having a great Valentine's day and he was able to get a reservation at a much better steak place (cooler atmosphere, better food and he received an email confirmation of our reservation with a reservation number!)"}
{"text":"We are originally from Los Angeles CA and decided to visit Scottsdale, AZ for the day.  On the last day of our amazing trip (when it was 115 degrees), we decided to dine at Ruth's.

Obviously the food is amazing but the highlight of the day was the team of Aubrey Davenport & Kenneth Mott.  They put the words 'class' and 'five star service' in Ruth's Chris.  

Aubrey just moved to AZ from Virginia but we know he is going to be super successful because he is attentive, cordial and super friendly.  Meanwhile Kenneth is on point in assisting us and our two year old.  

All I can say is that these guys are AMAZING!

Oh yeah...the food was the best also."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited last week.  I ordered the $67 special bone in ribeye med rare and I have to say it lacked flavor.   I give that steak 1 star.  My friend ordered the petite filet with shrimp and it was a 5 star steak.  Service was great and ambiance amazing."}
{"text":"Best steaks....had filet mignon and rib eye.  So good...with creamed spinach and banana cream pie with caramel sauce.  Excellent service and lovely view."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place, I forgot I was in harrahs during the meal. i only got out like to places like this for special occasions and this place delivered, maybe the service maybe was a little over board, but hey when in rome... The hostess whose name i didnt get was very pleasant, made nice conversation with me on the way to my beautiful table with an amazing view. The service was spot on, I made sure to get there names because they made me feel like a king Soyun and Josh where the ones servicing my meal, they made a great team. The 500 degree plates is a very cool concept, I guess thats their niche.  The food was a bit pricey but nothing too crazy. It is the strip and its Ruth Chris. The place is new and you can tell by the decor they put some serious money into the place, it really added to the experience."}
{"text":"OK, so here is the thing:
I have been to Ruth's three times, but I never had to pay. (Lucky me!)
My boss invites the company to a nice Christmas dinner every year and for the past three years it has always been Ruth's.
(I might or might not  have had something to do with that... 
--~ organizer ;))

Every year the food has been unbelievable delicious.

I have tried different things and here is my rundown:

Appetizers:
The mushrooms stuffed with crab meat are fantastic.
It's too bad they are so filling... ;)
The seared Ahi tuna might be even more amazing.
The fish melts in your mouth and it comes with a drizzled sauce that has just the right spiciness to make the two a great combo.
The lobster bisque is also enjoyable. 
It was my first time trying this dish and I was quite impressed with the rich taste.

Main:
I am getting the same every year: Filet - medium-rare
Why? Because they are just doing it right.
Every time the steak was perfectly cooked and so tender that my knife was sliding through like butter. 
And the taste: Amazing.
My mouth waters just by thinking about it...

I also had the chance to try the ribeye and I am happy to report that it delivered equally.

(I am not going into the side dishes here as I never have any room for those..)

Dessert:
I got the cheesecake twice and the apple crumble last year.
The cheesecake is good, but to be honest I like the apple crumble better. 
It is served warm and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
So yummy!

Drinks:
I've had some very enjoyable red wine at Ruth's, but unfortunately I forgot what it was.
My favorite drink here is the Chocolate Cherry Martini. 
If you like sweet drinks, you will love this one."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with hubby last night.  It was busy and I found it quite boring decor-wise, like a pub bar with some nice linen on the tables.  Nothing amazing.
The food was O.K but not what you would expect for the very high prices.
My steak should have been medium rare but was rare.  I just decided to eat it anyway.  I would have thought a steak house should have got the cook right on the meat.
The Lynonaise potatoes were overcooked and the creamed spinach was too creamy.
The desert was a bit of a joke, strawberry shortcake with a very doughy base, the cream tasted like the kind you get out of a can, it was disappointing.
To be honest I have had better at The Keg."}
{"text":"Everything was PERFECT, QUICK, and FRESH. ENJOYED better than the one in my hometown Chicago. I recently had a bad experience at the 1 in Puerto RICO. But this 1 put me back on track to live the Chris"}
{"text":"Always make my reservations through Open Table.  Our Open Table reservation notes states we are on Atkins & they listened - no bread at the table!!  We go here because it's consistently very good, service is excellent, and for our anniversary they always treat us special.  Steaks are a give in here - cooked Perfectly and slathered in butter.  Droooool!  They did give us a sugar filled treat however for our celebration so this was our splurge night and it was DIVINE!  We will be back again next year!!"}
{"text":"The filet mignon on was literally melts in your mouth perfect never had   Better also the grilled asparagus was cooked to perfection lovely view great ambience a little pricey but melt in your mouth delicious great for a special night but expect at least $150 bill with no wine"}
{"text":"If you have to eat steak, then this is the place.  No more sizzling, tatstee pieces fo dead animals to be found anywhere.  Hmmmm. Full bar healps."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great atmosphere - perfect for celebrating our anniversary! Craig was our server and was the absolute best!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak I've ever had!! everything here is beyond expectation and the service here is world class!! Drinks are never empty and you feel welcome at every moment through the  evening ! this is my favorite steak house in all of the land!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating that I have dined at many Ruth's Chris steakhouses throughout the country but the one in Cleveland was a huge disappointment. Really not sure how they will survive if they don't get their act together. 
I had a party of 6 for an early Sunday dinner to celebrate birthdays. We dined at 5:00 pm. I called 3 times prior to Sunday to confirm reservations and let staff know the dinner was for birthday celebrations. Arrived 10 minutes prior to reservation time and we were seated. There was some confusion about which table we were to be seated at even though the restaurant was empty at this time. 
Service: ridiculously slow. This meal turned into a 2 hour 35 minute ordeal. My elderly family members were getting exhausted sitting there waiting and wanted to get home. We saw the server, Amanda, maybe 3 times. She always seemed a bit confused.  I had to get up to find someone to fill my glass with water several times. 
Food: my family thought the food was good. I had lobster bisque and caesar salad. The salad was floating in dressing, the soup was cold and the lobster meat mushy. 
Location: Public Sq. The valet and entrance is actually off of Superior, not Roadway. 
Special occasions: even though I called 3 times to alert the staff that this was a birthday celebration, there was nothing special. No cards and confetti like the other RC steakhouses do. I spoke to the manager and he brought over dessert for the table, which was a nice gesture, but when I got the bill, all desserts were on it. To top it off, I had to wait another 15 minutes for Amanda to adjust the bill. 
Tip: if you dine with 6 or more, they automatically add 18% to your bill. The server was very lucky as she certainly did not deserve 18%. She did let me know that \"servers didn't show up for work and someone quit and walked off the job\" which happens but when I am paying $400+ for dinner, that is not my problem. Diners deserve top notch service.
Corporate needs to pay attention to this and pay a visit to the Cleveland location. Such a bad experience can really tarnish your otherwise great reputation. I will steer clear of Ruth's Chris Cleveland in the future."}
{"text":"The service was good. We got our drinks and food quickly! They made my husbands birthday special with the confetti on the table and the cheesecake and candle. What almost brought the happy atmosphere down was the family with the whining 2year old at the next table. 
I can honestly say that it was almost a perfect experience 80%. The tiny disappoint was the steak ! While it was good it wasn't great! I've had much better at Fleming's. The sizzling steak reminded me of Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, we have been dining here for years now. I always start with a Lobster Bisque Soup, have the big rib-eye with au gratin potatoes and finish with a scoop of ice cream with a bit of caramel on top. I have never had a bad experience here, the staff is great and I love the live music."}
{"text":"It must have been an off night. 

Service wasn't fantastic. They were out of several things, to include seafood tower and different drink components.

Steak was fantastic. All other items were subpar for Ruth's. 

We will try again but it was enough to steer me away for a bit."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews based on restaurant week experiences, but the one my wife and I just had at this Ruth's Chris location was enjoyable enough that I had to chime in. To start off, the deal here for restaurant week was unreal. Start off with a soup or salad, get a main entree and side, and finish with a dessert combo for $35. Also this location does not charge a corking fee so bringing your own wine rounds out an amazing steal for the meal and experience!

We started out slow with one of the drink managers come by (I think his name was Dan) who was really charming and got us a decanter for our wine. This is not the first time we had been to this location, and later on in the evening when the waiter came over we jumped to the same realization that he had actually served us before! I was impressed as we had not been here in over a year. Definitely some top notch service and staff at this location!

On to the food. The ranch dressing here is the bomb. Mine came on a pretty stellar wedge salad, however I'm pretty sure it makes anything edible. I ended up ordering the filet mignon (8 oz) medium rare and it came out cooked spot on. I realize they use copious amounts of butter on these steaks, but the flavor and presentation with the very hot plate is tough to beat. I got the mushrooms as a side that were good, but not the star attraction. Then there was a dessert of cheesecake and dark chocolate bark which was a great way to end the meal. 

Our overall dining experience took more than an hour and a half, but did not feel rushed at all. I think the wait staff checked in at the appropriate intervals and the length was partly due to us starting slow with our own bottle of wine. It was exactly what we were looking for - something where we didn't feel rushed and could enjoy the overall experience. With some top notch steakhouse competition in Charlotte, I'm glad to say this is one of the better places you can choose!"}
{"text":"Love the melt in your mouth steak. I didn't really enjoy the side dishes as much though. Everything here is delicious and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! We ordered the porterhouse for 2, best of both worlds,filet and ribeye. It was like eating butter. We were very happy with our meal, The service on the other hand made our dining experience less than pleasurable. Our waiter tried to upsell us the entire evening. We consider ourselves foodies and knew what we wanted to
order. It wasn't our first eating out experience. We were just passing through Charlotte and decided we wanted to have a good steak dinner and relax. We knew Ruth Chris would not disappoint; however the waiter was relentless in his sales pitch. To the point of asking if we valet parked at the end. We knew we were in for a less than fine dining experience when coming from the bar(bartender was awesome, he made great quality drinks and was fun) , dropping 70 dollars on drinks, when we told the waiter we wanted only water to begin with as we were just at the bar. When he came back to check on us to take our food order he said he was glad we were enjoying our tap water. Sorry Charlie, we won't be stopping in that Ruth Chris Charlotte South Park again and if we do we will eat at the bar."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in town. I've been to most of the usual players for decent steak, and nothing compares. The service is always impeccable, the food is always PERFECT, and the atmosphere is exactly what we're looking for when we want to go on a date. I've been here at least 20 times, and I'm impressed by their consistency. We love to come here to celebrate anniversaries and milestones because we know we'll have a great time."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????We are satisfied with their filet steak very much. They have a great offer with soup or salad and dessert. So we ordered the set menu but their steak tasted very good like Hillstone and LB steak. Ruth is one of famous steak houses in US, thus they are actually right option to eat steak in Las Vegas. However I decreased one star out of 5 stars because of price. Of couse their service meant price but in general it should be difficult for families to eat set menu for three or four."}
{"text":"Excellent service with delicious food and a beautiful view! You can't go wrong with a Filet Mignon and cheesy mash potatoes. 

We made a last minute reservation right before attending an event. They made sure to serve us promptly in order to make the show on time. 

The staff was very attentive staying on top of our drinks, bread, and our entrees."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I recieved great service everytime. I give this five stars for a combination of things.  Food is great, the waiters are helpful yet not pushy like other places that come around so often you can't even enjoy your meal.  great place for dinner.  you might want to make a reservation depending on the night though."}
{"text":"came here tonight for our first time. we got seated quickly,  and had great service. we got our delicious cocktails - ruby red grey hound, and the blueberry mojito. our appetizers of ahi tuna was unbelievably delicious!! it was very fresh, and had fantastic flavor. the stuffed mushrooms were soggy, and very bland!! we don't recommend the shrooms- even though they are best sellers.  both got filet mignon .I got the ruth Chris special. ...hubby got a la cart. I chose the blue cheese walnut salad- super!! and the creamed spinach was earthy tasting.  we ordered the lobster mac, and first try it was room temp, with cold bits of lobster.  second try they brought it out piping hot. it was pretty boring though,  even with the green chile in it. the sides were plentiful,  enough for at least 3 people to share.  end of meal came with the turtle cheesecake. it wasn't anything special.  all in all, it was very average! definitely nothing special. wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris hands down is the best steakhouse I have ever been to. The filet mignon is melt in your mouth, the service is very good and same with the ambiance in Las Vegas Nevada and even nicer in South Barrington IL. The private booth in South Barrington is the only way to go if you are taking your significant other.

The best option is the 3 course special with your choice of a salad or soup, one side, entree and dessert. I chose the 11 ounce filet and split it with my friend. The raspberry cosmo and the lemon martini with coconut is excellent! 

Be prepared to spend a lot of money but it is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Ok, there is nothing bad I can say about Ruth's Chris. This particular location, in fact. I love Jeffrey, he is a great waiter and wine steward and the service and ambiance in this location is just a bit better than some of the other Steak Houses in the area. There is a very homey feel about the dining room.. you feel almost warm and enclosed as opposed to larger dining rooms that make you feel exposed. My fave item is the Sweet Potato Casserole as a side. 

They were so sweet, we had a special dinner occassion and they actually special ordered the Cabernet Sauvignon Inniskillin Ice Winethat was too rare to find on a restaurant menu.. THAT kind of service is why you pay these prices.."}
{"text":"This was both my wife and my first visit to Ruth's Chris.  We had 7:15p reservations on a Saturday night for restaurant week.  We rolled in about 7:10p and dropped the car with the complimentary valet.  We checked in with the hostess and were seated within about 5 minutes.

We were greeted by a nice waiter, Tony, by our last name.  He had read the notes from our reservation and did a nice job welcoming us and explaining the menu, service, etc.  

For our meals, my wife ordered:

Steakhouse salad w/ Ranch
Stuffed Double Breast of Chicken
Creamed Corn
Cheesecake/Chocolate Bark Duo

I had...

Wedge Salad w/ Bleu Cheese
Petite Filet (medium rare plus) w/ Blackened Shrimp
Creamed Spinach
Cheesecake/Chocolate Bark Duo

The bread and butter were both delicious.  One thing I was bummed about was they cleared our bread with our salad and I would have loved to keep it for our meal.  The butter on the sizzling plate would have been wonderful on the bread.

Salads were both good....I think the wedge was better than the regular steakhouse...it seemed rather basic.

The entree's really were the stars.  My filet was just wonderful.  I loved it so much.  The flavor, the temp, the butter....it was just perfect!  My wife's chicken was also really delicious.  It was a generous portion and she only finished about half and took the rest home.  I cannot brag on the steak enough.  It was def. a 5 star steak!

The sides were just alright for us.  None of the restaurant week options for sides were really of interest for us so we ended up only eating about 1/3 of each side.  Wish we could have traded them for others.  Even for a minimal upcharge I think it would have been worthwhile.  

For dessert, the cheesecakes were delicious.  A few really fresh sweet berries on top were nice.  The bark was not bark....it was melted on both of our plates (I imagine from the plates being warm out of the dishwasher or something).  It couldn't be picked up so it was more of a sauce.  Taste was still okay but textually a little bit of a flop.

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal.  The food and service were both good.  Not exceptional as some reviews say, but I also give a little more grace in restaurant week when it is slammed.  I did have to dock a star despite my steak being a home run because (1) both my wife and I on separate instances had to request refills on our tea.  That shouldn't happen in a fine dining place. (2) mashed potatoes were dropped at our table which we didn't order.  I thought maybe it was a nice gesture since it was our first time.  A few moments later they were retrieved and delivered to another table 3 of 4 tables down from us.  Food should never be given to another table once it has been delivered to one table...especially something as inexpensive as mashed potatoes (3) the chocolate bark wasn't bark...it was melted (4) we would have liked bread with our entree...at least ask us if you can take our bread and we would have said no. 

In the end, it I had limitless resources, I would eat their steak everyday.  It was the best steak of my life---no joke.  I wanted to give 5 stars, I really did...but enough little things add up."}
{"text":"I have been to several Ruth Chris locations in different states but this was the first time at this location. I ended up going on Valentine's night 2015 with a few friends and thought it was going to be extremely busy with subpar service . I was wrong very wrong.

Our reservations were at 730. Our waiter was very quick to start out drink orders and see if we had any questions about the menu. They were properly staffed so much that we were able to have an in depth conversation with our waiter which was nice.  

You will find the menu to contain the typical steakhouse entrees and sides. The steaks are great and always perfectly cooked how you order them. As far as the seafood the lobster tails were amazing not overcooked. I recommend the lobster mac and cheese, or the sweet potato casserole as sides

Overall I had a great experience here like always."}
{"text":"Happy hour!!!!!! You gotta check it out. Had an amazing meal for less that $25 that's 2 entrees and a drink. Can't really beat the price i paid for the quality of food I received. Have eaten here during regular dinner and it was delicious for the somewhat pricey amount. To eat during happy hour feel like knowing that it's WAY WAY cheaper makes everything taste better 



Prime burger and fries was cooked perfectly (medium rare) fries were probably not freshly made but I enjoyed them regardless. 

Fried lobster on a salad bed. 

All delicious. And worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent fillet  mignon and sides. Steaks are consistently excellent AND service is always solid. Only thing I'd change is the ambiance which always feel kind of heavy / dark."}
{"text":"After checking out this place for many years, but deciding against it based on the price we finally ate here for dinner. 

My wallet is unhappy, but was stomach was really happy. Expect to pay about anywhere from $60 or more per person. I ordered the Rib Eye steak, which is supposed to have more flavour than the New York strip. The rib eye was really good. It had great taste, was cooked perfectly and had a meaty texture. Was it worth the price? I'm still not sure about that. My mom ordered the New York Strip, which I actually preferred as it was more tender, than the rib eye and similar in flavour to the Rib Eye.

If you are getting a regular main; how it works, is you order your steak and then some sides for the table to share. The sides we got were the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach, spinach with garlic, cauliflower and mushrooms. My favourite sides were the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach, and the mushrooms which come in a red wine sauce (if there is one side you should get it's this one). 

The service was excellent. Servers are friendly, the meals came out hot and they even clean the table in between courses. It seems like everyone there was celebrating an anniversary, birthday or special occasion. They added little happy birthdays on our table, which I thought was a nice touch. The restaurant also served us complimentary dessert as we were celebrating 2 birthdays. The dessert was a flourless chocolate cake. This was delicious, rich, and decadent a good way to finish the meal. 

If you are not looking to break the bank the Ruth's Classic is a worthwhile consideration. You get an appetizer, main, side, and dessert for $53. The portion sizes for this is pretty big too.

If you are looking for good steak and want to celebrate a special occasion, I think this is a good choice. However, the price for me is where I'm hesitant about coming back. Maybe if it's a special occasion."}
{"text":"l want to start with how many of these ruth chris cocktail, wine, whisky, vodka dinners we have attended in the pass 6 yrs. at least 2 a yr. If not more. We booked our friday dinner at least 4 months back only to find out a week before it had been cancelled. Could it be they never advertised a Friday dinner? Tonight by far was the worst service we have ever received. Food n drinks were great as always. First round of drinks. One person on our table gets a drink 5 mins later 2nd person. 5 mins later the next 2 people. This goes on for each and every drink and course. 3rd course we never received. We had to request our course. 4th course the server spilled a full glass of water on the person across from me. He said I hope th fob works for the car. They did remove the steak from his tab. For the money it cost to attend thess dinners this will be our last until they get better organized. OMG!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite chain steakhouse. Went here for my boyfriends birthday. We had a room at Harrah's so we just had to take the elevator down to the restaurant. I even got to collect Total Rewards Points on the meal.  I'm shocked we didn't eat here every night. 

Disappointed no one offered my boyfriend dessert since it was his actual birthday and I must have mentioned it the staff at least twice. I'm not going to dock stars for that, because we were too full for dessert."}
{"text":"By far, the best steak in my opinion. The first time I ate there was in Chicago during a business trip. It was delicious. Now every time we are in the Toronto area we make a special trip to Ruth Chris. My favourite item is their calamari, you've got to try it. 
We're going there again this weekend. I can't wait."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Thanks Kristen. Staff address their patrons on first name basis and it's amazing they remember throughout your stay. First time to have a blueberry mojito. It was awesome. Calamari was different as I'm used to the California  style,  but this one has a twist,  they have some kind of sweet sauce in it. Make sure I will stop by again when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not bad, but for basically the same price, you can do a lot better. 

One of Ruth's signatures is that their steaks come out on a plate of sizzling butter. If that sounds a little rich and decadent, it's not...it's VERY rich and decadent. That being said if you're going to eat at Ruth's Chris, you might as well go with it. It will make you feel like crap for days, but it tastes really good.

Again, for the same money you can dine at Morton's, Donnavon's or Mastro's, all of which I think are superior, but if those places are all booked, or for some reason you just want to visit the one that was here first, Ruth's Chris is still a pretty good steak."}
{"text":"I attended the second of Ruth's Taste Maker Dinners and WOW!! Everything pictured below was $95 which is a superb price point for all of the delicious food and wine consumed. Josh, of Ruth's Chris, did a fabulous job of making sure we were well taken care of. Maggie, the wine rep, was able to impart her vast knowledge of wine on the group and our wait staff, Rick and Ryan, made sure we receivers top notch service. There was a drawing for prizes toward the end of the evening. I WON!! Woot. There are more of these dinners each month. I cannot wait to learn more about wine and partake in fine dining in the future."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday for Madison Restaurant Week. Picked the Caesar salad to start...well done! My entree was the chicken which was a little overcooked and somewhat tough. Unable to taste the garlic in the mashed potatoes which were mushy and not as good as I've had at other places. Selected the seasonal berries with cream for dessert. Tiny portion which included a whopping three berries. Not worth the $35/person. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal, service and location. What a fantastic dinner we had. I didn't realize how much I missed the one that used to be on Chagrin Blvd. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few super expensive steak houses. Yet I have never been to a place that has steak that is this good. I also thought I have had some pretty amazing steaks before, but this was on another level. The lobster bisque was not the best, but good. The loaded baked potato and green beans were boring in comparison. The only side that wowed me was the sweet potato casserole. It is like a dessert, so if you are not into sweet, definitely pass on it. Speaking of dessert, I had the chocolate sin cake, which is a flourless dark chocolate cake with a hint of espresso. Again, not everyone's favorite. I liked it when paired with the strawberry they plated with it. All in all, I didn't feel ripped off at paying over $200 for a meal with no alcohol, which is saying a lot for a plebeian such as myself."}
{"text":"Food we have eaten here is OK and nothing special. Large meat portions if that is your thing. Salads are amazingly bad and I can get better from McDonalds or Wendy's. Ruth Chris thinks that a wedge of lettuce with some dressing dripped over it is a \"salad\".

The last time we had dinner here my friend and I both got food poisoning and that was with steak. Not about to trust the seafood. Never heard back from the managers after calling the restaurant the next day. From what I have heard from others that is standard procedure for this chain of franchisee operated places."}
{"text":"They have GOT TO update this place! The ambiance at this location is on par with a Sizzler's. Fortunately, the meal was good.

What we Had: (Party of three)

2 orders of crab salad (Awesome!) Just PURE fresh crabmeat, lemon, and a sort of \"Louie\" dipping sauce. MMMMmmmmm
1 order fried calamari
1 wedge salad
1 field greens with vinaigrette (YUM)
1 chopped salad
3 iced teas
steak
filet mignon
lobster (very good, tender not rubbery or over-cooked)
broccoli au gratin (Yum)
no dessert

Only got a glimpse of the bill, I think it was $261

{"text":"I love this upscale restaurant! They are truly consistently fabulous in food preparation and taste. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure you have a pleasant experience! Always look forward to 'next time' and will share with friends and family when they are in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak that was piping hot (500 degrees!!!), solid appetizers, sides, very friendly staff, love the location. 

I went recently for my 27th birthday and I loved everything about it. I loved their chocolate cake with icecream as a dessert as well. 

Thanks to my amazing husband who took me to this place and gave me an amazing birthday night out."}
{"text":"Celebrated our wedding anniversary....It was nothing short of spectacular. This high-end steakhouse is has deliciously seasoned steak, sleek dekor, and a glamorous clientele. Staff make you fill like family, especially their manager Hamidija  who made the event special and memorable. I have been to many steakhouses all over the world but this is the place I love coming back to with my friends as family."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first trip to Ruth's.  We used a Groupon coupon.  We'd never been here before because I knew it was pricey.  I didn't realize just how pricey.  Yikes!  

Our drink and appetizer orders were taken promptly.  Another employee came around with a tray with 2 large bottles of water on it.  He asked it we wanted one of these or tap water. He had a strong accent so was a bit tough to understand.  My husband chose a water but luckily I asked how much it was.  For $4.95, we decided we could both be happy with tap water. 

We started off with the stuffed mushrooms.  They were large and very tasty but we only got 4 for $12.50.  They weren't any better than the ones at Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  

My husband had the seared scallops ($28), which he said were excellent.  They were served over a bed of thin sliced zucchini and red peppers which looked wonderful.

I had the ribeye ($43, 16oz).  My steak was good but I think it must have had butter on it or something, as it was a bit greasy.  I ordered it medium rare but it was more on the rare side.  Luckily, I didn't mind but my husband, who likes his meat fairly well done, was grossed out.  The ribeye was only a couple bucks more than the 11oz filet & I was able to bring half home for another meal.  I'll probably be glad it was on the rare side when I reheat it.  Altho the steak was good, it wasn't exceptionally better than any other steak I've had, which I expected considering the price.

The meal includes a small loaf of fresh hot bread which was light and fluffy on the inside with a nicely crispy crust.  It does NOT include anything else,.  Salads or sides are extra.  The sides are large, so my husband and I shared the au gratin potatoes, which were very good ($8.50).

The service was very good and the manager came around to see how things were going.  It was cold in the room we were in but the cold air blowing thru the vents was promptly shut off when another diner made the request.  I had a big complaint about the ambiance as they were playing Xmas music non-stop.  A few tunes here and there would have been fine but not one right after another.  I asked if they could put on some different music but no change was ever made.  We were ready to leave by the time the manager came over, so I didn't bother to mention the music.

My husband seemed to be really impressed by the fact there was a TV in the men's room.  Guys never spend much time in the restroom so I found the TV rather funny.

Would we go back?  No.  I really didn't feel like we got enuf bang for our buck.  
At the prices they're charging for the main courses, a salad and side dish should be included.  The food just wasn't exceptional enough for the prices."}
{"text":"Great spot for a romantic birthday dinner. Staff were very pleasant, ambience sophisticated, and our server Jan was a delight! She was down to earth & willing to answer all our questions, so it didn't have an air of pretentiousness (unlike our experience at Harbour 60). 

(Random detail of note - the tables are on the larger side & seat 4, so most couples there were sat on adjacent sides rather than across from each other. Might matter if you're on a date!)

Steak - 4*: Got the 16oz Ribeye @ $65, med-rare. Though it was cooked nicely, it was a little less tender than I'd hoped. There was a little too much fat for me (however it is a well marbled cut, so perhaps that is more to do with my pref). Very flavourful and nicely garnished, it arrived (and stayed) sizzling for a good few mins! The butter enhanced it well but I wonder how flavourful the steak would be without it - my partner commented that the first few bites (i.e. buttery) were better than the rest. 

Side of potato au gratin - 2.5*: Disappointed! It's a fave dish & I thought it would pair fantastically with the steak. However it was topped with 1cm of cheddar, so you couldn't even see the shape of the potato slices underneath. Had to scoop it aside to reveal the under-seasoned potatoes. 

Dessert - 5*: They served us a complementary birthday slice of Chocolate Sin cake (with message & name written in choc - nice touch). 

Well slap my thigh and call me Charlie, this cake was AMAZING! Holy crap. I was expecting the same ol' boring choc cake, but instead we were pleasantly surprised with a delectable flourless chocolate creation from heaven. Textured like a truffle, tasted like dark semi-sweet chocolate, with a perfectly paired raspberry coulis. It's like an uber dense mousse, without the 'instant cocoa' flavour. We took the leftovers home to enjoy every single delicious calorie."}
{"text":"Heard so many people rave about it. The Keg is better. The meals were all very good, but for the price one expects amazing. Wouldn't go back. Service was great 

You can tell it's not just us who say it was MEH. The restaurant was half empty. Line ups outside out of every great restaurant in Toronto. 

Sorry, Ruth's Chris won't be back."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is my top favorite steakhouse in Charlotte, opposed to Peter Luger in NYC. The filet is IMPECCABLE. The charring is perfection and the bites are like butter in my mouth. It's cooked to the perfect consistency as well. Now, I'm a person that likes my food piping hot, and I am never dissapointed when that flaming hot steak arrives at my table. Fresh asparagus, Potatoes au gratin & the creamed spinach are great accompaniments.Don't forget to take a stab at the chocolate sin cake with a coffee at the end of your meal :) P.S. They have a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck on the happy hour tour...all I can say is WOW!  Fantastic service every time!"}
{"text":"This review is a little different.  I went with my parents who have a strict requirement that any items we eat must be halal for religious reasons.  We recently found out that Ruth's Chris will actually let you special request halal steaks for your party.  The process requires you to call at least two days in advance.  They will fax you an order form and charge your card $50 per steak (Their standard rate for the New York Strip).  Unfortunately, there are no other cuts of beef available for this special order.  It's the New York Strip or nothing at all.

Their service is excellent.  Right as we walked in, they confirmed our reservation and let us know that the chef was aware of our Halal meat request.  Once we were seated at our table, our waiter was extremely helpful and helped guide my parents through the menu to make sure they ordered according to their requirements (no alcohol in the food, no non-halal meat items, etc.).  Throughout our dinner, he came by to make sure we were all taken care of.  

The waiter reminded us that all the appetizers/sides are served in very generous portions and can easily be shared between a few people.  We started with the Escargot and Calamari.  The Escargot was more of an experiment on my part and my sister's since we have never tried it.  It was great, but I'm not sure if I'd go for it again.  I normally loathe seafood, but I must say - the calamari was the first time I had eaten any seafood item and liked it.  Let me rephrase that.  I loved the calamari.  Battered and fried to golden perfection and coated with this sweet red pepper sauce, served with lemon on the side.  Kudos to the chef for making a seafood dish that I was actually able to enjoy.  

For sides, we had the sweet potato casserole and steak fries.  The Sweet Potato dish was excellent, but better suited as a dessert.  The Steak Fries were great, but a bit pricey considering the quantity served.  Next time, we will probably go for veggies and mashed potatoes.

Only one word for the steak.  Glorious.  I've been to The Keg, Outback, and a few similar places in the States.  I can also make a pretty decent steak at home.  All of them pale in comparison to what they served to us.  Braised with butter and what I think was a rosemary rub.  The beef was a bit over an inch thick and probably weighed about 14 oz cooked.  The quantity was way more than any of us could eat and all I can think of now is when I can go back for more.  

As I mentioned already, the servings are huge and there were a lot of leftovers.  My suggestion for the leftover beef - slice it up into thin strips, carmelize some onions and heat the meat up on the pan.  Melt up some provolone and treat yourself to one of the best Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches you will ever eat.

Will I go back again?  I've already started saving for the next special occasion."}
{"text":"March 19, my birthday used a Xmas gift card. Made Open Table reservation more than month ago. Great banquette table overlooking room nice gesture with Happy Birthday on table. Great service by main waiter, Emiliano took lobster bisque off bill due to wife's disliking flavor, brought another soup for her to try but not liking as well. Shared beautiful 12oz ribeye to go with wedge salad and shoe string potatoes , that could have been crispier. Nice bottle of central coast cab and Birthday creme brûlée to top it off."}
{"text":"Best happy hour and the friendliest most talented bar service around. This gentleman named Todd makes the experience entertaining yet classy.
Definitely a top pick!"}
{"text":"We went to Ruth Chris steakhouse in Las Vegas last night before a show. The server could not really have been worse. The food was so disappointing! Ordering fillet's, we did not expect dry tough meet around the edges of a medium rare fillet, indicating that it has possibly been frozen. I have been going to Ruth Chris since I was a child in Florida in the 50s. I cannot even express how disappointing this is, and I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years, but will definitely be back soon. Great dining experience, great service. The sweet potato casserole is to die for!"}
{"text":"Visited here last Saturday as part of Winterlicious 2016 with my wife. The first sign of great service is that they didn't cancel my reservation when I called in notifying them we were running late. Thank you!

The first thing that struck me upon arrival was the smell - not necessarily a bad thing; but the smell of seared steak and melted butter fills the place. The place is fairly compact and underground, so that might explain it.

Our server, Glen, was terrific throughout. The place was packed and you knew he (and everyone else) was busy, but he didn't let it show and was very helpful, attentive and charismatic. Credit to the bus boy who was maybe the hardest working person in the whole place. Throughout the night, service was impeccable and we weren't rushed nor left waiting long for anything.

Glen recommended the spicy lobster bites (I believe they were called) and was a great call. It was actually a fairly generous portion of several pieces of lobster tail in a creamy chilli sauce. The lobster meat was so sweet and had a great sear around the surface whilst perfectly cooked in the middle. I ordered an Erdinger to drink and it was an absolutely perfect pour.

My wife and I both ordered from the Winterlicious menu. For starters, we went with caesar salad and the soup with chorizo (forgot the name). I like how the sides comes out on a side plate, so it works out perfectly for sharing. We went with the creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. With both went for the steak naturally. The spinach was pretty good, albeit a bit unspectacular. The mashed potatoes may have been the low point of the meal as they were too creamy and lacking taste.

I knew ahead that the steak size would be smaller for the event; and when they came out, they certainly screamed 'promo' given how much smaller they were than the others being served around us. However, they can't be faulted for that, and was still a good serving size, so long as I wasn't comparing. Most importantly, they were still delicious and almost melt in your mouth as friends told us about. A slight critique would be that both of our steaks could've passed for the next cooked level, though they were far from ruined and they was only slightly more cooked than desired.

We ended up with three desserts total rather than two which came with the menu, since we also received one for my wife since it was her birthday. They make them in house, and I loved all of them: flourless chocolate cake, key lime pie, and the fantastic cheesecake (yes, we did take some to go).

As a side note, I did go through the menu and it is indeed very expensive and possibly not the greatest value. Our bill over $150 for two drinks, and appetizer and the Winterlicious menu was fair, but I didn't feel was a steal by any means. I imagine a regular bill would feel a little steep. 

Still, we loved our night and a great deal of highlights. I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"Service is spectacular, and i guess it better be when your paying 50+ bucks for your meal but I just don't get it, I really don't. Every little thing we ordered left me wondering. steaks come out swimming in butter, yes that's heavenly but that's doesn't make it a nice meal and it certainly doesn't justify the price!"}
{"text":"Ruths Chris, Ruths Chris, Ruth Chris..you never and i mean NEVER EVER disappoint me.

When i heard they were opening a Ruths Chris here in cleveland i got so giddy, all my memories of Ruths Chris is Weehawken, NJ and Princeton, NJ came rushing back.

Saturday night and feeling fine, it had just opened so it was jam packed. But long hair dont care because i knew it was worth it

The intimate atmosphere, dim lighting, exceptional service, all led me up to the best meal (steak wise) ive probably ever had!

i always order the porterhouse medium well, the combination of filet mignon and new york strip is my sinful combination. Pair it with some creamed spinach, the candied sweet potatoes and you literally have heaven on a dish.

my favorite thing about this establishment, and trust me i can name 1000s, is that they serve the food to you on piping hot plates, to keep your meal hot for the entire duration of your meal. GENIUS.

The menu has a little bit of something for everybody, even children. The service at this particular one was outstanding. My cup didnt even reach halfway before our server was on her way to fill it up again. 

Price wise you better come prepared to shell out a pretty penny, but its 100% worth it. You get amazing service, and the best steak money can buy. Of course they sell seafood and other items but how do you go to Ruths Chris STEAKHOUSE and order a salad? NO THANKS!

They do take reservations so i highly recommend this feature.

10/10 Ruths Chris Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"We were there for our big anniversary.  We have been to other Ruth's Chris steakhouses - Hong Kong, Denver.  The atmosphere was so terrible - An older man was making propositions to a young boy who obviously has some mental problems.  He was almost sitting on the young boy's lap - asking him to sign some papers later in the evening.  The older man was despicable.  He was talking very loudly and it absolutely ruined our evening.  The rest of the patrons also seemed to lack any knowledge of proper restaurant etiquette.  
When we were offered a dessert for our anniversary, we quickly asked for the check and ran out of there.  If someone wants a nice dining experience, the patrons of this restaurant will not  provide the atmosphere to achieve this goal"}
{"text":"Simply Lovely. 

We had dinner on a weekday and had a great experience. Our waiter, Malcolm, was great and added a special touch to an already great evening. 

We began the evening with Blueberry Mojitos and the Shrimp Voodoo. Malcolm recommended the shrimp and I am very happy we ordered it, it tasted amazing!

My husband and I then shared the Tomahawk Ribeye with asparagus and Shoestring fries. I can't begin to describe the steak, it was perfect, very flavourful and the perfect texture (we ordered medium rare). The asparagus were yummy and very well cooked. I was a bit disappointed with the fries (they weren't warm enough), but to be honest we shouldn't have ordered them, the steak and asparagus were enough.  

For wine, we ordered the Terra Malbec. 

We were tempted with the dessert menu and ordered both the Chocolate Duo and the Chocolate Sin Cake. Both amazing, order the duo if you have a sweet tooth and the sin cake if you prefer something that is richer. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday and when booking the reservation he specifically told them it was for a milestone birthday. The service was not great by our waiter he didn't seem to care and seemed kind of rushed and impatient with us. By the time we paid the waiter knew it was my birthday but did not acknowledge or bring me a dessert I said fine whatever maybe they don't do that here. So yesterday I went back here with my in laws , not even one week later, for my brother in laws birthday and they bring him a dessert. It just doesn't seem right that my husband spend 300 plus dollars and we got terrible service and they didn't make my birthday special at all. But if you're going to give birthday desserts and acknowledgement to some and not all than that is not fair. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious, which truthfully is one of the only ways we could afford to eat here and try more than one item on the menu.  I'm thankful the restaurant participates in this program.  I've always wanted to try out the food.

The restaurant is in the basement of the hotel so there is no natural light.  The decor is fairly old fashioned, a bit surprisingly so.  Not so much old steakhouse as old restaurant.  The servers seemed to have been here a long time too - it is definitely a mature establishment, and caters to one as well.

We both had salad and sizzling steaks, that were interesting.  Food was all good quality and our server helped us with some good suggestions on what to eat.  Sides are shared, so we tried a couple.  

Overall, I enjoyed this place but hesitate to give it more than 3 stars because I don't see the value.  It's a fairly expensive steakhouse and there are cheaper and equally as tasty options in the area.  But if you end up here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about Ruth's Chris, I was glad I had the opportunity to finally try one. I was not disappointed. I had a good steak, with good food and good service. Nothing about it falls into the great category. 
The service was less than perfect, we had one meal out early which was allowed to go cold. Our waiter had the opportunity to fix this when he noticed, but instead he removed it from the table then brought back the same plate 15 minutes later with cold Inedible scallops. Also, we were constantly running out of water to drink. 
They did not appear short staffed, just inexperienced. 
Food was good. I ordered a mango sorbet for dinner that was out of this world. 
For the price which is top in, it was not a top end experience. But it certainly was good, thereby earning the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location many times and always enjoyed it. The food is always excellent and whenever there is a minor problem, they fix it immediately. The staff are superb, from the bussers up to the managers, who are always friendly and attentive. The food is expensive, but not for the quality. The steak are top notch, and the sides are a healthy size (big enough to share ) and tasty, so for what you receive, the prices are fine. The bananas foster is a decadent dessert choice, and enjoyable to watch the waiters make it tableside, particularly since many of them argue over who makes it the best;.  Also, the decor is elegant and the restaurant is quiet, so you can enjoy a peaceful and elegant meal without the clamor and noise of some other places. All in all an excellent place to have a great steak.  In fact, I have eaten at many other \"prime\" high end steakhouses, and find Ruths to be the most consistent in delivering a delicious quality meal and good service.  I believe they are open until 1 or 2 am now also, which is nice."}
{"text":"The steaks are generally excellent, although on this last visit the cut of meat in my filet was questionable - it tasted more like liver. The sides were good - I enjoyed the crisp steamed string beans.
  The service is absolutely perfect. I had a reservation, and after I arrived, everyone who came to my table used my name.
  The location is odd - in an office building with no real pedestrian access. It's so close to the Biltmore area, it seems like that would have been a better location. The decor is professional and befitting the class of restautant."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, excellent bartender!!!!  I love to go again soon."}
{"text":"Let's face it, if you're in Vegas you're here to treat yourself. If you happen to have won some money, even better. Ruth's Chris is a great place to treat yourself and your friends. There are steakhouses in almost every casino resort on the Strip, but I've found that Ruth's Chris Steakhouse at Harrah's is one of the most consistent and delicious steakhouses in Vegas. The classic ribeye, cowboy ribeye, and filet are all amazing. All cuts are USDA prime grade beef from the Midwest so it's sure to be tender. Don't forget to also treat yourself to an old fashioned, fine scotch or glass of Pinot Noir. Best of all, the wonderful food and drink is brought to you by some of the most pleasant staff in town. Server Dollianne will make you feel like a million bucks even if you didn't win a million at the slots and tables. Be sure to make a reservation;  the dinner service is very popular."}
{"text":"First time here at Ruth's Chris and I am celebrating my 25th Birthday.

The ambiance is really nice and intimate. Very spacious and its on the 2nd floor of The Harrahs so you kind of get a view of the strip.

I ordered the Filet Medium Oscar Style and my GF ordered the Ribeye Medium with Bleu Cheese crust.

The filet Oscar style was really good, nice and tender and the asparagus was still crunchy. The crab meat was a little too fishy for me but still good. My GF's ribeye was really good as well nice and tender cut like butter.

Overall the food was good, but I think it was overpriced. 

They didn't make me feel special as if it were my birthday, our server even checked my ID and didn't say happy birthday until we finally told her it was.

For those of you who haven't tried Ruths Chris I suggest you try it once."}
{"text":"Came here for a nicer dinner during one of our weekends without the kiddos. We decided to sit outside on the patio, which was a really nice area. It was quiet and the temp was right (super cold inside - bring a sweater). While we enjoyed the patio and it's vibe I think our service suffered a but for it. It took a while to get refills and several times we had to ask for them. The steaks were well cooked and flavored as were the sides. It is a solid place to come for dinner and maybe sitting inside amps up the service?!"}
{"text":"As you can tell from my other reviews, I have frequented Ruth's Chris Steak House locations all over the country. Overall, this experience was on-par with other locations. The food is consistent. We ordered a petite filet and stuffed chicken breast with the usual sides and found the steak was well prepared and all of our dishes were good. We had some type of banana pudding desert and it wasn't one of the best we have had at a Ruth's Chris. We sat by a window and had a great view of the strip. The service was a bit slow and our server was less than attentive (refills were slow, etc.) but we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a huge deal. One of the biggest disappointments, at least to me: the soup of the day was some type of a seafood soup as was the regular menu soup. I would have preferred to see an alternative to a seafood soup offered, just a personal thought.

The restaurant is located in Harrah's and it was a bit difficult for us to find. You have to take an elevator that is in the middle of the Harrah's casino. If you follow the signs, you will be fine. We overheard the waiter telling another table that this is the largest Ruth's Chris in the nation, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily felt any different than other locations, other than perhaps being a bit more casual."}
{"text":"Upscale steakhouse with excellent service. The food is great as well but be ready to pay for it. It is worth the money however! 

Wines were a good price and excellent with the steak! 

Dishes are hot, they are cooked up to 500 degrees! 

The servers are great and will do whatever they can to make your dinner pleasant! 

Must tries are the trio dish with the tomahawk steak!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Ruth's Chris last night for her birthday and it was fantastic.  You are treated well from beginning to end and the filet is possibly the best steak I've eaten.  I will be returning for sure.  Class Act Experience."}
{"text":"With no family in town, we made Ruth's Chris our \"X-mas dinner spot\"!  I made reservations for my husband and I for 5pm on Dec 23. We arrived, were seated at a place for 2 and I was surprised the place was not packed this evening. It never seemed to get more than 3/4 full which was nice as the service was fantastic. Something about having 5 or so waiters helping you with everything; water, bread, bus boys, main waiter, food server, etc. I still do not like the carpet in this place - I think they can afford to go with hard wood? I had this same feeling the last time I was in for lunch and still feel that way! We ordered a drink to start, beer and a vodka tonic. We also ordered a very nice bottle of wine from Argentina, a Malbec. $46 for the bottle. I found out that you can bring your own wine here but there in a $40 corking fee. Ouch!  Crab cakes were ordered to start. I liked them a lot - the crab was lump so you could really taste it without a lot of filler. A little cool in the centre but we gobbled them up. We also ordered the \"Full meal\" - included, you can have a salad, entree and a side dish. Good value. I had petite filet rare, and scallops with asparagus and my husband ordered petite filet med. rare with garlic mashed potatoes. We both ordered the caesar salads which were very good, fresh cheese grated on top, not too dressed and served on COLD plates, yay! (nice that we could sub the caesars for the listed house salad, no extra charge) The steaks come out hot on 500 degree plates doused in butter! So good, we both loved the steaks, cooked perfectly. I loved my scallops as well. I guess since by the time we ordered coffees, we were teetering on the $200 mark for dinner and we were offered free desserts!!!! Or it could have been just out of the server's kind regard that it was in fact out X-mas dinner! I got the apple crisp pie a la mode and it was huge! That went in the leftover bag with half my dinner! Hubby got the banana cream pie and he loved it. He had to take half home as well. He loved the real little bananas on top! He also had leftovers from dinner. We learned that the desserts were made in house. Bonus mark for that! NOTE: the side dishes are quite large and we were impressed! Overall, we left very happy and very full and our plans for a movie afterwards got sidelined by a lay-down on the couch at home! I would have given it a 5 star rating but yep, the carpet in there annoys me as mentioned and the server had no idea what the Specials were nor soup of the day and had to keep going to the back to the kitchen to ask. We will be back though!"}
{"text":"A decent steak house...

The appetizers were okay. We've had the calamari, which was the standard you'd find at most restaurants. But the mushrooms stuffed with crab meat were delicious. As for the steaks, filets are usually small, but at Ruth's Chris Steak House, they are especially small. The seasoning and spices on the steak weren't all that special either. So, my only experience here was an extremely expensive and unsatisfying dinner.

Service, on the other hand, was impeccable. I'll give credit for that."}
{"text":"This is the first Ruth's Chris I've been to and the food was worth the visit. We made reservations and arrived early and were seated within a few minutes. They had a special going (Restaurant Week) on that offered a 3 course meal for a fixed price, which worked well if you were interested in the options on that menu since every dish is ordered separately (salad, entree, side - as expected from an upscale restaurant). 

The service was slow and sporadic at times or just MIA all together, I just check it off as it being Friday night and busy. The food took awhile to come out but it was sizzling hot and of course the steak is served on the hot plate so it keeps the steak warm, the chefs can cook it to the temperature you ask for. The garlic mash potatoes and creamed spinach are a MUST HAVE - it's practically dessert! All around good experience for a special night out.

Would recommend to anyone interesting in a decent dining experience for special occasions or just out for the night with your special one."}
{"text":"Made a reservation to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Busy on a Saturday night.  Sat in the lounge for about 10 minutes first and a friendly bartender made a delicious girly fruity cocktail for me and an old fashioned for my hubby.

We were then seated in the dining area.  Ordered the filet mignon and the rib steak with Caesar salad and roasted yellow tomato bisque to start.  They served this warm crispy baguette slices in a cloth covered basket on the table while you peruse the menu.  Crispy, chewy, tasty bread with butter is so good!!

Salad and soup were good.  The steaks came with loaded hash brown potatoes and asparagus sides.  Steak as always is cooked perfectly served on a sizzling hot plate with melted butter.  Filet melts in your mouth and rib eye is so tasty.  No other steak in town comes close to a Ruth Chris steak, seriously.

Loaded hash browns were a disappointment.  Barely warm hash brown potatoes with a dollop of sour cream and bacon bits in the middle.  The manager came to check on us and was really great about taking it back and getting us a hotter serving.  Second portion was much better temperature wise but I would likely stick to fries or baked potato next time.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and came with this delicious light hollandaise. 

Finished with a really great cappuccino.  They took the hashbrowns off the bill which was really nice of them.  Service was faultless and friendly.  Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just to treat yourself to the best steak in town when the mood hits!"}
{"text":"let's be serious ..... it's Ruth's Chris, how could I be disappointed?  My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner there and except for a small hiccup (my father-in-law had said we could NOT go over 2 hours, without exception, and our dessert had been held up because my hubby and I were giving our bridal party gifts and speeches and the staff didn't want to interrupt so we never got our dessert .... it was promptly removed from my in-laws' bill without question or hesitation), the service, food, and atmosphere was amazing.  We, along with the in-laws, dealt solely with Chelsea Helstab (sales and catering manager) and she couldn't have been more responsive. The wait staff that night was so on-point .... available whenever we needed them, refilling drinks quickly, yet never seemed to be hovering or there \"too much\".  It's pricey but for a special event like this? You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I did have a good steak, and this chain has always been a go-to if you have an expense account or are ready to drop a bundle. The $70 tasting menu was adequate. I did ask for bread and the response was, \"I can get bread for you.\" Really? You can? My hero! The problem is Las Vegas - the often weirdly friendly or edgy labor pool and the design and planning for imports to a city where less is never heard of, and more is more. When the dessert came, a spoon larger than any soup spoon I'd ever seen accompanied it. I mentioned it to the people I was chatting with as well as the bar server. \"Well, I've been here for three years and nobody has ever complained about the spoon.\" Okay, I expressed myself clearly to indicate that I was not pleased. To show how off-base the whole scene was, later the server/bar guy and a cohort returned with tiniest spoon in the house. Very funny - they thought!! I guess it was a spoon for cocktail sauce. I suggested 'coke'. Besides, who eats chocolate cake with a giant spoon? Bottom line: room is pleasant with big view of strip. With wine, which is way overpriced, expect to pay at the very least $125 pp with tax and tip, likely more if you are hungry."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews ever but I had to make an exception.  My wife and I got engaged at Ruth Chris in South Park 3 years ago.  We visit Ruth Chris at least twice a year.  We have had the good fortune of meeting Nate and Jamaar through our visits over the years.  They both worked yesterday and using the word exceptional does not give them justice for our experience.  They brought my daughter some fruit to the table without us asking because they remembered she liked blueberry, blackberry and raspberry medley.  They continued to check on us and when we were done they had them pull our car upfront to the door and made sure to put the AC on high because it was 100 degrees outside.  The icing on the cake \"literally\" is that they even put a to go desert in the passenger seat of my car.  If you ever get a chance to experience the Ruth Chris in Charlotte be sure to ask for Nate and Jamaar.  Tell them Ty Norwood sent you to ensure you get the royal treatment.  I will be back again soon.  The steak and the stuffed chicken breast are the best.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Horrible. Too Much Salt. No Heart in their food. No Passion for their craft.  This steak house should be taken off any \"top 10\" lists for Steak in the GTA. Our server was great so there was no problem there.  However, you come for the steak and the atmosphere and the lounge is wwwaaayy to dark and the food was extremely salty.

Also...how the hell do you mess up Sauteed Mushrooms?!?!?!  This place did....it seemed like they just boiled them and threw some sauce on it.  At least their mash potatoes out of the box came out decent.

The steaks are served sizzling on a plate loaded with butter....but also for whatever reason they love to put salt in everything!

I will definitely not be coming back here.  I shoulda drove the extra hour to Smith Brothers instead.  Save your money and go for Pizza."}
{"text":"Well, what a disappointment! We went there because of several positive reviews from my husband's coworkers. I love meat and 90% of the time I order meat in the restaurants. This is not the place to eat good steak/fillet mignon unless you like your meat floating in butter.

What kind of steak house is this? They don't offer a single sauce with their meat! The meat itself was just fine, nothing special. I didn't like my sizzling plate with a boiling steak in it... Bring me sizzling meat in a different plate if you want to show that you just cooked it. 
Potato side dishes are horrific in their size. They don't give you a human portion along with your steak; you have to order it separately, and the portion they bring is good for at least 3 people. If you want mashed potato and your date/partner/etc wants to have e.g. potato gratin, you have to order 2 separate side dishes (around $7 for each or something in that range), which are big enough to feed 6 people. We didn't even finish our meals. 
Oh, and some people sitting there were acting as if it's the fanciest place on earth. It's not, believe me.  I had better fillet mignon at Christopher Fermier. 
Save your time and money unless you like your food soaked in butter."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is absolutely one of the best steak places around. 

We came here for a family member's Birthday and love all the little things they did to make it special. Our Italian born server Francisco was both attentive and mildly amusing. He produced a mini LED flashlight at one point when one of us couldn't see the menu. LOL

We started with some wine, a fruit and rosemary flavored Martini, along with some salads and a beef Carpaccio (see photos). All were very good.  The Carpaccio came in the shape of a pineapple, with the most mild and flavorful parmigiano-reggiano cheese I've ever had. It was a good start. 

We weren't rushed and our water glasses were topped off without any fuss. We sat near the back window, enjoying the view of the patio and McCormick-Stillman Park. There was a beautiful harvest-like moon over head. 

For dinner we ordered the halfed Chicken, 16 oz Filet Mignon and the 22oz Cowboy Ribeye. All very very good, but my ribeye was undercooked. One of the servers took it away but it came back on the other side of medium, minus the table scraps for the pups. LOL

Ruth's Chris is famous for cooking their steaks in a 1800° oven, so the one thing you don't want to do is over cook it. I give them credit for offering me another steak, but I declined. They did insist however we allow them to buy us dessert, which we did accept. All in all, it was a good meal and we had a nice time. See the Birthday cakes photos. 

Ruth's is at the high end of the steakhouse price point, so expect to pay $75 to $90 each, including taxes and gratuity."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we've been to Ruth Chris Steak Houses in many locations and almost without exception, we've had good experiences. We also ate numerous times at The Range before it was converted to a Ruth's Chris. And we always had great food and excellent service there. However, our two dining experiences at this Ruth's Chris have been disappointing. The service was fine in both cases, but the food wasn't. Both times, my steak came out incorrectly prepared. I know that a medium rare steak has a 'cool red center' .... not a squishy purple / red center. The last time we were there -- on New Year's Eve -- my husband's steak was properly prepared. Mine was squishy and purple inside. I sent it back and they then cooked it to medium well. So they then prepared a new one and it came out with gristle in several spots. Not what you expect for the price. But by then, my husband was almost done with his meal and I didn't want to send it back again so I just ate it. They did make the changes graciously but given the experience and the fact that it was New Year's Eve, I think it would have been appropriate to offer something else, whether a desert or to comp drinks or something. There are too many great steakhouses in Vegas for us to ever come back to this one."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to yelp this place!!  My wife and I went for our first anniversary. The staff was amazing!  They didn't even blink an eye when two women came in celebrating their wedding. We ordered champagne. Of course we got the cheapest bottle on the menu. The manager came and told us they were out of that one, but would we mind this ($120) bottle?  Uh yea!  Hand it over!  
Our food was RC quality all the way. Not a single complaint. And then complimentary dessert!!  
I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"All of the steaks at our table were overdone. Also, we were one of the last parties in the restaurant and they turned on the lights like it was last call at a dive bar to get us to leave. Not impressed especially for the price point."}
{"text":"The smell alone when you walk in the door is worth the price! Amazing steak! Jeff our server was fantastic even though we had two children, split a meal, and ordered no cocktails! Jeff was super professional and did an amazing job! Crab shack was super delicious! I had the strip steak cooked perfectly mom has the filet super tender and cooked perfectly! Dad had crab legs and loved them! Lava cake and chocolate mousse dessert, my favorite we're amazing! Only ding was the 3 \"family style\" side dishes, not enough for me alone let alone the family! Otherwise super restaurant and worth the Price."}
{"text":"I love restaurants that offer outdoor seating. Arizona is the best place for them. Spectacular view of the sunset on this evening. The food and presentation were on point."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves cold steaks and warm beer. 
Seriously the worst steak I've ever had in my life.
the staff is bush league trash. I am certain that none of these people have ever worked in a fine dining establishment of any kind. Ruth Chris is a chain restaurant. TGIFriday's for suits. GARBAGE."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?   They just do it right. From the very Southern hospitality(without the accent, but good,still) to the fanatastic food. I had a perfect New York Strip, cooked perfectly medium rare,with the bourbon/pepper sauce on the side(it does not get better than this)., to the unbelieveable wine list (a very nice 2002 Cosentino, The Poet)  My guests enjoyed their food and a good time was had by all.    Still one of my favorite restaurants.  Wish the others in this chain compared."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review:  we have eaten at Ruth Chris on several different occasions over the years and have had phenomenal experiences prior to today.  

My husband and I decided to take advantage of the Charlotte Restaurant Week special for my birthday dinner at the South Park location today.  In the past, we've ordered off the regular priced menu. My favorite is the bone-in cowboy ribeye (normally $55.00 or more). Always butter meltingly tender and has the wonderful \"char.\"  We thought, \"let's take advantage of the special discounted price for the Queen's Feast,\" even though the 14 oz ribeye has a $10.00 up charge ($45.00).  Boy, were we both disappointed...we thought the purpose of Restaurant week was to showcase the menu and quality of the restaurant so patrons would like to come back and experience their regular menu.  Based on their performance tonight, we would not have returned. 

The ribeye looked very pretty but was not butter meltingly tender and we both ordered ours at medium rare. It was a definite downgrade on their \"normal\" steaks. It was chewy and dry. Our sides were good (wedge salad, garlic potatoes and sautéed mushrooms) but the dessert (cheesecake) tasted dry and store bought. We did splurge on a $100.00 bottle of wine which was up to Chris Ruth's normal standards. 

In our opinion, save your time and money and forego their restaurant week specials.  Go during their regular menu and experience the REAL steaks, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"first time here, was for restaurant week. my husband and i both had the caesar salad, delicious. next i had the seafood trio- 5 oz lobster tail, scallops and shrimp  - very good but my scallops were over cooked a bit. my waitress offered to bring more  i said it was ok  the manager came over to talk to me about it. told him that it was just a little overcooked, it was okay, i just expected more. He wanted me to have a perfect scallop, so he ordered more for me , and they were perfect.  my husband had the steak filet and shrimp. very tender.For  Dessert I had the sin chocolate cake- and my husband had the honey cinnamon cheesecake with peach compote. I gave then 5 stars because they fixed the scallops, otherwise it would have been 4 stars"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Sunday and came back Tuesday night. The service was great both times. The sides and apps were consistent. We had the spicy shrimp, mac, and mashed potatoes. Which we devoured. 

BUT... This is where I'm torn. The steaks were cooked and seasoned WAY better on Sunday than tonight. Which was super disappointing... the lobster and shrimp were also lacking in flavor tonight. Was there a different chef tonight? Hmm..


Still a good experience. Just an observation"}
{"text":"It's hard to put into words how much I love this place. To put things in perspective I took a picture of my first steak there, and had it as my facebook profile pic for YEARS!

When they first appeared in Mississauga I would come here at least once a week for a whole summer. It's that good. I would probably continue to go weekly if it weren't for my fear of rising cholesterol. 

Lets get down to the science of it all. 

Firstly, get the rib eye people. It's perfectly marbled, giving it tender buttery awesomeness, and features a bit of the rib eye cap. It's considered the best cut for these reasons. 

Imagine with me if you will a hefty portion of perfectly marbled rib eye, thick and filling the plate with it's presence. Nothing else on the plate to distract you from the absolute beauty of the beast. Nothing else deserves to be plated next to this work of art. Served on a crazy hot plate, and covered in butter. Now the butter deserves special attention, because it's genius how the butter BROWNS under the heat of the plate as it is sitting in front of you. That's steak science people! Brown butter is awesome. Look it up if you don't know what it is.

This will be the most manly meal of your life. The steak is served sizzling, so much so you have to sit back, and might need to hold up your napkin to protect you from the crackling butter. This steak knows how to make an entrance, and wants you to know who is boss. I love this part because it addresses an often overlooked part of the dinning experience. And by this I mean offering dinners an EXPERIENCE, not just food. You will feel the heat of your plate, you will fear getting burned by the sizzling butter, you will be filled with the delightful aroma of browning butter/steak. 

Even the sides are heavy, and focused. They are simply prepared with no new age, fancy, trendy crap. Just good quality sides. Can't go wrong with any of the choices they are all good. And same go with the desserts, but I doubt you will have space for it after eating a steak and side. You can get it to go. You will feel full, and high off the butter. 

Some will be concerned with price, but it's reasonable when considering how expensive other trendy steak places are downtown, and the classy experience. Also they have a lunch menu, and an \"early bird\" dinner menu that is cheaper than their full dinner menu. I believe they deliver on value, which is very important to me. 

Another concern you may have is your health. Pro tip: you can get the steak with reduced or no butter. Now you have no excuse. Go now."}
{"text":"Wait was long even though we had reservations my steak wad delicious and there creamed spinach umumum everyone in the party seemed to enjoy there food although someone ordered the pork chops and said it was very dry. But the steak and salmon was very good and our water glass wasn't refilled promptly in my opinion..."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times and have always had a wonderful experience. My husband prefers his steaks well done...with ketchup (YES, I know....) and never do they make him feel funny about it and they ALWAYS cook it perfectly. Our last visit I had the chilean sea bass. That is a fish that is so easy to overcook and mine was PERFECT.  The salads are always served chilled and the hot dishes are always always hot. 

Can't go wrong with the potatoes au gratin though any one of the side dishes will do because they are all yum. Desserts are also delicious but usually we are so full from dinner that we just can't make dessert work. 

The staff is attentive, friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. That's a biggie for me. Some servers just want to be besties and I just want to eat....

Definitely recommend this location and be sure to set a reservation or it'll be a long wait!"}
{"text":"I just left and I was very disappointed in the taste & service. I ordered the petite filet medium rare. It came back well done and had a very \"game like taste\". I sat with the steak on my plate with only a couple bites taken the whole meal and the waiter never asked me about the taste or why it wasn't eaten. They took it away without asking me and sent out the bill. Although my husbands steak was ok, we both agreed we'd never go back."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks!!!!
Only thing is everything is alacarte. So you pay for every side you want.
We had a non window view but it was fine.
The place looks very elegant n I felt we were underdressed....
Good service, offered different items and described the cooking process. 
Offered different cocktails and a wine list. 
Reasonably price for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"All that needs to be said is Yum. I have been to the one in Walnut Creek and now in LV.  Same excellent service. Great T-bone. And the Lobster Mac & Cheese is off the hook."}
{"text":"I'm a long time Ruth's Chris fan but walked out of the Scottsdale location this past Saturday (8pm) after being completely ignored for 10 minutes.  My fiancé and I had dropped in without a reservation and were offered patio or bar which was perfectly fine (we had no expectation of being seated in the dining room).  But after not even being acknowledged let alone offered a drink after 10 minutes by wait staff that I could reach out and touch was too much for the money.  We proceeded down the road to Mastro's Ocean Club and had a wonderful meal and a wonderful time.  I'm sure if we were in the dining room it would have played out better.  And I'm certain we'll be back to Ruth's Chris, but with all the fine dining options in Scottsdale, I probably won't take a chance on the Scottsdale location again."}
{"text":"Saturday was my birthday shenanigan. And I have called Ruth's Chris to up my no# of guests like 3x, yet every time. They were able to accommodate me.. We arrived around 8pm even though our reservation at 7:45. Our table wasn't quite ready til 8:15/8:20pm. 
All seated and was hosted by Micheal, Tony and Jon helped a little. All my ladies are happy with their meals. The French martinis were the bomb. My petite T bone was nicely done.. and the side was Brussels sprout and lobster Mac and cheese. We also have a sweet potatoes casserole. Complimentary from the chef. Love it.. I have been at Ruth's Chris in awhile and they're one of the big chains that doesn't disappoint every time you visit.. customer services are always consistent and of course there's a high standard there when it come to food."}
{"text":"When i was in Vegas, me and my friends wanted to eat good so we tried the Ruth's Chris here on Flamingo down the street from RIO.  To start off, my roommate Eugene wore a wife beater shirt and they would NOT let us in!! I was like \"wth??\"....Even i was wearing a beater as well but because i'm a girl, it's acceptable and for him it's not?? Whatever...anyhow, Eugene ended up wearing one of my girly fuschia cardigans in!! LOL!! it was SOOOOOOOO funny!! they let us in and us 4 ate there.  The girly cardigan was stretched beyond belief but it was fine with me because i was going to throw it away anyhow.  The host sat us down with a dirty look.  What a snotty girl.  Don't they want to make more money??  Anyways, i ordered their filet mignon and it was not even done right, i asked for it rare medium and they thought i was retarded until i explained it to them.  At first the waiter kind of snappy with me and said \"we only do it medium rare, that's what you're talking about, correct?\"....i said to him \"i want it more rare than medium and that's why i said rare medium and not medium rare\".  I think he got offended or something.  I'm no chef by any means but i told them that i would like it about 125-130 degrees farenheit if that makes it easier for the chef.  I said it in the most genuinely and sincere way but i still don't think he appreciated me telling him. LOL, whatevers...i was having a good time watching my friend act gay with my hot pink cardigan on. hahahaha, The steak turned out whatevers.  Service was rude, food was overpriced and not even made close to my liking.  The one in Orange County is SOOO much better, they actually care about their customers and the chefs take pride in their cooking skills.  We left them a good $25 tip for our $100 bill, but i also left a lil note letting them know that they should lighten up a bit ;)  Oh, and if you're the owner/manager at this specific Ruth's Chris and you're reading my review, tell your host that works there on sunday nights that i think she needs to take a break and relax already!!! ::))"}
{"text":"Best birthday dinner! Great food I had the chicken with potatoes au gratin. Also got the spicy lobster. Finished it off with the cheesecake. Great service nice strip view"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour last night and I had the best steak sandwich I've ever had!

The bread is very tasty and chewy.  It actually holds up to the task and doesn't become a soggy mess you're trying to keep together by the end.  The steak wasn't too dry and the bearnaise sauce was also very excellent.  You get perfectly cooked and seasoned fries with it too, all for $8.  This is such a great deal, I can't believe I never did this til last night!

Service was also pretty awesome.  We actually hung out a bit even after the check was taken and they offered us waters.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"This chain has been around for a long time, and are doing things right evidently. Food is good of course and service is above par. My recommendation is that they are more constant with their drink prices. I ordered a rum straight up, single. I ordered it with only 2 rocks but they filled up my glass with ice. That's just about service. Where i was surprised was when i was charged $20 for a french martini. My single cost $10 and hers cost $20. Again, good food, experience, and service.  Even if you have money to spend, a $20 for a single vodka shot drink, is just shy of \"really?\"."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed with this place.  There were 6 of us, we made reservations.  It's off the strip, nice get away from the hustle.  We cab'd over since there is no way you could walk here. 

Since I'm in Vegas I know this is Sommelier heaven, I asked for their head Sommelier, he's there.  Great.  I tell him who I am and what I'm doing while we wait for our table to be prepared.  He's fabulous.  He shows me around, takes me to the cellar, talks to me about his cellar management and ordering procedures.  I'm floating on cloud nine.  We come out, he shows me the private cellar area, uh oh, our table's ready, my family is seated.  

We give our order, the Som comes back over, checks on us to see how we're doing.  We get champagne, we look around we didn't order it, wow great.  

Our steaks were pristine, melt in your mouth, properly prepared.  The servers were on their game.  Nothing about my experience here was bad.  It was all good.  Totally not what I expected but all top notch.  Now I have eaten at Ruth Chris in 3 states and this occasion by far get's top billing."}
{"text":"Uptown steakhouse.  Cannot count how many times I've been.  Yes, somewhat pricey unless grazing at happy hour or on someone else's tab.  The service is always impeccable and when the occasional misstep occurs (which is rare), they step up and resolve quickly.

For a large chain-type restaurant they do very well, but I've had better steaks at lesser price.  My last dinner was a 16 oz ribeye for $49 plus sides.  That's $49/pound.  Although cooked to order, modern beef just doesn't taste like it did when I was raised on the farm.  Too few grass-fed cows in lieu of quickly grown, steroid injected, genetically engineered bovines masquerading as the real deal.  But, we had a wonderful time and I say give 'em a whirl."}
{"text":"If you like paying $59.00 for a ribeye that's overcooked, plus watery mac n cheese and watery creamed spinach, this is you're place. They've fallen by the wayside with the other previously great steakhouses - cutting corners and serving sub-parr quisine. The quality of the beef sucks, the execution sucks and the side items suck. What a scam. And ... since when does a Manhattan cocktail get made with Domain De Canton? REALLY? Also loved dining with t-shirt clad Millenials who haven't the slightest clue regarding fine cuisine. I think Ruth's Chris should market to these imbeciles and change their sign to \"Sizzler.\" Oops, they already did."}
{"text":"Dominic and Jason at the bar were fantastic! Both very nice and fun to have dinner with. They suggested items on the menu that were great. We enjoyed the filet sandwich and ahi tuna. Thanks again, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Probably not the most amazing first experience I've had at a restaurant. Food was pretty good, the wait service was disappointing. First, we were constantly having to ask for water to be refilled. Then the waitress proceeded to spill a glass of water all over our table and didn't even clean it up. We used our own napkins to clean up the spill ourselves, then when she finally reappeared we had to ask her for new napkins not once but twice which seemed to be a trend with her for the evening. We were constantly asking her for things multiple times. When our food finally came out, the plates were distributed to the wrong people. Overall, for the prices that we paid for the meal, the experience made it less than worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak house so far! I love coming to Ruth Chris, the customer service is excellent. We always have amazing waiters. This last time, we had a young guy who made great conversation and recommendations of wine/prosecco. It has a dark ambiance, like many steakhouses with dark wood walls. I love the classic look. I also prefer to sit at the booths they are comfy. 

We had the calamari to start. I've never had a calamari dish that was sweet but also spicy. The breading did not come off and it was not chewy. 
For my dish I had the filet mignon with shrimp on top. The only complaint I have (which is like nothing) is the temperature of the shrimp, it was not as hot as I would want it, it didn't match the heat of the filet mignon. Any way, I enjoyed this with mash potatoes. My bf had the ribeye with creamed spinach. We shared the sides and they were absolutely perfect as always. We also had the sweet potatoe side-you have to get this! It's amazing. 
I will keep visiting this location, it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and prompt. However the meats, if actually delivered at the requested temperature, were well beyond that over time. This was probably due to the 500 degree plate. Another member of the dining party also noted this disparity. Have eaten at other Ruth's Chris Steak Houses, but this was not the case in those instances."}
{"text":"Came in for a nice quiet and elegant dinner at the bar but got turned off right away. Staff is way too chatting amongst themselves and not the professional bartenders you'd  expect at a place place like this. I left after a drink and went to Capital Grill."}
{"text":"I love that the hot food is on hot plates and salad is on chilled plates.  The salad is very good - good dressing, nice bite size pieces of lettuce, crouton, tomatos, etc.  Their sides are solidly done and their service is superb.  I thought them a bit stuffy before, but upon revisiting - I think I am a fan of their consistent and excellent performance that overrides the annoyance of being forced to valet."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best place for dinner in Vegas. I'm from LA but I go to LV often and I never come without eating here. The restaurant is very nice and when you go in the evening Fri-Sun most of the people are dressed quite nice so it's a bit awkward to go in jeans and a t-shirt if you're not a teenager/kid. Reservations is a must because they get very crowded and no one wants to wait all night to eat. The food is very expensive. I went with 5 other people and the bill was almost $400 but the food is worth it if you're willing to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"My and my boyfriend had dinner here on May 12th. Very nice ambience. I had the filet and it was outstanding. We had a very wonderful waiter. To top off the nite, my boyfriend proposed and I said yes! Waiter heard the news and brought us over two complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is located below the ground level at the south east corner of Adelaide W and University Ave at the Hilton Hotel.

I like Ruth's.  The last time I was at a Ruth's was the newly opened location near the airport exactly 3 months ago to the day we went to visit the Ruth's downtown.  

Last fall Yelp had an Elite event at this particular Ruth's and this was my first return back to this location where I was introduced to the establishment.  During that event we were given the history of Ruth's Chris and Ruth Fertel and as I had mentioned in my review of the airport location, the story is actually pretty fascinating because Ruth did things well ahead of her time.

Back to this location however, the downtown Hilton version of Ruth's is far more of a classic and formal decor as opposed to the location at the airport.  The airport although more contemporary was in my opinion a bit \"nouveau\" while the downtown location just feels more like how a good steak house and restaurant should be.  Even if you take the decor and ambiance out of the picture the food is still the food. 

The check in offers a coat check while we were escorted to our table where our one of our party was already waiting.  The service is very attentive here and the experience seems to be basically that everybody is there to help and please.  I ran into Mike who had been running the show during the Yelp event and he was happy I was back for a visit.  Our waiter, Paul knew the menu inside out and was checking in to make sure everything met our expectations.

We were 4 so we each ordered our own main and had a few a la carte sides to share.  The mushrooms are just so amazing I had to get them again.  I don't think I can come to Ruth's and not get the cremini mushrooms to share.  Our other side we ended up getting the potatoes au gratin which I hadn't tried before.  We also had fries to share as well.

While my wife went with the small filet medallions and shrimp this time I decided I'd go off board and go with the T-Bone instead of my standard which is typically one of the types of ribeye.  

The T-Bone is also a big cut, 22 ounces so basically almost a pound and a half which I ordered medium.  I prefer medium or medium rare mostly.  

There's something about when the plates come out, even if it's not yours and a nearby table's order which is that smell of sizzling butter on those 500 degree hot plates and that sound and smell is just so wow.  

The T-Bone which was just great through and through from start to finish is a very consistent cut.  The round portion while a bit more tender is generally the smaller side of the steak but overall the meat consistency is more solid hearty than the more marbled ribeye.  I liked the T-Bone but overall I think I still prefer the ribeye.

I had accumulated over 160 points which I had to use soon because the loyalty program points are only good for 90 days and most of those points were from the Black Friday special they had basically offering 50% points back on gift card purchases.  

I really like Ruth's but it's a special occasion place for me I'd have to say.  Generally I think it's the type of place I'd go to maybe once or twice a year instead of say going more often.  

While I can't say I go out for a steak dinner often, I would much prefer to go do Ruth's than go to the other chains like the Keg, Canyon Creek, Chop, etc.  

Paul was a great for taking care of us and this place just feels overwhelmingly special overall.  The airport location may be just minutes away from home but I prefer the downtown location because I like the atmosphere better."}
{"text":"Been to Ruth's Chris many many times and this visit was really a disappointment. Our server just wasn't on the ball at all. We still had appetizer and salad plates on the table when the crew brought out our dinners. Additionally, our drinks were empty much of the time. The side dishes were lukewarm at best and the vegetarian \"choice\" is to pick 3 side dishes? Really? That Grilled Portabello mushroom was amazing--even for those who aren't vegetarian and just want to try something a little different.

When I am paying what you pay for a steak at Ruth's Chris, I have high expectations. This visit fell far short. Hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come with Ruth's Chris. :("}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was 4 stars. 

The reason for the 1 star? Our reservation was given to someone else after we went up and had a drink at the bar, even though they said they would come get us for our reservation.  This added a half an hour to our actual reservation time.

We decided to have half off appetizers and happy hour which on our bill didn't give us the discount even though we were pretty much forced to have since our reservation time got pushed out. 

When we got home, the next day we pulled out our leftovers which was about 3/4s our meal because we had filled up on apps and drinks. Come to find out half the leftovers were not ours.. 1 star for that.

Save your money and cook your own prime cut of steak. Atleast the food won't be some ransoms strangers."}
{"text":"The visit started off a bit rocky. It took them a little while to seat us, even though we had made a reservation. The restaurant wasn't even that full. After waiting for about 15 minutes, our table was ready.

Once we sat down, our waiter made up for it. He was courteous and very attentive. we ultimately had a great time and the service was awesome! 

Great food and fantastic service! I would definitely come back to this Ruth's Chris again. 

4 stars just because of the unnecessarily longerwait time"}
{"text":"Annoying that they serve you doubles without telling you. I think that's downright criminal. Drinking and driving??? Everything is delicious. But the chocolate sin cake is ultra underwhelming. Tastes store bought."}
{"text":"I'm updating a five star  review with another.. I really love this place! The service is always on par. The bar, the drinks, the patio its all very comfortable and appealing to the eye. Ruth regularly reinvents itself and the dishes always have a nice southern flair. I hope they bring the french onion soup back but the lobster mac and cheese last night more than made up for it. I've had some amazing steaks here and last nights ribeye was no different. Always perfectly cooked!  Of course the manager made sure we were in good shape and we absolutely were. There is just something about the feel of this place; for me its perfect."}
{"text":"This Ruth Chris steak has a lower standard then anywhere else.  I've had it in the Bay Area and in charlotte  but their steak just doesn't taste super juice rather it tastes somewhat old and on the dry side.  I can buy a Costco steak and cook it at home way better.  Texas Roadhouse can do it cheaper and better at 1/3 of its price"}
{"text":"As I'm sure you've heard, this place is expensive as shit, y'all.

Honestly though, they make you feel like it's worth it, even though it's probably not. The restaurant has great ambiance, so it's generally very mellow and quiet in the dining area. I recommend their bone-in NY Strip, which was one of the best I've ever had. On another occasion I got a ribeye, and instead of \"medium-rare\" I got it practically blue-rare. Parts of it were still good, so I didn't say anything, though I know I could have without issue.

Sides are expensive as well, but are intended to be shared with whoever you are with.

Make a reservation and come early for a drink or two at the bar while they set up your table. Great selection of liquor and not all that pricey, comparatively speaking (I got a cognac and I think it was only about 10 bucks, which is what I'd pay just about anywhere downtown anyway).

If you choose one of their specialty steaks, the waiter/waitress brings out a box of steak knives for you to choose one (there are just two kinds), which is both hilariously superfluous and incredibly fun.

Take a date here for their birthday or valentine's day. I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Ruth's is easily in my top 5 favorite steak houses.  I've been to Ruth's about a dozen times in my life and it is always fantastic.  I know it is a huge chain and we are supposed to hate them but I don't care.  I would eat there every night if I could.  Sadly, neither my wallet or arteries can afford it.

My reservation for 5 was at 8pm last night and the place was pretty dead.  It didn't matter though because we had a super- special VIP private dining room.  I was poking around their website and found that they have several private dining rooms.  So naturally I NEEDED to have one.  I shot the Scottsdale private dining contact (Michelle) an email to inquire about the possibility of getting their \"Ruth's Room\" which is their smallest (5-10 people) room.  She responded and told me it was available and would waive the food and beverage minimums which was nice because I didn't even know there were any.  The only thing they forced upon me was a mandatory 20% tip which I normally do anyway so it wasn't a big deal.  Anyway, I provided her all the details (size of party, time, reason for our visit, etc.) all over email so the whole thing went smoothly.

The private room was excellent and well...private.  We closed the door and curtains as to not bother anybody and had a good ole' time.  It is not that we are rowdy or talking about top secret stuff, it was just nice to not have to worry about other people around.  Not that it mattered because the place wasn't too crowded.  Anyway,  I would highly recommend getting the private room if you have a party of 5 or more. 

The service was good but not the best.  I could tell they all just wanted to go home or upset that we weren't super big spenders.  Plus I had to wait and had to ask for diet coke refills.  No bueno.  I was also pissed that I told them when I made the reservation that 2 friends in our party had just gotten engaged.  I figured they would send us a dessert with a candle in it or something.  Anyway, they didn't send anything or mention anything.  Oh well.  Guess they forgot.

The food:

* Bread the give you to start = they need to upgrade this.  Every other steak place has them beat in this area.

* BBQ Shrimp appetizer = very good

* Tuna appetizer = very good

* Wedge = eh

* Filet = excellent.  My wife and I split the 12oz..  It was cooked perfectly and was more than enough to share.  I forgot to order it with extra butter but I didn't really need it and my wife would have killed me.  The filet is all I have ever gotten at Ruth's.  Next time I'm going for the ribeye to try something different.

* Creamed Spinach = very good.  Ruth's does it the best.

* Lyonnaise Potatoes = This was my first experience with them.  They are just big french fries with some sauteed onions on top.  It was pretty random but pretty good.  Not sure I would order them again though.  I would probably just stick to regular fries.

All-in-all it was a good dinner.  Not perfect but very good.  I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Service was great along with food. This place has a good reputation and I've been here before but it has been awhile. My family enjoyed the food. Steak, hot bread, and the spinach, the dessert was amazing. The servers were great and attentive.  The bill was reasonable and I am sure I will dine here again.  The only thing is that every sip of water I drank someone came around to fill it up again.  Next time, I can tell them to let me eat,  but three different servers came around... so I was caught off guard who just walked up refilled my water again. I will post pics.."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and great feel to the dining room, I had a window seat looking out over the strip.

Excellent food and great service, the lobster bisque was a little bitter for my taste and the corn a little too crunchy but that's probably just my opinion. The bread and butter is some of the best I've had since moving to the states. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the mashed potato was to die for. Very generous portions, I had to leave a lot of food so I had room for desert, not polishing off the mash was a real challenge! Molten chocolate lava cake was stunning!

A little expensive but you get what you pay for! Wanted to score it 4-1/2 but that wasn't an option so scored it 5* as it was closer to 5 than to 4. Would recommend. 

Very happy chappie!!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional...the food tasted really good and it was an amazing experience...I thought the hostess was rather unprofessional for a simple request that she asked of me, but I was not going to allow her ignorance spoil my night..."}
{"text":"We had a group of 20 for dinner...service was excellent & we had a private room.  The table set up was great as we could all converse easily.  I had the filet Oscar style- perfect...sweet potatoes were amazing!!!  Our group was large & our sides were passed around so everyone got a taste of everything...it was all great & I cannot get over how everyone's order was brought out at once, and cooked to perfection. Great job !!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary.  Jordan was our waitress and took great care of us.  I had the petite filet and shrimp and my wife had the Sea Bass.  We were both very happy with our meals.   We opted on the lobster mac and cheese as our side dish and it was out of this world. 

We both would recommend Ruth's Chris to our family and friends."}
{"text":"Simply Perfection! We decided to celebrate our birthdays and anniversary at Ruth Chris in Vegas. Our food was phenomenal, the view was spectacular, and our server Jeff Wise was exceptional. Our desserts were the cherry on top. #bestSteakinVegas"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last night (Thursday). The restaurant is beautiful and we were seated at a table overlooking the Strip. While the food was great, the service was even better. Jonathan and his assistant Dollianne waited on us. We hadn't planned to have dessert, but Dollianne convinced us that we should. We had both the crème brulee and the banana pudding with caramelized bananas on top and ate every bit of both. Both were made in house and are the most memorable part of our meal."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we went! Dinner was excellent, service was impeccable and..... it was private . 
We were not rushed and we could carry on a conversation without strain. 
We have been to a couple of other similar restaurants lately... and Ruth's Chris blows them out of the water!!!! Thanks Ruth!"}
{"text":"Ate here during restaurant week and was looking forward to the seafood trio. They butchered the lobster, scallops and shrimp. They were over cooked and peppered to the point the food was inedible. I would have been better off going to Red Lobster for a fraction of the cost or made it at home. Definitely could have done a much better job. The other person in my party had the rib eye which was flavorless!!! The service was good. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"The servers were courteous and prompt & the meal was nothing short of superb! 
We went during lunch and we were given great attention! The lobster bisque was served warm and the bread was plentiful. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth good; but that fillet!!!! It was extraordinary! So tender and mouth watering that I didn't need a knife. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. Then for the finale...cheesecake w/fresh berries. It stole the show!!"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris is my favorite restaurant!  This is our go-to for special occasions or just for a good meal.  They have the best steaks anywhere. The hubby and I went this past weekend for our anniversary. We ordered cowboy ribeyes, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. We finished our meal off with the chocolate explosion.  This is a seasonal dessert, so if you love molten cakes get it while it's still on the menu.  The food was delicious as always, but what was really nice was how everyone from the hostess, our waitress (who was awesome!), to the manager wished us a happy anniversary.  This was a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here randomly on a Tuesday night with a few friends because we were craving some good steak. After hearing decent reviews, we decided to give this place a try. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted right away by the hostess who also checked in our jackets. It wasn't busy so we were given the option to sit in the lounge or dining area. We opted for the lounge area which I probably wouldn't sit in next time if I ever come back. It was dark and did not have the fine dining experience. I ordered the 3-course meal special for $55 which included an appetizer, entree and dessert. I chose the white bean chirozo bean soup as my appetizer which didn't even taste like soup, it was more of a salted up version of chili that you could just make at home. The filet mignon was cooked medium but I couldn't really tell because it was too dark. It was also over seasoned with salt and soaked in butter. Apparently you could request for no butter but the server never mentioned that. The side orders of mashed potatoes tasted ok but the mushrooms tasted more like it was boiled than sautéed. The mushrooms also lacked flavour. Lastly, the dessert was probably tasted something that came out of a box. It was some sort of Turtles cheesecake that didn't taste anything close to a cheesecake, it was hard, not moist and overly sweet. I was more satisfied with the cookie and ice cream dessert that I had the night before at another restaurant. 

Overall, it was a mediocre experience with the quality of food that was served and was definitely not worth the price. Highly doubt i'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"This review is for a takeout order (hotel room dining at its finest). See their menu and prices at ruths-chris.com. I ordered a ribeye ($43) cooked medium rare with a peppercorn sauce (au poivre) ($4) and served with bread and butter. All this was nicely individually packed but be careful though as I had a bit of leakage. Servers were polite. 

The steak itself was definitely quality meat and my first bite was golden.  The steak was definitely cooked to the right temperature.  This is where the review goes downhill. My second peace I tried with the peppercorn sauce which was not appetizing. As a steakhouse I expected the sauce to complement the meat and not mask it entirely. Finally, with each additional bite the meat tasted saltier until I finally just accepted that they had over salted the meat. A bit too salty to enjoy. In addition, there were a lot of chewy pure fat parts to my steak making it difficult to eat and cut--albeit with a plastic knife."}
{"text":"So I'm in Vegas celebrating my husbands birthday. Made reservations at Ruth Chris Harrah Casino. The customer service was great! No wait when I arrived. Jeff whom was our server offered exceptional customer service! And the food meet Ruth Chris standards. Lovely view and an overall great experience!!! Great Job, RC Crew! Despite it all Vegas still has shown us visitors a good time.. #VegasStrong..."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary there.  They placed decorations at our table and provided us a complimentary desert.  Service was excellent and of course the food was amazing as usual."}

{"text":"It is Restaurant Week in Madison which has happened twice a year for the past several years. I made reservations for dinner with my two adult children to enjoy a nice \"swanky\" dinner together. What a mistake. I have been to this restaurant several times in the past but its been a couple years so thought I would give it a try. I wish I hadn't...

Reservation was for 6:15 - not seated until 6:45.

Waited 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. Waitress Bonnie never brought it - bar manager, Bret Allen, did with apologies for the wait - so they obviously knew there was a problem. Was never offered another beverage during our meal.

Lobster bisque had no lobster in it - my son called it a Lobster Smoothie.

Waited a long time for steaks and again waitress did not bring them. Ice cold. There was a pat of butter on them and the steak was so cold that the butter wasn't melted.

Sent steaks back - they didn't give us freshly prepared steaks but rather heated up the cold ones. Needless to say they were no longer medium rare - way overcooked.

By the time steaks arrived the second time - the sides were there. Luke warm.

Desert - \"Apple Crumb Cheesecake\" was a cupcake type thing with cookie stuck on top for \"crumble.\" It tasted like something bought in a convenience store.

Waitress was so rude to us that I had to ask her to please try and be pleasant.

Spoke to Bret and got a lot of excuses - 
1. 5th night of Restaurant Week. You would think they would have it down by now but instead this was an excuse for poor food and terrible service.
2. Was having problems in the kitchen - something to do with the chef not wanting to be on the broiler - whatever that meant.
3. He said he would take a \"substantial\" amount off our check for our inconvenience. He deducted one meal from the check.

Waitress dropped the check off...never returned. I had to take it up to the hostess station where Bret was waiting. He knew the waitress had not returned to pick up our payment and anticipated I would be displeased.

Several times during the meal, the dining room became very cold and many guests had to put their coats on to get warm

This experience was not unique to us. We heard several table around us all complaining about the slow service and cold food.

I understand Restaurant Week can be busy but this is no excuse. I have enjoyed the same type of meal in the past at this restaurant and never had a problem but clearly Ruth's Chris has management, kitchen and service issues now. Earlier in the week, friends and I had a similar Restaurant Week dinner at competitor Flemings. Excellent experience. Great service. Bigger and tastier steak done to perfection. Food was hot. Cheesecake was a beautiful real New York style desert not a cupcake. With so many wonderful restaurants in Madison, will not waste my time or money at Ruth's Chris again."}
{"text":"Seriously probably one of the best steaks I've had recently!! They are priced high but you are getting quality and the portions are good too. The sweet potato casserole and green beans were great!! I had the filet and my boyfriend had the NY Strip. Both were really good although we both agreed mine was better :-)  The chocolate cake was okay but not as good as some people said it was.  In the future I think I'll come and try an appetizer and skip the dessert!! That being said I will definitely be coming back!! The food and service was above reproach and I was very happy that it lived up to all the raving I had heard about it even though it is a chain restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.

Let me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.

I ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.

We both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.

And what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.

The sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.

As for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.

In summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.

Lastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left."}
{"text":"Don't talk with your mouth full. Once your meal arrives, your guests and yourself will be very quiet. 

One needs to alternate or change up their steakhouses, and Ruth's Chris will always (and has been for a very long time, even before the creation of Yelp) been part of my steak cycle and meal routine."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   In from MI visiting. 8pm Thurs eve place was empty..maybe that was a clue. We were seated in Erin's section. Asked for help w/wine after describing what I like in a red and she tried to steer me toward the $15 glass. I was not above saying that I was not the one paying and didn't want to spend that much on wine.  She literally just stared at me like I grew another head for about 10 seconds and smirked. WHATEVER... Moving on. When the wine came it was chilled. I asked her why, and she said at Ruths Chris they store the wine at 55 degrees...ok all good for storage, but you DO NOT serve the wine at 55, smarty...you serve at 65 degrees.  Again...willing to let pass.  Now, I am just getting back to the Chicken and Turkey world after eating just fish for 3yrs. I ordered an Herb Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast and my mom ordered the BBQ Shrimp. w/ side of Spinach Au Gratin. When food came out I was thrown when the breast of chicken was split w/ a crack down the middle, had 2 bones sticking out of either side and was served on this small plate which made the appearance of the food look like a giant chicken butt...I'm so sorry...it did.  I just looked at my mom and said...I cannot eat this. Since when do chicken breasts have bones, and why isn't that the description on the menu???  Erin was chatting up the table behind us with \"flair\" that she seemed to be missing while serving us.  So, I very nicely asked the gentleman waiter who was walking by for his help, and help he did.  He immediately made me feel comfortable and like a proper customer...whisked up my plate and asked what else he could get me. ( I will not know how she would have handled it, but I doubt very much like he did.)  I ordered the Halibut, and just as he walked away I looked over at my mother and she said...please taste one of my shrimp.  At first I thought she was doing that because it would be a while until l ate, but quickly realized it was because the shrimp were like rubber.  Unfortunately, we had another issue on our hands and although the chicken probably tasted okay and I could not get past the look...now we have over cooked shrimp, at Ruths Chris???  C\"MON!  They made my mom another plate of shrimp and brought me a beautifully done extremely tasty piece of Halibut but guess what, her shrimp was overdone AGAIN!!!  We were both sooo turned off at this point that we just wanted to wrap the Halibut scrap the shrimp and get the heck out of Dodge.  Erin came over and instead of apologizing she told my mom how many BBQ Shrimp dishes she sells nightly and she can't understand it.  Really? Is that how you handle it? Meanwhile, the male waiter (who I wish I could find his card and list his name) brought the manager over.  The manager was deeply apologetic and handled the rest of the evening with the class a restaurant of this caliber should.  They just charged us for the 4 glasses of wine we had ($40)  and we tipped $30 because we have class but I wish it could have gone to the other waiter. WON'T BE BACK...SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HOUSTONS!  BTW...Spinach Au Gratin was really tasty. :)"}
{"text":"Checked out the Ruth's Chris Steak House this year on New Years Eve. Truthfully this is probably not the best night of the year to try places out. Places are busy and its a bit crazy - but we tried their online reservation tool at the last minute and was surprised to be able to get in. Mind you it was later in the night (9:30 I think) but we could still get in.

The place is nice - dress for it. We were greeted at the door and they take your coats. Very short wait to get our table and the atmosphere is wonderful. It should be though - this place is expensive. We knew this going in, but things really added up - and we tip well too, so you should take that into consideration also. 

Our waitress was probably the low point of the night. Very dry personality and no humor would crack her shell. A bit creepy in fact. It was New Years Eve though so maybe she just was burnt out. 

We tried the Crab Cake appetizers. Which were good, but probably won't get again for the cost. I got the Filet and my wife got the Ribeye. Both were cooked fantastic and tasted pretty amazing. I wasn't sure I was a huge fan of their super hot plates. I guess  this is one of their 'things' to keep the meat warm the whole time you are eating. It worked, but it also kept cooking my steak. By the time I got to the last 5 bites - it was now overcooked. I guess I should have ate faster!

We also got the mushrooms and the asparagus for sides. Way more than two people needed to share. I suggest one for a couple. Couldn't help ourselves either and tried a Whisky Bread Pudding for dessert. WOW - really really good. We joked about just going back to get one of those to go from time to time. 

Overall, very very very expensive - but very good too."}
{"text":"Oooh! A fancy steakhouse!....Cynthia likes!! =) Ruth Chris is located on the second level of Harrah's casino level. If you ever get lost or have no idea where to find the elevators that would take you up to Ruth Chris, don't hesitate to ask an employee. Parked his car in valet because it was quick and convenient. 

This place isn't cheap....the two of us ran the bill to about $200.00. But of course, appetizers, soup and salad and wine were ordered as well as our entrees + side dishes.
I ordered the lobster bisque soup while my date ordered a wedge salad.

LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP: My soup was delicious. Although...I think they used a mushroom based broth (if that makes any sense) because I don't like mushrooms and I can recognize that distinct mushroom taste. And it was certainly in my soup. Yucky but it wasn't unbearable.

PETITE FILET MIGNON: The petite is 8 oz. and the larger size is 11 oz. My date and I both ordered the 8 oz. and it was PERFECT sized. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!! The flavoring and seasoning they cooked their steaks with were perfect! Even though I ordered my filet (and any steaks) WELL DONE...it wasn't dried at all. Each bite completely melts in my mouth. You can tell the quality here is ON POINT.

NOTE: Your steaks and any other entrees do not come with any other side dishes. So if you want mashed potatoes or veggies....you gotta order it. Each dish is more than enough to share between two grown adults.

POTATOES AU GRATIN: I'm a sucker for all potatoes. So potatoes with cheese melted on top? UMMM....THIS is like an orgasm in my mouth!!!! Amazing side dish! Must order if you're in love with potatoes like me.

SAUTEED SPINACH WITH GARLIC: Don't be afraid of the garlic...there was only a small hint of the taste. Definitely not strong enough to leave any garlic breath.

Service was great the entire night. They were attentive to our drinks and kept checking back on us throughout the night to see how everything is going. The dessert menu was offered at the end of our meals but we were just too full. He recommended the banana cream pie? Sooo....perhaps you can give that a try?  

Also, this is a fancy restaurant. My date and I were dressed to the nines but I did see a couple people in very casual attire. Come on guys. Please dress the part. Don't come to a $$$$ steakhouse and wear something that belongs to a $ establishment."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was lovely. Our bartender was friendly, kind & competent. Made me a fantastic Martini. Our server Carlos was nice, however he spoke very quietly and was asked numerous times to speak up, he acted like part of their act is to speak gently. I had the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing and almond crusted walleye. I was not impressed with the salad, the dressing and salad were ice cold. The walleye was fantastic. My husband had the fillet, good but not worth the marked up price. My second martini was awful, so apparently there is no consistency, not good. On the menu you are asked to put away your cell phones, which I appreciate. However they do not enforce this request. A table, two over, was clicking away photos, I got shined in the eye twice by the bright cell phone flash. The wait staff never asked them to put their phones away.  Finally as we left there was a women whom was opening the door for customers, appeared to be drunk and was quite obnoxious. We will not return."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a great atmosphere.  I ordered the Petite Fillet Mignon and macaroni and cheese.  Both were delicious.  My buddy got the Ribeye Steak and mashed potatoes, also pretty good.  Yes, it is pricey but it is good if you don't mind dishing out a couple dollars."}
{"text":"This place is very good... Prices were fair given it is a high-end place.  I would say they use way too much butter, but you can request less, etc.  The fish was outstanding as well :)."}
{"text":"Went here in a travelzoo deal while on vacation in Las Vegas. I was skeptical since I thought an upscale restaurant like RC might cut corners a bit on service when using a discount, but they didn't at all. Top notch service, absolutely incredible food, and a great atmosphere. 

One tip, even though other entrées (like seafood) look very enticing, go with the filet. It's what they're known for and unbelievable. One of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Over priced and bad service. Food was too salty...very disappointing :-("}
{"text":"The reason I am only rating this place a three is not because of the food but the service. My boyfriend and I came here for a romantic New Years Eve dinner. This place is definitely romantic and the lighting and environment was perfect. I was super excited because this was our first New Years Eve diner together. We were asked if we wanted to check in our coats and I said \"sure, why not?!\". 

Fast forward to when we got our food. It was good! I had the walleye and my partner in crime ordered his steak. Perfectly seasoned. I ate my whole plate while he couldn't finish his. During our whole time of dining, our waitress did not refill our drinks at all. She walked past us a couple of times and didn't even notice. We finally got a refill when we were about to leave which was pointless. 

We proceeded to go get our coats. My boyfriend hands the lady our coat tag. She comes back with one coat. Hm?! Well, where is mine?! Oh. It got lost. I spent 15 min with one of their employees trying to find my coat in a closet that didn't even have a light bulb. The lady had to hold a tiny flashlight so she can dig and find my coat. The whole entire time she kept apologizing which was nice, but at the 5 min mark I was starting to get irritated. How can you lose a coat?! It took three people to find my coat and by the 15 minute mark, I was pissed! One of the employees finally found my it. I grabbed my coat from him, found my boyfriend in the lobby and said \"LET'S GO!\"

I left there with such a bad feeling. Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steak House is definitely one of those restaurants for special occasions or if someone else is paying the bill :p  I came here (alone) as I was in a completely different state for work.  The hostess and servers were all very friendly and provided prompt service with a smile.  The server took her time to explain any specials and address any questions I had.  

I ordered the rib eye and the scalloped potatoes.  I kid you not but the steak was the most delicious I've ever had!  It melted in my mouth and was probably better than the reserve meats I've tried at other places.  The scalloped potatoes were wonderfully cheesy and had a great texture (not to mention it came in a huge serving).  I also had the citrus mojito to go with dinner (which was OK but nothing extra special).  

Anyways, this place is all the hype says it is- should definitely try when not on a budget!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with anything at Ruth Chris. On our latest visit I had the Rib Eye (or at least half the Rib Eye as my DH ate at least half) and my husband had the pound of crap legs. Everything was so good, the steaks are indescribably delicious; they just melt in your mouth. Excellent wedge salad, which is big enough to split. I'm not a lover of seafood but even I though the crab legs were excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I must say than BOTH experiences were incredible. The food is unreal. Top quality no question!! Mouth watering just thinking about it. The drinks are made to perfection. Any time I would be thinking about ordering something, the waiter would give his opinions on what's good and what's not. He was honest with everything.  The server was super friendly. 
So the second time I went was for my Anniversary and they decorated our table with confetti. It was really nice. We got free dessert as well. I'm super happy with this place and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The good-
+The bread and butter they give is DELICOUS.  The bread is super crusty on the outside and moist and warm on the inside.  The butter is whipped and salted.
+The table was decorated for our anniversary with colorful heart confetti and we were brought a delicious complementary dessert of chocolate mousse in a chocolate cup and creme brulee.
+The value of the complete meal- $39.95 for a 6oz filet and shrimp with soup or salad, one side dish and dessert.
+The Lyonnaise potatoes

The bad (or okay really...)-
*The parking situation- you either have to do the $3 valet parking or explain to the valet that you want to self park.
*The service.  She was nice just not great.
*The broccoli au grautin which came highly recommend by the waitress
*The garlic mashed potatoes

The ugly-
-The hollandaise sauce that came with the asparagus was DISGUSTING, HORRIBLE, YUCKY, NASTY, GROSS stuff
-The filet was ordered medium came out well done.  No pink anywhere on it."}
{"text":"Love it! The seabass, sweet potato casserole and asparagus  delicious! The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant until my husband suggested we take our mom's out to dinner here for Mother's Day.  

We rolled up to valet service which was really nice.  We had a 7pm reservation and were seated immediately.  Our party of 4, then met our server Marvin, who was fabulous in every way.  He was on point with all our questions, he was personable, charming and very attentive without being annoying.  

We started with apps - BBQ shrimp, calamari and crab cakes.  The portions were bigger than we expected and everyone enjoyed everything.  The calamari app was the biggest and we had to have the rest boxed up because we couldn't finish it.

Next came salad...tomato mozzarella, two iceburg wedges with bacon and blue cheese crumbles and a steak house salad. I had asked originally to have the dressing for the steak house salad on the side, but the salad arrived with dressing on it and sadly it was overdressed.  We told Marvin and he immediately whisked it away and came back with an undressed salad with dressing on the side. All the salads were fresh and crisp and delicious.  

Then our main course. One ribeye with baked potato, one ribeye with lobster tail and shoestring fries, one NY strip with tempura onion rings and one order of lamb chops with sauteed mushrooms. When all the sizzling plates arrived, our mouths were watering.  Everything was hot, cooked exactly as requested, well seasoned and perfect.  Some sides were family size, and they weren't kidding. The shoestring fries were huge and scrumptious...just the right amount of crispiness.  We had to box up a few things because there was just no way we could eat everything AND still have dessert.  

Oh dessert...Crème Brûlée, cheesecake and two chocolate avalanches of ganache goodness with ice cream on top. To.Die.For.  Everything was exquisite and just so flavorful.  

But besides the food, and the amazing service (because did I mention Marvin was outstanding?), what we really enjoyed was that everything was so wonderfully spaced out.  We didn't feel rushed. One course wasn't sent out until the course before was completely done. Everything from our arrival to the check was done purposefully to make the entire dinner an experience.  Marvin even had the valet pull our car around before we left so it would be there when we exited.  There's something to be said about a place that cares about every little detail, down to removing any crumbs from the table between courses and not being intrusive during the meal.  

This was more than just a dinner, it's something we will remember for a long time. We are already trying to figure out when we can go back because this is an experience you should have more than one time.  Oh Ruth Chris, you got it right!"}
{"text":"Corn fed beef. Smothered in butter. The porter house is delicious. And the service and atmosphere are great. If u want to spend this kind of money for steak there are many better options. Such as barbarians."}
{"text":"Queens Feast at Ruth's Chris was perfect! Each course was perfect and timed well! Our back server was on top of refills. Our server was a bit strange, she kept touching her nose which was a bit unsanitary. What really impressed me was when I asked about nuts being in the dessert, because of my allergy, and they said yes even though it wasn't written in the menu. They switched out my dessert and gave us two glasses of champagne because of the trouble. They really went a step above and we appreciated that."}
{"text":"I came here because Morton's was closed during a weekday. I had always wanted to stop in because I had heard good things. Was not impressed, the only thing that help me manage to finish my food was the 4 glasses of Johnny Walker Blue I had. Weird layout for what should be a fancy place."}
{"text":"Outstanding location with Law Vegas strip views. Very comfortable seating and you're not on top of your neighbor. Good upscale atmosphere. Ask to be seated in Johnny's area. Amazing food and service. The petit filet is significant in size and the spicy shrimp app is very good. Awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"Horrible, the steaks were dry and not tender, and no flavor. We ordered medium.  The asparagus was wrinkled and stringy.  Not going back, not worth the money"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Ruth's Chris and having heard many positive stories from friemds that I was full of anticipatory anxiety as a child on Christmas Eve. But I couldn't look at name tags or peek between wrapping paper!

Anyway, there were 14 of us in town for an event, and Ruth's Chris was offering a 3-course prix fixe menu for $40 or $50 depending on your entree. The complete meal offered at $39.95 includes a choice of Steak House Salad, Caesar Salad or Louisiana Seafood Gumbo, followed by a choice of Ruth's Chris signature eight-ounce Petite Filet, Stuffed Chicken Breast, Barbecued Shrimp, or the Chef's Fresh Island Fish selection.

Diners may upgrade their meal to the $49.95 entrÈe option to select from the 11-ounce Filet with Grilled Shrimp, Veal Chop with Hot and Sweet Peppers, 16-ounce Ribeye Steak, or Lobster tail with blackening spice, lemon and drizzled butter 

I, in a slight prescription drug induced fog, thought I had ordered the ribeye just like my 2 co-workers sitting across from me had. Unfortunately I received (and vaguely recall hearing myself say) the filet. My choice of appetizer and side dish was the house salad with a zesty French dressing and the garlic mashed pots.

The salad was good with a flavorful and slightly tangy. The garlic mashed was only so-so at best. They tasted a bit off and were somewhat crusty as though they had been under a heat lamp for a while. Next time, I get the mushrooms like my mother taught me! Now the steak... aside from being slightly undercooked and much closer to rare than medium rare, the flavor was AWESOME. Without a doubt the best piece of meat I've ever eaten! 

Unfortunately after the entree is where this experience took a turn for the worse... We all had finished and were sitting there waiting for the plates to be cleared, water to be refilled, dessert to be brought... aaaaannnnnndddddd.... nothing. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Finally one of our group had to go up to the maitre d' and complain about the lack of service.

As it turned out, or so we were told, another large group being handled by our waitress decided to ask for seperate checks once the bill arrived and then were having credit card issues on top of that, tying her up trying to get them out the door. Anyway, moving on...

The dessert course came and was a pairing of strawberries in a vanilla creme along with a chocolate mousse with whipped cream in a fluted cup made of (dark?) chocolate. Absolutely delicious!!

All in all, the experience was more positive than negative. Aside from the fact that management should've (and according to the waitress was requested by her to) handled the other difficult table, I was thoroughly impressed. Bon appetit!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get together and enjoy. Seemed to be a casual place. Great spot to view the strip. The ambience is nice. Service is great. The food was excellent.  It will put a dent in your wallet, but really... think about it you probably would have lost it on the tables... lol Bon appetite!  I'd come back."}
{"text":"The service and the food was outstanding. Our waitress was cordial and attentive. The food presentation was excellent.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely.  I can't wait to head back to Vegas & go back to Harrah's Ruth's Chris...

{"text":"My first visit to Ruth's Chris..during Charlotte Restaurant Week. I figured no better time to patronize the establishment than when they have offers on their best dishes. The wait was longer than expected, but the hostess and managers kept coming by to apologize for the delay. Everyone there was very friendly. Even though we had our assigned waitress, others would come by and bring water or bring more bread. In regards to the food. I had a ribeye. Cooked to my liking medium rare..the steak itself tasted like is was seasoned with \"montreal steak seasoning\"...while the ribeye is my favorite cut, I've had a better tasting elsewhere. My side was the creamed spinach, it was nice and creamy with a buttery taste. The wedge salad was also good, could've used a bit more dressing (it's more of a drizzle) and more bacon. I added the sweet potato casserole as an extra side since I heard so much about it...by far it was the most delicious and the thing that I would give 5 stars. I'm big on steals so it was great to get out and experience a new place, I would be back, if for nothing else but the sides."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is fantastic.  The steak, the appetizers, the sides...all fantastic.  But the server & the wine?!?  AMAZING.  And they went hand in hand.  Our server made a few vino suggestions to match our meal but strongly pointed us in the direction of a cab from Cali called Justin.  I think this is what heaven may taste like.

I was not so excited about dinner here (chained out steak houses - boo), but I was impressed.  The setting was intimate and quiet without being pretentious and the food, drink and service were all tops."}
{"text":"Haven't been since I was too young to appreciate a good Steak house so I was excited.
My disappointment was great once our food started to arrive.
The Crab bisque was no bisque.
Creamed corn was so so and the waitress couldn't tell us what was in it. \"I'll have to ask\" was the last we ever heard about it.
My filet was fine but nothing I would expect from a fine dining steak house.
Service seemed to have the same \"Lack luster \" sheen on it. Empty glasses and no bread was just par for tonight's course.
The Classic dinner special was a great price if the food had stood up.
We tried to pull something positive from our experience and between 4 of us came up with shoulder shrugs."}
{"text":"Only because Ive been to Ruths Chris in DC.. and its the bomb.. I cant go higher than a 3 on this one.. they do things completely different.. and I didnt expect that.. and the steak wasnt impeccable.. and sorry, it should be. The location isnt grand.. and its easy to miss.. in my opinion.. Steaks are sent out still cooking on hot plates and the seemingly trite bellboy tells you to cover your top so quickly that you dont really know what he truly said so you watch the others at the table who have deciphered bits and pieces of the quick statement.. and follow their lead.. at any rate.. my filet was good, not great. My dates was a bit over the medium scale of cooked.. the lyonnaise potatoes..good.. The salads, good.. My wine.. well, Mendocino Fog from my home.. great! It was my dates birthday, they got that right on.. so again, to compare to other steakhouses.. its not a 5. They didnt have the kobe steak as other Ruths Chris's do.. but our waiter, Larry was great.. and as I said so was the wine, as was the chocolate cake.."}
{"text":"You always know what you're going to get at Ruth's Chris.....really good quality food, excellent professional service, and a big bill. Unless of course you go for their special $15 lunch which IS a good value (see my tip).

Work only a block away, so this is a \"go to\" lunch spot for and my workmates. Their burgers are GREAT! But really so is most everything on the menu. Today I had the Broiled Chicken breast with Mozzerella on a baguette. Opted for their French Onion soup for my \"side.\" REALLY delicious food as always.

Dinner however will set you back QUITE a bit more.......just be prepared to pay high prices for that high quality food, especially their steaks. Their 8oz Lunch Fillet was $36! That's why their $15 lunch is such a bargain. Try their steak sandwich for lunch....a STEAL at $15."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed in the food or the service. The seared ahi tuna is perfection with the mustardy sauce. Red meat is heavenly"}
{"text":"Bar area is small compared to some of the other Ruth's I've been in. Actually came here during restaurant week. I was of course extremely busy. Ordered from the restaurant week menu as well as the standard menu. Everything came out top notch which I wasn't expecting with the large crowd. The only downside was the lack of waiters available. We had a bit of a wait to place our order, but on restaurant week it seemed like they had every table full."}
{"text":"Any place with it's own elevator should definitely be visited by all! I mean who doesn't want to take a private elevator down to the restaurant?

We came here for Winterlicious 15 and I'm so very glad we did! I enjoyed this place very much and the flavours and smells will make your tastebuds dance for joy.

The caesar salad was very flavourful for a caesar salad. Now, the entree dishes come out sizzling and trust me this is not just a form of expression. They legit sizzle at your table. So don't touch the plate! Sadly, I accidentally did later on in the dinner and boy did I regret that! I ordered the stuffed chicken breast and it was pretty good! I would prefer more stuffing of the herb garlic cream cheese. My fiancee had the Filet and it was mouth watering delicious! So tender and it just melted in your mouth. 

The desert was very good. I kept hearing about the chocolate sin cake, so I ordered that! However, it was way to chocolatey (is that even a word?) Thankfully, our waiter Glenn was amazing and allowed me to switch out to the cheesecake. So yummy! 

Final verdict? Love this place! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I've given this location because it's not corporately unwed, and my experience with Ruth Chris Steakhouse is the privately owned ones skimp too much. 
They didn't have everything because they were still waiting for approval. 
I had crab legs and bone in filet medium rare. 
The crab kegs were soft and not too tasty. I didn't enjoy them at all. 
The filet came out well done at the first cuts. When I told them I only eat it medium rare, they told me to cut close to the bone, it should be medium rare there. What?? So I throw away 75% of the $67 steak to get what I want. They finally took it, but then brought back a steak rare. Since I don't live here, I couldn't get it to go to cook more at home. They then told me to jet it rest longer so it would cook more. Really?!?
It was tender, but little flavor. 
The chopped salad was as amazing as ever, but the bakes potato was cold with no little sides for such a big potato. 
Someone had the $90 lobster. It was tough, and not worth $90. 
I highly recommend Ruth Chris, just not the one in harrahs."}
{"text":"We went to Ruth's Chris at the South Park location on a Sunday evening and let's just say the crowd was \"different\". The service was great and our server did a great job, however the food was mediocre at best. The bread was hard and crispy, the Caesar salad had so much dressing that it was overwhelming with a more than usual super strong anchovie taste, the petite filet was actually very good and well prepared, however my husband did not enjoy his ribeye at all and kept comparing it to Del Frisco's across the street. The garlic mashed potatoes were very creamy and rich tasting, but we did not like the green beans at all. Overall this was a very mediocre dinning experience with an unusual crowd and not a place we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Hooray for my birthday always being during restaurant week! 9:15 reservations, seated almost immediately. Started with the Cesar salad. Nice portion size. Holy crouton goodness! They were my favorite part of the salad. So yum. Decided to do the $10 upgrade to the kings feast. I mean $10 for 5 extra ounces of filet mignon...its really a no brainer. Medium rare please and green beans,mashed potatoes and onion rings as sides. Steak comes out sizzling, cooked perfectly to my liking(kinda on the rarer side) and at least 2 inches thick. Birthday steak wish granted. Sides were good as well. The green beans really stood out. Since it was a special occasion our waitress had 2 complementary glasses of wine delivered to the table. No idea what wine it was but it was amazing. Seriously, i could have easily downed a bottle or two of it (Im trying to keep it classy, i promise). 
Onto dessert. To me it usually feels like dessert is kinda an afterthought at most restaurants. I was very impressed with the 3 dessert sampler they offered. It featured a slice of chocolate espresso cake, a small cheesecake and a raspberry sorbet. Again, awesome and exceeded my expectations. 
I will definitely be back as i have dreams to one day order the \"porterhouse for two\" for one."}
{"text":"Food was amazing per usual! The gentleman who was running food and cleaning tables was amazing, although our server was OK at best. Took over two hours to have dinner with no drinks."}
{"text":"4 stars for the amazingly soft and tender steak! Everything else weren't too great but the steaks at Ruth's Chris are hands down my favourite for now. Had a steak from here for the first time and now I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"We were highly disappointed in the service. Food was amazing as usual but the service really ruined the entire experience. We go to Ruth's Chris often and this was the only time we've had bad service, they usually go above and beyond. Seems they were short staffed or maybe have too many tables per section."}
{"text":"I had the New York strip, so juicy and tender cooked to my request.  Best steak every had. Nice ambiance and quick Service."}
{"text":"Oftentimes this is where my family chooses to go to celebrate birthdays or other special occasions, and I'm always happy to eat here! The wine list is great, and I always end up getting the chicken breast, which is stuffed with a ricotta type cheese (AMAZING). I'm getting hungry just writing this. The sides are large enough to share, so make sure you don't go crazy ordering lots for yourself. The hashbrowns are crispy and so good."}
{"text":"The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return."}
{"text":"My son took me out for a birthday dinner on April 1, and surprised me with a Ruth's Chris night out.  This is a relatively new restaurant, and it did not disappoint. The two level restaurant was both large and intimate, with the smaller dining areas away from the bar. Fun color combos, and spotlessly clean, this is a place to go to relax.

We had what seemed like a zillion employees waiting on us.  As a business owner, I wondered how they were able to find such quality people?  Our steaks were cooked great, and tasted even better.  They brought us a complimentary dessert which was wonderful, and kept our wine glasses full all evening.

I really don't care what everyone else thinks, but for my money, this is the best Ruth's Chris Steak house in the USA and Mexico, and the best chain steak restaurants in the nation.  Well done, Ruth would have been proud of this operation."}
{"text":"This happy hour just can't be beat!  The steak sandwich and the burger are ridiculously good- the quality is awesome. I do wish they would expand the happy hour wine list a bit, but the cocktail selection is really nice if you prefer that.  Sit on the patio if you can!"}
{"text":"Splurged and went here for my husband's birthday last week and have to say, it was disappointing and we won't be back.  Service was wonderful, but the food was subpar at best.  He got a Ribeye which was good, but not the best he has had.  I got the one and only fish entree and it was mediocre.  I've had better at Outback!   The appetizer was nice, but the sides were awful.  Gross cheese covered crunchy potatoes that we left behind, and very plain grilled asparagus.  Not seasoned and there were maybe ten pieces.  Probably two dollars each!  They were nice and brought a small dessert for his birthday, but then offered a complementary picture which never happened because they never came.  The meal was $200 and we were disappointed, need I say more?"}
{"text":"I really like Ruth's Chris. I've been to a few different locations, and I've always been impressed with the food & service. This Scottsdale location is no exception.

(+) One of the finest Filet Mignon steaks you're going to eat, brought out to you sizzling in butter. *drool*
(+) Order the Barbecue Shrimp appetizer. Trust me. Just order it.
(+) Order the Stuffed Mushroom appetizer too. What, you'll have no room for steak? Dude, make room! Splurge!
(+) Attentive, professional staff. You won't want for anything. They'll serve and clear on the proper side of the table. They'll place your dessert spoon horizontal to you. You know, all the fancy details.
(+) Yes, that table bread is delicious, and you'll need it to sop up the sauce that the Barbecue Shrimp came in. ...You did order it, right?
(+) Great wine selection. And they're honest with their recommendations too (unlike some restaurants that will say anything about a bottle of wine if they think it'll help sell it).
(+) If you come here on your birthday, they'll sprinkle confetti all over their fancy white table cloth...just for you. Feel special.
(+) No room for dessert? Yeah, you're gonna have to order the Creme Brulee anyway. Really.
(-) Super spendy (...for mortals like me anyway). Makes this a special occasion sort of place; but you'll be well satisfied when you do go."}
{"text":"The online happy hour promotion indicated a $7.99 specials, but the menu stated $11.  The decor and venue are top quality and relaxing, we settled down and ordered prime sliders and steak sandwich.  

My friend devoured her sliders as if she had not eaten in a week (I happen to know she went out to lunch that day, so hunger was not the reason).  The sizzling steak smell wafts through the restaurant and her inner carnivore was triggered.  My steak sandwich was divine.  They take the ends of the filet mignon and cut into big chunks.  Cooked perfectly, extremely tender, and full of Ruth Chris flavor.  

Our waiter, Jonathan, was very attentive and we did not have to ask for anything.  Water, bread and appropriate attention was provided for our 3 hour chat-fest.  We've decided this is currently our favorite spot in LV, though our research continues.  

A visit by the manager with personal invitation to return was our final hoorah for this restaurant and location.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were here with other couples and enjoyed the food and services overall. My hubby got the tomahawk, and I ordered the regular ribeye. They both were Delicious! We all shared the sides, such as the calamari, grilled asparagus, mashed potatoes, and Caesar salad. Each were good to the taste. We will definitely be back when in the area.

Tip to the Men - NO TANK TOPS ALLOWED so wear a shirt."}
{"text":"Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow. 
Girls weekend in Calgary, and this is where we ended up. Due to a friend having a g/c that may never get used, why not treat ourselves?
The three of us, while looking rather casual, made a reservation online and walked over to Ruth's Chris at the Calgary Tower. We were out for drinks, and decided that it was a nice enough evening in February that we would walk. 
We were greeted warmly, and escorted to our cozy booth. 
Our server, Adam, was beyond pleasant, and joked with us. Every time he came to our table I would say \"Hey Adam, nice to see you again! Thanks for coming back\". He always had something witty to say and kept us in high spirits. 
Drinks: Christine and I had Caesars and oh boy were they awesome. Tall glasses, super smooth taste, just the right amount of kick. Carley had a fizzy pink girlie drink and said it was awesome.
Appies: Decided not to get appies, but we got free cheese bread, so that's good enough for me!
Entree: Each of us had a steak (because, duh.... why wouldn't you). Two of us had Canadian beef, while one had American, just to try it. Carley and I got ours \"Oscar'd\" with crab, asparagus and a cream sauce. Christine had hers plain, or else she would have had to use her epi-pen. We told Adam about it and the kitchen was accommodating with her seafood allergies. For sides we had the brussel sprouts and potatoes au gratin to share. 
The steaks were cooked absolutely perfectly and literally melted in your mouth. The brussel sprouts were to die for, and potatoes were on point. 
Dessert: We had to pass, because wow. We were so stuffed. 

Thanks Ruth's Chris for giving us one heck of a dining experience. Thanks Adam for being such a fun server (we hope we made your night too). Loved it!"}
{"text":"I always make of point of eating in this place!
The drinks were great and service was awesome. The steak were good and soaked in butter.
Absolutely GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing. We were seated on time, and have been waiting 15 minutes for our server to take our drink order. Still waiting right now. 

We've watched the server deliver at least two tables before taking our fm drink order.



5 minutes later. The server just came by, took our drink order and I said we're ready to order food..... So she walks away and says she'll be back without taking our order. I'll never take clients here again.

28 minutes after seating the server finally comes to take our order. See if she gets it right."}
{"text":"So good!! Had steak, mashed potatoes, lobster tails, and mushrooms. Expensive but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Damn, they make a mean steak.

My petite filet was tasty goodness. Who can hate it when your steak comes on a plate still sizzling with butter??? My size 0 bff KILLED her ribeye - it was that good."}
{"text":"Wow this place is expensive.  Not sure if its worth it but the quality is definitely a step up from the Keg.  $50 for a steak? Wow! Ribeye medium rare was amazing.

That's all I had because I'm being budget conscious....more trips to Dollarama lol"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, comfortable  restaurant. The service was first class, and the food as amazing!  The filets were perfect and the side dishes, sweet potato casserole, garlic mashed, and creamed  spinach , were great and shareable. This is certainly one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep the food section brief here: I got the Ribeye Medium-Rare, outstanding; and my girlfriend got the Filet Oscar Style Medium-Rare, completely blown away!

This is Ruth's Chris, if you want to know more about the food, there are plenty of other reviews here that go into great detail.

Instead, this review is all about the amazing service experience we received from our server Marvin. We are a young couple and based on some of the reviews in the past, some of the staff tend to pay more attention to the older, higher-spending tables. I can assure you that in my handful of visits to this location we received above-the-bar service, with no indication that the tables around us we're being given preferential treatment. When we were first seated Marvin promptly engaged us in conversation and asked what we were doing in uptown for the night. He showed us the restaurant week menu and explained the process.

I was extremely surprised at Marvin's knowledge of wines. I noticed that my favourite bottle of Shiraz was not on the menu, not surprised given that it is made by a small winery in Australia. Not only was Marvin familiar with the bottle and the winery, he knew that they just got a bottle in the other day and it was not added to the menu yet. He even sold it to us by the glass!

Throughout the night Marvin came in and out, making sure everything was just perfect. I can't really describe it, but every time he came to the table was unique, not just the cookie-cutter \"Everything OK?\"

My only regret was that I was not able to see Tim (manager) again, he came by our table twice to make sure our dining experience was exceptional. I did not see him before we left but if you are reading this Tim, I want you to know that we came to the restaurant for the Food, but we will be back because of the amazing experience that Marvin and your staff meticulously created for us!"}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the old location on Paradise Rd. They took so many good items off of the menu- no more french onion soup, peas au gratin, macaroni, or green beans. The staff is comparable to one you'd find at Applebee's, the decor is boring, my menu had water and soda stains all over it, I felt like I was at an overrated and overpriced Outback. Not to mention the dumpy casino that it's in. I will never go back here again and this used to be my favorite place!  
The one star is for their Expresso Martini."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. One of the best meals I've ever had! Service was excellent as well- our server Jennifer was just great. I had the filet and it was definitely the best steak I've ever had. The sides were good but nowhere near as good as the steak. We had the baked potato and green beans (I'd probably pass on the green beans next time). It was my birthday and they brought out a generous slice of cake with a candle. Ps the plates really are 500 degrees, be careful!"}
{"text":"i would not give this place a 5 star just because the service was good, but not up to 5 star status, more keg like service, its ok but....the food was great the filet was cooked to order, the steakfries and the salads were good, the best part was  chocolate sweet bread.....try it but its kinda pricey $100 per person if you want a full meal......"}
{"text":"Great as always.. one of my favorite steak house in town.. service was fast and friendly. Cream brûlée and chocolate cake for dessert was delicious! We'll back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at a Ruths Chris Steakhouse and I must say I was completely bowled over by the excellent experience! I flew 15,000 kilometres to Vegas for SEMA week and was recommended by friends to try this steakhouse. Among the different steaks I've had that week in different, the Cowboy Rib-Eye was hands-down the best! The sizzling steak butter was the best match to the flavourful meat. The lobster bisque was exceptional and so was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Real classic dishes and served perfectly! 

But for me the most memorable experience was with my server Joe Veniegas! He was alert, hospitable, honest and charming. I've observed him on the other tables and you could witness the exceptional service provided by Joe. I could not ask for more. If you're ever in Vegas for Ruths Chris, ask for the guy! All my friends will from now on. 

Not only will I return, I will tell all my friends about it :)"}
{"text":"We got the ribeye and the lamb chops. For the price disappointing. Didn't taste nearly as good as the aged steak we had at Pittsburgh Ruths Chris.  Could have gone to a Texas Roadhouse steakhouse and had comparable dinner for way less"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this delicious steak house as a celebration for my University Graduation. I was truly impressed by Ruth's Chris! Even entering the restaurant was unique: you take an elevator down a level, only to fimd the entirety of the sophisticated restaurant all beneath the surface. Upon entering, there is a hostess waiting for you, who politely takes you to a table. There's a variety of seating arrangements, and everything is dimly lit.
I got a booth seat which was nice, and our waiter, Malcolm, was exceptional from the start! He used our names while telling us about the menu, was attentive to our table (without being annoying), and was an overall pleasure....amazing service! 
My boyfriend and I went with the porterhouse (meant for 2 ppl) as well as a side of lobster Mac and cheese. A huge tray of Mac and cheese was placed on our table (as it's intended to share family style) and the steak came on a sizzling hot plate! The steak was pre-divided into several sections, and our waiter kindly placed a piece of each cut of steak on our butter sizzling plates.
Words cannot describe the flavour amazement of their steak.....perfectly tender, perfectly flavoured, nothing to complain about. The Mac and cheese was amazing too, definitely no shortage of cheese!
I fwlt so bad not being able to finish our steak and enjoy all of it at its finest, freshest moment, but our waiter was more than happy to pack up the leftovers for us. 
This place will certainly dent your credit card bill....but if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion and be a little spoiled, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable steaks, sides, and service!  Pricey but well worth it.  We will go back as often as possible!!"}
{"text":"I read Mona's review from the Yelp app on my iPhone while lounging by the pool in Scottsdale on Sunday and our group of 6 booked a reservation for that night. Mona hit it spot on. This place has it together; service and food. I recommend the Sweet Potato casserole with pecan crust for a side. Everything was perfect, our waiter was on the dorky side, but, the fireworks we watched out the window from somewhere nearby kinda sealed the deal as the best dinner I've had in the last year"}
{"text":"It's usually so good here. But tonight the gentleman who served us was very obviously in a hurry to get us out. He even asked if we were ready to give him our payment before clearing the table. Very unprofessional. Very pushy. Almost came across as rude. I'm not sure if this is a location I'm willing to return to. It's unfortunate as this used to be a great place to eat for special events. Maybe I'll find a new place for these events. Thanks anyway Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"Was there for Turkey day. The service was impeccable the sea bass fantastic. ...the scallops not so much.. if u go get the lobster tail filet surf and turf...don't order the scallops....that item should be taken off the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  In the reservation on OpenTable, I requested a booth with a view and the request was met spectacularly! Our server seemed rushed (and was therefore a bit curt) at the beginning but after drinks were ordered (and perhaps some of his other tables left or something) he seemed to relax and was more polite.  My boyfriend had the T-bone and I had the sea bass special; we had lyonnaise potatoes and creamed spinach as our sides.  It was all delicious and came out hot.  My boyfriend's steak was cooked medium well rather than medium but we didn't make a fuss because with both the filet and the strip to consider T-bones can be challenging (Although for the price it should be perfect).  For our anniversary, they brought us a complimentary piece of decadent chocolate fudge cake that was more than enough to share.  We had a groupon and also used our total rewards card because you get reduced prices and points if you use that.  Due to the groupon, and 18% gratuity is added before you pay.  Overall it was a lovely dinner with good food.  If not for the few minor complaints, it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"10 of us went to dinner on a Monday night for a special birthday. The food was good but our 2 waiters seemed to have forgotten us. After we ate the group came and cleaned up our plates and left us sitting there for half an hour. They never came over and asked if we'd like to look at the desert menu, fill our drinks, etc.  The manager walked by and never even said hello. We finally flagged him down and asked to see our waiter. 10 minutes later the waiter brought out a birthday dessert with a candle. He set it down and was going to walk away and then on second thought asked if we'd like dessert menus. I said no thank you, I'd like the bill. The person next to me leaned over to me and said \"I would have liked a dessert menu a half hour ago\". It was the same thing I was thinking. I will not go back to this Ruth
Chris's. Very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"A RC wedged into a corporate park with great veiws of the parking deck. Below average service and food. The strip steak was fatty and seemed to be boiled in butter. Yuck. The wine was red and delish."}
{"text":"Our server So Yon was amazing last night!! She made us feel like family!! Amazing person with a great personality. The food was amazing but she made our dinner more special! Hope to see her next time!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris never lets me down. The food is amazing and the service is exceptional. We have been taking my young son there since he was a toddler and they are always very welcome and accommodating to him. For every special occasion we choose Ruth's Chris for dinner. One year we actually received a flower in a vase on our doorstep for our anniversary with a girt card from Ruth's Chris!! It was amazing!"}
{"text":"To quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at Ruth Chris's: Thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! If we had paid full price, my husband and I would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  Now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. Sadly, neither was true at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

My husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. While he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just OK. Definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  I had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. Was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? Heck no! I appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  I don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but I don't like them overly moist. McCormick and Schmick's are way too dry, but Ruth Chris's are way too moist. Blah. Also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  I can't wait to visit my parents in Maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  Our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  The $1 instant potatoes we buy at Fry's are better and have more flavor.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is 10x better than what I ate at Ruth Chris's.

Our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. The atmosphere was just OK.  We had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...WTF? And for an \"upscale\" restaurant, I was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! Yuck.

My husband and I said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  High prices do not equal good food."}
{"text":"Above average steak house.  Both this one and the one on Camelback.  Enjoyed the steak.  Not my favorite in Phoenix, but I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Ruth's chris is like a woman I know, and you know her too, you know... That chick who's got a reputation... Except instead of getting drunk and flashing you at the bar, Ruth's chris' reputation is outstanding service, and the most delicious aged steaks that money can buy. (and believe you me, you'll need to bring some money with you) however, my first experience with this wonderful chain of steak houses was in Baltimore, and after that wonderful experience, the las Vegas cousin didn't quite blow my mind.  Yes, the steak and sides were equally amazing.  Yet the restaurant layout was a wee bit cramped, and the service seemed more Applebees-esque than what you'd expect from a restaurant with such high esteem.  
And for the 121.00 dollars I spent on dinner, you think they'd be able to afford to, perhaps, turn on a light or two, it was the DARKEST restaurant I've ever dined in.  
That being said, I give them four stars, which for a regular establishment, is pretty solid, but for a 'five star' restaurant... It's no bueno.
My recommendation, have at least two
Hours to kill, and bring small lantern so you can find your silverware. ;-)
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice place.. Good steak , worth a repeat......"}
{"text":"very disappointed, don't know what all the hype is about. steak was not so great & fries were still raw & cold. the prices on the online menu are cheaper than the menu at the restaurant. steak was advertised almost $20 cheaper online & we were told that's the corporation price, not the franchise price.  I would not have mind the price difference if the food was great....very disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to RC in Harrahs last night with a wedding party of 8. Had looked at the menu online before going only to find that they had NONE of the specials advertised online available! None, zip, zilch! 
Then after several of the guests ordered the porterhouse for two ($105) the server knocks over a guests glass of wine and spills it into the porterhouse of another guest. I find out after the dinner that the kitchen only re-plated the meat leaving it wine soaked. I was shocked to see this level of really awful service at a Ruth Chris and hope it is not just what they have come to. I've eaten at RC in many cities around the US and have always thought they had the best steak around but I've got to say that even setting aside the bad service the filet I bought was just so-so. Afraid it's just not the RC of yesteryear."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it did not disappoint.  Catarina, our waitress, was very pleasant, friendly and helpful.  She really acted as though she cared about us and our experience.  The steaks were excellent and I loved the whole presentation.  There were at least three servers delivering the food and it very much added to the \"high class\" experience.  The augratin potatoes were amazing as well.  I don't often have this expensive of a meal but it was so worth it.  Delicious meal and fabulous ambience."}
{"text":"So my fiancé and I decided last minute on a Sunday to go out for a nice dinner. We had a mailer from Ruth Chris for 25 off a meal.  The service was great.

For salads, I had the wedge with the lemon basil dressing. It was pretty good. My fiancé had the Ceaser and it was great.

For dinner he had the twin lobster tails and I got the ribeye. For sides we had brussel sprouts and potatoes au gratin. My steak was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. His tails were overdone, enough to send back. We don't generally do that but it was pretty tough. The brussel sprouts were ok, I usually expect roasted sprouts to have some color and browning, these were pale and uninspiring.  The potatoes were good. When the tails came back out they were great. But by that time I was done.  So we didn't really get to enjoy the meal together.

It was just disappointing. At this price point I expect everything to be too notch.  The service by the staff in the bar area was top notch, no issues there."}
{"text":"This is the best atmosphere and food for a relaxing evening out. Low key or fancy, whatever suits your mood. 
Request Francisco as your waiter. He will give the best beverage recommendation, and educate you on your choice. His attentive service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"As always we had a great meal. Service was extremely attentive, and excellent overall. Food was great as usual. It's on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for when you eat here. Top notch food for the price. My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary and the staff made sure and made us feel very special on our special day. If there's any drawbacks it would be the amount of time spent waiting in between each course. Don't go there thinking you'll be in and out. With that said regardless of the wait time I would highly recommend Ruth's Chris in Harrahs on the LV strip looking for a truly great dining service!"}
{"text":"We come to this location all the time. We always have great service and great food! The service is fast and friendly. The restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms. If you don't make reservations try the bar area, if you can find a seat the service is awesome and you can order from the menu. We have had just about everything on the menu and they never disappoint. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"So so good. Service was great and the food was delicious!!! The decor here is very unique and interesting. Great ambience."}
{"text":"I've been to a few other Ruth's Chris's before and this one looked more like a hole in the wall.  If you weren't looking for it, you just might miss it.  Aside from the physical appearance on the outisde, the interior did lack some of the more romantic, dark, fine dining ambiance than other locations.  

 I came for a reception this time and found the food still very good.  Our Filet Mignon's came in hot plates.  The meat was tender and smelled delicious in the buttery sauce.  Our sides were mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and cream of spinach.  I did have higher expectations for the cream of spinach because Ruths Chris makes them the best. but this time it wasn't as creamy and it stuck like cheese a little.  in terms of quality, temperature, and taste of my Filet.  It was delicious especailly for a large party for a wedding banquet.  

Service was very good and efficient.  Enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great place to go for food poisoning!

Word to the wise - when an american restaurant has fine print on their menu saying that \"consuming undercooked meat products may cause illness\" that means that they don't have the faintest clue how to cook meat. The veggie options might be safe but considering that this steakhouse fails to cook it's namesake safely, I'd probably skip this fifth class restaurant altogether unless you're a biologist looking for bacteria samples.

I've traveled all over the world and ordered steak medium rare everywhere without getting food poisoning once - I come here and BOTH my friend and I who ordered two different cuts of steak spend the night  feverish, vomiting, and with diarrhea. The fine print is a cute way of trying to absolve themselves of responsiblity, but I've filed a complaint with dinesafe to make sure that health and safety standards are adhered to (because we like to do that in Canada).

There are hundreds of fantastic restaurants in Toronto, I strongly urge people to go there instead and not risk the incompetence of the \"chefs\" and the management."}
{"text":"Dollianne \"Dolly\" was super helpful from menu suggestions for a fabulous party of 5. Impressed for her cutting our meats to make sure each person in our party had the opportunity to get each cut as we ordered three different cuts. Loved her sass and jokes to entertain our party! Yasss Queen!"}
{"text":"Steak is phenomenon. But hugely overpriced. You can get equally good meats in other steakplaces in town for cheaper prices.
Not sure if I go back to this place exclusively for price/quality ratio."}
{"text":"The best filet minion in Toronto . Super smooth and melts in your mouth . Came here for winterlicious, great price point to try out different things. I had the Caesar salad as an app and I wasn't impressed . I also got to try the stuffed chicken I must say it was Delish."}
{"text":"Our night started out slow. Like, our waiter ignored us for 40 minutes slow....Well, after finally asking for a little attention our table was blessed with Jennifer the bar back cocktail waitress (I might have gotten that official title wrong here). She was amazing! Not sure why our first waitress was so weird and just abandoned us but I'm more than happy she did. Jennifer was the best! We will be back just because of her. Please give her a raise, a vacation, and match her 401k!"}
{"text":"As always, I had amazing service and excellent food.  Not normally a \"Chain\" kind of guy, but this is one of the better steak houses."}
{"text":"High-end steakhouses are tough to get a handle on review-wise. Due to the prices, expectations are high and consistency and quality are expected whether you are taking clients there on an expense account, have a special occasion, or just go there for dinner whenever. I have been to many Ruth's Chris locations throughout the country and this one is most deserving of a five-star review. The food has always been consistent and high quality, but it is the service that really sets it apart.   
The service standard here really is demonstrably higher than other steakhouses in Charlotte, and honestly a good bit better than other Ruth's Chris locations. That goes for hostesses, bartenders, expediters, manager, everybody. 

We always ask for Miles. There are several Michaels here but Michael Miles will make sure you are happy like nobody else, and he is who you want to ask for. He knows what to recommend and how to make sure your steaks come out just right, which is seemingly a rare thing these days. For example I got a completely well-done New York strip at Fleming's recently and the server actually argued with me that it was medium-rare. I don't take pictures of my food but I may start posting them just so somebody else doesn't waste $65 on an overcooked steak. Which reminds me, I need to review Fleming's. Medium rare is perfectly medium rare at this Ruth's Chris no matter what cut you order. I always order my steaks charred medium rare here, which is apparently Ruth's favorite, and similar to a Pittsburgh but done a touch above rare. Perfect if you ask me and they always get it right here. I just can't get this cook done right at any other steakhouse in Charlotte.

Anyway, you will definitely enjoy yourself at this Ruth's Chris location, and I can guarantee that if you make sure to ask for (Michael) Miles. There is a very high service standard here among everyone, but he is the best I have seen. Also, Chris Brown is a great manager who will make sure you are happy."}
{"text":"i admit, i'm one of the 'i'll only see you during Restaurant Week Mr. Fancy Pants Restaurant' people. 
i was very satisfied with my pork chop ($10 upgrade...yeah, big spender) and mashed potatoes. i thought i liked spinach these days, but wasn't a fan of it that night. Service all around was as good as it should be. 

Overall, excellent service and delicious food. Free valet was nice to see as we were wondering where to park on our way there. They were a little backed up, but nothing a short delay in the bar area can't fix. Actually let me watch some of the basketball game i would have missed otherwise."}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this restaurant if you can't use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE, and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition, the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance."}
{"text":"I love this place and here are the reasons:

(1) They know their frickin' steaks man!  Ok, the server we had was absolutely brilliant, knew her way around a cow for sure.  Excellent service, not too overbearing but had enough of a presence (and knowledge) to make the meal very enjoyable.

(2) Steak is expensive.  Those of you who deduct stars because of cost -- shame on you!  Go buy your own damned strip loin or t-bone and make it yourself.  A nice steak costs money, you should have known this before you decided to spend $100 on that meal.

(3) Tammy Y. (below) wrote: \"The rest of the meal though, as delicious as it was, was just too much heavy food in one go.\"  Wow.  Really?  Again, you're at a steakhouse -- not at Fresh eating tofu tartar drizzled with vegetable coulis.  Steak is big and filling.  Don't come here if you don't want to eat lots of food.

(4) I enjoy the a la carte.  The sides are really sharing plates.  Two sides (split between two) and an entree is more than enough.  I loved the spinach and scallops.  Fantastic. 

I'm deducting points for little things -- location, atmosphere, etc.  I don't like the idea of going to a hotel to eat, let alone trying to find the place.  The dining room was a bit smokey too, but I guess it's to be expected with a zillion steaks sizzling on hot plates."}
{"text":"I dine here about 5-6 times a year and continue to be blown away by the excellent service on each visit.  I always dine in the bar area and staff remembers my name and greets me even after not being there for multiple months.  Drinks never go more than half empty without being checked on.  Food is always excellent and any changes or special requests are always accomodated.  Vegas has more steakhouse choices than almost anywhere and I pick Ruths Chris everytime."}
{"text":"Love their food. We always compare the steaks we eat to the steaks here. Have never had a bad meal when dining here. Top notch and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our server Dean was AWESOME!!! The rest of it was ok. Food was adequate and completely overpriced. I don't mind paying prices like that when food is exceptional but I didn't find it to be anything special."}
{"text":"The service was good, although I found the support staff to be a bit chatty. Nice guy, but I didn't need him to give me a rundown on his plans to clear my table later in the evening! The ribeye was good, but I wasn't impressed by the sauteed mushrooms, and I love sauteed mushrooms. Also, the chocolate mousse cheesecake seemed like something I could have ordered at Applebee's. All in all though, it was reasonably priced for a steak with adequate service."}
{"text":"While I am giving Ruth's Chris a rating of A-OK, I would not recommend it to the average Las Vegas vacationer. There are so many restaurants in Las Vegas, I would say just go somewhere else. We came to Ruth's Chris specifically because we usually have a good experience at Ruth's Chris, and wanted something tried and true. My husband even surprised me with a giftcard to use for the occasion. The server was very nice and attentive. However, the restaurant was off the strip,  which we knew ahead of time, but we were not crazy about it when we got there. It was in some weird strip mall. The food just didn't wow me either. I asked for medium well. The outside of the steak was very charred and the inside was barely medium at parts. No problem with the service, but the food itself just wasn't that impressive, especially for what you're paying."}
{"text":"One of the best Vegas Steak Houses!  Ovens are 1800 degrees so cooked to perfection.  I came with a team from all over the world and had a great dining experience. We ordered a few different appetizers to share, salads, the beefsteak tomato and onion salad.  I had a rib-eye and fries, baked tomatoes, asparagus and other sides to share and it was really great.

We finished off with Irish coffees.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"so far this is the only place i've come back to get a steak in town. I have yet to find a place in town that has a steak as tender as ruth chris's.

{"text":"This place is great!  The location and the hours are a little unusual so be sure you research in advance where you are going if you are not familiar with downtown CLE. The bone in fillet may have been the best steak that I have ever had. We also opted for the Seafood Tower which is a stunning centerpiece and well worth it if you feel like splurging on something unique. The staff are attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. Very impressed."}
{"text":"I was there on a busy Stampede kickoff kind of day, so I'll excuse the service this time, but to be honest, even for the day, the service wasn't anything to write home about. I found the service at the door and at the bar better than that actual serving staff. 

Ruth's Chris sells itself as a higher-end steakhouse, with the prices to match, so the service (no matter the occasion) should live up to the image it portrays. 

The food itself was pretty good- maybe a 7 out of 10. 

All-in-all, it's not a bad place to go, but there are a lot of steakhouses out there, so choose carefully."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouse chains.  The steak has been awesome in about five of the different cities I have tried it in (only San Francisco sucked)  Las Vegas is one of the best.  I got a HUGE filet that was cooked perfect, and some sort of cheesy broccoli that was awesome as a side.  Tried a few of the other sides and they were great too.  My co-workers got the Bananas Foster and it was amazing.  Worth every penny"}
{"text":"I used to like their food
Honestly.

It was my one year anniversary.
Me and me man went here to celebrate

I had a lobster tail
And a filet

On the way home, I got violently ill
Like, within ten minutes of leaving this place.
And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)

I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc

After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore
I called 911

The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.

It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.

After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.

I'll never eat here again.
Simply because I've never been so sick.

It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.

HOWEVER
I contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.

Although, Boo for almost killing me.

Eh, I'm torn."}
{"text":"Audrey was awesome with our whole experience. He was very entertaining and informed about the location."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas for literally any reason at all around happy hour and you're near Harrah's, come here. We showed up about 45 minutes before HH ended, so we ended up rushing to order drinks, our food, and an additional round, but it was well worth it. I had the Filet sandwich, which was just delightful, with the white wine butter sauce and the garlic bread, what a great HH meal for like $12 also all beers were $5 IN VEGAS. WHAT A STEAL. 

Also a pro tip from a friend of mine who is a big time Ruth Chris aficionado, if you do the Filet sandwich at HH and order it with no bread it comes out the same as the high dollar filet usually would, and you saved about $40-50. 

We caught a little attitude from our waiter at the end of our meal, so that cost them a star, but it is what it is. Other than that, for this being my first time at a Ruth Chris, I was thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"We dined at Ruth's Chris because we wanted someplace special to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Our server, Jennifer, was very attentive and did an excellent job--along with our busser, Kharoline.  A short time after taking our orders, a basket of warm bread was delivered to our table.  Both my husband and I ordered the petite filet mignon.  It was served to us sizzling hot and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered three side dishes--corn, sweet potato casserole, and augratin potatoes.  All three side dishes were delicious.  We planned to order a dessert to take home, but Jennifer served us a complimentary mini raspberry cheesecake with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate across the plate.  Our dining experience at RC did not disappoint.  It was wonderful from start to finish!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Ruth's Chris for Good Friday dinner this year. With a party of 17 I'm sure we were no picnic to take care of, but it ended up being the most perfect dining experience! We had two servers, Ken and Adam, and they did an AMAZING job! The service was professional and fast, and the waiters had unlimited patience for my vegetarian diet. Ken was totally the Godfather of Ruth's Chris menu, he knew EVERYTHING and was very attentive. Adam waited on the other half of the table, so we didn't get get chat, but my brother and I talked him into jumping into a photo with us at the end, he was a cool guy and a great waiter as well! 

The food itself was on a whole new level. My boyfriend and my brother both had the Cowboy Steak, which was HUGE. They haven't stopped talking about how delicious it was for the past week. Grandma had the Chilean Sea Bass, which she said was cooked to perfection. Being a vegetarian I ordered the side item platter with asparagus with hollandaise, creamed spinach, and sweet potato casserole. All of my sides were absolutely perfect, and the casserole was so good I could have easy eaten ten more bowls. 

Dessert was even better (if that's even possible!) I had the Creme Brûlée, which I was reluctant to share with Aunt Barb, because it was so darn good! My boyfriend had the Chocolate Sin Cake, which I'm fairly certain was sent from the gods above. 

Overall it was an absolutely splendid dining experience and I would recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone! (Definitely try the sweet potato casserole)"}
{"text":"I went here many years ago but it was at different locations in Vegas, but this time I took my boyfriend out for his birthday. Let's just say the experience was amazing! Our waiter though I cannot recall his name was absolutely helpful and made sure everything was satisfaction. You will not be disappointed if you order the filet with shrimp, it actually came out as two filets! And I highly highly recommend the creamed spinach which was melt in your mouth heaven! And the view of the strip is pretty cool. Overall I give this place a gold star for wonderful behavior."}
{"text":"Food, service and ambiance were all perfection. We came here as a \"just 'cause\" date night because well, sometimes you want to be fancy, and this was one of those times.

Our servers, Kyle and Vincent, were amazingly attentive and were good for a bit of joking around, but weren't bugging us at any point. the dining room was nice and quiet (but not dead or boring or anything), and the hostess was nice enough to accommodate us at a table where we could sit side by side versus across from each other (it's how we like to eat ha), so despite being a party of two, she gave us a lovely 4 seater by the windows and we snuggled up to each other while we chatted and waited for all the food to come out. Once it did, we definitely needed to sit further apart to make room for the sheer volume of food we were going to put away.

We ordered the T-Bone, Bone-In Sirloin (both Med Rare); Wild Mushrooms, Baked Potato, Au Poivre Sauce; with Heineken (him) and Dry Prosecco (me) to drink, and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. 

While I've eaten at Ruth's Chris (different location) before, my partner never had and loves steaks, but had never had one of such high quality. We enjoyed taking bites of each other's steaks and it was fun to see that they were both so different and yet so delicious. I'd almost consider getting mine rare next time, the quality is just divine. The mushrooms had a wonderful, garlic-infused buttery sauce they were drowning in and well a baked potato is just great comfort food. Small things made this so much fun, simple things like the knifework on the chives on top of our baked potato (seriously, so fine and delicate) just made me feel like we were eating well, and oh my god, we were wedged by the time we were done with our mains, but I insisted on dessert because I'm a human being, and flourless chocolate cake is not something i'm saying no to (and I pretty much never, ever order dessert. First time in 2016 I've done it). 

the cake is gorgeous, dense, and served with a rasberry puree and a fresh strawberry. no critique, just wonderful. 

Some people are concerned about upscale dining due to portions so I'll tell you now - this is not at all going to be a problem at Ruth's. Even my 'smaller' sirloin was 14oz, the tbone is between 20-24oz. If we did it again (oh and bet your ass we will), we'd get one steak or a smaller steak for one of us, and just one side, there just isn't enough room in the average couple to consume two of their steaks, two of their sides, dessert, and a glass or two of beer/wine. My partner had i think 3 beers, but i just had one glass, so that may impact our total, but all in with all our drinks, food, and addon sauce, it came out to about $250, so $300 after tip. We are not rich folk, but it is worth every damn penny. I'd say if we eased up on how much we ordered we'd be as satiated but could make it even more reasonable. And yes, to me, this experience for just $300 canadian, is definitely reasonable. it's absolutely luxurious, fun, and the portions are endless (i'm eating part 1 of 2 of our leftovers as I write this). 

Thanks so much to Kyle, Vincent, and the rest of the Ruth's Chris family for making our evening so memorable."}
{"text":"I forgot what I ate here while on our first stop of bar hopping, I told the male server we are on bar hopping and we asked where else can he suggest. He said try also 17th avenue bars"}
{"text":"The quality and menu is spot-on Ruth's Chris.  They do what they do.  They do it well.  However, with that being said, we were rushed through our meal, and although it was a special occasion, a birthday celebration, and this was pre-arranged with the reservation... that did not matter.

Also, it was odd.  At the end, in the push to get us out.. the waiter still asked the birthday person what they wanted for their dessert, then brought out both a \"complimentary\" house dessert with candle AND then a second dessert, which was ultimately not needed, and then we were charged for this one, too.  So, four desserts, three people, and hardly any time to enjoy.  And we begged for a second cup (refill) of our coffee to go with.  They charge enough for it! 

Over-all, pretty nervy.  There are many top-notch steaks available in Charlotte.  I think I'll be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Took my BF here for his birthday, along with our close friends. We had no troubles with getting a table, I made reservations ahead of time. We were seated and given plenty of time to choose. Our server was very informative to help us decide what to get. We all ordered steak (duh?), and 4 sides: mushrooms, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, and shoe string fries. Our steaks varied from filets to ribeyes. We got warm, glistening bread during our wait.I had their butter lettuce BLT salad, and it was very good even though I'm not a big fan of blue cheese it worked very well with the dressing. They made sure our food all came out together, and the plates are super hot. My filet was a bit too overcooked but it's understandable due to the smaller size. If you do order a smaller size portion this is common. I got more medium versus medium rare. The sides were delicious, I really enjoyed the mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin. We all enjoyed our food, and side portions allowed us to share everything. They are very good with keeping notes on special occasions, so nothing was really needed to be said to our server she knew what to do. Our desserts were sooo good. We first had the raspberry cheesecake (love the crust), and the rich chocolate cake for his surprise cake. Then we ordered more dessert to share: the chocolate chip bread pudding (amazing), and the creme brulee (amazing too). Throughout the whole time we were there, we were never rushed. Staff came to check up on us and always made sure our waters were topped up. 
Yes this restaurant is very pricey, but it is for special occasions only. The quality of service and food is different then anywhere we have been before.
Our dinner was easy and effortless, the service and food was great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Good news for all you bulimics!
This food is so rich, it'll come right back up just as quick as it went down - and with no finger-coaxing!

I told my wife I was sick, but she never listens (kinda like me). 
Anyway, we rounded out restaurant week here with a 12 oz. ribeye, some creamed spinach, and tempura battered onion rings.
All of it was damned tasty, even on a sick stomach.

Sadly, for anyone leaving after us, they would have had to negotiate my dinner on the sidewalk in front of the elevator. 
Also, my wife, whose shoes got caught by some wayward spinach splash, was pretty bummed, although I'm not sure why.
I can't figure out if it was her ruined shoes, or if she was upset we just spent 170 bucks and half of it wound up on a sidewalk.

Anyways, my sincere apologies to management, and, the poor shite who had to clean up the mess."}
{"text":"Best steak in Charlotte hands down! I've eaten here numerous times with my family and have always received the same excellent quality food and service. This place truly goes over and beyond to earn your business."}
{"text":"My husband I I went here when our favourite steak house (Modern Steak) was closed on date night. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and the chicken bites for appetizers, neither of us like the mushrooms at all and we were shocked that they were a favourite. The chicken was good, tasted like a higher end version of ginger chicken, not fantastic. We both ordered Rib eye for our main entree which we both loved, we very much enjoyed how is was severed on a hot sizzling plate and enjoyed every bite. Sides were Brussel sprouts, scalloped potatoes and corn, all of which were decent, my husband kindly suggested that my version of all three are much better. Overall we had fun and left full, but at that price point compared to the quality of food, most likely won't return."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, mainly for birthday celebrations. We usually show up PHX casual (shorts) and nobody seems to care. Nice, not really stuffy atmosphere. The service is quite good, can be a little hit and miss, depending on the waiter. Some seem a bit more professional and knowledgeable. Overall, they know their stuff. The steaks are excellent. Love the new orleans shrimp. The cheese cake is very good.  It is pricey but we always leave stuffed. For a once or twice a year treat, go for it."}
{"text":"What a surprising disappointment; this restaurant is a shadow of what it used to be. My wife and I have visited El Chorro, Barrio Queen and Eddie V's for AZ Restaurant Week, and they were all delightful. This was an expensive disappointment, that featured a taciturn, awkward server; an undrinkable Pinot Noir which I promptly returned; a tired, half-dead salad with bottled dressing thrown on top; and an OK but uninspired steak (compared to Mastro's, Ocean Club or even Texas Road House). Not recommended."}
{"text":"Great as always! Had the crab cakes with a filet and mashed potatoes. Stuffed to the brim and lovin' it."}
{"text":"I have been to both of the Vegas locations 2 times. I know what to expect from this place. I love what I get each and every time. If i dont I expect them to take care of me. Thats what I expect."}
{"text":"The food did not disappoint. The reason for 3 stars vs 5? The service! Very casual greeting from the Hostess. There was a 30 min wait so she pointed to the bar area and told us that we could seat ourselves and dine in there. Didn't walk us to the table, didn't offer a menu...so we sat ourselves. No waitstaff greeted us so after several minutes, we just went and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice enough, never brought bread until I asked for it. For $207 I would expect better service! There are too many steak houses in Vegas to return to this one!"}
{"text":"My significant other (SO) and I visited Ruth`s Chris on May 29th, 2015. We were greeted immediately by the hostess and seated as soon as we entered in. The bread was there before I even knew someone put it there, which is always a plus. The waitress (who I did not get the name unfortunately) was very nice and was very attentive.

We shared Sizzling Blue Crab Cakes ($24) Cowboy Rib Steak ($75), Sweet Potato Casserole ($12), Creamed Spinach ($12).

Blue Crab Cake:
Do not make a mistake of getting the meal size of blue crab cake if you want it for appetizer. You get 3 at price of $36 instead of 2 at price of $24. We each had one. I found the flavour was good - it was salted at the right level and we saw plenty of crab meat in the cake. What I did notice with my crab cake was that it was not hot all the way through the centre. This was served on a hot plate,so I was able to \"heat up\" the cake by mashing it little bit. The cake was served with butter underneath it, which initially did not feel so bad... until we got to the cowboy steak. 

Cowboy Rib Steak:
You ever had a stick of butter with your butter? If you never had it, here is your chance. My first question after the meal was: why ruin perfectly fine steak by drenching it in a pool of butter? And this is how I felt after 3 bites. Steak was about 24 oz bone-in, which was shareable between my SO and I. I felt steak was okay - or that's what I would have said if I could actually taste the steak. Due to over-excessive amount of butter, I was not even able to determine the quality of meat properly. As far as I know, this is as good as keg steak but with butter. lots of butter. I cant just say enough of how much butter there was. In fact, I can't believe this was not butter! By the end of meal, my mouth felt so buttery that I had to put some soap on my mouth to get all the oil off from me. 

Sweet Potato Casserole:
This was so sweet - we ended not ordered dessert because, well, this was the dessert. The taste was fine but man, this was not a side. It was not complementary of the meal due to its sweetness. If you want a nice hot dessert, consider ordering this. If you want a side, don't. 

Creamed Spinach:
My SO did not like this at all. The creamed spinach, as the name suggests, had plenty of cream. Again, other than the blue crab cake we had, why did everything taste so heavy? I needed some carbs to cut down the heaviness so the bread that came with the meal helped. Again, with such buttery and heavy steak, this is something I would highly not recommend. 

I was contemplating between giving 2 or 3 star for the restaurant. However, after much thought, this is not a place I would recommend given the price point. For the price you are paying, you are virtually not getting the quality of food you would expect from other competitors at the similar price range, such as Harbor Sixty or Jacobs. The service was excellent - the waitress was attentive and all the servers were very nice. However, service alone cannot justify the re-visit at this price point. Would I go back? Only if I can get a significant discount (around 66%) like I did for this visit (from their anniversary gift card sale)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a throwback in time. The food was good, and the service was excellent - We had a party of 7 and the food was served fairly quickly. There is zero attention paid to the display of the food. The restaurant itself is in a strip mall far from the other casinos- 
and does not appear to have been updated since the 80s. For the price of the food, they need to update the place- the uniforms, the curtains, the decor-- 80s Vegas. 
Even though the food was very good- I wouldn't go back- there are too many other places in Vegas where you can spend $100 a person and get a better vibe. The manager on duty was wearing too tight black pants and chewing gum? Doesn't seem appropriate."}
{"text":"I will say Ruth's Chris is consistent when providing quality food and service. We live in Newport Beach so Irvine is the location we frequent most but have been to Phoenix, Palm Springs, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Woodland Hills, Kona, Maui, and Oahu. 

My husband and I always bring our own wine, share an appetizer, share a salad and share a filet (always juicy and tender) along with the au gratin potatoes. Sometimes we get dessert (banana creme pie yum!) sometimes not but our bill is rarely over $100.00 before tip.  We've been to Flemings and I am convinced they are more expensive and the food is not as good, the last time we went there in Newport they sat us downstairs in a dungeon like room, to which I said \"uh no\".

IMO you must dine at a Ruth's Chris before you die and judge for yourself, the portions are huge so you can share and still leave feeling stuffed.  

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse known the man! The steak just melted in your mouth!  Service was amazing!  I wish I could eat here every single day"}
{"text":"Had a GroupOn and let me tell you.. Wow. What a great meal. Quiet Sunday night when I arrived. A group of women from SEC country were there. They were super friendly and had been coming for over 20 years together. Had a great meal. Bartender friendly. Just a great time."}
{"text":"We had a great time here tonight. As it's Tuesday, it was nice that the restaurant wasn't packed with a weekend crowd. We got a res about an hour before arriving.
Our party of 4 had: a bottle of Spanish red, the Caesar salad, the Wedge salad, the lobster bisque, the tbone, their fall specialty entree of bistro filet topped with crab, their fall specialty entree of filet medallions topped with scallops, the potatoes au gratin, the cauliflower au gratin, shoestring fries, cheesecake, and Ruth's coffee (spiked with Bailey's and other goodies).
The steak entrees and their seafood accompaniments were superb. The cauliflower was delicious while the other sides (potatoes au gratin and fries) were just ok. I was disappointed by my wedge salad, but my friend said the Caesar was on point. 
Our waiter was great, though he did disappear for long periods of time throughout the night. Not a big deal, as we had plenty of food and drink to occupy us and were enjoying catching up with friends. It's possible we were so caught up in our conversation he didn't want to pester or disturb us. Like I said, not exactly complaining, but it was something I noticed. 
This was my second RCS visit, first at this location. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"What you would expect for a high end steak house. Well trained waiters, decent food and nice atmosphere. Two of us had steaks which were perfect as well as the hash browns served family style (no onion thankfully) and other sides were equally good. The down side was the special of the night, lamb chops. There were three very large chops and for some reason I couldn't cut them with a serrated knife. I have had them many times before and have never had this happen. I tried sawing and poking and almost resorted to sticking it in my mouth and eating like I would have at home. Tearing it off the bone like a starving German Shepard. The few pieces I did saw off were very good but I left most of them on the plate. It wasn't worth the hassle. My companion had the same problem and was doing her best to get something off the bone as well. The manager stopped by to see how thing were going and I told her. She said maybe I needed a sharper knife. Really! If it would have been a steak would I have got the same response? Maybe a power saw? Thankfully I wasn't picking up the tab and this was probably an isolated incident but I expected more from a place like this. I should have taken the remains home to disect  them to see what the problem was. It was too dark in the restaurant  to actually see when we were eating. Oh well."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that after my Yelp and reaching out to Ruth Chris management that I did not even receive a phone call.  Will not be   taking my nephew (a total of 6 or us) to Sacramento Ruth Chris because of our terrible experience in Scottsdale.  I will never ever go back to the Scottsdale location.

Hello Anna C.

Thank you for taking the time to respond.  We will surely be dining @ the Sacramento location, as we have always had the best experience at this location and so many others.  I will let you know when we are going.  Thank you very much.

Per reading the Ruth Chris Yelps....it seems like you have a few problems  regarding standards of quality in every area of your restaurants.  I am sure with customer service with high standards the issues will be addressed and concerned.  Thank you Anna C.  Again, I will be in touch as to when you shall be returning."}
{"text":"We have dined at this location so many times and I cannot say enough about the consistent quality of food! The service is always top notch regardless of it we are on a date night or a family dinner! Highly recommend for both!"}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse. They get the cook right the first time. I took my nephew here for his birthday and everyone was satisfied. I forgot to get my discount and the manager gave me a personally written discount for my next visit."}
{"text":"This Ruth's Chris is located at the Harrah's Casino on Las Vegas Blvd. It is on the second floor and one would take a dedicated elevator to its front doors. We had a very early reservation and avoided the crowd. The service was exceptional from seating to food selection. 
We had the Chopped Salad to start then followed with a New York Steak and Filet Mignon. The  Chopped salad was one of the better salads that I have had in a long time. Crisp, Fresh and flavorful. 
The Steaks were cooked to the right temperature however they could have been better. We have been to Ruth's Chris all over the country and are familiar with the tastes of the steak dishes. These were slightly off and not soft. I don't think that we got the best cuts that evening. I want to state that the steaks were NOT bad however they weren't to the caliber of the Ruth's Chris steaks that we were accustomed to eating."}
{"text":"Nice visit while on vacation in the area. Party of 7, all from out of town on vacation. We enjoyed our visit, had excellent service and very good food.

The location was beautiful and the views were a big plus while enjoying our dinner. As we've come to expect from Ruth's Chris, everything was great. We'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Another awesome experience.  We eat here every 4-6 weeks.  I definitely put it above the competing steak houses (Flemings, Donovan's).  This place has the quality and consistency down pat.  I had the bone in 16Oz filet; awesome.  I've owned restaurants for over 20 years and really appreciate the little details of quality service. Service is awesome. Our server last night was Kirsten.  She actually remembered us from our visit in June based on our order.  In addition to Kirsten, the entire staff does a great job of teaming up on your service.  You lack for nothing.  A nice touch was having the General Manager Michael stop by the table and talk."}
{"text":"Usually I don't dine at such establishments but I was graciously invited as part of a company dinner. The wait staff were very polite and served us well for the entire evening. The ambiance is quite top notch as we were reserved a private room with a massive table. As for the food, I have to say it was pretty good and matched the high price tag. Overall, a pretty good evening with service that meets expectations."}
{"text":"We had dined on occasion at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse when we lived in the South Park area of Charlotte and chose to dine there to enjoy their Thanksgiving dinner menu this year. Although the management had changed, the level of service and food quality did not on what was a very busy day for them. Moist turkey, yummy traditional stuffing & other fixins, it was a delightful meal and wonderful, stress free way to enjoy the holiday. Hey Ruth's Chris, how about opening up a branch in Ballantyne??"}
{"text":"Went for Charlotte Restaurant Week in Thursday night. Overall the service and good were great. We all had the 6 oz tenderloin filet and each added a compliment to our steaks--scallops, shrimp and the creole crab. We all liked the salads, the entrees and the sides. If you want to switch out a side off the fixed menu, you can but there is a up charge. Not a huge deal. The sides are smaller than normal but still enough to share. One steak had to be sent back because they didn't prepare as requested due to allergies to the butter. Dessert was chocolate bark and mini cheesecake. Everyone commented how good the food was and that it was just the right size. Service was attentive and spot on.  I have always thought Ruth Chris had the better steak of all the higher end steakhouses---tonight didn't disappoint. They were well prepared for Charlotte Restaurant Week. I go several times a year to various Ruth Chris locations and have found them to always be consistent."}
{"text":"Talk about an over priced meal! I can't sugar coat this review whatsoever because I truly had high hopes for this place! I always hear so many mixed opinions about Ruth Chris and always wanted to try! I finally had the chance to experience this place this past weekend! My cousin celebrated her birthday here in Vegas and I thought what better opportunity to grab a nice dinner! She had been to Ruth Chris in another city so I wasn't as hesitant to try it out! Booked my reservation online through opentable as normal. Upon arriving we were greeted promptly by a nice hostess and seated in a perfect table against the window to overlook the strip! So far so good! The waiter was nice recommended us a couple of their signature Martinis. We chose the red velvet cupcake and the seduce me! Both prepared excellent! Here is where things start to take a turn! After reviewing the menu for some time my cousin decided on their 3 course meal which she ordered the Caesar salad and the salmon! Her dish was fantastic! My order was the Cowboy Ribeye Steak w/ blue cheese crumbles. Now let me start by saying I am a true steak person and I know an excellent steak when I get one. I was very underwhelmed with this $61 steak because the taste was so bland and there was a ton of fat on this cut! I have had steaks extremely better at like 35 Steaks & Martinis or even Delmonico or something! I had to ask myself how is it that they nailed the Salmon dish but completely missed the steak!? A dish that they are supposedly specializing in? By far the worst I've had! No $61 steak should just be average! I had to keep in good spirits because of my cousins birthday but lastly how about this terrible quadruple chocolate cake they give out on birthdays? It's WAY too much chocolate matter of the fact I don't even think it's cake! It's basically a fudge bar! In summary I pretty much wasted $200 on an average ass meal! I'll never return! My first time will be the last.. Period!"}
{"text":"I took my Wife to Ruth's Chris for her birthday.    We were met at the reception desk with a Happy Birthday greeting and our table was sprinkled with  little Happy Birthday  confetti pieces.  These were a nice touch and a great way to start the evening.  

My wife ordered the filet, I had the Chilean sea bass.  Both were excellent, but after sharing tastes, I would have to say that my wife had the winning entree.  In fact, my wife claimed it was one of the best filets she has ever eaten.  Considering that we go to Las vegas 3 or 4 times a year and treat ourselves to big name restaurants, her glowing endorsement has credible weight behind it.   Throw in a couple sides that were large enough to share, drinks and desserts (my wife's birthday dessert was free) and the bill came out to about $175.  Not bad for a great eating experience."}
{"text":"this is the third time i have made a reservation  this year for a large party.  every time we have made the reservation  you must ask.   Do you have Lamb? or do you have Filet mignon.  Every time they don't have the food on the menu.  How embarrassing when you take out a party of twelve only for an anniversary that ruth Chris
steakhouse doesn't have steak or prime rib or Lamb,  that we can have chicken?  Their excuse is that they ran out , or  they are stopping carrying LambChops. and the third was  the cattle that were  shipped was bad.  they get you in then have you order  something else  than what you went to the restaurant for. The first 2 times i thought OK  but this is the third time.  don't you think they should have someone ordering enough food?  the manager whom is a lady was very rude and could care less."}
{"text":"As usual the Filet steaks are about the best. The Service was excellent and the ambiance supurb. I new that the bill was going to be expensive so I was not surprised when it came. I would recommend this restaurant highly."}
{"text":"Conclusion: Not worth the price.


The Good:

Delicious sweet potato casserole with pecan crust.  They split our orders onto separate plates. We mentioned it was our anniversary and they gave us a chocolate cake.


The Bad:

Tough steak... dry. Not worth the price!

Staff felt like they were \"trying\" but the true feel of \"fine dining\" was not there. The staff may have been trained, but they just couldn't get the little touches to complete the fine part of fine dining. For example:
 - the staff would get into the way while they attempt to pour water. 
 - Staff would interrupt the conversation to ask their question. I was going to finish my sentence before letting the staff ask their question, but she rudely interrupted. 
 - We had to ask wait staff to find our waiter to get our check
 - They never cleaned the table throughout the appetizers, salad, entrees, etc.
 - The items above were all things that the staff in San Diego's Ruth's Chris was very good at. I read a review saying the old business at this Las Vegas location was another steakhouse but Ruth's Chris now has a majority of the staff from that location. If the old staff was not truly capable of \"fine dining\", this Ruth's Chris staff will only bring down the experience of what this restaurant could bring. (Perhap's Ruth's Chris has a contract with Harrah's to use existing staff. . . either way, not a good wait staff for this type of restaurant.)

Cowboy ribeye at San Diego's Ruth's Chris, is my all time favorite. I've had it 4-6 times. This Las Vegas location, seemed like they sourced their steak meat from the buffet. Perhaps Harrah's has a vendor they go through for all the food of all the restaurants inside their property, which would limited Ruth's Chris quality."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go eat in Charlotte, NC. Always great service and food."}
{"text":"We (nursing organization, attendees and I) had a wonderful dinner and event that was held here at Ruth Chris'.  The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The four course meal included: balsamic vinaigrette salad, your choice of: petite filet, chicken and or fish and garlic mashed potatoes, creamy spinach and for desert: toasted coconut-pineapple-creme brûlée-bread pudding and a side of dark chocolate with macadamia nuts and toasted coconut. I absolutely LOVED their filet mignon. It was excellent medium-rare.  A special thank you to NAHN and Bayer for sponsoring. We had the event in their private area that was secluded with partition sliding doors, it was very comfortable and nicely decorated. I wouldn't mind returning for future events and of course the filet mignon! :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always. Had the usual baroque shrimp. Absolutely creamy deliciousness. Stuffed mushrooms always one of my favorites. Maybe not for others though, they tend to be on the mushy side and very garlicky. 

For the dinner wine we had the Robert Mondavi 2012 red Cabernet. Ordered the rib eye and the bone in rib eye, both rare. Both delectable in their own individual ways. For me I personally prefer the rib eye. Our bone in rib eye was over cooked to medium rare. The rib eye for some reason tastes more tender. I have had both many times at other Ruth Chris locations and had the same result. For the sides we got the lobster mac and cheese and the cream spinach. I always order the creamed spinach, it is my favorite side. The lobster mac and cheese was a first for me. I would not order it again. The green peppers were overpowering and the Mac and cheese was not that tasty unfortunately. 

For dessert we ordered the berries and sweet cream sauce and the cheesecake. Both my favorite for different reasons. The cream sauce is to die for. So delicious. The cheesecake is very rich and cheesy. The only thing I would say is that ordering the two together is not recommended since the sweet cream sauce is so sweet takes away from cheesecake. 

Our server, Darcel was probably the most disappointing aspect of the night. She seemed very rushed and most of the time was loud, but inaudible. When I asked her to decant the wine she looked at me weird and did not want to. She would disappear on us for 10 minutes intervals and we had to ask other servers to get things and help with the check. Just all in all an uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"I went to Ruth's for my boyfriend's birthday, and the restaurant provided excellent service to us! Malcolm, the waiter who served us was exceptional. He had great knowledge about the menu items, and he gave good recommendation for red wine to go with our steak as well.

We had the Porterhouse steak to share, with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes as sides. Their steaks are mostly USDA prime cut. The Porterhouse had fillet on one side of the bone, and strip on the other. It's served on a sizzling hot plate. They also gave us each a plate drizzled with hot butter, so that we can cover the steak in butter as we eat it. My boyfriend, who is a huge steak fanatic, said that this was the best steak he has ever had! The sides were great as well, I thought the mashed potatoes were delicious.

I had called in advance to notify the restaurant that the dinner was for a birthday. And so, they prepared a slice of chocolate flourless cake with my boyfriend's name written on the side. I thought it was a very nice gesture. The restaurant is fairly upscale, I really enjoyed this dining experience!"}
{"text":"Service-mediocre as others stated . We had a lady that wasn't very attentive. There was a really cute waiter with dreads that helped us much more than our server. And they were out of a lot of things

Drinks-I had the blueberry mojito and Manhattan. Both delicious and you can taste the alcohol.

Food-only ordered appetizers. Spicy lobster was delicious. A must try. Angus burger just ok."}
{"text":"This is strictly a place to go during Restaurant Week. The prices simply do not justify the middling quality. There are many higher quality steakhouses in the Madison area that will not break your budget.

The three course meal opened with lobster bisque, which was quite pleasant but didn't come close to even being a small cup of soup. The petite filet seemed very much under 8 oz and tasted so plain. The sauteed mushrooms were okay, but also nothing to write home about. I do give mad props for the delicious chocolate mousse dessert in the edible chocolate cup.

All in all, I spent $30 for a meal that would have normally been $68. Great restaurant week value, but still doesn't meet the expectation when you spend that much."}
{"text":"Took off 1 star for the price....I mean I know it's high end, but still way too pricey for my burger.  Otherwise, everything was really good!!"}
{"text":"Alexander Morse gave us a wonderful experience. He was very friendly. We really enjoyed his attentiveness to refills and clearing plates. He managed to strike conversation without being intrusive. Unfortunately, there was no way to tip him because he is in training, however, know if you have him as your server assistant, your time at Ruth's Chris will be very pleasant. James is also a great waiter."}
{"text":"Went there for my son's 16th birthday. We started of with the Voodoo shrimp. Don't miss it, it is fantastic. Spicey biting flavour with perfect texture, melt in your mouth smooth. We had the porterhouse, New York strip, Ribeye and filet mignon with schrimp. All cooked to perfection. Do me a favour and just wait a few seconds and just take in the smell of the steak before you eat it. You won't regret it. We had the roasted corn, mashed potato and cream spinach sides. Perfect! Meal was served with great service. Wished I had his name. He was a tall distinguished looking middle aged man with grey hair. Great confidence, grace and perfect timing. Old time service. So Classy. The ambiance is traditional with a lot of wood. Personally I like it a bit brighter but overall ambiance was all class. One the best meals anywhere. Not cheap but worth the money. Do yourself a favour and go to Costco and get 2x $50 gift card for $80 to save your self some money. You can use one card per person. Parking is in the hotel underground at the Hilton. Bonus was my son got a free piece of chocolate cake. Huge slice so we could all share it and it had nice birthday decorations on it. Hey like I said, all class!"}
{"text":"Been to Minneapolis and Chicago Ruth's Chris (wonderful) and somehow Madison/Middleton managed to screw it up. 

It was my companions birthday so they had the table decorated with glitter which really took away  from the class of the place- Save that for Friday's or Chotchkies. 

Unfortunately it was not busy so the atmosphere was that of a funeral and since the floor manager had nothing else to do he basically stared at our table from a distance all night.  

The server had a thick Eastern European accent which was I was able to understand but most folks would have a terrible time understanding him.  Additionally I found his personality cold.  Within seconds of being seated, our server asked for our drink order but there hadn't been enough time to even open the wine menu so we sent him away.  He did not return for such along time that we were able to pick our wines, apps. and our entrees.  Just as we were about to abort our dinner completely for lack service, he arrived again.  We placed the entire order- that was our mistake.  Clearly he fired everything at once because the wine and apps came at one time and the entrees arrived before our appetizer plates were cleared. What's the hurry?   
 
Food was just ok - no need to go back.   

Stick to your local options- Tornado, Harvest, Tempest, Blue Marlin etc."}
{"text":"I'll be going to Steak 44 from now on... the chicken looked scary and our server was acting as if he worked in a Denny's... ?"}
{"text":"We came here for Restaurant Week back in May. 
First they were very gracious and accommodating, because I messed up big time.

We showed up on Saturday and I had made the reservations for the day before : (
We were a group of 4 and ended up sitting at the bar, but it was nice and quiet.

Food was good as always and the only glitch I remember is that the desert hubby ordered was tiny, and was a lot of chocolate, which was not in the name or description I think because he does not like chocolate. I think it was the cheesecake, not sure.

Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"I went there with friends as a spur of the moment decision since we were already having some beers at the Hilton at their Tundra bar.   Since it was a Wednesday night the two of us got in very quickly and they accommodated us nicely with a booth seat.

The service was excellent, very quick and attentive. Having never been at any Ruth Chris's before I appreciated the waiter explaining how things worked; about portions, the heat of the plates etc.

My friend and I agreed on the porterhouse for two ($125) and a bottle of wine ($59).   The wine came out quickly and was properly decanted and very soon afterwards the steak came out.   We also ordered a side of creamed spinach to share.

I was very disappointed by the steak for two reasons:
1. For the price it didn't have the melt-in-mouth flavour, in fact I commented to my friend that it almost tasted like it had been frozen... he agreed
2. Again for the price, the size of the steak was actually quite small.   A porterhouse generally should be substantial for two men like us.

Like I said, I have never been there before but wanted to give it a try because of the promise of a quickly seared steak which is all the better if you like yours medium rare.   However I don't think that the quality and quantity matches the price you are paying here.   I regret not going to Hy's or even the Keg.

I travel extensively to New York and have been to a lot of the steak houses there including Peter Lugers so I have a lot to compare to."}
{"text":"We returned for another great meal. The service was excellent and the steaks were cooked exactly as ordered. We didn't get a window view this time, but the table was great anyway! If I had to say one negative thing, I would say that the steaks weren't quite as good as a couple other comparably priced restaurants we ate at last weekend, but the service and atmosphere made up for it."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris, served me and my business partners is an excellent steak dinner,
We ordered tons of appetizers and exclusive red wines,, The staff was very knowledgeable, you can't go wrong at Ruth Chris of Scottsdale,"}
{"text":"For a chain this (flamingo ave) Ruths chris is in my top ten of all times!
Open till 3am awesome wine great steak and service. I have been to four RC's and I think this is the best."}
{"text":"These were the items we ordered: 

11 oz Filet with shrimp - very buttery and tender overall. Good size overall. 

16 oz Ribeye - tender, but I have to say we make better ribeye at home. If you come here, get something you don't normally cook for yourself. Like the filet. 

Mushroom - butter soup. I think that sums it up. 

Calamari - great flavor, but I wish I had known that it was in a glaze. It almost tasted like a sweet & sour calamari. Perhaps the menu said something about the glaze, but I didn't fully read it. I probably should have. 

Garlic mashed potatoes - very buttery. Can't say it was super delicious. 

Overall, it was a fun experience because we were in Vegas. Would I come here again? Maybe. But definitely order something different."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris in Vegas reminds me of incredible steaks and expensive dinners being paid by the corporate credit card. The steaks  are always perfectly cooked and dining here is one of those things you look forward to when you have to go to Vegas for work and not vacation."}
{"text":"perfection. It is where the bar has been set. I dare someone to knock this place off, bring it. And if they do.. I will TOTALLY eat there too haha. The wine selection is great, filet mignon oscar style was great! It was even good the next day since I could not eat it all the 1st time. I want to go back there like yesterday, it's just hard trying to find a friend will to drop a bill or 2 just on their meal to come with me."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am beyond impressed. With the taste of the food mostly, but the restaurant itself is very nice as well. 
Their filets are perfect and typically cooked perfectly.
If you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary it is nice place to have dinner. The service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to its name! From the drinks to the food to the service, everything was superb. I went for restaurant week and the server didn't treat me any differently, like other places would. The ahi tuna appetizer was delicious, the creamed spinach with my steak was fabulous and both drinks I tried, the ruby red grapefruit & coconut lemon drop, were excellent! I can't say enough good things about my experience. I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Nice Little Spot For A Quiet Dinner 

I ordered the 16 Ounce Ribeye with the Lyonnaise Fingerling Potatoes and Clam Chowder.  

4 out of 5! The 16 Ounce Ribeye was cooked medium per my request and was a good steak... prepared well and just the right amount of marveling. It did not blow my mind in the simple butter sauce but it was a good steak. Some creative  addition of some unique mysterious goodness usually can get the 5th star from me...

4 out of 5! Lyonnaise Potatoes were a surprisingly good presentation of a wedge French fry covered in caramelized onions... they were quite good.

5 out of 5! The Clam Chowder was surprisingly delectable and was superior to all others I had tasted before! 

4 out of 5! For dessert I had the Chocolate Lava Cake With Chocolate Mousse. The cake was extremely well made and presented splendidly. I would have only preferred the cake be slightly larger in size as it was delicious but suddenly it was all gone...

3 out of 5 stars... Service from the waitress... she was nominally friendly for a moment but didn't seem to be having a good night. When I wanted more coffee if was not an easy task. I think she didn't mean any wrong but she definitely wasn't in her game... I asked her to leave the coffee pot for me if it was easier and she just took it and left... someone expecting a $20-$40 tip on a $150-$200 meal should be providing service commensurate with that expectation...."}
{"text":"We did not have reservations as it was a last minute decision,  so we dined at the bar, and bar tender, Ron, went beyond the call of duty to be sure our experience was pleasurable.

We ended up sharing a seafood tower which was loaded with exquisite shell fish including huge lobster claws, Alaskan King Crab, and Prawns. Everything was delicious including the cheesecake desert we finished off the dinner with.

We know Ruth Chris is best known as a steakhouse, but this was quality food and service for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came here for our 1st wedding anniversary and it was delicious had a great waitress So Yun. Manager Estrella was very nice when greeting us at the table. Explained to us this spot opened in February. We enjoyed it very much"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday evening for a special ocassion. The servers and staff were great. I had recently tried Flemings in Charlotte and decided to give RC a try. I must say the RC was the better of the two. The price was about the same but I recieved more food for the money at RC. I ordered the T-Bone and was very satified with the taste and flavor of the steak. I also order a side baked potatoe and it was also done very well. My girlfriend order Filet cooked 3 different ways and she too was very happy with her meal. I would return in the future as this was a great meal and experience out."}
{"text":"I' ve ate here a couple of times and after trying another steak house close by I'm  gonna have to pass this up from now on!!  Oh by the way, the other steak house was Morton's."}
{"text":"Ruth's is very consistent. The corn fed beef is sweet and different from the steaks you'll get elsewhere in Calgary. We like it a lot. The service is always attentive but not intrusuve. We miss Adrian and hope he gets well soon!"}
{"text":"We ate in the bar/lounge on a Friday at 10pm. Very accommodating. Fantastic view of the strip. Excellent food. Cesar was charming and very professional."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto back in October and took my clients there two nights in a row.  That should pretty much say it all. The only problem is that I just don't get why everything costs so much.  I know Ontario province has some strange law about steaks must be fully cooked, but it does not apply to imported beef.  So I was able to order my ribeye in that beautifully pink medium rare.  But holy \"cow\", my two dinner tabs came to $1,100 for 3 people the first night and 4 the next!!  No wonder these Ruth's Chris are everywhere."}
{"text":"Food and customer service is Amazing !! Nice clean atmosphere. Our waiter was very diligent and very friendly . I ordered the stuffed chicken Omgahhh it was amazing ! My boyfriend ordered the salmon and it too was the best I ever had . We ordered a side of mash potatoes, although it didnt have much taste , they worked well for left overs. A little bit of butter and seasoning they were fine ! Will be returning back !"}
{"text":"Exceptional visit, never disappointed. Food is always prepared properly and have never had a complaint."}
{"text":"Never been to a RC I didn't like . Love this location . Been a few times in the past year. Wait staff has always been excellent and food as expected . It's a nice newer location which makes the ambiance nice ."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Ruth's Chris since around 1997 or 98.  When I got to Calgary tonight, I was very tired after working all night and traveling most of today.  I didn't want to venture out far tonight, so I broke one of my cardinal rules about eating at places I can eat at home.  But i am glad I did.  I got there about 9:30pm, so there weren't many people in the restaurant.  My server was outstanding at explaining the menu, the specials and was very friendly.  He took my order and it seemed like in less than five minutes I got my order.  I had the petite filet mignon (which was 8 oz), more than enough.  And I had the Spinach Au Gratin, which is just creamed spinach with a blend of three cheeses.  The meal was very, very good.  If you want a perfectly cooked steak, this is definitely the place to go.  It comes out sizzling and it is melt-in-your-mouth terrific.  The spinach was good too, but i think was on cheese overload.  I'll stick to the regular spinach or creamed spinach (no cheese) next time.  Because they also serve this incredible cheesy bread.  And as good as their dessert menu looked, it wasn't happening.  I was full.  I liked this place so much, I may go back tomorrow night!  Really, really great."}
{"text":"I took my son for Arizona Restaurant Week, wow amazing value for only $30! Top notch service & the best filet mignon in the world. Creamed spinach is a must, and for dessert Ruth's famous bread pudding. A+++"}
{"text":"First, we asked for quiet table - so we could talk to each other - and they delivered. For that - I am grateful as it made the dinner (five of us) so much better. We enjoyed the conversation! 

Second, the food was perfect. 

Third, the service was perfect. 

I'm a huge fan of this location."}
{"text":"Any-licious event at Ruth's Chris is worth your while. Amazing 6oz steak grilled to perfection with your choice of side. Pssst, get the mushrooms - trust me, man. Plus, polish off the meal with dessert choices between decadent chocolate cake, refreshingly tangy key lime pie, or classic blueberry cheesecake. 10/10 would return."}
{"text":"Best legacy steakhouse in the states! Visited the Scottsdale location for the first time after moving out of the area to Prescott and it was as perfect an experience as it was when I started going to the Camelback location 30 years ago. Trevor, the manager, was all over the restaurant, yet unobtrusive, making sure all was perfect. Consistently excellent throughout the locations!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day on fire!!!!!! The husband took me here for the first time for a steak of a lifetime!!! All he has every done is rave about this place!! Well......... He was right!! It was AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!! Enough said, go get your steak on!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'."}
{"text":"It isn't surprising that this was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten.  I still felt it in my belley at 4am when I woke up stuffed!

Service is great, they treat you like kings there.  It is very pricey of course.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the lack of character in the place.  I realize if you are going to Ruth's Chris, you're probably not going for character, but in my opinion you can do better than this...hey, why not use yelp to find a spot...;)

None-the-less, a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, really good steak and the best sweet potato casserole you could ever imagine."}
{"text":"I brought my fiance here as a graduation present. I'm vegetarian, so he busted out laughing when I emphatically said, \"This is the BEST broccoli I've ever had!\" It honestly was, though (Broccoli au Gratin). The cheese was perfectly crunchy-chewy around the sides, and creamy underneath. Despite it being fresh out of the oven (and therefore burning hot), it was gone in the first 5 minutes and I'd kill to have it again. Green beans and mashed potatoes were beyond perfect as well, and my fiance seemed infatuated with his filet. It was brought out a little less than medium at first, but the sizzling plate finished that job as he continued eating. At the end of the night, they sent us off with the complimentary chocolate cheesecake. I ate it the next day- it was deeeeelish!

Dom was our server for the night and he was everything a restaurant waiter should be- visible and accommodating, but not overbearing. He was professional, he came up at the right times without being obnoxious, and whenever our conversation paused, I noticed that he was always nearby and he would have been easily accessible if we ever had ever found that we needed his attention (even though we didn't). 

It was a great night out and I'd love to do it again. But of course, don't go if you're not willing to spend some money. It was over $80 (before a tip) for two glasses of wine, a vegetable plate and the filet. But it was WELL worth it. I may have to steal their recipe for the Broccoli au Gratin. Meat-eaters laugh all you want, but it rocked my socks off!"}
{"text":"I liked Ruth's Chris better than the Keg. Everything was delicious and, as it's an American chain, HUGE! Seriously. The side of onion rings would have served 8 people! Each onion ring was bigger than my face! They were good though.

I have to confess, I didn't eat anything healthy. I went with a friend who happens to be a client (so I could expense!) and we ordered steaks, potatoes and onion rings. Yum!

The steak was amazing. I got a ribeye and it was cooked perfectly medium rare and just melted in my mouth. Seriously. I have no complaints about salt, pepper, parsley and butter. If the steak is good quality, it shouldn't need extraneous seasoning. In fact, I would be suspicious if they put a lot of spice on it, like they were trying to hide something. For those who don't know, that's why curries and other spices came into being: to treat almost off cuts of meat. Trust me, don't need spices on the steaks from Ruth's Chris.

The hostess, two waiters and manager were all solicitious and nice. We never had to find or flag anyone down. As it should be, but as it rarely is when eating out in Toronto. Also, I only ate half my steak and we only ate half the onion rings (SURPRISE!) so they packed those up in nice little branded bags with napkins and forks and were very nice about that too! You don't want to let good food like this go to waste!

Note: The menu is HUGE (just like the portions). Apparently they were founded in New Orleans (there's a whole story on the menu which I didn't bother to read) so there's a lot of cajun options and tons of seafood. I stick with the steak, and am glad I did!
Also, this place, like most steakhouses, is not cheap. Go for a splurge or with an expense account."}
{"text":"Nice Chicago Style Steak 
I like The butter on side remember that Old school Chicago steak restaurant likes butter :) 
\"Al.Capone loved it ....
Good service specially by the bar ..."}
{"text":"Amazing! My boyfriend and I each ordered a piece of steak, and two sides to share. It was way more than enough! Loved the atmosphere & the \"secret\" elevator that takes you to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food as always! Environment is not as elegant as other Ruth's Chris around the country. Service was good, but would not come back here next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! I have never had a steak that good. The ahi tuna was great. They even brought me out a piece birthday cake I wasnt expecting. The staff was very friendly and went the extra mile. I had a great time."}
{"text":"I don't think I have the words to describe how amazing this place is. 

We came in to celebrate our 2nd anniversary & let me tell you our waiter Davonte knows how to help a couple have a good time! He was informative, patient & full of personality! He even took a few photos for us that evening & then printed them out for us to take home & enjoy! Can't say enough good things! 

As for the meal....PHENOMENAL. The blue lump crab cakes were cooked & seasoned to perfection. We had the petite filet and the ribeye with the dipping trio for the steaks (little random fact - they only use butter, salt & pepper to cook them - believe me you'd never guess) and every bite was like heaven in my mouth. The taste, the texture...they didn't miss a beat. If you want to know what ecstasy tastes like come here!! 
For dessert we did the chocolate lava cake & the white chocolate bread pudding & at this point I think I just died and went to heaven. I could eat the white chocolate bread pudding for days it's so light and delicious. And the lava cake....rich and decadent! All I can say is if this was my last meal I'd die a happy woman! Please check it out if you enjoy a great meal and an amazing dining experience! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit here after hearing about how they have the best steaks. I have to say I was very disappointed with the food and the service was just ok.

The views from the 2nd floor are very nice. You can also tell the place is having a few cosmetic issues inside as well as outside. The patio furnishings are not very comfortable and after sitting there for over 2 hours I had the worst lower back pain I've ever had! I had to cut the evening short because of it. 

Back to the food. I ordered the Mozzarella &Heirloom Tomato Salad which was very good. The Barbecued Shrimp on a bed of mashed potatoes was disappointing because I had no idea it was so \"soupy\". I had to eat it with a spoon  (did I miss something when I ordered it? )

I had a few bites of my boyfriends steak and it was bland,  absolutely no taste at all. Granted they only season their steaks with salt and pepper but come on, I make a better tasting steak at home.

All in all its a little too pricey for bland food."}
{"text":"If you have the money, it's soooo worth the $$.  Service was A+. Bread was great. Ordered the petite filet and hubby had the cowboy rib-eye. Both were out of this world. We shared the lobster Mac and cheese (excited to have that leftovers for lunch), and French fries. I actually prefer a la cart steak houses and this is a top notch choice. The vibe didn't even feel pretentious, which means that we will be back! Wish we had left over steak, but that didn't happen."}
{"text":"Honestly I've had ruth chris in the past on the east coast and it was nothing spectacular to me. I tried the one in LV and it might've been the best meal I've had it Vegas. We had a seafood tower and we split a ribeye steak. It was delicious but also very pricey. I dont think we should be paying $300 dollars for an appetizer, 1 steak and 3 drinks."}
{"text":"We visited Ruth's Chris on a Saturday night at 8:00 p.m., and we should've known something was up when the place was half empty.  We had a drink at the bar first; the bartender was nice but seemed a little overwhelmed and slow.  Once we were seated, we waited forever for our server to come over.  We were just about to get up and leave when he finally appeared.  He then introduced himself and wanted to shake my fella's hand, which seemed odd especially considering we were about to eat.  

We decided to fire it up a little and ordered a $100 half bottle of wine.  The sommelier came over to open it, which was nice, but he said he got some cork in the bottle while he was opening it.  He then came back with an already decanted bottle of wine.  Now, we're no fancy pants wine tasters, and we have no idea if he indeed opened a new bottle of the same wine or just brought us some leftover Franzia.  We ordered the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was good, and the petite filets for dinner, which were also good.  

This is the third time we've been in probably six months, and each time we keep hoping the service will get better, but no luck."}
{"text":"After a few crummy experiences at the SouthPark location, we decided to give Uptown a try, and I'm so glad we did.  We arrived an hour before our dinner reservation to have a drink at the bar.  The drinks were great, and the bartenders were super friendly and engaging.  

Dinner was perfect.  Our waiter, Chris, was funny, awesome and had great recommendations.  We got the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was fine, but there's only so much you can do with shrimp.  We also got the calamari and devoured it - some of the best in Charlotte.  Fella got the filet with scallops for dinner, and I got the filet tournedos (three 4 oz filets; one with blue cheese, one with crab meat and one with shrimp).  I love that the plates are sizzling hot when they come out!

We definitely left fat and happy, and I'm happy the uptown location restored my faith in Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Best. Effing. Dinner. Ever. In. My. Life.   Steak is so tender, sides were divine. If I have to file bankruptcy for this meal I do not care."}
{"text":"This was one of the BEST meals I've ever had!! My BF and I bought a travelzoo voucher for our anniversary and it was well worth the money and then some! We got a bottle of wine, two steaks, an appetizer,  a shared side and dessert and everything was amazing!! And the service was impeccable! Tom was our server and he was great. The best part was the chocolate soufflé cake!! Hands down the best dessert I've ever had!!  Hopefully we can continue coming back here each Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"We came to Ruth Chris to celebrate the birthday of a close friend.  The proportions of the sides were enough to feed two people.  The steak melt in my mouth like butter and was very flavorful.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the creamy spinach and lobster mac and cheese was so awesome.  Our server, Molly, was so patient and knowledgeable regarding the ingredients as well as drink options.  She was very prompt and touched based with us several times.  Rob and Matt assisted at times as well with bringing out different condiments and our entrees  and we really had some great laughs.  Ken was so sweet and welcomed our party of 9 as we entered and he really helped to make the celebration a success.  We will be dining here frequently.  Everything from valet to the servers and the food was a great experience."}
{"text":"Visited for Charlotte restaurant week and the food was fantastic. Service was great and very formal. Certainly would go again."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris really knows how to make an amazing steak!!! I did also quite enjoy the spinach dip as their side dish and their bread is simply amazing.. lots of people were also there for their regular menu.. the evening was fully booked.. A couple walked in trying to get a table but were told nothing was free until 9:45 pm! (and it was 6:30pm) 
 
I felt my steak was a little bit overcooked *maybe cuz my steak was smaller* so ended up with medium well instead of medium rare.. but other than that..it was ok Appetizer and dessert: nothing too special.. At regular price, you will get the 6 oz small steak for $45 only so I think it is worth it to go for summerlicious and winterlicious... though i wished they could improve on their appertizers offering...also liked the service too..the bread that comes with the food..  very good.. 

Plus bonus: they have round tables too for big groups..  also, if you are ordering your steak well done, make sure to ask for the option of  butterflying your steak"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat.  We had our Christmas party here. Staff and atmosphere were great. Only issue was I ordered the filet and shrimp, but received the filet and lobster. The waiter seemed to argue with me about it. I finally said thsts fine I'll eat it. It was delicious just not what I ordered."}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday night around 5:30pm 
Didn't make a reservation this time but was still seated immediately. 

We had a flight to catch so we knew coming here we could eat a fresh perfectly cooked meal and be on time. 

We both had the stuffed chicken I must say it is one of the best selections on the menu besides the filet mignon also one of my faves !

I paired mind with the mashed potatoes and asparagus everything cooked great the chicken was so moist and succulent plus came out sizzling. My pairings were seasoned nicely. 

You can never go wrong when coming to Ruth's Chris!! This location is by far my favorite! 

Last but not least My server was absolutely amazing as always she was friendly, attentive and made sure we were out of there by the time that I had planned. If you have never been Here this is the place to come!

Wether you are local, visiting or headed to the airport and want a great meal. No place is better"}
{"text":"I usually love Ruths Chris, but this particular location was pretty ghetto.  It's in the center of a strip mall next to a Subway.  It's not what I expected.  The food was consistently good as always like all the other Ruths Chris locations I've been to."}
{"text":"I really like the steak but feel that the food may be slightly overpriced. My usual is a small filet mignon with asparagus... Plus some sparkling water. This will usually cost over 70$ with tax and tip.... But still delicious."}
{"text":"Finally made a reservation for four at Ruth's Chris. Tuan provided great (and patient!) service. Decor is classic and thoughtful and this location does not have the downtown buzz (which was fine by us.) Overall ambience is kinda dark tho. 
Now, on to the food: the calamari was salty; swordfish - underwhelming; stuffed chicken breast was likely the best protein at our table; salmon (centre undercooked); filet and shrimp (asked for medium well, thinking the plate would finish cooking it, but I got medium instead!) 
Mac n cheese, soup, and salads weren't bad. However the turtle cheesecake had fridge burn and none of us could eat it - it tasted like it had been left in the fridge unwrapped and had absorbed allllll the varied fridge smells (so disappointing because I loooooove cheesecake!) 
Total bill came to $400 - meh; we expected that, even though I don't think the food quality was worth it.  I found it odd that an 18% gratuity was included on our bill - I thought that was a customary practice for larger groups only and found it to be rather presumptuous.
To be honest and frank, I didn't expect the corner cutting on the classics desert (it's old food, people, please throw it away) from a place with such a high reputation for excellence.  That was a huge disappointment. I enjoyed splurging on an evening at the Keg much more than I did this evening. We'll likely just go there next time."}
{"text":"This is the Ruth's Chris steak house I most often visit.  The location is perfect...easy to find and park.  The staff is great and the food is absolutely the BEST.  I usually dine at the bar due to the convenience, servers, and the live music they occasionally feature.  The TV screens are a perfect compliment when a sports event is being aired.  The patrons are always friendly and professional.  I've met many interesting people at this restaurant.  

Now, as far as food, I recommend the crab cakes as a starter.  They are delicious!  Every plate which comes from the kitchen arrives being 500 degrees hot.  The steak of choice is the Filet Mignon prepared medium.  The scent of the sizzling hot butter and steak on the plate is a distinct pleasurable feature.  I look forward to my return."}
{"text":"Steak is flavourful. Cheesecake is great! More specifically, their filet mignon is seasoned just right - medium. No complaints."}
{"text":"This night's dinner puts Ruth Chris back on top for my favorite chain steakhouse. Superior service by our waiter largely contributed to this.

Cost to worth it rating: 3 (standard steak prices)

Highlights:
- Ruth's classics: set menu for $40 for choice of entrée (6oz filet and shrimp was one), salad or gumbo, personal sized side, and small dessert. Filet itself is mid-30's, so excellent deal.
- Waiter: We got a certified pro here. Sean not only far surpassed my expectations for a place like this, but was fit to work at any highly rated fine dining establishment. He topped our experience at many a places like this (most recently Charlie Trotter's) by doing the secret waiter hyper observant eavesdropping thing as a tool to anticipate our tastes and needs. After minutes at the table, he already deduced we were wine fans and on his own initiative delved into giving us a taste of one of his new favorites that was coincidentally already one of ours too. Immediately we knew this guy will be cool. He was gymnast-level flexible accommodating modifications to the set menu (swapping out sides, giving blue cheese crumbles, doubling up on mousse for the non-berry lovers, etc.), telling us whatever the question, the answer would be yes--the level of service I'm always hoping for. Also chummy friendly sharing info about how many kids he had and talking iPhone apps with me when I pulled out my phone. And this treatment just wasn't for us--I saw him doing the same for all of his tables near us.
- Wine: pretty good choices across price ranges and with the help of Sean we ended up with a great one. He shared one of his preferred wines we weren't aware of, saying if we didn't smile after a taste, we could choose something else. Of course we were happy with that Shiraz. When ordering sparkling, he wisely let us know they had a muscato di asti which the hub loves after his 6 month living stint in Italy.
- Filet: cooked perfectly and served on a sizzling hot plate of butter which doubled as presentation flair and sears in flavor. I'm picky about my steaks and this fit the bill. The shrimp were nicely intertwined together and placed on top of the steak.
- Dessert: mini berries and cream and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell. Perfectly small proportions after a hearty meal like we had.

Lowlights:
- I've patronized many a Ruth Chris over the years and even though their steaks are relatively consistent, their service has never been this good. Thanks Sean for that and tell your wife you're doing great, but now the bar us set high for my return visits and I doubt they'll live up to this. 

Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be back if not to this location another one for sure. Thanks Sean to making it such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Don't believe anyone who rates this establishment under a 4 star review. My husband and I have been going here for anniversaries/special occasions since we have been married (in 2008), and every experience has been amazing. It really is the best food I have ever eaten. We both start with the Caesar salads which include the most delicious croutons and shaved Parmesan ever. My husband always orders a ribeye which is perfect and I get the stuffed chicken breast with lemon butter and garlic herb cheese. AMAZING. The huge sides are always delicious as well. Our favorites include the potatoes au gratin, shoestring fries, and green beans or garlic mashed potatoes. For dessert you can't go wrong with their homemade cheesecake and chocolate almond bark. We always look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"For the reviewer who said NYE was a bad time for a first visit - I should have listened.  They were running almost an hour behind on reservations and when we finally got to the table; it was another 5-10 minutes to get water and a bread basket. I understand this day is hectic, but after several years in business you'd think they would not overbook & would have it figured out. In all - we were understanding of the wait and tried some delicious drinks to pass the time in the bar area. We didn't have anywhere to be afterward, but a lot of people were angry they were missing parties, etc. as dinners took almost 2 hours on average once seated. 

The food was very good; although my filet was more rare than medium. I didn't even consider sending it back as they were still crazy busy at 10:30pm when we finally got our entrees, although I probably should have. Wedge salad was great as was the French onion soup. Also enjoyed the french fries (seasoned to perfection) and asparagus sides. 

All in all a good restaurant, but if I am paying $200 for a dinner for 2 people I think it's understandable to expect a certain level of service - no matter what day of the year! While our waiter was nice, he was clearly overworked and had a hard time keeping up with his tables. Our water glass was refilled once; it took 10 minutes to even get any bread or water, and all of our food was delivered by other staff than him. When he was at our table, he spoke at about a million miles an hour & always seemed rushed. I don't think this was his fault, but it was definitely not service that's acceptable at a restaurant this expensive. 

We will probably not go back. For the price; we enjoyed Fleming's more (ambiance & food) or will stick to local joints like Tornado or Wunder Bar."}
{"text":"I treated my boyfriend to the Prisoner Wine Company dinner last week for his birthday. The first wine dinner he had ever been to! The wine, abeyance , presentation, staff and even our table mates were FANTASTIC! A++ job!
 The 1st and 2nd course were amazing- honestly I was very surprised how much we enjoyed the falafel & roasted pumpkin!  However the 3rd and 4th courses were not what we have come to expect from Ruth Chris- anywhere but especially in South Park. The Braised Short ribs in form of a meatball were bland and disappointing. But the most disappointing was the fatty filet that was served raw. While I like my steak medium rare my boyfriend likes his rare- and ours was just raw. We both took ours to go and cooked them at home. 
 
I have dined at Ruth Chris all over the country and am very proud of the South Park location and believe it to be the best- I write this review not to complain or put down the establishment but just to raise a red flag to the Ruth Chris Team that the dinner was subpar at best and certainly not what we have come to expect from the Ruth Chris South Park. 

I had written to the sales and marketing manager who responded it was a corporate driven menu and someone would be in touch with me- the dinner was over a month ago and no one reached out and I have yet to receive the bottle of wine we purchased."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of Ruth Chris Steak Houses and for this location I think it rocks.  Loved the large windows that overlook the strip/las vegas blvd. 

If you don't like BUTTER then don't dine here.  The steak is served on a 500 degree hot plate with butter.  Since I dine at a lot of different locations, my go to are: 

Harvest Salad
BBQ Shrimp
Seared Ahi Tuna
Rib Eye Steak
Lobster Tail
And a handful of sides

Came here on Thanksgiving Day 11/24/16.  Our server was very nice and took care of us very well.  

The ambiance is beautiful, the company was the best and the view was amazing."}
{"text":"Let's get down to the chase - Ruth Chris Toronto is right on the money when it comes to a well cooked and seasoned steaks. We both ordered the prime rib steaks and we found the steaks to be very flavorful, juicy and cooked correctly. The sides are also very well made - we ordered the asparagus and potatoes with cheese (forgot the name) - both go extremely well with the steak. 

Some slight letdowns with this place - we found the service could be somewhat improved and more attentive. Although the service is prompt, we felt it was a little cold and not as personalized as I would have felt at other steak houses at this price level.

Overall - Ruth Chris delivers the goods which is the main reason why we all went there. It remains to be one of the top restaurants in the city that serves very good steaks."}
{"text":"Last time I was there It for my birthday.  I ordered the lobster, it was awful and I usually order the filet but I wanted something different.  I don't plan on going back here.  There are many other steak houses."}
{"text":"Phenomenal steak and food. Everything from the steak to the asparagus was cooked perfectly. Ambiance was classy and peaceful and did not distract from the food or from the table. Though on the pricey side if you're looking for a place to have a great steak or sea food and an enjoyable evening I would recommend this place 100%. And seriously don't skip dessert. I didn't even know it was possible for cheesecake to taste that good."}
{"text":"We went here on our last night in Toronto after deciding not to do dinner in the CN Tower.  Best decision ever!!  The hostess was very polite and seated us right away.  Our waiter (Malcolm) was gracious and explained how the menu works and what the specials were.  I ordered the Ribeye and my friend ordered the filet.  We also ordered some sides and dessert as well, but honestly, it was all about the steak. It comes sizzling on a hot plate and was cooked to perfection.  Honestly, it was the best steak I have ever had.  Overall it was a great meal and I'm totally looking forward to visiting the location near me."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for a while now and decided to take the family there. Very pleasant location, have to take the elevator or go up the stairs which is fine. We had a great table and 4 ladies next to us were drinking either pink martinis or cosmos through the night and making a racket. 
Everyone ate steaks so we have an idea about their steaks. We also all had salads and deserts. I had the menu fix which can with a smaller wedge salad and desert. The steaks came with nothing- on a tiny platter barely large enough for the streak- had to get the side for $$$ more.

{"text":"Went for their late night happy hour (from 11pm to close). It was awesome...their bar menu was half off as well as their private label wine (which wasn't bad at all). Nate, the bartender, was fun and engaging. We didn't have lots of time to talk since he was busy but his service was wonderful. I had the 4 oz filet oscar and my man had the steak brushetta...both delightful. Will be back again for late night fun."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary, the entire staff serving us was very attentive and responsive. Skyler and Austin went above and beyond to get us complimentary dessert and delicious drinks. 
Our porterhouse was mouthwatering. You don't even have to chew that hard, it just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've never been to this restaurant before so I didn't know quite what to expect. As far as steak houses go, I've tried a couple and this one beats all the other's I've been to! From the outside, the restaurant doesn't seem like much because it's upstairs and tucked in a corner of a plaza but when you arrive, your greeted with smiling employees ready to open the door for you. 

The young hostess up front was beautiful and very friendly. We had reservations on a Saturday night and had to wait to be seated which is understandable- although the restaurant didn't seem that full.

Upon being seated, our waiter (Ben) was very attentive to our needs and did a fantastic job! He deserves a raise. He was kind enough to tell me a little bit about the restaurant and their food and even advised we cover ourselves with a napkin when the steaks are served to avoid getting butter splashed on us from the heat of 500 degree plates (insane). 

Now to review the steak; for $56 I ordered the T-bone. Yes, that's what they charged for one steak. All appetizers are separate unless you order the 3 course dinner. I contemplated ordering a smaller steak and perhaps a side but I thought to myself if this place is known for steaks, I need to go all out. It was the best steak I've ever had in my life! Salt, pepper, and parsley is all the seasoning they used to make the steak and it was perfect. Every bite gushed with melted butter and the texture was super smooth and tender. 

The people I was with ordered smaller steaks and sides and were nice enough to share. I tried their asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and cauliflower. All of the sides were delicious and I left feeling full and pleasantly surprised. 

Between the friendly staff, fantastic t-bone, and romantic atmosphere, this place deserves 5 stars from me. My only complaint is how expensive it is."}
{"text":"This is very good food and the Filet to die for ... But you probably will, when you pay your ticket. Ate there with the wife, and for two people al-a-carte, it ran us about or close too, $200 bucks. It was really good,like bomb. But so was the price of dinner. I could of bought a week's worth of groceries for the two of us. But it was time for a treat. So, I treated her or us. The service was great along with the food.The atmosphere was nice and cozy as well. Enjoyed our time and the good eats. Thx"}
{"text":"After years of hearing such great things about the legendary Ruth's Chris Steak house I had some expectations on both the service and the food. Sadly I was left disappointed by the quality of both.

When I walked into the restaurant, I was greeted by the manager and hostess. Once we were seated, our waiter came by and barely introduced himself and it felt like he was ignoring us the whole time. I know this maybe picky, but for a high class restaurant I had some expectation of small talk for him to get to know myself and my guest. When the food came, he didn't even bother to check on us. This left a bad taste in my mouth about the quality of customer service. It seemed as if, they knew that the menu items were already expensive and so they new regardless of the tip percentage it would still be a sizable amount.

The decor was dark and depressing. The was very dim, in a small space. The atmosphere wasn't all that welcoming. This might be because I'm not use to fine dining but overall the decor was nothing impressive.

Now to the food, for the price that you pay the food was really nothing special. Yes, the steaks and beef were cooked extremely well and the butter added on top just gave it so much more flavor. But what really hurts are the sides. At $12 a side, most of it was really mash potatoes and fries it is extremely overpriced for what you get. I had the Potato Lyonaise and that was just fried potatoes with onions that were over salted. My steak was cooked perfectly but there was nothing special about it. the highlight of my meal was the dessert, a rich dark chocolate mousse cake with espresso beans and a raspberry couli so good! But as a whole the meal was mediocre at best.

If you're looking to enjoy a good steak meal with the family, this place really isn't worth the money or the hype around it. It was cold and unwelcoming and the servers were just awful for the amount of money you're paying. If this place is on your bucket list by means try it but you can enjoy a good steak at either Zorros or the Keg for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Drove 200 miles to the Ruth's Chris Steak House closest our home. Wife's birthday and when we arrived we found little sparkly \"Happy Birthday\" cutouts on our table. Excellent Napa wine selection. Two of our party had specialty cocktails which they reported to be superior. Lobster Mac and cheese for unique starter: amazing!!! Steak and shrimp entrees: exquisite.  They real magic is in the preparation.  Steaks done perfectly but with a delectable seared exterior.  Hash browns can serve FOUR!! All in all, another memorable meal at Ruth's"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris is where we go if we want to spoil ourselves with a top quality steak: custom-aged USDA Prime Midwestern beef, to be exact.

AMBIANCE: 
We were greeted at the front desk where we checked in our coats, oriented to the location of the washrooms then introduced to our waiter by name. Dining room is decorated in lots of dark wood, white linen, and low lighting. Our booth was comfy cozy; we sat back and enjoyed listening to a mix of music from the big band era to lively jazz.  

SERVICE:
There were well dressed waiters in white shirts, vests and bow ties. Our waiter addressed us as Mr & Mrs Brandon and seemed genuinely interested in making sure our needs were fully met. Well versed on the menu, he gave us recommendations according to our tastes. Throughout dinner our waiter was pleasant and accommodated all our requests with a smile; later, management made rounds to each table to check on everyone. On the way out the coat check girl offered us a mint, then actually helped us put on our coats. 

FOOD:
- Warm complimentary bread was nice and crusty on the outside but soft on the inside, so good!
- Steaks were heralded by the sound of sizzling meat on a hot plate surrounded by melted butter (you can choose to omit the butter). Tender meat was seasoned with just salt and pepper, no need to mask it's taste with sauces or heavy spicing. Seared to perfection and allowed to properly rest: we didn't get a river of blood when we cut into it. Our steaks were tender, juicy and flavourful.
- You can't go wrong with either their creamed spinach or their creamy (garlic) mashed potatoes; portions are large enough to share. Their Caesar salad was just ok. 
- Don't forget to mention if you're celebrating a special occasion. You'll be rewarded with their complimentary, rich and decadent, Chocolate Sin Cake. It had the taste and texture of a chocolate truffle, a perfect pairing with their refillable dark roast coffee.

With top notch service, delicious food and wonderful ambiance, it's definitely a place to go to to impress your date or celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"My best bud and I had both earned our professional engineering status.  We needed a decent place to celebrate.  

We chose well!

Though the lighting could have been slightly dimmed, the restaurant was nice and we were sat near a fire place.  The service was perfect throughout.

And the food... ohh the food.  We ordered wine and apps... but this is what mattered:

We shared the $99 Porterhouse steak for two!

It was served sizzling and pre-cut into pieces.  Our plates were served hot and garnished with melted butter.  The steak was easily the best I'd ever tasted.  Hot, tender, flavourful.  Oh, no !  Where'd it go?

The meal created the perfect lasting memory of our achievement.

I would definitely return need I a guaranteed good experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding food but even better management. My family and I came in for the Happy Hour. The manager herself helped make our dining experience a special one. She made sure we left home happy and made my family feel great. Thank you and we can't wait to come back to your steak house."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is always good... and Expensive.

We ate the early bird special,  and had a single beer,  and it was 200 bucks for 2.  

I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Orlando, FL location. The food was just okay, not sure that I would return to this location."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Jeff, was spectacular! He gave us great recommendations, and he made sure we were satisfied with everything we ordered. The food was amazing, just like the view of the strip from our table. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris is a classic steakhouse, never disappoints. We had the crab, mango, avocado stack to start, it was so delicious, we ordered another one! I had the 16 oz ribeye which was flavorful and tender.  We also ordered the Lamb chops, Shrimp Scampi, which was excellent and lobster Mac n Cheese, which was okay but excepted more from RC."}
{"text":"Had the New York steak it was amazing. 12oz cost 65 dollars with no sides. Pricey but exceptional quality. Service was ok, nothing special but Paul our server was very knowledgable about steaks."}
{"text":"Best steak Iv had hands down! The plate is heated so the steak is hot from your first bit to your last. 

The best appetizers to get are the Ahi Seared Tuna and potato skins. The other apps we received were mushrooms, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and corn all of which didn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Food and drink are great.  Service is always really slow for happy hour."}
{"text":"My day of beef was just completed.  It started with Sarinana's Tamales and Eggs for breakfast.

Lunch was Portillo's for a dog and a beef dip sammy.

Dinner was filet mignon at Ruth's Chris.  4.5 stars.

Greeted by a cheerful staff, we were sat at a big table in the center of the room.  This place is known for wonderful service and were not disappointed.  One guy for bread and water, another for cocktails, another two for the wine.  A truly professional staff dedicated to a wonderful dining experience.

Blue cheese olives in a dirty Ketel One martini. Blue cheese wedge salad.  Not remarkable, but very good. The petite fillet was perfectly done.  Pink through and through, not raw in the middle.  Medium was the right call.  Lots of haters out there who dislike the butter finish but it was really good.  The Gulf shrimp side portion was a great call, too. Nicely seasoned, not overpowering.

Banana cream pie, nicely carmelized, and a delicious bread pudding were passed around the table.

The entire evening was wonderful, but when it comes to a top of the line steakhouse, I want perfection, hence the 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had a top sirloin steak today with mushroom and potatoes and the meal was great. Personally, I am not a big fan of letting the steak soak in butter, but the sizzle sounds nice when the steak gets there. 
It's a decent steak house and I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, could our dinner have been any better?  I don't see how.  We received a $25 gift card and purchased an additional card at a discount to finally try this upscale restaurant.  From the moment we walked in we were treated like very special guests.  The service was perfect and  Colleen was the most delightful and attentive server.  I began with the largest wedge salad I've ever had, then came our steaks, of course cooked to perfection.  I had a med rare petite filet and hubby had the highly recommended rib-eye.  We knew we wouldn't need any more sides, but ordered a mashed potato plate.  A delicious glass of wine and a chocolate dessert later, we were both very happy, content and pleasantly full."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  The service and food are great.  What more could you ask for in a restaurant on the Vegas Strip!?  Just don't be too hungry when they bring you the steak because it's literally broiling hot!"}
{"text":"I would like to recognize Ruth Chris especially at Harrahs Las Vegas! Their food is always the best and they have a awesome happy hour!! Ron the bartender makes amazing drinks! Definitely order the filet, ceasar salad, scallop mash potatoes!!!The customer service is excellent! I have been there so many times I can't even count! I have been twice on my birthday The manager Estrella is truly amazing! She is always friendly and extremely helpful and went above and beyond for me!  Last time I had ordered a birthday cake delivered to the hotel and it wasn't delivered to the restaurant she went all over the hotel to find it!! Thank you!! Also I just had a party there for my birthday which is a perfect place to have a party! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful!  There is a strip view :)  the servers dolly and ceasar were so efficient, friendly and overall wonderful during my party! They brought the food out in a timely manner and also made sure everyone was good on drink orders!! Good job keeping up with all of us!! Y'all rock!!! Love Andrea"}
{"text":"What comes standard with any Ruth's Chris is superb food and equally superb service. 
William, our server was wonderful."}
{"text":"Awfull,  not really a good food and respect here.  Our private table was cold. We asked to change the Waiter claim everywhere is the same and not caring about our feeling.  Plus they thos piece of salmon without any floral or side and charged us 70 $ .stay away from this name."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse I have ever gone to so far. Dollianne, our waiter was amazing!!! She gave us an amazing background of the place, they have the top 2% best meat in the United States. The drinks are amazing hand crafted and made from scratch. The atmosphere is perfect for a nice quote but friendly meet up. AGAIN, The steak was AMAZING!!!!! && our waiter was great."}
{"text":"Always our favorite. Special occasion was for my lovely Wife's Birthday.  We brought our 3 kiddos for the first time and it was fantastic. Our Server was very accommodating and we found out that Ruth's actually has a KIDS MENU!! Great value for the filet and sides for kids!!! My usual Lobster Bisque, Large Filet (Med Rare) and sides of Sweet Potato Casserole, Creamed Spinach were all perfect.  Tried the suggested Lobster Mac & Cheese and that was average."}
{"text":"As usual, perfect. Our Hendersonville Videographer award winner was treated by his co-workers to lunch here. Despite arriving without reservations, our group was accommodated without apparent effort. Service was all-pro and our steaks just absolutely terrific.  Big tab for street grunts, but worth every dime."}
{"text":"When I arrived at this location I was excited about the experience.  The valet was great, the receiving hostess was great and that's where it began to go down hill. I started with one waitress and was changed to another.  I asked a few questions since this was my first restaurant week as well.  I placed my order for my starter, no problem here.  I did not receive the traditional bread that comes out with a meal, no explanation was given. I placed my order for the Lamb chop trio; I was advised a few minutes later you did not have the entree.  Correct me if I am wrong at the start of any business isn't it customary for the chief to inform the staff if the supply is depleted?  I ordered the second choice the lemon pepper chicken. I made sure to inform Jesse it was my first time participating in restaurant week.  The chicken and the mash potatoes as a side were great.  I ordered the dessert; again it was not the items listed on the menu.  Disappointed I ordered the substitute. When the dessert arrived I explained I did not eat the berries that garnished the top.  She told me she could bring me an additional cheesecake. I believe at this point Jesse assumed I would not be tipping so it was though I was bothering her.  I received my bill and provided the usual 20% tip, my personal standard preference.  Once she received the tip I noticed her attitude changed drastically. When I arrived home I noticed the dessert was the original one and someone simply removed the garnish of berries.  I am not sure why I received the second class citizen service; needless to say I am not pleased. Overall, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The food is over priced."}
{"text":"The steaks are tender but they are so soaked in butter that I felt I was eating a movie popcorn bucket.   Thes service was great, but the food just average."}
{"text":"Our server Darren was amazing! He just moved here and did a fantastic job, food was awesome as always. Never disappointed. Will be asking for Darren every time we come in!!"}
{"text":"I've had some serious eats... but Ruths Chris has definitely got the best pieces of meats I have ever had (so far).

Service - Slow to greet, but timing with food and drinks was perfect.

For starters we had the Berry Infused martini and the Luxurita. Both we're made with delicious top shelf liquors and freshly squeezed lime/lemon juice! Let me tell you... freshly squeezed makes a huge difference! These drinks were only a whopping 12-13 bucks, not bad at all... not to mention we each only had ONE to get us feeling good for the night :)

Appetizer - Spicy lobster, bits of lobster drenched in corn starch and lightly flash fried, dressed in a siracha-mayo sauce with a cumcumber salad. Delicious, we we're very appetized :) Loved the balance of hot and cool on this plate!

Spinach and Pear salad - This was awesome!! I'm not too sure what the vinagrette was but it was nice and tangy, the salad was topped off with goat cheese crumbles, walnuts, red onions, and dried cranberries. Definitely generous portions of pears in the salad :) Loved it.

Chorizo soup - Red tomatoey thick broth, tasty.

Dinner - Ribeye! Cooked to perfection at Medium Rare! Comes on a HOT sizzling plate with melted butter on the bottom, this was to die for...I've never had a rib eye literally melt in my mouth... cutting the steak was effort less I could have probably used just my fork if I tried. Sauteed mushrooms - whole mushroom caps, very tasty!  Mashed potatoes - just mashed potatoes. Added 6 pieces of shrimp with my steak, the shrimps we're nice and big! Worth the extra $12.

Dessert - Chocolate cake with fresh berries and sweet cream. Perfect balance and way to end the night!

If you are going to splurge, I suggest going to Ruths Chris, we had a great time and enjoyed the food very much.

IF YOU COME HERE... COME HUNGRY!!!"}
{"text":"After eating at the Ruth Chris in Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis and NYC, I decided to take my family out for dinner there one night. Well. I got the porterhouse for 2 and split it with my dad. The meat is unbelievable. This is one of the best chain steakhouses in the US and after seeing one in Toronto, I had to go there. The atmosphere is really dark and perfect. They have a nice wood siding along the walls that is really cool. My mom and my brother both got steaks while my grandmother got some fish. She doesn't eat meat anymore. But you go there for the steaks. My porterhouse was medium rare and was just beautiful to look at and to sink my teeth into. The meat melted the second it went into my mouth. They brought out the meat on a separate plate and gave my dad and I another hot plate with butter melted on it. They then took a slice of meat off and dipped it in the butter and swirled it around. It was amazing. 

Oh. If you're going with an even number of people, get the porterhouse for 2 and split it. You get more meat and it's a little bit cheaper. Not to mention better. Don't get two separate steaks for 2 people. Not worth it.

Anyways, I ordered some creamed spinach, asparagus and sauteed mushrooms as a side for everyone. The creamed spinach is not as good as the one from Peter Lugers but hey, you can't usually match something that good. 

I ordered 2 bottles of wine which helped run the tab up a little bit more. For desert, I got the creme brulee while my mom got some sort of chocolate cake. The total tab was close to $500 before tip but we had about 6 people eating and 2 bottles of wine. There were also appetizers thrown in there as well.

The service was impeccable. I love being waited on by people who know what they are doing and these guys knew what they were doing. They also know a lot about their meat which helped everything out as well."}
{"text":"Went here by myself on a whim while traveling on business. Nice touch is the complimentary valet parking at the curb. For all the hype, the food is passable. I would expect more when paying $39 for a steak. That's a loss of a star. Presentation was lacking... It came served by itself on a little white plate. The carafe holding the mashed potatoes was larger. Two small shrimp accompanied it. That's a loss of a 1/2 star. The service takes away another star. They were pleasant and personable enough, but there's no need for them to know my name...I probably won't be back there again. Also, too many servers/waitstaff were in the soup. One took my drink order. Another took my dinner order. Still another took my dessert order. The last guy didn't know that I ordered one of their specials that came with salad, dessert and entree and he tried to sell me another expensive dessert. That's my biggest gripe....Why does an upscale, expensive place like this constantly try to upsell you every time they come to the table? I don't need suggestions off the menu. If I wanted the additional lobster tail for $18, I'll order it myself. I don't want to order a more expensive dessert than what I wanted. I felt like they were holding me by the legs upside down until all of the money fell out of my pockets."}
{"text":"The steak was cooked to perfection, Our table attendant Ramon was exceptional, we celebrated three family birthdays and by all means it was worth every hundred."}
{"text":"I went to Ruth's Chris tonight for an early dinner with my BF and brother... we all did the Soma Triathlon earlier today, so needless to say. we'd each worked up quite the appetite!

Jared had been to this location but neither me or Zack had - we were actually really impressed!  We were all dressed casually and the hostesses didn't judge us.  We chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful night, and our team of waiters (Greg and John) took really good care of us.  We were drinking water like crazy and went through two bread baskets right off the bat.  The three of us split two bone in rib eye steaks and the signature tomato onion salad, steamed spinach, and sweet potato casserole... The waiters cut the salad and steaks up per our request.  As we were eating, the manager, Stacia, came to check on us which is always a nice touch!  We had nothing to complain about either - the steak was tender and delicious, the sides went well with it too.  

The meal before tip came to $135 but luckily we had a $50 off Amex coupon, so it wasn't too crazy expensive.  I would totally return to Ruth's Chris before some of the other Steak House chains any day."}
{"text":"So if you've been here and didn't like it then you're doing it wrong. Period. Good god this place is amazing! I am actually wondering how this place has slipped through my review typing fingers. Now granted every time I have been here I have always gotten the same thing, filet mashed potatoes and wedge salad, however I have always made room for food from others plates as well as dessert. If you're a steak lover this place should be your Mecca! The steaks come out perfectly cooked and still simmering on a plate with a little butter at something crazy like hundreds of degrees! The steak literally melts in your mouth and the sides... the SIDES. All of it is good you cannot go wrong mashed potatoes are my fav but the veggies are delish too from the creamed spinach to the broccoli. My guy got the double breasted chicken and it was wonderful but believe me people the steak is where it's at.

I came to the uptown location but have been to South Park as well there's valet in both locations so parking is easy if that's not your thing there's a lot in SP and street spots (if you can find one) uptown that's free on the weekends. This place is kinda fancy but I don't think a real firm dress code but don't quote me on it. Also it will make your life easier if you make a reso. But whatever you have to do definitely make sure you make this place somewhere you try at least once as it's to die for for any steak lover."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks served extra hot on a sizzling plate. Sides and appetizers are decadent and everything is chock full of great flavor.
The Cowboy Cut steak is enormous and simply the best steak I have ever had (several times now).
This place is where I splurge for celebrations, it's not cheap, but quality never is.
Our waitress the last 2 trips was incredibly intuitive in filling our needs.
If given the opportunity, this is my last meal..."}
{"text":"Excellent. The staff is attentive without being pushy. Julie, our waitress was amazing! The food came out hot and seasoned perfectly. We enjoyed steaks, lobster tails, appetizers and cocktails. My only criticism would be that the quality/variety of the side dishes was not quite as good as Red the Steakhouse. 

Beautiful decor!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that I've never had a better steak. It was buttery, melt is your mouth goodness, served on a hot plate so that every single bite was hot. Not such a big fan of the cream spinach though. I thought it was very bland in taste. I'd go there just for the cheesecake. It is dense but very light in taste with a coat of sour cream on top. I've been there twice and each time our service has been excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I think this place falls into the corporate steakhouse category, and fits it well.  Similar to Flemings (which I have visited 10+ times), I have enjoyed the happy hour here.  They are always accommodating and the food is what you would expect.  On point."}
{"text":"I went to this location early on a Saturday. Got the New York strip medium rare. It was flavorless and dry. I should have sent it back. I was truly shocked at how bad this $50 steak tasted. We got the lobster mac and cheese as a side. The lobster actually squeaked when I chewed it from being so over cooked. Not sure if they actually use a sauce or just melt some cheese over cooked pasta. I was really disappointed cause I've been to other locations and the food was fantastic. If I'd been with a group of people I knew better I would have spoken up."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris will forever be a favorite of mine! I always order the steak with Shrimp on top. This time we had the potatoes and spinach as our sides. It gets better every time! I ordered the creme brûlée for dessert, which is my favorite and it was delicious to say the least. Their customer service is always superb and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there earlier this year for our anniversary. A fancy fancy place, service and the atmosphere were all very nice, good for a special occasion. But steak? I had better!! The shining point of the whole dinner was the dessert. I thought All other food were just ok. Good experience thoguh."}
{"text":"Porterhouse for two is amazing! The Lovster mac n cheese is sub par IMO. Steak burger is to die for"}
{"text":"I work in uptown and there are many options for lunch. When I want a quick steak house meal, Ruth's Chris is my go-to option with their 30-minute Lunch for $15. The menu is small but makes it an easy fit for a busy schedule.

My favorite selection is the steak sandwich with bearnaise...minus the sandwich part. I believe that you keep it simple when it comes to eating steak, so I opt to have this dish served with just the sliced tenderloin filet, finished with the house-made bearnaise sauce. I've had the sandwich option the first time order but have made this customized request since, because I feel that the sandwich parts to steak ratio is unbalanced.

The sweet and sour salmon or the lobster bisque and caesar salad combo are both popular, lighter alternate choices on this lunch menu. In my opinion, the sweet and sour thai chili glaze is a bit too sweet, especially in the veggies that come with the salmon.

All of the sides I've had are all cooked simply and are delicious. The decor at Ruth's Chris is the least stuffy of all the steak houses in Charlotte and projects a clean and simple professional vibe.

Overall, the food and experience has been very consistent. Lastly, they offer a seafood gumbo soup that I love to order as an appetizer to satisfy my cravings for a Cajun creole cuisine taste."}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to Visit this restaurant for an event. This restaurant was not on my radar, I was excited to try their food and see what they were all about.

Out of all the offerings for the event, I  got to try their Ahi Tuna Poke, Beef Empanada, Tomato & Mozzarella Skewers, and they were all nice. Poke was kind of warm, and Empanada was a bit too salty, but they were still tasty. Artisanal Cheese & Fruit Display and Mediterranean Roasted Vegetables & Dips were thing of beauty.  Great selection, good amount of food, fresh and delicious. Then, there came the steak! They were cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and the seasoning was really great.  

The drinks offered at this events were also very tasty, I enjoyed them all. They looked nice and tasted even better, with just the right amount of alcohol - not too strong nor weak.

I didn't get to try all the food that was served at this event, but I heard only the great things about the ones I missed out on as well.  The servers did their best to keep the area and tables clean, even though the event was a bit chaotic in a small way."}
{"text":"My 5yr anniversary couldn't be any better. They manage their time efficiently. Great staff who were all welcoming with smiles.We got seated looking out the strip & enjoyed our 3 course meal. They charge an extra fee to substitute side dishes which is great since my bf didn't like the options he was able to choose something he would eat. Steak!!! Yummmm!!! I got'medium well' which was perfect & my bf got 'medium', could've been cooked a min more but he finished it. 
To our surprise they brought us our desert with\"happy anniversary\" 
Thank you for a night to remember. Definitely going back in December for more"}
{"text":"I won't gush about the food or service -- if you're willing to pay the beau-coup bucks to go to Ruth's, you know the food is going to be above-average. The gripe I have with our last visit is the 30 minutes we waited for our table during the holiday. For our party of 7 we made sure to have the reservation set long in advance and so we were unhappy to wait uncomfortably in the bar area for the previous party to clear out and our table to be set. It isn't unreasonable to expect some sort of apology (read: freebie) when a large party comes in and has to stand in a cramped area for half an hour, but no such accommodation was made. 

---------

tl;dr Good food, good service, poor reservation management from hostesses and uncomfortable waiting area."}
{"text":"The food was great. The thing that made this experience over the edge amazing was our server Dollianne. She was so helpful in what to eat and she made you feel like one of her friends and was truly hospitable."}
{"text":"Did I like it?so-so....
I'm i gonna come back? Naaah....

I liked the interior, the service was great and they have a good choice of wine. Food? Not so much really. I tried their 'chief salad, and It had some unpleasant aftertaste. The steak was okay, but not the best. 
I think that this pace has become too popular they stopped caring about the quality of their food. Anyway not worth a hundred bucks we paid"}
{"text":"Food: 4.0/5.0
Service: 3.5/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0 

I'm a fan of Ruth's Chris and you should to (unless you truly hate butter on your steak).  Only knock against this spot is that it doesn't offer the Ruth's classic."}
{"text":"Best cut of meat anywhere. Lamb chops to steak, it's all good. Sides are amazing and service is 2nd to none."}
{"text":"Sally our server was excellent.   We ordered the new $39.99 and  $49.99 dinner deals and it was a great price and tons of food.  Sally was on it with the refills.  I mean ON IT....

My fillet was under cooked but they immediatly fixed the problem.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table on a Monday night which was upsetting as they had one dining room empty and some open tables in the room we were in.

I've eaten here several times over the years during spring training and it's always been great.

The flavor was superb...."}
{"text":"This place was horrible for what it is supposed to be. They served me the Tomato and Basil salad with a tomato that wasn't close to being ripe. Yuk. The table wobbled so bad, we had to carry our drinks to the lavatory as they would have spilled otherwise. The Asparagus was as thin as a pencil. 

For a high end steakhouse, you can do much better."}
{"text":"The worst service I've  ever experienced.  Nothing like dropping $400 on dinner for 6 and having to tell the manager how to treat unsatisfied customers. Waited at least 20 minutes for an acknowledgement from a server, while watching the table seated a least 10 minutes after us eating their food-got charged for a bottle of wine we ordered but they didn't have available ...on the plus side when we did get our food it was tasty."}
{"text":"Wir haben an unserem Hochzeitstag im Ruth´s Chris Steak House in Las Vegas mit unserer Family gegessen. 
Der Service war sehr gut und auch sehr aufmerksam. Das Essen war ein Traum und wirklich jeder wurde satt :-) 
Zu unserer Hochzeit haben wir einen kleinen Käsekuchen aufs Haus bekommen (siehe Fotos). 
Preis/Leistung war vollkommen in Ordnung, wenn man die Restaurants in der Stadt miteinander vergleicht (uns wir haben einige Restaurants bereits getestet). 
Bei unserem nächsten Vegasbesuch werden wir mit Sicherheit wieder dort essen gehen."}
{"text":"Man I love Ruth's Chris... it's just so good. 

I travel all over the country for work and I eat at the best steakhouses... oftentimes, I think that I have a delicious steak somewhere that's better that Ruth's, then I have a Ruth's steak and am reminded that it is truly the best... the ONE and ONLY.  

The steak is served on a 500 degree plate with a rich butter sauce. They cook it in a 1000+ degree oven that makes it melt like butter when you knife into it and then place it on your tongue... it's just so good. 

BOTTOM LINE: Wherever you are... you can always count on Ruth's Chris for THE BEST steak."}
{"text":"This is by far me and My boyfriends favorite dinner spot! We go almost every week, the food is always cooked to perfection, and the service is always pristine. Ruth's Chris of South Parke goes above and beyond to make our evening enjoyable with everything from food to service!"}
{"text":"We arrived late... the woman who introduced me to my late wife, and I, arrived after my beloved wife's memorial service, hungry and out of sorts. When the bartender and manager learned the reason for our trip, they extended their condolences and hospitality. When I tried to show them my wife's picture and my phone battery went dark, they charged it... right there at the bar! My Manhattan and my friend's Scotch were poured with perfection. The calamari and the ahi tuna appetizers were enough to provide a delicious meal. They were followed by a round of drinks and a toast to the most wonderful woman I'll ever know. This was more than exemplary food, beverages, and service. This was a kindness and human empathy that is so very rare and precious. I will always view Ruth's Chris Steak House as an extension of our family, from now on. I humbly thank you..."}
{"text":"Review from March  18, 2012 from myTripAdvisor account:

SHES ALWAYS GREAT!!

\" What is there to say except excellent steaks,crab cakes, and creme brulee\"!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had received a gift certificate to Ruth's Chris steak house $100, and decided to go here with my gf on Valentine's Day. I was happy to have the gift certificate because we had the \"Valentine's day special\" ($89/person includes a spinach salad, mini filet, a side and a dessert), a half bottle of cheapest wine was $40, 1 drink ($13) and a 20% tip, ended up being a $285 dollar meal! So for just under $300 my expectations were great food, great presentation and great service. Well at least 1 and a half of my expectations were met. 

We arrived on time and had to wait several minutes to be seated, once seated we received our menus, but did not receive a wine menu 5 minutes after being seated we see our server get the wine menu and everything was great after that. So all in all about 20 minutes after we arrived we got to see a wine menu. I have to admit after that hiccup, the service was great, this was probably the hostesses fault, rather than our server. He rushed through our order and decided to pick our appetizer for us (we had a choice of soup & salad) didn't mention what soup of the day was and just ordered salad for us. The salad came out fast, but the presentation was extremely lacking, it looked like something I would order from a cafeteria. I was utterly unimpressed. The steak came out sizzling soon after with our sides, it was melt in your mouth goodness. It was an amazing steak. Except for the fact the presentation once again was 0. The plate the steak was on was so small I couldn't fit my sides (that come on another plate) on the steak plate. I have no idea who was plating the food that night but it looked worse than Boston Pizza. The dessert came out soon after this and was also incredible. Can't go wrong with bread pudding and crème broulee.  The manager did come by and ask how everything was with each and every table, and we said everything was great and he went on his way, a nice touch. The last thing is we were sitting in one of the auxiliary rooms, with about 10 other tables. So no windows outside, everyone was very quiet, at some points no one was talking in the room. Every time I opened my mouth I felt everyone in the small room was listening to our conversation. They should probably remove a couple of the tables in this room to offer customers a bit more privacy. So ambience was a 5/10. 

This is my problem, the food was absolutely amazing, no complaints. But for just under $300 for 2 people, I am expecting top notch service and the food to be plated and presented worthy of a $42/steak. I have no problem spending the money and have at other restaurants in Calgary, where you can see the chef meticulously placed the asparagus with the steak on a large platter for your eyes and nose to enjoy before your taste buds enjoy. Unfortunately I will not return to Ruth's Chris, overall overpriced and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! What can I say.... This place was wonderful and the food was delicious. I went here for my birthday last week and my server was sooo nice. He made my day so wonderful and comfortable in the new city. Plus he from Illinois as well....Kudos to Jeff"}
{"text":"I emailed the chef, Steven Park, the day before I was planning to visit for dinner, explaining my oil-free, vegan diet. He shared some 3-course meal ideas, and offered to discuss them when I was in the dining room. Upon arrival, I asked the server to inform the chef. He came out and offered lots of off-the-menu options. Ultimately he prepared for me glazed mushrooms on a bed of arugula with kumquat tomatoes as an appetizer, linguine pasta with mixed vegetable sauce as the entree, and a mixed berry salad for dessert. I asked for extra hot green tea, and got exactly that, which is rare!

The rest of the party was carnivorous and everyone enjoyed their steaks."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday. The service was beyond amazing. They took a picture of me and my sister and printed it out and put it in a Ruth Chris fame and gave me 4 copies to take with me. They also gave me a free plate of desserts with a candle and the plate said \"Happy Birthday Evonne\". It made me feel so special! I ordered the stuffed chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. My sister and I shared it. They split the chicken for us. The stuffed chicken was sizzling when they brought it out and stayed hot the whole time while we ate it because it was on a hot plate. I had to ask for new potatoes because they were cold. The meal was very good!!!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steak House is visually fantastic.  The ambiance is relaxing, yet the decor adds a bit of a sophisticated touch. The windows that line the side of the restaurant provide a great view, especially in the evening.  With that said, when you sit down in this steak house, your expectations are already high.

We had an extremely large group of people.  Roughly 50+ people were there who are a part of our Sales Organization.  With this in mind, we had a limited menu which was no problem at all.  They did a great job of taking care of each person.  They had about 6 or 7 waiters who took care of us.  I think the longest my wine glass went empty was for 5 minutes...impressive when you think about how many people we rolled in with. 

Soooo why the 2 star rating? Because the steak I ordered was horrible.  I know I could be a touch more gracious here, but no joke....it was not good.  The cut was fine, it was thick, tender, it looked like heaven.  However....this is the part that gets me.  Butter.  Yes I just said....Butter.  My steak was floating in a plate of....Butter.  Is it just me? Perhaps this is some new fancy thing that's beyond my palate, but DO NOT EVER soak my steak in melted butter.  What I didn't care for was that the buttery taste took over the whole steak.  As I said previously, expectations were already set when I first walked in.  I was expecting a stellar steak, which didn't happen this time.  Also, there wasn't any type of indication that it was going to be prepared that way, if so...I would've opted for one of the other selections we had to choose from.  The sides were good, bread....mashed taters and of course wine were all spot on.

I could probably be a little more forgiving, but for me ambiance and decor don't get the lion share of the ratings.  I would eat dinner in a box on the street and give it 5 stars if the food was spectacular, probably note in the review that the box was a little small......but none the less, I would still drop 5 stars if it was fantastic."}
{"text":"We come here EVERY time we visit Vegas and usually love it.  Not so much tho visit.  Hopefully just a fluke & not the new norm.  Our server (Dolly - who said she had lost her name tag and was wearing Danny's for the night) in the bar was terrible....very slow, forgot to bring items to the table, didn't check back (we had to ask the busser for things).  The food was delicious.....as always.  Service was the downer. Disappointing for Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"We chose Ruths' for our anniversary as we had a good time last year.

Everything was basically the same.  My medium rare bone in rib eye was very good but not headline setting as I am accustomed to with Ruths'. Give it a solid B.  My wife had the BBQ shrimp and found it really good (A-).

We shared the Harvest salad, which wasn't as good as last year (B) and the Lobster Bisque which was excellent (A).

Our check in was very warm and inviting (A).  And our service was friendly and competent. (B).

I love the ambiance of this place I just wish they'd up the steak quality to what I expect."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice.  The meal and service was variable from excellent to ok.  They have a great wine selection and the steaks are done right.  This place is not cheap so make sure your wallet is full.   I would definately go back to see if they can match the service of my first visit."}
{"text":"Party of four , early New Year's Eve dinner. Fair.
I offer my comments having eaten here once before and thought it was good though clearly a step below Capitol Grille down the street. 
They take early reservations, ours for 5:30 They start valet parking at 6:00. So you can drop your guest off at the door, but they can't figure out a way to shuttle from a lot and have the valet claim the car for the guest at the conclusion of the dinner. 
Price fix dinner $75. With wine, party of four approx $425.00. 
Salad tasty but quite small. My rather small though advertised as 14 ounce NY Strip Steak had four pieces of gristle cooked rare though I asked for medium rare. I thought Chef did good job with seasoning, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the steak itself. Food was served on what I would consider all side dishes, small six/seven inch oval ceramic plates. It was not an appetizing presentation, and the same applies to the creamed spinach and potato sides.  The dessert was a mini cheese cake and some type of chocolate ganache cake. Both soft, no contrasting taste. The waiter was okay, the servers very nice. I did not see a manager or supervisor orchestrating the floor flow. 
In the end it was okay, fair, not an early New Years Dinner that we will remember. Hope it is better if we decide to dine there again."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister/husband 11th anniversary dinner.  First time for all of us.  The place is located in what looks like business buildings near Biltmore.  Parking is ample for evening dinner.

The restaruant has a nice bar and was dressed to the 9's.  The hostess and servers were both very polite, which one would expect in an upscale restaurant.  Sissy's husband let them know it was their anniversary when he called in reservations, so there were little confetti hearts on the table.

The server suggested a great bottle of wine to go with dinner.  The other 3 in our party ordered a meal that comes with soup/salad, entree,  2 sides, and tiny dessert selections.  They run about $39-$50 depending on the entree.   We all had steak - duh, steakhouse - and the sides ranged from mashed potatoes, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, and potato augratin.  The sides are large enough to share.  Everything tasted delicious.  The server finished the meal by serving a tiny creme brulee and chocolate mousse selection with the words \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.

Overall, nice experience.  We went at the elderly people's dinner time of 5 pm, so the place was dead @ opening.  It picked up businesses around 630-7pm.  Nice place to celebrate birthday, anniversary."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come here for Christmas Dinner with the family. Unfortunately the experience was really disappointing. The men's room has a gaping raw hole in it. The carpets are very visibly dirty and that's just the start. 3 of the people at my table wanted to order the surf & turf but unfortunately they were out of lobster. Very disappointing. They left my water glass empty for 30 minutes. They didn't bring our wine out with dinner as requested. Had to ask for it(again) On the positive end we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation at 6:30. I was going to get a manager and complain but all they would offer is some money off the bill or some lame excuses. We still took very good care of our water tipping 30%. It wasn't deserved, but it is Christmas after all. We'll be going to Morton's in the future. Skip this place. It's not worth the price."}
{"text":"I'd heard this restaurant advertised a lot on the radio and really wanted to try it.  It was a bit busy when we came in for dinner, but the service was still good.  I ordered a Porterhouse steak and for what we paid for it, it seems to me it should've been a lot more tender than it was.  That was a disappointment, to be sure.  We both ordered sides of creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  They were both very good, but I wish we had known how big they were going to be; one serving is enough for two people.  The steak was huge too, and I probably left 1/3 of it.

Although I was disappointed with the steak, I'd like to give this restaurant chain a second chance."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our family came here for my father in laws birthday and everything  was perfect. The diablo chocolate martini is divine."}
{"text":"What great food! And an excellent experience. Our server Dollianne was amazing!!!  She even sang a light aria for us because she's a classically trained opera singer!!!   Fantastico!!!"}
{"text":"Wow was that sad. Dined with five colleagues. Ordered 3 bottles of expensive wine, appetizers., etc. Server acted like we were in a breakfast diner - loud and coarse. Didn't have a clue how to serve wine and was constantly interrupting conversation. 

Food was okay at best. Nothing special. The constant announcements about the temp of the oven did nothing to help the taste. 

I am being generous with 2 stars. This restaurant isn't even close to Morton's or so many other steakhouses. In Las Vegas I'm surprised it's survived with the competition. 

I'll take a pass on ever wasting my time here again. Further it cements my feeling that Ruths Chris is an over rated chain. It's too easy to do better"}
{"text":"Love the place. Wish I could give it a 5. But as much as I love the ambiance and food, there was plastic on my steak. Yeah I ended up getting it free but I did not expect my expensive steak to have plastic on it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to RC recently for her birthday.  First I will say that the service was very good.  From the beginning to the end, we couldn't have had a friendlier experience.

The good was also really good.  I had a trio dish that included a filet, crabcake and stuffed chicken breast.  All were delicious and although I hate to say it, I think the chicken was my favorite. 

I would definitely recommend RC if you are looking for a nice place to eat...just be prepared to pay for it.  Our meals, with a glass of wine each and tip, was about $175."}
{"text":"Coming to Ruth's Chris Steak House for Lunch during Christmas break has become our tradition.  Folks, they have a nice lunch menu that has some really scrumptious items with all the Ruth's Chris flare!  

Our server, Sasha, was graceful and patient with my little family of four as was the lovely girl filling our water and giving us an endless supply of warm bread and fresh butter (she must have noticed my youngest dipping his knife in the butter and licking it....continuously).  Sasha was prompt to refill my coffee, which was some pretty good coffee in my opinion.

I had the portobello mushroom burger and fries.  It was meh, but the fries were so yummy.  My eldest son got the sirloin burger (should have gotten the burger, but I'm a faux vegetarian right now) and french onion soup (everyone was able to sub their fries for something else).  My youngest got some steak sandwich and lobster bisque (I'm not too sure why he chose that, he later thought he was getting the soup we get at the Costco which is actually tomato bisque...he did not eat it  **SHOCKER!!**)  The bread for that steak sandwich was like Texas Toast, only better.

On to dessert, because life is short, you need dessert!  The youngest wanted Creme Brulee, and luckily we convinced him to go with the cheesecake.  Guys, this is not your average cheesecake.  You know how some cheesecakes have a tang?  Well, this is mild and smooth and there is an abundance of graham cracker crust.  Next to it is a smidgen of fresh fruit that makes this dessert even more blissful when you mix the two together.  

It was expensive for a family of four around $100.00 including drinks and dessert...but this isn't your average lunch place either."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our anniversary dinner here. Food was great, and prices were not bad at all. They have a special that always on the menu that includes starter, entree, side, & dessert for about $46. We will surely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious steak, lobster, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and dessert. I enjoyed excellent conversation with a long time friend and former college roommate. Our server and team did a very nice job serving our table. Kept the water glasses full, fresh bread on the table and clean. Overall the food was very good with solid service."}
{"text":"Stuffed chicken was excellent and lobster Mac and cheese OMG!!!! Excellent service great experience! !!"}
{"text":"Brought a party of 10 here for a corporate hosted appreciation dinner for key clients. The staff here was great, the servers were outstanding, and the food was so delicious. The wine suggesions were also spot on. Would definitely bring a group back here again.  We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I would like to say for the amount we paid for our dinner it was not worth it. My boyfriend and I both ordered the salmon and it came out over-cooked. It took 20 minutes to even get our food that we didn't want to send it back and just ate it anyway. I was not impressed by Ruth's Chris. The salmon was less than basic."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant while in town for our date night. We usually go to the Fresno location and we will now be sticking to only Fresno. The Vegas location was disappointing to say the least. The bread tasted like a loaf of white room temperature bread compared to the Fresno's warm crunchy rolls. Our service was not up to par as we had to ask a person not assigned to our table for some water. Vegas didn't have the Ruth's Classic option like Fresno has which is a very good option for a night out. Overall we will not be returning to the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"The host was very accommodating! The Bartender Rose was very helpful in helping me order my food! I felt well taken care of and was very happy with the service! The food review is to be continued!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is awesome.  My tenderloin was a perfect medium rare and had great flavor in addition to being incredibly tender.  The sides were great, rich but flavorful potatoes au gratin and tender asparagus with a tasty hollandaise sauce.  Excellent service and nice ambience.  This place is better than Fleming's but not quite as good as Tornado Club though it is almost there."}
{"text":"Meh. So disappointed in the meal. Steaks were average though prepared to our specs. Flavor so bland even though we asked for and ordered flavorful cuts. We were promised a great and flavorful steak and we got bland. Appetizers were OK. Service and ambience were fine. Go to Capitol Grille!"}
{"text":"I had called ahead and told them it was my Anniversary they could have cared less ... from the attitude at the front desk we never did order it was so bad we left there are to many other places to eat in Charlotte this place has a attitude I tried to explain to the manager they where busy she said she could get me another table .... I said no thanks I had a reservation WOULD NEVER GO BACK EVER . I did contact their corporate office mind you this was the second time I had problems with Ruth Chris in 2 states 3 weeks earlier in Ohio the server broke our plate glass everywhere and she came back with our steak  about 3 minutes later and I asked her if it was the same steak .... I did not want to eat glass she said no I checked every piece I ate then before that the same server told us how the salad size has been cut in half the last month or so TERRIBLE.! We finally where  sent to the Ruth Chris in Greensboro NC ( threw their Corp office ) and the meal was very good I should not have had to go threw all that to get a good meal!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite date night restaurant. Service is always wonderful and the food is always incredible. I live for the sweet potato casserole! It is so yummy."}
{"text":"As always, excellent service & meal.  Loved the calamari (especially the tomato sauce) and Crab Stack.  The Lamb Chops were one of best we've ever had (perfectly cooked).  Only slight miss was our Rib Eye was more medium than medium-rare, but it still tender and full of flavor (we may order NY next time as we like our steak a bit firmer).

Our Casino Host joked about going here since we had a RC back home, but friends had never tried it, so RC it was and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Ruth's Chris downtown. My friend and I decided to spoil ourselves with a great steak dinner this weekend. We had picked up some gift cards at Costco for 20% off, ($80 for $100 value) but since the restaurant limits you to using only one card per person, the discount is quite minimal at the end of the meal. Still, $20 off is better than a kick in the pants. 

We ordered a nice bottle of Italian Chianti, which is my friend's favourite type of wine right now. I usually prefer a Cabernet Sauvignon with my steak, but the Chianti was quite nice. For dinner, we started out with a Caesar salad each, followed by the 8 oz. petite filet. For sides, we had the mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts and for dessert we had crème brûlée with a cup of coffee. 

I do love how the plates come out sizzling hot. It's nice being able to enjoy your food without it getting cold too quickly. My steak was a perfect medium rare, and the texture of the filet was incredible (see photo). Far superior to the steak I had at Barberian's not too long ago. 

Service here is top notch, as well. Although, the first time I dined here, I felt the waiter was a bit cold. He was an older gentleman and was too serious and stuffy for my taste. Perhaps it's a generational thing. Our server this time was much more friendly and relaxed, while still being very professional. 

It is an expensive restaurant, but if you're looking for a great steak dinner and have some cash to spare, I highly recommend Ruth's Chris. They also offer a 3-course dinner for $59.95 each, but your options are limited to 3 or 4 choices. Still, a great value if you like the options offered, and I believe they do change from time to time."}
{"text":"Went in on the Travelzoo special. Birthday dinner, I know, big spender but it was a great deal!

We had a semi circle booth facing west out the windows. Started with the spicy lobster. Really good. Then split the Ruth's chopped salad. We both ordered the Ribeye steaks which were cooked to perfection. 

Our side was the lobster mac n' cheese. Kind of weak. basic macaroni noodles with lobster and cheese on top. Not much substance under the toppings.

Had the deal with the bottle of wine upgrade. 

Our server Angie and her assistant were awesome!

Ended with the chocolate explosion for desert.

It was quite a bit of food overall and a good value. Had to wrap up a few things to take home for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Fabulous happy hour! Caesar is always so attentive! Quality beyond expectations! We always find time to stop at this little hidden treasure when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I agree with everything Neil has said below.

Tenderloin is awesome.

If you're looking for ambiance go to a pretentious place with over-priced, small portions. For around $200 you and a partner will be sated.

The creme brulee is amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my experience here ends up being compared to a much superior Del Friscos.  Having had the exact same thing a day earlier (excessive, I know), the comparison is inevitable.  I felt as if my filet was just ok.  It was slightly on the bland side and more rare than I expected (a good thing depending on how you like it).  The thing I don't like about Ruth's Chris is their overuse of butter.  My steak came out in covered and practically swimming in butter.

Service was pretty damn good for our party of 10 and our waiter even engaged us in some good wine talk, so this review gets a boost.

4 stars.  Ruth's is adequate for your above average steakhouse, but if you can swing it, try Del Friscos instead, it's not too far away."}
{"text":"This is a very romantic place! 

Although with the food being a bit overpriced, I would rather stick to happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok so I finally can write a decent review for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  Why?  Well all the times I had ever gone, I ordered....fish.  Yes I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.  It's almost like going to a Japanese restaurant and asking for a burger!  That's the main reason why I haven't written a review for them.  Now I finally can.

There are two Ruth Chris Steakhouse in Vegas.  Both of them are  fine restaurants.  

-Filet Mignon (Comes in two sizes: 12 oz and Petite 6oz) : Cooked to perfection.  They charred the outside and juicy throughout.

-Mash Potatoes (All sides are big enough to share, they are family style): Fluffy and buttery.

-Asparagus (again big enough to share):  Cooked just perfect and not over done.

-French Onion Soup- It had a great crispy outter shell and the soup was not too salty like some places.  This is a must have. 

All in all I had a great experience and would definitely consider going back here again.  

If you're in Vegas we found out that after 11pm they have their happy hour specials and their steaks and lobster is 50% OFF.  A local told us that."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our first date here and tonight we celebrate our 1st year of marriage and I cannot think of a better place. The food cannot be matched.

I would like to give a special shoutout to our amazing waiter, Manny as well as Andrew who served us on our first date. Thanks to every one of the staff who made tonight such a special night!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best steakhouse! My husbands special treat would be the huge tomahawk ribeye. He said it is perfectly cooked to temperature, minimally seasoned so that he can enjoy the full beef flavor and is tender and juicy. My favorite is their filet, however per their suggestion due to preferring a higher temperature, they butterfly the filet to allow it to be perfectly cooked to my request yet remain juicy and melt in your mouth tender. The side options will never disappoint neither will their specialty drinks and deserts. For a truly special experience, go hungry and enjoy this remarkable place."}
{"text":"Great location and good spot for working lunches! We enjoy bringing clients here."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience here this past weekend.  We had to wait 45 minutes for someone to take our order, and then when the food was finally served, 3 out of 4 steaks were cooked incorrectly.  We had to send them all back, and then one was again not cooked correctly.  Not sure how a place that calls itself a high end steak house can do that.

Our waiter did his best to make things right, but the runners, assistants, or whatever you call them were rude and incompetent, not to mention they had questionable personal hygiene.

The manager did give us a discount and apologized, but there is no excuse.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We have come here twice in the past for two family events, and we were never let down. 4 stars for a lack of communication, the last time we came we were waiting for 20 minutes while our table was ready, since after we \"signed in\", no one bothered to call us.
all the rest was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh. 
Was it a good steak? Sure. A little better than 'okay'
Was it the best steak I've ever had? Not even close. 

Considering the price, ambience, and how well known the name is, I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience."}
{"text":"Chose Ruth Chris as my Downtown Restaurant Week choice. Very, very pleased. 

$40 got me a salad, 4oz filet and shrimp, and dessert. 

Wonderful service, great atmosphere, and the food was spot on."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ruth's Chris. The filet is amazing, I love the creamed spinach, and the servers are super knowledgeable about the wine. My only complaint is that the last time I went, they lost our reservations- we kept our email confirmation and they were super nice and got us seated pretty quickly, but it was a little annoying."}
{"text":"After a long day working a booth at a convention, time just sorta stood still when I took my first bite of my medium rare, perfectly prepared ribeye.  The sizzling plate added the perfect audio accompaniment to the other senses that were bursting with cutlery pleasure. 

My only regret is that I had to stop this incredible dining sensation when I sadly became stuffed too soon. I look forward to returning again for another moment in time."}
{"text":"Having been long time Ruth Chris patrons, this location was beyond disappointing. 

1.  Had 830 reservations, was seated at 855.  The restaurant was NOT packed,  so it was poor management. 

2.  There is a photographer who walks around taking pictures for events..... are you kidding me?!?!  A dim, romantic setting is quickly ruined with  a lady soliciting $25 photos accompanied by a BIG ass flash.

Not often do you see a high end restaurant   become a low class tourist trap.

So sad."}
{"text":"Paid this place a visit for a late Valentine's Day dinner. Overall food was good, not excellent. The price range turns you off a bit as they charge you an arm and a leg. I liked the chicken that the fiancé ordered rather than my surf and turf dinner. I've had my share of quality steaks though I couldn't find a difference between prime and choice. I would go again but definitely order the chicken that the fiancé had."}
{"text":"Another Arizona Restaurant week visit.

This was our first time to Ruth's Chris...and I must say we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

The decor was a nice, dark wood appearance, which I always enjoy in a steak joint.  The server was by pretty quick after our seating to explain everything, came back in about just the right amount of time afterwards to actually take our order (about 5-7 minutes).  We got the AZ Restaurant Week 3 course deal.  $29 for it, was hard to beat.  

First course: Wife got the Tomato and Crab soup, of which I got a taste, and it was excellent.  My caesar salad was quite good also (had shavings and pieces of real parmesan cheese).  

2nd course:  We both got the petite filet, hers Medium, mine medium rare.  I got the garlic mashed she got the mushrooms.  She didn't think that the mushrooms were seasoned to be anything special (like good 'ol Jonah's back in IL).  But they were good from what she said.  The garlic mashed potatoes were tasty also.  The steak.  It comes out on a plate...sizzling in the butter they slathered on it.  Mine seemed a little more rare than medium rare..but it continued to cook on the plate...so it ended up being just right.  Cooked up even quicker if you slice it up and give it just a few moments.  I have no idea how they seasoned it...but we got nothing special on it.  Yet..it was SO VERY tasty.  It had an excellent flavor, was very tender.  It was steak happiness in every bite.  

3rd course: We got the \"Sin Cake.\"  It was a piece of chocolate cake.  It was more like a wedge of awesome fudge that was encased in delicious chocolate syrup.  Yes..it was a little rich...but wow...it was so darn tasty.  

It was a great dinner.  The only nit I would say I had was we didn't see where it said to park until we passed by the place and had to run around the block.  Not a show stopper though (parking is off of 22nd St. right by Camelback if you've never been, as we had not been).  Also it would be nice if they put out a sign that the deck is free parking for the restaurant in the evening instead of having the valet have to tell everyone would be helpful.  While it made the whole experience of getting there a slight adventure..it was still well worth it, and a great evening had by all."}
{"text":"Great meal.  Mothers Day with the family and all the food was excellent.  Pricey but atmosphere, staff food and service is second to none in the area."}
{"text":"Quote of the night \"its not the size the counts, its how rich it is\" in reference to their chocolate sin cake. So true, but I get ahead of myself.

First off, as you may have gathered, this place is expensive. Don't think that $50 gift card will go far. That's the lower end for an entree. For one. With no drinks. You have been warned.

We brazenly walked in to Ruth's on an unassuming Saturday night without reservations, taking the hostesses unawares with the aforementioned brazenness. No tables of course, but the bar is (always) available. We were seated within 2 minutes. 80% of the time, this strategy works 100% of the time. 

Upon being seated, were with greeted with a handshake and introduction to the bar-staff (waaaa?) while not one, but two napkins and full flatware was laid out. An interesting beginning to the evening. Fantastic service, but I am just unaccustomed to shaking hands with a server (hope they wash their hands...)

The leather-bound menu looks as amazing as it was heavy. We both opted for the Classic menu selection, which includes a starter (soup or salad), entree, side, and dessert for between $40-$50 depending on the entree. Considering that many sole entrees start at $60, this was a pretty good deal. To got different starters and sides to maximize the experience. 

*Tip for the Try-Frugal (you want to try it, but lack a trust fund): Come with a friend, get the Classic Menu Selection and split it. Unless you haven't eaten in a while, it'll suffice.

Starters:
- The tortilla soup (an item I traditionally associate with Mexican restaurants) was much better than I had expected for a steakhouse. Well played! 

- The arugula, mandarin & Prosciutto Salad, on the other hand, did not really do it for me. I think that I could buy all the ingredients ready-made (including the ubiquitous canned mandarins) from Costco and make it myself. I just expected more.

Winner: the tortilla soup

Sides:
- Creamed Spinach: these came recommended and I can see why, it is about 50% cream. I am in no way complaining. If it is one thing that Ruth does well, its dairy. The bartender totally called this. 

- Garlic Mashed Potatoes: A let down, particularly after seeing how glorious their baked potatoes looked. These are your grandma's garlic potatoes, maybe a little drier and light on the garlic. Although, it was brought to my attention that my lackluster reaction may be the result trying it after the rich creamed spinach. You can decide.

Winner: Baked potato (the one I briefly mentioned in passing). What can I say, I looked really, really good. Honorable mention to the creamed spinach.

Entree:
- Stuffed Chicken Breast: Oh. My. God. I was so blind before, but THIS is what willis was talking about all along. Even our good friend the bartender said that this was the best item on the menu. It is a double chicken breast \"stuffed with garlic herb cheese and served with lemon butter\". Poking it causes volcanic eruptions of gooey cheese. I ate all of it. And I am not sorry. Seriously amazing!

- Filet: Honestly, I didn't care for it. A bit lacking in flavor and dry for me, although adding one of the compliments (cheese or pepper sauce) may alleviate this. Perhaps I just don't know how to appreciate a good steak? Who knows. I'd never do it again.

Clear winner: chicken breast!!!!

Dessert:
Chocolate sin cake x2 (the only dessert available on the value menu)
- One is enough for two, as it is a flour-less chocolate cake (i.e., fudge). You need to smother it in cream in order to stuff it down your gullet; otherwise the richness can cause you to choke. Though, my favorite part though was the witty remark from our new bff the bartender in response to an inquiry on the size of the dessert: \"size doesn't matter the counts, its how rich it is\". Truly, it was your bartendery wisdom that left me satiated me that evening. 
 

*Actually not our bff. I was merely trying to describe the growing feelings of affection towards the bartender--which all started with a handshake.

TIP2: shake hands with your wait staff (just be sure to be aware of and obey any local laws which may run contrary to this tip)"}
{"text":"Location is but make sure ask for a window seat near the front of the restaurant with a view of the strip.  If you don't ask there is a chance you will get stuck in the back of the restaurant with a less desirable view of the carnival bar and the entrance to the Linq hotel. If you want to have a romantic dinner and sit together, ask to sit in a booth.
This is the high end restaurant in Harrahs you will get a very mixed clientele.  You will observe jeans and  short sleeve shirts with their Coors Light from the casino to older couples elegantly dressed. The service is good, wait staff is very attentive.  Food is what you expect from Ruth Chris. Steak is great !! Creamed spinach and cheesecake dessert, great, potatoes au gratin under cooked."}
{"text":"Went here for thanksgiving dinner.

Ambiance was not good.  In a strip mall.  Not great service.

Lots better in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I work no more than 5 minutes  from this location and love their happy hour specials! Only complaint is the super slow service when sitting outside on the patio, otherwise the food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I know it's an American franchise, I know it's à la carte dining, but I still remember my first time there and the quality of the steak really blew me away.  Nothing has changed in successive visits so it remains to be one of my favourite places to this day.

The staff are hyper attentive making sure that every detail is taken care of during the course of your meal.  The wine list is easily navigated to find something that will compliment the meal.  When it comes to the meal, you should be warned of a few things.  Everything comes à la carte, meaning that you're paying for side dishes but they're so ample, you'll be splitting them anyway.  The reason that Ruth's Chris steaks sizzle when they come to you is that they're doused in butter.  It's gorging at its best.  Oh, and the portions are huge.  I typically order the New York cut which comes out approximating the size of one of my mother's meatloafs.

Fret not, you're able to take it home with you.  They get that a lot."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and absolutely love the place!  Food is always awesome - one time I had the fish special and didn't love it - they immediately took it back and gave me one of my favorite items from the regular menu.  The service is great and the wine list is exceptional.  I don't even eat red meat, but love the crabcakes, walleye and the hashbrowns.  This is the best restaurant on the west side of Madison/Middleton."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Maybe a little too much butter, but its a once in a while meal... The food came out on their very hot plates and the wine was great. We had a group dinner for the company and they were very attentive to everyone. All in all it was great experience and I would eat there again."}
{"text":"My first night here a colleague and I were walking around looking for a bite to eat. The first thought in our heads were, \"Dang, there are a lot of steak houses.\"

Stopped in and got sat near a window. We perused and both decided on Alberta beef; when in Ro- er Calgary. I ordered the New York and another ordered the tenderloin and it was a brick of tenderness. I ordered mine rare, which was perfect because it came out on a super sizzling plate and the bottom the steak crusted. There are family-style sides you can order the sides at half order, and my companion and I ordered a couple each. It was wayyy too much food! For two people order 2 half orders and that's it! Server was great and non-intruding. I would say it was a really great dining experience from beginning to end. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is over rated!! You would think that the food would be up to par for their prices. NOPE! It isn't worth the money! We had the ribeye; too salty & the meat doesn't melt in your mouth. The lamb chop; had a very strong odor to it. The crab cakes were too salty. Pretty much everything was too salty. So think twice before coming here for good steak or food! Food sucks for being a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"My steak was exceptionally good, I had to wait a little bit longer than excepted but the food made up for that.
I always like coming into a nice atmosphere it sets the mood for the rest of the night, If your in the area & in the mood for stake stop by."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty steak. Highly recommend the filet or the filet with shrimp. The sides are huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering. My dad ordered the lobster and it wasn't the best...but it is a steakhouse...
There desserts are all amazing. I recommend the banana cream pie, creme brulee, or bread pudding."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! If your looking for a great steak look no further, they are hands down the best I've ever had! The server was awesome, very attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu, plenty of suggestions and he made our first visit very easy and enjoyable! If your looking for somewhere memorable for some special occasion this place is it, huge wine list, awesome deserts, quick service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The bisque, shrimp with creole remoulade, potatoes, and salad. Everything was perfect! 

My husband really liked the meat. 

The restaurant decor is pretty stiff and stagnant with a conservative energy flow; not trendy or fun at all, but the food makes you forget about all that.

Wait staff did a great job. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Steak..steak..steak. ..The filet melts in your mouth. The rib eye is good but not extraordinary. The more notable side dish is the pecan crusted sweet potato casserole. Service is good when not busy. When they become busy, the server seems to have disappeared:-)"}
{"text":"Anthony herbert the manager is so awesome. The food is impressive and the salmon dish melted in your mouth. The potato augratin was refreshing"}
{"text":"My wife and I have a toddler, our in laws were in town so we took advantage of the free baby sitting. We decided to go to a dinner dinner to celebrate. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was GREAT. Then I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye!!! It was perfect! I know this is going to sound a little strange, but we also ordered the shoe string french fries and my wife and I ate every last one of them! Those were awesome, now I know what you're thinking french fries at a steak house? These french fries are AWESOME! Give it a shot."}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale....best steak house! 
They have many locations near you!
Plenty of parking. Located on 2nd floor. Elevator available. Walked in no reservation required for party of 2. We had very attentive hosts. The sizzling steaks came out perfect!"}
{"text":"Dinner hosted by investment firm.  Our table of 5 all received steaks (4 NY Strips, 1 Filet) well over the cook temperature we ordered. Sad they had to ruin such a good quality piece of meet. The place is old and worn out. Needs to face lift."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in the last two weeks. 

First was with my family (8 people) and we all had the classics dinner. The salad and steaks were good, but that dessert was horrible (pastry shell with strawberries and two chocolate balls on the side). I would have been happier if they served store bought dessert.

Second was last Saturday with my wife. We ordered crab cakes, ravioli and rib eye. The crab cakes were wayyy salty. The ravioli was pedestrian. The steak though was the star of the show. Sizzling, juicy, 16oz steak.

Service during both visits was ok - pedestrian again. Will probably be back but not in the near future. 

I noticed that a couple people mentioned (either here or the toronto location) about the manager not visiting their table. Happened to us too. Not a big deal to me, but if he knew where I lived (on Mississauga road), he probably would have bothered to spend quite some time with us. They always do once they know :)"}
{"text":"Really great meal and terrific staff!"}
{"text":"On travel in Cleveland. Many restaurants to choose from but wasn't in the mood to be dissatisfied. Ruth's Chris never fails when it come to my insatiable palate. Had a simple dinner, crab cakes and house salad. Had no complaints. Rachel and Anthony were engaged and enhanced my dining experience. Thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"If you have been to one, you have been to them all.

That being said - this location: Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it. Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'. Great service, tasty steak. Highly recommend the filet or the filet with shrimp. The sides are huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering.  The au gratin potatos where thick and creemy and loaded with melted cheese on top - which makes anything that much better!

The service is very attentive - even for a large group.  Sometimes this was a drawback or tunr-off when you are having a convesations and constantly being fawned over by service staff.

If I ever do go back to that location - I will want to take advantage of the outdoor patio area with fire pit and enjoy the Arizona night."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome dinner with Lesley. We were invited by Brent & Susan Brewer. Such a good choice... Steaks were amazing! Sautéed mushrooms along with mash-potatoes. Everything was delicious and the company made it even better!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were taken here by our best friends. Before we went I had checked out what my fellow Yelpers thought about the place, so I was a bit apprehensive about going there. I must report that it turned out to be a wonderful evening of visiting while enjoying some fine dining and great service. I had the fillet and stuffed chicken breast, my wife had the salmon and our friends had the fillet and BBQ shrimp and we all had the harvest salad. All of our entrees were cooked and seasoned to perfection. For sides we ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, green beans (2) and creamed spinach. We soon discovered I thought that each side can have easily be enough for all four of us, as we  had some left green beans. These side dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I noticed that they had creamed spinach as a side and I remembered what a great dish it was at the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco many years ago, so I thought I would give it a try and ordered it. I was so pleased that It met and maybe exceeded my expectations, as my friends were amazed at how good it tasted. Our server Adam was excellent offering some great service without being pretentious.  In short we had a very pleasant evening at a very nice upscale steak house that offers great food and service that really makes it a value for you money."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here last weekend and it was perfect. We had a window seat and the view was great especially at night, it added to the ambiance for sure. Hubs and I shared a humongous porterhouse, it was divine not overly seasoned but lusciously buttered. Omg it was bomb. We also had the scalloped potatoes and onion rings both were on point. I tried a grapefruit vodka drink and it was also very good. The service was great, they even brought us a pretty dessert since we were celebrating. We will definitely return to Ruth Chris again."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris might be your go-to place for ordering that sizzling butter-topped steak in the evening, but little does anyone know of it's other delicious offering as an ideal spot for Sunday Brunch. I dedicate this review to one dish that stands out far ahead of its peers...

Truly, nothing beats a hangover like Eggs Benedict \"a la Ruth's Chris.\" You get two golden-toasted halves of an english muffin which are then topped with a juicy piece of FILET (recommended medium-rare)! You could probably eat that dish right there as is, but then they go ahead and top the muffins off with a soft-boiled egg (perfect yolky texture), and slather on a creamy homemade hollandaise. I can't compare anything to the experience of eating this dish. It's in its own stratosphere. The steak gives \"bite\" to the dish and the yolk is soaked up by the muffin. An ingenious construction of the culinary mind, these eggs ARE worth writing home about. I dont' know if they put crack in the muffins, or lace the meat with somethin suspect, but I'm clamoring for more and now look forward to every Sunday just to get my $20 brunch. 

There's a certain level of class in the presentation and even though you're probably eating a caloric bomb, you don't feel \"heavy\" at the end. I'm not just hyping this dish up. It really is the most amazing eating experience you'll have in awhile, especially if you're looking for something new. 

If you haven't tried this then you're missing out on life. This is one of those things you'd enjoy if you happen to like things that are delicious. I fall in that demographic and so I'm recommending it for your eating pleasure!

5/5"}
{"text":"always have a great time eating and dining. excellent service. the photographer good do better on picture taking so we didn't purchase any from last night."}
{"text":"Food was amazing... Steak was medium well done and done right...20oz Lobster was really good as well, and our service with Angie was fast and on point!!! Thanks fellas for this great experience..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Price is a little high but for the food and service, it's nothing. I ordered the stuffed chicken and it's delicious. Chicken was moist and the seasoning on it was perfect. Plates were very hot and it lasted the whole meal. I got it with their Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes and everything came out perfect. Had desert as well and everything was great. The service we had was excellent as well. Will come again on celebratory nights. Great place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak house that's ever come to light.  Especially with the long awaited return to Las Vegas inside of Harrah's Casino.  My first experience with Ruth Chris was in Los Angeles on a birthday weekend three years ago.  I thought I just happen to find a really nice steak house, but everywhere else I have ever compared it to have come nothing but too short.  The location here in Las Vegas delivered exactly the same consistency I remembered!

I always order the three course meal for $69, which includes an 8oz filet, a side dish, house salad or lobster bisque, and of course a dessert of pure chocolate that takes you into a fantasy island.  I've had other meals and all are seasoned with the most flavorful seasonings a man can only dream of.  If it wasn't for the price, I'd probably be at Ruth Chris every single day.  Well worth the prices though.  The real review aside from the other items on there menu is for the steaks.  They must slow cook them for two days, because I can't figure out how they get that tender on the steak.  When it came to my table my plate was probably still 200 degrees it was that hot!  The savory taste of the melted butter on top warranted no additional seasoning required.

If you're looking for the best steak in the world and want an evening of romance and fun, look no further.  You'll die and wake up in steak heaven.  Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience and service! Best steakhouse around! Enjoyed the experience, steak and drinks last night. Bartender was top notch last night as was the service. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Mmmm good!! Well I don't think I have ever eaten bad food at Ruth's Chris. First time here in Vegas and it was a better experience then the one in San Antonio. Service is always excellent. Love the ambience and the view is amazing! Had the Cowboy steak which is a rib eye encrusted with blue cheese!! Wholly crap was it great! Sweet potatoes are phenomenal, love the bread and butter, great Caesar salad, Mac n cheese, and mushrooms. Food is great and so is everything else. Great atmosphere for date night or any occasion!"}
{"text":"Food is always consistent ! Great creme brulee and scalloped potatoes service is amazing as well"}
{"text":"Ok, I do not usually do expensive steak houses, but this was my first trip to Las Vegas, and I wanted one really memorable meal if I won any money there.  So after battling the slot machines for about 5 hours, I finally hit a small jackpot and said to myself \"time to celebrate with a good meal.\"   Since the restaurant was right near the casino, I decided to treat myself.

Walking in the door of this place....and the aroma of grilled meat takes over.  Yeah, thank god for cows. 

I like New York Strip Steaks, and this one was a nice sized, sizzling steak (yes, you do hear it come to your table, and yes, that plate is hot!).  I also had a loaded baked potato which was the biggest potato I had ever seen.  The steak was a little more done than I wished for, but even so, it was so tender you did not need a knife.  And nicely seasoned, too!  I don't go for sauces.  I want to taste the steak.  This did not disappoint.  But if you want medium, you may be wise to order it medium rare, because my steak did not have any pink in the center.  It may have left the grill that way, but hitting that plate at 500 degrees probably cooked it a bit more.  

My only complaint was the salad.  Or should I say the dressing for the salad.  It was rather salty and had an unusual after taste.  

Oh well....it is a steak house.  A damn good one, too.  But that chicken that just passed me....well maybe the next trip.  It looked real fine.  

Service is very attentive, but not pushy."}
{"text":"The lamb chops were delicious u have to get the cream spinach and the garlic mash a must my son steak juicy and tender my wife's stuffed chicken was excellent will return"}
{"text":"I love steak and this is probably in the top 3 steaks that I have ever had. It was super expensive but I was using a gift card that I had received from my sister, so did not feel too bad. The steak was cooked to perfection and was exquisite. Would not go here on a regular basis because of the $ but a great place if you are trying to impress clients or a date and you don't mind spending."}
{"text":"You are probably eating at Ruth's Chris for one of four reasons....

1. You are from out of town and staying at the hotel.
2. You are using a corporate charge card.
3. You are having a special occasion.
4. The gift cards from Costco seemed like a good idea.

Well, whatever your reason, here is how it is....

1. The steaks are cooked exactly to temperature. However, they are not as flavorful as those found for the same basic price at Jacob's.

2. The side items are tasty. The place does a good job of offering both healthy (broccoli and asparagus) sides, as well as a range of potato varieties. The mashed potatoes are spot on.

3. The service is ok, but too pushy. After I said \"no\" when asked if I wanted an appetizer, I was asked again two minutes later. The same thing happened with the second cocktail, a glass of wine, and dessert. The place was not busy, so maybe the waiter needed me to spend more so the tip would be greater. Either way, I didn't like being asked again after I had said no four different times.

All in all, Ruth's Chris is good, and totally good for any of the four reasons for coming here. However, the service, flavor of the steaks, and overall experience doesn't help differentiate this place from other excellent local choices."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. Filet was dry..for the money you spend..they should serve a better quality.  This was our third time (different cities of course) and I will not frequent the restaurant again..there are to far too many good steakhouses out there to waste my money on this one...one large potato for $11...silly..I am done with them.."}
{"text":"Been to this Ruth Chris before. I had the Sea Bass, which was REALLY GOOD, juicy and not over cooked My husband had the Cowboy style, he said it was good also. Beth our waitress and suggested Talbott wine which was good it had the buttery Chardonnay which I like.NOW THE MASHED POTATOES WAS NASTY!!! They tasted like instant mashed potatoes with water!! The crazy part was the waitress Beth even said she ended up tasting them and theY was nasty BUT WE STILL PAID 10 BUCKS FOR SOME INSTANT MASHED POTATO!!! We had the mashed potatoes before and they WAS good, that's why we got them again... WELL TODAY WAS DIFFERENT!!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in VEGAS we have dinner here.. best steak of your life!  Took me a while too spend 50 bucks on just a steak ... but sometimes ya just got to for this piece of heaven !! Love this Vegas location ! View is top notch as well as service !! Thank you !"}
{"text":"I'm partial to steak and Ruth's Chris is the epitome of awesome beefy goodness. Came here for my anniversary with my wife and had an excellent time. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and surprised me and my wife with a special anniversary dessert and took a photo of the two of us. By the way, the steak was amazing, perfectly cooked, and butter soft. This is one of my favorite steakhouses in all of the land!"}
{"text":"Steaks are hit or miss. Wait staffs are the same too. Guess it depends on the timing."}
{"text":"Came here for my Gf birthday dinner and I'm so glad we chose this place. Its located on top of or inside of Harrah's. We had a nice window seat where we could see all the people walking between the casinos. We brought our  own wine the cork fee is $35 it is well worth to bring your own. The steak I  order was. the 16 oz Ribeye medium well, this was one good size piece of Steak and was super juicy. The sides we ordered where Au Gratin which is  Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese and The grilled asparagus, you can get go wrong with steak and asparagus. We shared the sides cause that how they come you order a plate to share between two, I don't know if it is different if you got more than two people. We. Also got some sauté onions on the side on the side. Over all we had a good dinner everything was delicious. The steak was pretty big I almost didn't finish it. Can't wait to visit this place again if not here then one of there other locations."}
{"text":"What can I say ~ I Love Ruth's Chris!

From the moment I walked in I was waited on with the utmost attention.

I made a reservation for some friends and I.
I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)

PJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet)
He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive. 
Thanks PJ~

Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.

I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.

My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.

After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)

I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in my meal.  Let me start by saying that the service was excellent.  Outside of that, the experience was very average.  We ordered crab cakes for an appetizer and they were adequate.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad.  Very small for the price paid.  The real disappointment for me was the main dish.  I ordered the 11 oz filet cooked medium.  It was WAY overcooked.  It was gray all the way through, no pink whatsoever.  It also seemed like it lacked any seasoning at all.  For the first time ever in a steakhouse of that caliber (or price), I had to use salt and pepper to give my filet taste.  The kicker was the $11 mashed potatoes we bought to share.  I assumed they were family style, but it was about 2-3 spoonfuls of potatoes each, and they were also very average.

The final bill was over $200 and I honestly felt the Outback next door would have been better.  Maybe we were just there too early or caught the cook on an off night, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend going."}
{"text":"The various 'Licious meals is always a hit and miss in terms of quality and service, but Ruth Chris delivers on both! The restaurant is on the second floor, so there is a elevator on the main level entrance to take you up to the right level. The atmosphere is a throw back to old school dining, with attentive waiters, full linen and little touches of elegance. 

Their specialty is steak and they have mastered it. Our steaks were made perfectly to our request and served on a hot plate to ensure a warm peice of meat throughout the dining experience. Definitely worth the visit if you want steak done the right way."}
{"text":"The FIRST TIME I've ever eaten a steak without ketchup!  No, seriously.  My family has teased me for years, but I like the taste of steak with ketchup, always have.  Didn't need it here!

Celebrated Father's Day a little early with dear hubby. Reservation for 6:00 PM, we were greeted BY NAME by each person who served us. Having never been here before, really didn't know what to expect, but our server was killer polite and helped us understand the steak prep a little better. 

I had the harvest salad (the best salad I've ever had, no lie, and it was HUGE!) and DH had the caesar.  He said it was very good. We ordered wine, which complimented the meal spectacularly.  We each had the filet with shrimp combo, and DH had the blue cheese crumble topping on his. I think I died and went to steak heaven!  The topping was crunchy, creamy, and just delicious.  Like I said before, no ketchup anywhere on my plate.  I have never tasted a steak so delicious, so tender, so awesomely cooked with awesomeness.  We also had creamed spinach (meh), garlic green beans (these were delish) and a crab cake (again, delish!).

All in all, a terrific dinner.  Well over $200, but a terrific dinner nonetheless.  Already planning a return trip for 10th wedding anniversary.  Can you say, \"GIFT CARDS!?!!\""}
{"text":"I can't say one bad thing about this restaurant, the food, or the service. There are very few places where u actually get a different experiences because you're paying for it. They are all so friendly, professional and knowledgable. The manager greeted us as we arrived and we were seated within 10 minutes due to the fact that we arrived earlier than our reservations. Our waitress was SoYon a korean lady who was so helpful and friendly and never over monitored the table. We had the three course meal and started with the steakhouse salad with the house vinaigrette, then the 16oz ribeye cooked medium with a perfect pink center and had the most amazing mashed potatoes on earth and the pecan candied sweet potatoes. Then to top off the evening, we ended it with the sinful flourless chocolate cake. Everyone was so friendly and it was just a great evening all around. It's an expensive place to dine for just for special occasions I think it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food!! What could anyone ask for...? Our waiter ,William, was very friendly; he even interacted with my 1 year old son very well. I was very pleased. I've been to this location many times and I've never been disappointed, always a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"For special occasions,  I tend to gravitate towards  a juicy medium rare ribeye steak. Since it would be a lunch date,  my options dwindled down.  Terra,  Octagon, Hy's,  Opus and Jacob's were crossed off the list, taking us to Ruth Chris' at Richmond Street.  
The ambiance was okay,  it was a quiet lunch hour,  even on a Friday.  My ribeye was more medium well than rare.  It was flavourful but less juicy than I'd like it to be. Presentation of the food was less than stellar.  The steak was served sizzling on a white oval plate that looked like it's ready to retire.  For a nice steakhouse such as RC ,  I'd imagine my steak presented a bit better than this. The sides came in generous servings, we ordered mashed potatoes and creamy spinach.  Both were good,  but nothing spectacular.  My boyfriend ordered the NY striploin,  which was decent, but I've had better steaks. For the price,  I was expecting more. The only thing worth mentioning is the service.  The excellent service we received made up for the lack of lustre in food. Oh well,  at least I enjoyed my Chianti. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Perfection at the Madison locale.  A humorous and attentive server named Jung made it an enjoyable Saturday evening for a party of four.  My brother, a butcher of 40 years, said it was the best cowboy rib eye steak he had ever had.  I would concour, perfectly cooked to order and excessively large were the norm for the various cuts we ordered.  The house chopped salad was fresh tasting and each component stood out on their own.  The salad is topped with lightly deep fried onions that were crisp and not oily.  The potatoes au gratin were sizzling hot and while excellent, I would have preferred a sharper cheese in them and another minute under the salamader to brown the top, but they were fully cooked and piping hot.  The fresh Brussel sprouts were served in a bacon and honey sauce that was tasty and not over powering.  There was a very large portion of veg, but it let everyone share - even those who would normally turn their nose up at the thought of eating the little cabbages seemed to like them in the preparation presented!   A great dark red Zinfandel ($70) went well with the meal and after dinner drinks with creme brullee completed a leisurely dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Lots of expediters and others helping the servers, so it was seamless, professional and still one of my favorite places to dine.  The usual extensive wine lists, choices of water and formal dining service.  Have eaten at a number of other of Ruth's locations and am consistently impressed with the high quality, professional service and reasonable pricing for such an evening of entertainment. Entrees and sides are priced separately, which adds up for those afraid to open their wallet, but when you consider that you spend $125 for four hours of entertainment that leaves you sated, it is well worth.  The perfect place for a very special evening out or to celebrate a special event.  Kudos to their fine staff for making a special evening even more special for friends who had never had the chance to sample the cusine at a Ruth's.  Parking is in a private lot.  There is no valet parking and it was difficult to find a spot to park at 6:30 pm.  Handicapp parking is non-existant, but staff were very accommodating to a wheelchair bound diner, an expediter even escorting them to the bathroom and initially to their table.  Easy to maneuver and spacious, despite being very crowded on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"We went for drinks only. The hostess was great as she checked coats and sat us.
The atmosphere was great. The  dark-haired, glasses-wearing bartender was nice as he took the drink order for the 5 of us. He didn't write anything down. I don't have a problem with this as long as the order is filled correctly. Our party ordered  2 scotch rocks, a bourbon water, a dirty martini, and a gibson.
 The scotch and bourbon drinks were fine, but the martini and the gibson were very short pours. Maybe an ounce pour on each and this was after the vodka was poured from the strainer into the glass.  Also, the bartender put olives in the gibson, not onions!. He had to go back and get the onions.Nice presentation, but poorly executed. 
The bartender didn't apologize or offer to remedy the situation. I drank my bastardized gibson, but t these prices the expectations are a bit higher."}
{"text":"We recently visited the Ruth's Chris location in downtown Charlotte for a business dinner and meeting. The service was very good and could not have been better. The food, I.e. Steak was also very good, properly prepared, and generous in size. My only complaint, or issue with the meal was the items that came with the entrees. The mixed vegetables were only 'so-so', and the salad was of equal value and quality.

This is not intended to be a criticism of the evening, just that I think they could do better. With that I will only give them 4 stars, but I will go back, and will better prepared next time."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner and they overcooked my $57 steak not once, but twice! If this is a high quality steakhouse there is no reason the kitchen should have issues with meeting the customers request for their meat temperature. Why would I be given a nearly well done steak when I asked for medium? How does one mess this up TWICE? Extremely disapponting. I used to rave about this place but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wife loved her scallops, I thought my steak could have been better, I recall better from RC other locations in past. Good size portion on veggies. atmosphere so so. rating based on price and upscale expectations"}
{"text":"Back in the day, Ruth Chris had the sort of brand awareness and prestige that restaurants would die for.  With the saturation of steakhouses in the national market and the number of locally owned steakhouses in the Madison area, Ruth is just another cog in the giant steakhouse wheel.  It is just not that special anymore.
I will give credit that the steak I ordered (16 oz Ribeye) was cooked exactly to temperature (medium rare).  I thought the sides we ordered were fine (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, hash browns) but nothing were to write home about.  Service was fine although, as I was there for a business dinner, I felt the waitstaff didn't take advantage of the situation and be more consultative around wine for the table, sides, etc.  At entree price points in the $40's, the staff should be a little more polished.
Perhaps I would return for a happy hour as they have some attractive specials but with other steakhouses offering more exciting cuts of beef and delivering a more upscale experience, I can't say for certain that I will return for a dinner."}
{"text":"The must-eat for serious steakhouse enthusiasts. I've been made fun of for my love for the petite medallions (2 of 'em) and shrimp (Louisiana-style) on top, but there's nothing petite about my appetite, I kid you not. Put two of them together, and it's a luscious filet mignon meal. The cocktails are off the hook; and the delectable creamed spinach is an essential on the side. \"Ruth's Chris\" is one of those must-once-a-year occasions, it's expensive, but a necessary splurge for any true steak lover. Note: Don't get butter on your nose like I did; the waiter won't laugh at you but your friends will."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton and needed food, it was convenient to have a Ruth Chris located on site.  The service was excellent.  Steaks cooked perfect, delicious sides, salads and apps.  Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing service.  We were in last night and there was a problem with the gift card we were using.  Manager went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  Staff was excellent.  They went out of their way to recognize my son for his birthday.  Overall 5 star!!!"}
{"text":"Our first ever dinner to a Ruth's Chris, Middleton WI, was pleasant, with only a few disappointments. Our waiter, GUI, and his team were very attentive and helpful. We ordered from the Sunday Price Fixed menu with nicely portioned and delicious entrees of lightly crusted walleye and 6oz. Petite filet. The German Reisling was superb but the Arnold Palmer was mediocre. Salad greens  were fresh, but lemon basil creamy dressing was as uninspiring as salad itself. All plated foods were stark, lacking any garnish or embellishment, including dessert. Creamy spinach side was excellent. Our anniversary  was acknowledged by two tiny stick candles on a small butter plate, and silk rose petals at table center--rather unremarkable; we would have preferred nothing to this. The Irish coffee aperitif was just the right temperature and served with a flair of stirrer straws, perfect finish along with Petite Bananas Foster Cheesecake. The gas fireplace was broken and diminished the ambiance on a still cold WI night, despite our being seated to face it. Lynn M."}
{"text":"We came on a Sat with reservation, and waited for about twenty minutes. Our server was nice and friendly.  The steak arrived fast, but arrived lonely in a sizzling white plate; sitting there burning hot in the middle of a puddle of butter.  Our waitress reminded us again and again not to touch the plate.  I could feel the heat when I was cutting the steak. It's not hard to get a first degree burn if you touch the plate!! I had the rib eye; it's meaty and tender.  I ordered medium rare and it came in medium rare;seared and had a hint of red inside.  But it wasn't that marble tho.  Besides the red meat, we also had the potatoes au gratin and the creamed spinach.  The cheesy potatoes was delicious and the spinach was nice and creamy.  Honestly, i enjoyed the side over the steak."}
{"text":"Amazing views all around - no matter where you are seated. We had a little bit of a problem with the reservation but they were very kind and seated our party of 8 rather quickly. Chas was a wonderful and very attentive waiter. The petite filet mignon was PERFECT on 500 degree plates. The sweet potato casserole though - was LIFE CHANGING. Perfectly sweet, lots of crumblies on top and again - piping HOT as food should be ! Ruth's Chris never dissapoints and this was spot on."}
{"text":"we ate here on 11-06-14 around 7:30 pm.  we made reservations and had no problem being sat at our table.  our server Adam did a great job!  we answered all our questions and concerns.  he made an effort to check up on us often.  the ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic.  my wife was impressed.

for dinner we both ordered the ruth's classics.  i ordered the caesar salad, 16 oz ribeye (for an extra $4), and mashed potatoes.  my wife ordered the apple, walnut and bleu cheese salad for her starter.  and a 12 oz ribeye and green beans as a side.  the ribeyes were the reason why were were dining at RC to begin with.  when the kitchen staff brought us our meals it was screwed up.  i didn't bother trying to explain the mix up.  i waited for Adam, our server, and once he checked up on us he noticed too that our ribeyes were not on our plates.  he had all the food removed and brought out the correct order.  once we got our ribeyes they were good as usual.  enjoyed the size, tenderness, marbling, and flavor!  we both loved our chocolate turtle cheesecake with cranberry-pecan chocolate bark.

we both had a romantic evening and enjoyed the manager taking time to talk to us because he heard we were visiting from out of town.  cool!  our bill before tip was $130.  we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from Hawaii and my dad has a friend that works at this Ruth Chris location so we decided to stop in. We enjoyed our time, ordered a couple bottles of wine a few appitizers and I ordered the rib eye for my main entree. Sadly, I had to get it cooked 3 times for it to come out \"perfect.\" Totally my fault, because I feel absolutely totally uncorfortable sending back items due to me working in the food and bev industry. However, the staff was amazing and great great great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place to go let me share why.....

Went on a week night crowded but fully staffed and able to transition to a table or bar with ease. 

Durning my visit staff were attentive and friendly. They made recommendations and were knowledgeable. 

The food-It was fresh and tasted great. We ordered a variety of apps. The calamari which which had a sweet and spicy drizzle that paired well with it. The crab stack was served cold and mixed with fresh avocado in between it was served with a super spicy sauce. It wasn't my favorite but I appreciate the presentation and creative aspect to try something different. The blue crab cakes were yummy. They were nice and hot when we got them and tasted so good. You didn't even need the sauces it paired with. The stuffed mushrooms came in a set of three they were delicious. 

The bathrooms were spacious and clean. 

The drinks- I tried the coconut ginger lemon martini. This drink has a kick. I couldn't taste the coconut it was drowned out by the dominant flavors of the lemon and ginger. It will wake you up. The strawberry basil was my favorite. I will come back again just for that. It was refreshing. The rosemary cosmo was good as well. 

They have valet and a full parking lot behind the restaurant. Parking lot is currently free. 

I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Went there for birthday celebration! Great service! I had a filet with shrimp on top, creamed spinach and the clam chowder soup. Tasted wonderful but my eyelids began to swell before we left - next day I could hardly open my eyes. Had an allergic reaction to something. Scary!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday and the host seemed more than underwhelmed about sprinkling some birthday confetti on the table. I could have done without that and the card. Anyway, we started with the ahi tuna which was out of this world! The steaks were good but far from the best steak I've ever had. The au gratin potatoes were slightly undercooked. The garlic mashed were better. My husband had the restaurant week menu so he got the apple cheesecake for dessert, which was good. They offered me a birthday dessert on the house and I ordered creme brulee. When the bill came there was a charge for a birthday dessert at half price. When you're spending that kind of money, I'm not quibbling about the price, but I do think they need to learn what on the house means."}
{"text":"I like this place. Excellent food and the staff is very friendly. They accommodated all my requests"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte for business.  I wanted to eat a good piece of steak so i Yelp Steakhouses near bye.  There reviews were great, so we decided to give them a try. 6 miles and 15 minutes later we arrived.  The place was easy to find and there was a good atmosphere.  We ordered the Jordan wine and the food was amazing.  Would highly recommend this place to anyone that is near the airport."}
{"text":"Lovely this location.  Dave and Team do a great job and really work to make sure your food is right.  The Spinach and the Sea Bass are my favorite along with their wine selection.  Seem to always have very attractive and friendly female bartenders. 

What can I say?  My customers don't have to twist my arm.  Let's go!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Was in Scottsdale on biz and celebrated Valentines Day with another couple. The scallops were just right. The Chop Salad is the best in the nation, possible exception, the 1905 at Tampa's venerable Columbia. We split Sea Bass & a petite filet. I love the butter they cook the steak in. Asparagus & sweet potatoes along side. 4 forks to the Chocolate Sin Cake. Ask for Stu or Stacia, Cost? If you have to ask........"}
{"text":"Slightly expensive for the value that you really get. I spent around $65 for a ribeye steak, but it was drenched in so much butter that it made it taste so heavenly.

Drinks were refilled quickly and the server was very kind! I had a great experience at Ruth Chris' steak house! 

Come here if you want a decent steak and nice service!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my moms birthday here also came for regular dinner one night everything on the menu is awesome service is great also"}
{"text":"By far the best steak I've ever eaten! Absolutely worth the splurge, $50-$65 is a lot to spend on a piece of beef, but no other steak compares. Served sizzling hot (literally) in warm butter, it's melt-in-your-mouth goodness. We go here annually for my birthday with family and it's a really special tradition! This year I got the bone in tenderloin with a lobster tail and it was divine! You cannot not order the sweet potato casserole as a side and the asparagus with hollandaise was perfection, nothing bad to say about any of the side dishes. Again --- it will seem really expensive to have to pay for your side dishes, but 3 for our group of 4 was perfect. We had the mushroom caps and onion soup for appetizers and again, it did not disappoint. I had the creme brulee for dessert for the first time this year and I wanted to lick the bowl. Wasn't a fan of their banana cream pie last year, the crust is way too thick. This is the second year we've had Daniel as our server and he was fantastic. He had recommendations and knew the menu very very well. Thanks, Ruth's Chris Calgary!"}
{"text":"Came here 2 nights ago to celebrate my boyfriends new job & it was a perfect date night w/ amazing food & service. We had a 7:30 PM reservation, we checked in & they said it would be just a minute so we walked over to the bar to get a drink, as we were about to order, they called us over to be seated (so the wait time was less than 5 minutes). Our waiter (didn't catch his name) was great & very attentive. We both ordered cocktails -- I got a Raspberry Rosemary Cosmo & my he got a Dirty Goose Martini. Both were great. We split a Caesar salad, which was also very good & the perfect portions knowing we had a lot of food coming. For the Main Course -- I got the Surf & Turf special which was an 8oz filet with 2 lobster tails (YUM) & he got the Cowboy Ribeye. The two sides we got were the Potatoes Au Gratin & Crimini Mushrooms. Everything was delicious, if we came back I would get the same things again. We had a ton of leftovers, and no room for dessert :("}
{"text":"Had a meal here, and tried the roasted garlic and sun dried tomato steak fries.  They are so good also had a great Steak."}
{"text":"I remember eating here when it was called \"The Range\".   Since Ruth's Chris has taken over, it is even better.  Our service was as good as all of the other locations in the chain.  This is one of the best parts of dining with Ruth's Chris - the food and service are very consistent.

What makes this restaurant unique is the incredible view of Caesar's Palace across the street.  Be sure to get a reservation and ask / insist they seat you near the windows overlooking the strip.  You won't be disappointed.

The ambiance is very relaxed / romantic, the food is really amazing, and the service is great.  It's expensive, but I think the prices are fair considering its location on the Strip.

Tips:  Try the sweet potato casserole, and the bone-in filet."}
{"text":"Okay. So a bit disappointed in my visit, especially after all the rave I hear on the joint. The service was top notch. We had reservations at got seated within a few minutes.  Each person from host, wait staff, and manager were all very nice and professional. We definitely felt as we were attended to. (4.4/5)
The problem and deduction in rating was the food, unfortunately.  We each ordered the filet, medium well, and we ordered two sides to share. The filets came out sizzling hot and looked and smelled so good.  We cut into each and we noticed a huge difference. One was pretty red, and mine was, well, brown.  It was still edible and it is hard for me to send food back to any kitchen (we all know why there is anxiety sending food back.) when our waitress came back around I showed her the difference and she acknowledged that they were not cooked the same. She said it looked like one was underdone and the other a little over cooked. The manager did a round checking on tables as well. I let her know I was enjoying my meal, but did point out the difference.  She was surprised at the difference and offered to correct the mistake. I will admit, I did not ask for a correction.  But when we are paying $210 for two (2 filets, 2 sides total, and three glasses of wine total), it should really come out right the first time.  And since it didn't, a server or manager should try to make it right in another way as it should be known that some guests are not comfortable sending food back.  Maybe comp a slice of cake? Or not charge for one of the filets....just saying. Service was good good, food was blah, issue resolution skills could use some improvement. Unfortunately, at this price, I'm unsure to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first Ruth Chris experience yesterday and it was absolutely wonderful! We are from NY and have been to many upscale steak houses and this by far was the best experience. The hostesses we're extremely friendly when we checked into our reservation. Since it was our anniversary they put rose petals on our table and gave us complimentary dessert. The food was beyond this world. Cooked exactly how we requested with so much flavor. Lastly, our waiter Johnny was terrific to say the least! He was personable, absolutely hysterical and knowledgeable on every item on the menu! Any establishment is better when you have service like this! Thank you Johnny for a fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"I'm on the verge of tears.  This steak is making me sad that I cannot have an infinite hunger. The filet mignon tastes like butter on a hot day on top of a black car sitting in the desert. I feel like I need to be a preacher so that I can spread the word of this steak. I've even been to the Ruth's Chris is Beverly Hills numerous times but this Vegas one is ridiculous. Must come here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for quality steaks I have found since moving to the Valley 6 years ago.  We've been there a few times and I have to say.....

Service...great
Menu options....great
Steaks....FANTASTIC!
Price... a little high but worth the $ IMO. 

If you haven't been... go... it's worth a visit.

{"text":"I've been several Ruth's locations and this is defiantly my second favorite location. It doesn't like look like much when you see it from the outside but when you are inside it looks like a totally different place. They have outdoor seating which is great for those lovely Arizona nights. The ambiance inside is very romantic which I always appreciate in a restaurant such a Ruth's. The staff here are all really nice and the service here was really quick. The food was amazing as always and was 100% satisfied. I love Ruth's steakhouses and I would definitely come back to this location if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Before I start, I want to say that they are offering me a recovery dinner to make up for the terrible experience I had, so I will be updating my review once I go back. Let me just jump right into it, the service was horrible and I hate to say that but it was just really god-awful... our server never checked up on us and constantly forgot to put in the things we ordered; the only good part about the service was the nice lady who gave us our bread, she was more attentive than our own server. For dinner, we ordered the Tomahawk for the table as a shareable dish due to its size. It comes out and our waitress asked if we would like for her to cut it up so we oblige, thinking that she knows what she's doing... boy, were we wrong. She gave each of us 2 pieces, a large block-like chunk and then a small sliver of fat for each of us, coming out to 6 pieces total. She completely butchered the steak! The way it was suppose to be served was in thin slices so each of us could grab as we pleased. When we called back to let the manager know, he said she should have never touched the steak and that they are specifically told not to do this. He was nice enough to offer us a recovery dinner so we will be back. We've been to Ruth Chris before, so we know this isn't how a typical experience goes but I figured I'd write about it anyways."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu at Ruth's Chris in Scottsdale. Burger, steak sandwich and spicy shrimp all great and very affordably priced.  Drinks for $9 and beer for half that!  Our waitress was only OK a she forgot a salad (too late once all the entres showed up), and then she included an extra drink on the bill that we didn't order, but maybe she was just having a tough start to her shift.  Previously the waitstaff has been great here.  Not terribly impressed with the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Dear manager,

Please please please for the love of god (and as a matter of life or death) PLEASE hire at lease ONE person on duty (a server, manager, even an assistant manager, hostess, chef, bus boy, bartender) or ANYONE who has learned how to perform The Heimlich maneuver on a person who starts choking while at your venue. My family visited your restaurant for a birthday dinner and after one bite of a lamp chop he began choking and standing up to beg for help! His mother yelled for someone to please help us and call 911 while his brother attempted to help but he couldnt dislodge the meat. NOT ONE EMPLOYEE came to help administer the Heimlich maneuver and he was choking for over a minute! Thank God a Hero and good samaritan sitting at the table behind us came to his rescue and  after using Heimlich multiple times the food was projected out! I even gave him an EPI pen shot to be sure he was saved. We had informed our server of his seafood allergy so I hope to god this was not the reason he choked and All that matters is he is alive - (no thanks to the employees at Ruth Chris!) I don't care if its a legal requirement or not, there should always be someone on duty working INSIDE the restaurant who could have helped! Not to mention they didn't even apologize  that the birthday was ruined but they didn't even ask if he was OK when the paramedics arrived! I expected more from a worldwide restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday evening, within the first 5 minutes we were thinking about leaving, the young ladies at the host desk were not very welcoming and seemed to lack organization. However, we decided to keep our reservation. As the evening progressed all became a lot better thanks to the great service from Crystal and the very good meal. The presentation was awesome, as one who wants my food to always stay warm, the service of sizzling food on hot hot plates was great, up until the last morsel I was able turn my food side to side and still enjoy a warm piece of sea bass."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the view of the restaurant from the parking lot is a bit saddening and the red carpet to the elevator is pretty tacky. But the real star here is the food! If you want a good deal, come during AZ Restaurant Week for a 3 course meal. The roasted tomato & crab soup had a little kick to it that elevated the dish. Their steaks are very flavorful, most likely stemming from the fact that they're cooked in butter. We tried their filet mignon and petite ribeye, both of which were delicious. Their sides are normal, nothing to complain about here. I prefer this place over Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Overall great experience at a fine Vegas steak house.

Our server was actually pretty chatty, discussing the cold streak in the Midwest.  I had the basic filet, medium rare.  It was a 2-inch thick piece of perfection.  Nice and warm all the way through, but good and red center.

Sides of asparagus and broccoli were good but not great.

Wine selection was nice and broad, with cheapest bottle around $40."}
{"text":"Definitely pricey, but the Ribeye was one of the best I've ever had. Plus, the place has a great atmosphere with a nice view of the strip right across from the forum shops. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a nice, classy place!"}
{"text":"Just look at the photo of my leftover $125 dinner entree.   (I left the soft fat on the plate in the pool of grease.)  Very slow service, the girls down at the end suggested it might be because they wanted to sell more drinks first.  Very salty and fatty soup to start. Far too much sweet dressing on the otherwise very nice salad.   
$20 mandatory tip on my $95 Jubilation menu.
Never again.


My leftover entree - $125 with mandatory 25% tip and tax (Jubilation menu.) I left the soft fat on the plate in the pool of grease."}
{"text":"I would recommend to check this place, especially if it comes to a special occasion.
Visited there in last November. 

I'm not a huge carnivor, and I could do really good with small amounts of meat, so for the meat fans among you, I assume that you might love it. 

The restaurant feels very fancy and elegant. 
I remember that it was a little bit too dark inside the restaurant. 
Our waiter was super nice, and made sure we were comfortable. 

I had a fillet mignon and a sweet potato casserole and it was delicious. 

The meal sizes are not huge, but the sizes are exactly what you need to keep your belly happy. 
It's a little bit pricey, but I think it's worth the money, since it's a very good quality food. 
And also the meat, again I am not a big fan of steaks, but for me, the fillet mignon was just enough. 

We had a chocolate - espresso cake and it was OK. Maybe espresso lovers would find it good. 

Overall, I enjoyed the experience, and might come back in another occasion, or with more meat fans friends."}
{"text":"Let me start by first saying this place is a 5 star restaurant. I rarely give 5 stars because I'm such a hard critic but this place deserves it. The only reason I took a star off is because one of the waiters, Chris, accidentally backed into another waiter carrying an entire platter of plates and wine glasses and she dropped it right beside my table. No big deal right? Accidents happen, BUT apparently a piece of glass landed in my Moms chair and when she was about to get up to use the restroom it CUT her and yes she was bleeding. Of course it was a complete accident and when I got the bill he removed her steak from the bill, but I feel her entire meal and sides should've been free. 

Now on to the actual food review, I have been to a lot of steak places in my life, and before hand id say Flemings had the best steak I've ever tasted in Charlotte, but not anymore. I ordered the ribeye and let me tell you, it was cooked PERFECTLY. I eat all my steaks well done and the ribeye literally made u want to throw the entire thing, still sizzling from the oven, into your mouth lol. Lawd, I can't say enough about it, very flavorful. Now the sides were also very good. PLEASE NOTE, the sides are large, and are big enough for definitely 2, maybe even 3 people if you're not greedy like me, so you really should share with whoever you come with to save money. The sweet potato casserole was also the BEST I've ever had in my life, and I mean Anywhere! The corn, was very good also, the broccoli was nothing special (but then again when is it ever? Lol).  It wasn't mushy and not too hard, it was perfect. 

Now to the \"bad\", I tasted my sister crab cakes she ordered and those were VERY mushy. I mean I almost felt like I was eating baby food. If they could've been a bit crispier or broiled longer they would've been much better. 

Also, I wish I didn't have to remind the waiters to refill our water, because our cups were about empty before I pulled someone to the side, but hey maybe Chris was busy? The food is very expensive though so it's best for special occasions. Overall this is a 5 star restaurant, just wish I could've changed a few things at the end."}
{"text":"Hubs and I rolled up to the valet and were pleasantly surprised by how outgoing and friendly they were and the free service. Even better, at the end of your meal, the server has your car brought around so you don't have to wait. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and told by the apologetic manager there was a minor delay in seating us...turns out, when the reservation was made, they asked if this dinner was a celebration (our anniversary) and asked our favorite drinks- the delay was getting those drinks on the table fresh from the bar. NICE touch RC!

Our British waiter was wonderful, sharing the background of RC and offering advice on certain dishes after inquiring as to our preferences. We both had steak. Sizziling, fork tender, delicious steak. Cooked to perfection. A perfect cut. My husband loooved the creamed spinach, I enjoyed the potatoes (my hips, maybe notsomuch). Our glasses were never empty. Empty dishes never lingered....and ya, they were empty b/c we pretty much scarfed down everything.

I'm very fortunate, I've dined at some of the country's best establishments and I can honestly say RC holds it's own in service and food in a more comfortable, inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. On business travel, I dined alone and due to the larger portion of the regular sides... I chose to have one of the Ruth's Classics (a bundled meal). The person waiting on me looked visibly disappointed that I went this route. Umm... sorry, I guess?

They asked if I'd like wine with my dinner and being a non drinker, I politely declined. The wait person looked, again, visibly disappointed. Umm... sorry, I guess?

Then an assistant wait staff member came with water choices and asked if I would like still or sparkling... and I politely declined again and looking somewhat disappointed (but less than the main wait person) they said, \"Ok, here's tap water for you\", poured and walked away.

I was done with my meal and they didn't bring out my dessert, but brought me my bill. No biggie, I guess no dessert (I don't need the calories), but the main wait person caught it and brought me my dessert after all, and asked if I would like coffee or a cappuccino with it. I was pushing 9pm and being somewhat sensitive to caffeine at night, I politely declined. Yup, you've guessed it... the wait person was again visibly disappointed. Umm... really sorry, I guess?

If you want a \"disappointing\" experience go to this Ruth's Chris and do what I did. It's got to be all my fault. All the other Ruth's Chris Steak Houses do table touches by the manager on duty and make their patrons feel welcomed, but not so much here at the Middleton location.

Who knows, if you are a high ticket customer and go for the all out experience with wine, regular menu items, full on desserts, and coffee perhaps you will be able to please the team at this location.

Best wishes and good luck. In all, I probably won't be back only because the \"medium\" steak that was ordered appeared to be boiled and not broiled nor grilled and really didn't do it for me. I will be back to Ruth's, probably just not to this one.

Meh... wa~wa~... yawn... about sums it up."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris seemed fitting to end my husband's and my 1-year wedding anniversary trip to Vegas. It's a dark, intimate and cozy space with impeccable service from Miguel, who take care of us. Their booths offer a great deal of seclusion - in fact, each booth is separated from the next with frosted glass. I kinda liked how they kept referring us to us as \"Mr and Mrs..\", by our last names :)

When asked how I wanted my filet mignon cooked, I opted for medium well but Miguel recommended I order \"medium plus,\" which is their own specal category between medium and medium well). It was perfect! My steak was just over the brink of being completely cooked, yet it was still juicy. My husband's ribeye was equally tender. It's sort of an odd obervsation, but I love their hollandaise sauce. The steaks were flavorful enough that they didn't need it, but it was a nice addition.

The only complaint I had was about the bread. Our order of garlic cheese bread apeared to be (and tasted like) a baguette with melted American cheese. *shrug*"}
{"text":"We're not particularly steakhouse people, but when we have time to get out, we know we can't do better than Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in South Park. General Manager Kenneth Pace and Manager Kristy Lathan are the greatest! We also love Elaine, Ben.  gosh, can't name them all. Just a wonderful group who treat us and our senior dogs like royalty. The master chef has even sent out complimentary plates of carefully chopped steak at times. I wish we could get there more often, but life has a way of \"getting in the way\"."}
{"text":"I was able to get a discount because my reservation was accompanied by a show. The total cost of my meal was $70 but it only ended on $20 as part of the deal.  The food was great and the service was even better. If your visiting Las Vegas I highly recommend eating at this fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"The food and the ambiance was fantastic! Went for my boyfriends birthday and everyone made an effort to stop by our table and wish him a happy birthday. It made it really special. The food was a 4 out 5. Everything was very good but for our bill total it wasn't the best meal I ever had. Still really pleased and would come back!"}
{"text":"Came here casually dressed.  Was a clean and dim atmosphere.  We waited about 35 minutes to be seated.  I ordered the lamb chops with a wedge salad.  The lamb chops were seasoned PERFECTLY.  I would definitely order them again.  The wedge salad was basically half a head of lettuce...this is fine because it is a wedge salad after all...but you will likely have to ask for more dressing to cover the big gaudy wedge.  The waiter did fairly well...he was really running around a lot and it was hard to get his attention.  When it came time to pay the bill he forgot to give us a pen to sign with...we had to wait a little while until he finished running around (literally running) to get his attention for the pen.  No biggie though.  I took off two stars because the prices are nearly double what I have paid at Ruth Chris in other locations.  I understand it is Vegas and on the strip but I still have to deduct a few points for that.  If I had the extra money to spare and really had a taste for lamb chops, I would visit again."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving here and although the food was good, the service was very disappointing.  It took a long time to get drinks and never were we asked if we wanted another round to have with our meals. Our food was dropped off and no one came back to ask if had everything we needed or how it was.  We asked for coffee and the servers acted annoyed.  To top it off, the holiday menu states they will send you home with leftovers and we recieved nothing. Very sad experience for a holiday meal."}
{"text":"This is the second time I went to this place. The first time for my birthday and the second time for my BFF birthday. What can I say I'm a fan. The steaks are cooked to perfection and their side dishes are to die for. Remember to leave room for dessert as it was awesome. For my birthday I had the cheesecake and for the second time we had apple crumble with vanilla ice.
But the one thing that I have to tell what is it with the dark? I do like the atmosphere but I have a hard time seeing things.
The staff was excellent with awesome knowledge and also were able to tell you it's histoy."}
{"text":"I'll never visit a Ruth's Chris again!  Went here for a boyf bday then Morton's for the bro's bday, no no don't be silly not all in one night!  Everything about Morton's was better, the food, the service, the atmosphere, ESPECIALLY the atmosphere!  And, the price tag at Ruth's Chris, so not worth it!  Buy yourself some organic grass-fed beef and grill it yourself, I'm telling you, totally way better!!!"}
{"text":"Came for our anniversary worst dinner ever out of four dishes the drink was the best. Waked 10 minutes to get drinks. Not coming back. Steak $75 was chewy at best. No dress code, loud, disappointing"}
{"text":"Probably just north of 3 stars, but rounded up for the excellent service.  

We got here a bit early for an 8 o clock reservation and decided to hit the bar area.  Be warned, it's not a huge bar area- only 3 tables or so and maybe 10 stools at the bar.  The wait staff there was excellent.  I ordered a pretty simple Hendrick's & Tonic (any place that carries Hendrick's is alright with me), but my friend ordered a specialized drink of 1 part Hendrick's & 2 part Ketel one, shaken, no garnish, with half poured and the other half chilled in a shot glass sitting in a tumbler of ice water.  SHEESH, talk about high maintenance, but they gladly made it and made it to a T.  

The steaks themselves were ok.  For the price you pay (~$40 for my bone-in ribeye), you can get a better steak just down the street at Donovan's.  Also, they don't serve any complimentary sides or anything with the steak, unless you order them.  It's just the steak on a plate of sizzling butter.  Quite gluttonous.  

I did save a little room for dessert.  I split a flourless chocolate cake with a hint of espresso and a strawberry drizzle.  It was absolutely awesome, and probably the best part of the meal, which, for a steakhouse, probably isn't a rousing endorsement."}
{"text":"Oh, the Ruth's Chris steakhouse chain. Each restaurant is a different animal depending on where you are. It's first-rate in NYC and Washington DC, on a par with Mortons and Peter Lugers; but it's downright folksy out here in the Midwest. It puzzled me to see that they wore flare. I guess impersonating TGI Friday's employees is their way of trying not to intimidate the dairy farmers and college students that define the area.

Service was good, and the food was good too. But it's not a high-dazzler as steak places go. There aren't any of those in Madison - not really. Johnny Delmonico's is about as close as you're going to get to The Real Thing."}
{"text":"Yum. Truly great steakhouse. Came here for Charlotte restaurant week and was not disappointed. I opted for the $45 ribeye with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans, mushroom soup and cheese cake for dessert. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. Be prepared for butter on everything, but of course that just makes everything taste better!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our evening with great food.  Steaks were fabulous, but be ready to drop some money.  Not a place we'll visit often, but it was a special occasion and the whole staff was outstanding.  Our waitress Nancy who was originally from our area, she
 recognized some local landmarks and it was fun to chat.  Celebrated my birthday and my sister and brother-in-laws 49th wedding anniversary.  Everyone made it a very special evening!   Highly recommend you visit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service. Ask for Jeff. He took excellent care of my wife and I on our anniversary and even went and got her some vanilla ice cream when that was all she could think of for dessert."}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed with this place at all.   Food was just okay.   I'm okay with paying higher prices for quality food but nothing about the food here wowed me.   Service was also just okay as well.  Our first drinks took a while even though they weren't very busy.    Plates weren't removed from the table in a timely manner.   I'd much rather goto Flemings or capital grill if I'm going to high end chain steakhouse"}
{"text":"The view here is spectacular. It faces the strip & Caesers Palace. 

Our server told us at the end of our dinner that they were not expecting such a large amount of people dining there that day so they weren't meeting a lot of expectations. However, our party thought everything went very well! If that was a bad night for them, I can't imagine how much more amazing they could be on a regular day!

I ordered the lamb chops (3 THICK pieces of lamb) on a 500 degree sizzling plate. Ugh it was so delicious that my mouth is watering as I am typing. My boyfriend ordered the cowboy bone-in rib eye steak and that was also very tasty. Both of our meats were cooked perfectly medium rare as requested. We shared three sides with our friends which is perfect! If you go with a large party, definitely consider sharing your sides so that you all can try a little bit of everything! 

Calamari: I feel like this appetizer is a must everywhere I go but this one is by far one of the best I've had. Squeeze as much lemon as you want. The more the better IMO!

Lobster mac & cheese: extra cheesy and a piece of lobster in every bite almost.

Sweet potato casserole: I feel like we can do without. It was very sweet that day. I've had it before at another location and I thought it was delicious. However, I regret ordering this one on that day. 

Blackberry sidecar: Very strong but the flavor is still pretty good for how strong it was.

For our friend's birthday, they gave him a slice of cheesecake on the house.

Please check their website for proper dress code. It isn't that strict, but you might want to check before you arrive just in case!"}
{"text":"This is my first attempt at writing a review as I'm eating, which is maybe that's the best compliment I can give; this place has motivated me to provide my real-time opinion. So far, everything has been excellent. The spicy lobster and seared ahi tuna appetizers are two cant-go-wrong selections. 

(And so much for my real time opinion, which may be the \"second\" best compliment I can give. When my steak arrived my primal instincts switched to EAT and my opinion took a back seat.) 

So now here I am several days later and I'm still completely impressed with this meal. I've known about Ruth's Chris for a long time and have heard nothing but great things but honestly because it's a chain, I sort of shrugged it off. I'm just more of a hidden gem kind of guy. Thankfully I ventured out of my box and into the private elevator at Harrah's that leads to the beautiful view belonging to Ruth's Chris. Unfortunately, we didn't get to soak in the view but that was actually fine with me. We showed up with no reservations during a busy March Madness weekend and were able to sit and eat immediately at the bar, which was great (bartenders always make the best servers.) After finishing our appetizers, I had a baked potato, the bone-in New York steak (a.k.a. \"The distraction\") and the banana cream pie. The baked potato was standard but the steak was amazing and big enough to feed two, easy. The banana cream pie, unlike the potato, was far from standard and is a must try for banana cream and non-banana cream fans alike. I'm a huge fan but my brother is not and we both loved it.

Try it or Diet Final Word

There is no dieting on this one. Must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Yes, RC is expensive but you absolutely get what you pay for. Outstanding and personalized attention from your server, delicious food and an upscale setting. This was my birthday dinner and it was worth every penny! Not for regular dining - unless you're RICH - but definitely a must do for special occasions. It's fun for me and my Boo to get dressed up and go out. We work hard and we deserve it!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at Ruth Chris's since the 1990s. Never an issue.   Tonight we tried the highly touted $9 Happy Hour.  The steak sandwich was served on a 6\" sub role with about 6-7 thin slices of filet.  it was all bread. The béarnaise was COLD and the steak cooked WELL  (I ordered it medium).  Two others at our table ordered the prime rib burger-same problem served WELL not medium as we ordered. I didn't want to complain as it was a graduation celebration and no need for negative vibes. The highlight were the French fries, sad, because this is a steak house.......it was more like a sports bar quality."}
{"text":"Nice evening. Jeff was wonderful server. Food delicious. Steak cooked perfectly, side dishes and drinks great !"}
{"text":"We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.

Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice. 

The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.

Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!

I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"This is a old school steakhouse chain. Good steaks and a very dark wood atmosphere. First time I went here about ten years ago, I was impressed.  However, it is really starting to feel out of step with today's more modern restaurants.

The steaks are still good, although I think not much better than what you can cook at home if you have a BBQ and a good cut of quality meat.

Not sure if I would recommend it given the price/experience/quality balance. It is pricey but decent."}
{"text":"This was the first, and only time I've been to a Ruth Chris.
This location is open pretty late..

I tried the filet mignon, and well.. it was just OK.. It lacked seasoning, and flavor. Yes there was hot butter on the plate.   It wasn't as good as I expected. Yes it was prime beef, and tender, and juicy... but I can have comparable steaks elsewhere for less.   None of the desserts looked that good.  

We came casually dressed, and so did alot of others.. This is vegas baby!

If I want to try a REAL good steak..  I will try CUT in the Palazzo.. or somewhere else."}
{"text":"Porterhouse for two for $108 served with some shrimp on top for an extra $16 made for a splurge meal while in town.  Served on a 500 degree plate and came out sizzling.  Porthouse combined the filet and the strip. I preferred the filet but with such a huge piece of meat there was definitely enough to have both!  We started with the crab corn chowder which was fantastic and also had the creamed spinach.  The bread left a lot to be desired which was fine for us being that we didn't want to fill up on bread but was somewhat disappointing.  If you want good bread go to Mon Ami Gabi.  The service was attentive but for the price it was hard to get too excited about this."}
{"text":"They got their star back........it was the wait staff that did the honor of making me \"want\" to give them back another stat........for this particular business lunch we had Christopher as our waiter......enagaging and funny...just laid back and did a great job of doing his job.

I had the Steak Frites....medium rare.  Yum Yum.  As the plate is lowered in front of me, the 1500 degree plate sizzles the fat dripping off the slice of meat.  This is the best way to serve a good steak and I adore the way RC does it."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're looking for a great steak! They sear the steaks in butter and I have to say it tastes amazing. Although the prices are high, I feel it is worth it due to the quality and unmatchable tastes they provide. 
Generally speaking it has turned more into a \"date spot\" as what it used to be; a classy Steak House. 

I consider it  \"The Keg 2.0\"."}
{"text":"We had our diamond dinner and wanted to try Ruth Chris. From the minute we sat down, Dollianne made us feel like we were the most important people in the room. She made a custom dinner to our taste. This was the best night out I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. The ambience was beautiful,  our server was welcoming and warm and the service was impeccable. Unfortunately,  the food was not good (or at least mine wasn't). In all fairness,  I didnt have much of an appetite after eating at Harrahs hotel buffet earlier that afternoon,  so I wasn't in the mood for a heavy steak. The waitress suggested the scallops as it was a fairly small portion. My husband who was actually starving ordered the stuffed chicken and thought it was pretty good,  but my scallops arrived and after one bite,  I immediately spit them out because it was extremely SALTY. Our server immediately tried to rectify the situation and offered to make them again or order something else on the menu,  but by this time,  I had already eaten about half the sweet potato casserole and a good portion of the creamed spinach,  both which were delicious by the way,  so I declined and she was gracious enough to take them off the bill.  Overall,  I would probably not try this restaurant again,  it's pricey and we weren't super impressed,  but maybe we just caught them on a bad day...who knows."}
{"text":"Always excellent service at this location and the private dining rooms are always fun, the happy hour and bar area are great, if the weather is nice you can sit outside by the fireplace. I highly recommend the butterfly shrimp appetizer on happy hour."}
{"text":"Never disappointed and their bone in rib-eye is their signature steak. No corkage fee!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ruth's Chris really hit it out of the park. Seriously, there's a lot of steakhouses in Cleveland, but I think my steak from Ruth's was one of the best I've had in the city. Immediately when I entered, I had a positive impression that this restaurant was polished, friendly and set high standards. I love Mike K's comment that the atmosphere is very classy and quiet-- this is true. Quiet is my happy place. They also have a gorgeous private room upstairs adorned with chandeliers and spacious seating.

I have so many great things to say about this steak house. My friend and I started with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and rich without being overpowering. My petite filet (the 8 oz steak) had a fantastic seasoning to it (I was so full afterward). Our server was knowledgeable about accompanying wines, which by the way, are offered in great selection. In general, our service was outstanding, and when the manager came by to see how everything was, I felt he was genuinely interested in us. I'm looking forward to coming back this weekend for Mother's Day brunch. I'm happy Ruth's made the jump into 200 Public Square-- a building I love and want to see flourish!"}
{"text":"The best steak on the planet!  I have never had a better meal.  A bit pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for our anniversary, and we'd heard the hype, so we decided to try it. I ordered the filet, and it was a bit dry--I admit, it was probably cooked the way I ordered it, but it was dry regardless. My husband ordered the ribeye, and on his first bite, he bit into a piece of bone! I literally heard the crunch, and this is supposed to be a boneless ribeye! He hurt his tooth, and told our waitress when she came by. She informed the manager, who came out to speak to us. My husband showed him the piece of bone, and he offered to prepare him another steak. He declined, since we had a show that night and didn't have time to wait. My husband kept eating it, but he didn't really get to enjoy it, as he was worried about it happening again. When we got the bill, we were a bit disappointed to see there was not even a little bit of discount offered for that. My husband left a note on the back of the receipt, expressing his disappointment, and the manager ended up calling us. He told my husband he had planned to take the price of the steak off the tab but hadn't had a chance to relay that to our waitress. He told him he'd see two transactions on his bank account: the original dinner bill and the refund of the steak. Never happened. For a restaurant so high dollar, you'd think they could do better. The food was decent but due to the service, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Since my last review,  Ruth's Chris invited my husband and I back for a \"recertification\" of their restaurant.   Mama always said..NEVER turn down a free meal.  Fergus is an excellent waiter.  Request him, you will not be disappointed in the service.  Calamari..was delicious as was the salad.  Lobster and filet was cooked correctly.  We had the chocolate sin cake for dessert.  To die for.  The GM served our meal and once again there was a problem with my husband's steak.  He order medium.  It came rare.  Really rare.  GM was watching the table and whisked it away.  My husband would have eaten it without complaint.  I give them an A+ for effort.   I'm sure the kitchen got an earfull.  Fergus was very embarrassed.  Will we be back...of course, not. The main reason is the flavor of the steaks.  Or lack of.  I have tasted more flavorable steaks at Logans. They have some kitchen clean up to do but if we're going to spend $200 on a meal, we'll be going back to Flemmings."}
{"text":"Talk about a nice dining experience, this was just beyond words. I loved my entire visit here. I give all components of this review 5 stars: Atmosphere, Location, Service, Presentation, and Product! I visit Ruth's Chris when I visit a city, and  now I have one locally, as well. I'm never disappointed by a visit to any location. 
I'll start my review by delineating all components. 
Atmosphere: located in the Harrah's casino second floor via elevator access only. As you step off the elevator, you're immediately greeted by the hostess station and a divine view of Las Vegas Blvd. If your visit is st night, as mine was, you have access to the beautiful glittering lights along the Blvd. My table was located to allow a perfect view of Caesar's Palace. It was stunning. 
Location: centrally located on LVBlvd, in a very fun part of the strip. Lots of casinos and activities are in this area. 
Service: exceptional- everything you expect and then some. 
Presentation: the meal looks as if it's art on a photo shoot. No detail is spared. 
Product: the food was amazing. Packed with flavor, hot, seasoned, sautéed and sauced to perfection. Moist and tender where need be, crisp with a crunch as described, melt in your mouth goodness. 

All 5 areas made this dining experience a clear 5 star rating. I love a brand that delivers in all areas."}
{"text":"Not at all the normal experience of a Ruth's Chris. Prices are higher but food & service did not meet standards. They also do not accept their own coupon or specials (at least not the one that came from an email they sent me the previous day)."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great cocktails, Great Service. Spicy lobster for app was good. Steaks were amazing and the banana cream pie dessert was to die for! Our server Tom was attentive and met all our needs."}
{"text":"We ventured here for restaurant week. After visiting Mortons last restaurant week this January, we decided to try Ruth Chris. The ambience was less than spectacular, and the service subpar. Not rude, just not what's expected. It may be restaurant week, but nothing should tier down because of that. The steaks were cooked properly, and the sides were good. Dessert was alright, but to be honest we were full at that point. The experience wasn't terrible, but not great. With other chop houses in Charlotte, we won't be visiting Ruth Chris again."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Filet was a bit small but came with enough shrimp to compliment it. Calamari appetizer was a huge hit. Something with the batter! Chocolate gnache dessert is HUGE. One is more than enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"My mom and I frequent this location for various excuses to celebrate (or just eat/drink too much)...always a nice treat. It is a tad fancy-shmancy but the service is always on point and the food is cream of the crop. 

I love a good steak don't get me wrong but the item I get most excited about across the Ruth's Chris chain is the chopped salad to start. All day. Start your meal off right. Trust."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last night, and it was fantastic.  The food was amazing.  I love food to an inordinate degree, and this was the top of the line of things I've had.  The crab cake was amazing, the sides delicious, and the whiskey bread pudding was a sensational way to top it all off.  They know how to cook steaks just right and they surround them with fantastic compliments.  

The service is also wonderful.  It is up-scale without being stodgy.  Our waitress (Heather) and all the other servers were attentive, helpful, and personable.  There was a snafu with the computer system that night, meaning that credit cards weren't working reliably, and they handled it gracefully and friendly.  We will definitely be coming back here time and again."}
{"text":"This was best steak I've ever had. I got a deal for dinner on travelzoo, so I decided to eat here before I went to Beatles love, btw Love is a must see show. My deal was for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 side, 1 dessert, and a bottle of wine for $119 plus tip. It was worth it. If I didn't have the deal I would not get that much food but everything I had was good. The steak was so tender and flavorful. For my appetizer we got spicy lobster. I don't generally eat lobster but I tried it and I liked it. The spicy sauce was really good on it. Our side was mashed potatoes. One is definitely large enough to share. Also I have to have potatoes when I have steak. The potatoes were thick and not lumpy and garlic and buttery. The dessert was the chocolate explosion. It was good but I was stuffed at this point. I would totally go back but one thing to remember is that they have a dress code that is enforced, so don't try to come in a t shirt."}
{"text":"Just plain good... Great food and service and you can't get better than that. A group of friends and family went for my friends Lea's birthday and it was the perfect place. The Cowboy steak was amazing and I loved the sweet potato. ... Yum"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner at Ruth Chris Steak House after I finished the rock n roll half marathon.  They offered 20% off for runners which we didn't know about until we got there, which was awesome! We had great service, and the steaks were delicious.  The views from the dining room were beautiful, great view of the strip and of the race finish line.  We went here for a special dinner, so I think we would save this place for special occasions because it is pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour at the bar with a group of ladies celebrating a birthday. Johnny was  really a one of a kind waiter, he took great care of us as if we were his own family and friends! We enjoyed a few of their delicious Blackberry Sidecars (my fav), chopped salads, Seared Ahi Tuna App, and Spicy Shrimp App. We devoured every last bite! Oh, and of course we did the creme brûlée for dessert! Ruth's Chris always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Really fancy place. The food was well prepared. They made sure our water was always filled."}
{"text":"Probably the 2nd best steak I've had. The food is expensive, sure, but thats what you are there for. This is first date, anniversary, birthday type spot. It is a chain yes, and there are probably 'local' spots that I would rather frequent, however you can't deny the quality of the steaks. 

The cocktails, wine and drinks have always been solid. I had an amazing Gin Martini with blue cheese olives, a cab with my steak, and an Irish Coffee paired with my bread pudding desert. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Had a really nice Thanksgiving dinner here. It was awesome that they were open for one, and the food and service were very good. I had the filet, my wife had the prefix Thanksgiving dinner, and we each had a couple of drinks. I finished the meal off with some amazing Creme Brûlée. 

It's not the absolute best steak I've ever had, nor are they the best sides, but it's a really, really solid meal, and the drinks were impeccable. I personally feel like their 500 degree plates take a medium rare steak and turn it into near medium when you're about halfway through it. I almost wished I'd ordered it rare or rare+.

All told, I'd rather go to Flemings or City Hall, but Ruth's Chris is also a very good option, and you won't be disappointed in your meal."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I decided on Ruth's Chris for lunch to celebrate receiving our first paycheck. We work less than a block away. We set our reservation online and were quite pleased with the table setting / private room that awaited us. Marvin introduced himself as our server and he was amazing: great service, impeccable recommendations and great humor. We loved him. The food was excellent. Most of us ordered from the lunch menu (a great deal) and got the hamburger. But I ordered the stuffed chicken for a buck more (no pun intended)' and it was the best chicken I ever had. Period. We would like to turn it into a once a month thing at minimum. Excellent food and service and reasonable lunch prices for the quality. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok let me start from saying that my boyfriend and I had the worst experience ever. First of all it was my boyfriends 45th birthday. I made a reservation for March 28th at 8:30. My boyfriend was so excited and happy and told the hostesses that it was his Birthday and none of them even said \" Happy Birthday\". Then we were prompted to our table. The table was unstable and was shaking. We didn't say anything. Then it took a while for a bus person to bring us water I would say 15-20 minutes. At that point we haven't even seen our waiter. We finished water, our bread and the waiter still didn't show up. Nobody refilled our water, we even spilled one glass because the table was shaking and nobody even noticed. Then we asked a bus person to call a waiter for us and still nothing. Then we asked a photographer to call a manager. The manager came his name was Anthony he apologized and said he would take care of us. By the way when manager came our waiter showed up after 30 minutes; at that point we told him we didn't need him. So it took them 30 minutes to take our order. And guess what after the manager took our order, the food came out and the order was wrong. And we were for real now? Even the manager can't take an order at such expensive and high-end restaurant? He took our order and it was wrong!!!! If you charge customers high $$$$ please provide a good customer service. And make sure your managers know what they are doing and not just the name \"a manager\". There are plenty fancy restaurants on the strip with tasty food and superb service!!!!! Don't waste your money and time on this steakhouse. Not worth it.... 
We are locals and definitely will not come back to this restaurant...."}
{"text":"I love steaks. I love Ruth's Chris. I took my entire team here for a dinner and they were incredibly flexible with me when it came to my reservation. I forgot to call ahead and they managed to squeeze me in within 2 hours of me calling for a group of 7.

What I did like was the level of service that we got, that you normally expect from a Ruth's Chris steakhouse and the overall quality of the steaks and sides. We got plenty of appetizers, including the calamari and seared ahi tuna which were both delicious and then all of us ended up ordering different steaks and I got myself a Filet Mignon. It came out a bit too burnt on the outside and arguably medium-well rather than the medium I had ordered. My normal experience at steakhouses is that they usually undercook from what you order so if you order a steak medium rare it comes out almsot rare and when you order a steak well, it comes out medium well. This way, they never overcook the meat or have to give you a new steak if you're unhappy with the grill. Normally, I would say that I was just being picky, but one of my colleagues ended up actually sending his steak back because he too ordered a medium steak and it ended up coming out medium-well.

The desserts were fantastic and delicious and overall, the meal was very filling and satisfying. No matter that it cost me about $100 a head, we enjoyed ourselves. However, I would like to point out to the restaurant's management that they should consider slightly undercooking, not overcooking their steaks. And that they should re-train some of their waitstaff as our waiter constantly tried upselling us on sparking mineral water throughout the meal. Keep in mind that we had already ordered two bottles and some cocktails.

Also, one of the waitresses that came by ended up pouring a half glass of still water into a glass of sparkling water without asking before pouring. This also may require some retraining of the staff as it wouldn't be a problem if they didn't charge extra for sparking mineral water. Overall, my experience was okay but this location definitely needs work when compared to the Ruth's Chris of San Diego and Del Mar."}
{"text":"Ever been disappointed by Ruth Chris? No?  Of course not.  Worried about cost?  Stick to the filet and forego the sides or try the prix fixe menu.  Just remember:  You don't go every day, it is worth splurging for an exceptional meal on occassion, and you certainly are getting what you are paying for."}
{"text":"Dine here 11/27/2016... 1st time @ this location. Been to the Beverly Hills one and San Francisco one. Both 5 stars. This one however, sad to say is a 1star. 

Maybe 1.5 stars bc the steak was seasoned well. But overcooked. Asked for medium. Came out medium well.

Baked potato had everything on it even though I asked to have everything on the SIDE. And was over done.

Mashed Potatoes were super late. We were more than half way through our meal and asked for it twice b4 receiving it. 

Dessert never came. Mind you we ordered the 3 course meal. Extra bread never came despite asking politely for some. Drinks were not refilled to save her life. 

Asked for check twice and was never brought. She entertained her other guests and made us wait for eternity. Another waitress brought our mashed potatoes. And to top it off we never got an apology. 

I'm not one to complain but this was too much. I hope it was isolated, but don't expect me to dine there ever again even if my diamond member friends invite me. Sorry, but worst service ever. Total rewards? I think not. More like no rewards. MLife for life. 

Sad Jessica ruined what was to be a nice relaxing anniversary dinner. 

To all Californians just go to Beverly Hills or San Francisco for your Ruth's Chris experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I had date night here and loved the service and food.  The chilled seafood tower was amazing as was our fillet entrees and the apple tart dessert. The only complaint we had was the couple sitting next to us.  Lots of negativity coming from the lady...99% of it was not about the the restaurant. .  We thought about asking to move tables but the food was coming and we found used on that!  Great service from Trisha... we will be back."}
{"text":"They're back bay-beee to quote George Costanza. Holly/Heather - sorry I forgot her name. At any rate, she redeemed the whole experience. Can't wait to go back and let the X treat us to a real deal meal. We visited 2x in November due to this redemption and nothing has failed the service and great expectation test. =)"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I have not taken time to write a review - sooner!

Let me tell all y'all.... 
Maybe it was because we haven't been since July 2014 in Wisconsin. 
Maybe because I later saw they were full price and I'm used to paying half off for happy hour. BUT CHILLLLLLEEEEEEEEE~~~~~~~~~~ Those stuffed mushrooms lit up every taste bud. 

The December special will remain a steadfast family staple. 2 lobster tails and a filet or Ribeye. Muah :* 

Ashlynn was our server and we sat in the bar (expecting Happy Hour) but watched the tv. The kid was provided the remote for viewing pleasure. Asst. Server was top notch. Timing had to be explained to our slow diner and AShlynn happily chimed in to explain pacing and time. 

Wish I could get back sooner but we're limited to 1x a month."}
{"text":"I frequented this place in 2011. 

I love coming here or any RCSH for that matter but this location has 
1) Valet
2) Deals 
3) Happy Hour 
4) Nice decor and appropriately appointed as all other locations (Midwest to the East Coast). 

I came because they offer lunch and I never got to have a burger in all the times that I've been but today - help me (insert hand waving) 

The Prime Burger was ordered Medium Well - I got something pretty dry. 
With cheddar - It was melted down 
Pickles - Relish was offered. This was a cute gesture 
Onions and Lettuce as requested

No lemons for my water ever arrived


The service wasn't Ruth Chris ready but oh well. 
The patty was salty to me. 
The bun was hard enough that it cut the roof of my mouth like chips would do. And I appreciate a toasted bun. 
The bun seems freshly made and baked nearby, if not on site. 


The fries were overcooked as in they were pretty substance free. This made not taking them out pretty easy. 

Lawd knows I love some Ruth Chris. The +1 was most upset they didn't have Gumbo on the menu. I'm like just wait for NOLA RCSH for such. I'd try the salmon or stuffed chicken breast for lunch next time. 

The bacon on the +1 burger wasn't served as long strips but dices instead. 

Le Sigh."}
{"text":"Don't worry about money. The food is to die for. Their new lobster Mac n cheese is the best side I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I would always tell people that the best steak I have ever had was at Harrah's in Las Vegas.  This was in the early 2000s, and I had not eaten there since.  I had been wanting to go back and revisit that same steakhouse to see if it was as good as I remember.  During my most recent visit to Vegas I got to do so, but the steakhouse is now a Ruth's Chris.  I was not too disappointed by the change, as I really liked Ruth's Chris when I dined at the Beverly Hills location.  I looked forward to dining here even more knowing that it was now a Ruth's Chris, and I had only been to one once before.

I tend to keep my orders basic when I go to a higher end steakhouse, and this visit was no exception.  My meal consisted of the filet and sides of the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.  It was all superbly flavorful with great presentation.  The steak was exactly how I wanted it prepared, and the potatoes and spinach were great complements.  The experience was highlighted even further by the attentive service of the excellent staff.

My visit to Ruth's Chris was the most memorable dining experience on my recent trip to Vegas.  It was outstanding from beginning to end with great service, atmosphere, and food.  It may not have been the best steak I have ever had, but it was most definitely in the top 10.  I won't wait over 10 years this time to dine here again!"}
{"text":"After 5 days in LV I decided to take my wife out to one of my faves  (she's never been here so another star for me) we had each had a steak (hers topped with a peppercorn sauce) shared the au grauten a bottle of smash berry and a banana dessert. Only one mark down is her steak was a little more on the well side then she liked but service excellent,  food  great but just the one fumble was not enough for me to take off a star. Been to RC in Walnut Creek ,SF and SD  so I know the service here is on or above where it is any other ones I've  been to. Glad this was our choice as an ending to our trip. Thanks Ruth Chris"}
{"text":"Judging from all the good reviews of this place we most of come in the wrong night. I came to Las Vegas from Miami on a Bdayyy getaway. Came into this location on Dec 12 Saturday night at 10:02 pm. We were told by the hostess we couldn't sit on the main dining room. To seat our selves in the lounge. After sitting for about 7 minutes without anyone acknowledging us a server came by and told us that section was closed. Went to the lounge tables  next to the bar where we waited another 7 minutes or so to be given menus. Finally ordered. We got our first course a soup with still no water, no bread and no utensils (no wine either ) on the table. At that point called the manager over and asked if this was a Ruth Chris. The manager ended up waiting on us for the rest of the evening. The food was lame at best. Service non existant  (never saw the waitress again until the check ) Also the table next to us was in the same predicament they ended up wrapping most of their meals and leaving after asking for service several times. I felt I was at Dennys with a different name! !! PS.. I go to RC Coral Gables,  Miami ALL the time at lunch, Happy Hour, dinner, weekdays, weekends no matter how busy they are 20 people would acknowledge you and ask how can they assist you! !!! Never will go to this location again! !!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! We came here the week they opened for Super Bowl weekend and returned a year later for another great meal.  My sea bass with lobster and crab, hubby's steak melted in your mouth, great broccoli and potatoes. So full we couldn't enjoy a dessert! I do wish they had more selections of Chardonnay by the glass. It's good for those of us that have spouses that don't drink much. I can't drink a whole bottle by myself. The glass of wine I drank was very good. The service, as usual, was awesome. See you again!"}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because of the restaurant manager. Otherwise I would have given 5. My 3rd time at a Ruth's Chris and my BF's first time.  We had reservations and all was going well, we were the only hispanics there which to me was a bit odd but ok... until the restaurant manager came out of the kitchen and headed straight for us and asked us if everything was good. I smiled and said yes it is thank you. And she walked away. Which is when I realized we were the ONLY table she approached the entire time we were there. She passed by a couple more times but in the time that we were there I never saw her ask anyone else how everything was.  I don't want to think it was racial profiling but after that I felt uncomfortable. (Maybe next time she should try to be a little less conspicuous).
The food was good except the lobster bisque was just ok (I've had better) and our waiter Jesse was great, knowledgeable and gave us great service!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite place for a steak or a treat.  We had a shrimp, scallops, chicken, brussels sprouts and it was all delicious. Make sure you ask for Adam, we've eaten there a number of times and he is definitely the best server there."}
{"text":"I ordered room service and I was not impressed... Ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was not good. The fries I got were good but the dessert was the bread pudding which tasted old... Over all disappointed"}
{"text":"We came in here for dinner for my husband's birthday and it was wonderful!  We both had Caesar salads petite filets and two sides.  We ordered the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach!  We both love creamed spinach and this was the best we've ever had!  Our steaks were done perfectly done.  The service was excellent!  We also had a table by a window!  Very nice atmosphere!  Good wine selection too!  Will be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night to spend our anniversary with my hubby and our server name is Randy. He doing very good job.. love the food. We order ribeye for two peoples, mac and cheese lobster, creamy spinach (hhmmm soso) and mushroom crab cake (the best so far) . But the only issue we order steak 40onz for 2 peoples, probably steak only 30onz and the bone 10onz.. the bone is way to big."}
{"text":"The sizzle and the smell of heavenly butter awaits you at Ruth Chris' steakhouse.  Went with a friend for Winterlicious and I am really picky about my steaks but this one has been one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Ever.  It was that \"melt in your mouth\" texture and it was absolutely scrumptious.  

We ordered mash potatoes & creamed spinach as sides.  They were OK.  Not the best sides I've ever had but then the Keg has that twice baked potato and really, who can beat that?  

Both of us had the chocolate sin cake for dessert.  It was really delicious but way too rich for one person.  The portion of that cake was huge and probably, if I came here for a non-winterlicious event again, I'd share that slice of cake.  It's got a rich ganache filling with a hint of espresso.  Delicious! 

Would I come again?  Most definitely!!! I'm going to come on a non-winterlicious day to give their side dishes another chance and also to experience another variety of desserts...and of course, eat their wonderful steak again."}
{"text":"The service was terrible! The asparagus was gross and soggy, almost like out of a can! The holandase (sp) sauce was gross as well. My baked potatoe was cold which was very disappointing! My steak was over cooked, which I was hoping would save the evening. We complained to our server, but she didn't seem interested. She was more interested in flirting with the table behind us with which she constantly checked up on, but totally ignored us! The manager was just as unhelpful. Save your time and your money...go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"4 Words: Lobster Macaroni and Cheese. 

I just recently visited Ruth's Chris for the first time and I was very impressed. Although it was never on my \"radar\" of places to go, but the Cleveland location is inside my work building in Public Square downtown so I thought I would celebrate Admin Pro Day here with my fellow employees.

I ordered the spicy shrimp, which was so flavorful. The cucumber salad as garnish was the perfect blend of flavors and paired perfectly with the shrimp. 

But you all know where this review is going...

The lobster macaroni and cheese was the best I've ever tasted. Hands down. The cheese blend was super smoky and flavorful, gooey and warm. The macaroni was cooked to perfection. The lobster was a perfect mix to the dish.

If you go to Ruth's Chris, get the mac and cheese. No regrets will happen. Promise."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh-mazing.  Took my wife here for her first time ever at a Ruths...she said it was the best steak she ever had in her life!  As always mine was so good words can't describe.  They even hooked us up with Free banana pie for our anniversary .... they had anniversary confetti and everything.  We felt like a king and queen ... Cant wait to go back!

I had the filet and my wife had the bone in rib eye .... and WOW I think I have a new favorite over there!  If you have never been to a Ruth Chris ... go ... it will be the ONLY time in your life you spend so much on a steak, but don't even care!!  I promise!!"}
{"text":"We came here on Valentines Day 2015. We made reservations well in advance for 7:30 pm and were seated fairly quickly. That's about the only thing that happened as it should have. 

We waited for probably 8 minutes for someone to come by with water. Our server came by to introduce himself and almost as an after thought took our drink order. It only went downhill from there.

In short, our drinks sat empty for far too long, our waiter was missing for large chunks of time, he kept forgetting to take our orders, and got one of our orders wrong. The food was just average. We got the stuffed mushrooms, surf and turf, salmon, lobster Mac and cheese, and broccoli au gratin (which we never tried because the order was put through as plain broccoli and we were finished eating by the time it came out). The steak was weird tasting. It didn't cook evenly throughout and was almost chalky in texture. To top all of this off, the bathrooms were dirty (bordering gross) and had no paper towels. What the heck!?

When you come to a restaurant and spend $100 a person you expect great food and exceptional service. Instead, we got average food and pretty bad service. We were there for 2 hours, most of which was spent wondering where the waiter was. Look at my other reviews...we are not super picky and ridiculous people. We were hugely disappointed and will definitely never come here again."}
{"text":"By far the best happy hour deals of any of the upscale steakhouses in the valley. Nice bar, impeccable service and great food."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Ruth's Chris Steak House in Middleton last night and we both absolutely loved it! They put rose petals at our table, which, apparently \"marked us\" as an anniversary couple. Several of the staff stopped at our table briefly to wish us a happy anniversary - what a nice touch!

We ordered from the Ruth's Classic Dinner menu. Your meal comes with a soup or salad, an entrée, a side, and dessert. The portion sizes were just right.  I ordered a 12 oz ribeye for my entrée, cooked medium. It came to our table sizzling hot (love it) tender and delicious! It was seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper.

My wife likes her steak well done and she said \"they nailed it!\" Some other places really knock the crap our of your steak if you order it well done and you end up with a hockey puck. But tonight her 6oz steak filet was juicy, hot, and tender with a nice crust on the edge. She could tell that someone in the kitchen really took some care when making her steak.

We finished the evening with a turtle cheesecake that was delightful. This was our first time at Ruth's Chris and we will definitely be coming back. What a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and seeing as I've been to the one in Mississauga several times, I gotta say the calgary one sucks!!! I will say that the front staff is awesome and friendly. I love that they pay for parking too!! 

The real deal breaker is once you get to the table. Talk about idiotic service staff. For the price you pay here you expect 5 star service which is far from what you get here!!! You're a hassle to them it seems. I don't know if it's because were a group of Asians that bothers them. But why should that even matter?? 

The food is very mediocre. They don't have the same menu as their other locations which is fine because restaurants should serve local produce anyway. The second time we ate there our Caesar salads looked like they were from Wendy's!!! WTH??? I get a better salad at Denny's!!!  

I think I did like my dessert. But I only gave Ruth's in Calgary 2 stars for their service based on price. I get better service at McDonalds. Calgary's location is nothing compared to Mississauga."}
{"text":"I have to say. Service is impeccable here!! The service staff is knowledgeable and so friendly. It costs an arm and a leg to eat here but it's worth it for a perfectly done meal. This is one of the few places that serve escargot and i love escargot!!! They do not disappoint. The escargot with artichokes is really good!!! I could eat a whole dish to myself!!!  Lamb chops are of the highest quality. I had sea bass the last time and it was soooooo good!!! Their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Great wine selection. I ordered creme brûlée last time and it was okay. The berries were very fresh. The whipped butter that comes with the bread is addicting. Lol!!! I was full but wanted bread just to have the butter. I don't know why we don't just indulge more often. Hubby loves the lamb chops here because they're always done perfect and so moist and sweet. Worth the $215 bill each time!!!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"First impressions really get me. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a warm friendly face. They do coat check as well.  Skip to the meal...we ordered the escargot & carpaccio and they were both excellent!! (My cousin wasn't a fan of the carpaccio, but not everyone really likes raw meat sliced thinly on a plate...lol.)

I never normally like lamb because i can't stand the gamey taste of it, but Ruth's (this location & the Mississauga one) does it soooo good that there is zero gamey taste in it.  Hands down the best lamb ever!!  I finished my plate and the special butternut squash side.  The fries are a bit of a disappointment but those were for my toddler anyway. The mushrooms were very tasty.

My only complaint was that the waiter forgot my drink order, and at the end I ordered a cheesecake with a latte.  The cheesecake was excellent but my latte came out lukewarm! Ugh!!  It must've been sitting there a while before the server served it to me...ah well.  I could've asked for a new one but seeing as my cousin returned her lobster bisque earlier I didn't wanna bother.  (Ya her lobster bisque was a bit bitter because they made it with cognac...ummm...okay. I tried a bit and it was quite bitter.)

Our overall experience was excellent.  As long as the service is good and the food is excellent I'm usually a happy camper. It's something that's expected when you're paying over $400.00 for 3 people for dinner. (My hubby ordered a bottle of wine.)

Parking is a bit crappy tho. You park underground at the Hilton at $6 for the weekend. It's very confusing as to how to get there.  I'd be okay with just eating at the Mississauga location next time tho. We only went to the downtown Toronto location because it was close to where my cousin lives."}
{"text":"The food is good. Perhaps my expectations where too high but I didn't find it exceptional or special. I would go back but with other good steakhouses at this price point, I would choose another."}
{"text":"We booked our dinner reservations on Open Table. When we got there, the staff was friendly, inviting and offered us a seat in the patio while our table was prepared. We celebrated my girlfriends birthday with our kids. The food was excellent. While waiting for the food, we noticed we forgot to order salads for whatever reason. Anyway's, the excitement of eating there overlapped the waiter not asking us about the salads. Great time, we'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary here and it was well worth it. Our server Todd was always making sure we were very satisfied with our meal and service. He was very knowledgeable and social.
When we ordered our meal he mentioned that the kitchen was a little behind.
We started with the Crab Stack which had lumps of blue crab atop avocado and mango, which was a substitute for our salad.
I ordered the petite rib eye, 12 oz and my wife had the petite filet, 6 oz, and lobster. I decided to add 6 shrimp to my steak. On the side, we added mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My steak was seasoned well, but just a bit salty.
As a dessert, they brought out marvelous and tasty treat."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal as was the service! My petite filet steak was perfect! I am still dreaming about the sweet potato casserole-it was amazing! Great experience in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The staff at the restaurant were outstanding.  Very personable and thoughtful. I ordered the filet with shrimp and mistakenly asked for medium well because I can't eat meat that is too raw.  The meat was very charred, tough and dry. Too bad to see it that way. The shrimp was flavorful and delicious. I had a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. Luckily the hollandaise sauce helped to moisten and add flavor to the meat as well. I had the apple tart for dessert because it was described as having a flaky crust. Turns out the crust was tuff and soggy. Clearing it had died a quick death in the microwave. Fortunately the apple filling was juicy and flavorful. For the money, I definitely would have expected more. I've often wondered what the chain was like and now I know that I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yes, tonight was a special occasion, and what a special night it was.

This is our first visit to this location, and after reading the reviews on Yelp, we had to give it a try.  To top it off, we were confident that this would be the right place to spend this occasion, and let me tell you we were not disappointed.

For starters, I used Yelp, to place the reservations online via the open table reservations.  It was simple and since I prepared two weeks in advance the time slot was readily available.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, they offer courtesy valet parking, a private parking lot, and a parking garage for your convenience. The hostess met us at the door, she was very friendly, and took our names for the reservation.  We were very promptly seated, our drinks were promptly filled with water, and bread and butter was provided at that time. Our server was at our table just after the water finished flowing and was very informative regarding the menu.

I would have provided pictures as I normally do, however, I did feel somewhat uncomfortable trying to take photos during this special night, and opted to just write a review instead.

My wife's meal consisted of the Petite Filet, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  I had the Ribeye with the BBQ Crab Steak Topping which had a very buttery yet skampi-ish type flavor. It had a very nice flavor and the crab was awesome.  

We skipped the desert , and headed to the Cheesecake Factory across the street, but let me tell you that the deserts that passed by our table looked very good.

This meal had all of the essentials of an great meal. Great service, great food, and while I may have splurged tonight, it was definitely placed on our to be back lists, regardless of the occasion.

I am stingy with my stars, but this was a solid 5 star experience.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for our anniversary and we weren't really sure what to expect since we kind of just picked a place that sounded fancy and expensive. 
And indeed, expensive it was...but the food and atmosphere of the place really exceeded our expectations.

Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, having previously made a reservation online.

The atmosphere of the entire building is very intimate, romantic and classy. Dim-lighting, \"the works\". We were seated in a back, private area which was nice given our special occasion. 

My boyfriend and I are both meat lovers, so he ordered the Ribeye and I, the New York Strip. 

I must admit, this was one of the BEST steaks I have ever had. My steak was rich, succulent, and had JUST the right amount of juice spilling out. My boyfriend was also ecstatic about how great his Ribeye tasted. 
We, in addition to our entrees, ordered 4 sides 'a la carte' since the menu was explained somewhat confusingly to us, so we just ordered what sounded good (asparagus, mashed potatoes, french fries and stuffed mushrooms). They were all wonderfully prepared and extremely delicious.

We were both pleasantly surprised by how many leftovers we had and how full we both were, and we hadn't even eaten all of our entrees and sides. So needless to say, we did not order dessert. (However it was extremely tempting.) 

Another small, but contributing factor to our experience was unfortunately our noisy neighbors, sitting at the table behind us. There was a group of middle aged couples being extremely noisy, which was completely inappropriate and annoying to everyone else sitting around them, since the ambience was clearly meant to be more hushed and intimate. They would burst out laughing obnoxiously, every 10 minutes and seemed more interested in their wine than their politeness to everyone else around them, trying to enjoy their quiet meals. This ruined the experience somewhat for us, but completely wasn't a deal breaker.

Our waiter was very friendly, made us laugh, speedy and polite. What more could you ask for?

We weren't surprised by the bill, just because it was a special occasion and we had planned on spending a bit of money, but it was still more than $100 for the two of us, without salads, dessert, wine and tip. But we didn't mind since we thoroughly enjoyed our experience, and we even got to take quite a bit of it back home with us. 

The only negative I have for this experience was the noisy neighbors, who obviously didn't have any regard for the surrounding tables. 

Overall a great experience, and I would definitely come back here for a special occasion given the delicious food and great service. Not crazy about the prices, but I can deal."}
{"text":"It's all about happy hour! I could drink their Raspberry Rosemary Cosmo everyday and not tire of it.. the Blueberry mojito was also good, less sweet, lighter and a pretty presentation. 

Best hh eats were the tuna and the burger and fries - delicious and generous, full-sized helpings (enough to share, no doubt)."}
{"text":"For my birthday this year my wonderful husband took me to Ruth's Chris for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 7pm for our reservation. But soon started filling up with a few couples and several tables of business men. it went from fairly quiet to noisey just as quickly. 
I would've taken pictures inside but the lighting was so dim, although perfect for a nice romantic dinner setting, was less than ideal for my Iphone camera.
We started off with a couple cocktails awaited our stuffed mushroom appetizer and enjoyed conversation.
Our waiter was informative and very pleasant. (M Miles?)
Our stuffed mushrooms arrive and it is 4 fairly good sized mushrooms over stuffed with a very nice crab stuffing, topped with butter melting in the dish. Wonderful flavors blended in not over seasoned and could have used a little more cheese on top and maybe its just me but I thought a squeeze of lemon would have set it over the top! Yum

next we had our dinner, my husband had the ribeye and I choose the petite filet with shrimp. sides we choose were the asparagus with hollandaise and potatoes au gratin which is enough for 2 people to share so becareful on ordering sides plenty of sharing family style opportunites. The asparagus were perfectly aldente and the hollandaise is none like I have ever had it was the consistency of a mayonnaise with a pleasant flavor. and it complimented the asparagus well. 
my 2 small filets melted in my mouth and each was topped with 3 nice sized shrimp each. this is a great alternative and less expensive than buying the filet and adding $12 for the 6 shrimp! 
i tasted my husbands ribeye and it was very tasty but in my opinion could've been more tender. 
now the au gratin potatoes we did not care for. there was a strange taste of cheese we could not put our finger on. very strong pungent cheese that left an after taste in our mouths. upon asking the waiter what was in it he returned to say the odd cheese was some kind of italian cheese (dont remeber the name) and he and the manager Kevin said they would take it off our bill, but hence it did not disappear so that was $8 thrown in the trash!
we ordered the creme brulee which is out of this world! I personally dont like custard like desserts but I will eat this any time!
our waiter also brought us on the house a trio of desserts, it was the chocolate sin cake, rasberry sorbet and a mini cheesecake. my husband melted into the cheesecake savoring every bite. the sorbet was glorious and the chocolate sin cake, well my first bit all I could say is WOW. that is pure chocolate, eating more than a couple bites will send you into a sugar shock! if you love dark chocolate this is the dish for you! I highly recommend sharing that sin! I did love combining a small bite of the cake along with the sorbet, it balanced out the strong cake very well. 

I would love to eat here often but the cost is the downfall for that. 2 of us spent $155 without tip.
2 jack and coke $18.50
2 crown and coke $20.50
mushrooms $12
petite filet and shrimp $39.00
ribeye $40
asparagus $9
potatoes $8
creme brulee $8

a wonderful meal for a wonderful end to my day!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We came for our anniversary and they asked me when I called to make the reservation if we were celebrating anything, so I told them we were celebrating our anniversary. They made the evening very special for our dinner. There were rose petals spread over our table and gave us a complementary dessert. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was not so good this time. Steak usually moist and on a hot plate of butter. This time, a little dry. Waiter was good but general manager was rude and unaccommodating. Won't be going back ever. Plenty of other good steak houses in the area. Go to Donovan's instead."}
{"text":"Dined at the Toronto Ruth's Chris after scooping up the promotion of loyalty points for gift card purchase with bonus loyalty points.

Loyalty Card: free to sign up, collect a point for each $10 spent, each point can be redeemed for $1 on the pre tax bill. I bought the gift card which had a promo for points so I paid $50 for gift card and 100 points!

Food: very good steak! The plates were sizzling and the flavour was delicious! They garnish and plate the steak with flavouring which brought out the amazing taste in the meat! 

The sides were huge and well cooked, I got the asparagus and the fries with hollandaise on the side :) I also tried the bernaise sauce but was not too  impressed with the flavour. 

Drinks: these drinks were expensive but very well made! I had two of the mojitos myself because they were deliciousness! However, the drinks aren't very strong so I could've used two more :(

The environment was nice and the server was clearly very well trained! 

Definitely worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Took the family of 5 and we had a very good experience. Waitress (Samantha) was attentive and provided feedback on appetizer selections. Everyone went with beef, mostly filets and we were all pleased with our orders. There was a slight mixup on the NY strip we ordered. Not sure what the mixup was but it wasn't available with the rest of the food. They cooked a ribeye as quickly as possible and brought it out for my son to have something to eat while the strip was cooked. Not ideal as he didn't order a ribeye but was full by the time the strip arrived. So not ideal for a family dinner but as a dad I was excited to have an extra steak to take home and eat the next day so the value of the meal increased in my eyes. The sides were very good. Sweet potato casserole was the favorite. Mashed potatoes and lobster Mac and cheese were also very good."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is the same anywhere I go.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"THIS Should have been posted for the uptown location on south tryon street..my apologys..
This place most def deserves five stars..even tho there is one closer to me on Greenville..I wanted to surprise the lady for once..so I made a reservation for their private wine cellar for two..all I can say is it was stunning..all the way to the cellar she kept asking where we were going? Why did we past the kitchen? But once we reached the door she was in tears..speechless..if you ever want to impress your female fellas..I suggest the private cellar..you are far enough not to hear anything and you can even close the door if you like..
Now for the service and food..the server should be commended..same with the maitre d/ sommelier.. I told these guys this date had to be special..and they went above and beyond..far from being overbearing..they kept a wonderful pace throughout the meal..to make us feel as if we were in control..I ordered the Moët Chandon bottle..will opt for the Moët Rose next time..we had the porterhouse for two..and I asked the waiter if I could request to the chef if he could sear the steak in the broiler and cook it the rest of the way in the oven..request granted..it came out sizzling on a hot plate..tasted more like butter than the butter melted on the top..I also ordered the lobster tail..was good..just a little too spicy with the Cajun seasoning they put on top..almost gave it a salty spicy taste..but it was cooked perfectly..the waiter suggested the lobster Mac and cheese..but baby doll isn't big on seafood so we opted for the mashed potatoes..broccoli and sweet potatoes..all the sides were excellent too..
I begin to have cramps in my hands in the middle of our meal ( always something to try to mess up a great thing) but our server was very accomadating with that too..when we asked if we could box the rest of our stuff up to go..within a minute  someone was putting it in boxes for us..i think he felt so bad for me because she basically had to feed me..he gave us a dessert to go..just wanted to say thank you to the waiter, maitre d and chef for providing a experience that will long be remembered..made regulars outta us..she asked me five times on the way home..how you ever gonna beat that? Posted pics of the wine cellar and the food so you can check it out for yourself.. With food comparable to the Capitol grille and Flemings and mortons..the cellar is that special touch that puts them two steps ahead of the competitors..keep it up ..and thank you for a wonderful experience again..
Sorry for the mishap!!"}
{"text":"My mother handed my cousins and I her credit card and said go enjoy your cousin's birthday.  What she did was the worst mistake a mother can do, offer the open option agreement.  I believe in her head she thought we would modestly go for pizza or perhaps if a little daring Chinese.  Oh no of course not, we headed directly to Ruth's Chris.  

Ruth's Chris Steak House sits directly at the base of the Calgary Tower; I don't need a view to enjoy what I know to be a very expensive meal.  Entering the restaurant, we were literally giggling, I mean my cousins and I are well beyond our late twenties.  But giggling?  

Of course we started our first course with martinis, whisky and white wine.   Appetizers of shrimp, and salads were soon ordered.  What another round of drinks? Sure! And of course what RC's is known for, top of the line Alberta Grade A beef, I mean this is a steak house.  Be careful though, if you do order one of the many sides, (baked potato, mashed potato etc) just get one because these are big portions and can be an even bigger dent to the pocket book if ordered per person.

The ambience in this place is dressed for Calgary's elite; a very classy deco interior, with brass and dark wood detailing, staff is formal, friendly and pristine.  Dressed to the tens with the best service this city should offer, we were absolutely delighted.  

So the ticket price of 3, enjoying drinks, appys and a steak meal at RC's?  Well it's 40 for 50 dollars a steak, so round it off $300 and don't forget the 20% gratuity.  

In this yelpers opinion, is it worth the hype? If you want to impress a very important business associate perhaps,   but for you're out of town guests or that special steak meal, R.C's is not my personal first choice, I can enjoy a nice meal at the Keg or Cattle Baron for half the price.

Needless to say my mother never offered her credit card again."}
{"text":"If you are not getting comped or expensing dinner, definitely don't go to this Ruth's.  The place is in the pennysaver Harrah's resort.  It's depressing inside the casino, this environment should have been updated 20 years ago.  

I loved Ruth's in Pittsburgh, Louisville, and several other locations, but this one is just not up to the expectations Ruth's advertises.

If you are looking for an elegant dinner experience there are 100's in Vegas, this is not one.  

The first indication of an upcoming bad experience, well after entering Harrah's, is there is no enforcement of a dress code.  People had cut off jeans, crop top shirts and flip flops (without the bodies that should be wearing such revealing clothes, I'm talking 200 pound women where the shorts are vacuumed up locations best undescribed).  This wasn't unusual, it was the predominate outfit.  This isn't the pool, but it was the norm when we were there, Monday May 2, 2016.

Pretty good cocktail prices, around $15 for specialty drinks.  4 shrimp (1 order) cocktail, the best part of the meal $22, 11 oz (although it looked larger, more like 14 oz) filet for around $60. Sides were priced at market rate.  The Oscar topping was horrible, canned or old crab meat definitely ruined anything it was served on.   It reminded me of the \"cheese\" sauce you buy in 64 oz cans at Sams. It also, seemed like it accompanied almost everything.  The steaks were cooked to order, good but not spectacular.  I'd rate the experience and food quality as that you'd see in a chain, such as Texas Roadhouse, etc.  Not what you'd expect from \"fine\" dining, or prices in this category.

Server John was very attentive, helpful, and was busy but efficient.

Expect to pay around $100 each for a truly uninspiring dinner.  Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were seated at 8 for a party of 7 on Saturday night. After several minutes of sitting, our waiter came over to the table. Uninspiring, we had to pull the words from his mouth. There was no welcome, no hello, no explanation of the menu. We ordered drinks, which arrived 30 minutes later. The restaurant was maybe half full. The drinks finally arrived. Again, no mention or description of the menu. We dine out often, and when we go to Any restaurant, let alone a white table cloth place, the service needs to match the level of the food. The waiter, and manager for that point, appeared to come from Applebee's. once the food arrived, we were less disappointed while we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a fairly expensive bottle of wine, which we were told they were out of. We wound up ordering two other bottles, over $300 in total. Another pet peeve of mine is adding 15% gratuity. Know your customer. Our bill was over $1,000 including the tip. I can't remember the last time I only tipped 15%, but once they added it in, that's all they got. Paying $8 for parking was icing on the cake. They need to take a lesson from Red, Hyde Park, or Mortons to understand what service is."}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris, but this one in Vegas was a little lacking. The lobster bisque and onion soups were VERY salty. The steaks were a little bland. And the creme brulee was too heavy. It was such a disappointment, but the service was good and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've dined with Ruth's Chris before, South Park and Uptown. Uptown is my all around favorite. Their customer service is phenomenal. They made my dining experience last night 1/25/17 one of the best I've had.... Anywhere!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a good plate of steak and potatoes and this place has it! The filet was very tender and seasoned perfectly. Mash potatoes had a hint of garlic. Asparagus with hollandaise was cooked impeccably. My only complain was the lobster tail that came with my surf and turf. For $67 I was given what couldn't have been anymore bigger than 3 of my fingers put together. 
Normally steakhouses you pay a ton but get a ton of food. Enough for a doggy bag at least. This place gave just the right amount of food for 1 sitting. I guess that's great but if that's the case don't charge $67! Total bill for 2 people (2 entrees and 2 sides, no wine or soda $170 with tip) 

I definitely wouldn't return. For that much money you have to blow me away. They were doing great until I saw that lobster tail however."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Ruth's Chris Steak houses in Boston, LA, and now this Hilton Toronto location. I feel that my experience at every place was very similar - the steaks are pretty good, but I always feel like what I'm getting doesn't quite meet with the price I'm paying. 

The atmosphere is very nice - it was a bit disconcerting at first to realize that it was in the basement of the Hilton, but it has a very dark atmosphere so you don't really notice. 

Ordered the New York strip - our party also ordered a burger off the kids menu, a ribeye, and the 'signature' chop salad recommended by the waiter. I think I was a little annoyed to notice that the steaks do not come with sides - those need to be ordered separately to be shared. At 60 dollars for the steak, I would have appreciated a bit of veggies or something on the side. 

The meat itself was massive and came on a hot plate with what must have been a entire stick of sizzling, melted butter. Visually it was very impressive, and had a delicious, meaty smell to it. It had formed a nice crust, and had the medium rare pink hue that I like when I cut into it. However, all of the flavor was coming directly from the butter. This might sound strange, but I would have definitely liked the steak more if there was less of it; by the time I was halfway through, I had pretty much hit meat saturation and was pretty sick of it- I think the other people at my table were at a similar place as well.

The salad was pretty good, and came in a cool cylindrical formation. The burger from the kids menu was extremely uninspiring, especially for the price, but I guess that's what happens when you try to take kids to a steakhouse.

Consistently, I can say that every experience can be summed up by saying that at Ruth's Chris, you pay a lot for way too much food."}
{"text":"This was one of my best dining experiences in Madison. A friend and I went as part of restaurant week, and had an amazing time. We had a reservation, but they were a bit behind, so we went to the lounge area while we waited. I had the pomegranate martini, which was quite tasty. 

We were seated fairly quickly, and our server Jen was awesome! She was very energetic, funny, and kind, and her recommendations were spot on.  Jen really made the whole experience way better. The atmosphere was very nice and the decor was gorgeous. Also, although we were eating slowly, everything was brought out after we had finished the previous dish completely and clearly freshly made.

We started with the fried calamari, which may have been one of the best dishes I have ever had! It was sweet and a little tangy, and cooked perfectly! 10 stars!  The lobster bisque was also good, though everything paled a bit after that calamari. 

For the main course, we each had the petite filet, which was sizzling hot and perfectly cooked medium rare. The mashed potatoes were delicious, though the sautéed mushrooms weren't quite up to par. Finally, we finished with chocolate mousse, which was creamy and light and topped with the most delicious whipped cream - I could have eaten several cups of it, even though I was so stuffed!"}
{"text":"Had a 6:30pm Monday night reservation for Restaurant Week.
By 7pm the restaurant was full. Our waiter, Russ, was great along with Matt, both very attentive. There was staff everywhere, they were hopping. Great service, exquisite food. We had the stuffed chicken & salmon. I know, I know, we didn't order steak. It was still fabulous. And the mini dessert cheescake was just the right size. I can see why this is a top notch restaurant!!!"}

Service is excellent

We got 16oz rib eye, filet mignon, sea bass, side of mash and salad. That was plenty of food for 4, few drinks. Ask for bread-they won't bring it unless you request
Split T-bone or rib eye, 16 oz is huge!
Don't order salad-it's mediocre 
$240check+$50tips and we got best steak experience with my family"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but never written a review, so here it goes: Over the years this place keeps it consistent. It's nice, the service is good, the food is alright, but a little pricy for what you get. There are better steaks out there for the same money. Things that I really enjoy here: shoestring fries and their chocolate sin cake.

A few tips: They participate in Summerlicious and Winterlicious - $45 for a 3-course dinner. However, they will not put that menu out unless you ask for it. Also, Costco sells their gift cards at $80 for $100. And, on Sundays they have a deal for $39 for a 6oz filet and shoestring fries."}
{"text":"I'm very good customer come almost every week I can say the steak hasn't been as good recently with poor service in lounge area"}
{"text":"There are not enough great things to say about this place. Came here to
celebrate an anniversary and it was amazing. From the atmosphere, to the service to the food. Amazing from start to finish. This was my first time here, will not be my last, and has easily won my vote for favorite steakhouse, if not restaurant. Can't wait to go again!! Thank you for making our anniversary a memorable one and we will be customers for life!"}
{"text":"I have been 4 times, and will always go back. The food, expensive, is worth it. A great place to celebrate an occasion, or bring a date. The steaks are cooked perfectly and taste like heaven. The sides are melt in your mouth bursting with flavour. The downfall is that for the prices, the entrees should come with sides as other restaurants provide. This will not stop me from going back."}
{"text":"We made a reservation online and were forgotten by the hostess...we approached the hostess about our table, they apologized and sat us immediately. We then went on to have a wonderful experience! Couldn't have asked for better service from our server Jeff on our anniversary. The table was sprinkled with rose petals, and we were promptly greeted by the manager DJ. The only complaint is that we ordered a medium-rare Tomahawk steak. We received it cooked as Medium, if the steak was any less quality it would have been ruined. Luckily it was still somewhat tender and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I've only been for happy hour but it was an excellent happy hour! Great selection of food and great drinks. Server was friendly and prompt and didn't mind my dietary restriction. My boyfriend ordered the happy hour burger and raved about it as I loved my crab blt which I ordered without the blt. This is definitely a happy hour go to!"}
{"text":"09/14/10

My first visit to Ruth Chris' and I have to say \"not bad, not bad at all!\"  I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables, yet not too stuffy, intimate bar area, but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low (great for conversation or working w/ a laptop).  Bartender was not too aloof, yet eager to answer any question when I had any.  

Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris' HH (happy hour) menu, yet?  There's a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it, I'm surprised I haven't been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes, I decided I'd try the burger, which I'd like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost, it was worth it!

Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty, topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese, some partially-melted (oh my!), on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch, which was great in the short-term, but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories I'd normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!

BTW, I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty, good stuff!"}
{"text":"We celebrated restaurant week in Madison by both of us having their special  steak dinner package.  The service we received was outstanding.

I had Caesar salad and my wife had Steakhouse salad. Both were excellent.  

We both ordered the petite filet with my wife's being medium rare and mine medium.  I was promised that medium meant a hot pink center.  The two steaks that were served were identical and medium rare.  When I pointed this out to the server she did not complain and she took my steak away. The assistant manager brought the same steak back to me; however, it was cut into more pieces and it resembled dog food kibble.  Since my wife was virtually finished with her steak, I complained no further and just ate the steak. It was very tasty but it had a poor presentation.  For the prices they charge, I was appalled that they just did not bring me a new steak that was cooked properly.  

Each of us also ordered the side order of mushrooms that were buttery and delicious.  

For dessert we each had the fresh berries served in a complex vanilla cream sauce. It was also very tasty. 

The restaurant is extremely expensive.  Had it not been for this $35 promotional meal, a similar meal with full size portions would easily cost $80 to $100 per person."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the basement of the building, you'd have to click R in the elevator to get to the floor.

The service was amazing, our waiter was very friendly and helpful. 

We ordered the valentine's day special, which was a set course of 3 items. I ordered the ahi tuna as the appetizer, the 11 oz rib eye for main and the set dessert option. 

The ahi tuna was okay, a bit dry and soaked in wasabi infused dip. 

The Rib eye tasted amazing, however, it was completely lacking on the presentation side. It was served over a sizzling hot plate of oil/butter, but when you put hot food over oil/butter, it just splatters everywhere. Basically my plate was a mosaic of butter and oil stains over a white plate. 

Overall, I think the steak itself was great, however, would i pay that kind of pricing for that presentation? Maybe not."}
{"text":"This is a strong 4* to say. Great steak with baked potato. Had a house steak house salad with a great Mustard Vinaigrette dressing. The steak was sizzling hot & cooked to perfection. Had a side of hot mushrooms & a couple of grilled shrimp. This was a solid meal with great service which you pay for, cause it's not a cheap proposition"}
{"text":"Happy Hour rocks!  My family stopped here before going to see a show downtown. We sat in the bar for Happy Hour menu. I had the crab beignets and zucchini fries, my husband had the burger and fries. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food and happy hour made it affordable for us. Still their high end service and atmosphere in the bar, just happy hour pricing. Of course, I had to try a Pomegranate Martini...yumm.   I would love to return for dinner on some romantic evening. Don't be put off by \"reserved\" signs on bar tables during happy hour. They don't take Happy Hour reservations; the signs are just to help them control the flow of traffic Just ask a waiter or hostess and you can take one of the tables. We easily got a table for 6 at 4:30."}
{"text":"We called ahead for reservations on a Friday night. We asked for a 7:30 dining time for a party of two. They said they couldn't accommodate us but they had a 6:45, we took it....
We arrived at 6:45 and the gigantic dining room was about 80% empty... when we left after our dinner.... about 8:00.... the dining room was about 50-60% empty...... I wasn't sure why they couldn't seat us at our requested time.
Having said that.... the service was good and the food was excellent.
The spicy lobster appetizer was AMAZING!!!!! Love Love Love!!!!!! We ordered a second one after inhaling the first one in record time.
I had the Ruth's chopped salad which I didn't care for..... it was more like cold slaw than a salad.....The dressing was so heavy and creamy.... or should I say mayonnaiseeeeeee it completely overwhelmed the flavor of any vegetables lying beneath!
I had the veal osso buco ravioli as my entree and it was delicious! Ravioli stuffed full of shredded tenderer meat and mozzarella with a fabulous white wine demi glace and they brought warm, fresh bread.... YUM!!!
My husband had the bone-in filet... he devoured it. Was not crazy about the lobster mac and cheese, have had better elsewhere, there sides are a little lacking, Entrees are great , and you definitely can't go wrong with about everything on the appetizer menu!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I don't eat steak.  I hate steak. My parents have ruined steak for me and I refuse to eat anything that even resembles steak.  Well, my boyfriend said that if I ever would like to reconsider steak that he would bring me here.  So I agreed finally.

Ruth's Chris Steakhouse has forever changed the way I look at steak!  It was moist, not rubbery and chewy and it was very flavourful.  I got mine medium well and it was actually medium well and not well done even though it was a petit mignon.  I might actually have reconciled with steak because of this experience.

The service was fast, friendly and not too over the top or pushy for a fancy place. We also tried the shoe-string fries and the lamb ravioli, which were both fantastic! I do have a higher standard for more expensive restaurants and this place definitely meets them."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Chris Ruth for our anniversary . It was the first time  i'd ever been there. He did make a resv and told them it was our anniversary , they had rose petals on the table. Nice touch. We aren't drinkers so we only had bottled water ( 2 large) and lemonade. My hubby had stuffed chicken breast, mashed pot and a tomato soup as a starter. I had a steak with aug potatoes. We also had shrimp cocktail.Biggest shrimp I've ever seen :)    ( 1 to share). We had a little dessert to share, the plate said Happy anniversary  in chocolate, nice touch. With tip our bill was $208.  The food tasted great. It was fun to go once and have that romantic dinner. But Texas roashouse steak tastes better, just saying...LOL We could have ate there 4 times for steak dinners for $208. But it still would NEVER had been as special as eating at Ruth Chris. Would we go again, knowing what it cost? Maybe for our next anniversary . 

Ps, $32 of our bill was the water and lemonade- so if you want the experience but need to cut cost- there you go:)"}
{"text":"My family lives out here in Arizona and me and my fiancee came here for her birthday. Showed up 25 minutes late because of an accident on the freeway and they didn't mind one bit. Nice as ever. The two Davids were our servers. Soooo nice. Recommended the chefs selection over a LA carte and saved us 65$. Unheard of. We aren't first time steak house eaters so it was a shock to hear a waiter recommend spending less money.
   So the food. I got the lobster bisque to start. Awesome. Then the 16 oz. Rib eye medium. Wow wow wow. Seriously, no lie. Better then the 33 oz. Bone in rib eye at mastros and 35$ less. Comes out on a 500 degree platewith butter sizzling. For my fiancee she got the petite filet with shrimp. Soo good and iI don't really care for small filets. We shared the lobster mac and cheese. Self explanatory. So much lobster 5 oz. Then the creamed spinach. And we shared the shrimp cocktail Zero complaints. And we are somewhat picky. Drinks were awesome. Strawberry basil giblet and for me my usual Jameson and ginger ale. 
  Dessert needs its own section. For me I try and get creme brulee anywhere I eat. This honestly tasted better than Mortons. She got the caramelized banana cream pie. Yea you read that right. The best ever.
  So in finishing chose ruth Chris and ask for the Davids to serve you. We were going to j&g at the Phoenician but steered cleared after seeing the horrible reviews and only the view being good. Plus 400$ dinner thats ehhh vs Ruth Chris at 201$? Why go anywhere else. Please take me serious I'm a 6'4\" 300 lb. Man. I've eaten. I don't ever write reviews but this place really stuck with me."}
{"text":"THE BEST FILET EVER!!! Everything about our dinner was AMAZING! The bread, entrees, drinks and sides!! I wish we had this place in my city! Well worth the price of you want a really nice dinner and a REALLY good steak!!!"}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar for dinner.  Great food and best staff in Charlotte.  Always very friendly and make an effort to remember your name and preferences.  Paige, Erin, David, Kristen and others set the standard..."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very classic steakhouse feel. I was staying at the Hilton Toronto, so it was very convenient to eat there. 

The service was excellent, with the wait staff taking a very \"classic\" approach to service.  The meat quality was also quite good. I ordered a medium filet mignon and it was tender enough to cut with a fork, even though it was cooked medium.

The oysters rockefeller were just mediocre. I've had better. The side dishes were pretty good.

Overall I would say it is a good chain steak restaurant, and would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"We had Caesar the waiter in the bar.  He made the night so splendid. Had us cRacking up even before we sat down funny and knowledgable about things. Friendly and pleasant 

Try the happy hour and ask for Caesar :)"}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to a nice dinner out with my husband, and Ruth's Chris seemed to be a good choice given all of the hype I'd heard about it from friends who had visited other locations.

When we were seated, our server poured our waters and managed to get some in the glass as the ice chunks splashed puddles onto our tablecloth.  Our server was nice enough, but not extremely attentive overall.

I ordered a bottle of wine, and 10 minutes later was presented a different bottle of wine. I decided to keep that bottle because I have enjoyed it before and I didn't want to wait for another bottle.  Once our glasses were poured, it was another 20-ish minutes before the server came to check on us again- I ended up pouring my own wine because I didn't want to wait any longer.

My husband (Vegetarian) had the terrific option (sarcasm meter going off) of choosing any 3 sides. Come on RC, a $50/plate restaurant can't keep some pasta noodles in the pantry and throw together a nice veggie and pasta dish? I understand we were at a steak house, but it would have been nice to provide an option other than a bunch of sides disguised as an entree.

My \"medium\" steak came out well done, and the wrong veggies were delivered with my husband's 'entree'.  Fortunately they fixed the error quickly, but given the series of errors, it was beginning to get ridiculous.

Eventually the manager walked by who was very kind and pleasant to speak with.  He seemed genuinely concerned about our satisfaction and apologized for the many errors we endured.

As we waited for our check, our server brought over a piece of chocolate cake with \"Thank you\" written in chocolate, as an apology from the manager.  Now this cake, was probably one of the most amazing desserts I have ever eaten.  Very rich, very decadent, and enough for two of us to easily share- the cake, was the stuff dreams are made of!  I wanted to come back to the restaurant later that evening just to get another piece of that cake (I didn't do it- but the thought genuinely crossed my mind!).  That gesture of good will has changed my mind from a \"will never return\" to a \"we might give RC a second chance after all.\""}
{"text":"I love steak, I love steakhouse, and I hated Ruth's Chris.

Why did I hate it?  Abuse of the brand.  I went to a financial presentation, the hook is that they give you a free dinner.  Thinking it had to be a good deal because it was at Ruth's Chris was my mistake.  I knew it would be a cheaper degraded menu to manage costs.  I didn't realize Ruth's Chris would allow you to go so low and to do such a poor job delivering on it.

What was the food?  6oz of a sirloin or whatever with 'king' shrimp on it (they showed us the menu for a scant second, I assume to keep us from leaving once we saw what was in store).  This was small and had some shrimp on it.  What they left out was the flavor - the shrimp was overcooked as was the steak.  There were 6 people at my table, no less than half the steaks were overcooked.  Not overcooked slightly so I am being very picky, but so overcooked people left large portions of a 6oz steak on the plate.

If you are willing to serve food worse than a TGI Fridays to people then you really can't claim to be a good restaurant.  I would have gladly fed my meal to a dog, it wasn't rancid or harmful.  It was just a terrible execution of an incredibly cheap menu.  Ruth's Chris was complicit with duping the guests of the retirement advisers.

The salad - it was worse than a pizza parlor salad.  It was iceberg lettuce in little tiny pieces, many of which were brown on the edges.  It had a flavorless olive oil (couldn't even detect vinegar) dressing.  On your plate you had 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, two pieces of arugula, and a single (not two or three) but a single sliver of onion.  The amount of iceberg lettuce was also very scant - interesting that with a mere handful of iceberg lettuce they managed to brown so much of it.

You can't have it both ways - claim to be a fancy steakhouse and then offer things unbecoming of a steakhouse."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant for the first time. All my east coast family members say it's amazing. Well it is NOT GOOD in Scottsdale AZ I ordered petite filet Oscar style. I also asked for it to be rare and he told me it's cold inside so I said to make it med rare with more toward rare. My husband ordered medum My steak was well on outside and medium rare hot center. 

When I called waiter Alejandro over, he practically argued with me and told me to move the crab off my steak and cut in center. He pulled out a flash light and shined it on my steak! When . He may have disagreed  with me but I'm the customer. I was so mad I just told him it it's fine and leave it. I left my steak mostly, my husbands steak was rare and just like I wanted it. service was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. What a waste of time..forget the money, it's the principal!

Don't waste your money
Oh by the way, I forgot to say that I called to ask if I can come a little earlier than my reservation. They said no, which was fine. But when we got there early anyway there were so many available tables. What a crock of a place."}
{"text":"It was our first time dining here. Rating is based solely on the steak.

Food and service were within expectation. Restaurant was cozy with dim lighting. Servers and staff were friendly. Overall a great dining experience! We got the Valentine's Day menu. 

Bread and butter: So good! Too many pieces for 2 people but we finished them nonetheless because they were warm and fluffy.
Appetizer: Caesar Salad + Seared Ahi Tuna. Both were great!
Steak: The main agenda and the reason we decided on this place. Got the 8oz filet mignon and the 16oz New York Strip. The 8oz was perfectly done as how I liked it (medium rare). The 16oz was done perfectly as well (medium rare), but it had too much fat that made it too greasy.
Sides: Sauteed mushrooms + Lyonnaise Potatoes. Both were great as well. Huge portions though!
Dessert: Chocolate Cheesecake and Dessert Sin Cake. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Ruth's Chris. I absolutely love coming here it is always a great experience. 

First the ambiance;
The restaurant is very beautiful and clean :) You walk into a hostess area where they great you and refer to you by last name. They are quick and efficient. The tables have table clothes and cloth napkins. The bathrooms are in tip top shape as well, with a full length mirror to adjust your nice clothes you are asked to wear.

The service;
We were seated by a hostess who immediately noticed my date and I were wearing black. When were seated she replaced our white napkins with black ones so we did not have lint on our clothes. I thought that was the most generous thing. It seems small but it was awesome that they even thought of something like that. They cleared off the other two settings and we were brought out bread and water. Our waiter was kind and efficient. I ordered iced tea and I use sweet n low in it. The cup of sweeteners was low on sweet n low but I only use 1 per glass so I was not ready to ask for more. When he brought me a refill, in a new glass not filled at my table, he replaced the sweetener bowl with another full of sweet n low. I didn't even have to ask for more he had already noticed. The attention to detail was so impressive. 

The food;
The food is outstanding. I ordered the stuffed chicken on both of m visits and I like to refer to it as \"chicken stuffed full of heaven\". The dishes come out nice and hot as well as separate sides. If you want to share a side it is completely possible, they bring you out a boat of mashed potato's!! I try not to eat too much bread and salad because I want to eat my entire main course :) My date had a steak which was delicious as well. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and warm the entire meal.

The price;
You will notice that this is not a cheap restaurant. The experience and the food is worth every penny. I am a strong believer that if you are paying a high price the food and the service should be impeccable, and it was. 

I love coming to Ruth's Chris. The price is a little high so I do not get to endulge as much as I would like but I make it worth it each time I am able to go!!"}
{"text":"Love the steaks here! Service is always A+"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with a group of about 20.  Overall good, but not great.  Most notable was the macaroni and cheese that they served the kids; it had jalapeno in it, which doesn't really make sense for kids.  Servers were helpful and professional."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars my first time here in NC and I heard good things about this place my expectations were very high, but the went down way to fast..... They sat us at the bar for 25 mins without even showing me a menu..... Very unacceptable, two of our co-workers came in after us and they were presented with a menu before our group of 6 people immediately after we stood up..... Just to let let you know I was out here for training for the Hendrick auto group corporation.... Very unhappy customer... I came to del friscos instead and I got treated like queen.."}
{"text":"I will admit that I was hesitant to come given that this is a chain but I am glad that I did.  The decor is nice, nothing amazing but the food and service is perfection.  I would recommend that you go now while they have their summer deal which is salad steak side and dessert for $45.  The steak is still the same quality of their regular filet just 6oz instead of 8 which is still plenty.  The sizzling plates def make the meal.  The sides are still the large tureen so more than enough.   Overall among the best steaks I've had.  I would most def recommend going to Ruth's chris."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Ruth's Chris restaurant and even though I was reasonably happy with my food, the overall experience did not live up to my expectations. It was a good meal but not worth the money. Our total bill for two (including drinks, tax, and tip) was $200 and I think we could have had basically the same meal at The Keg or Flemings for half of that cost. Or, for equal money gone to a much swankier place like J&G or Capital Grille and had a really pampered experience and more impressive meal.

Coming up the elevator and entering the dining room, I was surprised that it was such a casual environment.  It could have been any family restaurant in a strip mall. I did not get an upscale steakhouse vibe at all. We were seated in a four-top in the center aisle and my chair got bumped several times by both servers and patrons. At some point one of them knocked my clutch purse off the table and then stepped on it which I didn't realize until much later. I have been to places (esp in NYC) where they crammed a lot more tables into a small space but there was something about the layout of Ruth's Chris that was just really awkward and uncomfortable. I am sure if you sat in a booth you wouldn't have this problem but you still would have to put up with the lackluster decor and barely there background music. Another thing that made me uneasy was that there was some woman (the manager?) standing not more from 10 feet from me staring intently into the dining room for the entire meal. Occasionally she would bark orders at the servers but I never saw her walk around and talk to any of the guests.

As for the food, we started with the calamari appetizer. It was cooked adequately, though a little too much breading for my taste, but the sauce it came with was amazing! It was like a sweet chili sauce and I could have drank a whole bottle of it. The only misstep was that they should have served it on the side rather than drizzling it on top since it made the breading get soggy. They brought out our salads before we had finished with the appetizer. This is a pet peeve of mine since I feel that when the pacing of courses is off it can really ruin the entire meal. But we both loved our salads; I had the Harvest Salad which was full of flavor and the hubby had his usual Caesar and he thought this was one of the best he'd had in a while. It had big chunks of shaved Parmesan in it which was cool. He ordered the cowboy ribeye and was pretty happy but he typically does like his steak unadorned with no condiments. Personally, I would have appreciated some seasoning besides butter on my petite fillet. As others have mentioned, both steaks came out cooked a little more than we had asked for but I think that is likely due to the super hot plates that keep the meat cooking after they are brought to the table. The odd thing was that the bleu cheese \"crust\" was really just bread crumbs and cheese crumbles spooned on top. It was not melted or seared in as I was expecting. I don't mind a well done steak so I enjoyed it but the lobster tail was a big disappointment. It too was a tad overcooked, but not so bad that it was inedible. However, the meat was extremely flavorless. Maybe it is because I am used to Maine lobster? Or maybe it was not fresh? One thing is for sure, the blackening spices mentioned in the description were no where to be found. It was an extremly bland entree. The highlight of the meal was probably the mashed potatoes we shared which were delicious! No complaints there. We finished our meals with dessert and coffee. I ate the chocolate and caramel cake that came with the Ruth's Classics meal. It was good, but had that fresh-from-the-fridge taste. The hubby ordered the caramelized banana cream pie and even though he didn't like the super hard pie crust (this dish also had been in the fridge way too long) he did like the flavor of the banana pudding center. We both had two drinks each, he had beer and I had martinis and we were surprised to see how pricey those were. I don't mind paying $12-14 for a specialty drink but I have never paid that for a basic gin martini. Also I specifically asked for the bleu cheese stuffed olives but these were forgotten on the first round.

Our waiter was a friendly and funny guy but as the other reviewers have mentioned, there was a little bit of rushing us along while ordering and also some nudges to up sell at various points. Overall, it was the same service I would expect at an Outback or someplace similar but just not to the level of this price point. Which is basically what I would say about the food and whole experience. I wouldn't refuse to eat here again because I think you could have a more economical meal if you skipped the drinks and ordered the Ruth's Classics complete meal which is starter, entree, side, and dessert for only $42.95. But this place is not worth spending more than that so I wouldn't recommend it when there are so many better steakhouses in town."}
{"text":"I am a lover of all things steak it's my favorite food. So when I started to eat @ Ruth in California, San Diego that is I fell in love. I have had a birthday dinner there and many of dinners just because.... My daughter's feel that their calamari is the best. I am sucker for a mid rare steak. The prices and service is worth the treat."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris did not meet my expectations.  The food was good but, not excellent and certainly not worth the $200 that the bill came to for one cocktail, 1 appetizer, 2 small steaks, one side and 2 glasses of wine. No complaints about the service or the atmosphere. That was fine. However, for the money, I would go to Donovan's or Omaha Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Steak is on par with other Ruth's Chris locations but the ambiance (there is an ambiance in this place?) is horrible. Light is too bright, the chairs are uncomfortable and it seems they don't have a private room because they have a huge group of what looks like a family reunion/birthday and kids are everywhere, and the noise level destroyed my and boyfriend's enjoyment of the meal. 

Even the building this is in seems like a commercial/corporate building; no character at all. One good thing is their valet is free.

Will not go back to this location. I'll stick with Ruth's Chris in Woodland Hills and Beverly Hills."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Ruth Chris. My first was in SF and it was 5 stars. This time was only 4, everything else was great service, sides, appetizer. But the steak was not as flavorful this time. It was cooked perfectly.

Appetizer was seafood gumbo and that was yummy! The house garlic bread and the cheese bread was excellent. The creamed spinach was great as the the mash potatoes. I am really disappointed.

Del frisco's across the street will be next."}
{"text":"They recently brought back their bone-in Filet..... Wow exquisite cut!! Also really happy about their Crab legs!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Ruth Chris that I've ever been to. Out waiter was Brian and he had a horrible attitude. There were three of us seated at 5:15 pm, mind you, they open at 5:00 PM so it wasn't busy AT ALL. We sat ourselves. It took him 10 minutes for him to walk over to us and ask if we were eating. We told him that we were and he walked away to bring menus. He never once mentioned that it was happy hour. Luckily we knew and requested a happy hour menu. As a reminder, there were three of us and he brought ONE happy hour menu. We had to ask him to bring us water and he never checked on us at all while we ate. We spoke with the manager in regards to the horrible service that we were receiving from Brian and her response was \"I'll have a talk with him.\" Worst customer service we have ever had. Would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed w the taste of food last night. My crab cake was so salty, I feel like I just have a spoon full of salt in my mouth. My salad was alright. My steak was a little overcooked, but the king crab was good."}
{"text":"We had 2 Ruth Chris steakhouses in Vegas for years. Then they both closed . A year later this one opened up. I was looking forward to have same good steak. Ordered cowboy, much smaller then in the past. Mushrooms  out of a can I think, no flavor. (in past was wild mushrooms in garlic sauce). Venetian (delmonicos) or steak house at Circus Circus much better"}
{"text":"Love when servers introduce themselves. Our servers name is Jessica and her assistant is Christian. I loved how she welcomed us by our names (we made a reservation lol).

Jessica has been attentive to our table. Checking in after we received our cocktails, after we received our app.  

When our meal arrive, we had a filet split and when Jessica saw the middle and noticed it wasn't cooked to what we ordered she said without asking us that she would get it fixed. I've never experience a server taking that initiative to get your order correct without you asking to have it fixed.

Overall the experience was good not great so that's why it wasn't a 5 star rating but I would recommend this place to others based on the service alone."}
{"text":"I gave one of my employees a gift card for this establishment for Christmas and I would like to thank this restaurant for the job they did!  My top salesperson and his wife were ecstatic over the food and the service when they called me the next day!  So sad that the idiot from Monterrey, Ca was unhappy but, it's a jerk California liberal who posted!  Go home loser!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this Ruth's Chris! The restaurant itself was very cool! Clean and classy. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and delicious! By the time I was done eating bread thick with butter, calamari, BBQ shrimp, cowboy cut ribeye, brussel sprouts (best I've had)!, lyonnaise potatoes, and creamed spinach I was stuffed, fat and happy!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ruth's Chris I've ever been to. I've been to two in Maui and two in Sacramento, and this was my best experience.
You just can't beat a Ruth's Chris steak, and this location was no exception. My ribeye was killer. The scallops on the menu caught my eye, but I couldn't bring myself to order them in lieu of steak, so the waiter let me add a side of them! They were perfectly seasoned and seared. Probably the best steak and the best scallops I've ever had. 
Our drinks and sides were good, as always.
They brought a beautiful chocolate dessert for our anniversary. 
Our service was legendary! Our waiter made appropriate recommendations and was quick to serve us, but not too chatty so we could enjoy an intimate meal.
WHEN I return, I will ask to be seated by the windows so we can have a better view of the strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out Ruth's Chris this weekend for Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week. It was good.

First, we parked in the attached garage and they validated it for only $5. 

Food was good. My caesar salad was pretty tasty and huge. Steaks were good and cooked well. I ordered the sweet potato casserole and it was delicious and really sweet. Basically tasted like dessert.

Desert was meh. Vanilla ice cream and apple cheesecake. Everything was $40."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this restaurant.  The food is not bad by any stretch, but it is not of the quality I expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputation.

I ordered the special, which for me consisted of a house salad, ribeye, creamed spinach, and dessert.  I also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese bread.

The garlic cheese bread was very good.  The escargot was flavorful, but I was hoping for escargot served in the shell (like I had in Paris).  The ribeye was cooked perfectly, but the cut seemed to be of average quality.  The creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland.  The dessert was good.

The only reason I ate here is because I had a $100 gift card to spend.  Overall, it was definitely worth it because of the $100 discount.  However, I have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in Las Vegas to try."}
{"text":"I went there for a private event organized by a tech company for lunch.  (they are usually not open for lunch otherwise)

Atmosphere (3 stars):
We were placed in a long room where there were about 60 people.  It was very cramped and the presentation was on the far side of the room, making it hard to hear everything.
The actual restaurant is pretty hidden, without clear signs on how to get to it.  You have to go down the escalator, and go around a few corners.  

Food: (4 stars)
We got Caesar salad for appetizer (it had way too much dressing) and the salad was not crispy.  (2 stars)
I ordered a swordfish steak, it was very well made (5 stars)
For desert there was a chocolate cake, it was a bit overwhelming in flavour, would not recommend it.  (3 stars)

Service: (4 stars)
The service was friendly, however due to the room structure they were sometimes hard to get a hold of.  


Overall, I would go there again, but would skip the appetizer and the desert. I would not recommend hosting a professional event there as the spacing is not great for presentations"}
{"text":"Nowhere NEAR the location in Niagara Falls. The service was great but the food isn't nearly as good. We did the $99 new years dinner. My 8oz steak was \"okay\" but my lobster tail was pointless...dry and flavorless...I didn't even finish it. The Ribeye on the other hand was great but not as perfect as Niagara. Also, we both ordered medium...but mine came out Medium-Well and the Ribeye came out Well. This is unacceptable when you are going to charge these prices. If it wasn't for the service, I would burned this place down. Also being seated 30 mins after our reservation wasn't very helpful towards their rating."}
{"text":"The steak was nice after our flight from LA. I ordered the Rib eye med-rare and split a side of mashed potatoes and mushrooms. We had a chopped salad as an appetizer.  Everything the delicious, absolutely nothing to complain about. Food was great, as well as the service. We each had 2 pints of the Steam Whistle beer and we loved it. I like a beer this crisp and light and this was perfect."}
{"text":"Can you say disappointment?? That would summarize my review of Ruth's Chris Southpark. Why am I so specific, well, because I've been to other locations and as a result, expect MUCH better. 
This is restaurant week in Charlotte, and YES, restaurants are busy. We booked in to this location for my wifes birthday because she LOVED the downtown location when we did this last year (also during restaurant week). Let me just say, when we went to the downtown location last year, it was one of the best dining experiences EVER!! 
Southpark location, not so much! :(
It started out with a 45 minutes wait at the door. We had an 8:15 reservation, but waited until nearly 9:00pm before being seated. The plus... the hostess gave us all a glass of champagne. The minus... there really wasn't a good place to wait!
When we finally did get seated, it continued to go downhill. Our server (Jon/John?) was not terribly attentive. (Something we did NOT experience downtown!) We seldom saw him and when waiting for him... we really waited! My wife ordered a glass of wine. We were well into the first course before she received it. Oh and did I mention that the salad dressing my wife received for my salad was wrong! And since it took so long for our server to appear (about the time the wine arrived), the rest of the party was halfway through their appetizers! When we told the waiter, no appology... just off he went and got her the correct salad dressing. 
So, on to the main course. FIRST ... NONE of the steaks came in the famous Ruth's Chris 1800 degree sizzling manner! In fact my steak (More on this in a minute) looked like it had been sitting for some time. Now, I had a wonderful Filet Mignon.. the problem with that was, I ORDERED  a NY strip! I had thought about sending it back, but based on how our experience to this point, I certainly was NOT going to take the time wait for another steak while my party waited!!!! 
My wife at the petite Filet. Overdone. She ordered a medium. It came VERY well done. Her comment, which to me was priceless... \"I could have gotten this at Western Sizzlin!\" Now, I'm not a Western Sizzlin hater, but somehow I just expected better fro Ruth's Chris!  
Do you want to hear MORE?? 
When the bus boy came, he spilt corn on my wifes gift and our guests jacket as he cleared the table. 
And as I sit here composing this, drinking my lovely hot coffee, I think back to the almost warm coffee I was served last night. 
To sum it up... disappointment! I KNOW they can do better, but they totally failed last night! 
Next year... maybe we'll try downtown again... or move to Del Frisco, Morton, Palm ...SOMEBODY must want our business!"}
{"text":"Very good steaks, but very pricey. There are other places that serve meat that is just as good at prices that are more in line."}
{"text":"6ounce filet with mashed potato is one of their signature items so they should do it well, right? Wrong.
It was beyond charred. I notice that it was full of fat and grizzle so perhaps they burn it so you don't notice.
My friend got oil on his shirt from the plate from the way the waiter served it and all he got was \"oooops sorry!!\"
For the $100 we paid for 2 (no alcohol) this must be a practical joke. This is not a fine dining restaurant. The restaurant was mostly empty but the table next to us was 4 loud guys who told the waiter they had Ruth's gift cards/complimentary cards (sorry forgot which one exactly) from Costco.. yes Costco...

Deinitely Hy's is more delicious, classier and the food is much much better (not that Ruth's is good). If you cannot afford Hy's just go to the Keg. At least at The keg your mashed potato is not lumpy.

All I can say that is not negative is the hostess was polite and they have a low light and nice ambiance (if you are not asked to sit next to four guys talking about Costco)."}
{"text":"We were here for the restaurant opening event and booked a private room for our entire group. Blew $2K on dinner that night. Yes there were some good memories."}
{"text":"I don't mind paying for great steaks and great service - I've just had better.  The view of the strip is awesome from this location, one of the best in Vegas.  Steaks were good, not great.  Sides were some of the worst sides I've had.  The creamed spinach had a barn flavor to it.  No seriously it tasted just like a barn smells, leave the hay for horses.  Weird.  Also the asparagus came out looking yellow and limp.  The manager came by the table and we told them how disappointed we were in the sides - so he did take 1/2 off.  There are a lot of steak houses in Vegas, so I will be trying a different one next time. (Maybe I've just been spoiled by the excellent steakhouses we have in Denver - where Ruth's Chris just recently closed it's location)"}
{"text":"I took my dad to Ruth's Chris for his birthday on a Saturday night (they're only open for dinner, except on Fridays where they offer lunch as well).
 
The outside of the restaurant doesn't look too great with construction going on but the inside is a completely different atmosphere. Inside, the windows are tinted and there's classical music playing in the background so none of the noise from outside disturbs diners.
 
Once inside, the first thing I noticed was that the service definitely was not friendly. They were, in a sense, professional... but no one really smiled and they made it clear by how they carried themselves that they were only doing what they're doing because it's their job.
 
The menu is really limited too--just 3 pages worth of actual food items. Anyways, I went with the Ruth's Classic--Steak House Salad, 6 oz. Filet & Shrimp, Fire-Roasted Corn, Strawberry Shortcake--and my dad got the New York Strip Steak. I have no complaints about the food whatsoever and the steaks came sizzling as promised. As you can probably tell by various other reviews, their dishes are their strong point.
 
The only thing is that if I'm paying around $60/person, I expect good service to accompany it... and the service here was so bland that I probably would never go back. If you're looking for a good steakhouse for more reasonable prices, definitely go to Cagney's in Streetsville instead."}
{"text":"Charlotte agenda mentioned a deal where you could get a $83 gift card for $53.  We had purchased that because I had never been to Ruth Chris.

My husband made reservations for my  birthday which seems like a great time to use the gift card.  

We were running a little late but we're still seated immediately.  

Our server was incredible.  We had bread and waters in no time.

As a special treat for my birthday they brought out champagne  for a toast.  This was a nice touch.

We ordered the blueberry mojito with vodka.  It was sooooooo delicious and refreshing.  I ended up ordering another one.

We split a salad, the New York strip, and shoestring fries.  Everything was really good but I would get something different than the strip next time it was a little rich for me.  My husband love it though.

For dessert they brought out a little cheesecake and chocolate it was so nice.  

There is a happy hour menu if you sit at the bar and Ruth Chris publishes all of their nutrition."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan.

My bride and I went to RC recently and had a fantastic meal!  The salads were fantastic, the steak was perfect to order, and dessert was perfection!

I personally prefer my plate not to be warm because I don't want it to keep cooking and they had no problem catering to our preferences.  

I recommend the chocolate cake as the finisher.  Wow it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"DEL to the ICIOUS!!! Absolutely hands down the BEST food I have ever had!! This steak house is well known to natives and its definitely worth the pretty penny it costs to eat there! The restaurant itself is set up upstairs with a seating, bar, and patio area. The atmosphere is very romantic and peaceful. Outside you have a nice view of the sunset and inside the ambiance is very relaxing. Each employee was very courteous and respectful. I loved our waiter the most!!! We were out celebrating my birthday and he brought over a little baggy that was filled with little pieces of confetti and spread it around our table to make it a little more \"birthday festive\" for me. Each person who came to our table wished me a happy birthday; it was very sweet that they went out of their way to make the occasion a little more special. The food was moist, hot, and above all nothing short of perfect! The chicken I ordered was basically injected with heaven, I cant describe it any other way! My taste buds went bananas! The combination of the atmosphere, the staff, the food and the company I was dining with, the evening was fantastic! Last but not least our waiter surprised me with a free piece of their delicious chocolate cake with Happy Birthday writing. My boyfriend didn't even have to ask (Like most restaurants) they just brought it out automatically after dinner! No singing, so other guest weren't disturbed, just a Happy Birthday note with cake, it was awesome! I will definitely be going back as soon as I can (im going to start celebrating my birthday every month! HAHA!) I will be recommending it to all my family and friends! Ruth Chris keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Superior service,  amazing views,  and one of a kind experience. When you first come in to the casino you take a special elevator just for the restaurant then your greeted by awesome staff. The view overlooking the strip is beautiful especially when enjoyed at night...The menu delights in all that is offered. Each course proving better than the last. The cuts of steak are cooked to sheer perfection. The sides are equally as delectable. This restaurant makes for a special dining experience."}
{"text":"Waitress was fantastic. Steaks were stringy tough. Pretty unimpressed since we decided on this place to celebrate an aniversary. Should of stuck with Binions."}
{"text":"Chewy steak! Tried their filet mignon and it was chewy! Full of cartilage and sinews! Disappointing filet."}
{"text":"Want good steak? This is the place!  Pricey but it's worth it!

I had some filet mignon thing with alsakan crab legs or something like that (it's been while!) but the meat was so tastey and the crab meat melted in my mouth. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner one night. We got valet parking which is so awesome. The hostesses were very friendly and told us where to go. Our servers was very friendly. I got the filet. It was cooked perfectly. We also got mashed potatoes as a side item. It was so smooth and buttery. We also got the creamed spinach. It was good but not my favorite. The bread was also good. Overall, the experience was pretty enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner last night. We try to eat at a Ruth's Chris whenever we travel to a city where one is located. Ruth's is very special to us since we ate at the original on Broad street in Nola every Sunday night over 30 years ago. 

Our waiter,  Nicole, was excellent. Very knowledgeable and professional. She was a major part of a fabulous evening. Thanks Nicole! We will definitely go back when we are in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"A must for steak houses to go in Las Vegas right at the middle of the strip. Husband and I are always going towards different directions how we want our steaks to be done but both ways were phenomenal. Staff are very professional and organized. Overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was excellent! Went for the steak came back for the chicken which was even better."}
{"text":"We had dinner November 4th and we wanted to love this place, but poor leadership prevents this! We arrived 10 minutes early for a table of 4 and the table wasn't ready, that was no big deal we waited in the bar area hoping to get a pre dinner drink! It's was Saturday night and they were packed, after waiting 20 minutes no drink! They had one bar tender! We finally were seated. Waited 10 minutes for water, waited 20 more minutes for drinks, this restaurant is plagued with poor service! My expectations for dinner for four and a $500 bill is good service!"}
{"text":"We come here quite often for dinner & happy hour... but this last time visit was horrible. Our server was very rude and disgusting. He belched a few times in front of us as he was getting our order and when he took our plates. After he took our order he wouldn't put it in right away he went to talk to his friend at the front. We would have to flag him down if we needed something & even then he forgot to get it and we would ask the guy serving us water, which he did a great job. I don't like going somewhere and paying good money to this kind of dinner. I don't like writing negative reviews, so I spoke with the manager there and told him what happened. He apologized and said he would like to send us a gift card for the inconvenience, which was such a sincere gesture, if it happened. Well it's been 6 week, and nothing. Thanks for the bad service and thanks for the empty promises. Won't be coming back. Btw this is the new location in downtown."}
{"text":"I would give my experience an A+...

I made my reservation directly with Ruth's Chris online system. I told them it was my wedding anniversary and I would love a table with a view.  When we arrived (30 minutes late due to traffic) we were seated at a table with a great view of the strip and our table had rose pedals on it in celebration of our anniversary.

We were quickly greeted by Angie who called us by our last names which was a nice touch.  Her assistant (name started with an A) was EXTREMELY  helpful and VERY funny. We really enjoyed his sense of humor. We split everything except for the steak and we were not made to feel bad about it.

We had...

Cowboy Ribeye
Petit Filet 
Cesar Salad - split and it was enough for two people (ask for anchovies)
Baked potato - split and it was enough for two, my husband just wanted butter but Angie brought the 'loaded part' on the side for me 
Dirty Absolut Martini for me

We were surprised when Angie brought us a cheese cake on a plater that had Happy Anniversary written on it - Free

Our total bill was $179 and with a 20% tip came out to $211

We didn't over eat by getting two many sides and we could not have been more happy with the service that was provided.  The manager came to our table and asked how everything was which was a nice touch.

If you are celebrating something special I highly recommend Ruth's Chris in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We visited during restaurant week, so my review is probably a little different than other people's.  

But, I thought the food was great, the steak was perfectly cooked and the service was fantastic.  I am thinking there might be some qualifiers if I had paid full price for all of my 3 courses.  But since I didn't, I have nothing to complain about.  This was acually my first time at any Ruth's Chris.  

The tomato/crab soup was fantastic and the bread pudding was HUGE.  I would definitely be back to try the full menu based on my experience."}
{"text":"RC without a doubt is the best steakhouse I have ever been to.   I have dined at over ten of their locations.    Never let down, always the best from start to finish.  The steaks are served on a 500 degree plate and the taste  is unbelievable.   The prices are high, but the whole experience is worth it.   Staff is super friendly,  my only complaint is,  I don't get to go as much as we used to."}
{"text":"pretty ok.

out of the steakhouses i went to in downtown charlotte this was the 2nd best. not incredibly fantastic but not horrible. i'd go there again if i was hungry and didn't care about anything fancy. the service is ok, the food is ok, the ambiance is ok. at least you wont get food poisoning from this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Enjoyed the 4-course meal including the the 16 oz rib eye, rare. Wow!  Totally delicious with grilled asparagus. Never had better."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner because I could never justify shelling out this much for dinner on my own. I was excited to try the famous Ruth's Chris! 
Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Almost everything lacked seasoning and nothing felt like something I couldn't get for half the price somewhere else. There were a couple of standouts, like the hollandaise sauce on the asparagus and the key lime pie, but everything else was underwhelming to say the least. The service was good and the atmosphere was too, but it just didn't do it for me. I guess for  a high price tag I'm expecting a bit more."}
{"text":"We have always been fans of Morton's and Ruths Chirs. Tonight we found out that Mortons on Camelback is closed. Decided on Ruths Chirs as we have been there many times. Such disappointment, the bartender was rude and the shoestring fries were limp and greasy although the steak was really delicious. I am not a naysayer but even the people next to us at the bar commented on the bartenders bad attitude. So sorry but would have rather hung out at Mortons with the ever welcoming bartenders!!!! Come one R.C. lighten up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time visiting this location. The first time was during restaurant week a few years ago.  This time my friends and I attended on New Year's Eve 2017 for my  friend's daughter 21st birthday. The service and food was great! We did not have to wait.  The restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas. I ordered the stuffed chicken breast and green beans.  They were seasoned very good. They give you generous size portions.  One of my friends ordered the petite steak; the texture was too tough. The manager did a good job of making sure my friend got another steak that was to her expectations and he took it off her bill. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and location."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The cocktails were spot on and the food was outstanding. I got the petite filet which melted in my mouth and my friend got the lobster tail which was just as delicious. Definitely with it!"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, but the staff was so nice and answered all the questions about the food and they were very funny too! The food was delicious and tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"Overrated and overprice. Steaks was bit salty and portion was small. Service was not that good either as our waitress was as salty as the food. For much better experience and food at similar price range, go to Chima across the street, or Capital Grille couple of blocks away or do."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding experience! There's a reason why it's a top notch restaurant. Classy, clean and the service is impeccable (You rock, Adam! LOL we had fun!)

Our group of three decided last minute to use up a $150 gift card here that's been in my wallet for years. I just never think to go to Ruth's Chris. It's out of the way, being downtown, and it's just not a regular 'swing in for a bite' place. But on a girl's road trip to Calgary (from Edmonton, where we also have a downtown RC), we were grabbing drinks downtown and were yelping to see where our next stop would be. On a whim, and a gift card, we checked and made a reservation at Ruth's Chris for about half an hour, giving us time to pay for our drinks and walk to the restaurant. It was a Saturday night, and thankfully we didn't have trouble getting in for 6pm. We got an amazing booth overlooking the busy Calgary streets and perused the menus.

Wow the prices are high.  And there's a lot of American Beef. We have the best beef in the world in our own back yard, and they fly corn fed beef in. I don't get it. 

Anyway, we get the Canadian Petite Filets, a potatoes gratin and a Brussels spout veggie to share. Two of us got seafood topper, and all of us got drinks. With our $150 gift card, each of us threw in at least $50 on top of that to cover the overage, tax and tip! Anyway, the filet was perfect and rare, and just melted in the mouth. But for $46 just for the meat, I wouldn't expect anything else.

The service though! Wow! On top of things! While my friends made a quick trip to the washroom, they came back and re-folded their napkins! I guess that's what you're paying for there. 

This place is not cheap. While it's pretty, I'd rather hit a Chop or even a Keg, which proudly support Alberta beef. Unless I have a gift card. Or someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Last time we were here was 2015 and it was excellent, 2 yrs. makes a difference. We were a party of 3 for a Saturday 7:15 reservation. The service remained the same along with the atmosphere. The food preparation the same (love the hot sizzling butter on everything), but the quality of steak seemed of a lower standard and the clientele very varied. When I'm sitting inside a fine dining, dining room and the guy at the table next to us is wearing shorts and an old t-shirt and sneakers and and on the other side a crying baby that the parents are ignoring and I'm paying $52 for a steak and dropping well over $200 on the bill I find it inexcusable.

Our server Jesse was excellent. We ordered cocktails while deciding the menu. I had the Tomato Blue Crab Soup appetizer. Entrees ordered was 2 New York Strip Steaks, Blue Crab Cakes and an order of Shoe String Fries and for dessert a complementary Anniversary celebration Apple Cheese Cake. The soup was delicious, only comment is that an Ice COLD Spoon should not be given with hot soup. The Crab Cakes, Fries and Steaks all prepared perfectly and again the quality of steak seemed a bit dry, not thick and juicy as our previous visit.

Will we be back again? Probably, but I will request NOT being seated next to any babies."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Johnny T (from Wisconsin) was a great waitor. Explained all of the dishes to us in detail and took exceptional care of us while we were here. 

One of our party was younger and didn't like the deserts offered by the restaurant. He personally went and found Oreos and brought them to us to make this member happy. He went above and beyond to make this experience the best it could possibly be. 10/10 would recommend Ruth's Chris and Johnny T."}
{"text":"Im a HUGE steak guy... Morning, Lunch, Dinner, bring it on. 
We started with some appetizers, Lobster and BBQ shrimp. They were honestly amazing and i recommend it to anyone that goes to Ruth Chris. I decided to have the NY Steak, Rare.
In all honesty, i was not woowwed that much.. Ive had better steaks elsewhere for half the price. BUT yes i know i gave it a 4 star and just because my steak wasn't orgasmic doesn't mean i will give Ruth Chris less credit. The fries are very normal and nothing to talk about and the shoe string fries are okay. The restaurant staff are just amazing and helpful and not once did i pour myself wine or ask for water. My waiter told me that the steaks come sizzling and asked me to hold my table cloth up while he sets it down so i don't get sizzling juice on my face loll thx for that. 

All in all i give it 4 stars because :

Wait time : 20 minutes and food was at my table
Staff : Just amazing and helpful
Food : Appetizers 5/5 Steak 3.5/5

{"text":"It is definitely an experience like no regular chain steak house. The service is exquisite and the steaks were cooked perfectly and juicy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a mediocre steak sandwich during happy hour. But the carpet is filthy and worn do expect to get more of this in the kitchen. Must be living on an old reputation : can't sustain these prices when the floor looks like a corner Greek diner in Chicago
Wait staff was wonderful"}
{"text":"Had a great  experience. Darcel was awesome. Better attitude than most Ruth Chris staff. Service was excellent. Even though it wasn't the best steak dinner we ever had we had a great time. Thanks Darcel!"}
{"text":"This place is my #2 goto steak house in the area.
I think 1 other place has slightly better steaks, although their prices are higher than Ruths.

Me and my wife have been here twice now. Both time we were satisfied with the service and the food.
I always get the NY Strip, cooked medium. This time, however, it was closer to medium well/well done. The steak managed to remain fairly juicy, so I didn't not request to send it back.
My wife had the filet, and hers was also slightly overdone.

The sides were perfection though. The Honey and bacon roasted brussel sprouts were amazing. The lyonnaise and rosemary herbed fingerling roasted potatoes were to die for.

And desert was delish as well. I had the White Chocolate bread pudding. Its not quite as amazing as another establishments \"Butter Cake\"..but it was still delish!

Overall, not bad.  Ruth's Chis will remain in our rotation."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic meal. A huge slab of meat cooked to perfection, served on a sizzling plate of butter! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

Made my reservation on Open Table, with a note about it being my friend's birthday. They brought her an extra dessert that said Happy Birthday Patti! Very nice touch, and a girl with 2 desserts on her birthday, is a happy girl!

Not really too much to add to what everyone else has said, except make sure to go during their Prime Time menu. About $60 for the salad or lobster bisque, steak and dessert. The warm apple crumble is SOOOO GOOOOOOOOD.

Lovely setting, and the wait staff is the best around."}
{"text":"What can you say about Ruth's Chris? I'm not a terribly sophisticated dude, so it would be ridiculous for me to pretend I wasn't blown away. I had managed to convince a wonderful girl named Loretta to go out with me a second time. I wasn't sure I'd get a third date from her, so I decided to go somewhere I loved. I chose Ruth's Chris because I ate at one in Kansas City and it was one of the finest meals I've ever had in my life.

I ordered the crab cake appetizer to share with my date. It is heaven on a plate. Two decently sized crab cakes made with jumbo lump blue crab meat. I hesitate to even call it a \"cake\" because there is almost no breading. It's basically a big pile of perfectly seasoned crab meat. Wonderful.

For the entree we both ordered steaks of course. Let me just stop at this point and express my joy at dating a girl who ordered a big ass steak and enjoyed it as much as I did. One of the great things about having a steak in a classy joint like this is ordering it all fancied up. I love steak Au Poive - that's with a black peppercorn cream sauce that is delicious. Luckily, Loretta knows enough French to let me know that it's pronounced O-pwav and not AW-pawv like I was saying it. I managed to learn how to say it correctly before I ordered it. Loretta saved me from looking like a complete dumbass in front of the waiter. Thanks Baby!

The steak was absolutely perfect. Cooked perfectly, tender and full of flavor. Everything is ala carte at Ruth Chris. I ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes and Loretta got the asparagus. Both were awesome. Well... I didn't try the asparagus, but she said it was good. I generally don't eat green veggies while there is still meat, potatoes or bread still on the table.

I'm sure there's some good desserts at Ruth's Chris, but we didn't even look at the menu. We were stuffed. What a great meal. Obviously it was expensive as hell, but worth every penny. I hate be so easy and hand out five stars on only my second Yelp review... but seriously, this place is fantastic. Of course, if you're one of those people that jet about the planet and dine in world class restaurants, you'll probably think this place is pathetic. Of course, if you're one of those people, you're probably not checking out Yelp to find a place to eat in Phoenix Arizona.

I had a great time and so did Loretta. I recommend this place for a second date. It got me a third, so it must be good!"}
{"text":"Oh Christ...really, I'm not a big steak fan but this place was RIDICULOUS. Went here on a recommendation (thanks Pete T.!) for my fiance's 30th bday last year with a group of about 20 peeps. Despite having a bit of a verbal scuffle with one of our servers (see below), I'm still giving it 5 stars. The food is THAT good. I had the petite filet mignon, butter filled with garlic and it was cooked perfectly....it melted in my mouth. No joke. While most of us had steaks, my pesceterian pal had some sort of salmon and said it was equally excellent. We all shared the garlic mashed potatoes, au gratin potatoes, fresh broccoli in a cheese sauce & asparagus in hollandaise for our sides. I'd HIGHLY recommend any of these! Fyi,  all of their sides are family style so unless you're a BIG eater, I recommend sharing. This place is not cheap (average $40 a person...excluding cocktails!) but it's sooooo worth it.

**The rest of their staff was friendly & efficient. It was just one A-hole who had a problem with serving a large crowd--we ended up getting another server and he was awesome."}
{"text":"This review covers a higher end steakhouse and how it compares to others in the same class. To add some weight to this review  a short list of some similar restaurants I've dinned- Oceanaire The Seadfood Room Minneapolis, Salty's on the Columbia in Portland Oregon, Charlies Steakhouse Orlando, Mortons - multiple cities, Manny's Steakhouse Minneapolis, The Capitol Grille - multiples cities and the list goes on... This was my first visit to Ruth Cris... 

I was greeted at the door with some friendly faces and welcoming conversation. We had a reservation and they seated us quickly in a booth which we requested.

We were greeted at the table promptly. I was ordered a Coke along with the rest of the table while looking at the wine list. Three people were given their drinks and I was left with nothing. After driving for several hours I really felt like a drink and the water I was given was already gone. Several minutes later I finally got to request my Coke again. It took a while and finally my coke arrived. I'll cover this now but refills were very slow. 

We ordered a small seafood tower and asked for a salad to come out at the same time for someone who wasn't eating seafood. The seafood tower came out but no salad for several minute. We asked where the salad was and we were told it was coming. Now for the seafood tower....I have eaten at a lot of higher end restaurants similar in the class of Ruth Cris and this seafood tower was tasteless. I've had at least 1,2,3+ seafood towers at all of the restaurants I listed earlier and this and this seafood tower came in dead last by far! It may have been worth the $59 if it tasted awesome but I wouldn't have paid $10 for it at Costco. 

The main course I had were lamb chops which were cooked to order. They were a little fatty on some portions. Some of the lamb was just ok and other parts had some great flavour. That being said I have had much better lamb chops (Romanza Restaurant - Pepper Mill Casino Reno) for less, $39. 

We had some potato wedges/skins of some sort as a side and they did taste nice. We also had asparagus. I can cook it perfectly at home so it tastes amazing. This was well hard on the roots end and spongy and soggy at the tips. It was very stringy in the middle. We could not eat it by just chewing it. Each piece had to be chopped up so you could chew it a little and swallow it.  

Dessert was very nice but very small. I had the small chocolate molten cake which came with a side of whipped cream on top of some chocolate moose. Honestly, I should have just skipped all of dinner and had dessert as it was by far the nicest thing I had on the menu during my experience. 

Of all the times I've dinned at higher end steakhouses I had never been to Ruth Cris. I'm not sure I would even come back. It was a less than average experience. 

If you're looking for the BEST place in Madison to dine at in the way of steak, wine with some seafood Johnny Delmonico's wins hands down. I wouldn't even think about coming to this restaurant. My humble honest opinion."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for a week's vacation and decided to go to Ruth Chris on a whim on Saturday around 5:30pm to walk in and they said that we'd have to wait 1-2 hours for a table and we could get food service in the bar so we did.  Had a cold beverage that was COLD and hit the spot!  Then my wife ordered the Chopped Salad and I ordered the Calamari.  The salad was great, the calamari had some Asian chili and sweet blend that was just OK?  I guess I was expecting a more traditional calamari.  The bread was OK, little to crusty form my taste,  for you bread aficionados!  I had a 16 oz ribeye, medium rare, and she ordered a petite fillet and we shared the sweet potato casserole and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.  I'm a big eater and the steak was perfect and way more than I should have ordered.  Great flavoring.  The petite fillet was perfect and my wife said it was the best she ever had and she has had many!  The sweet potato casserole was to  die for...it would have been a great dessert with some vanilla ice cream!!!  The bar ambiance was OK, couple of TVs so we got our sports fix, and an apparently active hot spot though I will get reservation next time.  The service was excellent, attentive, timely, and a tall gentleman that I assumed was the manager stopped by the table to see how we enjoyed our meal.  Overall it was a little pricey but is a great splurge.  What would have made this a 5 star instead of 4?  I would not have gotten the calamari and more yummy bread.  I like Ruth Chris so I would likely go back... and make a reservation!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a great meal.    Chopped Salad, Filet, Baked Potato, Dessert! Awesome meal!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Ruth's Chris this past Saturday  night. Since it was last minute the earliest reservation was at 9:30 pm. Getting there was horrible,as the area is pretty contested  so give yourself plenty of time.
We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. My husband and I both tried one of the Restaraunt Week specials, as well as some appetizers and a bottle of wine. The service was pretty good and the food came out in a timely matter. The steaks were very good but the sides were....just ok. Rather plain and even a little cold. We may try again at another time, but this trip was not really what we were hoping for."}
{"text":"Winterlicious & VDay = Ruth's Chris

Best choice ever to celebrate an early vday with the boyfriend. It was one of the best experiences we've had in a while. The atmosphere was really elegant and beautiful. For my starter, I had the Lobster Bisque, there was little bites of lobster floating around, however I was not a fan of the flavor. My 6oz medium rare steak filet was on a sizzling hot plate with butter. The steak juts melted in my mouth and it hands down the best tasting steak I have ever had. Cheesecake is by far my favorite dessert ever and the crust was sooooo good. It definitely cured my craving for sweets. 

Overall this was the best experience I've had in a really long time. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This saddens me to post....

I remember being a kid and loving this place.  Now I'm all grown up, and I recognize that a place who puts soda water in an old fashioned should not be frequented.

And this place looks like it's in an old Sheraton lobby...  


BUT!!!!  Their happy hour menu is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"It bugs me when i know what i want to order and they start telling me a 5 minute story of what state the fish came from, how it was caught, how they prepare it, how their experienced chefs cook it, and so on.... 

Service was horrible....entered with a buddy of mine and they made him go back to his car to put on a long sleeve or jacket.  Host had PMS for sure.  Food was undercooked and displayed very sloppy.  No one looks when you need service but when you wanna be left alone, some waiter comes out to ask you how your food was, etc.  Bread sent out was stale...."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour, very good, got the steak skewers salad and shrimp appitzers, steak was a little tough for Tenderloin, the Shrimp Appetizer was very good and the Ruth Manhattan was excellent"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was average. Price was exuberant... waiters were top notch but the restaurant is due for a facelift. The chef also had issues with cooking times. Both me and the mrs ordered medium but mine was perfectly pink and hers was well done. 

Our top notch waiter insisted on bringing her a new one but in classic style the next one came out blood red. 

I'd go back... but she wouldn't. :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Ruth's Chris restaurant I've visited. The steaks here are always well flavored and super tender. Customer service is also a huge plus"}
{"text":"Food was horrible staff was confused and it was the worst experience I've ever had at a steak restaurant. Me and my wife's steaks where cooked wrong after waiting an hour for it. Then the steaks they recooked had nothing but fat on each bite a (Ribeye)? The only thing that was good was the salad and sides. We came to celebrate our anniversary and was VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"When we got there, it was really packed. Since we were two of us, we got seated within a few minutes which was nice. We ordered Cesar salad, Lobster mac & cheese and Cowboy Ribeye. Steak was cooked to perfection. Everything was delicious. Attentive service and great food. Our server, Jessica was awesome she checked on us occasionally. I would definitely be back.(:"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked steaks and delightful servers. The atmosphere here is something to be desired in more establishments."}
{"text":"I made the perfect choice where to spend my birthday and anniversary. Yes, the same day! 
My family came in and we had great food, great service and an entire welcoming staff. 

Jeff, our waiter was outstanding! The General Manager even stopped by for a table visit. The food was delicious. Out entire party loved their dinners= no boxes going home. The sides were great and the flourless chocolate cake is a must. Thanks Ruth Chris for a fab evening of dining!"}
{"text":"We were craving steak so I did a search for steak and came across this amazing place. I ordered the lobster bisque, ribeye medium, and creamed spinach for dinner. For wine, we had the pinot noir. The service, food, and the wine were all impeccable. I will be returning here... whether I am home or back in vegas!"}
{"text":"i was looking for a really good dinner so I decided that I was going to have steak I looked up steak houses in Charlotte so I decided that I would go and give it a try. i walked into the bar at 8 p.m. I ordered a black and blue salad with steak. the steak melted in my mouth I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for the best steakhouse in town I would give this place 10 start if I could"}
{"text":"The only things not to like about this Ruth's Chris are that you have to walk into the Harrah's casino. The stale cigarette smell stays with you a little bit as you get off the elevator on the second floor.

I decided to sit in the bar area and had a commanding view of the strip. Things took awhile to get going, but once my server arrived, things went well.

I enjoyed the chowder, a fillet and decided to try something new. I ordered a side of onion rings. They were amazing, to both look at and eat. They were huge.

Expensive? Yes, but worth it. I had skipped both breakfast and lunch so I think I deserved it."}
{"text":"Delicious, savory food. The steak is cooked to perfection. The side dishes are made in heaven."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our 5 year Wedding Anniversary 8/5/2015. This Ruth's Chris is located inside Harrah's Resort & Casino. We had an 8pm reservation and when we arrived we were seated right away. The service was excellent and our waitress was a doll. The atmosphere here is very romantic. I would suggest making a reservation to avoid waiting a long time. The food was fantastic!! I started my meal with the crab cake appetizer and let me tell you baby that crab cake was all crab. The best crab cake I've had in a long time. We both had the Rib eye with grilled asparagus, loaded bake potato & onion rings all to share. The portions are huge here so you can share all sides if you want. We also had a complimentary bottle of wine which completed this magnificent meal. At the end of our meal we were given two delicious desserts with Happy Anniversary written on it. It was a beautiful experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for steak. We will for sure be returning here on our next trip back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food as always was delicious and the service was excellent we were celebrating our 36 anniversary we got a delicious cheese cake on the house.  I was surprised that the waiter did not take a photo they normally take a photo when you are celebrating something anyways other then that all was great."}
{"text":"As you would expect from Ruths service and food outstanding . They even made us a drink thats not on the menu that we had at a Ruths in Birmingham. Spot on!  My lamb chops perfectly cooked as my husbands bone in filet. The fingering chipotle potatoes were good and just spicy enough."}
{"text":"Last year, I was conveniently staying in Harrah's.  My honey and I had dinner here for my birthday.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The steaks are what we came here for and cooked to perfection.  Our waiter was kind and very attentive.

We had coffee and dessert, and how beautifully they decorated my dessert plate.  I am so happy we came here."}
{"text":"The rib eye was a five star, expensive but five star. Having said that Ruth's Chirs missed the mark in virtually every other department.

First of all the setting has no character, no charm. It's just a sparsely decorated uninviting room. Most importantly from the minute we walked in the service was juvenile and bordering on unprofessional. If we had been asked how thing were by one more person who clearly did care in any way we would have walked out.

I don't blame the severs at all, I blame the owners."}
{"text":"Horrible, we sat in a booth for my wife's bday celebration and the manager came by and said, \"thanks for bringing your daughter in for her bday!\"   My wife is 21 years younger than me.  Insulting !! The steak was full of  fat, I complained and the result was the bald headed manager upgraded the dessert from the dessert already included in the Classic meal.  Manager was terrible...   BAD EXPERIENCE!!!  
Ismael was an excellent waiter!!!"}
{"text":"Service here is horrible. Coming to a high end restaurant, you're expecting to receive good service but not here. The server who brings the food pretty much drops it on the table... 

For appetizers, ordered the ahi tuna. The ahi tuna was slightly torched placed on top of sauce. I think the tuna was rolled in Cajun powder. The sauce tasted like wasabi. It was really stronger and overpowered the taste of the tuna. They should've put the sauce on the side instead. We did not end up finishing the dish because we didn't like the flavour. 

Also ordered the lobster bisque. This soup was pretty good. Creamy and flavour full 

For main we ordered the ribeye steak and the cowboy steak. Both these dishes were cooked well to the level we wanted. But the steaks are drenched in a lot of butter. It was so oily and fattening that you would not be able to finish it because it's just too much. The presentation of the steaks were so ugly... like whaaaaaaaaaaat. Presentation is an important feature of making food look appetizing but nope not here. You pretty much had just a steak on a plate of butter. The plate barely fit the steak. It was hanging off. Like ... how am I supposed to cut this properly. 

Their strawberry slushy was good but not worth the price. You can probably get the same thing else where for cheaper. 

For the birthday person they got a complimentary dessert  ! But it was pretty much a two bit brownie that you can get at the convenience store, topped with whipped cream and a few fruits. Disappointing.

Overall: not worth the price. Horrible service. Super oily steaks. Ugly presentation. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris, been to several and always good. Was a little disappointed with the Vegas version. We had to wait to be seated, despite having a reservation. While I understand some of that may be out of there control, it's a pet peeve of mine, if I have a 7 PM rez I want to be seated close to 7. Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the ribeye with frenchfries and sweet potato casserole. I know, I know, 2 starches but my wife love the casserole and I wanted fries Don't judge. We also ordered green beans, or hericot verts, happy?  Food came and fries were not cooked. Raw in the middle, so we sent them back and they came back... burnt. No visit from manager, and we ate the crispy fries. You can't make a French fry? For 99 cents I can get delicious fries a high school kid cooked at Mickey Ds and get $11 fries? Not so much. Steak was cooked perfectly. Wife had filet and it was also cooked perfectly. Casserole was awesome. Green beans were crisp. Love RC but this one? Meh"}
{"text":"Ruths Chris is really just another chain. 
It really varies between countries. I find the Toronto location is ok. The portions of the sides are no way close to some other countries.

They're not the greatest at cooking steaks over medium. This to me is a true test of a good steak house. One of my guests had a medium well steak, and it was clearly cooked using a press on the grill - in essence burnt and with no consideration.

Taste wise, the cajun on the shrimps isn't very pleasant. The wild mushroom side did stand out from everything had that night. Excellent."}
{"text":"So I ate here a few nights ago while visiting Vegas and was not disappointed, but I was upset with a few things. I will start by saying that the petite filet was delicious, and it was perfectly done. I paired it with the cheaper Sterling Merlot. I also had a side of sweet potato casserole, since I can never pass up anything with sweet potatoes. 

Here is where I was disappointed:

First, the service was OK. Don't get me wrong, our server and her \"helper\" or assistant, whatever you choose to call it, were very friendly and attentive. However, they were improper. I also work at a high end restaraunt where service is very important. Language at the table can make all the difference in the world. For example, rather than attending to individuals there was yelling across the table and the whole \"what can I get for ya?\" type of service. 

Second, the presentation was absolutely terrible. They serve their steak on a plate by itself bc their plates are 500 degrees when they come out. So your side will actually be on the side, which is fine, but none of it had any type of garnish, and you could tell the rims had not been wiped down after the food was plated.

These may not be that big of a deal to many people but it should be noted, because when you are paying for a high end restaraunt you should be receiving top quality in all areas of the restaraunt, not just the food. I say this because part of the price you pay should reflect your experience in this type of place rather than only the food. 

I don't mean to be rude, I am sure being in the Vegas location the turnover is much higher and they probably don't have time to be as attentive as they might be somewhere else. But if you are like me and and believe these are important factors in your dining experience, then keep walking. I am sure there are other high end Vegas restaraunts where you can receive the whole package for that price at Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Oh, Ruth's Chris.  You were so good at the Yelp Elite event when you first opened at the Harrah's.  What happened?? 

At the request of my mom (she was my plus one at the Elite event and was very impressed), we celebrated my brother's birthday at Ruth's Chris a couple of weeks ago.  Please be forewarned that there is no valet or self parking anywhere near Ruth's Chris.  It's at the exact opposite of all the entrances if you are arriving by car.  

The one star is for the decoration of the restaurant, but that was it.  From the bread, the 400 degree hot plate of bone-in ribeye, to our server's unkempt attire, it was not the \"upscale\" experience, food or service, Ruth's Chris is supposed to be.  

By no mean am I trying to be a snob about the whole affair.  I think I am capable of adjusting my standards based on where I am at.  However, for the price and the service, I'd take my dollar right next door to the Caesar's Palace Joe's Stonecrab and be a happier customer."}
{"text":"It's Ruth Chris, what did you expect?  Food is always perfect.  Service always top notch.  My only hesitation about giving it 5 stars is the atmosphere and the building itself.  This Ruth Chris location feels a little more like being in a Cheesecake Factory rather than a classic steak joint, but that won't stop me from going back again and again."}
{"text":"Please allow me to pull the wool from over your eyes so you can see that Ruth's Chris is just a regular steak house. Yes, the menu is a la carte (a.k.a. pricey, a.k.a. expensive, a.k.a. overpriced). Yes, the service is impeccable. Yes, they have a great patio. 

BUT...the food is average. And when I say average, I'm talking about the kind of average a teacher will stick a + on just to make the parent think their kid ain't so bad.

You can find the same menu at less expensive places and probably have more room at your table.

For you vegetarians who find yourselves eating at RC with the carniv's, don't bother getting the vegetarian plate (market price). You'll only make yourself angry. I suggest you spend dollars on a baked potato side ($10), then convince one of the carniv's that they need some veggies with their cut of carcass. You know they won't finish all, so you can swoop in to help them out.

The best plate was the dessert. It's worth the sawbuck I paid. As far as the meal, I relied on filling up with table bread and completely underwhelming, tasteless, oily veggies.

Unfortunately I didn't try a salad, but from what I could see at other tables, they looked all right."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and each time I've had the exact same issue - cold food and horrific service. Not worth that $150 whatsoever. I regret even wasting my time and money the second time."}
{"text":"The service was great- perhaps a touch too attentive with too many \"is everything ok\" stops. But no complaints. The wait staff were friendly. 

The atmosphere was nice. The wine list sufficient, but unimpressive. 

The food? Well, it was only \"ok\". The dinner was good, and nowhere near bad, but it wasn't a $60 steak either. The potatoes au gratin were cheesy blandness and the asparagus stalks were fibrous and tough.  As a local there are many fantastic steakhouses in Vegas that will knock your socks off. Some are more expensive than here, some less. The point is the food here is less than average when compared to its peers. 

I wouldn't fault anyone for going to Ruth Chris', but I wouldn't recommend it either."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, amazing food the seafood platter was fresh and delicious! We were there on Christmas Day. I could go on and on. You get the picture."}
{"text":"Perfection.

You know when you're flying, in an airplane, and you're thumbing thru the airlines magazine and you come across the ad w/ the picture of the perfect filet mignon?  That's Ruth Christ Steakhouse.

Our family has been looking for the perfect filet mignon and found it about 10 years ago here, at Ruth Chris.  So we've been coming here annually for my dad's birthday, also Christmas Eve, ever since.

Perfect meal includes, Appetizer: BBQ shrimp, in a buttery white wine, semi-spicy sauce that will have you licking the plate, or at least asking for more bread to help you look a little more dignified. Salad: Wedge, with perfect crispness iceberg lettuce and a chunky blue cheese. Soup: Lobster Bisque, buttery goodness.  Meal: Filet Mignon medium. Sides: Mashed potatoes perfectly whipped and topped with butter and if it's the holiday time the sweet potatoes casserole is so tempting.  Desert: Crème Brule comes with berries and is the perfect consistency once broken thru hard candied layer.

Now, I will not eat all of that.  I've had all of these, and more, but will only be able to go thru a portion of what's above.  My eyes are way bigger than my stomach at this place.  It's come to where I won't even open the menu as I'm afraid I will drift away from what I usually get and order too much.

This is a long review for me, I'm usually to the point, but there is so much to share about this place.  Mainly the food but not to go unmentioned: the service, spectacular, the wine list, pricey but a wonderful selection and the ambiance, upscale without being too froufrou.

I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Yumm! I've never had a steak like this. I don't claim to be a connoisseur, but the meat was delicious! We had the porterhouse for 2 (med) for $89 and a side of au gratin potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. The sides were enough to share between my husband and I.  We also had a side of the shrimp. We were full, and very satisfied. We loved our patio seating. It was just perfect. The server was about an 8/10. But the food made up for it! Our total bill was about $125 and we were expecting about $200, so we were ok with the final price. Would we go again? Absolutely."}
{"text":"First place I went to for winterlicious 2015 and I have to say it was amazing. Although when you look at the deal you get with winterlicious you are only really saving 9 dollars since they have the Ruth's classic already on the menu priced at $54 compared to winterlicious at $45. But this is besides the point, if your coming to this restaurant I assume price is not an issue for you.

Starter: Lobster Bisque: Wasn't sure if there was any lobster in my bisque, but it was flavorful. I found the bisque to be a little salty as did my friends. Overall I would not recommend this as your starter. It didn't taste like a freshly made soup, more of a premade soup, but what do I know.

Entree: 6oz Steak Filet - Amazing, I got my steak cooked medium-rare which I only get at higher end restaurants since I don't trust anyone else and it came out perfect. The hot plate with butter took the steak up a notch and it was by far one of my best steak experiences I've had in Toronto. Can't go wrong with getting steak at a steak house so I'll move on.

Dessert: Cheesecake - By far the best winterlicious option. Our table ordered one of everything and I was not a fan of the coffee/toffee cake nor the apple dessert. The cheesecake tasted like something from the cheesecake factory.

By the end of our meal however I was stuffed. The entire course is very large and I don't recommend finishing the entire course however I did but regretted that decision after leaving the restaurant.

Overall, great place you can't go wrong with Ruth Chris if your looking for a solid steak!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times over the years and never fail to have a memorable experience.  I love Ruth's Chris and I'll keep coming back for the consistently mouth watering steaks, excellent service, and fantastic wine."}
{"text":"The good: tasty Brussels sprouts, lovely cowboy ribeye, and a truly exquisite bone-in New York Strip.

The bad: all things considered, the service was lacking, both in terms of promptness and as a source of advice throughout the food-selection and wine-pairing process.

The ugly: the thick black hairs we found in the au gratin potatoes.

Overall verdict: while the service disappointed and the restaurant could have done more from a cleanliness perspective, the food more than made up for these disappointing aspects of our visit.

We came to Ruth's Chris on a Friday night. We'd made a reservation some time before and we're quickly seated. The waiter greeted and offered us a choice of water promptly; the water came shortly thereafter. I cannot say the same about the wine. I asked for a sample of wine; after about 15 minutes, nothing had happened. I asked the water for the sample--yet again, nothing. On my third try, I finally got my wine--after a 20-minute or so wait.

I also found the ordering process to be disappointing. The waiter seemed to lack firm opinions on any aspect of the menu other than dessert; there's nothing I find more disappointing at this stage in the dining process than a yes-man, so to speak.

We ultimately settled in the bone-in cowboy ribeye (medium rare plus) and bone-in New York strip (medium). We also accepted a recommendation from the waiter (I've got to hand it to him--this was a good call) to have both steaks seared for a few seconds--doing so really augmented the rich taste of the marbling in both steaks.

The ribeye was good, but the strip was truly a blast. With the ribeye, I found much of the flavor to center around the marbling. I guess that, in and of itself, is not unusual. With the strip, however, I found that both meat and marbling were bursting with juicy flavor. I've also sworn by ribeye, but I'm definitely going for the strip the next time I come by here.

We ordered the Brussels sprouts and au gratin potatoes as sides. The former were quite good if slightly greasy; I would, nonetheless, recommend them. The latter was extraordinarily cheesy, although the potatoes were surprisingly flavorful. We only got to try one of the potatoes before we found several large hairs inside the dish--at least they took this order off of our bill.

We didn't order dessert, although the waiter very strongly recommended the bread pudding (again, something to try at a later date.

All in all, I found the waiter to not be particularly attentive. He was kind enough to take a few pictures of us, which somewhat ameliorated my impression of him, but I'd say I saw him six or seven times over the course of more than two hours. Despite this, the meal was wonderful and is enough of a draw in its own right to bring me back."}
{"text":"Love Ruth's Chris... always consistently great. Did a wine dinner and it was my first here. I've done many wine dinners... and this was by far one of the best. 
From making the reservation.... to the follow up phone calls and confirmation email/phone call. 
So professional. 
Food and Wine pairings were amazing. For $99 a person... it's a true value. I like the small room that we were in and also the tables of 6/7.... just enough for great conversation! 
I'll be back for many more of the wine dinners. 
If you haven't ever been to one... this is a great place to start!!"}
{"text":"By far the very best steak I have ever had
Great hostess when I checked in and service was great"}
{"text":"Awesome like always.  Good food. Great staff.  My go to spot in Vegas when I am in town and need to take a customer out to a nice restaurant"}
{"text":"Start with the good stuff. The server was really attentive, and had a very good sense of humor (which I really appreciate at a restaurant). Our orders arrived remarkably quickly. The food was yummy. We started with the Caesar salad which was tasty.  We each had filet mignon (both cooked to perfection). We had sides of Lyonnaise potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. The hollandaise sauce actually was very good.  We did not get dessert.

Now why I didn't give more than 3 stars: 

(a) when I made our reservation on Opentable.com, I couldn't get anything earlier than 8:00 p.m. (They open at 5:00pm. I wanted 7:00 or 7:30pm). When we arrived, however, the place was over 2/3 empty (it was the night of the Grammys); 

(b) my \"petit\" filet mignon cost $42, my friend's regular filet (which wasn't any larger than mine) was $55. All we got was the steaks. No sides. Not even some kind of sauce other than ketchup or A1 (Flemings at least offers a selection of Au Juice, etc.).  They said the sides we ordered were big enough to share. They were not even close. The portion barely reached the top of each small serving dish. For the prices they were charging it should have been overflowing.  In short, we got more food, for (literally) about 1/4 the price at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian;

(c) I have been to several Ruth's Chris steakhouses. Each of them has a very similar feel of a  high-end, classy steak house (big private booths, warm wood colors, etc).  This location clearly had been cheaply jerry-rigged out of a prior restaurant. While it looked nice enough, perhaps, to be a \"Ruby Tuesday's\" location, it looked nothing like what you would expect from a Ruth's Chris; and 

(d) To get to the restaurant you needed to park in a lot that was, at best, sketchy and nasty, and then walk through a hotel (Harrah's) that is (or should be) two days away from a wrecking ball and a week-long environmental decontamination project.  Although there certainly should have been, sadly there was not one of those hand sanitizer dispensers outside the elevators to the restaurant"}
{"text":"service is spectacular here. and the food is delicious. i had the petite filet and they cooked it perfectly medium rare. i had the mashed potatoes and it was more than enough. you could probably share one between two or three people. its pricey. but well worth it. very quiet atmosphere. the only thing that was a problem was parking but i guess that shows how popular this place is."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not great, and for the price there are far better options in the Madison area.

My steak was cooked perfectly, but I ordered it Oscar style and the crab meat wasn't that good. We also had the crab stuffed mushrooms and same thing, so I'd stay away from anything with crab in it. The brussel sprouts were a pretty good side.

Again, I'm not saying this place is bad, but it's only slightly above average and yet very expensive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I split the Porterhouse steak for two and it was probably one of the best steaks either of us have ever had. Great atmosphere, delicious food and amazing wine list. I would highly recommend dinner at Ruth's if staying on the Vegas strip!!"}
{"text":"First timer at Ruth's. We had an amazing experience celebrating our anniversary. We both had the fillet medium rare. It comes pretty rare but on a 500 degree plate it finishes cooking quickly. 2 sides were also excellent. Green chili Mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes. Staff was exceptional and made us feel welcome. Atmosphere is fancy yet comfortable."}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me to write. I have been  to this Ruth's Chris a half a dozen times and have eaten at the New Orleans, Miami, Beverly Hills, san Diego, and Irvine locations. I've always counted on Ruth's Chris and until thanksgiving had NEVER been disappointed.
 My wife and I took my Mom for Thanksgiving dinner and the Servers rushed us to order, when we did order the food came in less than 4 min.
 We were asked if we wanted bread, and then if we wanted the \" regular \" bread or the better bread for an extra charge. How cheesy is that?
 My steak was not served on a sizzling plate as usual, my wife's turkey was cold...come on, this is Ruth's Chris!
  Now, instead of always going to a Ruth's Chris for a special dinner we will try other places. I guess the old saying is true..you're only as good as your last meal."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing experience. Steaks were obviously amazing but the service was simply the best I have ever had in any steakhouse throughout the country."}
{"text":"The thing I enjoy most about Ruth's is the consistency from Florida to Carolina. 
This downtown Charlotte location is a must visit. The wait staff from the minute we walked in to the moment we left was over the top. Our servers knowledge on wine alone was remarkable, his descriptions on our bottle of Faust made my mouth water even before the bottle hit the table. The manager Greg even made us feel special by bringing us a complimentary dessert just to thank us for coming in. 
We will be back again to sit out on the patio very soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible host, they don't honor reservations and are snobby.... Take your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Jonathan is the best!!!! This is my favorite steak house hands down. The service given by Jonathan and his counterpart always brings the experience to the next level. There has never been a time that he has not out done the last visit- he always pays attention to the details and makes sure the food is on point- amazing amazing amazing!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is an old-time steak house in almost every respect, and I don't think it has kept up with the times.  Basically, it is expensive and does not deliver the value we expect today.

The main shortcoming is the food.  There is nothing wrong with it exactly, except an apparent belief that seasonings are evil.  But there is not enough right.  To be sure, the portions are large and the ingredients fresh and of good quality.  But for the prices they charge you expect more than a steak broiled in butter or a salad with greens and radish slices and little else.  You expect imagination, innovation, bold flavors, attractive presentation -- in short, a little pizazz.  There is no pizazz here.  

Now if all you want is a plain steak, ordinary creamed spinach, simple potatoes, and a common salad, Ruth's Chris is your place.  Otherwise you will enjoy the meal but hate the check."}
{"text":"Won't return. Far too expensive for what you get. We have eaten at some of the best and gotten far better food for this price. Even in Maui. Smothered in butter. Nothing at all special about the potatoes. No presentation just food slapped on the plate. They messed up our order and the potatoes were cold. Overcharged us a little and didn't offer to comp the mix up or cold food until we asked. Server was nice.they comped our wine and it was still outrageous $$$$."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Ruth's Chris a few weeks ago with friends and family. We first stopped by the bar for a cocktail before sitting down for dinner. The bar tender was very nice and took great care of our large group. My glass of Pino Noir was fabulous, thank you for the recommendation! 

The great service continued once we sat down for dinner. I am sure it had nothing to do with the fact that there were 10 of us and we were for sure going to rack up a hefty tab and they saw a huge tip out of us. ;-) They were great none the less. More wine all around the table! The appetizers were good, stuffed mushrooms, sauteed shrimp and something else, not super memorable, but all tasted good from what I remember. 

On to the steak!! I ordered the filet with blue cheese crumbles on top, very tasty. However, not the best steak I have ever had. I would order it again though. Everything around the table looked, smelled and tasted good, but same with my steak, I have had better elsewhere. Not sure how that Lobster was though... as the crazy girl with Anthony at the table wouldn't share...Psh! Beotch! lol @Georgeann G. 

I will say, dessert was the best and everyone's favorite part. Awesome Tony took note at all the women he had sitting at the table and made sure to order plenty.... two of everything he says. :-) The chocolate cake was amazing, the creme brule was perfection, but the cheese cake was my favorite! Yum! 

Ruth's is a great place for dinner, I could recommend a better steak in town, but you still really can't go wrong here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Talk about the perfect meal and experience!  It was my birthday so they placed little happy birthday confetti on the table to so everyone who approached knew we were celebrating something.  

Service was impeccable, from the hostess to the server.  Everyone did a great job.  It probably helped that it wasn't that busy, but we'll take it regardless.

Food was excellent. I'm not a steak person so I opted for the stuffed chicken.  My dinner partner had the T-Bone steak though and said it was great.  

For my birthday, they delivered a little cheesecake which was just the right size for a nice dessert.  

Note: If your Diamond level with Total Rewards (which we are thanks to the matching Tier levels from other casino's), you get a $100 dinner celebration which we were able to apply to this meal.  Still expect to pay about $75 per person and remember to tip based on the full price and not the remaining balance."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to Ruth's Chris Steak House the food was prepared perfect and was hot when delivered to the table. I would recommend it to anyone. Keep up the good job....."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever had! (And I've lived in Nebraska) 

-beautiful atmosphere with superb service
-melt in your mouth steaks! I always accompany my meat with sauce, but in this case the sauce would have ruined the flavor. They were delicious. 
-for sides we enjoyed fries, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. They were all fantastic! 
-don't skip the bread and butter either; very good. 

It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"We ate here Sunday during the Queens Feast in Charlotte. As with every visit to Ruths Chris the service outshines the perfectly cooked & delicious meal. We enjoyed Alex our server & all his fellow coworkers attention to our needs the way you expect at any of these locations. My steak was perfect in preperation, presentation & flavor. Mushroom souip was superb, garlic mashed potatoes; need I even go there? Perfect. They let us add a couple lobster tails to my Queens Feast selection for my wife to enjoy. VERY Nice! Alex thank you again! Thanks for a great night and meal!  

PS: The shoestring french fries with Bernaise on the side is divine!"}
{"text":"Omg first time coming here with my boyfriend a few days ago for dinner. We've been to a few steakhouses before but this one is by far our favorite so far! Emily, our server was very very nice and very informational. She was prompt with our orders and the food was ah-may-zing! We definitely will come back for special occasions. Thanks for a great first experience, Emily!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday and it was wonderful.  Wanted to have a nice date night and that's exactly what it was.  We had Felipe for a server and it was great.  Started with the Black Cherry-Tini and he started with a Screwdriver.  Both were excellent and portions were great.  Started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and they were amazing, I finished two before he even finished one! I moved onto the Pomegranate Martini and again it was great.  I had the Caribbean Lobster Tail and he had the Petite Filet and Crab Legs.  We shared a side of mashed potatoes and everything was really well done.  We skipped dessert in order to make a late movie, but next time we won't - too many things looked delicious. We really enjoyed the experience and it was quiet, cozy and warm being right next to the fireplace.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this really has some delicious food.  I've eaten at many restaurants and I had lamb several times but the lamb chops were unspeakably perfect! I liked them so much we came back and racked up another 300 dollar bill in less than 4 days. The service was great our first time but not so great the second time but the food was on point both times. The ambiance was perfect for a night out."}
{"text":"We've eaten at other Ruth's Chris restaurants over the years and they never disappoint. The bill will be high but you know that walking in. All of the things we were looking for, good table great food and good service tied in. Tried to get our waiter taking our group picture while we had the meals in front of us and he was too busy. It was a Friday night so I'll cut him some slack. He DID take a great picture but all the plates were empty. Not a deal breaker. Spent over 3 hours there with friends I hadn't seen in years and there was no attempt for us to empty the table. A great evening."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with date. Won't be seeing this date again but i will be returning to this steak house! 
I'm extremely picky about my filets, usually prefer my own to those in restaurants. My filet here was so tender it nearly melted in my mouth. Cooked perfectly at MR and delivered on a sizzling hot plate 
The sides were good, salad good, but let's face it its all about the steak right? Best side is the sweet potato casserole.  Chocolate sin cake with espresso was fantastic
Service was great, attentive without hovering."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday end of March. We have been here before but this was the first time we celebrated a birthday here. He made reservations and when we were brought to the table they have Happy Birthday confetti every where. Such a nice little touch. The service as always is excellent and so is the food. It was my first time having a cocktail there and I must say it's worth the money. I had the raspberry rosemary cosmo. It was delicious! After two I was set. This place is a must try for those who haven't already been here."}
{"text":"If you are going to charge what a good chain steakhouse does, justify it. Unfortunately, Ruth is not even in the same hemisphere of the likes of Capital Grill, Vic and Anthony's and Mastros. Food is average and service is subpar. Spend your money and calories elsewhere folks."}
{"text":"One of my all time restaurants is back in the land!! Finally!! They did not disappoint either! Great times great food."}
{"text":"My sister and I go to Ruth's Chris every restaurant week- winter and summer!  We have never been disappointed with the food or service.
We typically get the same thing every time we go, and share the sides- we have tried both the Filet and Crab Cakes- and would recommend both.
They have a great wine selection and can offer great recommendations based on what you order.
The dessert is amazing! They always have something great, but we ALWAYS get the Berries and Creme- I highly suggest trying it.
This past time Steve was our waiter and he was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place numerous times over the years and most recently last night. They've done a bit of remodeling and raised the prices, but I'm afraid the quality has gone down. Where's the quality control? They got my steak wrong twice - very wrong in fact. We both asked for the Fillet cooked Medium to Medium-well... we got one fillet cooked properly, and in front of me was a tiny little overcooked dry hunk of meat. They gave me the petite and cooked it beyond well done. 

Since we had already filled up on bread and whatnot while waiting for our steaks, we just decided to split the correct steak. They took the other one away and gave me a sizzling hot empty plate. They also offered to make a new steak for us to take home for free to make up for it. We almost turned it down, but figured since we had half the bottle of wine to get through it might be done by the time we were ready to leave. They brought out a new one less than 2 minutes later. He said 'luckily we had one back there for you.' I'd suspect it to be my original order, but too much time had passed for it to be that. Plus, this one was undercooked - pretty much rare. We didn't want to say anything since it was free and we felt like complainers at this point. 

The service was pretty shitty at first - for the first hour actually. We were ignored and forgotten. We weren't dressed like homeless people or anything either. When we weren't being ignored, we were having our order screwed up. Then they spent the rest of the night trying to make up for it. It's as though they just expect to suck and then when customers get mad about it, they kiss ass. Maybe it's a new rich people fad I don't know about. Going out somewhere to pay a lot and get crap service so you can have a reason to complain to someone and have someone suck up to you. 

Hell, if it isn't a fad, I want to make it one. Maybe I'll open a store that sells expensive crap - then when they try to buy it, I'll be rude and mean to them until they are about to give up - then I'll just let them take the stuff home for free and smooch their butts until they feel good about themselves. But I digress...

It took forever to get our food ordered, then forever again to get it delivered. We sat at the bar because they were too busy to seat us. It was funny watching the two bartenders run around like they were working a packed night club when there were actually only about 5 people seated at the bar including us.

I think I've been let down by this place as many times as I've been pleased. And I keep going back because of the shrimp and the sizzling steak plates and the one or two really amazing steaks I've eaten there... truth is though, I cook a much better steak at home - hell, I could buy a new barbecue, gas tank, a novelty apron, tongs, 5 bottles of wine, an oven mitt, and 10 steaks for the same price as going to this place 5 times (with someone and paying for us both)... 

I still think it's a decent steakhouse - pretty much overpriced - but good. I prefer this place to the other expensive steak chains, but there's some new ones that I haven't been to yet. Perhaps Ruth's Chris's era is coming to an end...

Another thing worth noting - half the people there had silver hair and the other half only had half their hair. There was a hanging portrait of some old lady dressed in red - probably Ruth (or Chris?) - that we had to stare at while we ate. Some actual old lady wearing red stopped near the picture to grab some mints and wait for her slow-ass husband. We were very amused at the likeness."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had heard many positive things about their steaks and finally got a chance to check it out during a birthday and anniversary celebration. The whipped butter on warm bread rolls are divine and the scallops (while pricey at $20 for 4) was very succulent. The fillet had more flavour than the rib eye but both were cooked to perfection and the mashed potato side is quite large (good enough for three people). 

The place is very baby friendly (there is no change table in the bathroom but there is a nook in the ladies bathroom where I was able to quick do a diaper change at) and the on a Friday evening there were quite a few families out. 

As we were celebrating (and had mentioned it on our reservation through open table) the staff brought out two desserts : a crème brule and  a chocolate torte. They also   took our picture for the site. Very attentive staff who were well versed about the items on offer. 

Price wise 2 steaks, an appy and a side with a bottle of wine and pint of beer was $250 (our desserts were on the house!)."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and wanted to go somewhere special for our anniversary.  The Phoenix area certainly has far more choices than Albuquerque so when we decided on Ruth's Chris I checked out the reviews and made an OpenTable reservation on Yelp, which worked out great.  

Our reservations were for a Sunday early evening and we were seated immediately.  Our server and bus staff were very helpful, patient and provided recommendations that we appreciated.  My starting drink (Tanqueray & tonic) was served quickly and made perfectly.  

The restaurant has a great, open dining area and a large patio with an outdoor fireplace to warm your bones on those balmy 105 degree Scottsdale evenings like when we dined.  

Since it was our first time dining at Ruth's Chris, our server explained a bit about the restaurant and the way they do things.  We ordered a salad, our entrees and sides as well as a glass of wine (the house cabernet blend - DELICIOUS).

The food and drinks were delicious, the service was excellent and the overall experience was excellent.  I normally order my steaks medium but on the server's recommendation I went with medium-rare Cowboy (Bone-In) Ribeye.  It was cooked a little more than I expected but was served sizzling and tasted DELICIOUS, especially when paired with the red wine mentioned above.  My wife ordered the Petite Filet and lobster tail, which was also delicious.  We had sides of mac and cheese (awesome) and garlic mashed potatoes (very good).  We finished the evening with bread pudding (very good) and coffee (excellent).

Although the prices can be high it really wasn't outrageous.  Obviously, wine & cocktails can escalate the bill quickly but we weren't disappointed with anything about our evening.  Although we certainly brought our appetites we were only able to eat ~ 1/2 of our meals and the staff was happy to box everything up for us to enjoy later.  

Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience at Ruth's Chris Steak House and we would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was amazing. My girlfriend and I been wanting to try Ruth's Chris and we finally gave in. We got Filet Mignon (medium rare and cooked perfectly, 8oz), Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was absolutely delicious! It was well worth the couple hundred dollar bill (wine to drink). The server was really nice and checked on us occasionally. A photographer came by and took a couple photos of us that we bought after dinner. I will definitely be coming back here every time I am in vegas!"}
{"text":"one word. Amazing. Had a really nice dinner here, the environment was calm and clean. Our waitress was super nice and very attentive. Make reservations ahead of time, you wont have to wait. Finding the elevator to reach it is a little tricky but just follow the signs throughout the casino and go one floor up. Food was really good!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one restaurant that will be saved for special occasions as it is SO expensive! That being said - the food is insanely delicious.
My husband and I decided to try Ruth's Chris out for his birthday since he's a steak lover.
We both ordered the Ruth's classic menu which is essentially a prix fix. You get a starter, entree, side and dessert for $53.99. There's not a whole lot of selection but that's because their steaks are generally $65+++ (sans sides). 
To start, he ordered gumbo and I had Cesar salad. Both delicious. For the entree, we both ordered the 6oz steak with shrimp, garlic mashed and steak fries for the middle of the table (I love my potatoes). I'm not a seafood lover by any means but that shrimp was to die for, and the steak?! Unreal. It comes to the table on a 500 degree plate, still sizzling and just melts like butter in your mouth. So so sooooo good!! 
For dessert, they brought us out the only dessert on the Ruth's classic. My only criticism is I had been ordering from the gfree menu all night and they brought me a regular dessert. It was swapped out as soon as I mentioned it but still irked me a bit. The gfree menu had the substitute written on it, but they brought me flourless chocolate cake instead, which was delicious. 
As a side note: they do have a gluten free menu and while it isn't huge, it's definitely good enough to adequately stuff yourself with deliciousness! 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every year for our anniversary. Absolutely LOVE it! We look forward to it every year. We really go all out and each get our own appetizer, drinks, main course, and dessert. My husband always gets the BBQ shrimp and I get the crab cakes. Both amazing!!! For our main course I get the petite fillet and shrimp and he gets the rib eye. Never been disappointed. Cooked to perfection. Sides are always wonderful too. Service is great too. I really have NOTHING bad to say. :)"}
{"text":"Ok, as I said in a previous Yelp, I love Ruth's Chris! For my birthday  February 14 of this year we hit the one in Vegas right before the \"O\" show. We actually took some friends that have never been before. 

I have to say my expectations were not meet. For the holiday week the restaurant is way over book. Although several people had long waits, we were able to get a table pretty quickly. the staff did there best to take care of the enormous crowd. 

The food was not up to the Ruth's Chris standard. The steaks did not have much flavor, for a table of eight half of us received food and others received only half of there dishes. After talking to the staff, we found out that they were using temps. Arrrrrrggggggg!

In comparison to the Ruth's Chris in New York, no comparison. The staff, full time  staff, still held up the Ruth's Chris standard, they were very nice, courteous and attentive. It was obvious that they were overwhelmed. If we go back it will be on a non-holiday or we may try the other restaurant which is just a few miles a way or just come to New York City to experience Ruth's Chris. Which is what we did with our friends when we came back to show them the truth."}
{"text":"Dinner was so delicious! The service was great. We were there Labor Day weekend on a Sunday. Not crowded. The manager came over to ask if there was a special occasion. The birthday girl had just turned 21 and the manager offered a drink of her choice on the house. We didn't get a window seat but the view was still very nice. Would definitely be back to have a special dinner again."}
{"text":"Being from Maryland, I know a thing or two about crabs (seafood in general).  Grant it, I've only been to the Baltimore location prior to my trip to the Toronto location, but Ruth's Chris has the best crab cakes I have ever tasted.  This location was no exception. 

I went about two weeks ago with my sister and a friend.  They are steak fans.  I am not.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer, calamari appetizer and a baked potato as my meal.  SOOO good.  The calamari had spicy/tangy flavor.  The crab cake were sizzling hot and yummy, as usual.

My sister got the filet oscar (with a crab cake and asparagus).  She thoroughly enjoyed her filet, though it wasn't as juicy as she had wanted (she orders her steak \"medium\").  My friend got the cowboy ribeye.  The thing was HUGE!  And \"very tasty\".

For dessert, we shared the cheesecake (DRY/crumbly and tasted a wee bit too sour) and the chocolate bread pudding (it was okay).

The service was lacking. Our server wasn't as attentive as she should have been.  It took about 10 minutes for us to get greeted by her.  Then, five minutes later, another server appeared to tell us the specials for the evening. Um...??  It was a bit confusing.  Our original server appeared after our food was served and then waited on us the remainder of the dinner.  

I'll definitely be returning to Ruth's Chris again... just maybe not this location."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks ago for a family dinner. My hubby and I got there early to have a drink before the rest arrived, so we got to experience a little more of the place. 

First, I've gotta say that the front desk staff and the lounge's bartender were 5 star quality. So friendly, quick, very professional. You get your parking reimbursed if you ask, by the way.

We ordered the family dinner prime rib special, which was the most reasonable price on the menu at $25 per person for 4 people. Here's where the issues start. The older lady server was rude and seemed more 'small town biker diner' attitude than 'fine dining'. She was downright awful. She threw plates onto our table, stepped on my husband twice (without apologizing), shoved through us to give and take menus, interrupted conversation rudely and seemed generally oblivious to how awful she was. There were only a few other tables, so it's not as if she was rushed. Having been in the service industry, I was APALLED that this woman had a job there. I'm not sure what else was going on because 2 other people came to our table to see how we were doing and they were both very polite and pleasant. I was outraged.

Next, the prime rib arrives. We also get asparagus, mashed potatoes and ceasar salad. The salad was the ONLY thing with flavour. Nothing else had any seasoning at all. I mean, nothing. I spent half of my dinner trying to cut away fat and grisle. $25 for this travesty of a \"meal\"? Ridiculous. I could spend half the money and enjoy a perfect steak with fixings at home. Without being stepped on or interrupted or accidentally slapped with a menu. 

Now, the atmosphere was STUNNING and I'm curious about whether the usual menu items are good. It just seems weird to me that the steaks are $40/plate and the atmosphere is so posh, while they allow that kind of crap \"food\" to leave their kitchen and that kind of \"service\" to work there."}
{"text":"As usual, Ruth's Chris doesn't disappoint.  Typical old school businessman hangout.  The best chain-restaurant steaks anywhere....ANYWHERE.  But, you will pay for it.  Almost $60 for my bone-in ribeye...with no sides.  But I will gladly pay it for this perfectly cooked, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth, perfect specimen of a slab of beef.  
Top-notch service too...very attentive and polite, but not snobby, and they know when to leave you alone. Good service should bring you everything you need, but should not be noticeable."}
{"text":"A friend insisted we have dinner here. 

The service was beyond friendly rather, down right annoying.  I really don' t care to hear my servers life story.

The stuffed mushrooms, quite tasty.... 

The steak, melt in your mouth goodness

the Au Gratin potatoes... disgusting little pieces of cardboard dripping in grease.    When a complaint was made to 'Mr. ever so talkative' server, he said. must be a bad au gratin night.  No offer to change it ... 

The creme brulee was scrumptious, though the berries served with it had seen better days... many better days."}
{"text":"This review is for their Happy Hour~~ I wish we had late night happy hour in Ca--but only in Vegas right?? They have HH from 4-6 and 11-3am daily and that includes 50% off their special items (they have a big selection to choose from from appetizers, salads, and small meals)... They had a really good selection too!!  You can get a petite fillet mignon (and I mean PETITE--SMALL) & lobster with asparagus for $12-13, which isnt bad for a small bite...try it blackened, its really good..and make sure you order their french onion soup!!! Its delicious..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Ruth's Chris.  Not a huge fan of this location.  The food is consistent with the other Ruth's Chris locations I've been to.  The service isn't on par with the other locations.

If you get the rib-eye, make sure you ask for center cut, otherwise you might end up with a NY strip-like rib-eye."}
{"text":"My wife and some friends went to Ruth's Chris for a couple of birthday celebrations in uptown Charlotte, on Sunday January 25th.  I have to say that the staff was outstanding and our server was really wonderful.  We had the filet and couldn't have been happier with the quality and taste.  This was my first time, and it will surely not be the last.  Very pleased with everything!  Next time, I will try the valet parking.  :)"}
{"text":"My cousins 35th birthday we came to Vegas. We are regulars at Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills. So we decided to try this one out for he first time. We walk in as we wait for our table to be set up me and my cousins go grab drinks at the bar. The bartender DOMiNic treated us like peasants. He charged my card for two drinks and I bought one my friend payed with cash. He kept her cash and charged my card for both drinks!! I was so pissed. The server Jessica was great she took great care of us. The manager Lisa Martin showed love she gave us 20% off our entire bill. I don't recommend this restaurant to huge parties if your a minority's because they treat u like u don't have enough money to pay the bill. I love the food but the service here isn't the best!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, and come here for every Valentine's day and our anniversary. The steaks are amazing, melt-in-your-mouth and delicious! But most of all we come here for the service; I don't think we've ever had mediocre or bad service at this location. 

I just learned that they're closing this one because the stupid building owners won't renew their lease, lame! We are so so sad, but hope to see some of our favorite servers at the other location (shout out to Ken and Shay!) :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Ruth's Chris steakhouse in San Francisco on a few different occasions and had great experiences and enjoyed great food.  So when we visited Las Vegas I made reservations here for my boyfriend's birthday.  They sat us in the corner by a frequently used staff door, didn't ask if we wanted to taste the wine before he poured, was just all around bad customer service, the potato side was overcooked, no birthday dessert as I'm accustomed to getting at the San Francisco location.  All around it was a let down and I will not return to this location.  Now I have to take my boyfriend to the Ruth's Chris in San Francisco to make up for this experience.  There are much better steak houses in Las Vegas, I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"We came last July n oh my gosh the best steak I've ever had!!!! Soo juicy n tender worth the $50 no sides just steak."}
{"text":"Expensive steak house but which one isn't any more.  Now that Vegas charges $18 for a well vodka soda, $67 steak is cheap. Not a fan of the crispy outside steak here. Inside was cooked perfect. But cream spinach was the best. Had bread pudding Excellent. recommend the mints on the way out."}
{"text":"I've always heard this was an amazing restaurant, but never had a chance to try it. My husband took me for New Year's Eve this year and I was absolutely delighted. 

The service was outstanding. I ordered the petite filet medium well and although it was a tad more on the well done side it was still hands down the best steak I've ever had. I love how they cook it in butter. It's extremely flavorful. My husband got the full size filet and we split the mashed potatoes, fire roasted corn and the grilled asparagus. It was all delicious. 

It's pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here. I called and made reservation for my family. On arrival we were promptly seated in a both. Our server was fantastic. While looking at the menu, the prices seemed expensive. Then was advised that was just for the meat and each side is $14. OMG this place is expensive!!!
Now, the food. It was absolutely fantastic from the Cesar salad to the steak and sides. Everything was cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the meal.
However, I cannot get past the prices here. That is the reason for the 1 star off. We would come back but would only be for a very special occasion."}
{"text":"Something must be wrong with us...we were not nearly impressed as the other reviewers..We decided to splurge one night because my husband does not gamble and he wanted to try there because its Sean Hannity's favorite place, so we both had a build up. We were told to get reservations, but it wasn't super busy.

Service was no where near what I expected. I figure if I am having a 200.00 dinner I should NEVER have to ask for a drink refill but we had to flag him down.
We were trying to order and felt rushed plus the waiter was adamant we could share the sides. Which I thought was odd but we order the filet and I ordered the 20 oz lobster. (He explained the small size was very tiny) 
The steak was good but it wasn't as good as expected. (Bob 's in Irving Texas beat the heck out of this piece of meat.)
We shared a potato( I don't k now why) We both asked for one but he was pretty sure we wanted to share...lol
We also shared the salad..which was prob a good idea it was not that great we left most of it on our plates. The lobster was VERY chewy and stringy ..of the 20 oz ..about 25% was not edible to me. Hate to say it but I've had better at Red Lobster.
We never got the bread replenished. Once we were served he flat forgot about us.
Needless to say...You should only order beef and do not try anything else...beef is obviously their specialty and it is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The steaks are so succulent, licks lips. Took my love her for his birthday dinner, well worth every dollar."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this chain streak house. This place is a little pricy as everything, for the most part, is a la carte. I usually order the 10oz filet mignon medium rare with potatoes au gratin, asparagus and my favorite, the sweet potato casserole with pecans and a side of Carmel (Hell ya)! I can't find a better dessert on their menu the the creme brûlée, it's absolutely fantastic and regardless of the food baby you may have, there's always room for creme brûlée at Ruths Chris."}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I celebrated our Wedding Anniversary, I made reservations at 5pm. I usually frequent the Las Vegas location when my mother and I drive up for some fun. My husband is a meat and potato guy and has never  had the opportunity to enjoyRuth Chris's. We arrived on time and was greeted warmly at the door. We were seated at a table in the middle by a very nice gentlemen who pulled my chair out. All the booths were reserved already. We were immediately given our menu's and told our waitress would be Krystal. The ambience of the dining room was delightful, the music was perfection. The lighting was just right. My husband looked impressed and that never happens.

We were greeted by our lovely Team member Krystal, she was so nice and had a pleasant way about her.she took our drink order and was very prompt. I noticed that all of the team members were well groomed,professional and worked together in unison like a well choreographed scene in a great movie, it was fun to watch, the view out of the windows was beautiful as well.

We ordered a split dinner of a Ceaser Salad with shaved parmigiana cheese, 16 ounce Ribeye and loaded baked potato, it was sizzling fantastic!!! our drinks were never empty and I cannot remember when the last time I had this great of service.The manager came to our table to make sure we were happy and by the time we were finished with our perfect dinner, Krystal said that she is bringing us dessert for our Anniversary, we could not believe how good the raspberry sorbet, key lime cheesecake and a salted raspberry nut chocolate bar was. I was disappointed that I left my phone at home so that we could get a picture of us together, But Krystal saved the day, she snapped a picture of us and brought it to us at the end of our night!

Thank you Ruth Chris's for a very lovely Wedding Anniversary Dinner."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious. 
We just had dinner here for the first time, for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. The filet and lobster tail, as well as the ribeye were, how do I put this?... Perfection. The raspberry cheese cake at the end really sealed the deal. Other than both being beyond stuffed at this point, I would most definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for good eats and excellent service.
Ask for Alejandro! He was our server and he was awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, but the prices are way too high...glad I got to try it once, though, so I know what a $300.00 meal tastes like (not much better than a $100.00 meal...just $200.00 more)."}
{"text":"I love Ruth Chris! Amazing wedge salad and filet! Had a very strong martini which is always a nice touch! Sit at the bar and they will take very good care of you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a birthday meal! My mom and I made early reservations at 5:30pm. We were kindly greeted with birthday wishes and promptly seated. We were then welcomed by the General Manager who was kind enough to bring complementary champagne for a birthday toast!

This was fabulous customer service. We then ordered stuffed crab mushrooms for an appetizer. We each had the Peppercorn Petite Filet (medium plus) and split a salad and baked potato. One of the best steaks I've ever had! 

Birthday celebration was completed with a wonderful creme brûlée. Totally recommend! Tony was our server and he did a wonderful job. The entire staff was very attentive and paced the meal well. Enjoyable experience and great birthday celebration! Will be back - hopefully before the next birthday"}
{"text":"Outstanding staff very friendly I would give them 100 stars if I could. The manager waked over when he heard we were celebrating our anniversary"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant but today it was a little off ...the service was a little off and the food was salty"}
{"text":"We came here in July on a Saturday around 5:00.  It was not busy during this time, and my husband and I were coming to celebrate our 5th anniversary.  We valet parked right in front of the restaurant which I believe was $8.  I'm not sure if they accept credit cards or not as we payed cash.  

We immediately were greeted by a friendly hostess, wished a Happy Anniversary and were escorted to our table.  At our table there was Happy Anniversary confetti and a card from the staff.  We both thought that this was a really sweet touch! 

Both our waiter and assistant waitress were friendly and provided excellent service.  The waiter asked us what pace we wanted our meal which I especially appreciated. 

Both my husband and I ordered off the 3 course menu, which changes seasonally.  I just checked their menu and it is different from when we came.  This is an awesome feature that allows you to try different things at different times of the year.  My husband ordered a blt salad which he said was really good and the 12 oz. ribeye.  His steak was cooked perfectly and was amazing!  I ordered the tomato and crab soup- the crab was good but the soup tasted like pure tomato sauce (I gave it to my husband after I ate all the crab)!  My second corse was the 6 oz filet and lobster tail.  The waiter took the tail off of the meat which I loved because I'm weird and hate looking at it!  My steak unfortunately was not great and well done (I ordered medium), I sent it back and the new steak was a 10/10!  We also got the dipping trio which consisted of black truffle butter, a mushroom sauce, and a honey soy glaze.  My husband and I both favored the honey soy glaze.  We got sides of mashed potatoes and corn which didn't disappoint! 

They brought us out a cute dessert that said Happy Anniversary and packed up the pineapple bread pudding (delicious) that came with our meals to go.  

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I can't wait to come back for my sister's birthday this fall!  I took off one star because I had to send my steak back and by the time it came back out my husband was finished with his food.  

I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion or if you have that kind of money to spend on dinner"}
{"text":"NOT the night for Ruth's or me. 48minute wait for a seat at a bar table.  (A must have to get happy hour). And then the fire alarm went off twice while dining...followed by praise & cheers from the patrons when the management finally got it quieted. Wait staff and managers took it in stride; ...wonder how many times this happens in a month?  Doesn't bode well for ambiance. 

So for the food. \"Ok\". Honestly, the steak was just OK (filet,rare) with a couple of stringy grizzled veins throughout. Really? I would expect better from Ruth's Chris. Ok, 500deg sizzle plate; more brand that sizzle unfortunately. The shrimp were a little dry and overcooked, and the presentation a little messy.  In all, something I can make at home without much fuss, and I would like to have enjoyed the date night out with a little more pleasantry (don't bother the bar tender - he doesn't like people unless they are his friends). :o(

Burger was good, but we expected better. From Ruth's Chris - the steaks, burgers, and chops should be something you write home about - not complaint about on Yelp."}
{"text":"Came here for the early prix fixe, which made this overpriced restaurant affordable. You get a starter, a main, a side and a dessert for the price of ~$60. Very worth it. The $12 glass of wine was good, but overpriced.

The caesar salad was pretty good. The steak was delicious. It melts in your mouth. The portion (11 oz. I believe) is quite big. It's a very tasty steak, and when you order it medium rare they actually make it medium rare. So many places overcook the meat it's insane, but these people know what they're doing. The dessert was called tartufo (I think), which is a sorbet/ice cream-like thing. It looked like a rare steak! Brown (chocolate flavoured) on the outside, red (berry flavoured) on the inside. I thought that was very creative and cute.

Service was very friendly, professional and efficient. The decor is nice, with wood all over the place. Very old-rich-people-..esque..?

Overall, this place is a solid 4 stars. Nothing super amazing, especially when it comes to the sides, but solidly tasty nonetheless. Go here for early prix fixe (ends at 6:30 I believe) and get the steak. Yummers."}
{"text":"Service was solid. Our steaks were delicious. Hate to spend that much....but I've spent more. Overall worth going back to."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Ruth Chris's Steakhouse for our Anniversary. I had heard so many good things about this steakhouse, that I couldn't wait to try the food. I knew it was going to be expensive as it was a 4 star restaurant. Also when we got there at 4:30pm on a Sunday, it was pretty much empty. Only one other couple was there. We were seated quickly. We ordered some water and glass of champagne to toast each other. We ordered steak of course, with garlic potatoes and some veggies. The potatoes were good, but the steak was just average at best. It wasn't juicy enough or moist. It didn't melt in my mouth either like Texas Roadhouse's steaks. The veggies were average. Nothing special. We did get dessert which was delicious, but the experience wasn't the greatest. The waiter was pretty quiet. He did explain the wine & champagne menu. Also cleaned food off the table, etc.. Still, I had a better experience at Carraba's in Scottsdale where I purposed to my wife. The meal was over $100, which really wasn't worth it. I got a better meal for 4 people at Texas Roadhouse for about the same price. The steaks, sweet potatoes, and veggies were better. I won't be going back to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse anytime soon unless I get a $50 gift card or coupon. Unless you're filthy rich and don't care much about the quality of food, don't even waste you money. There are much better Steakhouses in the valley.

Update: 4/6/2016 - They are CLOSED now I see. I can understand why. The food was not good and whoever Ruth Chris is would not have been happy eating at this restaurant. I wonder what restaurant replaced this one."}
{"text":"Excellent service - we hosted a group of 20+ and the serving staff were excellent.  The food - oh man, always great steaks.  And the sides - mushrooms, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and I think we tried some of each- all were great!

Next time I'll try a filet as others said they were really tasty.  

It's upstairs so you have to wait for a tiny elevator to get up or just take the stairs."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE experience. Left before we were even seated. Hostess had customer service skills that would be better suited toward a truck stop than a supposable 5 star destination on the Las Vegas Strip. Rude, rolled her eyes, made derogatory remarks about members of our party. Completely mind blowing to say the least. It's obvious she didn't earn the position based on her level of hospitality. Let me be the one to break it to you... Your a hostess not a Kardashian learn to treat your GUESTS with respect. Caesars should be ashamed that this is the quality of employee they choose to represent their brand. Terribly disappointed all around."}
{"text":"Great meal. Excellent food, but our waiter Russ made the evening perfect and fun."}
{"text":"Anything else and I would be lying. Where do I start Food,Service 5 star Price 5 Star you get what you pay for here. Crab Cakes Bone in Rib Eye ahhh get your steak 1 rareer than you want.it will cook to the next level on your plate. Napkins up."}
{"text":"Oh QC Restaurant week...how I love thee.

And How I'm glad I was talked into going to Ruth's Chris during this weeks' Queen's Feast!

What I got:

1.  Chorizo and white bean soup - Yumm-o
2.  The 6 oz Filet and Garlic Mash-tatters - yumm-o
3.  Three of the desserts on the QF menu (sample sizes) - BONUS!

What I didn't get:

Don't have any regrets coming to Ruth's Chris!  Waiter was awesome, funny and is getting married in June and we just might get an invite.  Great place..and will def do this one again.  

They offered four different items under the King's Feast entree section that was $10 more.  Loved it but glad I didn't get it.  I saw the Filet that was on that menu and it was a small cow.  Huge.  

My stomach and pocket book thanks you RC......"}
{"text":"Not always getting everything right as in the U.S. Locations but when they do 
Fantastic food !
Steak lobster and classic appetizers and sides"}
{"text":"So yeah, good steaks. But you knew that. The real reason you go to Ruth's Chris is to show off. Prove to the customer you're trying to woo that you have a big enough per'diem to cover an expensive bottle of wine and fine piece of cow. But that's ok. At this Ruth's Chris, you'll actually get a really nice bit of cow. My suggestion to you is to waive off the petitie filet mignon. I mean really? Your mother wouldn't even order something that starts with 'petite' and she's 4'9\". Go for the Ribeye. It's the most succulent, tasty morsel on the cow and for the love of everything that is good in this world, don't get a crust on it. Just stop with the blue-cheese crusts already. Want blue cheese? Get a Wedge Salad. Lovely. Trust me on the Ribeye. It will ruin you for other bits of cow."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect - last minute reservations on Open Table for our b'day steak dinner coupled with 1star to 5 star reviews from my fellow Yelpers.

Love the Beverly Hills location.  1st time at the LV one.

Our server Bobbie was a doll.  He was funny, attentive & accommodating.  My 1/2 of the group got there on time and sat at the bar for a bit.  Bartender lady was very nice & makes some strong but flavorful drinks (friend ordered Washington Apple shots).

My medium rare ribeye came out perfect & sizzling on that hot platter of butter.  Sides of baked potato & asparagus were spot on.  We were even served a comp side of mushrooms (pretty good too!).

I guess we were lucky in that fact that all our food was delicious - so much that we couldn't eat dinner.

Only item that was a little off was the chopped salad.  I had it in BHills before & it was delicious!  I split it with my b/f...it was - dry?  I mean there was practically no salad dressing at all...not even lightly tossed - I got the flavoring from their bacon bits.  That was the only downside to the meal - it looked pretty...just tasted like a carnivorous rabbit's food."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations before, but this review is on the Toronto location on Richmond. 

Their steaks are good, however I'm not loving the price so much..If you really want to spend money on steak, go to Gallaghers (NYC) and you won't be disappointed. 

Rating: 3.5 stars 

PROS
We ordered the Filet and the New York Strip, however my boyfriend was talked into getting the Sirloin. 

The Filet was cooked to a perfect rare. Juicy, tender and seasoned well and I love how the plates are still hot with butter so I could sear it a bit more for my boyfriend to try at medium rare. 

The Sirloin wasn't bad, but I think the New York Strip would have been a better choice with more flavour and less tough. 

Dessert: shared a chocolate Sin cake, which was deliciously rich. 

Drinks: (standard bar & wine list)
Cappuccino is good. 

Service: Good, the server was experienced, attentive, knew what she was doing and anticipated what we needed without question. At times we felt she was a bit authoritative. Very take charge of service kind of boss lady, it's not a bad thing and I'm not sure how to explain this, but it made for an intriguing night. We had fun lol. 

CONS
Appetizer: The crab cakes were not anything to write home about ($26 for 2 pieces). I would skip this and go for a salad instead. This is coming from a seafood lover.

The steaks are $5 more than they were last year ($65) 

The sides also went up in price ($14ea). The portions are big enough to share. We ordered the mushrooms and this sliced potato dish baked in 3 cheese sauce. Mushrooms were tasty but could have done with less salt. I'm torn on the potatoes as  I was feeling for mashed potatoes and not expecting blue cheese in the sauce, however my boyfriend loved the potatoes. 

$245 PLUS Tip (Not including alc)  is kind of steep so make sure you really like who you're taking here 

TIP: 
1. Order from the classics menu $55 set menus with 3 course meal
2. Buy a gift card at Costco lol (1card per person per visit though) 

3. This place had a nice intimate atmosphere, except when they started seating kids and babies at the tables around us halfway through dinner. The children didn't make much noise and were well behaved so we didn't mind, but just a heads up for those looking for a more adult atmosphere- maybe give the hostess a heads up and see if they can accommodate an adult only section..

4. Parking under hotel is $10 flat rate after 6pm on weekdays. Although I think they should validate it if they charging you arm and leg already."}
{"text":"Such a great night! We have visited many Ruth Chris steakhouses and this was an exceptional evening. Jeff and Caroline were exceptional and as usual with Ruth Chris it was a great meal."}
{"text":"my husband and I have been going for so many years and I can honestly say that there has never been an instance in which we were less than satisfied. The filet melts in your mouth, the salad portion are generous, and with JUST the right amt of dressing. The staff is amazing, and very accommodating!  Try the lobster mac and cheese, it is an out-of-body experience."}
{"text":"We visited the steakhouse during restaurant week in Arizona. The steaks were arguably one of the best I've ever had. 

Both my ribeye and my boyfriend's fillet mignonette were cooked perfectly. 
I also recommend getting the blue cheese crust on top of the ribeye. 

The best part of this restaurant was definitely the service. Our waiter found the perfect balance between making sure we had what we needed and not interrupting the mood or conversation. 

If there was one thing that could've been improved it would've been the sides. The sweet potato casserole was very rich with too much brown sugar and the crabcake wasn't great either. 

All in all it was a fantastic experience and would definitely recommend the steakhouse."}
{"text":"I think this is the BEST place to have steak EVER!  I've eaten at Ruth's over 30 times.  I love the sizzling steak with butter.  I have always had my cowboy rib eye cooked to perfection.  I have always loved the freshness of that cold butter with fresh n' hot bread.  It's always cold and fresh with no other flavors absorbed in the butter.  The salads are all fantastic!  So fresh!  I've had every side dish and I love them all.  The desserts and dessert wines are perfect.  All of the wines are great too.  Shirley Temples are so nice.  

I've always had excellent service at the Camelback location.  (One in Vegas had slow service but they were very busy and I think understaffed and Scottsdale location was just alright - not as attentive as Camelback location)

Yes, it is expensive.  We expect that when we go.  I think it is VERY much worth it though.  They have the right to serve ala carte.  The prices aren't outrageous.  The food is very, very good.  The sides are the perfect size.  

I also like the way they wrap the leftovers to go in nice boxes and bags.   

To comment on a few of the other postings here...the servers tell you the plate is sizzling hot.  They even ask you to raise your napkin over your chest as they set it down.  The guy who burned his hand should have been warned.  Sorry if he wasn't.  And the butter is what makes it so special and wonderful.  The servers tell you that it comes with the butter.  It is not swimming.  They put a little pad on the top at the last moment and that hot plate keeps your steak hot.  As for people who have had bad service and wrong steaks, that is not the norm.  

I have never had a better rib eye.  We try to do it like Ruth's at home, but it's never quite the same.  Never had any of their other steaks.  I also recommend the stuffed chicken.  Oh my!  Again on the chicken, the butter and sizzling makes it AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about the steaks at this chain and finally had the pleasure of visiting with a good friend. The food is pricey compared to my normal dinner price point, but for a special occasion, this is a GREAT option! The portion size was generous and the quality reflected everything I had heard.

We were told by the hostess there was a wait, despite seeing several empty tables. This was a bit annoying, but we decided to sit at the bar for a drink while we waited. We were greeted by Camacho and he offered that we could order food with him, so we did that. Both he and Josh gave excellent information and made sure everything was on point. 

The steaks are cooked at 1800 degrees and served on a 500 degree plate, but start with the crab stuffed mushrooms before rushing to the entree. They were fantastic. Camacho answered numerous questions and made great recommendations on the filet, lobster mac n cheese, wine pairing, and after dinner drink. **Please use a ride sharing service if consuming alcohol**

When dining here, skip the hostess stand and head straight to the bar for top-notch service and an incredible steak!"}
{"text":"What a meal. Went here with my mom and boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and got the porterhouse to share, creamed spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes au gratin and we were all blown away. The food was phenomenal as well as the service. Yes, a pricy meal when you add in a bottle of wine, a few drinks before our meal and dessert but worth every penny. The steak could not have been more delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"The steaks were awesome. That's the only good thing I have to say, because everything else was disappointing. Our server gave off a condescending and judgemental vibe. The salad had been sitting in the cooler for a couple of days - the wilted greens, tomatoes and red onions were a dead giveaway. The roasted corn was supposed to have jalapeños in it, but the dish appeared and tasted like it came out of a can. Potato gratin was undercooked, with potatoes cut a little too big. Creminis appeared to have been cooked ahead of time, sitting in their black juice, which tells me it wasn't freshly prepared. Like I said, the steaks were awesome, which we expected. What we didn't expect was the questionable service, and the sad, overpriced sides. The creme brulee was completely half-assed, with sugar crystals that never quite melted. Not worth the price. I think people go to Ruth's Chris for a good steak, and to have a great experience. Unfortunately, the only good thing about this place was the steak."}
{"text":"Good service, good food but a little on the pricey side. I ordered a filet and lobster bisque with shoe string fries, mashed potatoes and asparagus. I was satisfied and it fixed the craving I had for meat! Lol.. thankfully I had a Gift card to use otherwise I probably wouldn't have gone because our bill at the end after tax and tip was a good $300! Ouch!!"}
{"text":"The best place to get a steak, anywhere.

The filet is their signature, and if you have never been, that is what you should order.  It's always perfect.

The sides are also excellent, pick anything.  Dessert too.

This place is expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"I was here on a Wednesday with my in laws at 6:30. It was darker in the restaurant than it was outside. 

Other than the lighting, the food was pretty good. If you're not looking to get steak, try the stuffed chicken. It was surprisingly amazing! We had raspberry sorbet for dessert and that was delicious as well. I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town! This is one of my favorite chain restaurants and they fit into the vegas scene perfectly! Always great food, always great service!"}
{"text":"This place I have been wanting to try for a long time.  I was very impressed with the service and amount of attention that I got throughout my visit.  I had the lobster bisque which was so creamy and flavorful.  Just perfect if you ask me! I also had a fall salad with goat cheese. It was one of the best salads I have ever had.  We ordered the filet and it melted in my mouth!!! Love!!! Want to come back soon."}
{"text":"Visited Ruth's Chris tonight for my girlfriend's Mom's Birthday (Mom's request). The decor in this place is dated and the sign outside is only partially illuminated (ominous sign). The bathrooms were dated and slightly dirty. Walking in I thought oh no, this place is living off past glory. After we were seated our server disappeared for an extended period of time. We finally got our drinks and all was right with the world for a while. Our order came out and one of the dishes was sea bass and it was supposed to be shrimp. They took the fish back and about 10 minutes later the shrimp came out. The server offered zero concessions and only said \"I cannot read my own handwriting\". Seriously ? At a fine dining establishment, you cannot read your writing? And then not to at least offer a glass of wine? Bad form Kenny. The sea bass was delicious. The lobster Mac and Cheese was elementary and tasteless - like Kraft Mac and cheese with lobster on top. Brussel sprouts were decent, but nothing to get excited about. The late arriving shrimp was flavorful. The chicken dish had the worst presentation I have ever seen at a restaurant - seriously it looked ugly. The chicken had a good flavor, but looked like a 5th grader prepped the plate. I would give the food 3.5 stars, restaurant decor and bathrooms 1 star, and the service a 1.5 stars. Mark my words - Ruth's Chris will not survive. Like the T-Rex before it - they have not evolved / adapted so they will surely perish. Please try Steak 44, Mastro's Steak House, or Dominick's Steakhouse instead of wasting your money on this dinosaur."}
{"text":"Hole-e-shit.  

This place is expensive.  Don't kid yourself.  It is one of those places that you go to when you want to treat yourself, or the people you are with, good.  I mean REAL good. You will drop at least $150/pp.  

The fillet was $56.   I got the lobster tail which was Marketing Price/$100.  It.was.huge.   It could have been slightly less cooked, however, still delicious.  Everyone was sharing their cuts of meat, which are a la cart.  I tasted the Rib eye, fillet, lamb.  All delicious and mouth watering.  

The highlight though was the Prisoner wine which was a cabernet blend from californian.  Also, the spicy (not at all) lobster appetizer was my favorite.  Think of the best orange chicken you have ever had, but with lobster!  

Highly recommend for an amazing date night or any special night.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on our anniversary. Hands down these were the best steaks we ever had. He had the tomahawk ribeye pictured below and I went with the filet, both were cooked to perfection! If you're looking for a side try the sweet potato casserole :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I felt like a queen. Best fine dining experience of my life!"}
{"text":"OK, so I was always taught if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all ... but REALLY?!

Dropped by this place after catching a Cirque show with a close friend, and we ended up here because it was open so late (kudos to whoever extended their hours so late, because Smith and Wollensky was shut)

Waiter seemed pretty tipsy. :/ Though he was a nice guy.
The other wait staff insisted on reaching all over our table and obsessively removing things that really could have been left where they were until the end of our meal - OCD perhaps?

Food took a long time to appear and they forgot an item or two.

Hey ... at least my martini was good ;)"}
{"text":"OMG....the restaurant is awesome but the service was even better.
I have lived here for over 20 years and I haven't had a server like this in a very long time. Ask for Caesar and wait for him if needed."}
{"text":"Nice service, the food so so. I ordered lamb chops thinking I cook steak at home all the time, they were cooked to perfection, but lacking in flavor....boring actually (surprisingly so).  I  also tasted the Fillet Mignon  and Porter House steaks, and they were same... just average in flavor. All entrees  are a la carte, that's ok, but the presentation on the plate lacked all color  (I know you can't eat color, but other steakhouses seem to present a la carte plates without this feeling of nakedness).  

Not to date myself too badly here but In fact the whole thing reminded me of a an upscale (in it's prime) steakhouse circa 1975; not in a classic vogue way but in a \"this needs an update\" way.  You could go to OutBack Steakhouse and have a better meal for 1/4 the price. Not what I was expecting.  All in all... I don't think you get your bang for the buck but nothing was horribly wrong per se."}
{"text":"I ate at the one in Las Vegas and it's expensive but worth it. The service is good and they were really helpful in showing us how to order and what to get for cheap and what's better or easier. It was a great delicious dinner but I don't have the money to go there a lot. Lol."}
{"text":"We're talking about meat and butter. How can you go wrong!

Booked another dinner for my birthday this year.  Ruth's Chris is known for steaks and for good reason. Holy cow. Pun intended. 

It's a shame we had an awful waiter. Our bus boy was great. The manager on duty went above and beyond.  But the waiter couldn't give two craps about us. What a shame. 


We had Caesar salads for appetizers. Nothing spectacular but great nonetheless. 

We both had the combo 6oz mignon with shrimp. Mine came overdone but they remade it in 3 minutes.  Actually. They tasted great!

The side dishes are terrible. They always were and they always will be. We won't be ordering any again. Our meals came with side dishes so we tried the mashed potatoes and south west Mac and cheese.  Pass on them. 

We finished with a turtles cheese cake. Meh. 

Regardless. We come here for the steaks and we will return for the streaks. 

They have a few things to fixed up before they get a 5 star rating. 

I'll be back. Man I love their meat. That's what she said. 


-------------
And I'm back! 
Oh man. What a visit. We felt like royalty. Service is incredible and the food never disappoints. 

We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms. Nice app

I had the ribeye. I mean it's a huge piece of meat. Tender and juicy. Could have been a bit more flavourful but that's just me being picky. 

Wife had the filet and shrimp. She loved it as usual! 

It was her birthday (for real) so they treated us to a nice chocolate tart like dessert. Delish!

Tapash has been there for 20 years! Top notch service! 

Oh ya shoestring potatoes were bland. So far, each of their side dishes I've ever tried lacked any flavour or refinement. Not the reason I come here though so I don't mind. 

See you soon!"}
{"text":"We go to this Ruth's about 6 times a year. Went today for Fathers Day and the service was fabulous. \"El\" was are server and she was great!

{"text":"I had been wanting to try Ruth's Chris since it opened at 200 Public Square. I decided to go during Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week. I knew it was a big chain, so I was expecting everything to be delicious. However, it was just \"okay\". 

The ambiance was great - more wine bottles than I've ever seen in any restaurant. Multiple floors with different ambiance at each level. 

I ordered the lobster bisque to start and it was okay. Not as good as some other places in Cleveland like South Side for one. 

My steak was ordered medium well and came out medium, which was fine. It was tasty and seared well. The shrimp on top were well seasoned and I honestly like them more than my steak. I enjoyed the extra butter and dip all of my protein into it for some extra flavor. 

I ordered the mashed potatoes as my side and I wasn't impressed at all. Absolutely nothing special about them. 

The vanilla ice cream was Haagen Dazs and was good. Apple cheesecake was just okay. I don't personally like crunchy apples inside of my cheesecake.

3 courses for $40, which was a $6.95 discount from their normal pricing. Valet was $8 or they will validate the parking garage for $5 and you can stay 4 hours."}
{"text":"Food was as always delicious...prices however are over the top. Waiter was miffed that we asked to see winterlicious menu...so the old dude was crusty. He needs to retire. Our bill for 4 with a cocktail each and a 65$ bottle of vino ( 20$ at lcbo-sorry that's gouging.)Was 450$ and we all had the 48$ winterlicious deal. 

A great evening if you have no respect for your money. 

Btw Everyone else who worked there could not have been nicer."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? The service is phenomenal, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food is spectacular. There are many great steakhouses in Cleveland but it only took one meal here to solidify Ruth's Chris as my new favorite. In terms of recommendations, the crab stuffed mushrooms are delicious and the lobster mac and cheese is out of this world. We only tried two steaks (the petite filet and the strip) but I am sure any steak you order will be fantastic. Do yourself a favor and eat here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few nice steak houses and so far, Ruth's Chris has been my favorite. Excellent steaks, wine, and choices of bourbon. Every time I go somewhere else, they are compared to this place. Awesome. Definitely let them know in advance if you are there for a special occasion and they will take care of you."}
{"text":"Amazing food quality, it is high end for sure , and the Vegas on the strip branch is more expensive than others, Ruth Chris's is always my favorite in every city I go to. 
  The stuffed chicken is my fave there , and of course the filet steak."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at Ruth's Chris and van honestly say it was by far the best steak and Caesar salad I've had in a long time. Pricey, but the ambience and service are unparalleled! A special treat to be sure, and not to be missed if you are a lover of fine food, special attention and elegant yet plush and comfortable surroundings."}

{"text":"This location is off compared to other Ruth's Chris locations I've been to.  The lobster bisque didn't taste right and my lamb chops were swimming in butter, overcooked, and fatty. For the price, I should expect to receive lean cuts of lamb but these were, by far, the fattiest chops I've ever had. The service was great, although our waiter was not as friendly as usual. I will still frequent Ruth's Chris but not this location."}
{"text":"I love seafood and it's rare I eat red meat but when the cravings hits me, I'm dying to sink my teeth into something juicy, rare, succulent, tender, and have loads of great flavour.  I don't mind paying for it as I've learned the hard way that a lousy grade of beef = lousy meal.  That being said, I DON'T like overpriced meals that leave you wanting more or feeling ripped off.  Ruth's Chris is good but for me, it teeters over into the overpriced territory.

The restaurant is your typical business lunch environment.  Lots of leather, brown wood tones, neutral modern touches, and open area.  It's clean and tables are well spaced so you're not sitting on someones lap.

When you're paying for over $100 per person for a meal, there has to be some serious skill in the kitchen.  Whether it be innovative cooking, great pairings of flavours, or phenomenal out of this world (or at least Toronto) ingredients.  With RC, it's not innovative cooking, no creative juices for unusual or amazing pairings, and the ingredients are good ... but do they require $100++ per person?  Uh no.  When I came here,  I ordered a filet, side of asparagus, side of broccoli, glass of wine, and banana cream pie.  

Sure the filet was 'sizzling' in butter and that's kinda unique but if the steak needs butter to flavour it, that's a little sad.  My steak was cooked as requested (rare) and it had some good char but I wasn't wow'd by the flavour.  I know tenderloin isn't the most flavourful piece but compared to my other steaks at home or at Jacobs & Co, this one fell into the 'meh' territory for taste.  The veggie sides were ok as they were buttered to heck but they were slightly UNDER cooked.  It's better than being soggy, limp, and yellow but I had to use my steak knife to cut through the broccoli!!  The dessert was tasty enough but nothing made it wow.  

Another big reason for saying Ruth Chris is overpriced is service... of lack there of.  The hostess barely looked us in the eye and seated us in the 'hallway' where servers moved often between rooms and kitchen area.  Considering there was a lot of tables open in the room, I was surprised she sat us and another couple in this spot.  Our server was going through the process.  He was neither horrible or fantastic but just competent enough to not make any impression (negative or positive).  He may have visited our table twice at most.  He was always staring off into the room or at other servers while at our table.  It was clear he didn't want to be there and we felt the same after his first visit.

If the price of this steakhouse was cheaper, I'd say it's a-ok but I found this place to be not much better than the Keg. If anything, the service at the Keg was better than here and I only paid $90 for 2 people there!  Next time I'm dying for steak, I'll skip this place and either pay the super price of Jacob or head to my local Keg to just satisfy my carnivorous craving."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for many years to the point R/C automatically places us in our favorite booth each time, without asking.  The service/food has ALWAYS been excellent.  If it's true the landlord wouldn't renew the lease, I will no longer patronize any shops in that complex.  Hopefully, R/C will move to a nearby location and take the same staff with them--probably the best restaurant/service of any similar restaurant in the Valley and in fact, I live in Scottsdale and drive by the Scottsdale R/C just to have dinner at the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Amazing Dining experience. Joe Lazar is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy. We enjoyed having our 2nd wedding anniversary dinner here. The food was delicious and done to order. A few things to improve 1.) dear waitress, its a formal/ semi formal dinning experience,  please behave as such. You were very nice, but some of us to like to enjoy the formality of the environment 2.)my husband asked for all dishes to be brought out at the same time,  which he was told no problem, they all arrived at different times.  We will definitely be back, but hopefully they experience will be a little better. Thank you for the anniversary cake."}
{"text":"While I tend to avoid chains, this was a gift certificate we needed to spend. Luckily Ruth's Chris does not feel like a chain - the manager is very much in charge and passionate about his work, as are all the employees.

We had an amazing dinner here last night. From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs. The waiter (Francisco) was also a seasoned wine pro - he helped us pick the perfect wine and even took the time to recommend and write down some store bought Pinot Noirs we might enjoy later. 

The steak here is perfection. Aged, prime meat served on a 500 degree plate with butter. This is right up there with Morton's, Donovan's, and Flemming's! She tried the Steak and Lobster and while the lobster was very good - stick with steak!

The staff all pitched in to keep my diet coke full. Excellent teamwork!

In summary: at $100 a person they earn every penny!

- Sorry you caught them on a bad night Donald!"}
{"text":"One of the best steak restaurants in the city. I have consistently been treated to top shelf food and service here. I prefer the Indian Bend location, though the Camelback spot is convenient for business dinners.

Sorry to hear about Sarah's misadventure, I have not yet tried their seafood -- Ruth's Chris is all about premium aged steaks to me."}
{"text":"Sigh, delicious meat. This place has it all - steaks, lobster, lamb chops, prime rib, every kind of protein you fantasize about eating. The portion sizes are huge. All entrees come with meat only - you pick your salads and sides all at additional cost on the side. 

I tried the ahi tuna, seared and served rare with crab meat on top and a spicy sauce. I also has a side of giant beefsteak grilled tomatoes. Tuna was awesome and my DC's steak I sampled was delish (as expected).

The interior is decorated in typical old school posh steakhouse style - dark mahogany, rich carpeting, chandeliers, etc. I heard rumours of a roaring fireplace but that must have been in another room. 

Our service was A+. Very attentive but not overly doting. Food came out quickly too.

Decent wine list with glasses starting from $11."}
{"text":"I frequent RCSH and this one was right down the middle. Enjoyed the experience. Mr Muscle had not been to one - and he loved it. Started with shrimp cocktail. HUGE, ice cold (a must) and delicious, slightly spicy cocktail sauce ($16 for 4). We were sat at a table near the bar, not cool but didn't feel like pushing the subject, it is also across from the waiters station which is right out in the open (which means I have to hear all about their escapades from the night before.. like dude, like dude...blah blah) . If you are going for a big night, don't accept this table. Our waiter was Francisco and we got off slightly on the wrong foot because he is having to push the brand - maybe due to the 50th anniversary but it was uncomfortable - the history and stats on RCSH - not so much.  He quickly and completely redeemed himself by pointing out the 'Favorites Menu\" thereby shaving $50 dollars off our bill.  He was extremely helpful and having dined at Ruths Chris not less than 5 times in the last 60 days, he was the ONLY one to mention the substitutions and upcharges - he was a winner. Filet (medium rare) and the ribeye (medium) were perfect and delicious - Mr Muscle said it was in the top 5 steaks of all time. Standard baked potato and broccoli au gratin. All good. Only disappointment was the house salad. Completely warm mixed greens and wilted - totally bummed it out as this is one of the highlights for me. Love their house salad with blue cheese. They should not have served that lettuce. Period. Otherwise, kudos to Franisco (we used the money he saved us to tip him a bit more -!! ) and a delicious steak. You can never go wrong with Ruths Chris"}
{"text":"I know I will upset some fellow Yelp friends with this review, but the Ruth Chris on Camelback was a big disappointment for me. I went with a friend who is a huge fan of Ruth Chris, but I was let down with this location. 

Atmosphere: This location makes a better Chili's location than Ruth Chris. The setup is very awkward and to have to leave the restaurant to go to the bathroom in the lobby (which by the way looked like my high school restroom) is not very high end. I have seen single $ restaurants with a better atmosphere.

Food: The steak quality was very good, but I have had many more filets elsewhere (Gibson's Chicago) that have given me much more flavor. My filet was served in a pool of butter. I guess I am more of a fan of a well seasoned steak than a steak soaked in butter. The sides are very average and once again there are steak places in PHX that offer a much more exciting sides menu.

Service: This is the only thing that was worthy of mentioning. Devin at the bar served us and he was 5 stars plus. Great service! He also gets huge kudos for his Martinis. He knows how to poor them! Devin saved Ruth Chris from getting 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Let's see where do I start. Everything is all a cart. And most of the sides and soups or solids that we had we're halfway unedible. PS please stay away from the lobster bisque it literally look like and tasted like roadkill soaked in mud. The side of potato's with 3 cheese on them was so disgusting I barely had the stomach to  take half a bight. Not to mention their ''famous signature steaks''. The porterhouse for two which cost $90 tasted disgusting and burnt. And they served it on a plate full of butter. Probably to mask how nasty the steak was. The service oh my goodness god awful.  If there's one thing worse than the food it was the service. We were in there for 2 hours. And the place was dead. So if you feel like spending $200 on throw up food and awful service go right ahead."}
{"text":"For a $125 meal, my expectations were not met. My boyfriend and I went to celebrate his promotion and reserved a table at 9:30 on a Saturday night. When we sat down we were approached by our waitress who failed to ask why we had come in, and furthermore failed to suggest any of their specials. A few minutes before receiving our salads we finally received our waters after waiting at least 15 minutes. Once we had finished our mediocre salads (three croutons and 1 and a half cherry tomatoes per dinner salad), we finally reviewed our wine. My caeser salad was bland at best. My boyfriend had the steakhouse salad with a decent bleu cheese dressing. While waiting for our steaks, a couple sat down next to us, ordered relatively the same meals, and had much better service. Their waiter was attentive, delivered their food and drinks in a timely fashion, asked for their valet parking slip and delivered their bill to them ALL before our waitress could even deliver our desserts. I finally got my last glass of wine (I had ordered with my steak) after I was finished with my dessert. Our waitress would have been average at an Applebee's. Our experience at Ruth's was subpar."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was the service. It gave redemption to Vegas steak houses for us."}
{"text":"This place is a classic and it certainly lived up to its reputation as a top notch dining experience. The ambience is swanky. We went to celebrate my moms birthday and they had everything set up on the table with birthday confetti. Our server was extremely accommodating- especially taking the time to explain the gluten free meal options. The GF bread was delicious, a warmed up mini loaf. I had the Ruth classic. It comes with a salad, entree/side, and dessert. I got the Caesar salad, broccoli, and filet with shrimp. Delicious! For dessert, the berries and cream were superb. Overall, wonderful dining experience and will be back here !"}
{"text":"Went to RC before the theatre and was a little disappointed - food was good, service a little awkward and the bill was 194 for 2 before the tip. That included dinner, drinks, shared appetizer and shared dessert. I felt the bill was $50 too high for comparable options in the area and will go elsewhere next time.
Despite the concern for value, the highlight for me was the Banana Creme Pie."}
{"text":"This is now my second time going to Ruth's Chris, and there is nothing bad I can say about tonights experience. From the moment we were seated until we got our bill, everything went well.
The break that was served to us was a french baguette. Perfectly warm and just the right amount of chewy/crusty on the outside.
For appetizers we had stuffed mushroom caps and lobster bisque. The caps didn't do anything to warrant a complement, but I did enjoy the lobster bisque. There was a certain sweetness to it which made it really enjoyable. An appetizer I had there my previous visit was carpaccio. It is a large slice of raw (or blue rare) beef with some sauce on top of it. It doesn't sound very good but I would recommend someone try it (especially if you are a meatitarian).
Our main dishes included a ribeye, a buffalo ribeye, and some steak fries (all pictured). I don't know where they are getting their potato from but it is huge. (Aside: For those that don't know, you each order a main steak, and then order a potato and/or vegetable to share a la carte).
A nice a crispy potato, it was a good complement to the steak.
As for the steak itself, the buffalo ribeye was really good. There was something different about it (a little more gamey taste to it?) but it was sizzling and delicious.
The service was also very fast and efficient. The waiter was polite, attentive, and checked back just the right amount of times to make sure we were ok. I'm not sure if this is protocol here, but the waiter actually addressed me as Mr. Peleshok. Who does this? This is a first for me and I was impressed he went the extra mile.
There was no room for desert because the steaks were quite large mixed in with the good bread and appetizers.
The only knock I have (and its obvious), is that each steak plate is between $45-$55. In my opinion no steak should cost that much, but I can understand why they charge what they do in terms of giving out the image of an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll spare the details of why, and jump straight into it. The atmosphere in here is elegant and intimate, with its beautiful wooden finishes and dim lighting. The staff are all very friendly and cater to your needs quite promptly. I have no complaints at all about the service. Quick, friendly, and polite service will always be an award winner in my book. 

As for the food, we both had the Ruth clam chowder, filet and shrimp (side of lyonnaise potatoes and mashed potatoes) and apple crumb cheesecake to finish.

The bread they give you to start is very crisp on the outside with a warm soft centre. Served with whipped butter, it paired very well with our clam chowder. The clam chowder was creamy, well seasoned, and briney with clam taste the way I like it. I only wish it was a bit thicker.

As for the steak, I had asked for medium rare, but it was cooked a bit more than I would have liked. Maybe I should have asked for rare. I also would have liked a little more seasoning on my steak. Nonetheless, it was juicy and went very well with those mashed potatoes. The lyonnaise potatoes were okay. Think sweet garlic roasted potatoes. But those mashed potatoes were thick, creamy, and had a steak and bacon-like taste to them. I should have gotten them instead.

The apple crumb cheesecake was pretty good. I especially loved the cookie pieces at the top, and the little chunks of apple inside.

Overall, it was a very good experience. The service was top notch and the food was good. Not the best steak I've ever had, but definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"It is great but compared to other Ruth's Chris in North America, both the service and the food are not as top levels as they should be here. Thus, 3 instead off a regular 4 or 5. But the prices are as high.
The place is pretty noisy as well, probably because it is in the basement with a low ceiling."}
{"text":"Not bad but kinda over rated. The ambiance and food were nice but a bit too pricey. The waiter was very bougeiose and snobby didn't really care for that. Time to get food and wait was a little longer than I hoped. I would definitely come back for happy hour but might try another steak house next time for dinner."}
{"text":"I think I have been to every Ruth's Chris Steak house in any major city in the US and I have never had such a bad experience, it felt like we stumbled into Sizzler (not that I have been there but assume this is the quality you get for the price there).

The entrance is trashy as coming from downstairs of a dirty casino, the patrons from that very casino come upstairs and use the bathrooms, I felt like \"midnight with working girls in the bathrooms\", the guests have wife-beater shirts on with basketball shorts, a four top of very loud and obnoxious people was escorted out after arguing and yelling curse words, the service was poor by best and the steak after third time still not cooked correctly. Menus are so old and worn, I took couple of pictures, again, how can you present something like this in this type of establishment is beyond me. The manager was the biggest joke, as to him crediting the bill was his solution and he had no intention of listening what is really wrong and how he can improve his restaurant/team by our feedback. It seemed he disliked being there as much as we did.

Needless to say I am surprised that corporate has their name on this very particular site as it is an embarrassment to Ruth's Chris name/legacy."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary here.  We eat out quite a bit, and we've tried all the major steakhouses, Morton's, Fleming's, you bane it. We usually wind up back at Ruth's.  Our server, Shanese, was excellent, new to Phoenix.  She was very friendly, didn't interrupt our conversation, and really knew her wines.  The steaks, as always, were excellent, perfectly cooked. The creme brulee was the best.  Great ambience, fun time."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday. Upon arrival the table was decorated with birthday confetti and a cute card from the restaurant. The attention they paid to all of us was amazing but especially checking in with him. We had so many servers taking care of us but Jeffrey was our main server and was so sweet and accommodating as we tried to make up our minds on appetizers. We went with the seafood tower and it did not disappoint! Cocktail were great, love the cane sugar rim! I ordered the petite filet while my bf order the 11oz, mine was as big as his. Huge!!! He's happy he got to finish mine! The sides we ordered we great for 2 people to share. We should have ordered more au gratin potatoes we all wanted more. They waited until everyone was completely finished to box up extras and move to dessert orders. They brought my boyfriend a beautiful dessert, he said the chocolate was the best he's ever had and a second one to take home!! What an amazing birthday experience. Our whole table was satisfied with the food and experience! Definitely a perfect place to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Came for my birthday and likely WILL NOT return. No complaints with service, but the food wasn't great... Decor really sucked too, didn't have much of an $100+ per person ambiance. The biggest disappointment was the sides. Not really sure how an upscale restaurant can mess something up as easy as MASHED POTATOES, but it tasted like it came out of an expired cardboard box. The lobster mac and cheese tasted just okay, nothing special. The ribeye steak was decent, probably the best thing there, but definitely over priced. The chicken was average at most, shrimp dishes was just okay... Found everything to be surprisingly bland and unflavourful. On the plus side, they were very accommodating with waiting on guests to arrive later than reservations time, plus the little birthday cheesecake was cute and yum. 
Tip: Just go to The Keg for better food and value lol"}
{"text":"We (4 people) went there a couple weeks ago and each of us ordered different items off the menu and we all agreed all of the food was excellent and prepared to perfection.  The calamari appetizer was especially great. Another side dish you should try if you like sweet potatoes is their mashed sweet potatoes with a pecan crust, it is so indescribably delicious!  The only reason for a four star rating is because we all thought it was way too dark in there. I can understand an expensive restaurant wanting a delightful ambiance, but it was so hard to even read the menu because of the darkness.  In fact, we saw an older man using a little flashlight to try and read his menu. That is the only negative comment I have on this restaurant,  The prices are really high, but we expected that from this place."}
{"text":"Joe Veniegas is the best waiter/server I've ever had in my life. He check on us multiple times and made sure we were ok with everything. Never had to flag him down for anything. I definitely will be coming back here. And will ask for Joe by name. We live in Los Angeles and have gone to so many places but Joe went above and beyond and for that I will be coming back..."}
{"text":"I'd eagerly awaited eating here as I've heard good reviews from others.  The plates heated to 500 degrees is a gimmick that didn't impress me at all.  I think the bottom line is I like my steaks grilled, not broiled.  The sides (creamed spinach and mashed potatoes) were no better than what I make at home.  

As for the atmosphere, it's a huge room and we had a nice view of the Strip.  The lighting was a bit too dim.  Nice staff.  We ordered wine and they brought us a 2006, not the 2010 we'd ordered.  Looked at the wine list again and ordered another bottle which they didn't have.  This restaurant had only been opened 3 or 4 weeks, and the wine list didn't reflect what they had in their cellar.

I wouldn't go to any Ruth's Chris again, it's not bad, it's just not the style of cooking that I prefer."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving was an extreme disappointment (to put it very mildly and try to be fair). Their Thanksgiving three course meal would have been a great price for $39.95, however the food was not hot, the turkey, side dishes and dessert were very average, they crowded the restaurant with additional seating and couldn't serve everyone properly. Apparently the food was just sitting at the pass waiting for the wait staff, because each of our courses took a VERY long time to be served, and when we did get it, everything was barely warm. We actually spoke up, for my mother, and asked them to bring her a new side dish of mashed potatoes, because she described them as cold. After a VERY long wait again, the new casserole of potatoes were the same temperature as before (and as all of ours). If I had been at home, I never would have eaten any of the food this cold. The dessert was described as \"Pumpkin Cheesecake,\" however it was a \"cafeteria-like\" mixture somewhat like a pumpkin mousse (however that term is too generous), with pecans mixed into the mash, (no crust), that tasted very mass produced. What was even more of a sign of their substandard attention was that we waited 20\" after they had cleared our dinner plates, before they brought the round scoops (\"cheesecakes\") -- some of which had whipped cream (nickle-size dollops) on top and some that didn't. By that time, it really felt like we had gone to a cheap smorgasborg. A couple of my other family members had chosen a different 3 course menu option: squash soup, filet mignon, a side, and apple crumb pie (for $59.95). Of course, their soups and sides were cold as well, and the \"apple crumb pie\" was also just a blob of similar unidentifiable mash that contained diced apple chunks and some apple crumb. (The two desserts were actually so indistinguishable that they were served to the wrong people, and no one could even tell.) It is unfortunate how a very disappointing family holiday dinner experience can ruin our opinion of their reputation. We had always enjoyed dining at Ruth's Chris and felt that they were a fine alternative to Capital Grill, Fleming's, Mastro's, or Dominick's (with different pros & cons). We have spent two or three anniversaries at Ruth's Chris, and they made them special with the sprinkled table decorations, rose, and photo. However, after spending $551.78 (wine, drinks, tip incl.), for this last experience which was DEFINITELY NOT worth the price, I don't believe that we will ever return, especially since there are so many other wonderful alternatives for fine steak, special sides, excellent service and much better ambiance."}
{"text":"This was amazing! The filet is so good it's just to dye for. Service is is the best. Food is delicious. It's a second time me and my husband celebrate my birthday here. I would recommend it for special occasions ( it's a little bit pricey) but it worth every penny! That first bite of my steak thats was A heaven. And chocolate on desert it was something, I loved it!"}
{"text":"I don't typically like to go to chain restaurants especially when it's a nice restaurant, but it's hard to stay away from the Ruth Chris. The service is always great, we're always sat when we make a reservation, the food is delicious and we always have a great time. Once we sat a photographer came around to take a photo, we opted not to buy the photo but thought it was a fun experience. We all order steaks and they were cooked to perfection. I've been to a couple Ruth Chris's now and I've always enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the view was great and our waitress, Dollianne was phenomenal! Her wine suggestion was great and we loved the service!!"}
{"text":"Great food, we like all Ruth Chris restaurants, in Woodland Hills, Pasadena ( exceptional ambiance ), Las Vegas, Phoenix, they are all very good."}
{"text":"I have been to many Ruth Chris Steakhouses and they are always delicious and a treat.  We recently visited the Ruth Chris Steakhouse in Las Vegas in the Harrahs Casino.  The manager there, a large african amercian, sorry I don't know his name, when asked he said \"Bill Cosby\", was the most rudest incompetent manager I have ever seen!  We had a issue with the bill and when he came to our table he was rude, sloppy, and pretty much said \"if you don't like it, get out!\"  I was shocked!!  I called corporate and they said they have no control over them as they are a franchise.  He doesn't deserve to be a manager, he has no people skills and is as I said, very incompetent.  I am very disapointed with the powers that be there at that restaurant that they allow such a man to be a manager at their restaurant.  If he was like this with me I am sure he is with others, so hopefully they will see the truth about this man."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of good steak accompanied by good service. As a San Diego resident the service and food at Ruth Chris San Diego is amazing-sadly it was not the case for my Vegas experience. We went a couple of weeks ago for my BF's birthday and I made an online reservation indicating the special occasion. We got there a little late and it took about 5 minutes for us to get seated which we were okay with. Our server seem to be attentive at the beginning but as time progressed we were totally abandoned-he only came to check on us about two-three times after our food was served. We couldn't make up our mind with the drinks and maybe that's what got him frustrated so he decided to go take care of his other tables and forget about us. We ordered the three course meal and while we were still eating our salad the steaks and sides came out which rushed me to finish my salad and my boyfriend had to ask the busser or whoever he was (it wasn't even the waiter) to take the food back, he was not going to rush his salad just because they decided to bombard us with all the food. The steak was alright I guess, somewhat salty but the sides were horrible. I ordered the sautéed mushrooms and creamed spinach, the spinach looked like it was the left over of the day with some butter added and the mushroom consistency was like they weren't sautéed but rather taken out of a bag and just tossed in microwaved melted butter. My point is-the sides tasted like we go the leftovers of the day and maybe we did since we go there at 9 and they close at 10:30. We truly felt rushed throughout our dinner and if you are going to be rushing people then don't take late dinner reservations. I like to be constantly checked on the service needs especially when we are paying for a $200 dinner. He didn't even get a birthday cake like they normally do in SD. If you are going to Vegas and spending that much money on steak I would suggest trying another steakhouse instead-Ruth's Chris service is definitely not the same everywhere."}
{"text":"Went for the first time a couple weeks ago for a friends birthday. Service was great, atmosphere definitely felt more higher class and proper. I was prepared for the steep prices, our steaks were perfectly cooked. Party of 7 and between all of us (all guys) we shared all the sides (5 sides were ordered). 3 appies. 

Corking fee was VERY expensive for our bottle of Dom at $35-$40 can't really remember. 

All in all we were all very happy with our food and service. Just be prepared to pay out of your a$$"}
{"text":"Ate here the other night with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and it was delish. Had complementary valet. Such good food! Had NY strip, potatoes, and dessert. The only reason it wasn't perfect was the valet getting the car back to us when we were done eating. We waited about 15-20 mins for that in the cold weather. Will be coming back for food and drinks though!"}
{"text":"the place was nice, the service was great from our server.  The part I was most dissatified with is that we ordered an appetizer, salad, sides, steaks and crab legs.   It was delicious until the frozen crab legs came out.  Three pieces for like 50.00 REALLY?  I ordered my steak med rare and when it sizzled on the plate it was medium almost well.  Just pink.  I still enjoyed the taste and we went on a business dinner, but I had to pay for it I think that I would be upset with the crab legs and the steak.
Let's clarify this, I mentioned it to the Donald Bishop the general manager when he casually came by and ask us how everything was.  I told him it was great except for the crab legs he asked why and I told him, based on that I thought he would give us a dessert (even though we couldn't eat another bite).  Instead he thank us for the feed back.  I didn't say it for something it was the truth, but for him to not even just comp it because it was still on the table.  I think for a place like that he could have done somthing about this.  If I am wrong please let me know.  I am a business owner myself and I know customer service is everything.  This was not really customer service to me.
He just gave me his card and said to call him for our next visit.  Really what does that mean?  I took a coworker her because she has never been, well I doubt we will be ever back.  Or we have to know we order STEAK not seafood."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day after dinner.  We were 10 minutes late for our reservation at 630 called to let them know we were late.  Upon arrival at 642 we we're promptly seated.  

James goes by Jim was excellent in his service to our table, very pleasant and informative.  Not overbearing or to talkative.  We never had to wait on drink refills or anything for that matter.  Restaurant was busy but not packed.  

T-bone steak I ordered was a tad over cooked, I hated to even say anything, but as I only come once or twice a year I wanted it perfect.  It was handled perfectly, another steak was put in to cook in the process of manager making it to the table to apologize.  The next steak was perfect exactly as ordered.  My wife had the cowboy ribeye and it was cooked to perfection as well. 

We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon, potatoes au gratin, sweet potato soufflé for sides.  All were excellent. 

2 deserts were comped by the manager, we boxed to take home and I am sure will be just as great.  

5 stars, even though first steak was not perfect, the way it was handled was.  

My wife had a great time, enjoyed a terrific meal and outing.  

Thank you for being great at what you do, from management down to Maya who prepared our leftovers to take home.   She was just as pleasant and gave us new ideas for desert. 

Awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great mini-moon dinner here. Located one floor up from the Harrah's casino area is where this RC is at. very elegant space overlooking the Strip. the restaurant itself is also wide open with and inner and outer area. our server was just an awesome dude. very helpful, even after we told him this was our 5th RC visit. explained the hot oven and hot plate thing. 

old habits die hard so we stuck with our favorite starter the beefsteak tomato/onion and arugala salad. that one may have just have been the best one we've had at any of their locations. mama got the stuffed chicken and got the cowboy ribeye. both were absolutely delicious. they even got us a flourless chocolate cake for our mini-moon. very cool.

great place and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The lobster mac and cheese! Words can't even explain the taste of it. It came out on a hot dish. With the lobster in the middle. I can still hear the dish sizzle. Lots of taste that melts in your mouth. A bit of chili in it, but it was a good touch.

More on the expensive side for food, but for a special occasion it isn't so bad. The combination meal that comes with your choice of an entree, soup or salad, a side and dessert was the best deal. $50-60

Our server seemed like she was busy, she took our order and wasn't really friendly.. she was very short and then she was gone. She boxed up my dessert, dropped it off and took off without even saying thank you.

Service was 2-3 stars and food was 4 stars."}
{"text":"Overall, I have no complaints. My girlfriend and I celebrated our 1 year here and from I chose this place because of recommendations from my friends. I have heard nothing but good things about this restaurent. 
From Opentable reserving, to excellent service, complimentary picture (For special occaisions only), and OUTSTANDING food, our entire dinner was wonderful.  We both had the Ribeye 12 ounce steak which by the way was the BEST Ribeye I have ever had. Mashed potatoes which complimented our entree and a few glasses of red wine. Excellent selection and will definitely keep this place in mind for another special occasion."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot put this review on open table because I did not make a reservation. However I went last Friday for lunch. The food was outstanding and the service even better. The ribeye was perfectly cooked and our server , Erin, was engaging , professional and attentive. I look forward to checking out their dinner menu in the not so distant future."}
{"text":"Great food good service crazy price. We loved it. Todd was our server and he was very nice and patient with us. He brought us drinks out on the smoking back. They didn't rush us. They open the door for us every time we went out in and out. We loved it! It was our anniversary dinner and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and had a different level of experience each time. First, we went on a quiet Tuesday night and the food and service were good, valet was quick. Then we went back when there was a soccer game over at the Panthers stadium. Big mistake. The valet parks cars in the same deck that sells parking for events at the stadium. We gave up and got our own car so we at least had somewhere to sit because he said it would be more than an hour. We gave it another try during restaurant week. Another mistake. The food and service suffered. I felt like everyone in there assumed we couldn't afford to eat here at regular prices. Basically, go when it is not restaurant week and make sure you aren't valeting your car into an event disaster."}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST steakhouse i have ever been to.  I have seen a lot of good reviews about Ruth's Chris, and when i heard we having dinner there i was pretty excited.  When we got there for our 8pm reservation, we were promptly shown to our table.  The restaurant has an intimate and old school feel to it. Felt like i was a in a Godfather movie lol.  But joking aside the service was exceptional, our server was knowledgable and accomadating.  We felt very welcomed.  We started of with a couple of cocktails and blue crab cakes which were divine.  Then for our main we got the porterhouse steak for two and scalloped potatoes for our side.  And for dessert we had creme brulee and cappucino.

Old fashioned cocktail: very good cocktail, well rounded with perfect amount of good quality alcohol

Blue crab cakes: best crab cakes, you can actually taste the crab meat and not bread crumbs or other fillers that other places use.

Porterhouse steak: the BEST steak ive ever had.  Big piece of steak, it couldve have served atleast three ppl.  Grilled perfect, medium rare, just melted in my mouth (i can still remember that moment as im writting this review). Good marbling and flavourful, each bite was just a like piece of heaven.

Scallped potatoes: good side, flavourful, good size portion.

Creme Brulee: perfect crust on top, velvety smooth custard. A perfect end to a marvelous night.

I cant say how much i loved dining at Ruth's Chris steakhouse.  Even though the night was a very expensive event, the experience and food was well worth it.  Service was on point and the food just devine."}
{"text":"This restaurant has truly outstanding steak. It is by far my favorite steak establishment in Ontario. The atmosphere is formal but not stuffy. The service is always impeccable, and the stakes are fabulous. The sides - dishes, although pretty basic andunimagenative (eg fries...)  are also very good. Be forewarned though, the meals are truly huge. I believe that their standard is a 16oz steak for dinner meals. I would recommend getting one of their smaller steaks or splitting a larger one for a more regular sized meal. Their sides are also pretty large. With an appetizer, a steak, and a side, you'll definitely have either a second meal to take home, or dinner for two."}
{"text":"Want to pay too much for a mediocre meal? Then have you found the right place. 

I love a good steakhouse but this place misses the mark, first off they can't make a decent martini, secondly for the price their cuts of meat are Outback Steakhouse worthy. Lastly they nickel and dime you for everything. Very disappointed. I've given them three chances (foolish me). 

If you want to spend money and have a great steak check out Delmonico's in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"We made early reservations,  The food was good, but the service was rushed, and awful. my daughter and I  (she is 10)  spent over 100 bucks and they did  comp our desert, because I got a pebble / tiny bone that luckily only bruised my tooth, I hated the manager's attitude  of \"that has never happened in all the years I have been working here, which put me off my appetite but I said  I 'm afraid to eat it so I'll take it to go,  it actually hurt for about a day and a half. anyhow I like to pay extra for good service which you can't get here. So this week we got a one lb ribeye at AJ's for 19.99 a lb  andi made it at home, and it was the quality of meat Ruch chris charged me over 50 bucks for  no  service, and no presentation with the food. I might go back for the lobster mac and cheese. glad I ordered that.  but  that is the only good thing I can say about this place.  how hard is it not to pounce on  an old lady and a kid  in an empty restaurant   Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Ruth's Chris Steak house since 1990's. I was regular at the Palm Desert, then Woodland Hills and Phoenix area. Las Vegas location is hard to get in and out, so it took me 6 years to finally find it.  As expected quality is consistent, corn fed beef are brilliant, service is prompt and professional. I was however somewhat disappointed by the wine list. I hope they have a greater and larger selection of wine.  It is a tragedy when you eat such a juicy steak with average wine.  I hope my next visit I get to see more extensive wine list. If you have not been to This Steak House I suggest you find one close to you and try."}
{"text":"I was some time ago that I went here, but im sure one thing hasn't changed about this restaurant - overpriced food items! 

I went here for a friends birthday, my friend's family was family friends with the head chef so he ordered in Halal Steaks for her birthday event here. We had a private dining area with about 20 or so people. 

I enjoy steak, I like having it once in a while, but for $50 for just a piece of meat - no sides! Umm over priced much!! So I got a drink and a side for about $12 for mash potatoes.... i mean, yes it was good, but for the price it was ok. I've had just as good steak and mash at another restaurant for a fraction of what this cost me.

Although a nice ambiance, and central location, from what I remember service was friendly too. But unless its a special occassion I probably won't be seen here much.

2 stars is based on the unexpected high price - for a \"ok\" meal without dessert. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Very good for lunch... Even when is not the best steak house in Calgary is not bad... The service is good too.. The beef was very tasty and the vegetables were very well prepared as well.. I would go back there..."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Ruth's Chris! We came here for the first time on our anniversary and the service we received was absolutely top notch. From the little anniversary confetti on the table to the dessert plate which had Happy 4th Anniversary written on it everything was fabulous. I highly recommend. Their steaks really do melt in your mouth. Yes, it is pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - prime steaks, great sides, awesome cocktails - great service! 
Will be back again and again and again"}
{"text":"Went tonight with my boyfriend for his birthday. Our server, Brock, was super attentive and knowledgeable. Loved him!! We had a wonderfully delicious meal, including gumbo , Caesar salad, steaks, potatoes, and cheesecake for dessert. Yum! We even had the raspberry and rosemary cosmos. I am not a lover of cosmos, but this may be the most perfectly blended drink I ever had. I had one the only other time I went to Ruth's Chris in Detroit, and it was as good as I remembered. My boyfriend, who is quick to let you know if he found shortcomings in a restaurant, had only positive things to say. Thank you for living up to my expectations and impressing my man!! He had never been, and he did not even squawk at the bill.....always a plus"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steak House - Fancy restaurant with a fancy price. My formal dinner took place here this time around in Vegas. Restaurant had lighting that was dim but attractive, set a great mood for the evening. 

Staff was very polite and professional, we were greeted by a server and his assistant - I just want to begin by saying our server was shown up his assistant. My party was not given bad service but all the service we received was from the assistant. 

Paying 20% on a $480 bill is roughly $100. I need my waiter/server to earn that kind of money. 
In the future I hope wait staff, like Johnny, are more attentive and concerned with paying customers. 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Best stuffed chicken I've had in my life. Steak was excellent too. We ordered mashed potatoes and asparagus for our sides-absolutely delicious. Our server was Cesar, he was wonderful. Our busser was great too I wish I remembered his name. All around great experience. Yes, it is pretty pricey but if you feel like splurging, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was in town for business, hungry as hell after traveling in from the East Coast and on my own for dinner so a walk to dine at the Ruth's Chris bar seemed like a really good idea.  It was.  The RC chain typically does a nice, consistent job no matter the city you're in and the Scottsdale version was no exception.

The 5 stars started with Kaylee the awesome bartender - shout out to Shelby, NC - ;-)  She was personable, on top of everything and clearly had a great relationship with all the servers, bussers, etc. in the place.  A true pro. 

I ordered a cup of lobster bisque which was delish and featured a nice quantity of lobster meat.  Next came a Caesar salad and the anchovies offered as an addition gave a nice salty punch to the already outstanding dressing.  Finally, a perfectly medium-rare, thick and juicy NY Strip served on one of those signature sizzling RC plates.   

Return visit on another trip to Scottsdale?  No hesitation."}
{"text":"In Vegas with my wife and two young daughters with $100 gift certificate from Hilton--Gordon Ramsey or Ruth Chris?  My wife was pushing for Ramsey and I wanted to go with reliability.  But it's in Harrahs and you have to walk through the smokey casino to get there.  But what a relief to come off the elevator to what tends to be a Ruth Chris unaffected by Vegas!  Beautifully (minute signs of wear) appointed circular restaurant. We were seated by the window with a view of the strip. Jeff our waiter was friendly and attentive. Just enough small talk to make us feel welcomed.  And finally the food; both bone in steaks delicious--all fresh sides and to the Ruth Chris standards expected."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this Ruth Chris location, but they didn't disappoint. The food and the service was amazing. I order T-Bone steak with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The steak came out sizzling hot and was huge! My guest order chicken and it was delicious. Actually Better than my steak, and my steak was good. Our server was attentive, and fast. I wish every restaurant operated like this. We left completely satisfied. I would definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"The food had good flavor. As, my fliet was overcooked. However, the service was absolutely terrible. 
I will not come to this location again."}
{"text":"So this Ruth's Chris is located in a little plaza.  I've been to the Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills and Woodland Hills location, and man...this one in Vegas was dark, cramped and very old looking.  YES, the steak and sides were perfect as usual, but I can't get over how little this spot was.  The service wasn't as great.  We had to ask for this, that or the other.  Whereas the other locations, service has been top notch."}
{"text":"When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.

It's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the façade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.

The waitress was friendly, but gave the \"welcome to Ruth's Chris\" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.

I ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  

Shortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.

After finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  

I am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is supposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.  Other times I've visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   

I will return, but just not to this location."}
{"text":"Very delicious, Always satisfied with Ruth's Chris quality and service, still the beast steak I've had from the many places I've been to. The lobster Mac and cheese and the sweet potato casserole is to die for! Food comes out sizzling be careful not to burn yourself on the plate! I would recommend this Steak house to anyone!"}
{"text":"Celebrated wife's birthday here last night, for a quick dinner before catching a show downtown.

I've been to Ruth's Chris steak house in the states, but never visited this location in Toronto.

Reservation was easy, called on my way and our table was ready when we arrived after 30/45 minutes.
Parking is a little challenging, just like anywhere in Downtown, but there are several underground structures that connects through the building.

Ruth Chris's is a high-end steakhouse, great for business meetings, dates, special occasions and casual dinners.
The steak is one of the best in the city, I can't remember any other steakhouse that beats this quality.
The steaks were ordered Medium-Rare, and it couldn't be done any better! Rich in flavour, sizzling in garlic butter sauce, it makes you crave for more!

Service is on point & professional, while the place was very busy, servers kept everything under control and everything arrived on a timely manner.

As a birthday gift, the restaurant brought us a nice piece of Chocolate moose cake labeled 'Happy Birthday'!

this would be a favourite new spot whenever i'm in the city."}
{"text":"Went here to have a romantic dinner. Waiter was rushing us to order. People seated after us were already served drinks and bread long before ours came. Onion soup was good, NY Strip good, filet was just OK. The au gratin was fabulous and the asparagus tasted like they cooked it last week. We had to ask for more drinks. When a place cost as much as this one the food and service should be outstanding. Personally I prefer food at Outback. I have to say this place SUCKS. Also had to pay some old guy who called himself valet to move a cone so we could self park. Parking is bad in this center.Carpet is old and dirty. People at the front desk chomping gum. The whole place just lackluster. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My stars are for the great service. Friendly server and the restaurant manager came by to check on us even though nothing was amiss. The appetizers and sides were also delicious.

However, I'd say that the steak itself was subpar. Took my mother and younger brother. The filet mignon that my mother got was good, but the ribeye and ny strip that my brother and I got were  not worth it. They were both drowned in a lake of butter. Way, way too much butter. Especially for the ribeye, which is already a very well marbled cut if meat. Just made it too fatty and oily to enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Ruth's Chris tonight for a special occasion tonight . we were not very impressed with the overall experience. For a Monday night , they were not very busy. They only had about 6 tables in the dining room and a party of almost 20 people in the banquet room . Service was good . The waiter was nice yet I want to mention the manager who passed  by our table at least four times without stopping to ask about the food or the service.
Food was average . We started with the shrimp
Cocktail which was the best part of the whole meal. The wedge salad after that was fresh. However when it came to the entrees , my husband's lobster was cold . My salmon was average . As far as the side orders, the asparagus was over grilled and there wasn't anything special about the potato au gratin. 
We have dined at the other Ruth in the South Park location and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"In my opinion, for the price, make it at home. Food was average at best. I can't believe I was so excited to eat here. I wonder if the food is better at other locations."}
{"text":"Took my husband last night for his birthday steaks were cooked to perfection! We had the crab cakes for appetizer and they were so tender and moist I can't describe in words. I would have given 5 stars but the scallop and lobster that came with my filet were a little over cooked."}
{"text":"ok. lets get it straight, check my record, i am a habitual 5 star giver. in this case though, Ruth chris' gets a pathetic 1, and here is why. 

1)The Steak: Ya it was an ok piece of meat, sure it would have cost me $20 bucks at cumbraes, but here is the difference, they didnt season the damn thing at all, they just baisted it in a stupid amount of butter
2) the bread: listen, i like bread, and if im paying 100+ for dinner, i better damn well get some warm fresh bread, not cold bread, wtf.

Basically, too much damn butter served here, and i literally stayed awake in agony shvitzing butter for the remainder of the night, unable to move. Was the meat good? ya it was ok, but i had to salt the damn thing 25 times and it came with absolutely no unbelievable flavor. Ceasar salad was horrid, literally horrid, and well what else can i say, the server was nice and the beer was cold. I should have known not go but but had a $100 gift certificate that i didnt want to regift. 

If your looking for perfect steak in a steak house environment id reccomend Tom Jones' steakhouse, place for steak, barbaryans or Hy's, they are all much much better then this joint."}
{"text":"ALWAYS AMAZING! Everything here is a-la-cart. They used to have a prix fixe option on the menu, but they got rid of it. I wish they'd bring it back, it was such a deal and made ordering a breeze.

Their steak - you have to start there - is literally mouth-watering. Seriously, it's spectacular. The filet is to die for (TIP: Get it LESS done than you normally like. It will keep cooking on your plate).

The calamari is outstanding!  Their creamed spinach is my favorite side. We go here many times a year (even brought employees here for holiday dinner) and always leave very happy! 

They also have happy hour with this great lemonade-like cocktail with blueberries. Their Happy Hour food options (sliders!) are great too.

The desert has never been that good to me (and I love deserts), but everything else is perfection! You're so full at the end it doesn't matter anyway."}
{"text":"FINALLY made it byt to peep out Ruth's Chris!!  It was game night (and it was super packed)  but we were able to catch a bar table right away which didn't bother us since we wanted to be able to see the game as well. Nice bar area, great service , awesome menu and delicious food or and strong tasty drinks ...

I don't normally eat red meat but i made exception and had a bite of bf's (didn't help it had toasted blue cheese crumbs on it) and it was a orgasm in my mouth. You love steak? You will love Ruth's Chris. i tried a stuffed chicken that was cooked perfectly. the sides you choose are def large enough to share so we tried a few and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"I love the presentation of this place! It really set the mood! 

Our server, I believe her name is Lina was amazing. She let me pick special steak knives of my own choice like I was some undercover ninja. Woo! 

The food was juicy. The steak came out sizzling on this hot plate with a butter base. I love butter. It was also cooked perfectly. I felt like the steak dissolved in my mouth. Yummmmm

I also got this chocolate duo cake to go so I haven't eaten it yet but I'm sure it tastes good. 

Thank you for making my night!!!"}
{"text":"Steak was trash, I couldn't believe it, my first time there and my steak was barley edible crispy burnt, maybe I'll give it another chance one day but man o man.....are server Dominick was cool though"}
{"text":"My steak was soooooo tender! Couldn't have been any better! The sides were great as well."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris, why does your food have to be so average and underwhelming

The restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice out

If you go ask for Bruce, he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end places

Having not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot, i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak, which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly, I feel their steaks are bland, especially compared to other chains like Masteros

The desserts were very good and the highlight for us, both the sin cake (very dark chocolatey) and the bread pudding with raisens

Won't be going back, however the location and the service are fantastic, so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks, you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time, as we did, even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation"}
{"text":"We went for my birthday and intended to spend a great deal of money and enjoy ourselves. We went with another couple and really had a nice evening with good friends and great food.  There were a few times I had to ask for a refill on my water and twice asked for more bread. I did not like that our steaks came out on sizzling plates but due to the service staff not knowing which plate went where, the plates were no longer sizzling when it got to us. The plates were still hot but not sizzling to give that effect.  The part that really was disappointing with me was they overcharged us and added a lobster tail to our bill when I did not order it - and did not receive it. The strange part, the waitress asked me if I was suppose to have a lobster tail and I told her no, so you would've thought she would make sure our bill was accurate. We were with friends and chatting, so when the bill came, we paid it without going over the itemized bill. You just assume the bill will be accurate but that is our error. I called the restaurant and the manager apologized and credited back the lobster tail. She then offers to send a gift card for the inconvenience. I just think at a high end restaurant, accurate billing is a must."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris is known for their steaks, great steaks.  They are pretty good, but I've had better.  Adding butter to the steak doesn't make it better, when you have a truly great steak, it doesn't need that to hide behind.  I find that it makes their steaks too rich, not from the meat, but from all the  BUTTER.  I'm not a fan. 
The service is excellent (5 star), and the sides were better than average.
Prices are higher than most, but not justified in my opinion."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with dining at Ruth's Chris! I was already a fan of this restaurant chain but wanted to dine at their Scottsdale location to see what it was like.. This restaurant is located upstairs in a mid-sized plaza.. The decor and ambiance are great but there isn't an amazing view like you would find at other Ruth's Chris'.. The wait staff are extremely friendly and the service was top quality.. I had their maryland blue crab cake appetizer, an apple martini, and their porterhouse for two entree.. Everything tasted amazing and I wouldn't have ordered anything else.. My only critique is that we ordered the porterhouse medium rare and the larger pieces were completely rare in the middle.. Luckily they serve their meat on sizzling hot plates so I was able to cook my meat a bit more.. The drinks here are served very strong so if you're not a big fan of that then I suggest asking them to tone it down a bit.. I didn't order anything for dessert because nothing on the menu appealed to me but I enjoyed what I did eat.. If you're looking for a special place to take someone out on a date then I recommend Ruth's Chris!"}
{"text":"One of my business partners came to town and suggested that we get a steak for dinner. 
He went ahead and made a ressie for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and since he was buying, he got to choose. 
We walked in on time for our 7:00 pm reservation to be told that they weren't ready for us yet...in a half empty restaurant. 
I was puzzled, but it seemed to be a ploy, more than anything else, to get us into the bar for a cocktail, before we went into the restaurant for...a cocktail.
The service was, in a single well chosen word...perfunctory. 
Our waiter went through the motions and didn't seem particularly pleased with Ruthies or with us. None of the staff seemed up and happy. Nobody was really smiling or friendly, and every phrase, every question, every move seemed designed to \"optimize\" us. Every word sounded like it came out of the corporate server manual.
The food was OK. If you put enough butter on anything, you can make it taste pretty good, and they put some  butter on them there steaks, let me tell you! 
The wine list is fine...I don't have the palate for fine pinot's that my partner does, but he found something from Oregon that he liked and you can't really screw up MacCallan's, neat:)
After the initial enforced 20 minute wait for nothing, we were assembly lined through dinner in an hour. How very efficient! :)
If it seems that I am being tough on Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, it's only because I am. 
You know, when I spend (OK, I didn't spend a dime, dinner was on my partner and believe me when I tell you I deserved to be treated to a free dinner) $250 for 2 people, I want to see the love from everybody in the place, from the minute I walk in the door, through bringing the ice water and the MacCallan's, to perfection in the art of appetizer's, entrée's, desserts and coffee. 
I see the love in other places (both considerably more expensive and significantly less expensive, so it's not a case of me just being crabby about pricey dinner spots:), and it just doesn't come shining through here.
I just don't get that anybody really gives a crap at Ruthies'. I'm probably wrong, and everybody cares about us, \"the valued customer\", like the very dickens. 
As far as Ruthie's being a chain, so we should expect the corporate approach, well...I see chains where the service is caring and enthusiastic, even if they are serving double-doubles and a coke for $5.45, not steak and scotch for $100+ per, and the fresh faces smiling at me aren't making a $50 tip on my dinner, either. So I know it can be done...and should be done:)
BTW, clear up the confusion for me...I know who \"Ruth\" is, but who or what is her \"Chris\"?"}
{"text":"Came here for my husbands birthday and wow what a place ! Good food and such a good waitress. So young I think was her name and thanks to her we had a special dinner . Closed at 10 and we stayed till almost 11 . The filet mignon was to die for as the lobster mac and cheese. Asparagus and mash potatoes were also very tasty . 3 course dinner is a must here . 300$ for for people very worth it . Had a great view as well facing ceasers palace ."}
{"text":"I have been to Ruth's Chris about 5 times. This is my first visit to this property. The service was ok. We ordered the ribeye with shrimp, lobster tail, steamed crab legs, mushrooms, and au gratin potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly, the shrimp was over cooked, the lobster was seasoned well and cooked well, the king crab legs were good until the air conditioning turned it cold, the mushrooms weren't that good, and the au gratin potatoes were great. Would not recommend getting shrimp added to the meal. I should have ordered the barbecue shrimp instead."}
{"text":"Could be better,  must be the area,  overcooked ribeye.  Filet was great.  Chose not to order anything more"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here and we got here by ways of Infiniti. We were getting the oil changed on my husband's car (or something else equally mundane) and a salesman kept trying to get us to test drive a new car but we had no interest. He finally sweetened the deal with a Ruth's Chris gift card. Long story short, we drove the car, got the gift card, got our car back and went to dinner. 

We got there and sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and scotch before we moved to our seats. I've got to say, this is the only location I've been so I can't speak for the ambiance of others, but this one is sorely lacking. The lighting is bright, it feels overly open and the air conditioner was blowing full force. 

We started with the wedge with blue cheese. It was as expected. Iceberg with bacon and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Tastes good. I don't remember was cut if steak we ordered but I was talked into getting the butter on my plate. Huge mistake. It just made it overly rich. I also can't say I'm a fan of the searing hot plate. It made my medium rare steak progressively more cooked. If it has to go in either direction, I prefer it to be rarer. My husband wanted the au gratin potatoes so we shared an order of those. Here's another one of my beef's. Sometimes restaurants equate richness (butter and cream) with flavor and goodness, which they are, but they stop there. They load up the potatoes au gratin with sticks of butter and pints and heavy whipping cream and think, \"Viola! I have created a masterpiece!\" but in reality they're just rich and really don't have much flavor. You can probably tell I didn't think much of them. 

For desert we ended up with the chocolate sin cake and the creme brulee. Both were OK but so are the frozen deserts from Trader Joe's. I'd say they were on par with those. OK when I'm paying $4.99 for two and preparing them myself. Not so much when buying one in a restaurant. 

Nothing was bad at Ruth's Chris, I was disappointed to find that nothing stood out as phenomenal. Next time I'll stay home and make some steaks myself, we'll eat them in our pajamas with a bottle of wine them watch some Mad Men. Now that's a good evening."}
{"text":"Our usual go to when in Vegas! Definitely a great deal when using our TR rewards credit, and a never disappointing meal. Steaks are on point and the sides are always deliciously well made. 
Service is very quick, however, some waiters are a bit curt and could use a friendlier tone with customers. 
Otherwise, making reservations is easy and the space is beautiful!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because its near my apartment and its open until 3am every night!  Forget the appetizers and sides..none of them are exceptional.  Just get 2 petitte filets rare with no butter and save room for the bananas foster for $30....a pretty pimp dessert indeed."}
{"text":"Best steak you can get at 2:30am!!  I prefer my filet rare with no butter.

The berries or bananas foster is an interesting splurge for $30 too."}
{"text":"I am not a big steak person but when im craving steak i always crave ruths. and my favorite thing is their caesar salad haha. I tried the house wine (red) for the first time, surprisingly it was great plus i think my server poured me a 9 oz vs 6 oz hehe. sad thing was elevator on richmond st wasnt working so had to walk through the hotel or conventional hall i dont know what it was and take escalator and loop around it was a hassle. it was also all stars weekend so it was more busy than usual. almost all the tables were filled and it was day before valentines day too."}
{"text":"There are lots of places to eat in Charlotte, and this is one of the best!!  I had the Summer menu tonight which was fantastic!  A strawberry and toasted almond with bleu cheese crumble salad, filet with lobster tail, and cheesecake for dessert.  My only somewhat disappointing moment was when they brought out the mashed potatoes. They were the consistency of instant mashed potatoes from flakes.  I prefer the mashed potatoes have chunks of potatoes in them. They chef quickly replaced them with chipotle fingerling potatoes and they were awesome!!!!   Valet parking was a breeze, the service was top notch and the food was phenomenal (minus the mashed potatoes).  I also had a coffee which was great, but it would be even better if they offered French press coffee.   Great job guys!!!   Also, the history behind this place is amazing to read. To have come from a one store, Louisiana location to the chain that it is today is phenomenal journey that everyone should know."}
{"text":"Out visit was great. So Yon was a great server and was very attentive. I got the filet med rare which was cooked perfectly. My husbad got the rib eye which was well done. He asked for it to be med rare. The manager came and switched his steak out right away. The crab stuffed mushroom were amazing. Overally this experience was better than I expected."}
{"text":"I am being very generous here, because the expectations were so much higher. They jam packed us among a heard in the middle of the room. They couldn't  remember whose drink was whose and they brought my girlfriends meal out wrong, oh yeah, and it was her birthday. Well I just dropped the rating again, just remembering the experience we had. Then as they went back to fix her meal again, they just let mine sit out in front of me and get cold, cause you know if I started eating before her, not a good idea. When they finally brought her meal, we told them that mine wasn't hot anymore so they went back and nuked it, nuked it, I am paying $150+ for the 2 of us. Oh hell no!!! So we choked down our meals which were all right, I have had better. No apologies, no manager apologies, nothing. Might not ever go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The rib steak (bone in is ALWAYS better folks!!), is always good.  Order all steaks with extra butter... trust me!  Sweet potato casserole is awesome!  Skip the creamed spinach side, it's totally under-seasoned (seriously, has Ruth heard of salt and a touch of nutmeg folks???, both mandatory for great spinach!!).  And the garlic bread is ALWAYS great, hard not too eat too much!  Appetizers are pretty underwhelming and boring, as are the app salads."}
{"text":"soooo Good. We did have to wait even though we had a reservation but the wait was worth it. I will say on a day like Christmas Eve I think they should have treated us to the drinks since we had to wait about 45 minutes but hey. It was super expensive but the best steak I have had ...ever. The waiter was really nice and our table was great. It was a small room but still felt cosy."}
{"text":"Some of the best steaks just like the one back home, food is always on point. Spiced lobster ( appetizer ) was great. Bone in ribeye does not disappoint. The service is a different story here. For a group of 5 that is spending $1,000.00 for dinner, you would think the sever would be on top of there game. Very little check in, had to ask multiple time to get refills and clear plates from our table... What a shame"}
{"text":"It had been a while since we had been to a Ruths Chris Steakhouse... We will be back soon! Everything from the appetizers all the way through our entrees were absolutely amazing! The service was equally as great... Oh, the wine was pretty darn good as well."}
{"text":"I must say, this place has a wonderful atmosphere and the staff was very friendly and professional. My husband and I ordered the 40 oz. Porterhouse to share along with 3 side dishes (sweet potato with pecan crust casserole, garlic mashed potatoes, and green beans with garlic), and dessert (creme brulé).  Most items are available ale' cart.  Everything was extremely tasty and although it is a bit pricey, it is very much worth it if you ever want to splurge."}
{"text":"I took my sweetheart here for his thirtieth birthday when we were in Vegas. You definitely get what you pay for...we had one of the best meals of our lives here. Perhaps it was the knowledgeable, efficient, humorous, friendly and attentive servers that helped knock this restaurant out of the park, but the food was absolutely on point to say the least. I didn't care that our food and drink bill was upwards of $250! We loved watching the sideshow act going on in the street below our window-side table. Lucky for us that we have a Ruth Chris in our Bay Area city so that we can enjoy it on our next special occasion!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate the birthday of a close friend. I can honestly say that Ruth Chris gave us an amazing experience from the time we walked in the door to the time we left. Unfortunately we were truly disappointed with the food. I ordered the seabass and lobster mac and cheese. I was expecting my seabass to be tender and flaky as I've had it like that at many other restaurants, but instead it was really thick and not soft in the center. I was cutting it as if it was a steak. Not the best choice on the menu. I also had the lobster mac and cheese that was extremely bland and barely had any cheese. My friend said his steak was also bland so that was a disappointment in itself.
The best thing on the menu was the glass of wine and champagne that my friend and I shared. I would think since I spent $175 for two meals that the food would be mind blowing. Unfortunately it left us a little disappointed that Ruth Chris didn't live up to the hype.
I will say that our waitress Erin was AMAZING. She didn't rush and catered to us the entire time. I would have loved to share with her my disappointment with the food, but I always find it rude to send food back to the chef."}
{"text":"We walked in for happy hour... took a look around... smelled like a funeral home...

Walked out....

Maybe this place is good if you are retired...."}
{"text":"I still think this place is over priced, & the steaks is not all that great. I prefer Flemings. This time I went in for a birthday dinner & the waiter had messed up our ordered, as we told him we wanted our steak medium rare but three of our steaks came out well done. We had to wait another 20 mins for our steaks but by that time our friends were already close to done with their dinner. So, if anyone like their steaks medium rare make sure they get it right the first time or you'll be waiting like us! Overall, their alcohol is great, i had this amazing drink called raspberry Rosemary Cosmo omg.. that was the best alcohol drink I've ever had & u can get pretty tipsy of one. Lol."}
{"text":"In one sentence: Think Baton Rouge or The Keg with a 25% menu price hike, comfier leather chairs, decent consistent food, and waiters who have been forbidden from smiling.

So why 4 stars then ? Because this restaurant offers something quite rarely found in downtown Toronto's steakhouses: consistency. Granted, their ribeye doesn't match that of Jacob's or Harbor 60's but I promise you'll get the same size of flavorful, sizzling steak every single time you visit. Had this business been operating in the US, it would've received 3 stars at most. But the premium they charge for their package in Toronto is well thought out: Ambience, wine variety, decor, speed of service, food consistency.

Tip: If you are a group, you will be given attention. If you are a couple, do not settle for a table that sits besides a larger group table: you will be neglected."}
{"text":"My fiancé surprised me with a date night here. Todd was our spectacular waiter and had everything we ordered come out to perfection. I ordered the Chefs Special which was the BLT salad, filet mijon with shrimp, and green beans for the side. I didn't know I was hungry, but I finished every bite. 
The cucumber ranch dressing that came with the salad was so amazing, creamy, and fresh! 
We had plenty of left overs that were packed up for another amazing dinner tomorrow.

Thank you Todd for making our evening very special!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. We had a great time. I got the chopped salad which was perfect & salmon. Everyone else loved their food as well."}
{"text":"Really good chicken dish. 
Staff is fairly attentive. 
Outdoor seating with fireplace. 
Good calamari, bread, and salads."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent dinner with fantastic service. Unfortunately for us and the rest of the small room, we were next to a couple who was racist (\"our server is Mexican and doesn't understand us\") and every of their FIVE (each) Martinis was made wrong, which they still double fisted, as well as their steak over seasoned and cooked well done however, \"we will take it home.\"  The man got in the face of the acting manager (who is normally the head bartender) and threatened him to the point the cops were going to be called.  

We had a wonderful dinner and just wanted to credit the bartender/acting manager for handling the situation well and being professional. He didn't cater to them or their passive aggressive rude behavior. He handled the situation perfectly. 

I feel more terribly for the couple next to us who was dressed up and celebrating their anniversary and had to sit next to this low rent couple. When they didn't engage, they were called \"typical f'ing liberals.\" Hopefully they still had a good dinner regardless of this couple. 

Our night was entertaining to say the least with an unfortunate reminder that money doesn't buy class however, our food was excellent as always and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Dear Ruth--Your son Chris must have been some kind of wonderful because he inspired some of the best food to ever hit my mouth!!!  I love you all dearly!!!

I am always on the search for a good steak and Charlotte has plenty of \"ruth-like\" places where you order a ridiculously expensive steak and then share a couple sides.  But somehow out of all the places I always return to my first love.  

I just simply love the food here.  The steak just has NOT been beat in my opinion.  I always get the filet and it always melts in my mouth and I can always cut it with a butter knife or fork.  It is tender, it is juicy, it requires no additional seasoning, it is PERFECT.

The sides not just compliments to the meal, they are essential and just as good as the main dish.  I love their mashed potatoes (regular or sweet), their broccoli au gratin is amazing, and you can close your eyes and point to any of the salads listed and you will be satisfied.  

I haven't tried all of the desserts but their bread pudding makes me want to jump for joy.  Food excites me.  It's weird.  I know.

This last visit to Ruth's was for a special celebration and I didn't think the quality of service was up to par.  They seemed rushed and our server seemed to go missing quite frequently.  They just didn't have that \"it\" factor this time for some reason.  It was the day after Christmas so maybe that is why...I don't know.  Normally I walk in and am greeted as if I was their special guest and I leave feeling like I was treated like royalty.  This time, not so much.  However, I don't care because the food was all that and then some.  I would still return again and again because they just do it right!!

If anyone has suggestions on a place they have been that tops this steak I want to hear about it!  Don't tell me the Palm, Flemmings, Sullivan's  or Del Friscoes.  I have compared all of those places.

Until then....much love to Ruthy :)"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris would you marry me? After that night, I couldn't get you out of my mind. You have forever changed my view on steaks... lol
Okay, let get serious, shall we? We're going to do it \"Chopped\" style!

1.Presentation: the filet mignon was still sizzling when brought out (even 10 minutes late the plate was still freaking hot). My plate was very simple since there was only a piece of steak right in the center of the dish. And I received a bowl of mashed potato which was filled to the top (southern style).

2. Taste: ......Marvelous.... after taking the first bite, I thought to myself, \"what have I been eating my whole life?\". Yep, that's how good the steak was. I ordered medium-rare, which I was expecting a steak that once sliced that the juice would come out. I was terribly wrong. Instead, my steak was well aged, which allows the meat to be flavorful and moist. As for the seasoning, I didn't add any! The meat, itself, was seasoned with salts and peppers. So unlike typical southern's steak (thanks god) it wasn't buttery. Though the cheesecake dessert could've been better because it was kind of plain-jane.

Creativity: Obviously everything was simple since they want the steak to be in the spotlight. Which I think was suitable for the restaurant.

Sadly, the only flaw that matter to me is the price. It's not a place that you can go everynight (good god, $40 for a steak) but it's a great place for a special occasion. Such as a date or something along that line. :)"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because my date was so well known here, or maybe it really was my winning smile and hot shoes, who knows? All I know is that I was treated like royalty and had one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.

We started at the bar, sharing a lovely cabernet and some conversation with the bartenders and the maitre d'. Part of me wants to call it glad-handing, but (and I can say this about every time I had been here), the staff truly was happy to see us, ask my friend for updates on his goings-on, and make sure that we were extremely well taken care of. We took our time, never feeling rushed, and just enjoyed our time.

When we decided we were ready to be seated, we were ushered into a private booth in what was, for most of our meal, a private room. The bottle we brought with us was waiting on the table. Once we settled in, it was decanted and shared (of course!) with our waiter, Tommy, and Jay, the maitre d'. Our order was taken, and the expert, personal service continued.

The lobster bisque was fantastic. Creamy, rich, and with a depth of flavor I rarely find. It was truly one of the best I have had. 

*tangent*

I would love to do a taste test between this and the one at the Grotto at Golden Nugget... also one of my faves. Might have to plan that. Any takers? ;) Ahhh, I digress.

*/tangent*

The lobster tail was prepared very well, buttery with a generous portion of garlic. It came cut up and not on the tail. This is fine, though I would have preferred it slightly less cooked; the broil on the end was unnecessary in my opinion. However, it was still sweet, tender and beautifully done. The potatoes he ordered to go with his lobster were OK. Not amazing, but done well.

My filet with blue cheese crust was absolutely, spot-on, perfect. Rare with a cool red center, the blue cheese crust just slightly browned, and seasoned well. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender.

The service was, if you haven't guessed it yet, the highlight of the night. We declined dessert but opted for the recommended second bottle of wine. Tommy's choice was great and inspired a lovely conversation about wine, origins, vintages, and (most important!) \"drinkability.\"

One of the best parts? I had shared earlier a story about how this restaurant was the first steakhouse I had been to in Vegas... brought here by my late father almost 2 decades ago and taught how to properly order a charred-rare, blue cheese filet. Well, this got back to Marcel, the owner, who came over and spoke with me a bit, trying to remember my Dad, and sharing stories of his own. There was something so touching, so sweet about his appearance and willingness to share.

We were well fed and everyone made us feel welcome, honored, and important. Aside from the OK potatoes and the personal preference on the lobster, this was a perfect, five-star, par excellence experience.

As I kissed Marcel on the cheek on my way out, I promised I would be back."}
{"text":"My partner and I ate twice here during our six day stay at Harrah's. The food was just as good as one expects from Ruth's Chris (that is, excellent) and I was equally impressed both by the lamb chops I had on the first visit and the sea bass that I had on the second visit. The cocktails are also quite tasty. The service was excellent and timely during both visits.

Taking off one star because during our first visit I was given medium well lamb chops instead of the medium rare that I ordered. They did replace it, but by that time my partner had finished his meal, which made our experience a little less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Always a great time and service speaks for itself. Ribeye and filet were off the charts while the sides of mashed potatoes and green beans sent meals over the top. A can't miss for sure."}
{"text":"Went to here for my birthday before going to watch the Rays smoke the Indians. Service was great, appetizers were delicious (crab stuffed mushrooms) and wine was wonderful. Highly suggest the stuffed chicken breast, hands down the best chicken we have ever had! Would be 5 stars but my ribeye was a thin flavorless afterthought."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris---we meet at last! 

I've heard amazing things about Ruth's Chris over the years but for one reason or another, have never found the time to actually try it out myself. Well that changed last week and I am so glad to finally be in the know. 

The restaurant itself is very welcoming, the ambiance embraces you instantly. The service was great and so was the food! I had the petite filet with grilled shrimp. It's true they prepare their meat with pride--medium, melt-in-your-mouth rare. Oh my... 

On the side, potato au gratin and broccoli au gratin. And no, there is no such thing as too much cheese---in case you were wondering or perhaps judging. And as one does while in the South, all washed down with the tastiest sweet tea. 

At this point, I'm feeling officially initiated and plan on seeking out more Ruth whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service at this place. Ran into the head coach of the Cavaliers after one of their playoff games (tip: he ate at the bar dining area). Love the Ruth's Chris 3 part meal. Great dessert!!!"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, and usually steakhouse chains are dependable for quality and service. Ruth Chris didn't fail to provide.

It was the summerlicious menu so my partner had a three course meal for 55 which is incredible deal. I had the fillet. All cooked to perfection. 

The service was very professional, I had noted on the reservation it was a birthday dinner so I'm absolutely incredibly yummy chocolate cake arrived on the house.

Food portions are generous and in fact I walked out with the doggy bag of 1/3 of my fillet. 

A high-end steakhouse chain. It is what it is. And it is good."}
{"text":"Camacho was our server, this guy was right on point. kept our drinks cold, great conversationalist, always checked on us and made sure our food was perfect!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend an i went to Ruths on a Friday night.  We had reservations and actually got seated early with no problems.  Our waiter, Marvin, was really great answering our questions about the menu.  He recommended the porter house for 2 and it was perfect.  He made us really feel that we were wanted there and appreciated.  I would go back again for their great steaks, but i would hope we could sit again in Marvin's section."}
{"text":"Sorry to ruin the 5 star streak, but I have my own opinions. To start off, what can I say. The place is nice and everything is what it should be for a steak house in Las Vegas. Their menu is short giving you a few options, although it's short it has all the necessary items. They have everything from Ruth's favorite, family sized sides, big and petite steaks, kids menu, and deserts. I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, 40 oz porterhouse for two (medium rare), and lobster Mac n Cheese as a side. Let's start with the shrimp cocktail. It came with cocktail sauce, salad, and 4 jumbo sized shrimp. The shrimp with plump and soft. Supremely sweet and perfect with the sauce as it's sidekick. Next the main event the steak. I got the porterhouse because it gives me two different cuts of steaks. The filet and strip. I must say presentation was pretty awful for this dish. The steak was cut up with 3 chunks on either side and had this massive bone just nuzzled in between. The steak was so dry that I unfortunately had to dip the steak in A1, one side was more brown than the other, it was ice cold when I bit into it. The steaks color transitioning of medium rare was totally uneven and instead a target color type of steak instead of a sea of red. Lastly the lobster Mac n cheese. The presentation was average. What more can you expect from Mac and cheese. The macaroni itself was good, however a little to soft and past al dente. The cheese was completely set and not gooey when it got to my table. However the star of this dish, the lobster should go back into the sea. First of all, the lobster was not fresh. You were biting the sea instead of a succulent plump and sweet piece of lobster. Overall overcooked pasta, cold cheese, and fishy lobster do not go well together. The service here is spot on, so is the setting. What makes this place deserve a 2 star is the food and the price that comes with it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and a wonderful place to go with friends or celebrate a special event.  The steaks are outstanding and the overall presentation is wonderful.  It is very convenient to go to and the parking options are great with the valet.  Highly recommend this for a great night out."}
{"text":"We had reservations on March 18 for originally at 7:00 pm for a party of 6 that I scheduled on line. Our party later had to be at a comedy show that started at 9:00 pm so I decided to call and change our reservations to 6:00. There was reservations at an earlier time. But then a day later the manager called me back and told he happy to change my reservation. From the moment we arrived we were treated like kings and queens every servers knew we had another engagement and was very timely while serving us. Each one was very professional and very pleasant.The manager came to our table to make sure we were within our time frame and ask about the service. I have nothing but high reviews and the highest compliments.The service was incredible and the food was excellent. Also the decor and the ambience was beautiful.Thank you Ruth Chris and staff for honoring us and coming back to Cleveland, Oh"}
{"text":"The food was great! It came out and in a timely manner. However, the server Nicole was rude and seemed very uninformed about the the steakhouse customer service policy. She spoke in a demeaning manner to my table and should be given a review on the customer service policy."}
{"text":"Went to their Panthers pregame Sunday lunch.  Bad deal.  Overpriced, basically a dinner menu with a handful of overpriced lunch choices.  Went here because we couldn't get reservations at Mimosa Grill which is the real pregame value downtown.  Definitely wouldn't recommend Ruth's Chris for a pregame meal thought it might be okay for dinner if you want a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"This Ruth's Chris Steak House is located at Scottsdale and Indian Bend roads.

The dining area is somewhat darkly lit.

To begin, I like any of the shrimp -- whether it be the Barbecued Shrimp or Shrimp Cocktail. For the entrée, I recommend a Filet or a T-Bone; the latter, if you have a big appetite.

Appetizer prices range from about $13 to $16. Steaks range from about $35 to $45. However, there is a Porterhouse that is to feed two people. The Porterhouse for two is upwards of about $80.

My main problem with Ruth's Chris Steak House is that they seem to butter the steak excessively. Moreover, the prices are a bit inflated for what you get -- which is expected.

Perhaps my discontent is with the mass-produced feel I get with any chain restaurant (not just Ruth's Chris)."}
{"text":"Got the 8oz Petite Filet and OMG. Definitely don't need sauce. Soooo tasty!  Got the mashed potatoes a la carte and they were amazing as well. Have a nice wine selection. Definitely would come here more often. 

Let's not forget the crab cakes appetizer!!! We all know the are pricey but totally worth it. Every bite was amazing."}
{"text":"As expected they have an excellent standard. The food was great.  For all you spicy lobster appetizer lovers get  it now they said soon it will be off the menu every where."}
{"text":"Was here about 2 years ago.  Very pricey steak experience  but the steaks are quite good and are worth trying once.   Lighting is poor which makes it hard to get  really good pictures of the food. Bright lights are a foodies joy . The customer service is very good with the server and manager checking on tables consistently. Reason I  take a star away is the lighting and the fact that sides are not included with ones  meal. Many restaurants include sides with their steaks as part of a combo.  I recommend Ruths Chris  for anyone wanting a taste of premium steaks ."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I begin salivating at the thought of a nice, big, juicy slab of beef... and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse certainly knew how to deliver.

I was lucky enough to be taken here on a date with my boyfriend, who also craves the odd steak.  Well, we were definitely pleased with the decor of the place.  It was classy, but not uncomfortable.  It had very nice ambiance for an intimate date setting.  The decorations were fitting to the menu and atmosphere.  The interior gets 5 out of 5 from me.

And the food, oh,the food.  Both mine and my boyfriends steaks were cooked to perfection; mine med-rare, his blue-rare.  The meat was delicious and succulent, with a flame-grilled taste to it.  And we were able to get a couple of delicious sides to go with the steaks.  This is one restaurant that really knows how to sauté a mushroom; not crunchy and overcooked, instead juicy and blackened nicely.  My boyfriend was cute enough to order us a bottle of wine, which was probably way to expensive, but a nice little touch.  I was honestly shocked and pleased with how nice and delicious our meal was.  The food gets 5 out of 5 too.

Actually, everything gets 5 out of 5... which is why I gave it 5 stars!  Our waiter was super nice, funny, but professional all at the same time.  It was such an enjoyable time I would recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone.  Sadly, my boyfriend was able to snag the bill before I could have a look at it, but I'm sure it was up there."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad."}
{"text":"I came here with a bachelorette party of twelve girls. The service was wonderful: prompt, attentive, and friendly. I feel like they allowed us to be louder than the typical quiet atmosphere of a Ruth Chris, which I appreciated because, hey, it's Vegas!

I ordered a filet and we ordered a bunch of sides so I was able to try the creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, and mashed potatoes. All the sides were delicious, especially the spinach! The filet was juicy and tender. I've been to Ruth Chris in Cancun and Irvine and this Ruth Chris meets the same standard of deliciousness as the others.

I was disappointed with their deserts though! I got the cheesecake and the layer on top was more bitter than sweet (weird for cheesecake) and the graham cracker tasted stale. Would not recommend cheesecake here.

If you're in Vegas and want to celebrate a special event, Ruth Chris is always a dependable good place to eat."}
{"text":"Another wow'd performance at Ruth's Chris.  After a gorgeous and extroverted bartender poured me a delicious beer, we sat down for our meal, where the remarkable service began.

The first indication of world-class service happened before we even sat down.  Our hostess immediately picked up our white napkins and replaced them with black ones, knowing that we had on darker clothing and did not wish to take the little fuzzes with us - exactly what should have happened, but often doesn't.

After ordering the wine, I'm having a quiet conversation with the Mrs. and I make a comment to her that I felt a draft - the air conditioner was blowing on my head and I could feel it.  Not strongly enough to make a fuss, I just noticed it and said something to my wife.

Not three minutes later, the waiter at the next table over visits us and explains that he has turned off the A/C so it would stop blowing on my head - outstanding!  

The incredible service was amplified with our top-flight waiter who was there when we needed him and left us alone when we didn't.  

At one point I asked him, \"If we don't finish this bottle of wine, can we recork it and take it with us?\"
\"Absolutely,\" he replied, \"we even have a special, sealable bag that goes on top.  Would you like for me to decant the wine?\"
\"Well, I would prefer to decant it, but if you do, I won't be able to take it home if we don't finish it,\" I say quasi-dissapointedly.  
\"Not a problem, sir, I would be happy to pour whatever you don't finish in the decanter back into the bottle, seal it, and send you on your way.\"

Take notes other restaurants out there (Morton's, DelFrisco's, Flemings) - This is how you wow customers.

The stuffed mushrooms were very good, but truth be told, I prefer more \"chunky\" crab meat in them as opposed to the crab meaty paste.  Our steaks were delicious, as per usual, really are top notch on quality, food temperature, preparation, and taste.  Our garlic mash was great, but our asparagus was a bit blah.  I know they're not exactly in season at the moment and I have to have some knock, right?  Overall the food was excellent.  

A terrific dining experience accompanied by beautiful company and an extensive wine list creates a perfect recipe for a satisfied customer - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I updates my review on this place. I travel a ton for work and I love going to Ruth's Chris around the US. It was my momma's bday and I suggested it to the fam. 

Came on Halloween night, it was pretty dead which was nice! Their outside patio is AWESOME and we sat out there because the weather was so nice. 

We ordered the ahi tuna, calamari and shrimp as apps. Everyone said they were real good especially the tuna. 

For dinner, we ordered two 11oz filets, bone in filet, ribeye and fish. My filet was the only problem child - it was covered in fat and I KNOW better to ask for a center cut from Ruth's. Waitress was super understanding. Also, our shoestring fries were super cold, so got a redo on those as well. My filet came back out and was perfectly cooked and center cut (yessssss). 

Overall, we had a nice dinner with the family. Had to kick down a star due to the screw ups on food and we had to ask them to remove the filet off the bill. 

Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my France's birthday and boy did he enjoy it!! 

I ordered the petite filet. Medium. This was a perfect size for me and came out exactly how I liked it. The flavoring was so delicious!! My fiancé ordered the ribeye and he absolutely loved it! For sides I ordered the grilled asparagus and my fiancé ordered the shoestring fries. The sides are a very big size so it's best to share. I also had the raspberry Rosemary Cosmo which was good. 

The restaurant made our evening very special and since it was my fiancé' birthday he even got dessert.  I think my only disappointment was that they didn't have any rice as a side. And I love rice with my steak. The customer service was amazing and this place is definitely worth it for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese chicken and found a piece of the plastic bag cooked in with my chicken. I didn't find the bag until I had eaten half of the chicken. They got one star because I had to give at least one."}
{"text":"When I first heard about this steakhouse and how expensive I was, I was completely ready to come here, eat a meal, and criticize the crap out of it for being overpriced and pretentious.

As soon as you get into the restaurant you are immediately hit with the smell of butter. It is so strong, it really got my stomach growling.

I ordered the filet, medium rare. The plates they are served on are sizzling hot that you can hear the meat still cooking on it. As I cut into it, it was like beautiful butter being sliced. I slowly and brought the piece to my mouth and chewed. I had to begrudgingly smile because DAYUM it was so damned good. I can still think back to that moment and it will make my mouth water just thinking about it.

I've been here twice now and the steaks have been consistently the best I've ever eaten and I've eaten a lot of steaks in lots of different places. 

The sides are big so definitely recommend sharing them. I would recommend the mash. It is so creamy and smooth and compliments the steaks so well. The shoestring fries are also nice.

Service is pretty basic, nothing special.

I'd like to admit that I am pretty stingy when it comes to spending money on food. I expect that if you're gonna charge me an arm and a leg, it better be some damn good food. Ruth's Chris definitely hits the mark. So as much as I don't want to admit a steak is worth that much, it is definitely worth every begrudging penny. It's not a place I can afford to come to regularly, but great for those special occasions."}
{"text":"food was great.  service was great.  walking thru Harrahs to get there was crowded and crappy and kindof ruined it.   expensive, probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I love Ruth's Chris Steak House!!! I've always had great service and delicious meals!!! Looking forward to my next visit !"}
{"text":"We ate here during Arizona Restaurant Week.  I have to say - top notch service and great food. They were very attentive - never had even close to an empty glass and they were good about checking back with us without bothering us. 

The steaks were absolutely amazing and loved that they had raw horseradish- my favorite. 

For dessert we had cheesecake and the chocolate sin cake - both delicious. We were celebrating a birthday so we got a banana cream pie to go - also delicious. 

Great birthday experience!!"}
{"text":"I recently had my first visit to a Ruth's Chris Steak House last week in Vegas, and I have to say, it is pretty darned good.

Our server, Dora, was first rate. Very funny and attentive not to mention extremely knowledgeable about the menu.

I started with the spicy lobster appetizer which Dora said was her favorite appetizer on the menu. It was amazing. It was so good in fact that I almost cancelled my steak and just ordered two more portions of the spicy lobster.

I also had the Harvest Salad which was quite tasty as well. One of the better dinner salads that I have ever had.

For dinner I had the Filet Mignon. It was 11 ounces and quite good, although I will say that it was under cooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). It was also just a little chewy. I have had better cuts at other restaurants, but it was still good and I still finished it.

On the side I had the loaded baked potato which I split with someone else. Again, it was good, but I have to admit that I have had better. Morton's baked potatoes put the Ruth's Chris potatoes to shame, but it was still good.

Oh, I almost forgot, our dinner also came with this amazing French bread. It was warm and soft and all kinds of awesome. 

After dinner we were absolutely stuffed, so I can't comment on the desserts. I will add that this location (which is inside Harrah's Casino) has a really nice view of the strip, especially Caesar's Palace.

Overall it was a fantastic dining experience. It is not cheap, so be prepared to spend some cash, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little girl. It has always been my favorite steakhouse of all time. I have been to about 10 different locations. I've been to this location about four times. Let me tell you about the last time....

We arrived on time and they took us to our table immediately. They were going to put us in a table in the middle somewhere. I asked if we could sit by the window to see the view of the strip. And, they granted our wish. They came and took our drink order. And, brought out the very delicious bread with soft whipped butter.

I ordered without even opening the menu. I do this to impress whoever I'm with. The crab cakes came out sizzling hot. It's 99% crab, the way it should be. I also love their butter sauce with little pieces of that bell peppers.

My ribeye came out sizzling hot, well done charred, just how I like it. He got a petite fillet which he enjoyed very much. For the sides, we got the creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin and the most delicious sweet potato casserole in the world! I love this place! I have since I was a little girl and I'm sure I will even when I will be in elderly old lady!"}
{"text":"What to try?

Their ribeye steak! 

I personally liked their rib eye steak more so than the filet mignon. Maybe because of the extra fat to give you the satisfying finish at the end of each bite? Hah. The filet mignon is the best cut of the cow but because that piece in the cow does not have as much fat, I thought it takes more effort to make it perfect to my taste and satisfaction. I also tried the filet mignon and I thought it was okay. 

I do like the way Ruth's Chris makes their steak though. Served on a hot plate has always been my way of eating steak. Steaks are usually big when they come to you and you also have to cut the steak to pieces to fit in your mouth. With all the cutting, by the time you get to the middle of the steak, the steak is cold already! And we don't like cold steak! 

The sides are good too. The sides come as shareable plates and each side can be shared easily with two or more people. I personally love cremini mushrooms and creamed spinach as the sides. The sweet yam casserole was good but it felt like a dessert more so than a side to compliment your meal. 

The desserts were okay. Not something to particularly look forward to. Cheesecake was served with berries and the chocolate sin cake was wayyy too sweet for my liking. 

Last tip?

{"text":"Located on the second floor of Harrah's, with its own designated elevator, all I can say is this place is over-priced, okay-quality steak, and has poor presentation of food. 2 stars because I've experienced much better!! 

I came in with my family (10 people) for a Christmas dinner. Dimly-lit atmosphere, okay service. You can order with a set course meal or just by the plate. 

My family started off with calamari and shrimp cocktails. Shrimp cocktails only consist of 4 shrimps per plate but I will admit that the shrimp was a good size. Both were okay. 

I started with the lobster bisque which was pretty good. As for the steaks, they are expensive because they are bigger than usual for the size. 

I got a 20 oz Ribeye ($50), med/rare and it was juicy! Good at first, but then when I got to the center, it became dry, which started to take awhile for me to chew. They also charge you for sides that you order, so if you only order a steak, that's all you get. Which is why I am saying poor presentation of food. Can't offer a little flower on the side to make it look a little better? 

I've had much better steak for cheaper or equivalent prices. I would suggest you guys to go elsewhere if you don't want to get ripped off. 

My family ordered the 19 oz filet mignon's and weren't satisfied with the way they cooked it. One was more well done than the other (compared to my parents), and they both got med/rare. 

According to my flight attendant, you can get much better steak off the strip at gentleman club's....such as Treasures. I have yet to try though."}
{"text":"Customer Service: Friendly hostess, friendly waiter, over all very pleasant. 

Wine: Good selection, but quite pricey. I understand that all restaurants have a large mark up on alcohol to create profit, but this was like getting a bottle for $12 and selling only half of the bottle for $30. 

Bread & Butter: Bread was average/disappointing, can't imagine them making this in-house. Butter was whipped so there is your A+

Starter: The salad was extremely sub par. The Romaine lettuce was yellow. There was way too much parmesan, and it was tasteless. I can find a greener salad with more flavour at a fast food joint.

Main: An extremely hot dish sizzling with butter does not sound appealing to me. Yes, my steak did arrive at medium-rare but as it continued to cook in the hot butter dish I was left with a medium-done steak. Not to mention, even though I was warned, I did burn my had from grazing the dish as I reached for my glass of water. They need to get over this gimmick of a sizzling plate and serve a steak properly. Not to mention how disgusting it is to think of a beautiful cut of meat being ruined by all that butter.

Side Dish: I got a whole lot of mushrooms that were sitting in some butter broth. As I spooned my mushrooms onto my dish and tried one I became extremely disappointed. I didn't know there was a way to make mushrooms tasteless, but they found a way. 

Dessert: The cheesecake and key-lime was amazing. This must be out sourced. Good job on choosing a great bakery to buy your desserts from! 

Coffee: $5 Cappuccino tastes like instant coffee. After two sips that was put down and never touched again. 

OVERALL: Go for the service, and their dessert. Oh, and if you like whipped butter."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to visit several Ruth's and as usual they never disappoint .. my husband and I dined here Valentines weekend .. our reservations was for 7;45... we arrived 7;30 , were immediately greeted and seated within moments .. our waiter  took our drink orders and served us warm fresh bread...for our appetizer we enjoyed  the bbq shrimp which were amazing , for our main course we ordered each the filet Mignon as well as the cream spinach .. the steaks were cooked to our perfection and the cream spinach was delicious !! We finished off with a slice of the best cheesecake ever.. the waiter and staff were all knowledgeable as well as welcoming... just writing this makes me ready to return right now!!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive for the quality of food. The bread seemed nuked, the well done steak still had pink in the middle, the lamb was over done. The spinach at $12 a plate was boiled. Way way overpriced for the quality. Am never going back there, I felt totally ripped off. Service was good, the waiters/hostess was great."}
{"text":"Came here for my SO's birthday dinner.

Service: Impeccable. 5/5. Some of the best service I've had in the city in a long time!!! All the staff was knowledgeable, the hostess was great-wished my SO \"happy birthday\" upon arrival and called me \"Ms. last name\". Overall, polite and friendly with attention to details on the online reservation. Our waitress (Lidia) was on point, she answered my questions, very knowledgeable about food. She was very attentive. This aspect alone is worth the repeat trip. 

Food: the steaks were great. If you didn't  know, the steaks are served on a sizzling platter and butter sauce so the meat stays warm. I asked about the cook of my meat as I didn't want it to over cook sitting on a hot plate w butter sauce. The waitress informed me that the kitchen has accounted for this, so they cooks the steaks more rare. I got a petite filet and SO got a huge steak, we like our steaks Chicago style. See pictures (I wish I remembered to write Chicago style on my uploaded pictures but now I can't edit it). Both steaks were tender, flavourful and downright delicious. We had the shrimp app, which was literally something we ordered in New Orleans, so it was pretty authentic southern food. Sides we ordered included mushrooms ( huge! On steroids) and potatoes (again huge!). I don't know how others have experienced their time here given the three stars reviews, but we really enjoyed it. 

Chocolate sin birthday cake slice was automatically brought, I didn't have to secretly hunt down and ask the waitstaff. The cake was rich and smooth. Honestly, THE best service. 

Ambiance- old school cigar cellar. Dark woods, classy and upscale. From the elevator ride to the very clean bathrooms, great resto. 

Overall, it was a very special birthday for one of the most important ppl in my life. RC's service and food made the night memorable and fabulous. We really enjoyed ourselves and were so happy with the entire experience. I'm giving this a 5/5 bc the service was tremendous. Will def return for another special occasion and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Steak is a complete food. It has all the protein, fat and deliciousness I could ever want in a food. 

Now I have been to other Ruth Chris steak houses before. They are steak artists. On this particular occasion though, I was left a bit wanting. 
I will say, I wasn't at my best when I went to this particular Ruth Chris. It was at the end of a long booze filled weekend and we had an hour and a half to kill before we needed to be at the airport. I figured going back to San Diego with a belly full of delicious red meat and wine was an excellent choice. 

Right off, this Ruth Chris seemed a bit dated. There were no windows where we got seated and we were right in the path of the kitchen so we had frequent flybys from waiters and waitresses. I didn't so much mind as wondered why we got this table, on a slow Sunday evening. The server was nice enough, nothing special though. Like the waitress in \"Reservoir Dogs\"...\"she was nice!...um, she was ok. She only refilled my coffee three times. I'm used to it being refilled six times!\" and so on. I ordered the New York strip which I thought they would get spectacularly as they always do. I ordered it medium rear with a potato on the side. 

When I got it, I looked a little scrawny to be a 12 oz but oh well. It was a bit overdone and it was pretty greasy. It was served in a deeper dish than usual so a lot of the grease just pooled. 

I got through my overdone steak ok. I didn't want to be \"that guy\" and make a big deal but I was disappointed. I would go again and definitely the one here in SD though."}
{"text":"Beautiful food with friends and family.  But unfortunately the staff seem forget for our drink order and we have to wait some waiter who coming by near our dinner table.
The food is outstanding.  Hopefully sometimes we meet again and please don't forget our order."}
{"text":"I was there on my brother's birthday, we ordered the seared ahi-tuna, lobster bisque, medium well ribeye and medium rare cowboy ribeye. Unfortunately, the best dish was the lobster bisque for me. The sauce of the seared ahi-tuna completely covered the taste of the tuna, I could only taste mustard, and the tuna didn't feel fresh. The presentation of the steak was surprising, not as expected and very disappointing. The rib eyes came in dishes that looked a bit like a bowl, the plates were just a bit bigger than the steaks.  I do not know how they cooked the steaks but it seemed like they added a lot butter after the steak was cooked rather than while cooking. I could taste butter more than the steak. I felt that they have put in too much butter which made it very heavy. I could not even finish the steak because I was too heavy and oily. The lobster bisque was thick and tasted like lobster rather than tomatoes, as some restaurants use tomatoes as the soup base. I would give them credit for that.

Although the food wasn't as good as I thought it was, the service was excellent. Very polite waiter and someone who seems to be the manager checked in on us while we were eating. The atmosphere was great, very classy and relaxing. Only thing we didn't like about the service was the person who served us our steaks, he had the sizzling hot plate too close to me that I almost thought it would hit my face. Probably did not care and was not very polite. Other than that service was great. 


The bill ended up over $200, for the price of the food, it feels like I'm paying for the better than average service rather than premium food.

All in all, that was my only visit of the place so I can't really judge too much but I have been to Canoe and The Loose Moose in downtown Toronto, 17 in Mississauga,  Jack Astors, Crayon Creek, the Keg, and more. I would rank Chris Ruth's service after 17 and Canoe. And food wise, they are around the same level as Jack Astors. If you are looking for premium service and food, 17 would be well worth it, the prices were the same but the service and food were even better. It was a disappointing visit but at least the service is decent and the lobster bisque was good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to eat in Vegas and this visit was no exception. Great ambiance with a beautiful view of the strip. Food and cocktails were delicious as always. Our server, Jeffrey Wise, was attentive, professional, and friendly. We are never disappointed when we dine here!"}
{"text":"Obnoxiously expensive, but SO good.   Nothing 42 dollars should come on an appetizer plate, but their steaks are amazing.  The sides are way overpriced, but SO good- it's definitely a special occaision place or for people who have more money than they know what to do wtih.  Would go back for a special occasion. Better than Durants."}
{"text":"The manager at Ruth's Chris Michael is great and will go out of his way to ensure you have a wonderful evening. They uphold the name and make sure costumes are happy and come back!!"}
{"text":"This was a over priced restaurant. My filet was tough and over cooked.  The service was the worst service I have ever had.  Our waiter took our order and that was the last we saw of him other than him slipping our check on the side of the table.  The only thing good about this place was the bus gal.  She had a friendly smile and brought us some water.  The Ruth Chris in San diego was much better.  Do yourself a favor and pass this place on by.  The place was pretty empty when we came and now I understand why."}
{"text":"Not sure what is better... The People who work there or the food they make. Was there last night and had Venison Chops... Out of this world.  Spend the extra couple bucks, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Ruth Chris for many years and they are always on point. Amazing steaks and atmosphere. I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"We had a group dinner here.  Since there were 20 of us, we are always concerned that there will not be adequate service, someone's meal will come out late, etc. as this normally happens when we assemble.

The service was fantastic!  There was never an empty water glass, drinks were replenished with phenomenal speed, and our food was brought to us without even a hint of a hiccup.

The quality of the food was also fantastic.  Everything was cooked as ordered, and was fabulous.  

Yes, it is a little pricy.  However, you get what you pay for.  In my opinion, this restaurant is a great value in light of the return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here yesterday and the food was fantastic. Our dinner was delicious, great view and excellent guest service. The Manager Lisa is so friendly greeting all her guests asking how everything is making sure everything is great. She stops by all the tables making sure everyone is enjoying the experience. Our waiter Brock was very friendly and accomodating. Overall from entrance to exit, everyone is so welcoming the host team greets and thanks you for coming in. Our dinner was the ribeye steaks 3 course meal. We loved every bit of it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They are so sweet. I celebrated my birthday there and they sure know how to make you feel special. 
I told them my fav desert and they brought it over. So nice of them."}
{"text":"I went back to Ruth Chris the other night for a business dinner, and they continue to exceed my expectations every time. The steaks are always prepared to perfection, the drinks are stiff and the staff is attentive. 

The calamari is probably the best in town."}
{"text":"Every time my family heads to Ruth's Chris i am assured of a great meal and a very good atmosphere! The Happy Hour is just as good! This is my go to for a great steak and easy going feel. I have never had any problems with the service and the food is always cooked to my exact preference. I recommend everything. I have had it all!"}
{"text":"Ruth's was kind enough to grant us the opportunity to dine privately in their Wine Room. I had mentioned on Open Table that I was newly engaged, and it was our first time at Ruth's and I wanted it to be a special experience. 
When we arrived we were taken all the way to the back of the restaurant, puzzled my fiance gave each other a look that said \" Where are they taking us? Are we going to have to sit near a bathroom?\" 
To our surprise we were shown to the dimly and romantically lit wine room with a table for two. It was beyond romantic and such a unique experience. Stuart Greeted us at the table and gave his expert opinion on wine and food for the day. We were given a complimentary taste of Moscato, and at the end of the night dessert. 

The night overall could not have gone better, it was great to escape the restaurant week rush, and hide away in our own quite room. The food was amazing, we started off with calamari, and order scallop potatoes with our steaks, which were cooked perfectly and delicious. I enjoyed my experience, and hope I'll get to come visit again!"}
{"text":"Server was great along with the best Chop Salad and Ribeye in LasVegas

I highly recommend Ruth Chris"}
{"text":"Delicious steak. Classic atmosphere and decor. 3 stars because the pricing for the sides is far too high (meant for sharing, but our group had different tastes), and because I didn't feel they elevated the steak above places like the Keg or other steakhouses enough to justify the higher price."}
{"text":"The expensive steak had gristel, the service wasn't that great, the hostess was short with us, and you can get a much better meal and much cheaper at other places.  Save your money.  I did like sitting outdoors but the drinks were ridiculously expensive for what you get!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great vegan meal here.

I was here one March 14th celebrating a special holiday (look it up) some years ago and dreaded the dining experience, but our server made it dead simple. She was incredibly professional and knowledgeable and definitely accustomed to dealing with the corporate lunch crowd. I had a mind-blowing grilled portobello mushroom (this coming from someone who only likes mushrooms in a canned format), mashed potatoes that nearly blew me straight outta my seat, and a pairing of glazed carrots and string beans tasty enough to satisfy any discerning herbivore's palate.

Don't be fooled by the parking garage-style elevator, it'll take you right to the lobby of Ruth's Chris, I promise."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We went a month or so ago for our anniversary for a steak dinner in the dining room and came back today for happy hour in the bar. They serve my favorite onion rings with a delicious and unique Asian inspired dipping sauce. Of course, the steaks are also great as are their hamburgers which are only $7 during happy hour. I would pass on the seafood.

Love that they went all out with \" happy anniversary\" confetti to make celebrating such an occasion so much more special."}
{"text":"It's always nice to go to a fancy dinner when someone else is picking up the tab, right?  A bunch of us decided to take our business dinner allowance to Ruth's Chris, and it was a good meal.  There is a 3-course option for $35 or $39 (can't remember), and I ordered that once.  On my second trip, however, I decided to deviate slightly & get a wedge salad and that evening's special of NY steak and shrimp.  I would compare the wedge salad similar to what you get at Gordon Biersch - blue cheese crumbles, bacon bits and balsamic dressing.  I know some people don't like watery iceberg lettuce, but somehow this combo just works.  What is terrific about your steak being served on those super hot plates is that, and as your cut the steak the juices pool with the melted butter to make a really nice sauce.  

Service was very friendly, and they always ask if it's your first time, or if you are celebrating anything special.  I think the food is great, and the only reason I'm rating down slightly is that the prices at Ruth's Chris don't make it an everyday type of place, whereas I'm just as happy at Libra (Culver City, CA) for about half the price.  But, everyone should have a chance to splurge a few times a year and get a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow.....I read some reviews here before we embarked on this fiasco last night. Shoulda listened to the naysayers. Unfortunately, what sent us there was a $100 gift certificate. Shoulda wasted the gift certificate instead. Woulda gone to Delmonicos or ANY other steak house in LV. Coulda had a better steak at ANY steakhouse in LV. While I was leery of the decor and cleanliness, I was not at all put out by the ambience and decor. I guess I should give a few points for a pleasant server. That is where any positives end. Ordered escargot and a huge disappointment. Maybe 4 in a sauce with mushrooms that disguise themselves as snails. Both salads were so NOT memorable that I can't remember what they were. There was a big banner on the menu to ask the waiter about  the complementary  Oscar addition to any entree.  The server described it as a few ounces of king crab, sauce bearnaise and grilled asparagus. He did not however explain the cost of the complementary oscar addition. I have to admit that I did not think it would be free, but each Oscar added $40 to the price of the steak. I find that absurd. Just call me tight ass :) Steaks were not juicy.....just kinda mealy. To add to the lovely evening, we both got food poisoning symptoms in the middle of the night. I will spare you the ugly details. I will say that I wish I could have been able to share that delight with Ruth's Chris Steakhouse . Woulda, shoulda, coulda!"}
{"text":"Staff was great, food was great, fantastic experience.  Luke was our waiter and he exceeded our highest expectations. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I came here for a 50th birthday celebration.  The service was a little extra special.  Now I'm not sure if it's because our waiter thought my friend was Trisha Yearwood or if the service is just really that great.  Ha ha 


This location is really nice and classy.  Has a view to accompany the classy feel.  With all the fancy hotels in Vegas I would have never guessed I would find Ruth's Chris in the Harrah's hotel.  

Seriously, I've been to the Beverly Hills location and the service is always great so I'm sure it would be great even if the waiter didn't think he was serving a star.  There was a second waitress who came to assist and he shooed her off and said he could handle our group of 12 alone.  Wow, he did just that. Even with one, the service did not slack and he stayed on beat. (I'm very unhappy, I have forgotten his name)  

The food...well if you have never eaten at Ruth's Chris you must.  The lobster mac, and the sweet potato casserole are really heaven to your palette.  The BEST part, this is a steak house.  So order the bone in at medium or medium well (please don't char your steak with well done), and you will be satisfied with this wonderful food party. To wash everything down you can have one of their cocktails that will not disappoint either. Hands down, still the best steak I have ever had comes from Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week. I am not a big steak person so I opted for the stuffed chicken breast and spinach. The chicken breast is something special, definitely something to write home and tell everyone about. But the first thing I noticed was the smell of the carpet in the main dining room, not good when you are trying to eat. I tasted my nieces mashed potatoes and they were super bland, definitely didn't expect that from a steakhouse. I wasn't really impressed but I will say that I enjoyed my meal. The free valet was a plus. Will this make my list of go to restaurants no, but I would certainly go back for the chicken breast."}
{"text":"I took my almost husband here for his birthday last weekend. I'll openly admit I am a bit of food snob when entering into an establishment of this type. We did have to wait 20 minutes for a 7:30 reservation (Saturday night) so immediately, I was already a bit put off. We were finally seated at the table at the outside edge of the kitchen doors. Again, unhappy. I wait 20 minutes for a table when I had a reservation and then I get the worst seat in the house? Thanks. 

Then along comes our waiter and the night gets better! Fergus. Fergus rocked this. Fergus is Irish born, well spoken, clearly well educated, and provided spot on service and conversation. He knew the menu inside and out. Knew his beers and wines. We could totally hang with Fergus. 

The future husband and I don't eat alot (portion wise). So we opted to split the Cowboy Ribeye and take the 3 veggie combo platter for our side. We got the mashed tatos, onion rings and aspargus with holandaise sauce. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp for an app (friggin YUMMMMMY). The BBQ shrimp was only 5 pieces. Not cool for sharing. Should be 6. Otherwise, I was totally happy with it. Could eat that for days. The Cowboy (21 ounces) ribeye was flawlessy cooked and beautifully seasoned ever so mildly. The mashed were scratch made as was evidenced by the light lumpys within and tasty, just like home. The sauce for the aspargus was a bit too bitter but maybe its a southern thing. The veggies themselves were cooked perfectly. Tender but not soggy. The O rings....mmmmm. They, themselves, were great but they were served on a pool of thai chili sauce. Outstanding. 

Overall, the place is a tad over priced on some plates while the rest is quite fair for the quality of the food and service. The above mentioned plates plus 2 glasses of wine and two beers came to about $140. It was what I was expecting when I booked the table.

Great experience overall. Didn't like the treatment at the hostess stand very much. But Fergus more than redeemed the staff rating. The food was excellent with very little complaint at all. The valet was a nice guy. The interior was def a good setting for a romantic dinner. Would I go here again? Yup."}
{"text":"So good we ate here twice!  We're big steak eaters and this location of Chris does not disappoint.  We've been to the original in New Orleans but this one in Vegas, which over looks the center of the strip is truly great and what makes it great is the service.  Our server, made the experience.  We came back a second night and requested her, Darcel!!!  She is pleasant, jovial and she will help you navigate the menu like an  expert. She is absolutely amazing and she makes the experience. The second night we brought our friends with us. 
We ordered the porter house for two, rare.  It was amazing.  The filet side was was tender and rich.  The steak side a little more chewy, savory and with a distinct aged flavor.  You can taste the butter.  Absolutely served to perfection with a smile. We had the mash potatoes and creamed spinach both steakhouse staples and both excellent.
A can't miss in Vegas for steak fans.  If you want the truly exceptional experience book your reservation with Darcel for lots of laughs and wonderfully augmented selections."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a wonderful dinner at Ruth Chris.  The atmosphere is beautiful with nearly a 360 view of the Vegas strip.  We started with a vodka tonic and the blue cheese wedge which was made well for all blue cheese lovers.  Then we shared the garlic mashed potatoes and the medium rare 22 Oz cowboy bone in rib eye.  The potatoes we're delish and the steak was out of this world.  We finished with the chocolate duo which included a chocolate lava cake and chocolate moose = heaven. 

Our servers were attentive and we were in great hands.  

The only downside was the price.  Our shared dinner with tip was $210.  No regrets, I'd order again!"}
{"text":"We were worried that this location wouldn't live up to the Ruth's Chris name because it is on the Strip. It was delicious as always. Wonderful service. Beautiful view."}
{"text":"Found out the story of the name of the restaurant.  Chris Steak House had burnt down and Ruth bought out Chris Steeak House, thus the name Ruth's Chris Steak House.  Enough of history lesson...on to the food!

This was part of an office luncheon.  There were 6 of us - 5 ordered the Steak Sandwich and I ordered the 6 oz Beef Tenderloin.  The Steak Sandwich came with either soup or fries and a little salad.  Those who ate the Steak Sandwich loved it!   One of the 5 had the Louisiana Gumbo Soup and she liked it.  2 others orderd the Onion Soup Au Gratin and it was OK.  My lunch also came with a starter salad - it's OK, not fantastic.  My Beef Tenderloin was just right.  I had it done rare - it came out sizzling on a white plate and my 2 side choices of brocolli and mushrooms were a great combo to my lunch.   It was about the size of your palm and about 1 1/2 \" high just like a little cake!  

Dessert time!  OMG - it was the best part of the whole lunch - I had the Caramelized Banana Cream Pie - fantastic!  Then, we also ordered the Chocolate Sin Cake - so chocolatey and absolutely flourless!  The other 2 desserts were the Bread Pudding with the Whiskey Sauce - delicious and warm and finally, the Sesonal Berries with Sweet Cream Sauce - a little too sweet for me!  According to the waiter, the Bread Pudding and the Chocolate Sin Cake are the no. 1 favourites in the restaurant.   See photos.

It was an expensive meal but truly a memorable one!  If you want a fancy meal, pick Ruth's Chris Steak House."}
{"text":"Another great place for juicy stakes. The drinks are always good. The location is great, and if the weather is nice, it's always nice to sit outside and eat. Haven't had a bad experience here yet, and I plan to revisit soon"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here last night. (Fortunately, our anniversary coincides with Charlotte's Restaurant Week, so we were able to get an amazing meal at a much more inexpensive price.) 

Everything was amazing! We arrived at the restaurant about 30 minutes early, so we went to the bar...great bartending staff. I started off with a delicious flirtini off of the cocktails menu. Once our table was ready, we were escorted to our table and immediately greeted by our server with two flutes of champagne as a congrats for our anniversary. Very nice touch! 

Our meal was outstanding. I ordered the carrot and ginger soup, which was light and creamy. Then came the entrees. We both got filets, which came out on sizzling hot plates, so the meat stayed warm from the first to very last bites. We also ordered sides of the creamed corn and garlic mashed potatoes...yummy! Last, but not least, we had the mini cheesecake desserts. Perfect size and very light and sweet.

Every person who works there - from the valet to the wait staff, bartenders and the managers - are very professional and extremely nice. Great customer service!! When we made the reservation, we simply requested a dining experience that would make our anniversary special and memorable...they certainly did that!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of meat they serve. Too many outstanding steak houses here and unfortunately they lost their edge."}
{"text":"Good consistent steak house.  Great decor and friendly staff.  Good wine list and scotch list.  Need more fish and steak specials...."}
{"text":"I have been to two other Ruth's Chris restaurants and know the caliber in which they can perform. With that being said, this was a terrible experience. To be fair let me begin by saying my waiter was very friendly and professional (he is what earned this restaurant a two stars from me). I ordered a medium well petite filet. It was delivered well done so I sent it back requesting a new steak. My second steak was not the same quality of cut as the first and it was well done as well. On the third attempt the management told me they would bring it to me under done and allow their 500 degree plate to cook it through more completely. It arrived medium rare. The rest of my party was almost done eating and I now had to cut my steak into smaller pieces and finish cooking it myself by searing each piece on my plate. I was annoyed that I was paying almost $50 for a steak and it couldn't be prepared properly. As an apology they offered me a free $11 dessert but made me pay for the steak that I couldn't finish because the plate became too cold to continue cooking my steak on. Any subsequent trips to Vegas I will most certainly be choosing other steak houses."}
{"text":"Geez, where do I start. This place could be so much more successful with just a little attention to detail. It is located on the second floor of Harrah's which allows for a nice view of the strip - providing you get a table close enough to the windows. This was the first Ruth's Chris that I have been to and had high hopes for such a reputable name. 

There was a group of 11 of us and after all was said and done we spent a little over 3 hours and $1,800 (not including tip). The dress code posted at the hostess stand does not seem to be enforced. There were people in a wide range of attire, most not suitable for a high end steakhouse but I digress - after all, it is Vegas. There were kids screaming, yelling and running around most of our visit.  Again, not ideal for this type of environment. 

The wait staff was attentive but could have improved. Our waiter took our order but due to a technical \"glitch\" the system lost the order and he had to retake everyone's order (quite a while after placing the initial order). The cocktails were good but overpriced for the size. The food was good, one of the best steaks I've had in a while. I chose the 11 oz filet with Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese and cheesecake. They serve the steaks on a 500 degree plate and repeatedly inform you of how hot the plates are.  The lobster in the mac and cheese was a bit chewy but still tasty. The Caesar salad and cheesecake were both very good. 

Shortly after 10pm they turned all the lights on, essentially hinting to those still there that it's time to pack up and get out. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall it was a good meal but I came in expecting more out of such a well recognized name.  With the wide range of choices in Vegas I would definitely look at other options in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but there meal portions are somewhat small... I love their sweet potato casserole! It's so yummy, it's like a dessert!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse... I mean, you'd expect that if you're paying a pretty penny like this... Overall amazing."}
{"text":"garbage, no wonder this place closed. RIP ruth chris in vegas!"}
{"text":"Our Valentine's date at Ruth's Chris far exceeded our New Year's Eve experience at Fleming's. 

We started with crab stuffed mushrooms that was the tell all of how delicious our meal was going to be...mouthwatering and delicious. My wife and I both had the Valentine's Day special which included 2 lobster tails EACH, a steak and one side. My wife had the 6oz filet and I had the 8oz filet which were both cooked to order PERFECTLY and even seemed to get hotter in temperature the closer we cut to the middle. For our sides we chose the potatoes au gratin and creamy spinach - both amazing! We both had a glass of the Kenwood Merlot which was a smooth taste without the overbearing \"wood\" taste for all you non-regular red wine drinkers like me.

The service laid the groundwork for an exceptional experience. Our glasses were full, our food was hot and exactly what we ordered. She was genuinely friendly and her assistants were \"Johnny on the spot\" with everything. She capped her performance by bringing me the most delicious and generous complimentary birthday dessert! It was a small round chocolate cheese cake that had vanilla Haagen Dazs ice cream with strawberry sauce on the side and 3 pieces of pecan and walnut dark chocolate bark. See attached picture. We were also visited by the manager who was also genuinely friendly. It was all well worth the money and the 22% tip. No doubt we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Reviewing T-Bone Steak. 
By far the best steak I've ever had. Top quality meat seasoned and cooked absolutely perfectly. The steak was so good, I didn't bother with the bread or the two side dishes we ordered! Service is top shelf and expected in a place like this. If you've never been to a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you've got to try it. I highly recommend reservations. FYI: Restaurant is located in the run down Harrah's Casino, but they are a separate entity entirely. You take a special elevator to the second floor and when the door opens, you're in the restaurant. Windows all around. View of courtyard between the hotels is stunning. Neon everywhere, very Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I decided to eat unhealthy tonight, That is correct, you heard me UNHEALTHY. Where could I find an unhealthy meal? This should not be to hard I have many choices. Ah! a steakhouse is a good start. 

I knew I was off to a great start when I walked into the bar area to sit at a high table for two and I began breathing in a stream of second hand smoke. I looked over towards the bar to see who was assisting in my quest for an unhealthy meal. It was coming from a couple with matching bowling shirts at the end of the bar. She was blowing smoke like a broken radiator hose in a Mack truck. I am thinking this meal is going beyond unhealthy, it might kill me. 

The service was slow even though the place was not crowded. I ordered a glass of Chateau Ste. Michelle, Indian Reserve Cabernet. 
They actually poured a full 6 ounces in my glass.

My server finally showed up after a long wait and I ordered the large fillet and mushroom sides, knowing it would be prepared in lots of unhealthy butter. That is a Ruth Chris signature on steak preparation. Marinade it lots of butter and then pour more butter on top right before you serve it on an extremely hot plate. I was well on my way to having an unhealthy meal. 

The steak arrived on the white plate heated to ??? degrees. The steak was standing in a pool of butter and additional butter was jumping off the edges of the plate due to the sizzling effect. The large mushrooms were glistening from the butter coating and almost floating in the butter. Man, I am really living on the edge! 

The server warned me of the hot plate heated to ??? degrees and placed it 3\" from me on the table. I could feel the intense heat from the plate and I stared in amazement as the 200+ degree sizzling butter splattered onto my $125 shirt. I am now thinking not only will I eat unhealthy but I can trash one of my favorite shirts at the same time. 

I started in on the mushrooms and sure enough they tasted buttery. I liked the mushrooms, very tasty. The steak was cooked medium (pink in the center) and had a odd shape for a fillet. The steak tasted very average and actually had a few tough spots which is unusual for a center cut fillet. 

I finished up and felt that I had accomplished my goal of eating an unhealthy meal. I was all buttered up inside and out, thanks to the server putting the plate of spattering butter right next to me. My lungs were full of second hand smoke and I was on a red meat overdose. 

This is just another corporate steakhouse environment. Hit or miss on the food quality and not in the same league as the Ruth Chris in Annapolis, Md. As I write this review I am soaking the shirt I wore the other night to Ruth Chris in Wisk laundry detergent in an attempt to get the butter stain out. I might write a review about Wisk."}
{"text":"The fried calamari was terrific.  The entire meal was fantastic.  Our server was attentive and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"I made our reservations online a couple days in advanced. We were greeted immediately and sat right away. No wait time at all. The staff was very friendly and even remembered that we were on location for my boyfriends birthday earlier this month. For dinner I had water with fresh lemons, a peach mascato, the chilian sea bass, shared the lobster mac n cheese (side dishes are big enough to share), and the boyfriend had the ribeye steak. We were even surprised with a birthday treat for him which was raspberry cheese cake. Such a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on a Saturday night. The food was excellent but the service, not so much. I had the salmon with creamed spinach and he had the 8oz steak with mashed potatoes and we shared the lobster mac n cheese. We started h with one waiter and out of the blue, we ended up with a different waiter. The 1st waiter didn't go over any details like a nearby waiter did for her table. She was very engaged and detailed and he was just blah. There was no pass of or even a mention of a change in waiter. The new waiter didn't even introduce himself or even ask what we were drinking. He assumed that my husband was drinking Pepsi when it was actually root beer but he charged us for the drink he mistakenly brought out as well as the correct drink but I didn't even say anything; although I should have. He seemed to be in a rush and dropped my husband's silver on his sunglasses. He was was a sloppy mess with the rushing. I was quite disappointed in the level of customer service from these waiters."}
{"text":"Best steak I have had in Charlotte. Make sure to order the Chop Salad, too."}
{"text":"Food was very good, however service extremely poor. Nowhere near the service and quality of when the location was known as The Range Steakhouse. We attended for our anniversary, looking to take a photo on Strip,, as well as enjoy a special evening. Hostess could not find reservation, even though we made it the evening before in person. Hostess was equally rude and non responsive to request for seating, as too busy talking to another employee.  First two wines we attempted to order, out of stock.  When we finally attempted to order, the waitress was non existent to take food order. When food did come, side dish forgotten.. Photographer was to show up pre dinner, was no show until after dinner, and had mechanical error, so photo not available to next day for return trip. Total debacle = Total Rewards at this location. Food and location does not warrant the poor service and cost of this location. Skip it....."}
{"text":"Typical Ruth Chris and any other \"big steak\" and \"big side dish\" place. Not an attractive location. We are better off that it is closed."}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite steakhouse so we go here a few times a year.  We are never disappointed!  This time we had the veal ravioli for an appetizer, mozzarella/tomato salad, a New York strip, and cappuccino and banana cream pie for desert.  The food was excellent and the view of the strip at night was stunning.  We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very classy, quiet, all the waiters & Waitresses have great knowledge of the menu, drinks. You get to choose your preferred knife for your steak, all the food is cooked to perfection and tasted great. The wine selection is fantastic, the bar offers many handcrafted cocktails along with a decent craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several different Ruth's Chris establishments and I know that when you travel you should go experiment on something new. But this time I was looking for something nice and familiar and I knew Ruth's wasn't going to let me down. And it didn't. 

Excellently prepared steak, the green beans were just how I like them and the sweet potato souffle was ... well, damn near perfect.

Exploration is always fun but sometimes you gotta stick to tried and true - even if you are gonna pay thru the nose! LOL"}
{"text":"Love love this place.  It is my favorite steak place by far.  It is pricey , but worth it.  I used to be a well done steak person , now I get it medium.  Ruth Chris did that to me.  Ruth Chris is by far better than Durant's, Arrowhead Steak , and Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak.   I try others but they are never as good.  The service is always excellent.  

Drinks are excellent too.  The New Fashioned is so good if you like Whiskey.  Also, the Manhattan Eastside is to die for.  So smooth and yummy.

So if you are thinking of trying a high end steak place, select Ruth Chris. Also, they seem to always participate in restaurant week.  So if your on budget , go in September during Restaurant week (http://arizonarestaurantweek.com/restaurants/all-restaurants/) when they have the $44.00  dinner.  I only wish they had not moved from Camelback to Scottsdale.  I need one on the west side!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to A LOT of Ruth's Chris restaurants and I have to say I've been to this location twice and it's been disappointing both times. Each time we had reservations and were stuck in a side room that DID NOT look like the rest of the restaurants and servers who seemed to be wishing they were in the other part of the restaurant jut like we were. IF I had to recommend one thing I would recommend going to the Uptown location and leave this one alone."}
{"text":"I'd heard many good things about Ruth's Chris Steak House but having never been there, I didn't know if I could believe what was said or not. I decided to take my friend there for his birthday and \"check it out\". I chose the location on Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale AZ. I'd made a reservation and when I realized we'd be late, I called to let them know. 

Here's where my experience began: I was surprised with their response - they were courteous and encouraged me to come regardless of how late we would be since they were open until 10pm. As long as we arrived by 10pm, they would be happy to serve us. 

Wow! That's different, I thought...

We arrived - at 9:45pm - and we were greeted warmly and welcomed enthusiastically.  There was no one else in the dining area, so it was more like a private dinner. The Hostess seated us at the table of our choice and was conversational without monopolizing our time. She was professional and very friendly. Our server came to the table and when my birthday guest apologized for our tardiness, he was told that it was no problem at all. \"The important thing is that you have a wonderful birthday and enjoy yourself. We are here for you tonight.\" YES, that is what he said AND his attitude and actions backed up his words.

Wow - Again!!

Our whole evening was wonderful.  What I want to say is that my experience at Ruth's Chris Steak House was, by far, the best I've ever had at a steak house. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. The steak practically melted in our mouths and the shrimp was superb. 

I highly recommend this steak house to anyone desiring to have a relaxed evening with delicious food and excellent friendly service.

I look forward to my next visit..."}
{"text":"Your steak comes sizzling on a pan with butter and is served in front of you. The taste and tenderness of the steak was incredible and it left me wanting to lick the plate clean.

Price of the foot was pretty high and you had to buy all your dishes separately. If you are going to go, make sure you put away your doubts and bring out your credit card. It'll cost you some money but you won't regret a thing.

Key lime Pie and cheese cake at the end to finish off the meal was delicious!"}
{"text":"My friends living in Madison took me to Ruths Chris for happy hour when i visited. This place is first class but is rather pricey. Happy hour is not pricey and the food is delicious!

we had appetizers (seared ahi, tempura veggies, a FANTASTIC chopped salad and shrimp in a creamy sauce)and they were all half price during happy hour. well drinks were five dollars! you cant beat that deal with a stick.

the bartender was well known by everyone in the bar. i do not recall his name but he is the type that meets you once and remembers your name and what you drink (i wish i could say the same thing!) a very  nice touch is that the bartender has a pair of reader's glasses for us old folks that have a hard time reading the bill and didnt bring our readers lol

i had a blast and this spot was awesome! this is as good as it gets"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Ruth's Chris at Harrah's in over a year even though I have always enjoyed dinners there. This time was no exception. The evening started a little slow as our waiter was busy with the manager over something. Once we did get things started (about a ten+ minute wait even after we asked for the waiter) service was excellent. The mozzarella and tomato salad is large enough to split, which my wife and I did. I tried the bone in NY steak rather than my usual rib eye and was not disappointed. It was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My wife ordered the stuffed chicken breast and would not do that again. She said it was all cheese. She wished she had just ordered a petite filet which she has enjoyed in the past. One disappointment was that when they revamped their menu about a year ago they removed Lyonnaise potatoes which I love. Half the reason for choosing between steak restaurants in Las Vegas is the side dishes since they all have great steaks. I expressed my disappointment to the manager when he came by to ask how everything was and he told me that if I informed them I wanted Lyonnaise potatoes when I make my next reservation, they will have them available for me. That is great customer service and I will take them up on their offer. Our out of town visitors had the filet and the shrimp entrée and both were pleased. The French fries were good but not Lyonnaise potatoes and the creamed spinach was excellent. I can't comment on dessert as we've never had room for it on any of our visits but they do look good. The steaks and the service coupled with The Strip view still make this is my favorite Ruth's Chris location."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on... service, drinks, food, all of it. Andy took care of me & he is truly exceptional. The drinks he made for me were delicious & the perfect balance of sweet & strong. It's definitely the best service I've had at any restaurant in downtown Cleveland. My filet was incredible, a perfect medium rare. I was even impressed by the bread basket! Also, I just have to say that the ladies room was just gorgeous. It was decorated so beautifully. If you're looking for a memorable night in downtown Cleveland make this your stop & ask for Andy to be your bartender/server. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dollieanne was absolutely amazing!!! Great service great steak absolutely perfect, almost went to steakhouse in MGM but so happy we decided on this one so perfect great staff, super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Significant other decided to spoil me with dinner here. She had made resos beforehand which allowed us to walk right in and sit down upon arrival. 

The vibe here was really nice. Very sophisticated and classy. Very mature as well. Not a child in sight when we attended. Interior decor somewhat dated but very clean and well prepped. 

The food. Amazing. I ordered chicken (I know, who orders chicken at a steak house?), but I wasn't feeling too good, which was a bummer. Anyways, it was enormous. 2 full chicken breasts smothered in their heavenly sauce. It was incredible. The sides here, also enormous. You have to order the sides extra (mashed potatoes) were enough to feed 3 people. 

Overall I was impressed. Service was prompt and knowledgable, my server knew her alcoholic beverages well, pretty impressive actually. Although I am not a regular here, I will definitely be back for more. Next time I promise to get the steak!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!!! I didn't think it would be as nice as it was. The restaurant had strip views and also carnival court views. The customer service was great!!! I had one awesome dinner.. went with the fillet and it was super yummy. I will defeco back again!... and I live here."}
{"text":"Made my reservation at 8:15 and did not get seated till 8:45 and that's with the diamond card.  The place wasn't even crowded.  For a nice place, the service sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Fun, delicious, relaxing and friendly but the food was even better.  The Chilean Sea Bass was amazing.  The side dishes were wonderful.   I love a great salad, the Harvest Salad was delicious.  Our server was delightful   Yes, we usually don't spend so much on dinner but I didn't complain because the quality and the whole experience was so wonderful."}
{"text":"I think the Chef that night was a person that has tourettes and a salt shaker and I bet you he was singing, \"let me FRICK see your AHH salt shaker\" as he was cooking.

Salty like a salt lick. Eeee haw...

Amongst 6 girls we got 3 summer special. It includes: 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides and 1 dessert for about $90 bucks.

Salad- Good. 5 Stars.
Creamed spinach- 3 Stars.
Filet- Burnt. 3 Stars.
Mashed Potatoes- 5 Stars
Mushrooms- Soooo salty! 0 Stars.
Free range chicken- 5 Stars.

The entree choices were: fish, filet, some other stuff and some other stuff. But the best bang for your buck was the mixed grill entree choice. The mixed grill comes with a filet (4 oz), free range chicken, and a crab cake. I would say go for the mixed grill instead of just choosing a fish or filet (6 oz) entree."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant on Open Table for our 12th Wedding Anniversary.

All I can say is I'm glad I did!

When we arrived and gave the hostess our name for the reservation she immediately welcomed us with a \"Happy Anniversary\". I thought this was awesome since I didn't even speak in person with anyone at the restaurant. I just mentioned it in the notes when booking the reservation on-line.

I also arranged flowers to be delivered to the restaurant ahead of time and as expected, they were there waiting on our table as we were seated. Not only did they have the flowers ready, the decorated the table with sparkly anniversary confetti and there was a greeting card from the restaurant wishing us a happy anniversary as well. Truly above and beyond!

Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived till we left some two hours later. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere not as pretentious as I was expecting. It was \"fancy\" but still felt friendly and cozy.

The food was truly incredible and plentiful. We ordered the ribeye and the filet. I recommend you try the sweet potato casserole too. To die for! At the end, we were so full that we had to take leftovers home.

And also because it was our anniversary, they bought our dessert and coffee.

As we paid our bill, the waitress also validated our parking.

I highly recommend this restaurant and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo overrated if you ask me!! I've been twice. The 1st time was my 1st \"upscale dining\" experience a few years ago right after I graduated college. I wasn't that impressed. I thought the steak was average at best. But still hearing all the hype around it, I thought, well maybe its because its the 1st time i've paid this much for food, the price turned me off. But no... the next time I tried was during Charlotte Restaurant Week. We ordered the Calamari appetizer, it was delicious but a small portion for the table. So needing a little more we ordered another one. This time it was 3 times the size of the 1st plate. If they had gave us that plate 1st, we wouldn't have ordered 2. That inconsistency was annoying. Then we got our steak entrees... and having been to multiple upscale steak houses by this point in my life... I determined it wasn't me, it was them. The steak just didn't impress me. So I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger and knew it would be good, but I had no idea it would be that tasty! Incredible, given the low price, as compared to other places. 

A great experience comes from the staff though and they were phenomenal. They were very helpful and accommodating to my son. I bought a few hundred dollars of gift cards while there and look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is definitely one of the better chains of the world. It is very consistent and will always provide a solid meal. I ordered the Chillean Sea Bass with a side of shrimp which were very tasty. They were richly soaked in butter and had a lemon juice on them as well. Both items were delicious. The service was a little bit slow, and the prices are very hefty for the quality. The sides are good too, but pricy. Our server also somewhat deceived us by offering us sides in a way that seemed like our entrees came with a side, and he offered us sides. We ordered the sides and they added up on the bill largely, not a classy move by the server. Other than that it was good. This was a very nice location, as I have been to many other of these restaraunts and this is the best set up one I have seen yet. Overall I would recommend, but only if you are willing to spend a good chunk of cash."}
{"text":"Mississauga location is convenient next to square one shopping mall. 
Friendly staff quick to please.  Manager checks on guest attentively. 
We had the 
Lobster bisque (is nice but still prefer Zoup)
Chop salad (coleslaw style with English dressing)
Harvest salad (a must order)
ribeye 16 oz medium well.  
Love The best Blue crab cakes $38
The Porterhouse steak bone in 40 oz medium 
Served with plates of melted butter

Kids menu ($20 items) were nice for kids too (steak too)
Au gratin (cheese melted over potato slices scallop style) serves 4
Shoestring fries crispy 
Sautéed mushrooms 
Yummy fudge chocolate cake 
Perfect cappuccinos. 

Tables are well spaced apart.  You don't feel like other tables are nudging you.
Service is great and attentive.  
They even split the soup portions for my wife and I to share, without asking. Salads were perfect.  Butter for the bread super buttery and creamy.  Steaks cooked to perfection. 
We took 21/2 for dinner and didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"Is there another steakhouse? I think not, and let me tell you why. This is my favorite Ruth's Chris in the country. It's a company owned store who features the outrageous banana cream pie specialty desert, which many other stores discontinued because it's too time consuming to make. The food is exceptional, included during happy hour. Whether you're in the mood for a prime steak, creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes or a prime cheeseburger with hand cut fries, you will not be disappointed. But really what goes beyond the food and the atmosphere, is the service. One server is better than the next. Each is professional, courteous, and just like their prime steaks - fabulous. I'd highly recommend this Ruth's Chris to anyone. It's a shining example of how restaurants should treat their customers."}
{"text":"I can't imagine that this venerated old steakhouse needs any further review but here I am. Great service, I mean really truly attentive service. Lovely ambience and a menu that cannot be beat. The price is ridiculous ($52 for a cowboy rib-eye) but absolutely delicious. The steaks are amazingly prepared and the sides are served family style. We tried three different salads and they were all good. We shared the lyonnaise potatoes, which were cooked to crispy perfection and the steamed asparagus with hollandaise. Good hollandaise too. We skipped out on dessert this time and shared a little wine instead. Lovely, perfect, delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. (twice) And was exactly that, happy. Wonderful food, tasty drinks, a pretty view and to top it off Ceasar as our waiter. What a treat. 
Our other experiences here on the strip with food, value and service has not compared."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Ruth's Chris and it was good.  I wasn't blown away by anything, but food, service, and atmosphere were all solid.  We had a party of three, plus an infant.  They didn't have a carseat sling, but an extra chair was offered and worked fine.  I believe Orlando was our server and he was great. Very personable, though we briefly had a hard time finding him a little further into the meal.
Ordered the calamari as an appetizer and that was quite good. Cooked perfectly, we cleaned the plate!  Each of us got the classic, which is a combo of sorts.  Two of us chose the filet topped with shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes, the third has stuffed chicken breast with garlic mashed potatoes. The steaks were cooked just right, as they should be since they're a famous steakhouse.  The chicken was juicy but the stuffing was lackluster and kind of blended with the chicken in an unappetizing way.  Potatoes were good, light and covered with butter.  We also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese which was large enough to split 3 ways!  Good stuff.  The Classics came with dessert, which was cheesecake and ice cream.  It was perfect. Just enough to end the meal.
Cocktails were tasty, which makes me happy. I had the Big Easy Hurricane. It's no Pat O'Briens, but what is?  The Raspberry Rosemary Cosmo was pretty delicious as well.  Get that.
All in all it was just a solid performance.  I would like to go back and try some different dishes.  I can at least recommend the place."}
{"text":"This Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is the busiest of all of their many locations (if I heard it explained correctly).  It is located inside Harrah's casino, and has a beautiful view (especially in the evening) of the Las Vegas Blvd and The Forum Shop across the street from the bar and most of the dining area.

To get to the restaurant look for the pair of elevators with the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse signage nearby. If you can't locate it,I am sure one of the Harrah's staff will be happy to provide direction or perhaps even escort you there.

(Disclaimer)  I was at this Ruth's Chris Steakhouse recently for a private function, therefore I will primarily limit my comments on the service, food, and overall dining experience.

First, the decor and overall ambiance was very pleasant.  The lighting is dim, not conducive to food photography (unless you have really good camera gears that are capable of low light photography), as you don't want to disturb other guests with your flash photography.  But the view of the Strip and automobiles and pedestrians below is almost hypnotic.  (4.5/5)

The staff that waited on us were a good group.  Rene our server was exceptional, and was knowledgeable about the menu, including details not printed on the menu, as well as the trivia about the oven temperature for preparing steaks (1,800 degrees) and warming the plates that the steaks and most other entrees are served on (500 degrees for the plate, so don't get burn).  (5/5)

Highlights of their menu:

Cowboy (USDA Prime Beef Bone-In) Ribeye.  If you love a good steak cooked to your desired doneness, they have excellent steaks.  Portion size is 22 oz, including the bone.

Caesar Salad:  Very common in most restaurants, but they prepared a really good one here.  (4.5/5)

Seafood Gumbo.   A milder version of the gumbo that will suit the palette of most guests. I personally like my seafood gumbo with more kick, at least from the Andouille sausage and seasoning.  (3.5/5)

Barbecued Shrimp.  Used barbecue spices in the sauce (which is very delicious and would go great with the breads from the bread basket), but the Jumbo Gulf shrimp is sauteed not grilled.  (4.5/5)

Sweet Potato Casserole.  Of the sides we ordered (French Fries, would be better if it was double fried or more crispy; Creamed Spinach, no complaints; Potatoes Au Gratin, no complaints), the Sweet Potato Casserole was the only one we completely finished.  It is sweet, has a nice crunchy crust, and I liked it with my entree, but could also enjoy it as a substitute of their normal dessert options.  (5/5)

Banana Cream Pie.  Generous portion, easily shared with 2-4 dining companions, if you even have room to spare after a steak dinner.  

Overall, everyone at the table was extremely happy with the service, food and had a blast.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in many Ruth Chris Steak Houses all over the country and this one is by far the worst we have ever been in.  The service was good, the food was average and the setting in a second rate casino was very poor, very unlike other RC we have been to over many years, we will not go back."}
{"text":"Quality is equal of The Keg...Just not worth the price....
(Steak 44 is about the same price and blows this place out of the water btw)"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here with my beloved hubby It's cool because we order the same menus every time, it reminds us of Hawaii because it's the same exact things we order there haha! I love their ambiance here. Since this very branch has been here for 3 decades already which gives it a way more classic and romantic vibes, in my taste ^_^  Their food is divine! Marissa is also a nice server, very fun and you can see the passion in her for her job which is important. 
This is like 45 minutes ride away from our home but it's all worth it! Greatly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here for a webinar conference.  We had a restricted menu that started with the salad with balsamic vinaigrette with bread.  I got the petite filet creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes.  I was allergic to the deserts that were offered so I got chocolate ice cream.  So on with the review.  It was delicious and fantastic and i really enjoyed the meal.  The webinar was great and they had a nice set up.  I have no idea how much this place costs but I understand it is expensive.  I was excited to get this all for free.  Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Even though their restaurant is nice and upscale I was not impressed by their filet mignon!  It was barely seasoned! I can set say I've had better! (Papadeaux)"}
{"text":"Please make sure to try out the spicy lobster when visiting! The food was great and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Prime Rib melts in your mouth. I like the idea you can order the thickness of your meat and cut  right in front of you. The prices on the menu of this restaurant is well worth your dining experience. The service is great. The location is off the strip so you are not rushed and can actually enjoy a nice dining experience with anyone, Family or just friends."}
{"text":"We came in late (around 945 pm) and they were as accommodating as ever!!! Caesar is by far and away one of the best servers I've ever had... His recommendations and attentiveness was unparalleled!!! Thanks! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously?  small portions for ridiculous prices..quote from our server \" we don't do small here'....my entree salad as big (as small) as my husband's? dinner salad...there was actually more dressing than salad smothered all over it..I also ordered a side of broccoli..two crowns for $9... service was good..so if u don't mind paying..have at it."}
{"text":"My significant other chose this restaurant to celebrate our 4 years together because he had heard really great things about this place , we had a late dinner reservation so by the time we got there it wasn't busy ... at all. The food was amazing from the appetizer to the dessert however the service was mediocre... Rachael did not bother to make small talk or even ask how we were doing . When ever she would come to our table to ask how the food was we couldn't get past great before she was walking away. It took 30 minutes alone to order our dessert... i would understand this behavior if she was slammed but we were her only table ..  for such a nice restaurant you would expect better service"}
{"text":"Nothing Special

Went here for a dinner date, and was not impressed. First of all the decor is really boaring, for such a fancy/expensive place. The steak it self was good, but I've had better at lower end restaurants. Will not be returning..."}
{"text":"Forgot to write them up after our visit in October.  I have eaten at several RC's and this one takes the cake for service and quality of food.  Hit most of them in every major city and wasn't planning on eating dinner here.  It was dumb luck as my wife didn't want to walk anymore and wanted food immediately.  Lucky for me we were in front of Harrah's.  Walked right in and had the best experience at a RC yet.  Way to go folks in Vegas.  

Locations I have eaten at are:

Annapolis, Atlantic City, Anaheim, DC (don't go to that one), San Francisco, San Diego, Orlando (thought the folks there were a little racist), Chicago (there are better steak houses than RC in Chicago), St. Louis, Midtown NYC, Charlotte, PDX and Seattle to name a few.  Business trips are nice for eating at good restaurants.

Don't like to give out 5-stars as the establishment can't go up from there.  But in this case it was deserving."}
{"text":"Ate here before the Panther game last Sunday. They were understaffed and the service was Terrible!!! Took 30 minuets to get a beer and even longer for food. I would stay away from RC on game day."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location, second floor with a view.

We had a private room for 20 people to celebrate family birthdays in April and May and happen to be during restaurant week.

Our servers handled our party with ease and professionally with class.

I ordered the restaurant week special that came with Tomato Soup with Crab, 12 oz Petite Ribeye and Chocolate Cake.

The Tomato Soup had a little kick to it but was very tasty. The Ribeye has awesome, served medium rare as ordered and definitely cooked on butter the way it is supposed to be. It was topped off with the Double Chocolate Cake. With the birthdays, we're given a creme brulee and a cheesecake which both were exceptional. 

Can't praise the exceptional experience enough, food, service and private room.

Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The bartenders who make me feel special the food which is top notch. Prime beef cooked to temp and served on a sizzling plate drenched in butter ... O M G!  Heaven on earth. 

Why 5 stars?  Because of the one time the food was not top notch.  Eating in the dining room with my wife and had ordered the large filet.  It was fine  but had one smallish portion of it that was a bit fatty/gristly.  I left that part on the plate but had had plenty of good medium-rare steak to be fully satisfied.  Our waiter came up and saw the small pile and asked if everything was  ok.  I just said there was this little bit that wasn't good but that it was no problem at all.  Next thing we know the Executive Chef is at the table profusely apologizing, saying that cut should not have gone out.  The steak is off the bill and we got two free desserts.  All without really having a complaint.  THAT is commitment to quality and customer loyalty."}
{"text":"I've been turned off to Ruth's Chris by lousy franchises in New York, New Jersey, and California, but this one is excellent.  We had it all to ourselves on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"I didn't think there could be another steak house that is just as good as Durant or a Different Point of View until now. 

The restaurant is located at the 2nd floor of a plaza and I believe it was relocated from camelback a year ago. The exterior is not much to look at. However, the interior is beautifully decorated. Hostesses were friendly & well dressed. The tables are well layout with different plates, folks & knives (talk about elegant). Our waiter showed up shortly after we were seated introducing us their menus & different variety of drinks. It took my 2nd try to actually like the white wine that I picked. Not once he gave me any sort of an attitude and was being extremely patient with me finding the right wine to go with the meal. When we were ready to order the entrée, he highly recommended me to order the filet mignon. My friend ordered the chef special with a lobster Mac & Cheese. There was a bit of a wait to get our meals & our waiter never stopped keeping us posted on the progress. When the plates finally arrived, they were still hot until I had my last bite. The portion was just right for me and it was juicy and delicious. Nevertheless, it didn't taste nearly as good as the chef special. It was well seasoned with big portion. Every bite has a lot of flavor in it. I was extremely full, but still manage to make room for desserts. I ordered the ice-cream with two different flavor (vanilla and chocolate) & a cheese cake. It was a perfect way to end the meal. If you like coffee with liquor in it, they have them on the menus also. 

We walked out of here feeling full and happy. It was definitely a romantic setting for a date night. Food was great and service was outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try a nice steak and date night. 

P.S. I really wish they would have prime rib in their menu. I guess I'll have to go to Durant for that. Side dishes are not included with your entrée. Be prepared to spend some serious $$$ here."}
{"text":"Great service and staff. Food is subpar for the price. $100 lobster came out cold, and was chewy. Sent it back to have it warmed up and still came back cold---I was like \"really\". Ribeye was good, it wasn't $50 good though. Mushrooms lacked any flavor and the bread they serve you when you're seated was a .50 loaf of generic bread. If it wasn't for the pleasant hostess and waiter, I'd give this place like 1-2 stars. Would t go back, simply because the food was not up to par."}
