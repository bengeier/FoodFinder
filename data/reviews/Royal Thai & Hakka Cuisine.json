{"text":"Big fan...incredibly authentic and fragrant.  I ordered the Red Curry Chicken and the Peanut Red Curry Chicken with coconut rice.  These dishes were incredibly creamy, delicious and on point with the spiciness.  If you want the real deal, this is the place for Thai and Hakka."}
{"text":"This place get a 2.5 star for their food. I have had better hakka dishes at other places. But their service deserves 1 star. They brought the rice and noodles first. Then i waited 5-7 minutes for my chicken items. I asked and was told they are making it. Then once the rice and noodles was cold, the chicken comes out. And they forgot 1 other chicken item. So now i have to wait longer for the other gravy item. The old lady is rude and makes it feel like she is doing a favour serving. And we were the only people in the restaurant. So imagine if they get busy. I am never going there again and will never recommend anyone about this place. Lots of other hakka choices."}
{"text":"So we absolutely loved Go For Thai which used to be here. And were sad they were renovating but willing to wait. When we learned it was a new owner we gave them a chance and ordered the same kind of dishes we used to order from Go For Thai. They were so disappointing we've thrown out their menu and will never eat here again. The pad Thai curry was 100 times spicier and super dry. No juiciness like the other one. So blah on your mouth other than the spice. The green curry beef was worse. Seemed more fatty and the beef tastes weird and again it's 200 times spicier than before. The coconut rice is gummy. And the plain rice is boring. We also got a steamed chicken dumpling for my son. The \"chicken\" is unrecognizable as food and the peanut sauce it comes with is so gross and tastes stale. I literally threw out the whole 35 dollar meal. Don't go here."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The lunch specials were fairly priced and look typical of other Hakka restaurants i have eaten at in Toronto. I ordered the Chilli Chicken lunch special. The portion was decent, although the rice portion was small the chilli chicken did have much flavour. There was decent spice but there was something missing with the sauce, kind of blah."}
{"text":"Awesome staff- remembers me and my usual order every time! Great food- love the green chicken curry"}
