{"text":"This was the worst pizza I have ever had! Purchased a Chicken Club slice and it was dry and tasteless. I was better off going hungry."}
{"text":"Can I give this place a minus star rating. Please heed my warnings. The pizzas weren't good at this location. Not all Ginos are bad."}
{"text":"WOW. Worst pizza experience ever. We will never order from this location again. Poor quality food. Poor service. and language barrier. We are very disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be really good. But now toppings are rarely used and it's too much bread. Barely a pizza"}
{"text":"NOPE. NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN. 
SO. We ordered at 7:36pm. Honestly we were starving. The pizza couldnt get here fast enough. Our order was confirmed and said 45 mins. 
We live in a condo so most delivery people don't like coming upstairs so I sent my husband down around the 40 minute mark so he could wait. Long story short my husband waited until the 1hr mark to come upstairs. No one showed. So I called customer service and was asking what our status was. He called the store to find out. We were out on a 12 minute hold just waiting... So the pizza says there's a fire Alarm and he can't get up the elevator. Let me tell you there was absolutely no fire alarm and my husband was waiting downstairs anyways. So the driver comes back just passed the hour and a half mark. I told him that he should have called us or talked to concierge if he had any issues and he told me to take my pizza and go .. so now I got $10 off my cold pizza which we waited double the time for and got told to get lost because he had no manners.... not impressed."}
