{"text":"My partner and I went here on a date night to try it out. The restaurant appearance looks great but the food...not so much. We ordered the nachos with ground beef...they were DISGUSTING. I think they used liquid cheese and the chilli tasted like it was from a can...waste of money. We also ordered the wings, which were actually pretty good. We were served by a waitress who's uniform was trashy- her ass cheeks were sticking out. There were families there. I would never go back there. ever."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We enjoyed. Waitress was so pleasant. The place left a good memory."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience my girlfriend and I have ever experienced!   We ordered chicken Thai bites as an appetizer and after we had eaten most of them we cut the last one in half to share it and noticed that it was completely raw inside. We didn't notice the others because of how much sauce was on them but this totally wrecked our appetite. When we brought it to the attention of the restaurant owner all he said was that he was sorry and that he would take that dish off of our bill!! He also said that if we feel sick that we should go directly to the hospital. NOT the kind of thing you want to hear from the people making  your food!  I would have expected him to cover the entire cost of our meal!  This is a disgrace and we will never return to this restaurant. I would never recommend anybody go here!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST Shoeless Joes location. STAY AWAY! The service is absolutely horrible! And the food as well! Went with a group of people we all ordered wings with sauce on them, the sauce was drizzled on, there was barely anything on them! And the wings were so dry as well! If we wanted plain wings we would have asked for that instead! Service is horrible and so are wait times...the place was empty afterwards and we were waiting for our bill and the waitresses were all too busy laughing with each other and another customer was getting angry and went to get them to pay their bill as well. We went there when it first opened and it was horrible, decided never to go back, but we did and decided to give it another chance hoping things have chances  and nothing has changed...STAY AWAY! I would give it 0 stars but the app made me give it at least one, it doesn't even deserve that."}
{"text":"The place was very close to where I was staying during my last stay in Toronto. Great sports bar. A lot of TVs with different sports, not only hokey... The music is maybe a bit too loud, but as I was by myself it was ok. I took their Redonkulous Burger. The menu says ''we double dare you to finish it''. It is a burger with 2 patties, bacon, and their pretzel bread (which is why I chose it in fact). It was very good. No choice of cooking, but good. I had their house sweet potatoes fries with it, very good too. The only down point is the waiting time. It took more than 20min to get my food. I was watching soccer, so it was ok, but....... Will probably be back if in the neighborhood and the mood. Decent value for money. 35$ before tips."}
{"text":"Although they have a huge menu I have only tried some of their appetizers and every time I come back I get the same thing. The Richards 5 Cheese Dip is the best thing ever, only come here for that. I've tried their appetizer platter which includes the chicken bites, pita and dip, calamari and one more thing cannot remember. We as a group finished the whole thing as well as their quesadilla, so good.  The reason why I have this location 4 stars is because the customer service. The servers and the hostess at the front seem so unwelcoming and always seem bothered when I approach for things they've missed, like utensils."}
{"text":"We were in Brampton for the fist time. Our hotel recommended this place and we couldn't have been happier. We went 3 times. The food was very flavorful and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Service was quite good. I ordered the maple salmon.  Eeeehhh. Can't expect too much ordering seafood in a sports bar. For what it is?. Pleasant.  Friendly.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"completely disappointed today with the service - called at 3pm yesterday to ask if they were playing sound at the bar to watch the game and i was told yes.. showed up today and spoke to the manager on duty Amit and he said he can't please everyone and that he could play it for a but the minute he gets a complaint he's turning it off.  this isn't the first time this has happened, i came for the last game against the rangers - called in advance and they told me the sound would be on - get there and i get the same story.   i told Amit i'd rather spend he money at their establishment than go to boston pizza and he pretty much he told me to leave so i did."}
{"text":"This sports bar is very cool with TVs everywhere. Prices aren't bad at all but the food is not that food. I ordered some fried calamari and they taste a little weird like when you cook with really old oil. I also ordered the flat bread pizza which was very good, but they didn't have my first choice of mushrooms."}
{"text":"2 stars for the quality of food and drink I had over here, but it escapes the 2 star review because it works well as a sports bar and I appreciated the service. Not only is it clean, comfortable and well stocked with flat screens hanging around, each booth has a TV screen (while not large it's definitely sufficient for the close viewing experience) and the volume goes high enough to be heard by the furthest person in the booth but not high enough to bleed in to neighboring seats.   Service was quick and my server was very friendly, something which I don't remember encountering on my visit to one of their downtown locations, so that was a pleasant surprise. This location is only a couple of months old, so I would expect that service would only be more streamlined.   I ordered a sirloin and for $19.99 it came well stocked with all sorts of stuff, two of which I was able to customize, one of the add-ons I wanted was quinoa, big mistake! I should have known better than to expect a vegetarian restaurant quality quinoa to be served here, it just fell short of tasting like dried rice and my steak was mediocre. But I really should not complain too much since I wasn't hit hard on my wallet by this dish, but I feel like I could have gotten a \"safer\" meal for a few dollars less and be satisfied.  I ordered a manhattan and was given the Shoeless Joes version of a manhattan, I'm not sure what changes they make to the original manhattan recipie but it just seemed to me like they just gave me a whiskey and ginger ale. So I would advice against that. I know I could have just been unlucky and ordered the one drink on their menu that's not that great, I was told that the bartender was new as well so that was also probably a factor.   I would come here again but not for dinner, but for a beer to catch a game I can't find too much fault with this location. If anything, it seemed to attract a few families which I found weird given that the Applebee's next door is more family oriented."}
{"text":"First the good:  lots of TV screens, with most tuned to hockey. Now, the bad:  Tap beer selection is all swill. I ordered the Baja Chicken sandwich with savory rice. The chicken was 1/3 the size of the bun, and the bun was small. After rearranging, it became a slider. Flavorless. The rice tasted better."}
{"text":"Cool sports bar atmosphere and a lot of tv screens. Wait time was a bit on the longer side, around 20 mins or so which I didn't appreciate since it was a bit of a dead Weds. night. Our waitress was nice but the food was mediocre. I got the vegetarian nachos which were dry as ever! No cheese at the bottom and pretty much just tasteless. The guac looked like a pre-made pur√©e or something. My boyfriend got the Lumberjack burger and he didn't really enjoy his food either with the exception of the fries (you can't really screw up fries lol).   I think i'd go back again to watch a game but I'd definitely try something different to  eat."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and grab a beer. The food is average. We got wings and the flatbread and it was good but not great. The service was spotty as well. We would order another beer and it would take 5-10 minutes to get it and the place was not very busy. The beer selection is not all that great either. Very general selection."}
{"text":"Sad to see that people are rating this place low.  Went for Wing night, server in the bar (young black girl) was super friendly & attentive.  Service was quick, food was hot and great!  2lbs of wings, sweet potato fries and garden salad.  I didn't finish my spring mix salad b/c it had some distasteful leaves in them.  The server noticed and had the Manager come right out and he offered to take off the bill.  No questions asked.   Menu options have def'ly increased and have become better than before.  Great atmosphere to watch a game or just hang out for a bite."}
{"text":"Went in for drinks tonight... Kitchen was 'backed up' and the wait was about an hr for food, but that was fine as we had eaten earlier and were after drinks before our movie. Drinks were delicious, service prompt & friendly. No complaints, we will return to try the food."}
{"text":"Food was not enjoyable. Service was not at all helpful. Why would you ask how was everything???  If you don't care.  Waste of time, waste of money."}
{"text":"The food is improperly made. Staff is bad. The owner is a first timer, and it shows with how the restaurant is run..wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food, disappointed with price and quality.   Ordered the hamburger( which was on the small side. At $15 I expect a decent burger.  What I received was  a small, overcooked piece of ground beef. It was about as big as a quarter pounder at McD's (see picture).  Burger was overcooked to the point of being very dry.  French Onion soup at $8 was a real disappointment.  For that price I expect a decent bowl of French onion soup.  What I got was more like a very thickened beef stock with lots of little pieces of onion, a few croutons, covered in some sort of cheap cheese.  Think a very thick onion gravy.  Would have been better if it were used for poutine gravy(see picture).  Came in a small square bowl.  I'm guessing 8oz. total. So, for $8 it was overpriced and lacked the quality.   Small side salad was ok.  There are much better places for a burger, or onion soup.  They will stay in business due to the hotel across the parking lot and it's a sports bar with TV's at every booth and table.  If you want to have a beer it's a decent sports bar.  If you want decent food at a decent price go somewhere else.  $30 for a burger and soup, including $5 tip."}
{"text":"I've been to this location once before, over a year ago, I believe. I found the food to be lacklustre then, and sadly, my experience this past weekend was no better.   I thought it would be fair to give the restaurant another shot, so my husband and I arrived early enough in the evening before our movie. Although our waitress was very friendly, the food once again was mediocre.   I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with a side salad, and my husband ordered the New York steak. My wrap was alright overall, but my husband was less than enthused about his steak as he found it very bland. My drink was made incorrectly the first time, but the waitress did replace it promptly.   I suppose it's a good place to watch sports as there are many televisions running, but it just misses the mark with their food, the rundown bathrooms, and the very persistent fruit flies that hovered over our table despite it being the dead of winter."}
{"text":"Flies all over the place  so bad we could not eat   but they did give us our money back"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have had at supposed sports pub/resteraunt. Our server took forever to wait on us, having to be assisted by a different waitress. Still waiting on soup which I am guessing is not made to order and definitely shouldn't take this long. The waitress didn't write anything down which is probably why I got a draft beer instead of the bottle I asked for, and I can't even imagine how bad or long it will take to the burger."}
