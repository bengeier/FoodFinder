{"text":"First time here started off with no line, by the time we left, drive through and inside lines were full.  Burger was ok, veggies were fresh, loved the sauce and fries. I drive by here a lot, would stop for the fries. Also, wish I had known the corn is seasonal.    Why the 3? Service. It was our first time and it was obvious, felt more like the lady ready to take our order just wanted to get it over with and us out of the way.  Like I said no line when we got there, not inside and 1 car at the drive thru.  The 4-5 will depend on service next time."}
{"text":"From previous reviews I was expecting a pretty good tastey burger. I went through drive thru and ordered the standard burger with cheese. I had to wait around 5 mins...no big deal, I want fresh food. The burger was huge and had double patties. Everything about it was bland. The burger tasted purely like grease, the lettuce tasted dirty and it was just plain gross. I'm new to the area and really wanted to try out and support local businesses, however this place  will not get my support. My stomach felt queezy the rest of the evening, I'm sure due to the abundance of grease. It dripped from the burger and every bite just seemed like a bland  deep fryer mess. In and out and Culvers have way better burgers for much less. I paid 6.00 for just the burger here and I would pay more if it was a good burger, but the stand just isn't up to my standards. Soo disappointed. Looks like I'm still on the search for a good local burger joint close to my house."}
{"text":"\"Short Rib taco, Cheeseburger, Fries and a Shake. Pretty sure they wrote a song about this very thing, definitely \"paradise\". This WILL be my new hidden gem, can't wait to intro this place to my friends!\""}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers! Fries are good too, tried the tacos & didn't like them as much. Only complaint is it does take awhile I thought it might be quicker to go in then use the drive thru like we usually do...my husband said that three cars that arrived after us already went through the drive thru before I came out. The employees are friendly & if you like sweets definitely get a shake they are delicious!"}
{"text":"My hands are still a little sticky from finishing my burger but I had to write this review right away. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had. The seasoning is spot on, the bun isn't soggy from the juices, and the veggies are SO fresh. Also, the meat & veggie proportions are just right. I can be dramatic at times - but seriously this is what I imagine when I crave the perfect burger.  Gotta give it a try. I mean, they even have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Love the food but the service is consistently horrible - 10 min wait in the drive thru with nothing but a \"I'll be right with you followed by 10 mins of silence.\"  Not acceptable.  Then the kicker is going inside to order because I really like the food, asking what happened and having the 12yr old at the counter give me attitude and act like a total prick.    I like supporting local restaurants but you need to pick your s*&$ up.  It doesn't matter how good you food is - if I know its going to be a hassle more often than not I'll just go to one of the other 900 burger places in town..."}
{"text":"It is deeply disappointing that The Stand has stopped serving their beautiful tacos and street corn. These are their two best offerings and never disappoint. I have been a long time customer of original Arcadia location and it is especially bad for those of us that have supported you guys from the start. I am hoping you change your minds. For me, it means you lost your edge. You have taken away the best of your menu. I love you guys. Please."}
{"text":"Excellent drive thru service, seriously it was Ritz Carlton shi%. Ordered a lot of food, the burgers were excellent, shakes, lemonade ridiculous. The fries were good, the tacos were pretty damn good, and the Mexican corn was really good! Haha. Overall 5 stars, go there!"}
{"text":"Best milk shakes ever!!!! There is the vanilla chocolate chili chocolate Carmel  chocolate.         Carmel delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped in after taking our kids to a play in Tempe.  Maybe I was just in a happy mindset and easy to please, but I loved this place.    My wife and daughter split a standard burger with cheese, I went for the standard with bacon and cheese and my little guy wanted a taco.  While trying to get him to decide which meat he would eat (he said he wanted cinnamon, not a helpful response.....) and figuring out what I would need to take off the women at the register mentioned kids options.  These include grilled cheese, quesadilla, kids burger and tacos where you choose your meat and toppings.  We chose ground beef and added cheese.  The boy was happy, we were happy.  Tried a couple of shakes and chips and salsa.  All really good.  Salsa a little different profile, but I liked it.  Also had fries which were perfect.  Patient with ordering and the split up the burger and shakes without issue.  Very accommodating and attentive service.  Only wish I of the kids options earlier, but know I know."}
{"text":"The burger was really good but I must say because of it's location and fact it has such limited parking and gets so crowded it makes it really inconvenient. We got there right around 11:30am knowing the lunch rush would come shortly and I'm glad we did. A line formed minutes after we sat down and it got packed, the Dining room is small but they have some outdoor seating in the patio. The burger was delicious juicy and well seasoned with fresh toppings, gooey cheese and their special stand sauce which is basically like a 1000 island type sauce was very very good. I scarf my burger down in minutes! The fries were really good and looked fresh cut and seasoned with both salt and pepper which you don't see often, that was a plus! My husband also ordered a short rib taco, very good the beef was super tender and the toppings and salsa were very fresh. The banana stand shake was bomb with fresh bananas and banana pudding mixed in and the salted caramel shake was delish also. Bummer on those were they didn't come until we were almost done eating, guess a large order for shakes came in at the same time. I slightly compare the burger to in n out although they use fancier lettuce and their sauce is a little different. I did enjoy this place and the staff and service were great I'm  Glad I got to try it but the annoyance of it's location, limited parking and fact the cars using the drive thru basically blocks your ability to exit most likely will prevent me from returning, besides I don't live close and there is also no bathroom! I had to scarf down my food so I could hurry to find a bathroom elsewhere but not the end of the world. Definitely worth trying but be patient and know it's a small place and gets packed, I suppose that does show you they have quite a fan base."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer of The Stand's Arcadia location for a couple years now. I also happen to be vegan. When I went in last weekend for my usual order of two veggie tacos, no cheese or butter, I was informed that the tacos have been dropped entirely from the menu. The only thing you can get there now is a burger. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed as I love to support local businesses; but if there's nothing that meets my dietary requirements, I'm afraid I won't be going back. :("}
{"text":"I went with the family to The Stand for the first time this weekend and we absolutely loved the burgers and fries. I cannot comment on anything else on the menu, but I would certainly recommend the burgers.  The staff was also extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was very unique and original. Everything tasted great! You can't beat the value offered. I would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good ol fashioned cheesey cheese burger.  You are in luck. Was happy to have stumbled upon this little gem of the east valley.   Their chips and guacamole are off the chain and I have had a couple bites of their tacos and what a taste bud pleaser.  also take advantage of their delicious juices YUM. The staff is always been nice and when I am near that side of town I always look forward to stopping by. They have amazing hours."}
{"text":"WHY would you get rid of your tacos and guacamole? They were the best thing about The Stand, IMO. The burgers are just ok...Ingo's Paris Texas is my go-to favorite burger, so I'm not sure I have a reason to frequent The Stand now, sadly..."}
{"text":"'It's AWESOME!!!' says 6 year old gluten free boy.   'I love The Stand. I love the shakes!! Says 4 year old little lady.   Vegetarian mom agrees. Great good and the service was just as fabulous. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm the hugest fan of lemonade and this place has some of the best!  Just be sure to say \"light on the ice\" or you'll have about 7 sips of lemonade and a ton of ice left.  I've also tried the veggie tacos which are very tasty, love the pickled onions on them.  The burger is also good and the bread tastes soft and fresh.  The fries are delicious and well seasoned.  Overall a great neighborhood spot and great for late night munchies."}
{"text":"I want there because it got good reviews but unfortunately they completely forgot me order and instead of trying to make it right to keep me coming back he just basically said \"oops\" then gave me my money back. Ow well (:*/"}
{"text":"I've only ever had the specialty shakes, and the spicy chocolate shake is amazing!  Cool, refreshing, with a kick."}
{"text":"The burger was to die for it was fresh and so where the fries. I'm not a fan of special sauces but this one was so good a must try."}
{"text":"Soooo sad! Just tried the burger I've heard about and asked for extra sauce. There was barely any !  Also not even one napkin in the bag. Went through the drive up window. Was kind of dry and flavorless. Shake is good though and my dog enjoyed the rest of the burger. The cheese was missing as well:("}
{"text":"Great customer service with friendly, cheerful and outgoing staff. Of course, the burgers were amazing, and the veggie taco is a must try for all vegetarians! The best part was the owner giving us three FREE milkshakes just because he had overheard we were first time customers who thought their milkshakes sounded tasty. We were all super surprised by his generosity. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"Nicest staff that welcome you with huge smiles. Burgers are fresh and juicy. Fries are awesome. Horchata is made fresh daily, a difference you can actually taste. And holy cow the milk shakes are heaven. The music is a plus. Very chill environment."}
{"text":"It's ok. The food is good. A little expensive for what it is. The menu is not very big so I've had everything on there I think. I usually spend more than $10 for what is essentially a fast food meal. I tried the drive through once, which took about 45 minutes to get some of my food. The rest was acquired after they realized I was still there after they shut the window on me. It wasn't busy, maybe not a typical experience, but definitely unacceptable.   3 stars for good food. Missing the other 2 for bad service and a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Got the standard with fries. I recommend you try them. The burger was super fresh. The staff was extra nice. A small place but the food is done right."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by someone. Not sure what they are thinking. Meat is thin, dry, moderate quality,  and seemingly pre-cooked. The fries are soggy, odd tasting, with no single fry over two inches long.  The chocolate shake was great. Save your burger craving for the many better options in Phoenix.  This place is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!  Everything is authentic and delicious. I could eat here everyday, the people who run it are very friendly and cool. Indian tacos and pop overs are bomb!!!! I give it 5 stars but id give it a million if I could. Every one should go here at least once or twice a week!! :)"}
{"text":"Better than any place in town. Both the tacos and burgers are absolute heaven. the salted dulce de leche milkshake is the BEST thing in phoenix. as of right now they have a seasonal peach lemonade that is great, but too sweet for a lot of people. The drive thru is a little tricky because it was designed to have a drive thru, but always a good second if the inside is already closed. if I was choosing tacos or burger...go with the burger."}
{"text":"Places seem to come and go at this location I missed the last one.  came like the day after it shut its doors so I wasn't going to be left out this time.  Glad I went,  Had the Stand Cheeseburger, fries and a Banana Shake it was all good.(Love the HUGE straws) looking forward to making it back to try some of those Tacos!!    Lets see if we can keep this place going and break that bad location mojo."}
{"text":"\"Okay\" is the appropriate way to describe this place.  The difference between two and three stars seems a bit extreme, as it wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly doesn't have me excited to go back anytime soon.  I feel comfortable giving it three stars because the service was excellent; the staff was super friendly, helpful, and very welcoming.  I also think they did a nice job with what they had to work with in the existing building.  It's simple but comfortable, and a good environment for their type of product.  Where the Stand falls short though is where it's most important, the food!  I had a couple of short rib tacos, the lady had the veggie tacos, and we ordered a side of fries, chips and salsa, and a dulce de leche shake (we wanted to make sure we got a good variety to try, I guess...)  The ingredients definitely seemed to be of quality and fresh, just like they advertise, but nothing was really that 'great'.  Short ribs are typically very juicy, tender, and succulent, these tacos were almost on the dry side.  The veg tacos had a good mix of veggies in them, but again did not really serve up anything that would make us regulars.  I guess I might be less critical on the taste and finished product if it weren't so expensive.  The tacos weren't cheap, and either were the fries.  The fries were good, comparable to the regular fries at five guys in taste and price, but think about 1/8 less quantity than you would get in the lunch bag portion at 5 guys.  The dulche de leche shake was good, plain and simple - it didn't disappoint, but I'm not craving to have it anytime soon either.    I really wanted this place to be good, as it's a few blocks from my house, but the product at the price point just doesn't deliver, and one or the other has to give.  The shake and the fries were good, but nothing I couldn't get over at zinburger or many other spots in the area.  Granted, I did not have the burger on this go round, and the place is still very new, I just didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth.  Either the food would have to be significantly better to get me to pay sit-down taco prices (overhead of a sit-down Mexican restaurant aside) or the prices would have to come down to get me to feel like that quality of food was 'worth' it.  Maybe it's a case of this business not really finding its identity.  They seem to be trying to serve higher than drive-thru quality food at higher than drive-thru quality prices while still trying to maintain their 'drive-thru 2.0' type image.    I guess given the many good food choices in the arcadia/biltmore area, this one just didn't have anything to set itself apart and get me to go there instead of any of my other options."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for a tasty burger this place is a must try! Very friendly service each time we've came. Worth the wait!!!!!! Yummy. Bathrooms can use an update."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place because it is run by a celiac and sounded trustworthy to go to. We had also called and spoke to the owner about food safety there. We haven't had issues with cross contamination in the past, but every time we go there and a certain girl is taking our order, she messes it up every single time. We do not have out of the ordinary orders- we just get them without buns. Once we ordered all lettuce wrapped and we were brought out gluten buns, we were missing a fry order on another occasion and were never given it after asking about it, and on the latest stop I got very sick after going which means I was cross contaminated somehow. The burgers are delicious 4/5 star worthy and fries are 5/5 but I don't think we will ever be coming here again because of too many issues with food safety as celiacs."}
{"text":"Honestly...I was very disappointed this was not like anything I was expecting based on pics I had seen. Wife and I went last night. Sadly we won't be returning. It's way over priced! They charge pretty much for everything you order, I think even the ketchup and stand sauce. All we ordered was a burger cut in half, an order of fries, two short rib tacos and a coke and large horchata. This was $28 and change! The food was not all that. The horchata was warm and had an after taste like when something has gone bad (sour) I won't leave my in-n-out burger for nothing in this world, amazing food and reasonable prices. We were going to order some shakes after, but with our deception. We were afraid to spend more money and those be bad too! I honestly would have requested my money back. We pretty much tossed everything half through. We didn't like it. It hurt to spend $28 and toss it in the trash. Sorry just our opinions."}
{"text":"First time at The Stand and the burger my wife and I shared was delicious.   The fries are hot, crispy and tasty.  We shared the chicken and short rib taco as welk and both were great.  All the food tasted fresh and well seasoned.  The could do with a little more indoor seating during the summer but other than that I will be eating here often."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in I got hit with a whiff of flavor and got a flashback of my server days at Johnny Rockets. I saw the menu and knew I had to try it all. The stand burger was delicious and the tacos were unbelievably good. The fries were good but this place is differently a place you go for a taco or burger.  The elotes were not up to my par but the guacamole was good. The atmosphere and aesthetics of the place were on fleek.  Definitely a place I am coming back to."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  The menu is pretty short and simple, which doesn't matter because the food is amazing!!! I always order the veggie tacos (best I've ever had), fries with stand sauce (sauce is really good) and the Salted Carmel Dulche De Leche shake which is sooooo yummy. I highly recommend every one try that shake."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and we were very satisfied with the food and prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a solid burger joint that's hobbled by very poor service and long lines. I like the food but as others have pointed out the drive through is unbelievably slow and orders are often incorrect or incomplete. The owners have had plenty of time to sort out these kinds of issues, and they just haven't. I don't know if it's bad luck, incompetence, or a mix - but I will steer clear of The Stand in the future. I hope they can resolve the problems because the food is good. But it's not worth the trouble when there are plenty of other good options in the area."}
{"text":"Very cute little hole in the wall Indian fry bread  the guy that rang us up was real nice very friendly. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I was driving around town trying to figure out what to eat. We couldn't decide but came upon an old faithful, The Stand. I had already planned out my meal even before entering the establishment.   To my utter dismay and disappointment have recently learned that everything I planned on eating tonight were gone!!! All the tacos and corn, chips and salsa... gone from this location! Why?! Now I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and Shea to enjoy those delicious tacos. After so many years of patronage this is how we're thanked...   The burgers are good but the likelihood I'll be back is very slim."}
{"text":"Sensational! There's nothing fancy here. Great burgers, great fries & tasty tacos. The shakes are killer also, especially the banana.   The service can be great or meh, depends on your night. Also, it can get crazy busy do be prepared to wait. But it's seriously well worth it!"}
{"text":"By far the best gluten-free burger place ever. Incredible, local, family-based service."}
{"text":"I had a very mixed experience at The Stand. The burger and fries were good. The chocolate shake was divine: rich and creamy. The drive-thru was horrible. It took us at least 30 minutes to order and get our food when there were only four cars in front of us. i can understand how drive-thrus can get backed up. It happens. All the worker had to do was apologize for the wait when we got our food. We complained about the wait and we got a half hearted apology. I would like to go back because the food is good and I want to support a local business. My only hesitation is the long wait. It is hard to wait that long in a drive- thru."}
{"text":"The other night I was looking for a good burger and fries. I found this on google maps right down the street from my house. I decided to try it out. This is the best kind on small burger shack that you can have. Quick service, friendly staff, and AMAZING burgers. This even beats out my favorite burger place In-and-Out. Better ingredients better flavors and local. I will be back and next time I will be needing a jar of Stand Sauce for my fries."}
{"text":"My wife and I are stand regulars.  Only two variables keeps it from 5 star every time:  - Too much seasoning on fries (wth) - Buns as dry as sand  Granted this is still a four star rating, but as regulars I hope they take notice that some people may experience the salt overload or dry bun on their first experience and elect not to come back.  That was a run on sentence and I am not fixing it."}
{"text":"Simple menu, got the standard with cheese...burger was juicy and seasoned well...the standard sauce goes great with the fries"}
{"text":"I've been to The Stand several times - I'll agree with the reviewers on here who have said the burgers are fantastic, they're easily my favorite fast-food burgers in Phoenix.  I'm also quite a fan of the fries - they are a bit salty as some have noted, but that tends to be how I like my fries anyhow so no complaints here.  The tacos aren't quite as fantastic - the ingredients sure do taste fresh, but the combination on the whole is just \"good\", not great.  If you're really hankering for a taco, I recommend the short rib over the somewhat bland chicken.  The salsa is a mild disappointment too - the \"hot\" salsa is anything but, though it does have a decent flavor.  Service here is friendly, if somewhat chaotic and occasionally a bit \"too\" friendly (like asking if you need a refill 3 times even after you've said no).  The decor is great, doing a neat job of intertwining the burger shack feel with Arcadia stylings.  The patio is small but nice - completely enclosed, hiding the traffic and noise of Indian School (for the most part).  All in all I strongly recommend The Stand if you're looking for a burger - if you're looking for tacos, though, you may find better options elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"What a great burger! Been here several times. Always a great value and excellent service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.   When you go to the stand you know it's going to be a wait for your food. Like 10-15 mins for a shake or taco, that type of wait. Which is fine, it's all hand made.   Last night we went to the drive through to order a couple tacos. Waited for 20 minutes in the drive through line. Only to get up to the window to say hey I'm sorry we don't have the taco you ordered.... You can see how that would be annoying. Pretty bad customer service."}
{"text":"The Stand is an above average burger and taco joint that has a very simplistic menu. The burger is very similar to In and Out, the fries are solid, and the shakes are tasty and rich. The Tacos aren't much to write home about."}
{"text":"Horribly slow. Crowded dining room. The food can be gotten at In and Out burger for half the price for the same food.   All in all, not worth the trip and the time wastes on a lunch hour."}
{"text":"Love this place. Dulce de Leche shack with a double cheese burger and fries, its heaven."}
{"text":"Great burger place .  Employees are great with huge smiles on their faces .  They bring your food out and the shakes are amazing ! Try them ."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and it was good, not excellent. The fries are a little better then 5guys but with such a limited menu and an exceptionally long wait time.... like 20 minutes in the drive thru... I'm not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the area to offer a vegetarian dish. While the vegetable tacos left some to be desired, their unique take on an urban street taco was filling. The hand-spun shakes are decent, and the service, sans one employee, was top notch. In fact, my cashier was one of he friendliest emotes I have ever encountered in a fast food joint.  The ambiance is inviting; the small space had a very urban, beachy vibe. While I am unsure as to if I will purchase the tacos a second time, the shakes will have me coming back."}
{"text":"First time there and its excellent,.service with a smile, how refreshing! And the tacos and burgers are great, a place well worh the money!"}
{"text":"This is my reliable burger place. I always know the burgers will be good, the service will be good, & the lemonade will be awesome (when in season). Not a ton of options for menu items, but what they do, they do right. I'm always full and happy when I leave."}
{"text":"As a huge burger and fries fanatic, I must give this joint 3.5 stars.   As good as it is, there's just so many more places that are better. The flavor is great! Fresh cut fries are always a hit for me. The wait time was about average given the lunch time rush. If it is always like that though it would be an issue. It was difficult to get in the back to park because of the drive thru line that was wrapped around the building and to the street.   All in all, I'd go there again for lunch occasionally since it's close to work and more affordable than the upscale places and better quality than McDonalds."}
{"text":"Burger, Fries, Shake, and 1 taco = $17.74 and I wouldv'e paid more. Juiciest double stack perfectly cooked washed down with a consistantly textured flavorful shake and an authentic style short rib taco to boot. Try getting that at quality in any restaraunt in town. This is a restaraunt by the way and locally owned with fresh ingredients and no added hormones. If you want fast food go to McDonalds you cheap bastard."}
{"text":"The short rib tacos were fantastic! I'll definitely be back for those and I will try the burger after hearing it's similar to In and Out. I really like that they keep the menu simple which is probably why their food is great. Great transformation of the space as I've noticed it's been turned over several times in the past 6 years I've lived in the area. The short ribs definitely compare to the short rib tacos served at another local restaurant off Camelback Road but you get much better, faster service here! Well done and I will be back."}
{"text":"The Stand is a great place for when you need good food to go. I've tried their short rib tacos, chicken tacos, standard burger, and French fries. Everything is good but the short rib tacos are definitely my favorite. They also have some of the best milkshakes I've ever had. They are so thick and creamy. I love to mix their chocolate and banana shakes. The drive thru line gets long and I wouldn't call them speedy or \"fast\" food, but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch on Sunday.  I was encouraged by the fact that they had so many customers on an off hour. They've done a fantastic job with redoing the place.  The staff was very friendly and they seem to have regulars already. My husband and I had the burger, add jalapenos and split fries. The burger was great. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The burger did remind me of in and out, which I'm fine with. I didn't like the fries but I'm weird about fries and don't like most. I really hope they make it, that location seems to have a quick turn over rate. I will definitely be back and I love they have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burgers! Good quality meat, dressed with fresh veggies and thick cut pickles. The Stand sauce reminds me of Utah fry sauce, and it's tasty on burgers and fries alike. The fries are good, but not great. Could stand to be crispier, but they're seasoned well. Good service, too. I would absolutely come back next time I'm craving a burger."}
{"text":"The Stand has overall the best burgers in the city for quality of meat and other fixings. The portions are large for the price. Fries also excellent. Its small like the old type burger places but if you go on the off hours has very fast service."}
{"text":"As a business owner myself, it is always refreshing to see a concept who \"does it right\".  Amazing burger, great prices, the staff was SUPER on point as well as happy to be there.  The Stand is a winner in every way in my book...AND a drive-thru?  Great job!"}
{"text":"Best tacos. Decent burger. Unbelievable shakes and cool drinks. Love the concept. Short and sweet!"}
{"text":"Went here for the tacos and was underwhelmed. Good, but nothing special. What was special though was the shake! I had read some of the other reviews and was intrigued by the salted caramel shake. I ordered one and wow! Thick and smooth, not a common combo anymore. The caramel was great and the salted bits really added to the whole thing. I did have some guac and that was pretty good, again nothing super special but better than average. I didn't have the burgers so I can't speak to them. Overall, have a shake, they really are that good but there are better places for tacos"}
{"text":"We had the standard with cheese, chicken and short rib tacos (with pico). Really a 3 1/2 rating 3 for the food and 4 for the crew. Worth the price and I agree with another reviewer that this is a good alternative to in n out."}
{"text":"This place has the best milkshakes in town!  When I feel like spending a couple of bucks on a tasty treat, I go here and thoroughly enjoy the delicious varieties of milkshakes.  I like chocolate."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It is a regular for us. The food is amazing, specifically the street tacos! All of them are great. The service has always been pleasant which is saying something considering how many times we've been and its a drive through/eat out. One specific occasion during Christmas we stopped by late night for a taco for my husband, when we arrived they were closing up but they stayed late just to get the taco for my husband in addition they threw in two shakes for free \"just because its the holidays\". It was a very kind gesture and goodness was the shake good. The salted caramel is the best! Just shows what a great business it is though!"}
{"text":"Taking a stand for.. The Stand! - The tacos  are a 12 on a scale of 1-10!  The flavor is amazing and the salsa makes it  just pop!  The lemonade peach tea is ICE COLD on a hot AZ day... and home- made with fresh peaches.  The staff is friendly and the space is clean neat simple and  warm all at the same time! I will be back for the burger they make from scratch!  They even have a  DRIVE THROUGH option ! I would not be surprised if this place is featured on the travel channel soon..YUM!"}
{"text":"Best non-chain drive thru burgers in Phoenix.  Best fast-food burgers in town also.  They claim all meet is ground and formed daily... it tasted like it too.  Went on a busy Sunday evening, the service was very friendly and fast.  Cons:  My fries were to salty otherwise they would have been great.  I asked for no pickles but they left them all.. not a big deal but would have been nice  not to dig thru it.   I had the standard no cheese, plus butter sauteed onions and grilled peppers.  a Side of sauce for the fries.  I'd definitely go back next time I crave a quick burger.  Nice to finally see something succeed in that location.   Glad they have real hours unlike most  lazy joints in Phoenix, hence the busy Sunday evening."}
{"text":"A fun, tasty alternative to the newer fast-casual burger chains."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in here after driving by for months; hate to say it, but I kind of wished I'd continued on to 44th St/Thomas and Five Guys instead. As others have noted, it's a very limited menu here, and I went the cheeseburger route tonight. This is an order at the counter place, and then your food is brought out in a few minutes. My cheeseburger was 2 patties of beef cooked to death, not burned but so well-done that the beef was completely dried out, little flavor. Cheese was taste-free. Three thick rings of white onion, two dill pickle chips, a lot of lettuce, and \"Stand sauce\", whatever that is. The white bread bun was as dry as the burger, so no improvement there; its surface cracked while I was eating it. It might have been grilled? French fries were the frozen variety, mostly pieces around an inch long or shorter, varied between crispy (the small bits) and not crispy (the fewer longer pieces). Another reviewer stated that fries were free on Mondays? Not true for me. Full price. Stand sauce\" costs extra. There's better news with the shake:  Deep chocolate flavor, thick, creamy, and a big wide boba straw so you can actually drink it, and the only thing that brought this review up to two stars. There's also Coke hecho en Mexico in 500 mL glass bottles.  Sorry to have to be so negative, but I'm lost as to all these 4-5 star ratings, just don't see or taste it here. I love cheeseburgers, I do, but I couldn't even finish this one. Shocking. I'd have returned it for a do-over, but my dining partner's sandwich was exactly the same as mine, so I don't think it was a fluke. I'll come back to try some of the tacos, and the \"Mexican corn\" sounds good (seasonal spring-summer), but for burgers I'll be dining elsewhere. Life's too short for a bad cheeseburger."}
{"text":"First, the burgers are really awesome! But ordering in the drive-thru is so frustrating because they can't hear you. Last night we waited for 20 minutes with only two cars ahead of us. We finally get to the window and not so much as a \"hey, sorry it took so long\".  The tacos are just ok. Good burgers and fries but you cannot expect people to wait for 20 minutes and not even acknowledge it. We may go back but if there's more than one car ahead of us, I won't wait."}
{"text":"I've had a good first experience at the stand! Their food is all fresh, made to order. I love that. The menu is simple and to the point, with a few extra ingredients like caramelized onions and grilled jalapeño for flair on your burger. I have yet to try the tacos but I will definitely be back to do so. Staff at the stand is friendly, without being fake. My only miss on this place is that there's no cheddar cheese...only American. Give this place a whirl and definitely get the fresh lemonade!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting double patty burger!!! I came for the gluten free bun and it was amazing!! The fries are sooo yummyyyy!! Gotta get the Mexican corn on the stick!!!! WOWWWWW!! I'm so impressed!!! Waaaay better than In n Out!!! Drive thru is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and I've been there several times. I've tried everything except the milkshakes and the veggie taco.  Burgers are pretty good if you are a fan of the in-and-out style of burger. I do wish they had a single patty option, as the double stack is pretty big.   The short rib taco is better than the chicken, but I'm not the biggest fan of the pickled veggies on them. I just pick them off.  Fries and guacamole are great!  The chips are strange though. They use a different type of oil that I think is supposed to be healthier. Both times I've tried them all I can taste is that oil and it has a strong smell too. I always get take out and I can smell the chips in my kitchen for hours after they've been in there.  I have no real complaints. It is a good place if you are looking for a quick bite that's better than a traditional drive through. But be prepared to wait a little longer too. They make your food to order, so unless you want to spend a significant time in your car, I would skip the drive though if there is even a single car in line."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local burger and shake joint. The burgers are always fresh and juicy. The short rib tacos are dreamy. The salted dulce de leche shake will change your life - don't miss it! Love the owners and staff, too!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Burgers were awesome! Fries were awesome! Shakes were awesome! Service was awesome! The prices might be a dollar or two more than you would like to pay for burgers and fries but it's worth it! Everything is made fresh to order and it's good! You will want more immediately."}
{"text":"So I came by this place for lunch today and I was soo glad I did!   First of all they do fast food made fresh. What a great concept, who would have thought lol. So that was def a factor. They only do buglers and tacos really, they have some sides but those are their specialties.  I went with a cheese burger, and fries, easy order. The burger came with a double patty and basic toppings. I loved it! I could tell it was made just for me and that goes a long way in my book. The fries are great, nice and crispy.  You absolutely have to order the salted dulce de leche milk shake, I have never had something so good in all my life, wow. Salty sweet and creamy, this is a powerhouse of a milkshake.  Definitely check this place out, I will be back soon to try tacos and street corn!!"}
{"text":"Last Monday we had a birthday to celebrate and the staff chose the Stand for lunch. I called in the order and got a helpful young lady who later would hand me a tasty bag of burgers, tacos and kick ass pico. Good stuff ... highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth burger and perfect sweet-tart lemonade."}
{"text":"Very good. More chicken in the chicken taco, please.  Small, focused menu that they cook well."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great fries and fantastic shakes! Best \"fast food\" in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I had an outstanding first experience here this past Monday, partly due to the fact that it was \"Free Fry Monday\" where you get free fries with any burger purchase before 3pm.  Since they took care of the fries, I opted to add the Niman's Ranch bacon to my burger, and forego a delicious looking milk shake... this trip.  I learned that they have a gluten-free bun option which is a pleasant surprise for an in-and-out style burger and will try it on my next trip.  The staff was extremely pleasant - welcoming on my first visit and I'm pretty sure every single staff member asked me what I thought and they even addressed me by my name.  I highly recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers are very good, but every time I've been here (3) it's taken a year to get my food.  I notice tacos are no longer on the drive-thru menu.  It's a shame, but I'm assuming they will be out of business soon if they can't improve their speed."}
{"text":"It pains me to write a mediocre review for The Stand. We have been fans since the doors opened and The Stand was the neighborhood's best kept secret.   But it seems as though The Stand isn't what it used to be. Gone are the delicious tacos. Gone is the consistency in the food. Gone is the amazing and friendly service.   Our visits to The Stand used to include a burger and fries for my husband and tacos for me. On a recent visit, we learned that The Stand was no longer serving tacos but we could \"just drive to the new location to get tacos.\" Mind you the new location is a good 20 minutes away. Not just a quick hop over there. We've found the quality of the previously delicious burger to only be so-so and very inconsistent. When we tried to order the '36 St. fries\" the staff couldn't fulfill our order because they didn't have anything to serve it in. Seems a little odd to not have proper plates for their food.   We did check out the food stall at \"The Bar\" which is run by The Stand. Excellent food and service. I think we'll be frequent visitors there more often. But so sad to see The Stand go downhill, we really loved it."}
{"text":"This place has the best frybread! My favorite is the bean and cheese but the red chili is bomb too."}
{"text":"Wanted a good burger and that's what we got. I got the fries as well and they were real crispy! Yum. We got the chicken taco and that was tasty too. We wanted the short rib, but they were all out. The stand sauce is pretty great too. Only thing is I wish they had a different bun for the burger. Next time I would like to try the shakes."}
{"text":"It's dangerous that I can walk to this place in about three minutes. Their shakes are AMAZING. Best ever.  Their burgers are great too, as are their fries. In fact, all I need is a shake and some fries from this place and I'm happy as a clam. Unfortunately, we really did not enjoy the tacos here. Hopefully, they improve on them - I would love to have a great drive through taco place minutes from me.  I've never actually been in this place, just through the drive through. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a shake."}
{"text":"Just had another great burger but the most excellent fries were, once again, way over-salted.  Plug up some of those holes in the seasoning shaker, review the process, etc. but please look for a way to keep this from happening on a regular basis.  I'll definitely be back to check......"}
{"text":"Great burger - tender with a double patty that comes as a basic option. Decent taco - the short rib option was meaty, nothing spectacular though. The fries were the best part of the meal - scratch made and crispy, very hard to beat! Worth a try, but probably not a regular spot at this point."}
{"text":"My dude SWEARS by this place. He would (and attempts to) eat here every single day. We haven't tried the tacos yet but a note on the milkshakes - stick to the vanilla. Oh, and always get the stand sauce for your fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers and love the stand sauce. Not a very big place so waiting to order in the tiny place with lot of people can get your anxiety going. All in all a good place to eat, especially on free fry monday"}
{"text":"The shakes are out of this world...buttery vanilla and all the other goodness.  Burgers are delicious with good blend of beef...the sauce is great, but too salty. Get it on the side and dip as you see fit.  Fries are great also...good all around and worth coming back."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, everyone smiling. Damn good burger, nicely seasoned fries. Banana shake makes me feel like a got a week's worth of potassium in one go."}
{"text":"This Place Has Delicious Burgers and Decent Fries, The Salted Shake is great however don't let it melt. I am usually a huge fan of the Horchata they serve here however last time I was in the Horchata was way to watered down. And that Is the reason why I rated it 3 Stars. The Tacos are in my opinion not something I would get here but the burgers sure do make up for the Tacos!    Try This Place!"}
{"text":"I read about The Stand in the AZ Republic, and I was intrigued by their limited menu.  There is a double burger, and 3 kinds of street tacos: short rib, chicken, and veggie.  They also have fries, chips & salsa, and a variety of beverages...including milk shakes.  I am a sucker for the milk shake, and when I read that they have BOTH chocolate chile and salted dulce de leche shakes, I KNEW I had to try this place.  The very next day, I went with a couple of co-workers.  The first thing I noticed about the place was the big, bright blue BIKE RACK out front.  There is a drive thru, and the place gets busy for lunch.  The service was fast and friendly, but another coworker who went today on my recommendation said she waited a long time in the drive through line.  We found our burgers, fries, shakes and lemonades to be superior, and we all plan to go back to The Stand again.  I hope to be on my bike next time!"}
{"text":"I vacillate between two and three stars on this place. The food is OK, but only just. I had burger & fries and they seemed on a par with Burger King. The default is that they come with some sort of salad dressing added, so I had to request it be omitted. I admit I generally prefer only veggies on my burgers. I don't care for pickles, relish, or any sort of slimy crap. The manager seemed offended by my request.  There was no spicy mustard or salsa option. Fries were good, but not in the same league as Z's Greek just down the street. My wife said the tacos were OK, but not up to Julioberto's standards. The interior decoration was very good, a substantial upgrade from the prior incarnation. The place was very clean. The prices were high compared to the other referenced standards. We went on a Sunday, and the place seemed crowded with an obviously after church crowd with many church ladies and kids."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Amazing fries.. Great selection of food.   Friendly staff. Like I mean very friendly. I wish more places were like that.   Can't wait to try the corn when it's in season.   The drive through is a little slow but I think it's cause it's not your typical \"fast food\"  We love that this place is close to our house!!!   We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. The burgers are reasonably priced and very good quality. They have great shakes too."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Consistently good food, nice people.  Reasonable price.  Delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious.  We've had the cheeseburgers, fries, milkshakes, and tacos.  The vegetarian taco is just fantastic.    Prompt, friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Incredibly yummy food.  We're sticking with The Stand."}
{"text":"Great burgers, really good fries and amazing milkshakes.  Love the short-rib tacos, not so crazy about the veggie or chicken tacos.   Super friendly employees who always go out of way to please.  And LOVE that they have a drive-thru, too!"}
{"text":"Incredible burgers.  My wife's bacon burger was Awesome.  So juicy and tasty.  I added grilled onions to my cheeseburger and it was the best burger I've had in a long time.  Maybe ever. I will be back. Don't live nearby but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Left the drive thru today with no food because they have stopped selling tacos at their original location. I used to be able to please my whole,family with the burger/taco menu. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh. The burger was good, not great. The fries were OK. I tried a chicken taco. It was a basic street taco with a bit more meat. There was a hint of pickled bbq onion (sweet & sour?) that seemed out of place. I prefer the straight forward flavors (and prices) of In -N-Out."}
{"text":"Normally the food is great here BUT recently they took off their Mexican items from their menu by placing a piece of paper over it. It was upsetting to learn about this change because their burgers are decent but you find burgers anywhere. Not sure why they took of their amazing Mexican foods... which was something that made them special and now they're just a normal burger place. They also charge separately for all items and do not let consumers know of allergens."}
{"text":"Being in the area, I decided to give this place a try, Man I am not disappointed! Good food, excellent service, I cannot rave enough over this gem. I had the rib tip tacos, and some chips and guac. - not only was everything delicious, but served with a smile and very quickly. Good portion size, excellent taste and outstanding customer service make The Stand a Stand Out whenever I am in this part of town."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for some late night street tacos. First time here, so my boyfriend and I decided to sample all three. I had the chicken taco & the veggie. I was excited by the amount of meat in the chicken taco, but the flavor was bizarre. It had a sweet, cinnamon flavor that I didn't like. The veggie was awesome! Hearty & spicy with quinoa, black beans and tons of flavor. My boyfriend tried the braised short rib taco and he loved it. It was very savory and packed with meat. I'm sure we will be back to satisfy those late night munchies. Oh, and the drive-thru only took 5 mins. Not bad."}
{"text":"Food is average but hot diggitty THE MILKSHAKES!  We came here for a casual lunch, but everything that we ate was completely overshadowed by the angelic elixir that is The Stand's Dulce de Leche milkshake. They serve this delicacy equipped with a giant straw which is AWESOME! If they had an intravenous option, I would go with that. This is the milkshake you have been waiting for!  As for the food, we had a cheeseburger, the pork taco, the chicken taco, fries, and chips with guac. The food was \"eh\". It's like a Honda Civic. Will it get you where you need to go? Yes. Are you rushing to the dealership to buy one after winning the lottery? Probably not. Good enough for lunch but probably won't come back for food. Just more heaven in a cup with a giant straw.   Staff was cool, ambiance was relaxed, patio was weird and cool. Check out The Stand for a milkshake. They are bomb.com"}
{"text":"After hearing many rave reviews about the milkshakes at The Stand, I returned yesterday with a girlfriend of mine to try one. I ordered the vanilla and she ordered the banana one and decided to add chocolate to it. We were both thoroughly impressed! The shakes are made with delicious ice cream and had the occasional specs of ice in them that separate the \"real\" shakes from the \"made from mix\" ones.  Friendly, professional service as usual from the owners who are dedicated to making their new business a success."}
{"text":"Best Service in town hands down!  Everyone there is super nice and the food is wonderful.  I eat here at least once a week.  Great little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to go to this new spot in town and we were just as excited if not more walking away planning our next visit with fully bellies and big smiles. The burgers were very tasty. The fries were good and the shakes were seriously out of this world. We got a salted dulce de leche and then special ordered a chocolate banana stand shake.   The staff was super friendly and we chatted with the owner for quite some time. I love her vision and her desire to serve a great product at a low price in an awesome atmosphere. They've only been open for a week and she's already achieved it!   I'm excited to send my friends here and to come back and try the tacos, lemonade and horchata."}
{"text":"They may have a limited selection, but the taste is astounding. It's so good that I'm at  loss for words. Highly recommended for anyone looking to have a burger or tacos."}
{"text":"Actually, the salted caramel milkshake can be beat - by their banana stand shake.  I don't even like bananas that much but it's amazingly good."}
{"text":"I read the AZ Republic review of The Stand and decided to check it out because it's just down the street from me.  The food was great!  The building is small, but cute and clean with a few seats inside and a handful outside in a covered patio area.  I ordered The Stand burger with cheese and Niman Ranch bacon and shared fries and chips and guacamole with family.  The burger was one of the best I've had in a long time; great flavor, good sauce and fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles.  The fresh cut fries were also excellent, not too crisp but not soggy.  The chips and guac were also great, it will be a tough decision next time which side to order.  I highly recommend The Stand and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great burger, the shakes were good but my expectations were high due to other reviews......didn't meet expectations but good.  Burgers were great, the fries were good. Nice 2nd burger option in the area. I would choose 5 guys before the stand but the stand before smash.....to give perspective."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great burger with quality ingredients made to order. FANTASTIC shakes and a cute little vibe. Service is always friendly and the owner is always on too of things when I've seen her there.   Would I recommend this place? Heck yeah. Just plan to wait a little for your food.   Will I be back? Yep!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with friends and my 2 little girls.   Ordered 3 short rib tacos.   However, I only ate 2 since one of my friends was like \"I can believe you didn't order a burger.\"  As a result, I didn't eat the 3 rd taco and got up and ordered a Burger.  I'm happy I did.  It was flat out fantastic and Im a stickler for a good burger.  Not that the short rib taco was great.   I could of easily ate all 3 as they were great too.   Next time I go in there, I'm ordering a burger and 1 short rib taco.    This place is fantastic, and a wonderful bang for the buck.     Don't miss out on the shake either, (which i ordered for my little girls).   I almost sucked all theirs down.   One of the best chocolate shakes ever.   Next time you are in the area, drop in to The Stand and give it a try.   Nothing fancy, but no need to be.   They know what they are doing with the few items on the menu.    I could see them throwing in a special every now and then to mix things up or too try something different .   Overall,   this  place is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive-thru line just to find out they no longer serve all the best stuff!! No more tacos.  No more guacamole. No more street corn. What? Weird. The drive-thru lady even sounded depressed about it"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Of course it's going to take a little bit getting your food because everything is made fresh. Our food took about 10 minutes to get to us. I give it five stars because my shake was the best I'd ever had."}
{"text":"I gotta have guac on my burger.  The stand no longer offers guac.  That's the deal killer.  It's a shame because I liked coming here often and now I won't be back ever."}
{"text":"So good! High quality fast food, the meat in the burger is a blend and amazing! The hey keep it simple and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I called in my order at 4:00 and they said it would be ready in 5 to 10 minutes.  I asked if I could pick it up at the drive thru and they said yes or that I could come in.  I waited at the drive thru for several minutes and finally backed up and parked my car only to come in and have someone assist other people but not me.  I saw a bag on the to go counter and asked if that was mine.  I waited 10 minutes and after that paid and got the bag only to find out that the fries were COLD.  I said I wanted warm fries which they said they would do, but then I thought that means that the burger and taco that I got would even be COLDER.  I will never go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Monday's are awesome at The Stand! Free Fries with your meal. I have been for the past few weeks after starting a new job near here. For being such a small sit down restaurant, it is amazing. TRY THE SHAKES!!!  The staff is really nice, and the food rocks. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for a burger! The burgers are cooked to order, which makes it well worth the wait. The chicken tacos are awesome as well, despite the fact I do not like cilantro all that much. The fries are good, and the lemonade is simply fantastic.  The cheery employees helps set this place apart from any other. They really make you feel welcome and appreciated.  The Stand is also very well organized and clean. A very good indicator that the staff take pride in their job.   I will be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Salted dulce de leche shake is delicious.  Burgers are stacked well: fixings on the bottom, not too much of any one thing, a good balance - exactly what you want when you want a burger.  Fries are meh.  Very friendly inside and the staff seem quite happy to be working there, always a good sign."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious, service was very friendly (though a little slow) and the ambience is cool. One of the best burgers in town :)"}
{"text":"Love all the food!  Been going since they opened.  I always get a salted caramel milk shake, amazing!"}
{"text":"Really great food for such a tiny place. Don't blink when you drive in! (I get my car worked on next door and use this as an excuse to get a burger or a milk shake...) But I truly don't need an excuse. If you are hungry for a good burger, do NOT hesitate to check this little place out. Good fries and tacos too. Everything is fresh and full of flavor. The staff are all helpful and really friendly. Get the Stand Sauce too... My favorite meal is the double burger with fries. If you are in the mood for something else, the tacos are so flavorful you won't be disappointed. They are soft and the meat is marinated.  Next time you are in the hood, don't miss this little family owned gem."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger shack with a hip brand concept.  Awesome milkshake menu with the Banana shake being my favorite.  Burgers taste similar to in'n'out, but have fresher, higher quality ingredients.  Definitely on par with some of the other high-end burger joints.  Spent about $11 for a 2 patty cheeseburger and banana shake."}
{"text":"This place is right up there Street from where I live, and is aw they had gluten free buns, and me being a walking allergy case, had to check it out. Not only do they serve gluten free buns. But the cook with Rice Oil, which is amazing for people with a soy/peanut allergy! The fries were amazing, and the burger was delicious. Highly recommend to my allergy friends and to anyone else for that matter! The prices are also super reasonable. $5.50 for a burger and $2.50 for fries"}
{"text":"This is the first time for my daughter and me and my last . She had a chicken and short rib taco, bad beyond belief. I had the stand burger with cheese and bacon, should have done an in and out run, very disappointed, heard this place was good."}
{"text":"As always, skip to the last paragraph if you want the quick review!  I've driven by this joint on the north side of Indian School Rd. more than once and today I had an opportunity to stop and check it out.  I was getting it to go, but went inside to see what the place was like, rather than use the drive thru window. It is small, but what would you expect from a place called \"The Stand\".  I found it very clean and busy.  It was 12:30PM on a Monday.  There were three people ahead of me in line and a couple of people taking orders.  They moved us through pretty quickly. I ordered a burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, vege taco and a chocolate shake.  This will end up being two meals for me, but I always like to try a few different things when I go someplace for the first time. She asked if I wanted fries, I declined, she countered with \"It's free fries Monday\".  OK, I'll try the fries as well. My order was ready in about 10 minutes. The staff were friendly and you definitely got the feeling they were working hard to get things out as quickly as possible. Despite the small menu, they have some good offerings for the masses. I feel their pricing is fair.  The ingredients seemed to be of better than average quality, so I expect to pay a little more than average.  How does it go, do a few things and do them well.  Holds true at The Stand as far as I'm concerned.  The burger was reminiscent of old school In and Out, back when they were just in California, but just a touch better.  The shake was delicious, although could have been a touch smoother.  Fries were good as well.  If you like crispy fries, you'll probably want to request that when you order.  Vege taco was delicious.  Very well done.  Short rib taco was tasty too.  Will I go back? Yes, if I'm in the area and want a quick and tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch. Had a togo order of two burgers, one with cheese, one with grilled onions, fries and a short rib taco.  The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. If you want food fast, go to a burger chain.   The burgers are good. Better than any chain.  If you are expecting the best burger in the world, you're expecting too much for around 6 bucks. They are good burgers and I think they are worth the price.   The fries are....... Salty!  Yes after reading other reviews, I have to agree. They need to change their seasoning to have a third of the amount of salt that they use. It looks like it has other spices like pepper, but still way to much salt and I think they need to watch their temps on the fries as mine was overdone.   The taco I had was the short rib taco. For almost $3 it is tiny. The meat was a little dry, and I'm not faulting anything else about it since mine was togo and food changes consistency when you wrap it in foil. They just need to watch how long they cook the rib meat.  Until they figure that out, you are better off buying another burger instead.   I would definitely go back, and next time I would ask for fries with no salt and to watch the time on it in the fryer."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and fries. Good quality meat, fresh fries, served hot.Definitely would go back. Friendly staff, fun atmosphere. Reminds me of old time burger places back east."}
{"text":"The people here were so nice and the food was delicious. I had the rib tacos and my daughter had the hamburger. They suggested some kind of tea and it was delicious too! Nice little place for a quick dinner, super nice staff"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious and the french fries are outstanding!  Their food tastes fresh and it fits in great with the Arcadia vibe.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Now also my favorite burger when I want one that tastes like homemade that is packed with that grilled flavor and fresh ingredients, especially the thick and crunchy pickles. I was given a taste of the salted dulce de leche shake and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Tacos are a bit above average but their burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"The burgers aren't good enough to warrant a second trip. Shake Shack and Five Guys are easily higher quality, and they offer single-patty options on the menu."}
{"text":"small menu.  too pricey.  I've had bigger and better burgers for that price.  the little girl who took my order wanted to know if I was going to add gratuity to my $27 bill.  for what?  you just took my order.  you didn't wait on me hand and foot.  I ordered to go.  the taco was so small I needed a magnifying glass to find it in the bottom of the bag.  the dulce de leche shake:  I told my son I could open up a can of that stuff at home for cheaper."}
{"text":"I have known the owners Cindy & Mitch for a few years now. It was an honor to get to know them and their daughters over the years and to see their business grow. From what started as a stay at home mom making traditional Native American tortillas called \"Chumuth\" became a bustling and booming food stand. On Indian reservations, food stands are very common and offer homemade delicacies that cannot be found in the city. In the Salt River Reservation, just east of the city of Scottsdale, is The Stand that was named by the community and frequent guests. Cindy & Mitch sell homemade Indian frybread and Chumuth (tortillas) topped or wrapped around red chili beef that was stewed all day, green chili beef that sings a song of savory spiciness; ground beef with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheese. It's all fresh, it's all good and it's all hand made.   And when I say \"hand made\" I MEAN hand made! The dough is made by hand, no mixers here! The pinto beans are sorted and stirred by hand, even the fresh toppings are cut and doled by hand. Recently, I had a true honor of taking the film crew of \"Eden Eats\" of the Cooking Channel to the Stand, and we made chumuth and red chili and it was so much fun! I hope you are inspired by the show and by this review to go about 5 minutes outside of Scottsdale to the intersection of school and school, Alma School & Indian School (just east of the 101) and try some authentic Native American food!   To my yelpers I say: If you go - be sure to get there EARLY! The stand is only open from 11am - 4PM, but sometimes they run out of food. They are closed on weekends and sometimes they have breakfast burritos in the morning. Their parking lot is dirt, so expect to get your car a little dusty, and there is very limited seating. So be prepared to eat in the car. Just crank up the AC and try not to fall into a food coma... you might affixiate yourself! lol!"}
{"text":"Only leaving this review in the hopes that y'all get your act together. This place used to be amazing, I was perfectly fine paying a premium for quality food. Lately the food has been sub par and the service is not great either."}
{"text":"Good taste, Poor value. I'm definitely not a big eater but the portions were children's menu value."}
{"text":"Had a standard burger w roasted jalapeños, fries, chicken and short rib tacos - not all for myself... We were sharing. :)  Food wasn't too bad, but the place is a bit overrated in my opinion. I really liked their simple menu and friendly staff. However, their items were not worth four stars. Their burger was very mild - meaning no flavor.   Not sure which part of the beef that they use but I can tell that they are using quality beef but it lacks flavor. Fries were super soggy but tasted pretty good. I did like their sauce though. Tacos were pleasant but not something that I would crave for or want to go back for.  Overall, it was just OK for me."}
{"text":"When THE STAND moved into my neighborhood I was excited. The burgers and fries have always been good. However, they come up short in one area. I now have been there a total of six times. When I first ate there they always seemed to get the order wrong. I credited this to them being new. However, several times later the same thing and I then swore The Stand off. It had been a year since I last went there but tonight my wife and I were craving burgers and I thought I would give it one more try.   This evening I went in and ordered 2 cheeseburgers and two fries. I also got my wife a vanilla shake. The burgers were ordered not to include pickles. I even mentioned it the the cashier that they had trouble in the past getting the orders right.   I arrived home, the burgers smelled great and my wife loved the shake. However, again as appears to be their usual pattern....the order was wrong and one batch of fries was missing..... putting a damper on what would be a great meal..  I thought about not calling but it did upset me so I called and spoke with RON. I told him what happened and I was upset that this had happened to me in the past and I described the employees as idiots. Clearly, this upset him and he told me I could not call his employees idiots and hung the phone up on me. I had to phone back twice and finally got him to speak to me and I asked him about getting the money back I spent on the fries. He told me to come down and get it and hung up again.   I returned and I asked if the tall man was Ron he said he was. He handed me the money and I tried to explain that this was a continuing problem of not getting orders right. He started to go off on me inside and walked me outside...... He was waving his hands at me and telling me how much he cares for his employees. He also told me not to come back and that he could have me thrown out. And asked me if I have ever made a mistake.... and he was making a deal about it only being an order of fries. I did feel a little intimidated by him and the parking lot is really poorly lit. I am sure the customers walking in were wondering what he was yelling at me about.   I told him I had a right to express my opinion and that I did not use any swear words or threats, just that I was upset at a consistent problem of not getting orders right and also I was not given a receipt. He said he had a right not to have me there. I told him I was going to explain my experience on YELP and he said he didn't care about YELP.   Finally, the food is good at The Stand... but clearly RON does not know how to handle customer complaints or that employees would be called idiots after such continued poor service. And now after being there a couple of years they have not worked out the snags with orders. In my opinion Ron clearly needs to learn some diplomacy in dealing with upset customers. And no worries, I will not be back."}
{"text":"First time visited. I'd heard really great things. My order was incorrect. I called to let them know and they apologized over the phone but then they hung up on me. I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Was better the last time I was here , they offered chips and salsa and had an operable milk shake machine. We were told since they opened another location, they have the items we wanted . Burgers were fair , fries were not good . The place was filled with smoke from what I assume was the deep fryer. The seats have deep wear marks in them and sink down half a foot. Won't return"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on 4/27 was told they were out of milkshakes. Only chocolate. Lame! They have 7 different flavors on their menu."}
{"text":"I treat myself to the stand about once a week and always have the intention of only ordering 2 short rib tacos . Well, I end up with a cheeseburger, fries one of each taco and a milkshake. Hands down the best burger in the valley paired with great service."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!   I cant imagine a better combination....Kick butt burger, some of the best french fries around, short rib tacos and FRESH squeezed lemonade.   First of all the place is adorable, pretty much every simple detail has been thought out down to the vintage coke cooler built into the order counter filled with crushed ice and mexican bottled sodas.   I am not sure how you stand out in todays fancy burger crazy.....Well the folks at THE STAND figured it out. Its all about the details in the food....Nimans Ranch Bacon, quality meat, grilled peppers and onions.   Do yourself a favor, make time for this joint!   Brook"}
{"text":"While The Stand has wonderful burghers, it is too bad they have stopped the tacos. The menu is limited to just the burgher. We used to be able to get the tacos as well, which meant more variety. We were told we could go to the Scottsdale location for tacos, but this makes no sense when we live within walking distance of Indian School Rd."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger I've ever had (and I have had A LOT)! I would eat here every day if I could. The restaurant temperature always runs a little warm, but the staff is super friendly, homemade lemonade is to die for, and Stand Sauce is just too good for words. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Saturday lunch with my son. The place was fairly crowded. Although I think that there were more employees then there were customers.   That said, we share a couple of tacos, a burger, and some fries. All were good. The burger is very much in line with In & Out, Five Guys, or The Habit. Not like what you get a Deluxe or The Grind.   Nice decor, good service, and good food."}
{"text":"Amazing little Mexican place, loved it!  Darn near authentic Mexican, if I may say so.  Everything I ordered was fantastico!"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers but I love tacos.   Went here with a co-worker so he could try a burger and I could try their tacos.     Get there and I ask the girl at the counter how big the tacos are (street taco size or large) so I could know whether to order 2 or 3.    She tells me that \"we're trying something new and not serving tacos\".     OK, so time to take the taco selection off the board and paint over that on the outside wall of the building.   Not sure \"trying something new\" worked out too well."}
{"text":"The BEST local burger joint. Quality ingredients and super friendly staff. Simple menu, but perfect. Cute patio."}
{"text":"Great food...impeccable service...very consistent. Ron (manager) always there checking in to make sure it's all good! Thanks Stand...congratulations Ava...you run a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We waited in line for 5 minutes, no one was in front of us. The cashier came over, said \"let me finish up first...\" which meant she would go back to cleaning the trays instead of taking our order. We left after another 5 minutes, worst customer service I've seen in years. Bummer, it was our first and last time in."}
{"text":"We both had the standard burger with fries and the vanilla shake.  The burger and the toppings were very  good and fresh.  I would rate them better than say The Habit.  The fries and shake were excellent.  The service was also excellent.  If you're looking for a really good $5 burger in a casual setting I can highly recommend The Stand.  Also - the outdoor seating was nice - it had a portable AC blower which made it comfortable on a day where the high had been in the low 100's.  Another benefit was that they weren't blasting music in your ear so you could have a conversation at a normal volume."}
{"text":"This small spot on the side of Indian School is a great burger joint. Haven't tried their tacos, but the burgers, fries, and shakes were all delicious. A bit small inside, and after getting a burger fries and a drink its pricier than some of the other options."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very \"clean\" tasting, very simple menu! Had great lunch and dinner at this place on the same day! Utilized the drive-through, wait was not long at all.  Pretty awesome transaction system too."}
{"text":"AMAZING. The tacos are more than delicious and the service is above your typical fast food joint.  The owners or workers will be sure to stop by your table to check on you, refill drinks, and ensure everything is swell. A detail like that is unexpected in this mega casual sort of setting.   The Stand is very small with only a few tables inside but many more outside on the enclosed patio.  (So on a hot day, sitting outside is not ideal) If you are planning on meeting a group, it may be difficult to find seating. We were only a party of 2 and were lucky enough to grab one of the tables inside on a very hot summer day.  There is a drive-thru as well, if you just want something to go.  If you are looking for one of Phoenix's best new 'hole-in-the-wall\" joints, this is it!  Update: still a fan but knocked off one star bc i dont think the burgers are out of this world. They messed up our simple order--twice in one trip.  I'd go back for the tacos, somewhere else for a burger probably."}
{"text":"\"Do Fries Go With That Shake!\"  Sorry In-N-Out Burger you have been replaced! Arcadia's latest addition, The Stand , is my new favorite neighborhood hang out!  They make good classic American food . . . .fast!  Fast, Cheap, & Tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of hole in the wall places to eat, but after the first bite I was hooked! Best banana shakes in town, and the burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"OMG!!  The street corn is to die for!!  Can I get the recipe!!  The burgers are great also!"}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic. The dulce de leche shake is top notch. Its like an in and out burger only upscale. Ample parking"}
{"text":"We're pretty picky about a good burger and traveling through Phoenix, just stopped here for dinner and it's so good. Like a classic burger stand from my childhood but way better ingredients. The beef was flavorful, everything was perfect and the 5th star is for the strawberry lemonade, top notch customer service, every employee was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the Stand burger is probably the best burger in AZ! I have been here so many times and love the food, but the last couple of times have been terrible for customer service. Tonight I went out of my way to head over and stood I line for over 10 minutes. I was 2nd in line. They weren't that busy, but their process flow is TERRIBLE! The girl taking orders would take an order then walk around prepare the drinks and then do other stuff and disappear. The line just kept growing, meanwhile they're taking all the phone orders before attending to us in line here in the building . I waited and then a guy came up to the register to finish another phone order and the line kept growing. Just terrible, I'm all for attending to phone orders but you have to take care of people there in your building with some priority. I wish the service was better or that they actually had some process flow considering there were 8 employees here hat I counted so I don't think they were understaffed by any means. Just really disappointed"}
{"text":"I've just gotten back from my second visit to The Stand and feel inclined to update my first 5 star review to a 4, now having gotten over my \"first date\" giddiness and tried the tacos.  As promised, I went back today to try them (tacos). Well, they weren't as nearly as good as I had hoped. I ordered one short rib ($3) and one chicken ($2.50), along with another burger (yes, I'm a glutton).  Neither taco came even close to knocking my socks off. Don't get me wrong, both were good, but thats it. The short rib taco was the better of the two, mainly because of the addition of the cotija cheese which was the most flavorful part of either of them.  Both were shredded meat and neither had that punch of flavor I (and every one else) is looking for in a taco. The chicken was a little grainy with much too fine of a shred with almost no flavor. Put some seasoning on that thing!  Short rib is short rib, nearly always great, but theirs lacked that succulent richness that I look for with that type of meat.   They also ask if you want mild or hot salsa ON the taco. I asked for the hot, but on the side because I didn't want the salsa to take over and I had no idea if it was good or not. Boy, I'm glad I asked for it on the side. It is chunky SALSA, not a smooth hot SAUCE, which i prefer on a taco. Excellent for chips, but not on my taco, and it was nowhere NEAR the realm of spicy. My Mom could eat bowls of the stuff.  Considering two stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", these are definately a two. With places like Gallo Blaco out there, the taco battle is a tough one to enter, nearly as tough as the bigger burger war that they have also entered.  I did get a cheeseburger that was as good as the first. Quite good and fresh tasting, and a 5 star burger, but only because of the price point.  Service is also excellent. In fact, couldn't be better with them clearing your plate when you finish and having smiles all around. Definitely 5 stars for that. The place was MUCH busier than last week which is a good thing.  Keep your charm, The Stand. I'll be back, but its burgers only from now on.  A side note... I think us Yelpers can sometimes be TOO picky. I'm guilty of it too for sure. We want EVERY burger to be the best we've ever had, every taco to leave us speachless. Well. I'm not sure that every place is meant for that, or even tries for that. How many stars does good food at a good price garner...? With the competition out there can a place like that even stay in buisness? I dunno. Just something for me to think about I guess.  PS - I do agree that adding the choice of green chilis or a fried egg would be a spendid option. I too and am absolute whore for a fried egg on a burger."}
{"text":"Burgers fine to good. Shakes good. Inside service fine. Drive through service is AWFUL! Pulled in tonight, 2 cars in line in front of me and no one at the speaker. Waited 10 minutes without any acknowledgement. Saw the car around the corner move forward still no acknowledgement. Yelled at speaker, no reply. Waited a minute more and pulled forward assuming speaker was dead. As I am pulling away I hear someone welcoming me to the Stand and asking me to please wait. The young lady running the drive through 2/19/2018 @ 6:40PM needs to be trained or let go because when a vehicle pulls up it should be immediately acknowledged (especially since there drive through is not properly designed to support being close to the speaker). I went inside to place my order and there was 1 person in the place. The internal staff were proficient and the food did not take long to cook. The food is good here but the prices they charge are close to what I pay at other sit down burger franchises on Camelback.  The Stand was my go to place for convenience since it was a quality burger with a drive through. If they can't fix the drive through they should shut it down completely."}
{"text":"We came here because they were pet friendly and Kylie brought out a bowl of water for our puppy without even being asked. She took our orders so we could stay with the dog and even passed on some rubs to the pup. Now the food, the stands burger is soooo tasty with bacon so thick you can't go wrong. The fries are crispy and the special sauce us pretty good. I wish I lived closer I would never eat a burger from anywhere else. Thanks Kylie for great service and going the extra mile."}
{"text":"I felt like its was a cute little burger joint.   I honestly don't think their burgers are all that nor their tacos.  The service is good though and it's cute place but not the food.   Mr he tacos were not appetizing and the burger was just ok.  I think Burger King whooper is better.   I just don't know the hype really.  I drove here for the reviews and it was such a miss."}
{"text":"Saw a review on fry bread. Saw that it was a outdoor basic place with incredible fry bread. All is true. Super nice people. Best fry bread ever. Things you should know. Open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. From around 11:00 until after lunch. Bring cash. Need to eat in car or take with you. Really basic maybe 6 items and soda. Closed if raining hard since not much of a cover over the kitchen. I can not wait until Monday to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in town! It's super cute and tastefully decorated. Very excellent customer service. The menu is super simplistic and easy to order from. The burgers were jam packed with flavor and the bacon was the best, plus their homemade drinks were perfect! We were very pleased with everyone and everything! Definitely coming back thank you guys for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Came from Surprise with wife and was excited to try the Burger and Mexican street corn... Guess what they don't serve it at this location and they also don't serve Street tacos  here either... Felt like I was getting an overpriced in and out burger... $2.99 for a large drink and the small drink was $2.49 for my wife... Two hamburgers and two drinks One Fry $22.19 plus tax... Disappointed  After consulting with my wife we were talking about our experience and the lack of taste of the burgers... She said she would rather lick one of our cats feet after it got out of the litter box"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY slow service. If you want to wait 25 minutes for a burger and a taco, this is your place. What a waste of time and the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"This Place was really good.. The Standard burger which was really the only burger was very juicy and delicious.. My husband and I both added bacon, cheese, caramelized onions and grilled jalapeños(very hot because they leave the seeds in) making just the burger alone 9$.. Add fries 3$ and milkshakes that are 4.50$ a piece and for me, my husband, and my daughter, it cost 50$ which is pretty steep for burgers fries and milkshakes.. But the service and friendliness of the staff was above and beyond amazing and for that alone I would come back..."}
{"text":"So. I actually enjoyed The Stand. However, I think it's overpriced. There are so many delicious places that serve up good, meaty burgers that paying $25 for two burger meals hurt a little. I did enjoy the burger though and I was kind of meh on the fries. One thing that really got me excited was their strawberry lemonade. Its seasonal but it's so tart and sweet and fresh that it's totally worth going there for."}
{"text":"Dined in for lunch with a friend.  There's very limited seating but I managed to grab one of the booths thanks to fortunate timing (and a nice employee asked me if she could wipe it down too).  Limited parking too, but again I had good timing and someone backed out as I pulled in.  There was a pretty good sized group in line ahead of us (five people or so), but the cashier was competent.  The food was delivered pretty fast as well, and I appreciated how many people they had working behind the counter.  Standard burger: The two thinner patties together provided a lot of meat!  The taste was similar to In-n-Out or a meatier, firmer Sonic.  It was okay, but I don't love well-done beef.  Bun was fine, cheese seemed like standard American.  Fries: My generous buddy gave me some of his order of these.  They had a really great herb mix (very similar to Smash Burger's fries) sprinkled on top.  The fries themselves again reminded me of In-N-Out in their shape and texture.  I don't care for how small and greasy they are, and they only taste good when they are hot.  Not bad though, and the server was nice enough to bring extra ketchup (and a bigger water cup for me, which I was grateful for as theirs are ridiculously tiny).  Salted Caramel Shake: Amazing.  This was SO good!  I loved how salty it was.  It had generous ribbons of caramel that I scraped off the side of the cup with my straw afterwards.  It was just the right size, and I appreciated the extra wide, extra strong straw that could handle the thick shake.  Their pricing is very affordable at a solid fast-casual level (more than Sonic, WAY less than Ingo's and Zinburger).  Their pricing is actually HALF of what Zinburger charges for their more basic burgers!  With that in mind, I appreciate this place for what it is: A cheaper alternative to the \"fancy burger\" places, and a solid \"better burger\" restaurant."}
{"text":"The drive-thru was ridiculously slow for a weekday night. No reason why it should have taken that long. In-N-Out has faster service. So don't go unless you are willing to wait.  We asked for a side of Stand Sauce and didn't receive it, so we had to turn around and get it. 50 cents for the equivalent of a ketchup packet... no thanks. It's ripped off spread, anyway.  The burgers were okay, but they kind of crumbled while we ate them. The fries were tasteless, greasy, and undercooked. I liked my gluten-free bun and jalapenos, but they weren't worth the additional charge.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular. The Stand is obviously trying to reinvent the wheel, and mostly fails miserably. Just go to In-N-Out, where you know you'll get good service, a correct order, and good food."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and like the staff.  (They could use a little more personality - not quite like Dutch Brother coffee, but maybe a smile or two..)  They were a little quick to close the patio on a Sunday.  So we had to fend for ourselves to take a seat.  We laughed as 4 different staff people tried to get out the locked patio door, until one wise one finally decided to unlock the door.  The burgers a just like In & Out Burgers.  Very delish."}
{"text":"We have just died and found our new favorite, heavenly hamburger joint.  Their standard burger is picture perfect and even more perfectly delicious. Stand sauce is the bomb. Their French fries are magnificent... And they make them in house of course :) if you're lucky and the heavens are Smiling down on you... you'll find a potato end that is fried up like a golden nugget in the mix. You can't help but smile while you eat!  The staff is so incredibly cheerful and pleasant... Making sure everything is clean and orderly around the small restaurant.  Even when it was busy, the staff seamlessly acknowledged every guest walking in and out, without skipping a beat for the existing patrons.  The patio is adorable and intimate. Bike racks in front for the neighborhood peeps like us, but a decent size parking lot out back for the rest. No fear if your in a hurry... They have drive thru !  Such a wonderful find in the neighborhood ! GO! RUN! EAT AT THE STAND !!!!  #yourewelcome"}
{"text":"We have been traveling across America and hands down the best burger we have had in any state. The shakes are super thick and tasty. Outstanding food, outstanding service and all around just AWESOME. Will return again some day."}
{"text":"burger is good the service is OK I would say in on the pricey side for the size of the burger but still tasty very simple witch is nice will be back hopefully I can add a party"}
{"text":"Tasty burger here I like what they do! Also have fancy ice cream shakes. The French fries are different but all around good experience burger :) yummy"}
{"text":"Great burgers but superb chicken tacos. Will definitely be back again for more tacos. The ingredients on the burger and tacos were very fresh, but I've had a better burger in town by other local restaurants. Overall great place with a quaint atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Well, I found The Stand on the web after searching for a place in the PHX area that might have brisket tacos.  The short rib tacos sounded equally as good and I decided to make the trek from N Scottsdale to The Stand.  Being a late Saturday morning, I expected the weekend lunch crowd.    My eyes might've been a little bigger than my stomach, however I ordered two short rib tacos and one chicken taco and a side of fries.  To say the least, it was worth my trip to The Stand for the tacos as well as the fries that remind me more of Five Guys fries, however with much more flavor.  The manager, Miranda, came out to see how my meal was.  She stayed to talk for a second, noticing that I was a \"newbie\" to The Stand and she was very genuine in her conversation with me (not fake and \"checking off the box with the customer\" like a lot of other places).  In my opinion, The Stand is worth the trip from any part of town and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, loved the fries, the burger was amazing also. Definitely pay for the grilled banana peppers and the banana milk shake. Great service, not a huge line, a tad expensive but definitely worth it for a quality burger."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good and fries were salty and greasy and delicious!  I tried the chicken and short rib variations of the taco. Both were satisfying. The price for a burger and couple of tacos?  $20! A bit overpriced! And they are out of lemonade?!?!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fresh. Nice people. A little pricey. Won't stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"Adorable little shack with a cute set up. We were recommended my a friend so we went to check it out. It was good food but nothing I would consider making the 40 mile drive for again.  Everything was fresh and made quick. No complaints just nothing that stood out. Visually appealing as well, again just nothing that was extravagant to make us frequent."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was 5 star. From the service, ambiance, burger, fries and shake. I ordered the standard with cheese, bacon and grilled onions with fries and a dulche milk shake. The cheeseburger to butter bun ratio was perfect with the stand sauce just made it even better. The fries were cooked perfectly crispy and the stand sauce it came with for dipping added great flavor. The shake was creamy and deliciously smooth. My wife had the strawberry lemonade and she said it was one of the best she's had."}
{"text":"So good and super fresh! The tacos and milk shakes are great too! Only thing is everything is ordered al la carte and the seating is limited, they get super busy so wait time and prices are high. But the staff is always friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for late lunch and had one of those moments where I keep asking myself throughout my meal \"why hadn't I tried one of these burgers before?\"  We came to eat during off hours about 3:30 PM so there wasn't any waiting or a line so it was perfect timing on our part. The place is literally a stand. A quaint little casita on Indian School surrounded by a some other restaurants and a drive through that was busy the whole time we were eating there.  We both ordered a cheeseburger and fries. We had envisioned that it would be just a single patty cheeseburger so imagine what happened when we got served our hot juicy burgers and found two patties between the perfectly toasted buns and melted cheese?  We were stoked.  I knew I shouldn't be eating a burger this size (it was big to me) but after one bite I couldn't imagine not eating the whole burger.  We could not believe the quality or the taste of this burger. This was hands down the best burger we have had in Phoenix to date. It was hot through and through, every bite was full of flavor and meaty juiciness and of course the cheese perfectly melted and the tomato, onion and lettuce were perfect additions to the burger.  Even though our server told us that the burger would be cooked medium well, this burger was juicy through and through. I love this burger and can't believe it took me seven months to find a burger this delicious and lovingly made. It was out of this world and just like how I imagined if I had paid some fancy Food Network chef to cook one for me. It was that good.  No wonder they get all these \"best of, \" awards. Absolutely deserved.  As far as service, the front of the house staff ringing up our order and serving us were friendly and helpful and quick to bring out our food.  Can't wait until next time, as this is our new favorite burger place in Arizona."}
{"text":"I used to love their burgers, crave them, drive halfway across town for one.  I moved into the area a few months ago and was giddy about being so close.  Sadly though the last three visits were terribly disappointing.  What happened to their juicy burgers?  What happened to seasoning the burgers?  The Stand used to remind me of the killer burgers that my dad used to make.  Flavorful, unctuous, sinful, memorable.  But now the quality is subpar.  The meat is disrespected and over cooked and under seasoned.  And now they've taken tacos off the menu?  Sad.  I feel like this location is gearing up for closure.  It's as if no one who works there cares about quality.  It's a shame that it's become what it has."}
{"text":"Kylie is an awesome employee. She went out of her way to make a shake when they were just about out of ice cream. Amazing shakes! Great food! GREAT SERVICE."}
{"text":"Insanely good. Love this place so much. Shakes are definitely the main attraction here but the food was epic too. Chicken tacos for days bruh."}
{"text":"The Stand is my go to place for a good burger."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers, shakes, fries, tacos, etc... Service was very good as well. A great local joint that we will be happy to frequent. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointing- after reading some positive reviews I was anxious to give them a try. From ice cold, mushy Mexican corn- to cold, strangely seasoned chicken tacos. One redeeming item was my husbands cheeseburger. It was hot and the burger itself was juicy. We ate the burger and threw away the rest."}
{"text":"The salted caramel shake is seriously the best.  As a fellow yelper previously wrote, that it was the best thing she ever had the pleasure of sucking down - I would have to say I wholeheartedly agree.  And it comes with a big straw to allow for extra quick suckage.    I got the short rib tacos which were okay, it's not something I can see myself craving in the near future, but I ate the fries my coworker ordered and I absolutely love the seasoning on 'em.  I definitely will come back to try the burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers are done right, with that gooey cheese melting over the patty and fresh ingredients. The fries are some of my favorite, perfectly cooked and seasoned just right. Prices are a bit high, I wanted to get some additional toppings and a milkshake with my meal but couldn't justify the additional cost."}
{"text":"SO MUCH NOM. Their burgers are hard to beat. They are extremely similar in flavor to in-n-out but with just a little more finesse in preparation. I get mine on a gluten free bun which is better than any other gf bun I've ever had on a burger. It's soft, toasted really nicely and with all the delicious ingredients in between I almost forget it's even gluten free. I've gotta say I'm not crazy about the tacos but I crave these burgers constantly. It's a rare gem to find a drive through place with such high quality ingredients and really decent prices. I've never had any issues with customer service, everyone I've dealt with has been extremely pleasant. Any one who hates on their burgers is delusional.  If you're feeling naughty get the dulce de leche shake, it's ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Juicy, flavorful, real hamburgers are what you get here. Always busy and rightly so. When you can offer one burger, the standard, and draw in a line of people both in the restaurant and the drive thru, you have something special. Do yourself a favor and get a standard, dress it up with fire roasted peppers, bacon, cheese and a hand spun shake and thank me later."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a burger and tried the standard with cheese and added the jalapenos. I loved the burger and it was definitely one of the best burgers I have had lately. The service here was exceptional, they seemed like they really wanted to be sure I was happy and it worked, They came out and gave me a free sample of their banana shake while I was eating and it was really good. I'll definitely eat here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  I had two tacos (but they were sold out of chicken so I was a bit sad about that).  Kids each had burgers, and one side of fries to share, and lemonades.  The menu is limited but they do it well; some of the up charges add up, and it gets quite busy, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Consistently tasty, in & out-inspired burgers and service. Tacos are tasty, also, but I tend to visit here just for burgers/fries as I prefer to get street tacos elsewhere where they taste similar but cheaper! Horchata is also very good. It's a pretty higher priced drive-thru."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food, but The Stand burgers are awesome!  My whole family is addicted to this place.  We go at least once a week.  My only request is that they get their fries to be more consistent.  Many times they are over cooked and I prefer them not so crispy.  Hands down, stand burgers are best in town."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes.  The standard burger is good and you can upgrade it with cheese, jalapeños and bacon.   The Banana Stand Shake is great.  Try it with chocolate ice cream. In addition to great shakes, they have Coke products, Mexican Coke and beer.  Personally I prefer the shakes."}
{"text":"The Stand is a nice change-of-pace burger / taco option for Phoenix downtowners and hipsters and those of us who aren't zombies. The Stand is awesome for folks with food allergies. I was in there and the owner was explaining his sensitivity towards people with food allergies because of his own personal (family) challenges.   5 stars for the customer service. 4.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the prices.  It's a locally owned business, so I'll continue to support it!"}
{"text":"The Stand is simply delicious!!!! They will hook you up with amazing tacos, impressive burgers and all natural fries. This place is a must visit!! The service is phenomenal, ever so friendly as well as informative!! This places delivers quality and value!! My favorite is the Standard with cheese, it includes two house-ground patties offering crisp hand-leafed lettuce, fresh tomato, sliced onion, crinkle cut dill pickles, american cheese and their special stand sauce with added grilled jalapeño peppers. AMAZINGLY GREAT!! Oh and lets not forget the side of fresh cut fries and an iced cold Horchata.  SIMPLY PERFECT!! :)"}
{"text":"I typically order to go and have always been pleased with the food; usually ordering the veggie tacos for myself and a cheese burger for my boyfriend. For the last few years I have been dying to try the corn, but I was always told it was out of season. Finally I went a few nights ago and was now told it was taken off the menu and used at their location in Scottsdale. My only request is that if you list this as a seasonal item and have now chosen to take it off the menu, please physically take it off."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to The Stand since we started dating, and recently they catered our wedding.  It was an incredible experience.  The servers were kind, professional, and helpful, the truck itself was adorable, and the food was amazing.  Everyone we spoke to told us it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. The office manager, Kim, who helped us plan our event, was also kind and professional, and made the experience much less stressful than it could have been.  We highly recommend The Stand for your every day meals, and for your special events."}
{"text":"The Stand is conveniently located by work so I decided to try it today. Right off the bat, I'm yelling as close as I can to the drive thru speaker because the girl taking my order can't hear me. But clearly, I can hear all the noise coming from inside which is making it hard for her to hear me. The speaker box is up high how am I suppose to get close? I drive up to the window and I get no salutation and don't even get noticed for almost 10 minutes. There were no other cars in line. And it was just after 12pm. Finally get my order.  Tacos not too bad. They're suppose to come with salsa, neither one of my tacos had any salsa. I also ordered chips and salsa on the side, the tiny containers are ridiculous. These containers are the kind you see at other places where you pack salsa to go. In my opinion, the salsa was not enough. The chips are tasty but a little hard to chew. First few were nice and crunchy, then they started getting dull and greasy.  I like supporting local businesses, but not sure I'll return. Good luck."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out last night after continuing to hear about it. One word describes it for me \"Excellent\". The food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the burger, fries, short rib taco, and the chicken taco and one of those delicious shakes. Can't complain about any of those items. The tacos really put it over the top for me. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and everybody is super nice. The decor is a mix between modern and old school burger joint. Absolutely great place! This will definitely be a spot we visit frequently."}
{"text":"This little burger joint really stole my heart... or should I say stomach? This small burger \"stand\" was pretty busy early on Saturday night and I can see why.  I found the service/atmosphere to be great.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, which is always a plus.  So, most importantly, the food. I found the burger to be perfect. The bun was soft, the meat was cooked just right.  There was a great meat to cheese ratio, and the pickles and sauce really added the right touch.  The fries were also delish.  Seasoned well and the \"stand sauce\" was zingy and great with the fries.  Didn't have shake, but I'll be back to try one of these bad boys soon.  Almost everyone around us has one and they all looked great.  I also had a bite of the short rib taco, which was good, but for me the burger is where it was at.  Definitely be talking about this place for awhile. It's a good thing for my waistline it's not too close to home..."}
{"text":"Had the standard burger with cheese and wife had the standard burger with grilled onions. They were fantastic. Also had a strawberry lemonade which was fantastic.   Are the meal inside which isn't huge but the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Bring a bib and a smile.   The juiciest burger I've ever had, almost like a hamburger Au Jus sandwich. The downside is that it's quite the mess, but it's seriously adds to your quality of life to come here occasionally.   Other downside is the size of the restaurant there really is no room and you will have to wait, but this is a great change of pace to any of the chains out there."}
{"text":"The stand is a great place to grab a burger but even better if you need a shake. The shakes are the best part of this place hands down. My only complaint would be that it is a bit pricey. A friend of mine said he didn't like the tacos too much I didn't give them a chance."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than small shops that do it right. This small burger shop has a small menu but the ingredients and quality of service is worthy of the rating. The have some great shakes and gluten free buns too. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. They have drive thru too for those looking to get in and out."}
{"text":"I like their menu, almost as simple as In & Out burger.  Since Ricky's Big Philly closed for awhile, I haven't ate a burger that I like.  This burger not as good as Ricky's  but it tastes better than many chain store or restaurants.    The downside I would say is the fries, it is a little too skinny and over fried, some are burned.  Hope the will improve the fries, so it won't get wasted.    I will definitely go back for the burger, maybe fries at somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Drive thru gourmet burger place? hell yah! Stopped here a few times while I was going to my weekly appointment nearby and was very impressed.. I've only ever ordered the burger.. add the yummy Niman Ranch bacon (extra, but seriously worth it) and I'm in la la land!  Their staff is very friendly and the food is made to order, seasoned *perfectly* and above all, delicious.  OH yeah, the fries are awesome... perfectly seasoned and just like I like them."}
{"text":"Hamburgers and fries rock! Shakes are awesome but not a fan of the the tacos. I tried the tacos once again to see if my opinion would change but no it did not."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on The Stand right now. We have been loyal Stand customers since they opened. The burgers and fries are typically amazing and so are the shakes. I love the salted caramel!   My husband and I got off work late last Friday night and decided to pick up some food around 10pm (I think they close at 11pm). We got it home and it was  absolutely horrible. The fries were tiny little soggy, greasy pieces and the burgers did not taste fresh either. The whole meal was very unappetizing and at $20 for two burgers and fries majorly disappointing. We wrote it off as a fluke since it was late, although we have gotten delicious food there late at night many other occasions.  We went again today and although the burgers were close to normal, the fries were absolutely horrible again. They were all brown, greasy, over cooked, soggy, and barely edible.   We are small business owners ourselves and have been going to The Stand for about 2 years with no issues, so we were really trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. My husband called and let them know about our recent experiences. The employee who answered did not seem concerned. We asked if anything had changed about the fries, is there something we need to mention when we order to not get old, greasy fries? And return to the normally delicious, crispy, well seasoned ones? The employee said that they just have bad potatoes right now and there's nothing they can do to change the current quality of the fries. Bad potatoes?? For a place that prides itself on fresh ingredients I'm not understanding how a subpar quality of potato would be used for over a week. Moreover, I don't know how the quality of the potato could be affecting the amount of grease and lack of freshness of said fries.  Sadly, we will not be returning for awhile..."}
{"text":"From the outside The Stand appear to be a dive yet it's a hidden gem in the Phoenix area, the service was excellent that you Kiera really seemed to know a lot about the menu"}
{"text":"I discovered the stand a few summers ago. It was the newest addition of eats to the my then neighborhood. The Stand is a local owned foodie shop. The Owner is a super nice dude & he's usually working right up front with staff which I think is dope.   My favorite things to order are the chicken tacos & fries. The absolute best milkshake on the menu is the caramelized salted dulce de leche!  The menu is a tad bit pricy.. You can end up spending 20 dollars easy. Overall dope spot to go on a summer afternoon."}
{"text":"Very simple and clean menu. This place specializes in a handful of items and them do them all very well. I had driven past here a million times and always wanted to go in and I regret waiting this long. I tried the cheese burger, chocolate shake, and fries. Each item was great. The shake was much better than most I have tried around town. The burger was fantastic! perfect ingredients and meat all served on a fresh bun (which might have been a Hawaiian bun). My only complaint would be that it took me 15 minutes to get through the drive thru even though there were only 2 cars ahead of mine.  I will definitely be back and go inside sometime!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Arizona!! The taste really fresh! The lemonade is soooo good! The best fries I have ever had! Love the stand!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! I had my boyfriend pick one up for me when I have a burger craving. It's not too heavy and not cheap with the meat. Mine was with cheese, bacon and sautéed onions. So good, it took me an hour to eat because each bite was delicious. I'm giving 4 stars because the fries were a bit raw. Maybe next time they'll be better."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. Cute shabby shack feel outside but clean and neat inside. Small menu but everything looks good.  Today i opted for a short rib taco and a chicken taco with pico de gallo. Pretty decent size and the meat were covered with two tacos. My only complain is that the short rib taco sauce tasted really salty... Almost too salty.. The flavor is almost good tho. Chicken taco was pretty good as well. Got the hand cut fries, again great flavor but the kitchen put too much seasoning that it was crusting on the side of the plate.  I wanna try their burgers again. My experience wasnt the best but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and twice with a Deal Chicken. The tacos are okay if you're looking for a more upscale fast food taco. The burger is delicious. All the right toppings come together! One suggestion: I wished they would serve a single patty burger. Then I may be more likely to add fries or a shake. But after not being able to finish or truly enjoy either after eating the burger, I'm more likely to just get the burger in the future and call it a meal. Plus, I usually treat myself with a burger and don't eat them regularly, so one beef patty is enough to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that I love a good Burger, so I see this place on-line and decide to check it out, as i enter the restaurant I am greeted with a big hello and welcome which was a very good feeling, I proceeded to order from the simple menu and ordered the standard Burger with cheese and caramelized onion's and a order of fries, I was pleasantly impressed with the quality and freshness of the meat and the bun, the fries were hand cut and very good also, I would give this place a high 4 and maybe a low 5, only reason for the 4 is there isn't much seating and if you get your order to go it's not wrapped to tight, package is left open. love the Burger...JC"}
{"text":"My second time trying this place and both times have been delicious. The first time I ordered the short rib taco, chicken taco, and street corn. The meat on both tacos were a little dry but a good size. I love street corn and was happy with all the toppings they included: butter, cotija cheese, green onions, mayo, and a chile powder.   The second time I ordered the burger, fries, and chips and guac. I absolutely love their burger! I got it with cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted jalepenos ($.75 extra charge) and it was one of the best burgers I've ever gotten at a drive-thru! If you get the burger, you MUST get the fries because they are freshly cut and seasoned to perfection. Be prepared to be full afterward, also. The guac is different; there is corn mixed in, which gives it sweet and tangy flavors all in one. I liked it! Definitely love this place but would get the burger over the tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers with good quality beef taste.  1/2 Chocolate 1/2 Vanilla Shake was awesome.  The Real Deal!  Staff was very courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Food was great had a Standard Burger with the Salty Dulce de Leche Shake!! Staff was super cool and will be back to try the short rib tacos for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped by The Stand and I ordered two tacos ... the chicken taco & the vegetarian taco along with a side of fries. I wasn't much of a fan of either taco but the fries were pretty good. I understand having a simple, small menu, but it goes without saying that then, the items on the menu have to be amazing. It would've been nice to see a grilled chicken option in the burger category.  As far as the service goes, however, they're really nice and efficient at moving through the line and getting orders out. I wish I liked the food more because it really is a great concept!"}
{"text":"Dulce de leche milkshakes. Words can not describe the delicious experience you are in for. Just try it."}
{"text":"Come for the overpriced, mediocre tacos. Stay for the atrocious service! First (and last) time for me at this place. Went through the drive thru and after being told to wait a minute by the speaker, I waited over 5 minutes to place my order. Also, the order was wrong. And in a town with truly outstanding street tacos, these are not remotely worth $3 per taco. Maybe the burgers are better. I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Sort of ironic, the standard burger is pretty much just that. Don't get me wrong it was a really good burger but nothing really stood out. I wish i would have tried the short rib tacos. The fries were good. Ultimately If I had to choose between this and In & out, well...."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I've been to! Super quick, simple menu! Lots of flavor! Be careful cause it can get messy! Overall a great place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Only problem I've had here was that I was eating, I looked at my phone for a second and out of nowhere came a hand and just took my plate away without asking if I was done."}
{"text":"A quint hidden gem in the Phoenix area! Walking up, I did not expect much. It is very small and doesn't exactly have \"curb appeal\". After walking in my opinion changed quite fast. Very clean, and chic spot! The menu was very basic, but you can tell they'd rather focus on a few items, and do them well...and they did! Great service, and good food. No complaints, and will be returning!"}
{"text":"It is a cool \"burger joint\" that brings back some old school Americana style memories. You almost expect to see a couple of Bel Airs and 1st gen Camaro's out in the lot!  The burgers, fries and the drinks are intensely flavored. I was shocked at how every bite defined a flavorful meaning where after the meal I was convinced that I had to try the milkshake (something I never do) and let me tell you, it was just as awesome as the rest of the food.  Nice and roomy outdoor seating and right next door to an AMC movie theater makes it a real convenient experience - a one stop shop date!  I took out a star for the pricing, I know it's a great location and the upkeep must be high but the portions do not justify the pricing - enough to make me bring it up, it's a $12 burger in a \"burger joint\".  Either then that they have some nice little hidden items from Mexico like real cane sugar mexican cola in a glass bottle, sign me up!"}
{"text":"So glad to be back in AZ at the Stand for the best burgers in the Valley. Can't wait to try the Grand Stand and have the street tacos."}
{"text":"do yourself a favor get a sack of the short rib tacos and a burger for dessert!! you can thank me later"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not gormet either. Really close to in-n-out but maybe a step up. They do however charge for ketchup apparently which in my opinion is bad business and a whole lot of bull shit.."}
{"text":"It's just a little hole-in-the-wall but The Stand is a great place to go if you want a good burger, fries, and a Mexican Coke with real sugar.  However, I'm only giving them three stars because of the fact that they no longer serve tacos at this location. I was a big fan of their tacos so I was disappointed to find that they are no longer available. Apparently they have decided to sell burgers on Indian School and tacos at their new location at Scottsdale and Shea. What, why don't you sell both items at both locations? They're both good, but neither one requires specialty equipment.  That being said, if you want a burger go here, but just don't expect to get tacos."}
{"text":"We had a mini lunch - we split a great burger and chocolate shake! Shakes are amazing here!"}
{"text":"The short rib tacos were very good, almost a little sweet but very good none the less. I do wish the hot tacos were a bit spicier but everyone's palette is different. The chips and salsa were pretty phenomenal, freshly cooked chips and salsa spicy enough to stand up and take notice. The one thing that really brings the rating down is price, for the size of the taco, I think they were a little pricey. Model customer service means I would go back"}
{"text":"Great burger joint with cool outdoor seating. What makes this place so famous in my mind are their shakes. The Chocolate banana is incredible but the salted caramel shake is out of this world. Pair one of these shakes with some French fries and a burger, you'll be quite pleased."}
{"text":"The 'Stand'ard two-patty burger is the only sandwich item on the menu. The Stand claims to grind their own beef fresh. You order at the counter - food is delivered. Probably twelve or so tables or seating areas with both indoor and outdoor seating. If you sit outdoors, note you will be next to Indian School road so it can get a little noisy but it's nice cozy and private area . I had the S'tand'ard with cheese - my wife had the 'Stand'ard without cheese. Comes with all toppings lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and special mayo-ketchup blend sauce. Great tasting and moist burger (although well-done) and the bun/toppings were fresh. Plenty of burger for the average person. We also ordered one order of FFs. One is a good sized order and the Stand uses shoe string fries (my favorite) and it seem like they double fry them - because they were hot and very crispy. So if you like your fries thin and crispy make sure you get an order. Would definitely recommend the stand for a quick bite when in the area. My wife and I would certainly both go again."}
{"text":"The best thing on the menu? - Burgers? - NO, Fries? - NO, Shakes? - NO... so what is it, you ask? Without a doubt, without hesitation, or fear of contradiction, the absolute best thing on their menu - and it's only there for a few months each summer - is their homemade Lemonade. Really?! Yes! I drive far out of my way just to get it, and I pester them with phone calls several times each spring asking them if they've started making it yet. They have a classic lemonade and often a seasonal lemonade such as peach lemonade, both of which are not just to die for, but are addictive. Yes, I know you've had lemonade before, but not like this. Warning - it is probably the most tart lemonade you will ever drink and it is sweet, but it's flavor is so strong that it makes your eyes roll to the back of your head in delight. With their peach version, you'd swear you were eating a peach. You take that drink and say \"boy that was tart\" and you stop, then almost immediately, uncontrollably you must have more and it goes on like this until even their large size is totally gone. Trust me - tart, sweet, addictive. The best you'll ever try. Now if I can only get them to keep it on the menu all year round!"}
{"text":"I ordered fries, gf burger w/o cheese, and a dulce de leche shake. The fries were tasty! I am a fan of fries with seasoning. I may have to go on a heist to steal it from the restaurant or maybe just bribe the guy at the drive-through for the secret?? The burger was more than enough to eat as a meal by itself with two patties and lots of fresh toppings. The meat was well seasoned and juicy, so wear a bib if you eat it in the car. I had burger juice all over my shirt even though it's wrapped in paper. I had to hide my shirt from my dog when I picked her up from daycare. That was the best milkshake I've ever had! The catch: I don't like milkshakes, not even the ones I've made in my home, and I don't order them from restaurants. In fact, I'm lactose intolerant. However, I saw so many pics of this on yelp that I had to try it because..... Now I'm no glutton, but ever since I had that meal (which was incredibly filling by the way), I've been dreaming about going back to get another milkshake and more fries. I almost went back the next day but was afraid the guy at the drive-thru might recognize me. Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a big menu but they execute what they do really well and the staff is awesome!   Great place"}
{"text":"Great mom & pop burger joint.  This place is literally a stand,  a little hut with a drive thru.  But it cranks our hot delicious huge burgers!  Love it!"}
{"text":"So my family and I went to this little burger  joint after reading the awesome reviews on Yelp and driving by numerous times. Thank you yelpers! You didn't disappoint!!! The atmosphere is very cool. Fresh ingredients all around. The owner, this giant who has to duck to walk out of the kitchen, strolls around the front and back of the restaurant and HELPS his staff. We ordered a burger a piece a couple baskets of fries to share (huge portions) and two salted dulce shakes, I opted for diet coke and to try a taco. The burgers were off the chain!!!! They were juicy and flavorful! The shake was so thick it came with a special tube(not a straw) to suck on! The taco was dry , but if u like a good rubbed beef taco u will live it. I went really for the burger so I'm still happy. As we are the giant owner came out and chatted it up with us. You could hear how proud he was of the place and his desire to serve fresh , good tasting food to HIS neighborhood! We will be back!!!  Definitely a stop you must make when diving through Arcadia."}
{"text":"This should be a five star review.  The ingredients seem very fresh.  The fries are great (as is the fry sauce), the prices aren't exorbitant...so what's the problem?  Flavor, that's the problem.  There was NO flavor.  I could tell they were using good quality meat based on the texture, but it was the most bland burger I've ever had in my life.  I thought, \"Maybe it's just my burger.  Every place can mess one up.\" so I tried my wife's burger.  Nope.  Bland. Flavorless.  Missing any manner of savoriness.    She gave up about halfway through hers, so I picked her burger up, removed the bun and toppings, and just tasted the beef by itself.  Yup...great texture, not an ounce of flavor.  So I picked up another chunk, grabbed the salt shaker and poured literally 4 grains of salt on the chunk of meat.  Not a bunch, only four goddamned crystals.    Holy shit, I could suddenly taste the beef!  There was flavor!  It was buttery and rich!  What the fuck?  Did they skip salt?  I don't want a salty burger or anything but crap, use SOME.  We agreed there was literally nothing there that would make that burger win over a damn In N Out Burger.  I don't understand all these accolades...you can use the best ingredients in the world but if you refuse to give it flavor, there's no point."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a treat to come... I don't live near this location, so it's fun to come. Love their dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Amazing pudding milk shakes!! Woops was I supposed to say that out loud!? Banana nana,nana,oh,nana,banana,nana,oh,nana,banana,banana, naanaa! Super cool vintage spot,they call you by name! The standard burger is to die for at the stand! The street corn is the bomb,go try this now!"}
{"text":"I really think this place should be more like 4 1/2 stars. Your horchata is delicious as  is the watermelon lemonade. I really enjoyed the burger and the beef taco but a few of the other tacos were only ok. The place was very small! Be warned don't take a massive group!"}
{"text":"This is the closest I've come to finding a burger similar to the greatest burger I've had in my entire life. Simple and delicious with out all the fancy toppings going on in the burger universe these days."}
{"text":"While I love the food here and eat here often, this has the be one of the most poorly run places. Why are 3 people helping me with my drive thru order? Everyone just seems confused every time I come in here."}
{"text":"went to this joint this week and I was very surprise to see first of all the a la carte price just for some simple burger nothing out of the ordinary 5.99 and then add french fries for 2.99 and then a drink x 2 total was 21.00 !!!!!!!!for 2 burger meals? no way, and then they forgot to place the 2nd order of fries so I just left it like that and stll was 21.00. could have went to Dennys for a whole meal for 21.00. and those are not fresh pattys no way, they are flat and look frozen. customer service is excellent. but the a la carte need to go."}
{"text":"Came here right before they closed and got the signature burgers. I didn't have high expectations so was honestly impressed. Everyone in my group seem to enjoy it too. It was a bit on the greasy side but maybe that's what made it taste good."}
{"text":"Great burger! I would say it's much like a In&Out burger. But local and just as delicious. French fries are always fresh and super yum and their shakes are as well. Tacos were okay. Stick with the burger and you won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"We love their burgers and sometimes get them bunless with a lettuce wrap instead. We have tried almost everything on their menu including the summer corn, milkshakes, tacos, and fries with stand sauce. It's fast food, but good food. They also have a drive through."}
{"text":"The best burger we've had in a long time. Meat is super tasty with the different kinds of meats used. Buttery, carmalized onions are a tasty addition. The 'fry sauce' is delicious ( never heard of before). The Dulce de Leche shake was super creamy and smooth. The Stand is definitely a new fave we will be visiting when we come up to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Burgers were very good. Cashier called me Pablo (not my name). Probably the best bacon I've ever had on a burger but not the most bacon I've ever had on a burger. Everything was delicious and if you're looking for a great burger you should totally go to The Stand."}
{"text":"Burger look like it was out of a magazine, mouthwatering. Fast service can't ask for much more"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, rude, condescending, unapologetic, long wait (not even the worst part). Isn't there another, better burger place 2 streets over and across the street?"}
{"text":"best burger I've ever had. I had to limit myself to 1 a week. delicious fries & the shakes are perfection. never had the tacos bc I can't deny myself a burger from there, ever!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this place out so we did . She ordered  the standard  burger with cheese double meat  it was very good she liked it I even liked it ..the fries on the other had were not as good"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but very similar to IN N OUT and honestly the milk shakes at in n out are better. The drive through is also pretty slow which is really annoying. The burger was good, but the milkshake was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Damn good burger. Nothing fancy but done very well. Only two food items on the menu: burger and fries so they have to be good if you're gonna stay in business. I can see why they were voted best burger in Phoenix by New Times. Brought the wife on m my second visit and she loved it too so this will be a regular stop when we want a good burger and fries. I wish In&Out would take a lesson in fries from them."}
{"text":"I drove from the east valley for their chocolate shake (and ate here twice in one week while i was working over here - something I never do). Awesomesauce! The shake isn't overly sweet and still has the occasional ice crystal. And the fries are some of the best I've ever had. I like the burger, but the others are the stars."}
{"text":"This place has good burgers, I was a little disappointed they didn't have the full menu at this location, only the burgers and fry but no tacos or roasted corn. The quality of the burger was great and the service was good overall. It would be nice if they offered a kids burger, kinda hard to pay full price for a kids burger that only has ketchup and a patty on it. Overall I recommend this place but maybe only for nights without the kiddos."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try with my husband. So I decided to look through Yelp for places bear by. The Stand came up and from the reviews I read it seemed decent. It also showed it was affordable. So hey why not try. We first pull up and the parking is chaos. No light whatsoever and barely any room to park. So we go in and the place looks cute. As we look at the menu they really don't have much options. We both ordered chicken tacos and an horchata water. As we go to our booth I notice something weird on the wall and roof. Come to find out they were flies!!!!! Lots of them. Disgusting dirty flies all over the wall and roof. My husband brings it to the attention to one of the employees and she says \"oh it's okay they don't go near the food.\" 20 min later we get our tacos and they are of decent size but for less than that I can get delicious AUTHENTIC Mexican tacos. Because being from Mexico City I can guarantee these are not authentic. The chicken taste like can food chicken. Oh and the water taste like milkshake not horchata!!!!! So in conclusion please save your time and money and go somewhere with actual Mexican tacos oh and that doesn't have flies. Yuck!"}
{"text":"OK, after several more trips the Stand has fully won me over. I think it may have been the salted dulce de leche shake. Or perhaps the french fries, or the chips and guacamole, or the fact that it is open till 11 PM -  and there isn't really a better place to get an inexpensive drive-thru meal of this quality."}
{"text":"The only reason why they are getting a 4 star is because the banana stand and dulce de leche shake are amazing but the food was just ok  The fries were to crispy and I like my fries crispy but not to the point where they are hard to eat. The burgers were ok, had good flavor but not worth the price and the tacos just weren't up to my standards the beef was ok and the chicken was dry. Overall this is a great place shakes but wouldn't come back for just the food just the shakes :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian fry bread recommend the red chili Indian fry bread taco. We will be back to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best chocolate shakes ever! Very friendly staff and great food ! I love supporting small businesses and this couple does it right!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I love the food. A lot of reviewers have said the burgers are dry and not flavorful, but I'd disagree. Everything from their burgers, fries, tacos, shakes, etc. are very good.  Their overall service, however, is what always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I have never been to a fast food joint with as slow of service as The Stand. Do not go, whether it's through the drive thru or the lobby, unless you have at least 20-30 minutes to spare. Even if you're the only one there you'll be waiting a good 15 minutes. I understand quality food takes longer than two minutes to make, but The Stand is outrageously long. Sometimes the food is worth the wait, but overall I wouldn't make it a place to frequent unless you're extremely patient."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to stop when I saw this old shack on the side of a road, but I'm so glad I did. The green Chile fry bread is incredible. The bread is made fresh right in front of you, it was the most delicious. Do not go by the look of this shack,  the food is authentic and the best!"}
{"text":"The menu is incredibly small, like three types of tacos small, but the tacos were filled with flavor. The set up was kind of weird--there's a drive through as well as walk in dining, and the same person was doing the drive thru orders and taking orders with walk in customers (it was pretty confusing and weird). However, staff was really friendly, prices were reasonable and service was fast."}
{"text":"In the past I would always have given The Stand 5 stars but a couple of things have changed and not for the better. They took tacos off the menu??! We always used to get a taco to share with our burgers and often would get chips n salsa which are now also gone. The staff told us the new location in Scottsdale would have tacos but we come here because it's local and won't be driving to Scottsdale to get tacos. The fries were so greasy today I had to wipe my fingers after each fry.   I hope The Stand returns to form as it really was great when it opened but after today's experience I wouldn't rush back as I have in the past."}
{"text":"The Stand is located in the building that used to be Maui Dog for those of us who remember it.  They splashed a new coat of paint on it and upgraded the drive thru.    I did the drive thru on a recent lunch break.  The speaker doesn't work well and the lady was laughing the entire time I was ordering.  Very odd.  Then she asked me my name and if it was cash or credit.  Even more odd.  The entire ordeal felt uncomfortable.  I just wanted to order some food and get back to work.  So 13 minutes and $8.46 later I received my fries and cheeseburger.  The fries were very tasty at first.  I thought they were cajun or seasoned.  They were salted just right and the oil tasted fresh.  After stopping to eat I realized they were slightly burnt and that was why I at first thought they were seasoned fries.  It wasn't bad at first but I realized there was no way I could eat them all and I started to get a burnt taste in my mouth.  The burger was a good size and tasty.  If In-and-Outs double cheese had a step brother it would be The Stand's burger.  Almost identical except the patty was slightly thicker.  It was juicy, cheesy, and executed nicely.  I would definitely order one again.  If not for the burnt fries and price tag this would easily be a 4 star burger spot.  While I appreciate the quality, almost 9 bucks for double cheese burger and fries is too much to become a regular rotation.  And please, it's a drive thru, no need to ask personal questions and payment options."}
{"text":"The first time we had this burger it was amazing. This visit was absolutely nasty. They must have changed their pattys. The fries were way greasy. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't bother...about $25 for two. Overpriced, overrated! Burger had no taste with a soggy bun. Limp fries too. In n' Out much better!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, amazing hamburgers. Perfect when I don't want to over think what to have for lunch."}
{"text":"Old school meets new school at the Shack! Classic burgers are flavorful due to a proprietary blend of short rib and beef, while the shakes get modernized with a great salted dulce de leche flavor that will knock your socks off. They also have tacos, also available with short rib, along with your choice of three fresh salsas!  The only things old school about this place are the design and service- dig the roadside signage and genuinely nice cashiers. Note that the \"regular\" cheeseburger is actually a double stack, so plan accordingly and bring your appetite, this will probably be the only meal you eat today."}
{"text":"Yum + drive thru! My favorite cheeseburger in Phoenix. Really cute place. Ice tea is good too."}
{"text":"Ok so this is my top burger place now. So delicious!!! I was hesitant to try their \"stand sauce\" but now I am addicted to it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb. I ordered a standard burger with bacon. DELICIOUS! The banana stand shake was phenomenally pleasing to the taste buds. You must try it!   My only suggestion: the French fries were flavorless and soggy. I also wish they had ranch. Lol"}
{"text":"Love this place but they need to get the window situation figured out. We waited for 25 min with one car in front of us. She handed me my shake it was all liquid and burgers were cold. When you are paying a premium for a burger you expect a good product."}
{"text":"2 bacon burgers, 1 fry, 1 small soda.  Almost $25.  Bacon was thick but very hard.  Not a bad fast food burger, and fries pretty good but soooo not worth the price.  Burger seemed on par with smashburger or five guys I dont mind paying for quality but pretty disappointed in pricing.  Lots of burger options out there.  Wish I could go back in time and drive on past.  Wanted to try a shake but didn't want to spend another $6.  Food gets a 3 rating.  Seating area is small and uncomfortable if eating there.  Sorry Stand.  I felt ripped off."}
{"text":"My husband swears by this place. He would (and attempted to) eat here every single day. We haven't tried the tacos yet but a note on the milkshakes - stick to the vanilla. Oh, and always get the stand sauce for your fries."}
{"text":"Just had a burger from them... Near closing time & yet they made the yummiest take-out burger we had in a longgg time! There was no time or pic for the review... Their short menu (with a one burger option!) is plenty!!! So glad i went there!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I am pleased to say it was really good. I ordered the a veggie taco and a chicken one as well, the veggie was my fav. I will be back, next time with my hubs. Ohh! As far as the wait time in the drive thru, yes is took a while but you can't rush good food. Yum"}
{"text":"Looks like \"the Stand\" downsized their tacos in a big way. The wedge of lime is almost as big as the tacos itself and then we have the inside of the beef taco which hardly contained any short rib at all. The tacos were good, but not worth $3.00 each, maybe for two, but they have to make a profit somewhere. Look at the other photos and then my tacos - hardly any meat and it took 12 minutes to make two of them when it was only mildly busy. The veggie taco was decent as well, but put some more veggies in there please. Salsa was fresh and full of good ingredients and corn tortillas also seemed freshly prepared. I suppose this could be considered a light lunch, but you will have to add chips or another side for a meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local burger shops! The burgers are great! The stand sauce makes them exceptional! It's also a great dipping sauce for the fries. Not really a fan of their tacos but the burgers make up for it! The shakes are really delicious and flavorful as well. The service has always been great! The people working there are really friendly and my food has always come out speedy! I've gotten quite a few friends to become stand \"regulars\" since I've brought them here!"}
{"text":"Everything about The Stand is delicious. Everything.   Everything at The Stand is fresh...right down to the homemade lemonade.   The staff? Friendly, helpful, and welcoming.   I usually get The Standard with cheese (Two house-ground patties, fresh lettuce, tomato, onion and lettuce). Once in a while, I'll add Niman Ranch bacon to the mix.  The burgers are consistently delicious...every single time.  Yesterday, I tried the short rib tacos, only because it's so hot outside, and I didn't want a heavy meal. They were TO-DIE-FOR delish! BIG hunks of tender, perfectly seasoned short rib meat, and fresh onion, cilantro, pickled cabbage and cojita cheese. They were FABULOUS!!!   This place is small, and usually a little crowded, but don't let that deter you. It's definitely THE place to go for wonderful burgers, freshly made fries and the best tacos I've ever had...  My only suggestion? A single burger for the smaller appetite..."}
{"text":"Awesome joint. Tasty food. However. There is one warning I have to give and kinda why I only did 4 stars... the jalapeños are HOT!  Now I like spicy, I like a kick, this straight up ruined my burger. My whole face was on fire. It ended up to be a little costly but we did have 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 tacos and a small and large horchata. $37.  If you're looking for a tasty burger that's against the norm. Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"Great local place. I love the shakes (too much)! A great alternative for in n out  if you want to support local biz or want to stay in the Arcadia central area. The drive thru is always fast and the staff is always friendly.  My only gripe is the ac is always FREEZING which deters me from ever wanting to eat inside."}
{"text":"The Stand is a Phoenix, AZ exclusive burger joint that would be so successful if it expanded into such places as San Diego.  Having focused our culinary exploration to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food restaurants in Phoenix, for our last stop, we decided to try one of the local foodie joints that have not appeared on these shows.  After our positive culinary experience there, this place should be featured on one of these shows.  Think In n Out's simplicity and yummy burgers and fries and that's what you get at the stand.  As you enter the restaurant, you immediately notice the basic menu of hamburgers, tacos, various side items, and shakes.  Love a place that doesn't make the ordering process complicated.  By simplifying the choices, the focus is more on the food and once you experience the food The Stand prides itself on, you'll be a believer too.  There is indoor seating and outdoor seating, but with the blistering heat, sitting inside was a must.  There just isn't enough indoor seats to my liking.  The decor is simple as it's food choices.  There's a large Coca-Cola poster art piece, a decorative clock, and an old Coca-Cola cooler next to the registers.  The customer service by its employees are stellar.  The Stand is a burger place that also sells a few Mexican food selections.  If there are two things that you must order, order the Standard cheeseburger along with the extra priced grilled onions and jalapeños and the short rib taco.  The Standard cheeseburger is comprised of 2 house ground beef patties, lettuce, tomato, dill pickle, stand sauce, and with the added butter caramelized onions and grilled jalapeños, you'll want to order another one.  All of the ingredients meshed well together to make your taste buds happy.  The short rib taco is composed of braised short rib, pickled red cabbage, cotija y queso fresco, diced onion, and fresh cilantro.  Once again, you'll want to order another one.  The taco comes with hot sauce that isn't too spicy, but complements the taco really well.  We also ordered tortilla chips and fresh tasting guacamole, Mexican street corn, one of the best horchata drinks, and salted dulce de leche hand-spun shake.  The chips and guacamole is a good appetizer, my wife really enjoyed the corn, and the shake was thick, delicious goodness.  I asked one of the employees, who just so happened to formerly live in San Diego close to where we live, if the owners were planning to expand.  She said that she's been trying to convince the owners to open one in San Diego because this would flourish there.  We coincidently agreed that The Stand would be a great addition to what Pacific Beach has to offer.  I'm taking a stand to have The Stand open in San Diego or at least somewhere close so that I could satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"Delicious fries, burgers and chicken tacos! Price was nice too. Love the outdoor patio. We will return :)"}
{"text":"I am in town thru tomorrow! I sure recommend this place!  Awesome burger and fries... I haven't tried the tacos but I am sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The burgers and shakes are good, but when I asked what the Chocolate Chile shake was, she didn't mention that they put Chile powder in it, yuck, don't have this shake, it's awful. If she would have told me that they put Chile powder in it I would have gotten the Salted Dulce De Leche instead."}
{"text":"First visit to The Stand tonight. We went through the drive through.  The burgers were good all things considered, but overpriced. Same burger is less expensive (by a lot) at The Habit.  The fries were awful - barley warm, I got the impression they were left over - definitely not a fresh batch. If they would have been fresh, they may have been good. We also ordered two shakes- one chocolate, one vanilla. Again, the shakes were good - nothing incredibly special, but good yet overpriced. Can't say we will return as there are too many equally as good burger joints that are not so expensive."}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars if I could!!  64 minutes in the drive through line!!!  When we got to the window and told the girl she said \"oh you should have came in we didn't have a line inside at all\".  Does she realize how stupid that was, you are a fast food place with a drive through, basically you all don't know how to manage your business and the flow of your customers!!  We won't be back"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Burger had great flavor, moist, and the way the cheese was totally melted into the patties reminded me of in-n-out, except way better.   BANANA MILKSHAKE. Had big chunks of real banana in there and I loved the fat straw they give you.   The fries were absolute perfection. Small and very crispy, like a whole boat full of the yummy pieces you find in the bottom of your bag when you get fast food.   Service was very friendly. When you dine in they stop by to see how everything tastes and to clear your trays and trash for you which I thought was a very nice touch. I will definitely be coming back here again, if not only to try out the Dulce De Leche salted caramel shake. YUM."}
{"text":"Cool place. Good burgers and shakes. Simple menu. However, pretty over-priced. A burger, fries and a shake cost me $18. The quality is good, but not that much better than in-n-out for the money."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out The Stand, which has been on my to-try list for awhile. Ordered The Standard cheeseburger with bacon and jalapenos, and a side of the hand cut fries. Also, tried to order a milkshake, but unfortunately the machine was down.  I really enjoyed the burger and fries. I liked the homemade Stand sauce. It's your typical special sauce, but had a hint of spice to it. Went well with the burger and fries. Good experience overall. Hopefully, I can grab a shake next time."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 time now.  The building has a lot of turn over before becoming \"The Stand\".  The new owners did a great job of working with what they had to make the building inviting (paint, planters, etc) to customers to get over the stigmatism of a dive joint.    The burgers and tacos are premium grade!  One of the best burgers in central phoenix.  The fries are also good.  One of my favorites is the Salted Malts.  It will set you back nearly $5, but it's worth it.  One added perk, they serve their malts with a wide straw!  Few things are more frustrating that having to suck a malt thru a narrow soda straw.  I shouldn't have to turn red in the face just to enjoy a malt.     Most of the seating is outside.  It's shaded, but I'm guessing that it will be less desirable during Arizona's summer's months.  The service is also very good.  They do have modern kiosk cash register systems that are quick and convenient.  Definelty a must try if you're a Arcadia/Central Phoenix local."}
{"text":"I love it, my wife loves it and so do our kids.  The inside is a little small so you may have a wait at lunch or early evening but there is also a small patio in the front that is perfect when it's not summertime.  While the burger is pretty good, the tacos are great.  The staff and owners are also very friendly and the service is fast and good."}
{"text":"I'm definitely giving a 5 star review due to the service.   We had our 1 cheat day and I was dead set on a greasy burger. So, we decided to try The Stand and get drive thru.   However, when we got home, the bag broke open, spilling all of the food on the concrete parking spot. We were so bummed! I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Ron. This is where I'm floored.   Ron drove all the way to where we live just to deliver a new set of burgers!! Are you kidding?!? That is AMAZING customer service and REALLY going above and beyond!!!!  Thank you so much for turning our night around!!   Oh! And you really have to try these shakes. Wow."}
{"text":"Good food and a cool place. I got a cheeseburger with grilled jalapenos and fries. They have a drive-through and the staff was very friendly. My only complaint was that it was a little greasy but still very good. Price wasn't too bad similar to five guys."}
{"text":"Used to love getting veggie tacos and street corn with a shake here. Please bring back the tacos or add something for vegetarians. A portobello burger? You have lost a long time, loyal customer."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy! Not your average drive through. The fries are so good with a delicious pepper and stand sauce on the side: the burger is well seasoned and great!! Definitely go!"}
{"text":"I ordered the classic burger with only one patty (it comes with two) with the works and cheese of course! I can describe the burger in one word, perfect! The horchata is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger with the family or alone.  The Good:  Easy to find, good parking.  Inside is clean and cute.  Lots of staff there to help with anything you need.  It's one of those classic, limited menus that stood the test of time.    The food has a really nice presentation to it.  See my pic and others.  Everything looks fresh and the burger is carefully wrapped.  Lot's of attention to detail.  There is a SNAP when you bite through the fresh veggies.  The taco is a nice change, try it once.  A burger, taco, and large drink is $11 and change.  The bad:  Well, unfortunately, I just didn't like the taste of the burger that much.  It's not bad by any means, just not on my tops list.  The combination of spices just didn't hit me the right way, and I didn't get as much veggie taste as I would have liked.  The bun was dry, cracking up a little as I got more into the burger.  That being said, it's still a nice place.  Everyone else seems to like it so maybe it's just my palette.  Everything else about the place is good so I have no problem recommending it."}
{"text":"This review only speaks to the amazing milkshakes they serve at The Stand. So delicious and a really cute spot. Nice employees and a drive-thru to boot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger. Burger was great. \"Jamaica\" drink was a great hibiscus lemonade. Fries are like \"oven\" fries, not for me. Great little enclosed patio barely feels like you're right off Indian school"}
{"text":"5 stars for the salted dulce de leche shake here. Probably one of the many reasons I will never see a six pack on my body, but I'm okay with that. Seriously, the sweet and salty combo of this shake soothes my soul.   The burgers not bad either. Although I wouldn't be upset if an in n out were to move into Arcadia."}
{"text":"First time! These burgers are awesome! It's almost a shame to call them fast food. They offer gluten-free buns as well. They make their burgers fresh every day...that's fast food to brag about.  The chili chocolate shake is amazing.   The young staff is friendly and helpful. Breath of fresh air   I highly recommend this joint if you need something fast but good. This place is family owned. Buy local! Put your money back into your community."}
{"text":"Their burger is very traditional. I wouldn't say that there is anything special about the burger but it's not a bad burger. I added bacon for 1.95 extra and my burger turned out great. The patty was nice and soft, just well marinated, not too salty and everything was good and basic. The fries was free that day so that a plus! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would normally be wary of any place that mixes burgers and Mexican.  I just had the great good fortune of being given a double cheese burger, fries, and a shake.  The shake tasted like dark chocolate frozen pudding. And yes, that's a good thing.  The burger reminded me of In and Out, only not as greasy.  The fries dipped in the chipotle aioli were pretty great.  Next to Smashburger in Del Mar, this place is a favorite."}
{"text":"Maybe the best burgers in central Phoenix? Super simple menu, not fancy at all, great place for lunch.   *The milkshakes are out of this world*"}
{"text":"YUM! I literally crave this place every week. The food is fresh, tasty, and amazing. I've loved everything on the menu that I've tried, and the staff is always friendly. We are using them to cater a party with their food truck, and I'm so excited!"}
{"text":"So after seeing all the positive near 700 reviews, that it had an avg of 4 stars and living in the area l  was very excited to try this place. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed. The cheeseburger was average, nothing that really makes it stand apart from anywhere else with a drive thru. Especially not for 7$. And the tacos! :( I mean they were good but at 2-3 bites not worth 3$. They were just so small. I wish I liked this place because the concept of burgers and tacos is great for indecisive people like me. However, with a small, pricey menu and average taste I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"They use very fresh ingredients and the frys were fresh cut...but the burger was plain with no flavor...nothing to differentiate it from other burger joints!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time with the family in tow.  As we walked in we were promptly greeted.  I placed our order which consisted of 5 cheese burgers, 2 French fries with special sauce, 3 Mexican Cokes, & 4 chocolate shakes.  Our bill was approximately $61.  Our order was delivered to our table and everyone was impressed. The food was excellent!  As we walked out my daughters asked when we could return.  Can't wait to return & try the short rib tacos."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty basic but has good favors. They are served on double patties. My favorite was the ducle de leche shakes must try !! Busy place both inside and drive thru"}
{"text":"Best burger place I've found thus far. I have celiac disease, so I always get the gluten free bun and their fries are gluten free as well. Accommodating of allergies as long as you communicate to them. The stand sauce is so good, blows the In N Out special sauce out of the water. Great service too, a lot of younger employees but we always get exceptional customer service. It is a great but dangerous thing that this place is around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"Super delicious food! The burger was tasty, the chicken int the taco cooked to perfection. And the salted dulce de leche was the best!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday. Ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions, and some fries. The food came out very quickly and the staff was very polite.  A solid experience all around."}
{"text":"Update: their fries have improved, yummy seasoning and actually crispy. Also, they have one of the best salted caramel shakes in town!"}
{"text":"When the craving hits for a hearty burger, terrific fries, and a rich and thick milk shake, this is where I go. The place has the comfortable look and feel of an old-fashioned mom 'n pop burger stand, with friendly service to complement the tasty fare. A big plus for me: gluten-free buns are available!"}
{"text":"I have to update to add the extra star for the great customer service I had at the most recent trip to The Stand.  We were greeted with enthusiasm and excitement, personable and friendly... Top notch for staff!  The food was de-lish and fantastic as usual.  I had the chocolate milkshake...seriously, AMAZING.  They've also worked on their speediness for to-go orders! I'll definitely be thinking of this place when i want a quick, higher-quality-than-Wendy's burgers!"}
{"text":"I actually came here because I had purchased a Deal Chicken deal. So glad I did!! The burgers were to die for! The Banana Stand milkshake was tasty and perfect! Peach Lemonade was delish! And the fries...Well they were okay, the boyfriend didn't like that there were so many little pieces versus full fries. And I thought they were a touch to salty, but I would gladly order them again! Everyone was really happy to see us, and serve us! The place is sort of small, but it has a patio with a cooling unit on it. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a win! I am so happy that this tiny, easy to miss burger/taco joint turned out to have such fantastic food/ambiance! You know it was good because after we devoured (literally) our burgers and fries, we stood back in line for a dulce de leche shake (after hearing someone else on the patio exclaim to his fellow diner - \"This is the best shake I have ever had!!!\" - so we knew we had to get one). It did not disappoint. They were even giving out samples of their banana shake, which was equally delicious. I am definitely going to be coming back because the service was attentive, the food came out quickly (despite the power apparently going out half an hour before we got there), and both the indoor & outdoor spaces were hip, cute & clean. In my opinion, the burgers here are better than In N Out or Five Guys. The Stand....I love you!"}
{"text":"BEST DAM BURGERS EVER !!! And that house sauce and butter grilled onions are awesome. Fries were a little to crunchy for my taste but nonetheless really good."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Great atmosphere. Friendly and warm feel from the staff. The menu is simple And it appears they give all their got to their specialty items, which is everything on the menu. I ordered the burger. It was pretty tasty! I would like to come back and try the tacos sometime. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the presentation is great. The only problem that I saw with this place was that it took them 30+ minutes to get my meal out to me. A friend that was there with me got their meal within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering but was waiting for me to get my meal before we headed back to work to enjoy our meals. The log wait time should have yielded a gourmet meal but instead gave me a meal that was tasty but resembled nothing like a gourmet lunch. I most likely will never go here again although I did some shakes leaving out the door and they sure did look like something I would have wanted on the next visit. But I will find a place that doesn't leave me waiting 30+ minutes for the same food."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a burger with friends last Saturday and it was delicious! Beware though, their \"regular\" cheeseburger actually has two patties! I'm glad that I asked because I only wanted 1! I probably could've eaten two but this gal really only NEEDS one. ;) The burger itself had so much flavor and I loved all of the toppings, including their special sauce! My only complaint was the bun. It was a little dry and not anything special. In fact, I may order it wrapped in lettuce next time and forget the bun altogether.   THEIR FRIES. Holy heaven, you must get these! They are hand cut and have the most delicious seasoning on them. I could literally eat these every single day and be the happiest camper.   Since it is right around the corner from our house, I'm sure i'll be back!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple and easy. Burgers and tacos are fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive and they provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Well, I can finally say that I have tried the burgers. Pretty legit. I can see how they could be compared to In-n-Out, but they do not taste the same to me. Similar textures going on, but very different patties. Am I really dissecting the finer points of a hamburger right now? I need to just stop, drop, and eat a salad before things get out of control."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw on the Local News that this place was voted Best Burgers in America. I beg to differ, they were good but not the Best. I still think Five Guys is a great contender. The place just looks like a little wooden Shack. We arrived 30 minutes before they closed and the cars were wrapped around the Drive Thru. We just ordered The Stand Burger with Cheese which is your usual Lettuce,Tomatoe,Mayo,Onions on a Kaiser Roll. The Burgers were meaty and big, their French Fries were Shoestring and good. They sell Tacos and  Milkshakes too. They have a newer location with an extended menu. I might try them too."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!! Seriously, been to five guys, deluxe burgers etc.   This place kills it"}
{"text":"Talk about amazing... I can't say enough good about The Stand. I've been here several times, and the staff is always so bright, happy, and passionate about their food. My favorite thing is the Mexican Corn... I have an obsession with it. It's perfect in every way with the onions, cilantro, cheese, mayo, lime deliciousness! My only wish is that it wasn't seasonal. ;) Everything is made fresh, which does mean a wait sometimes, especially when it's busy... but I tell you, you won't be disappointed if you've got the time! I also recommend the banana shake, and this coming from someone who hates bananas... It's delicious, creamy, and entirely refreshing! Burgers are flavorful and delicious... Fries delicious and also flavorful... The best horchata I've had in town, perfect balance of sugar and cinnamon. YUM!... Next on my list is the salted dulce de leche shake.  Oh, and GET THE STAND SAUCE!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   I'm always looking for a good burger and I don't have to look any further! I've passed this place several times and always wondered how good their food is.   So what did I do? I Yelped it and found out it had some pretty great reviews.   I went with my sister on Saturday. We pulled in to the parking lot and already it was getting pretty busy for just opening (11am). We walked in and it was pretty small, but hey, these kinds of places usually are.   The menu is pretty limited when it comes to their burger. They have \"The Standard\". But when you make something right, why deviate from it? I got mine with jalapenos and we ordered some fries.   It was busy, so the wait was a little longer than we expected but it was definitely worth it.   The burger and fries are so fresh, hot and good! If I could just make one minor suggestion, it would be to toast the bun on the grill a little bit. I  Needless to say, I felt like a huge fatty after I left. I'd definitely come back again. I saw a woman eating some tacos. Maybe I'll try those next!"}
{"text":"So here is the ugly: the wait time to get a burger is ridiculously long given the fact that the only item on the menu is a burger! You can go to a full service restaurant and get your food faster. I observed the operation and it looked like they focus most of their effort on the drive thru as the orders there were flying left and right!  The good: once the food arrived it was good. Solid burger with very well seasoned fries.  I have to give them a 3 star rating because of the wait time and the inability to get the orders right in the dining room."}
{"text":"Summary:  Clearly, The Stand is competing against In-N-Out.  For a few bucks more, The Stand gives you a significantly higher level of product from a slightly broader menu, and sold by a local business.  It reigns supreme in the hybrid restaurant category somewhere between In-N-Out and Delux.  Round 1:  The standard ($5.50) vs. the double-double ($4ish).  NOTE:  All prices are from memory since neither website publishes prices.  Although the burgers share a physical appearance (two cheesy patties, wrapped in paper, fun/sloppy presentation), The Standard burger feels, looks and tastes less like a chain burger and more like something that someone made just for me.   Big plus.  Except for the bun, every ingredient is superior to In-N-Out.  Thicker burger with more beefy flavor due to their meat mix, crisper thicker, fresher lettuce, excellent amount of sauce (I find INO to be too saucy in order to cover for the more bland burger), fresh onions (INO uses stale onions that give you stank breath-- hence people's preference for the \"grilled\" onions).   The only drawback is The Standard's spongy firm bun, which helps with holding the sandwich together but lacks the texture and flavor that a pillowy soft potato bun gives INO burgers.  Verdict:  The Standard.  Not really close.  Round 2:  Stand fries ($3) vs. INO fries ($2ish)  Fries has always been INO's biggest weakness. They are slim, hot, and often crisp, but they have absolutely zero flavor and usually come without any salt on them.  I HATE having to add salt to my fries.  Dumb salt packets.  The Stand's fries rock, some of the best I've had at a burger joint, even better than Delux when considering they cost $2 less.  A good sized portion comes fairly crisp, and best of all, they are very well-seasoned.   Verdict:  Stand fries, in the blink of an eye.  Round 3:  The Stand's chocolate banana shake ($4.50) vs. INO's chocolate shake ($2.50).  I think INO gets way too much credit for its shakes.  They're too thick to pull through a straw, and they are just pure soft serve.  The Stand takes actual ice cream, actual milk and, for the banana shake, actual banana and banana extract, to make their shakes.  The difference is obvious from the first sip.   Plus, The Stand has more than the boring vanilla, chocolate, strawberry options.  Verdict:  You had me at chocolate banana.  For the record, the tacos at the Stand could use some work.  I like the idea of tacos as a burger alternative, and the tacos are large, made with fresh ingredients including pickled onions (more of those, please) and above par tortillas.  But the chicken and short ribs didn't have a lot of seasoning-- they just relied on the taste of the well prepared but under seasoned meat.  If I wanted to \"honor\" the ingredient, I'd go somewhere fancy.  For a taco, give me some kick.  No kick found, not even in the spicy salsa.  My service was excellent (I got comped an order of fries just 'cuz).  The store was very clean and was well remodeled.  The inside seating didn't seem like it would work for a highchair, but the patio probably would.  The drive thru is a nice idea, but only if you called ahead and no one was in front of you.  My order took 6 minutes from when I placed it at the counter."}
{"text":"This place is pricey for a burger joint, but they make a quality burger and thick cut seasoned fries. Do yourself a favor and order one of their milkshakes. I've gone there for nothing but a milkshake on more than one occasion. The chocolate milkshake was amazing, but the chocolate chili milkshake was horrible. I think they mix powder into it, but it clumped instead of blending in. Each sip had hard clumps of spice...couldn't drink it. I ordered it to go so I couldn't even ask for a replacement."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Food came out fairly quickly. It was a bit pricey for what it was...burgers. Id gobthere again if I were in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Burgers are nice and juicy...Fries are nice and crispy...Mexican corn needed more condiments but was good...overall GREAT experience!"}
{"text":"A cool little burger joint tucked away in the Arcadia neighbourhood on Indian School. A definite step above fast food, though not quite as good as some of the gourmet burgers served on Camelback in the same area, like Delux. What looks like a little tin shed outside is an old-school diner on the inside with about 10 tables; also has a drive-thru. Most of the seating is on the covered veranda, with only 2 tables inside, so I imagine dining in during the summer when it is busy can become an issue. The menu is extremely simple - 1 kind of Hamburger, called \"The Standard\", 3 kinds of tacos (veggie, short rib, chicken), side of fries or chips & salsa, and milkshakes. That's it. Makes it easy. The Standard is nice tight little burger that doesn't disappoint. The taste and texture reminded me of an In N Out burger - so if you love those, The Standard is right up your alley. Nothing that special about it, but it's done right, has a solid but soft bun, and the meat has its own unique flavour when mixed with their special sauce. For $5.69 its not the cheapest burger around, but it's definitely worth more than your average dollar menu cheapo burger. The short rib taco is pretty good also - nice flavourful meat. My one complaint might be that there is too much topping of cabbage and salsa etc...I'd rather just savour more of that meat and not let the corn tortilla get too soggy. The service at the counter was rather unremarkable but they were competent, so no complaints.  So that's about it - I can't go back to try more of the menu, because there is nothing else to try. But if I am in the area and craving a quick burger as opposed to one of the Camelback Burger-row restaurants, I'd probably go to The Stand again."}
{"text":"Burgers and tacos. It's not rocket science. I can make both of those at home and come out with pretty good results because I choose all the ingredients. Fresh ground beef for the burgers and nicely seasoned shredded chicken for the tacos. This is the reason I don't buy burgers from a restaurant if I am eating them at my home. But what if I have a hankering for a tasty burger while at work? The Stand is the correct answer.  So it's another burger joint, but with some tacos, right? Sort of. It's small and cozy with some indoor and some covered outdoor seating. The staff are cheery and helpful. The menu is simple and easy to order from. I typically go with The Standard with cheese and fries with a side of Stand Sauce. The Stand Sauce isn't a terribly complex sauce but that is sort of the beauty of it. It compliments the fries perfectly.  The burgers and fries come out hot and very fresh. You can tell the quality of the meat in the burger from the first bite. The fries are equally telling of the quality. A little bit of Stand Sauce with the fries and you have yourself a home run of a burger lunch. It is a hearty burger but not too large as to create a coma once you are back at your desk. The serving of fries is equally portioned just right.   I hope you have read this far because this is the important stuff right here. Get the lemonade. Don't hesitate. It is strong but balanced. I have had the peach and strawberry which both were extremely tasty. I had to water them down a little bit but I like that they serve it with a good strong profile so that you can water it down if you like because the other way around simply wouldn't work. I believe there is a daily rotation on which type of lemonade they are serving. I have never been let down by it.  This is Phoenix so I recommend getting there as close to or a little before 1100 so that you don't have to sit outside in the summer. In the winter the outdoor seating is wonderful, however. It also helps quite a bit to be toward the front of the line so I can get back to my desk in time with a little lemonade to spare."}
{"text":"Decided to check out The Stand to satisfy a burger craving. I appreciate how small and simple the menu is - do a few things, and do them well! I ordered a burger, Mexican Street Corn (I guess they figure we don't know what \"elote\" is), and a short rib taco.  Apparently, the elote is on backorder. The gal who appeared to be in charge told me the vendor didn't have any, but they should be getting some in Monday. I can only hope she just meant fresh corn and they really prepare the elote fresh there. It's simple enough - no reason to order it in pre-made and just heat it. I decided to order fries instead. The place is super clean, and all of the staff is friendly and seem happy to be there.  When receiving my order, I noticed the burger was falling out the bottom of the bag. Not only were they quick to apologize and give me a new (double) bag - they added in a second order of fries since it seems I lost some to the first bag. While I appreciate the customer service there, and felt they were really on point - the last thing I need is a second order of fries. Had I been paying more attention, I would have thanked them but refused. The short rib taco is well executed, but about $1.00 too high. I am spoiled by plenty of close and solid taco options - for $3.00, a tiny street taco better be a revelation. It was good - but certainly not amazing. Beef, cilantro, pickled onion and cotija. Tasty, but not a great value. The fries are quite good - but not fantastic. And the burger was meh. Nothing wrong with it. The patties were seasoned, bun and veggies fresh - but nothing stellar or phenomenal about it. I'd put the quality up there with 5 Guys and Habit - and of the three, will support the small, local one. So yes, I am sure I will be back - there was nothing wrong with it and the staff are a treat to deal with. I just wasn't \"wowed.\""}
{"text":"This place has some of the tastiest food in town for a great price. I was very disappointed to find out they don't have their tacos here anymore! Those things are what made me love this place initially. 4 stars because they are depriving me of their delectable tacos"}
{"text":"I love this place! Neighborhood hotspot that doesn't seem to fail. The burgers are delicious and the short rib tacos are my favorite. They also have a gluten free bun that's so good!  One of my favorite places in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"A burger stand & a taco stand.  Allow me to stand and applaud.  Okay sorry that was cheesy (no pun intended), but seriously I'm over the moon for this place.  I feel like this place follows the Apple model Steve Jobs preached for so many years.  Elegant simplicity.  The Stand is indeed a simple place with a simple menu but with elegant quality to their food.  Maybe you think I'm overstating things, but truthfully I just love when restaurants focus on doing the simplest of things well.  Oftentimes those that try to be great at everything aren't good at anything.  The Stand knows what they're good at, and they execute beautifully.  I came here Friday after work for an early dinner with a craving for three specific things.  A tasty burger, a tasty taco, and a milkshake (not necessarily in that order).  The Stand has a drive thru, but I decided to dine in this time around.  The inside is a small setup with a few booths and a couple of high tables that can fit maybe 12 people total.  The covered outside patio can seat about double that, but with a name like The Stand you'd probably expect a smallish size place.  Like I said, the menu is simple.  There's one burger option (with a few possible customizations), three taco options, as well as a few side options.  The drink options are much more abundant in variety ranging from lemonades to sodas to milkshakes.  For my visit today it was as follows.  A standard burger with cheese, a chicken taco, and their famous dulce de leche milkshake.  Total cost including tip was $15.  Let's start with the burger.  A mixture of chuck, brisket, and short rib (yup, short rib).  Fresh ground and made to order with onions, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce and their own housemade sauce.  This was glorious.  The burger is actually two patties so plenty of meat in each bite.  Meat was cooked perfectly and insanely juicy.  Heck even the toppings were great with each being cold and crisp like they'd just been cut on the spot.  I'd say this makes my burger top 5 here in the valley.  Next, the chicken taco.  Corn tortilla, roasted chicken, cotija cheese, queso fresco, pickled red onion and cilantro.  Good clean flavors with a little heat from the chicken and a mellowing from the cheeses.  The tortilla held up perfectly and didn't break apart after biting into it and had a pleasant texture.  Lastly, the shake.  Made with sea salt, Mexican caramel, and vanilla ice cream.  This is The Stand's calling card and I can see why.  That perfect mix of the sweet and the salty with savoriness of the caramel to boot.  A delicious, smooth, satisfying cap to the meal.  Its so simple, yet so awesome.  A proud Arcadia neighborhood joint that delivers on exactly what they advertise.  A small but mighty restaurant with fantastic food.  I now understand why so many stand up for the freestanding wonder that is The Stand **ducks tomato**."}
{"text":"Chick fil a claims they have the fastest drive thru in Arizona. The Stand can claim they have the slowest. Holy cow, I think that's what they had to kill in the back in order to give me my burger. Will the owner of the stand please go take a drive thru an in an out and see how they manage to cook and deliver a burger in under 5 minutes. Even 10 minutes would be an improvement. Or just close the drive thru and leave it to brighter minds to not waste peoples time."}
{"text":"Let me explain to you people who think you know what good food is....first off think about all the really great food you have had. And if you know such good food and are such an expert then why don't you have your own restaurant? ??  All you foodies out there could not even be a busboy never mind a dishwasher in a restaurant of any quality....your mom worked harder than you ever did and made really good food....because she had one thing on her mind while preparing your breakfast lunch or dinner....YOU ...your health and all the LOVE in the universe is why our moms cooked us such fine and tasty meals....the main chef at the stand is number one CLEAN...and we'll groomed the back lot and trash area are also clean Before I eat anything outside of my own kitchen I look at the facility the staffs hygiene and then if the back alley passes the test then we can go to step #2. So we can now take into consideration of any friends who may or may not have made a recommendation  Most of these people especially people in the biz are  Not even aware of real food.....so back to the STAND.... ITS like the Beatles stated while looking for a good meal in Lanka shire bedstye...\"love is all u need\" and the STAND HAS LOVE....BUT more to come"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a really good burger a few weekends ago and I remembered The Stand. My friend Jason was just there raving about it, and I remember John Jay from John Jay and Rich coming here almost every other day so I knew I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Its pretty simple. Order your meat, add cheese, add toppings, add fries and a shake or soda if you would like. There are few options and that means they can focus on quality. I added bacon and roasted jalapeno peppers.  Be warned my friends... these jalapeno's were NO JOKE! I pulled a few off because I was starting to sweat. The meat itself was delicious and juicy, the cheese was ooy-gooy and plenty, the bacon was thick, and the fries were crispy. My -1 star was for all around service. So bad. I think they were stoned out of their minds and it was slow so at least they weren't busy but I cant tell you how uncomfortable I felt and how many times I had to slowly repeat myself. No smile, no common courtesies, no direction. They had one of their friends sitting in a corner who they were paying far more attention to even as they took our order. It was just an odd experience. Made me regret not taking the drive through. I am also sad I didn't get the chance to try the tacos before they pulled them from the menu but oh well that burger was great!"}
{"text":"I'm a loyal, happy customer. If I could give a 4.5 I would do that. The food is great. The service is hit and miss, but for the most part pretty good. I work down the street and frequently grab food from the drive thru. The last lady at the drive thru seemed a little out of it, maybe she was new, or the AZ heat was getting to her (and it would be helpful to give napkins out at the drive-thru please!) Tacos are delicious, only a couple bucks, and pretty filling! Get the short rib tacos- my fav! The Standard burger always tastes fresh. They gladly make it by less as well, but the buns are pretty tasty. If you go in the evening or lunch time, when they are really busy don't expect to get out of there very quickly. I went after work to pick up food to go for my family and it took about 30-45 minutes for the food to come out. They could definitely use more space."}
{"text":"Drove to the Phoenix location all the way from Surprise, AZ.  Parking not that great, but still manageable. The place is small the menu very limited . We ordered a double cheeseburger and a single bacon cheeseburger with all the toppings. We also placed an order of fries. The size is good for two if you are not a French fry  eater. They are identical to InN Out's . And two soft drinks.  The Burger's were delicious hot and mouth watering. The fries though they look like In N Out 's. They are much better and crunchy. Regretted getting just one order. Definitely recommend this place and we will be back for sure. The staff very friendly and courteous. Was informed by a staff member that they have another location in Scottsdale they serve taco's at that location. Good job folks keep it up."}
{"text":"Good *little* spot for tasty burgers and tacos.   I see lots of people checking in here all the time, and they've got a solid four star rating, of course I wanted to check the place out. Then deal chicken had a run on burgers apparently and were selling $20 to The Stand for just $10, so we bought it. I hate to waste a good deal, so we planned to visit for dinner one day, missed it and planned the next week, over and over. Finally, we landed here for lunch on a random Thursday.   Is it better than an In-N-Out? I don't know, but it was pretty close in taste, and bigger in size. Who doesn't like bigger? This IS America, right? Everything was fresh, tasty, and I left feeling like I'll be back at some point in the near (or distant) future - who knows.  We tried a couple of the ($3) short rib tacos, delish'. A ($5.50) burger with cheese, and we added ($.75) grilled jalapeños to it, also a great idea if you want to spice it up a bit. $2 will buy you an order of Mexican corn, a (half) ear of corn covered with chipotle mayo, cheese, and chili powder. A reasonable sampling of their menu, and over all it was a great (unhealthy) meal.  After ordering, we stood off to the side for a few minutes chatting while waiting for our order to be called, and waited, and waited some more. Before I even realized we weren't getting our order, the lady behind the counter asked me what we had ordered, I guess she noticed us standing there, and everyone else getting their orders filled. I probably would have gone another 5 minutes or so before realizing. Apparently the POS (point of sale)  ;-) forgot to print out the order for the kitchen. Great service, I thought. Thanks for noticing!  My only issue with The Stand is the extreme limited seating. During lunch, and I can only imagine I was not the only person annoyed with this, there was a consistent line of about 5 groups of people ordering food, with only 4 tables inside to sit. Probably not a big deal eight months of the year, but August is definitely not one of those eight wonderful Phoenix months. I am not about sitting outside on a patio during lunch, sweatin to the oldies, and then heading back to work, no thanks. Adding insult to injury, there was a rather large group of people chatting away who were set up at three of the four inside tables that had finished their meal 20 + minutes ago, ARGHGGHHG. That was not very considerate, considering the room full of people holding their trays of food fighting for a spot to eat. Finally, the fourth table cleared out and we were able to snatch it up.  I decided to sit on the same side of the booth as my wife, in case someone else wanted to sit on the other side; I guess no one was outgoing enough to randomly join, but at least I tried. We ate our food, with a bit of small talk, wiped our table and went on our way. There were still 6 or so people aimlessly wandering around for a seat, and the moment we stood up someone else grabbed the booth; all the while the one large group was still chatting away, drinking their soda's, taking up three tables.  I'm not sure how off putting something like this would be to diners, but I'd suggest trying out some friendly, non-threatening signage asking something like \"please consider diners waiting to enjoy this spot too\" to be put out during peak times; like lunch on a Thursday, and put away during other times. We enjoyed the food, enjoyed the service, but didn't enjoy getting cramped up into the little box of a dining room on a lunch break. I'm guessing this is a much better drive through spot than dine in.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Please, drive on through for your order. :-)"}
{"text":"The meat is a excellent, fries are crispy, stand sauce is delicious. All around I really enjoy the burger experience here at the stand.   The only reason I wouldn't rate this a five is because I had to spend $25 for two people when I feel it's not THAT much better than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Came in here expecting great things considering I was craving both a hamburger and a taco and couldn't make up my mind. I thought a cheeseburger and short rib taco sounded great, especially considering it came with my two fav ingredients: onion and cilantro. Well I was really hungry, drove into a very busy drive thru and decided to dine in. Only one problem: one girl was working the register for drive thru, naturally, and there was a guy both working as a runner and a cashier which meant I did not get service until 10-16 minutes later . I ordered what I wanted and thought it as nice that they offered free fries on Mondays. So I get my order, decide to find a seat outside and find that my leggings nearly ripped a hole when it got caught on a sharp end on one of the cheap aluminum chairs. Had there actually been a rip I would have been so angry. But only, just a pilled part that I need to scissor off. Also, my taco did not come with any cilantro like it said it would as well, although he food was good.Anyway, I wasn't all that impressed with my first experience. Not sure if it's worth coming back..."}
{"text":"Relished Every Bite  From the outside it looks like a cute renovated Burger stand from old burger drive-through's from the 80s in the 90s. The inside is small with about six tables ranging anywhere from a two seater to a six seater along with the patio on the outside. And on a busy night I could see this place getting very cramped inside.  I ordered the standard burger with fries in the Dulce de Leche Shake. The best way I can describe the burger would be like the good backyard burger with all the fixings of lettuce tomato with 1000 Island spread. The fries were excellent not too crispy and not too soggy with a tender center.  Some say that Dulce de Leche was stolen by Prometheus from the gods. After tasting this drink you will be unable to deny that it is something from the divine. My only complaint is that this drink was a tad too sweet for me but if you have a sweet tooth then this drink would be perfect for you."}
{"text":"The burger was really good. The fries were good but I wish they would have been thicker. The star was the caramel milkshake, I will be going back for another one."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes in the valley hands down! the burgers are pretty good but what makes The Stand different from other burger joints are the flavorful, delicious milkshakes. I would stay away from the tacos because they really didn't do it for me. Even after the bad tacos, I still stuck with this place and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has awesome burgers and fries, throw some stand sauce on top and it's even better! The service is great too - I was helped by a very nice girl at the window who went above and beyond for customer service. I haven't tried anything else, but if their tacos are as good as their burgers, I know I'll like them."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait a long time in the drive through....I waited more than 20 minutes and two cars in front of me decided to go inside instead of waiting.  You cannot call your order in and pick it up.  If you could, that might eliminate quite a bit of the wait.  The burger was adequate and the fries very good but mine were not crispy at all.  The burger could have used a little more salt and a little more sauce and it would have been even better.  It was a fair amount for a fair price and it was hot and fresh.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Double patties with some cheeze Would you like some fries with that? Yes pleaze Guilt free, Gluten Free Taste like In-N-Out, I'd have to agree Got me on a weekly craving spree!"}
{"text":"First time there I wasn't sure where to park but it's behind the restaurant or I guess on either side of it. The entrance is on the opposite end of the drive thru and there's outdoor covered seating as well as a few tables inside. Super friendly crew, delicious food!! The fries were maybe my favorite then the veggie tacos. We didn't have any issues but a lot of people had orders wrong but it was minor."}
{"text":"Its like a good In-and-out burger and fries.  Its solid, just not mind-blowing and not as cheap.  And I do mean an In and out in California, not the crappy ones out here.  The tacos are tasty too, though I'm not sure I'd pay 3 bucks for a tiny, not-so-special taco again.  Really they should put 2 per order at that price for the size of these.    They cram too much ice into their beverages too.  I love the ice (tiny cubes, mottled), but they displace so much of the liquid that you don't end up with enough.  They should also do something about the bathroom smell in that hallway when you walk in."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Phoenix after a long flight. It did not disappoint! The menu is super small but delicious. Your options are burgers, tacos, milkshakes and a few other specialty drinks. The line was long but totally worth the wait. I ordered two short-rib tacos. (You might want more. They are small.) My sidekick ordered the burger and fries. All of it was delicious. Oh, and the chocolate milkshake is absolutely essential. Perhaps the best one I've ever had!"}
{"text":"So sad to see that they don't sell any more tacos at this location . Even though they were pretty over priced $3 . Each .... they were pretty dang delicious!  The fries and burgers are pretty great . One of the better burgers you can find in the Phoenix area for sure and the shakes are rice and lush too!  Haven't had a bad experience here yet unlike other fast food establishments .... I think the Mexican street corn idea is unique to the fast food scene In Phoenix .     The stand is definitely a great burger joint competetling with in and out , smash burger Etc"}
{"text":"Killer shakes (salted dulce de leche is my fav), delicious burgers and tacos.  Takes a while to get your food but so worth it."}
{"text":"it's kind of an upgrade over In and Out burger.   If you order a burger, fries and shake it's twice the price of In and Out.  Is it twice as good? probably not but for 12 bucks I think it's really good. The shakes are amazing and everything is makred gluten free which I like."}
{"text":"As a burger connoisseur, I am proud to say this is by far the Best Fast food burger I may have ever eaten. Easily puts in n out or 5 guys to shame. The standard was large, juicy, and it tastes fresh. Fries are on par with Five Guys."}
{"text":"Delicious burger stand in central Phoenix!  We stopped in Friday night for takeout and thoroughly enjoyed the cheeseburger.  It was so delicious and left me wanting another one the next day.  The fries were subpar, but that is ok since the burger is so good.  Cute burger stand with super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Cool little hole in the wall type place. Place looked clean with retro decor but with a modern flair.  That's the good part.   I had a chicken taco and my sons each got a burger. The food is pricey for what you get.  The burgers were okay but certainly not worth over 5 bucks.  The taco had shredded chicken and pickled red onions which looked strange since they were a pinkish color. I got it with Pico.  The chicken was dry and the presentation did not look good with the pink onions.  The onions looked a bit like raw tuna.   Overall, it was pricey for such mediocre food.   Much better places in town than this."}
{"text":"Food was great, but far to over priced for just a burger in my opinion! I could go to any other burger joint and get the same quality for a lower price."}
{"text":"I had the rib tacos and Dulce de Leche shake!  The tacos were great!  The shake was unbelievably good.  The young lady who waited on me was extremely nice.  They were amazingly busy not only inside the small restaurant but also in the drive-through line. On my next trip I have to try a burger.  They were selling burgers by the shopping bag full. Great little place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food!  The concept is fantastic!  Tacos and burgers.  When you can't decide you just order both.  The food was good!  There was a bit of a line and there wasn't a ton of space but what space they didn't have was made up in the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious I had a cheeseburger and a chicken taco and it was to die for. I will be going back here very soon to try their milkshakes and their rib taco. The best!"}
{"text":"What's an in-n-out??  It's ALL about The Stand. If you've never been please stop by to try \"The Standard\" and an order of fries. Not only is the food extremely filling it's delicious.   The fries are seasoned to perfection. The burger comes double patty with all the fixings. Don't forget then Stand Sauce!  This place is a true treasure and totally worth the stop."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on the radio and had to try it because I like a good burger. The Stand did not disappoint in the burger department. I got the standard with cheese and added bacon and it was SO good! I also tried s short rib taco and it was ok. I've had better. Instead of fries I got the Mexican street corn and I loved it. Great burger place and the shakes are good too."}
{"text":"Pains me to give one of my favorite spots two stars, but removing the tacos and chips from the menu will make me reconsider coming here. We've been coming to this spot since it opened. Was such a great, unique combo - burgers, fries, tacos and chips. We had all every time. The chips were the best and the tacos were always delicious. Hope you have as loyal of a following in Scottsdale.  Oh, and the excuse we got was that the tacos held up the drive thru.... a little strange."}
{"text":"You guys are KILLING me.  I want to love this place, but the service is literally THE WORST.  The last time I went to The Stand, my fiancé and I stood in line for about 15 minutes ... with just one other person in line in front us. That person ordered a single milkshake, and it took him that whole 15 minutes to get it.  When we finally moved to the front of the line, we stood there awkwardly, waiting for someone--anyone--to acknowledge our presence. I counted 5 people working behind the counter that night, and not one of them made eye contact with us. After 5 additional minutes in line, we gave up and walked out.  I'd like to reiterate that this experience wasn't an isolated incident. I think a lot of people (myself included) ignore the crummy service here because the food is so good, but when you've given this place as many chances as I have, the whole thing gets kind of old. I really want to support this local business, but they make it so tough.  GET IT TOGETHER, you guys. For the sake of your glorious shakes and burgers."}
{"text":"YUM!  You must go here to eat if you are in the mood for any of the 4/5/8 items on the menu.  My only wish is that they offered a vegetarian burger.  We tried: The Stand burger with fried jalapenos, bacon and gluten free bun.  My husband LOVED it.  Veggie taco was amazing.  The yellow squash topped with pickled cabbage, cilantro and cojita cheese.  Squeeze the fresh lime on top.  Mmmmmm.... I didn't receive any salsa which I wish I had but it was still very good.  French fries were outstanding.  I was worried since some reviews stated pepper on them.  I do not like pepper but these were perfectly sliced and perfectly fried and seasoned.  So good.  I wish I could have eaten more of them.  Was to full for the two of us to finish the serving.  Chocolate Chili milkshake was strange.  A Mexican hot chocolate flavor with cinnamon.  I don't care for cinnamon.  The burn when it went down your throat was exciting though.  Hubby wouldn't put it down.  He was in heaven.  Salted Dulce De Leche milkshake was so so so good.  Can't wait for another one.  We had a groupon or deal chicken or something and hope to see another one soon but will be back either way.  It was HOT and we were forced to sit outside on the air conditioned patio because the 4 tables inside were taken.  The air conditioning blowing straight on you helped but it still wasn't comfortable.  Service was very attentive and the owner or manager seemed very friendly."}
{"text":"The stand is getting better and better and better. I am addicted. I find myself craving these burgers now! Keep up the good work Stand folks!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in PHX. Fries are average though. I'm not sure if their salted caramel shake is worth $5, but it is pretty delicious. Tacos are good. Quick service, nice building."}
{"text":"Appalling indifference to the customer. Understaffed, so you can spend 20 minutes waiting in line while the overworked person who takes orders and delivers orders and runs extra napkins to the customers tries to do it all. Don't come in here expecting a quick meal. Expect to stand in line. You've got to wonder if the owners have set foot in the place in the last few years."}
{"text":"I live in Flagstaff, whenever I'm in the valley I try and stop in. Their gluten free burger buns are amazing!  It's so nice to be able to get food and know I won't get sick. They also have some awesome horchata and Jamaica made in house!  Delicious food and friendly faces everytime!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, shakes,and fries.  Kind of pricey for a burger but they have great service and the shakes are the bomb.  Small seating area inside makes hot az summers difficult to eat if you can't get a table inside.  There is always the drive through!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this but I can't. I waited in line for almost 15 minutes and was told they do not serve tacos. Take it off the menu then. I walked out. Will not return. If you go for anything other than a burger, call first."}
{"text":"I love the burgers and fries but the customer service is really pathetic!  I'm so tired of people that just can't smile and be friendly it's not that hard."}
{"text":"Everything is always good here except the wait if you're eating in, and the hamburger buns.........compared to a place like in-n-out the hamburger buns here are stale"}
{"text":"Love the burger(s). Since there is only one, the Standard, you are directed to one of the best burgers in Phoenix. Bun needs work, grilled side provided good crunch, but the bread was dry and could have been softer. Worth the trip, the salted caramel dulce de leche was incredible. I'd recommend splitting it since it is so rich. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The menu at The Stand is limited, but don't panic... everything on the menu is amazing! The chocolate milkshake is the best I've had since the days of drug store soda fountains. Add on a burger, fries and a nice long hike to burn off the calories and you've got the best meal around."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and food is good - except it is horribly understaffed and slow. Just a few customers in front of me, probably took 20 minutes to order and 20 minutes to get my order. Ridiculous. And despite their friendly nature, they certainly work with absolutely no sense of urgency. Anyway, if you want to wait 40 minutes when just a few people are ahead of you... this is your place."}
{"text":"Amazing! When is this spot going to appear on food network?! Imagine an old drive through fast food restaurant that was redone in the most fashionable way. It is a mix between a five guys/modern diner with a great vibe inside with amazing staff!! The food omg!! It's a small menu of tacos and burgers! Maybe 5 items on the menu but you can't go wrong with anything. Personally if you haven't bee to this spot order a standard burger with cheese, fries and when they ask you if you want a side of ketchup and stand sauce.. ask for both! Amaaazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  I love the chicken taco and chips and guacamole.  The bacon on the hamburgers is stupid good. You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"After attending the Scottsdale food and wine festival we decided to check out The stand as it was a short drive away and we had recently seen it in a Thrillist article. We got there a little after 9pm. There was a handful of people dining at the restaurant. We ordered the standard burger with one patty as a double just seemed like too much meat, fries, and a jamaica. The burger and jamaica were excellent. I wasn't impressed by the fries as they were kind of soggy with fryer grease. I know it was late and they've been slammed due to the Thrillist article so we will be back once the hype dies down to try the fries again and the rest of the menu items."}
{"text":"I am a recent transplant to Phoenix, moving from the East coast for work. Decided to grab a quick late lunch with a family member, and left happy I decided to stop here.   Great service, clean location. Cold A/C. I love the business model without the pretentious atmosphere of most \"back to basics\" burger joints.  Prices are fair, food is delicious and I feel it shouldn't be overlooked. Waited a short time, but it was very reasonable given most food looks cook to order. I really want to go back to try the shakes as they looked great.  Only gripes to me, is that the outside seating area could use some airflow, and the fries were a TINY bit overdone for me - but delicious nonetheless.  Perfect place for a quick bite, late night snack or a mid afternoon shake."}
{"text":"Where else can I have a taco and a burger at the same time for lunch?  Do I need both?  No.  Do I want both?  Hell yeah I do, if it's at The Stand.  Their short rib tacos are crazy good, and their burgers are great with that special sauce.  I kinda want to take a bath in that sauce.....it's that good.  Don't forget the banana shake, it's the best shake I've ever had.  I know I sound kind of like a moron, but I just get excited about good food and The Stand is REALLY good."}
{"text":"Burger joint straight to the point Easy read menu No frills Fresh ground beef Fresh condiments  Fresh feel  Double patty 5 bucks.  I will return over and over   I love this place"}
{"text":"Love the Stand! Burgers always delicious, and the stand sauce is really good too. The food in general is consistently great, but the very best thing on the menu is the dolce de Leche salted caramel milkshake! Be sure to try it."}
{"text":"**3.5 STARS! The Stand is a charming little local burger + tacos joint with hidden gems in their menu. I always get 2 of their 3 tacos: short rib, chicken, and they have a vegetarian option as well which is a point in my book. Their tacos are 4/5 in my opinion. The meat is sometimes dry and can be a little too sweet sometimes but they're the perfect size and filled with yummy pickled toppings. Less than $3 each. I also don't come here without an order of chips & guacamole. Chips taste homemade and are served warm which I like! The serving of their guacamole is a little small, not the right ratio of chips to guacamole unfortunately. I had the chance to try The Standard burger for the first time and it is perfect! So close to In-N-Out which is awesome because there is none in the Central Phoenix area. And extra side of The Stand sauce is a MUST. So close to the thousand island flavor of In-N-Out spread. YUM! Every time I come here and see Mexican street corn on the menu, my mouth waters but they never have it when I come in! It's either sold out or out of season. So sad. On the bright side, they have Horchata and other traditional Mexican juice drinks which are always available. The Stand is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago. Food is good, I had a burger and lemonade. What I didn't like was who seemed to be the owner berating her employees in front of guests! Truly unprofessional , and especially when you are negative to your entire team as we are ordering."}
{"text":"Really good food but make sure you check your drive thru bag before you leave because they always forget stuff."}
{"text":"Great spot for a really high quality burger. The pics are no lie, they really cheese these bad boys up. Fresh veggies and really good quality beef make this an awesome burger. The fries were not the best I've ever had but absolutely no complaints.   The place is pretty small and very no frills. You order at a counter and there are a few tables inside as well as a small patio. It's definitely got an upscale fast food vibe while still very casual."}
{"text":"We'd been meaning to stop in here for a while, and now I wish we'd done so sooner! Great burgers (adding round short rib to the mix gives a great flavor!) and you can easily split an order of frys. My wife liked the homemade horchata as well -- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a beauty, if you like authentic roadside stands located right in the middle of metro Phoenix you are in luck. This joint is the best, no sales tax, serve up your food in Dairy Queen sacks, and get to sit on tree stomps, it's the best. Plus an added bonus the food is really solid and fresh. Both the red and green chili are excellent, along with fry bread.  Great price, nice folks running the place and just a  wonderful Arizona experience. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Is there a negative star!!!??? this place was awful, first my fries where soggy and full of grease, they were kind enough to replace them and then I took a bite of my burger and there it was a long black hair!!!  i did get a full refund for my burger but definitely a bad experience"}
{"text":"Good food, recommend it. Food gets 4 stars, but not drive thru. It's terrible. Regret it every time. 2 cars ahead of me, waiting 20 minutes. NOT EXAGGERATING. 20 minutes. But, food is good."}
{"text":"I like it. Had the burger, double pattied, with carmelized onions. The fries are perfectly salted. If you want to taste the burger and the onions more don't get it with cheese.  The salt of the american cheese is too overwhelming. Swiss would work better or provolone if they offered that i'd give it five stars."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place so badly. I had driven by many times thinking it would be a great hidden jem. Nope....burger was above average at best. The fries would have been better if they would have all been cooked but they weren't bad.   Overall above average at best. If there is a next time which I don't think there will be maybe I'll try the tacos."}
{"text":"This is amazing!  They greet you coming in and leaving. And it is real not fake like at some places. Plus they have gluten free buns and when I asked about them the owner said it was safe to eat here because she is celiac. Can you believe it?!!!!  So awesome. The food is great the staff is great and place is celiac safe. What a gem. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the Standard with cheese burger and Mexican street corn (when it's in season). They have awesome shakes and fresh lemonade. Service is always super friendly. Quick and easy to use the drive thru."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!  Customer service was excellent!  Ordered the stand taco DELICIOUS!!  Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Wow the Salted Carmel Milkshake alone is worth stop alone.. THE STAND is awesome. Not a huge menu of choice but the food is amazing.  i've enjoyed the fries, cheeseburger and short rib taco and was beyond pleased with my food. But the milkshakes are the ROCKSTAR of the burger stand , especially The Salted Dulce De Leche Shake its so damn yummy, rich and thick. The ultimate milkshake for a Connoisseur!!!!  I advise you to check it out and give those tastebuds some pleasure."}
{"text":"You would think it would be hard to screw up a simple burger. Especially when the burger is exactly half of the menu offerings. Well, The Stand did not screw up my burger today, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth.  Apparently, trendy burger joints can only offer a cool atmosphere and great food, but don't know how to run a restaurant. I was actually excited to finally visit The Stand for lunch today because I had heard about it and read up some more on Yelp! I don't recall anyone complaining about the service.  When our group arrived, the line filled the small lobby and snaked back to the door. There were plenty of employees busy in the kitchen working hard to keep up with the counter and drive-thru. I wasn't surprised that The Stand was so busy. I was surprised that the poor girl on the register was the only one taking orders. And she had to expedite the orders to the dining room and patio. And she had to bus the dining room and patio. This all happened with about ten or more people standing in line.  It doesn't matter how good the food may or may not be. It also doesn't matter how quickly the food came out after it was ordered. If your popular little restaurant isn't staffed properly at lunch time to get people in and out (pun possibly intended) in an hour, you ain't gonna be around long.  For the record, the simple options on the menu are tantalizing, the drink options are impressive, the burger and fries were delicious, and the guys in the kitchen deserve a raise for saving the day! As it is, The Stand is on the edge of the lunch hour drive time boundary. It's doubtful I will be back mid-day anytime soon."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed. This is an overhyped CenPho eatery that doesn't deliver the goods. Too many people get caught in that \"it's local with fresh ingredients\" dialogue.  I only care if it tastes good.   Our office decided to order from here so I ordered a chicken taco and two short rib tacos for $9.30. I'm at a loss to describe any good features about the tacos except to say they are small with two tortillas wrapped together around the meat. I might go back  to try the burger someday. Although I had a taste of their shake and that was decent. So that's why I'm putting this place at 2 stars instead of one star."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tacos with no cheese to go.  I got to my office and opened a bag of tacos smothered in cheese.  I tried to call, but this place doesn't even have a phone number.  I'm sure the food is good, there is an obvious disconnect from the cashier to the kitchen. Good take-out begins with getting the order correct."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. The shake 5 Stars Hands down the BEST shake I've ever had.   The burger 3 Stars  I should have ordered it well done.   The fries 2 Stars  Soooooooooooo greasy  11/9 Gave It a 2nd try $16 later  Shake is still the BEST 5 Stars   Fries  2 1/2 Stars - flavorful YES, but cold and stilly greasy   The burger 2 1/2 Stars  - I asked for It well done multiple times and it was not and this time I feel like it was over seasoned.   Needless to say I will ONLY return for the delicious salted caramel dulce de leche Shake!"}
{"text":"Insanely, ridiculously amazing! I am kind of mad I found this place...because I'm obsessed! I'll admit that I have yet to try the tacos but that's only because the Standard Burger is just way too good not to order every single time. Don't skimp and not order a shake. Once you have one you'll see what I mean! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, terrible execution. There are as many employees as diners, yet, they still feel the need to interrupt their world work flow and change tasks, for what reason, I don't know. If they had an experienced manager show them how to run the process, things would be much improved.  Drop the multi tasking and focus on the experience from the customer's perspective. From my perspective, there are 7 employees goofing off and running around without focus, while there are half as many diners, all waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Decent burger, fries were broken and difficult to eat"}
{"text":"Great grub and great, super friendly service!  I would love to see the patio \"opened up\" a little bit as it feels somewhat confined.  Maybe remove a few 2x4s of the wall and add a TV outside?  Great spot that I'm happy to have in my back yard!"}
{"text":"The burgers are nothing short of amazing. Tacos are also delicious and inexpensive. There is usually quite a wait but it's worth it! The staff is also very friendly every time."}
{"text":"Having driven through this area several times before we've passed by this place and every time we did we'd say - we really need to try that place! So, with no plans for food last night and both of us having the night off, we looked up our bookmarks and hit this place up!  It's a smaller location with a tight parking lot that also has a drive-thru as a part of it.  When walking across the parking lot, be sure to pay attention to incoming cars since it can be a bit of a blind turn for them and you will be walking directly in the parking lot pull-in and drive-thru pull-in path.   Once you are safely inside the menu is short and to the point. You can get the classic burger with or without cheese and a variety of toppings. There are a couple of types of tacos and two or three options for side orders like fries or chips.  Finally, for drinks they have bottled sodas, bottled water or milkshakes!  We both had the classic with cheese since that seemed like the staple item on the menu and when we try a place the first go round we like to try what it is known for.  We each also ordered a side of fries.  I had a shake and she opted for a bottle of water.    The burger was really tasty and I had swapped the regular onions for grilled onions, and I preferred that way over her regular ones. The fries were definitely delicious, but a touch over salted for my taste - we could easily have split an order instead of getting one order each.  The stand sauce was a great addition to pretty much everything edible on the tray!  We'll be back and we'll be trying out those taco options!"}
{"text":"Had our foster parenting training in the area, wanted a burger and yelped it. This is what came up! Burgers are great here! It's a little burger shack with a big taste! I had a cheeseburger with onions and bacon. Wife just had a cheeseburger. First, burgers come with two patties. So be ready to eat. We also had fries, which it was good. Only reason why it did not get five stars? I first wanted a vanilla shake, nope no ice cream at the time. Then I wanted a lemonade, nope lemons are not in season. Other then that it was a great visit."}
{"text":"The Stand was once one of my favorite places to eat near my neighborhood. It's close, it has a drive-thru, and you could have your pick of tacos or a burger. To my disappointment, they have recently removed the tacos from their menu.   Don't get me wrong, the burgers are decent. They are fresh and better than most drive-thru burgers. The fries, on the other hand, are sub-par. They are soggy and tasteless.   It makes me sad to see The Stand get rid of what made them unique. The last thing Arcadia needs is another burger spot. However, burgers AND tacos? That's something I can get behind."}
{"text":"Ok, so I would rate this place five or more if I could but recently they removed their vegetarian menu item, the veggie tacos! My roommates and I use to frequent this place once a week because we love it so much; however, now that one of us (vegetarian) cannot eat there, we hardly go anymore. Things I love: fries are perfect, the standard with cheese and buttered onions is on point, the chocolate chili shakes are out of this world, and I also like a half dulce de leche half banana shake. I will say that they accommodated my roommate by making her a grilled cheese, but we are requesting a veggie burger or the veggie tacos back. I beg! I will change my rating if they honor this request."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time expecting it to be as great as I have heard... But sadly I was very underwhelmed. I got the standard w/ cheese and jalapeños and a scoop of vanilla ice cream for my daughter. I thought it was \"ok\" but not wort the cost or slow drive thru service. Maybe I should try the tacos next time..."}
{"text":"Food is great and some of the best milkshakes I've ever had. However, the service here is consistently awful. They will greet you then tell you to hold on while the person at the counter runs orders. The drive through is even worse. Come here when it's not peak hours and it's an ok experience. Otherwise, try to avoid it unless you have 25 minutes to wait for a \"fast food\" burger."}
{"text":"First time going with my fiancée and it was pretty good. Burgers were HUGE!! The fries were good too. Love they use thick bacon strips instead of flimsy pieces. A bit pricey but the young girl working their said the place has great reviews. First time and will be returning with my fiancée"}
{"text":"Hmmmm...where to start... My fiancé and I saw \"hecho en...\" painted on the side of the building,  and had to try it. We thought we were going to have something close to authentic, and then we walked in. The valley girl who took our order was nice, but just, TOO much...you know what I'm saying? \"Super,\" \"cool,\" \"awesome,\" or \"fantastic\" after ordering each piece of our meal was just TOO much. However, the employees were all nice and offered good customer service. It just felt like false advertising.   The food... my burger was fantastic, with the exception that I received onions on it,  when I asked for no onions. But it was awesome. Even the pickles were legit, crunchy and crisp; not flaccid, tasteless nastiness. My fiancé had one of each type of taco. He grew up on the border, and has refined taco taste buds. LOL He rated it 2 stars. He said they are \"bougie\" tacos. He also said they may have been better if they were all around the same temperature.   Doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Fresh topping, amazing shakes, amazing hand cut fries, all with the most perfect example of an all american cheeseburger that you have ever tasted"}
{"text":"Love love love their hamburgers. I also enjoy their over the top customer service. It makes you feel better when you are spending $15 on a burger and fries. :-)"}
{"text":"First time in we were just looking for some grub, but were truly impressed. Burgers are absolutely amazing and the braised beef tacos are simply marvelous. This place will surely become one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"A solid throw back burger with some 21st century \"I give more of a damn about the quality of the products I eat\" adjustments.  Sit back and think about the origins of this great concept...I say sit back because that is what you'll be doing waiting at the drive-through.  One quick suggestion: The standard is probably too much for most of us.  Take off a patty and sell it as a 'sub standard' or something....well maybe come up with a better name first.  One more quick suggestion: Avoid the drive-thru, I've had root canals that have taken less time then it takes to get through this thing.  They get dinged a star until they can figure this out."}
{"text":"Tried The Stand twice now in a week, and very happy we tried it. It's my boss' new favorite lunch spot.   I first tried The Standard (burger) with caramelized onions. It was good, but nothing special for me. However, i later tried the tacos and that will now be my go-to. The chicken tacos were delicious, but the braised short-rib tacos blew me away! So juicy and flavorful.  But the stars of the show are the shakes. Shakes for days! The Banana Stand... Chocolate Chili... Salted Dulce de Freakin' Leche! No lie... I double fisted the first two today. I feel like a disgusting human being... But I can't wipe this smug, satisfied smile off my face. Time for a nap."}
{"text":"Amazing every time  we go. From the burgers to the braised beef tacos. Everything is soooo good. Don't get me started on the milkshakes, heavenly, no other word could describe them."}
{"text":"We just tried the new location in Scottsdale right at Shea & Scottsdale(ish) Rd at Harkins 14 plaza.  Amazing burger - absolutely delish. I like well done and it was perfect and juicy. Loved the cheese and pickles and special sauce. Great fries!! Go!!!!"}
{"text":"Got 2 Standard burgers and added grilled onions on both and bacon on one and roasted jalapeno on the other.  Burgers were hot, fresh tasting and satisfying.  Nice flavor to them.  Fries had a nice seasoning on them and were fresh cut.  Cute little place. Even have drive through."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Dolce milkshake is off the charts.  Be prepared to wait in the drive-thru line as this is not fast food, its made to order.  Met Miranda one of the managers and she was awesome, bringing my dogs treats in the line and offering to take my order from the parking lot so I didn't have to leave them in the car for a few minutes. Excellent service.  Will be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Never Noticed  I have driven by The Stand dozens of times but never noticed this little gem of a restaurants.  However, today the bright neon sign immediately caught my attention. So, my lunch companion  and I thought it might be a good place to stop and have lunch.  The menu at The Strand is simple and straightforward, one burger, a few tacos, sides, drinks, and shakes. On this visit I had  two Braised Short Rib tacos, and fries. My lunch companion had the \"The Standard\", that's what they call their burger with fries.  The braised short rib tacos were delicious. I thought the taco would would be the typical street taco, however the pickled onion, cabbage, adds something your typically Street Taco doesn't have, and made for a delicious taco. My lunch companion said the burger was delicious as well and the fries are fresh cut, not frozen, crispy, and were absolutely the best  The staff at The Strand are friendly and attentive. There is very limited seating inside and they have a enclosed covered patio outside (not cooled) similar to the  burgers stands you would see by the beach. Can you enjoy Burgers and Tacos you should give this trend a try. The food was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm taking a stand in rounding up to 3 stars.  I got there just after 9pm and was relegated to the drive-thru, so I can understand that I didn't get the optimal dining experience.  Even after a short car ride home, the burger was still great.  The onions and tomato were too thick and assertive for my taste, but the sandwich was meaty and delicious.  The \"special sauce\" provided flavor, without overwhelming.  This place is a good comparison for In & Out, where the burgers are also fantastic and the fries are subpar.  These fries had a nice subtle garlic pepper seasoning, but they were soggy and flaccid.  (Maybe that's only because of the time driving home.) The shake, however, was the biggest disappointment.  It was a below-average chocolate shake.  It had a malty flavor to it, and the straw looked like some giant breathing tube for asthmatics.  It collapsed on every sip. Add the fries and the shake to the high price tag, and you get a 2-star review... but the burger was good, and I'm holding out hope for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Great attitude ! Great food! Have had the burgers and rib tacos, and both rock! Gotta try the banana stand shake, it's great too"}
{"text":"The shakes are AH-Mazing! I got the caramel dolce du leche and I cant even begin to tell you how delicious this thing was. I would go back just for that. I got a burger and it was pretty good too. I didnt get the fries but two friends did and they said they were to die for. I strongly recommend this place if you are around Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and fries, WHEN they get my order correct. 2/4 times they have forgotten my fries and stand sauce? Lol for $17 I'll go to five guys where at least they are consistent. Also, 89 cents for a baby order of jalapeños"}
{"text":"Best burger in town! I finally gave it a try after driving past the stand daily and it is so good. Never going to In-N-Out again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites and then they made the awful decision to stop serving tacos.  Now it's just burgers which is way lame and I can't even recommend this place to anyone anymore.  Everyone I ever took there got the tacos.  Such a bad move to get rid of them."}
{"text":"I'm a burger guy and I got yo say that this place makes some of the best burgers in town. The juicy flavorful patty between two fresh baked buns topped with FRESH ingredients will have you floored and satisfied. I cannot stress enough about how FRESH the ingredients are. Including the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, beef, buns, jalapeño, and even condiments. Each bite was so good. Very juicy. Perfectly seasoned. And again you can't help buy acknowledge the superior fresh ingredients. Their delicious fries pair nicely. They have homemade horchata which I didn't try. But I did try their carne asada tacos and I was impressed.   Overall a great little find. If your a burger connoisseur like myself, I recommend giving this place a visit. Order it to go and pair it with an Arrogant Bastard. If you add a little bit of a kick to the burger like Tapatio, or if you added jalapeños, Arrogant Bastard will definitely react nicely with the spicy tones and of course the after taste will mix nicely together with the seasonings. And because of the fresh ingredients you'll be able to go back and forth between beer and burger while enjoying the zesty fries."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is right around the corner from our office. But... I should've listened to my colleague when she said it was terrible. I would give the service ZERO stars if I could. We waited in line for 35 minutes and right after my friend placed her order to go the girl said \"I'll be right back.\" I tried to explain to her that we were together and could she just please take my order so our food would be ready at the save time. She ignored me. Another employee, a short female with glasses and a headset told her to deliver food to the dining room. While I stood there and waited to place my order the employee proceeded to dry trays and stare at me... even  though I tried to explain that we were together she would not take my order. Needless to say my friend's food was ready before I even placed my order. Then when my order was ready it was placed on a tray and walked to the dining room when they called my name. Both employees knew my order was to go and that I was with my friend. I feel like they were intentionally passive aggressive with my order because I tried to explain that it didn't make sense to take a pause in orders between two customers who are together. Common sense! My friend's food was cold. The fries were over cooked and dried out in the center. My burger was very dry.  Total shame because I work in a large medical office that gets lunch out a few times a week. This place is literally around the corner. I wanted to like it!! Instead I say... keep driving... go to Smashburger instead!!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I have not had a good experience at this place pity so many people have told me it was good. Only had three items on their menu today a burger, fries and tacos.  Tacos I guess today were out of the question cause they were off the menu well covered with a piece of paper.  So focusing on two items shouldn't be hard.  Fries were soggy and very disappointing, burger was mediocre at best.  Friend got a horchata which was entirely too sweet it was more like a syrup, so she asked if she could get something else and it was as if she had three heads, so she just grabbed a courtesy cup of water and took her seat.  Few minutes later they brought her a lemonade which she didn't ask for and was way tart but she didn't want to complain anymore than she had.  Overall very disappointing and will not be going back."}
{"text":"What happened to the Arcadia spot?  They take the menu down to 2 items, standing water on the patio, which breeds insects. It was so good previously, for 13 bucks, cmon! The girl at window said \" your ketchup is in the bag\" , she should have checked the bag, no ketchup! Fries cold as ice. Good things never last:( it wasn't even cooked!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and thought we'd try something local. The burger was dope!  It's bogus for people to say how this was their favorite restaurant but that they have to give it 2-stars because they took tacos off their menus. Get the fuck out of here - restaurants are allowed to evolve, change, expand or simplify.   The menu doesn't get more simple than one burger to chose from, which I love, and it didn't disappoint. The burger - which I added cheese, roasted jalapeños, and bacon - was worth checking out.  AND it was \"Free Fries Monday\" - Bonus!  Also, their Chocolate Chile shake was bangin'!"}
{"text":"Great food -- fries and special sauce are delicious. The quality is fantastic, but you're also paying $13 for a standard burger fries and coke. Great for a elevated fast food takeout fix without the crap of going to McDonalds, etc."}
{"text":"I finally made my pilgrimage to The Stand. Here's my take on things:  (1) To add to what others have said the Short Rib Street taco is the #bombdotcom! It's so good I'm sure they have won awards for it.  (2) The standard, which I ordered without cheese on a gf bun, was surprisingly dry, but to their credit all the ingredients were fresh. Maybe the regular bun would not have been so dry? Maybe the fat content of the burger was lower than I'm accustomed to?  (3) The water cup was served in the biggest cup I've ever seen which was a nice surprise.  (4) The fresh cut french fries were suuuuuper tasty. They reminded me of fries you'd make at home.   (5) Drive thru service was slow. But, I think that's normal for this restaurant.  (6) Customer service very good and I did not notice anything that needed to be improved upon during my visit.  Overall, I'd definitely return for that short rib taco and fries....the burger?...not so much."}
{"text":"Just ate my first burger with jalapeños .  Burger was cold; it was mostly bread and not worth the 7 bucks.  Won't be going back. To each his own.  5stars for the Classic lemonaid"}
{"text":"Luxe Nail Bar in the Town and Country mall,.. The woman (Ann) that did mqy pedicure was great!  The atmosphere is great! Downhill from there! They switched me to a man (never gave his name nor asked if I liked the length, etc.) that was in such a huge hurry he actually hurt me, left rough edges on some of my nails, no massage or hot towel,.. and charged almost $50!!  Loved the atmosphere, the pedicure but not the severe SNS upcharge ($15 manicure, plus $17 for gel but jumps from $15-$47 for the SNS manicure) nor the mystery man that was in a hurry and non-interactive to the point of doing a bad job."}
{"text":"The Stand made me very happy.  Cheeseburgers made from fresh ground in house beef, perfectly melted cheese, fresh leaf lettuce, thick sliced tomatoes, onion, pickle and secret sauce.  Lemonade made in house with real lemons, Hand-spun shakes made with real ice cream (Dulce de leche is out of this world good!)   The interior is very small with a handful of tables but a few more outside on the covered patio.  Service is friendly and quick and no sooner did I finish my Lemonade when an employee offered me a refill!  In what crazy, alternate, fast food world does that happen??? For those who do not like to leave the car, the stand has a drive up window.  Taco's are also offered and I would like to try them on my next visit.    The Stand is opened 11am to 11pm 7 days a week."}
{"text":"The fries were good, the dulce de leche shake was bomb, but the burger was meh. The burger was dry, not much sauce, the bun was dry, and the meat didnt have much flavor. I wanted to like it, but it was just ok. Very expensive for just ok."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and really enjoyed the burger here. The hamburger  patties were really juicy and the fries were really fresh. I love the simplicity of their menu, there isn't a lot of options, but everything they do offer tastes awesome. I enjoyed the customer service most of all. After I sat down from ordering, they bring the food to you instead of just yelling out your order number. They also checked up on me twice after that to ask if there was anything else I needed. Overall this little burger joint was a nice surprise to my day and I recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place but the burger was awesome! Friendly cashiers and the peach lemonade was heavenly. Will definitely try the milkshakes next time!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  Nice sized portions on everything. Salsa is very good.  -1 star for the small dining room.  This is Phoenix, people need AC to eat in during July.  -1 star for the employee and the register screen asking for a tip.  I walk to your counter.  I order from you.  This is not full service.  What's next, the cashier at kmart expecting a tip for ringing out out?"}
{"text":"Hands down best drive thru tacos in Phx. Extremely friendly service. Really can't go wrong with any taco on this menu. The chips can sometimes be extra salty but I enjoy them that way. Guac is superb. Round it off with an iced tea and you're all set. Lunch hour drive thru line can be long so time your trip accordingly."}
{"text":"I had the veggie tacos and they were decent although, I expected more. Black beans are in the description but I only spotted a couple in the mix. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the cheese used either. I had 2 tacos and was still hungry. Hubby got the standard and fries and enjoyed it but said he wouldn't drive out of his way to go there again. I would love to try the milkshakes as they sound delicious and would really love it if they came up with a veggie burger-they already have quinoa and black beans, surely they could make them with those as the base ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is the place you want to go for a simple burger and fries done well.  The thick cut bacon is delicious the hand cut fries are out of this world but if you want to eat a burger you would be proud to serve at a BBQ this is the one to model from.  There is nothing pretentious about the burgers here.  No special bread, no special greens.  My only wish was that they would have a fan or two on the patio to circulate the air."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, the atmosphere is good and \"stand-ish\" but the service was slow and the tacos were not very good. The meat had a weird flavor and overpowered the little toppings they put on top. Chips were good, salsa was ok. I'd go back and try and burger and shake only."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and I was not impressed... the frys were so burned that they were hard as rocks. The burgers were alright."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers served hot and made to order. Great staff. My only knock is lack of seating.   If you want a burger just like my dad made every Saturday night go to The Stand."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Very friendly staff! The best short rib taco I have ever had! It's a must! The burger was good too just needed some jalapeños. Tasty street corn! Chips and was was good too. Best for last the salted Carmel shake!!! I'll Definitely be back and recommend The Stand to family and friends. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Stand yet. The Stand has overall a really great establishment. Theirs only one thing on the menu, a burger, and that's all you need. The burger comes with two patties with cheese and you can add caramelized onions, roasted jalapeños, and bacon. It does suck how all the good toppings are extra but it's worth it. The fries are hit and miss. When they are crispy they are delicious. Especially when you dunk them into their Stand sauce. However, they have been soggy a few times. Lastly, their shakes are some of the best I've ever had. The best one is the dulce de leche but the banana one is amazing as well. They have cool drinks like horchata and homemade lemonades. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It's a little on the pricey side but for the quality of the food I think it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Very cool place. It's easy to drive by and miss it as the building doesn't look like much.  The menu is very simple.Burgers or tacos. I took the short ribbed taco and it was outstanding. They have Mexican Coke which is a plus.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ode to a Perfect Milkshake  Oh, milkshake, milkshake, where have you been?   Safely delivered through the window and in through mine, I have found you at last. With your caramel ribbon cascading down through golden, creamy leche. Your mix is substantial, and your flavor, sublime.  Rich.  Luscious. You are so much more than any other burger joint milkshake.  You are a little dangerous and unforgiving.  You don't need or want my love, but you are still always there.  You're unrivaled, and I completely forget about your chocolate comrades.  Oh, milkshake, I wish you could stay longer.  Do not forget about me when you are gone.   Setting the fantastic burgers aside, The Dulce de Leche Milkshake at The Stand might just be perfect.    Stay gold, Milkshake, stay gold."}
{"text":"I had the glazed rib beef taco with pico de gallo and hot sauce also had a standard burger and fries with a sweet tea \"with Splenda and sugar\". First let me say this. The girl in the drive thru gave good customer service. So for that this restaurant passes in my book. The Burger was good, and acceptable. The fries were the best thing I got here. I would compare them to McDonald fries. But natural. Better than a lot of burger shops. Then comes the taco..eww it was sweet. I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the sweet juice was coming from. It was nasty. It was a bad attempt at Mexican food. Or whatever Kind of twist they were trying to create. Then the tea incident. I was given no sweetners for my tea. This was a negative. The food was notably clean. I would return."}
{"text":"The wait is just not worth it. Had 1 person in front of me at 1130am on a Friday and took almost 20 mins till I got the 2 tacos I ordered. The place is jammed pack which is fine but they should consider either a 2nd location, food truck, or expand the current place."}
{"text":"I have had lots of burgers in my life. Every time I go anywhere I have to order a burger. And I've been wanting to try the stand forever. I was looking for a quick home style burger. One that you can't get at any fast food place. And I found it. Its restaurant-quality burgers with the convienence of a drive through. Absolutely fantastic. The veggies are all so fresh, like yhey were cut right then just foe me, and the \"stand sauce\" is just right. Its not overpowering and adds just enough to the burger. No need for any other condiments. The Mexican style corn wasn't was I was expecting but it was still amazing!! Corn on the cob with lemon and lime, chili or ceyene or something and parmesean cheese.  This place is absolutely amazing. And I will be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with The Stand, the meat patty was very dry and the bread itself was dry also.  I had to add a lot of ketchup to enjoy the burger.  The burger was well overcooked.  It was pretty pricey for a burger that was well below average."}
{"text":"This place is at best OK..I've only had the burgers but there is nothing that distinguishes them from any other burger joint. Their prices are a bit steep, twelve bucks for a burger, fries and drink! Also the fries were soggy...not a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"What a great little burger/taco joint.  Don't expect too much else.  The burgers are basic, with simple add-ins like bacon, caramelized onions, and jalapeño peppers. And sometimes the basics as the best and they do the best!"}
{"text":"Probably goes to show that this is probably the worst place I have eaten at. I don't know where to begin. I don't review or bad rate places... But this had to change to let the community know... I'lo just start with my burger was so undercooked. I like medium rare but not when it's just god awful. My friends were minimal. Not that great in taste and I've heard good reviews about the shakes and sadly there was a hair in my shake. I'm not a person to complain but paying for a meal is something I do because I work in the restaurant business too as a server. But I really wish I complained because paying for something that bad was an issue. 10/10 I would avoid that place till my passing."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Great burger!! They have stand sauce on burger which is similar to Russian dressing but much better. Quick service and made to order fresh food!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a phoenix hidden gem! The banana milk shakes are absolutely amazing! The standard burger is authentic as a burger comes! Mouth watering meaty burgers on a crispy toasty soft moist bunn. With  pickles. The street corn has a delicious variety of spices on a white ear. It came on a stick in a cup! Vintage building in a historic part of phoenix, awsome people. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys in n out because the Stand is simply 10× better! Thank you for the memorable experience I will be returning with hungry friends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! you have to try the standard burger with bacon and cheese with a side of fresh cut a homemade fries and their secret sauce for dipping.  If you're in the mood for tacos I highly recommend the braised short rib tacos. They are fantastic! Nothing is frozen or premade here. It does take a while to make the food since everything is from scratch. It is well worth the wait, so be patient and dig in when it comes out fresh hot and juicy!"}
{"text":"Food was good however, the ladies at the register were not friendly. Walked in and said \"hello how are you?\" To them first. Should be the other way around. And another guest walked in and the same thing happened."}
{"text":"You can get a pretty tasty burger here. I also really like the fries and if you get a chance definitely try the salted caramel Milkshake. The menu is pretty limited which is kind of cool and forces you to pick one of their good burgers kind of how in and out does it. Overall I pop in here once in a while for a pretty decent burger!"}
{"text":"Monday's are free fries day!!!  Very great place, friendly staff and you get your money's worth. However I wasn't a fan of the drinks.. Soft drinks are 3/4 of ice. I had to get multiple refills. Refills we're free.. And I had the rib taco nice but 2bucks worth of food, if you know what I mean. I wish I took a picture with something to compare the tacos with. My mother got the burger it was nice size for what I paid, I just so happened to come on a Monday, staff informed me it's free fries day (free with only if you purchase a hamburger). Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"1-Cheese burger 1-Fries 1-Milkshake  =18.00 The burger was great. The fries were top notch. The shake was perfect. The staff were professional. The order was made quickly. The problem is that no burger, fries, shake combo should be 18.00.  In and out, Five guys, and Habit have better food for half the cost. This place needs to get real."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The stand sauce is amazing. Portion for price is just right. The potato bun is a little out of place in this style of burger. If it was a egg style bun it may be the greatest burger I've had in AZ. Fries were good seasoning on point. Mine were not crispy but the taste was outstanding. Will go again."}
{"text":"Love the food. Shakes are awesome but why does the drive through always take forever?!"}
{"text":"I've ate at The Stand many times but will never go back after my last experience. Ordered 2 chicken tacos and halfway through my second taco I bite into it and a long black hair is hanging out. Disgusting, spit out that bite and threw the rest away. I can never go back there now."}
{"text":"Their burgers are comparable to In-N-Out, their french fries have great seasonings on them, and their shakes are TO-DIE-FOR! The food keeps me coming back.  I want to like this place, in fact, I do kind of love this place... However, the service is soooooo slow. Don't get me wrong, the staff is so friendly, helpful, and my order is always correct, but everything takes so long to get out.   Two separate examples: One time, we ordered two burgers and two milkshakes. It took about 15 minutes. We had totally forgot to order fries so I went up to order one side of fries and again... 15 minutes. Second example, we went to order 2 milkshakes around 7pm one night, and I understand that they are hand-spun, but it took 30 minutes!!!!!!!! I know there are a lot of people ahead of us, but c'mon. First come first serve works for some places, but I am not sure this is one of them.   They are a small LOCAL facility with great food and I really want to be a regular, but the long wait sometimes seems preventable. I will give them one more chance (or maybe more since their milkshakes are too hard to resist)..."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the shakes are amazing. If you come here you must get the salted caramel shake."}
{"text":"Elote... maybe this word doesn't spark a culinary craving in the back of your throat like it does for me... but there are few places that have figured out the perfect way to serve roasted corn.  This is only the 2nd place I've experienced this (Elote in Sedona being the first).  Granted, I came here needing food after a night of drinking - so the bacon cheeseburger helped too.  Only other thing I got was a large Dr. Pepper - and they have the good ice, so this was a solid choice.  What I'm saying is, if you are in this area and you need to get something quick that isn't a 'chain', this is a solid choice for sure.  GET THE CORN!"}
{"text":"After reading a review of this place in the Scottsdale Republic, my wife and I decided to give it a try. It's quite a drive for us, but we were up for an adventure, and the place is in my old \"stomping grounds\" - the part of the city where I grew up.  This is a place that follows the philosophy of \"do few things, and do them well.\" On this, our first visit, we tried their burgers, fries, and lemonade, but not their tacos or shakes.   Their order-taking process is efficient, and the staff was delightfully pleasant and helpful, always with a smile.   They made my burger \"to order\" - that is, I was able to specific what condiments I wanted on (or left off) my burger. And they got the order right.  They do accept credit cards, too.  The food was DELICIOUS! It was prepared properly, presented simply and neatly, and was hot when delivered. The burger was served with one-half wrapped - so you can hold it on the paper while you eat the uncovered portion. I'm not a fan of this, but that's just me. So I simply unwrapped it completely and at it without the wrapping around it.  The location is rustic and spartan, but it was clean. There was lots of staff busy keeping the place (tables, chairs, floors) clean.  It's a long way to travel for a burger, but the food is good - if you are ANYWHERE in the neighborhood, be sure to drop by."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru for a milkshake. We waited in line behind one other car for 15 minutes. As we were waiting 2 other cars that were in line behind us got tired of waiting and drove off. When we got to the drive thru window we asked the girl how often people get tired of waiting and drive off. She said it's only ever happened like 3 times. Hard to believe. We finally got the Carmel Ducle de Leche milkshake. It was phenomenal but I can't help but wonder how much business they lose because of how long their drive thru takes!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers and the staff is super friendly. The stand sauce is worth the .50 to dip the fries in..  TIP: Be careful on the grilled jalapenos! They are HOT! ( They also play really great music.. )"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Maybe the best in the valley. Hope they open more of them especially up north."}
{"text":"This is a tiny upscale burger joint in the heart of Arcadia.  Park in the back, order at the counter and sit inside or outside on the covered patio.  The standard burger with cheese was huge and very satisfying.  Fries are free on Mondays so I scored with those!  I also had a chocolate shake that was pure creamy deliciousness.  The prices here are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a No-Frills deal burger joint! The menu is extremely simple the standard Burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and their sauce, with two patties with or without cheese. You can add bacon for $2 more, or butter grilled onions, or roasted jalapenos. There a lot of hype on the fries so they are definitely worth grabbing!  The burger: Since I have eaten here twice I think I have a great idea and just as good of a perspective is anyone else who's eaten here. Their burgers our made to perfection simply put! The patties are round, juicy seasoned extremely well and not salty or too much seasoning, you still can enjoy the taste of the beef. Both times I had the burger I got everything on it minus lettuce and tomato and I added the bacon, the grilled onions, and the roasted jalapenos. This was an extremely good burger! I tries one of the other burger places here and I would say this one is Light Years better than the other place and is it about $3 cheaper per Burger!  Grades: Burger- 9.75 Fries-8.5"}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing. The flavors went together so well! Prices were good too!! The wait for the tacos to go was a bit long though!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a quick bite in the Arcadia area! The hand-spun shakes are amazing and their burgers are tacos are 100x better than any fast food restaurant! Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Personally I categorize my favorite all time burgers.   1) gourmet burgers (sit down restaurant)  2)Drive thru burgers.   The stand having a drive thru, and the double patty with cheese burger costing only 5.99(do yourself the favor and add the caramelized onion) makes this drive thru burger a tremendous and  delicious value.   The stand instantly goes to the top of my favorite drive thru burgers list.   Living in the Arcadia lite neighborhood I've had the stand in the past, back when they used to serve short rib tacos, but since recently returning, it looks like the stand has narrowed their menu down to what they do great.. burgers and shakes!   I will be returning soon and often."}
{"text":"Burger was good but the 20 minute wait was ridiculous...we were in the drive thru and the people in front of us only got a small bag, single burger Oder, but it took 20 minutes....will consider other options next time..."}
{"text":"Best burger in town so far so good every time. Better than in n out better than five guys. Better than your burger. My burger, your moms burger, Your dads burger. It's the best."}
{"text":"Worth a visit just for the Salted Dulce de Leche shake! Get in my belly."}
{"text":"Managements recent decision to take away Tacos from the Arcadia location is a losing decision. Your reasoning for this: \"to make the drive thru faster\" is without reason. We come here and wait because the food is good. This isn't McDonald's we know the drive thru isn't fast. Not going to Scottsdale for tacos when there is plenty of competition around. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Wow! Exemplary experience!! I've been meaning to try this place for awhile now, and finally had the opportunity just moments ago.   Sometimes you just crave a good burger, and though there are some good ones around town (and no, not BK, McD, Sonic, or even 5 Guys) I wanted to try this place.  Blown away! Just the standard with cheese and a roasted jalapeño. Bun toasted and tasty, held up under the luscious middle. Lto crisp and fresh. 2 burger patties perfectly cooked and juicy, nice combo of ground beef mixture, it wasn't like a meatloaf (I hate that) and melty American cheese. Mayo I think, and oh yes, for me some toasty pepper for some heat!  Omg it was probably the best burger I've had.......ever!  It was a nirvanic experience that was over much to soon!  Add to that quick, efficient and friendly drive thru service. Five stars easy!!  This wonderful meal has barely hit my belly, and I've never written a review as immediately....  I'll def try the tacos but if I get a burger craving (I get them at least weekly) I'm headed here! I'm telling you to do the same!!!!"}
{"text":"Mind blown. The burger was amazing. The taco was amazing. The shake was amazing.   Clean interior, friendly staff, good prices and, yes, good food. A+ in my book."}
{"text":"The burgers, fries, milkshake and chicken tacos were very good.  The service though left a lot to be desired.  The food and drinks were delivered in waves.  The burgers and tacos were delivered, then minutes later the drinks, the milkshake eventually came, but no fries.  After going back up to the counter to tell them we didn't get our fries, they came long after the burgers and drinks were done.  If they could just get the timing down it would be an even better experience. I hope they do well since they seemed like very nice people!"}
{"text":"OMG! I thought I'd grab a Burger to eat at home. No doing. That Burger smelled so good I had to have a bite. I'm only a little ashamed to say I ate the whole thing before leaving the parking lot. It reminded me of burgers hot off the grill from a drive in I frequented as a teen. Now the burger is the only thing I've tried here so its all I can speak to. Its two freshly grilled patties (I order mine with cheese which was melted into the patty just right), set atop your ordinary bun with cool veggies and a sauce that gives it a juicyness, yummm! Its messy but so good. Only bad thing is I live around the corner! I see lots of cheeseburgers in my future."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but I'm weary about eating here again. I went thru the drive thru and the drive thru people tipped themselves. They email the receipts so I talked to the manager and the manager refunded and apologized that they tipped without my consent. I wouldn't go back unless I had cash only because I don't trust that they are honest with credit cards. I've seen where people change the tip numbers and I could see it happening here. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Awesome taco and chocolate milk shake. Place is busy but the employees keep the flow and you don't wait long at all. Great food!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place last night and I'm so glad we live nearby!  The burger with jalapenos and caramelized onions was to die for. Loved the egg bread bun.  The vegetables on the burger were super fresh.  Loved the fries, too!  Next time I am definitely trying the banana stand shake!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I have had everything and it was all good, but a must is the Dulce de Leche shake. One of the best I have ever had! Truelly. You 100% have to try."}
{"text":"Yummooo! This place is simple and delicious! The chicken taco, and veggie taco were delicious! I wasn't to fond of the pork. Hubby had the burger which he raved about and the fries were tasty! We also had the banana shake which was yum!  The staff was super friendly, the place is clean and seemed to be well organised!  The pricing is decent as well! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love The Stand!  Their short rib tacos are literally the best in town.  I love the sweetness from the red cabbage thing they've got going on in there and it's just super delicious.  The shakes are totally amazing and my husband and daughter love their burgers and fries!  We go at least twice a month! super yum!"}
{"text":"Updated: Was 5 stars. Downgraded to 4 because last couple visits the burger was overdone and bun seemed pretty dry. Seems there's some quality control issues. Shakes are still awesome.    Previous: Best local burger joint in town. Clean, grass fed beef and fresh cut fries fries in premium quality oil. Creative shakes are out of this world... chocolate chile brownie may not sound like your style but try it anyway. Delicious short rib and veggie tacos too. Owners are on-site every day and run production first-hand. Never felt so good about recommending a burger joint. Drive through line can get long but def worth the wait unless your in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place literally surprised the shit out of me. Didn't do any research before making the trip, just a spur of the moment snack.   Tacos...amazing. Burger, nothing to special. Milkshakes....YES! If you've never been go. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love the stand!!!! The braised short rib tacos and Mexican street corn are bommmmmbbbbb!!!! They always ask your name when going through the drive-thru too (I thought that was neat) highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Dave B. suggested my wife and I try this place to curb our burger craving. Neither of us were let down. Amazing bacon cheeseburger. The fries were outstanding, the hot salsa with the chips had just the right amount of smoky flavor (my wife agreed it was good and hot isn't even her thing) and we topped it all off with shakes. We now have our go-to spot for burgers!"}
{"text":"After many visits, no matter how I \"dress it up\" ( I have had all the accompaniments - the bacon is FABULOUS!)  the Hamburger continues to be the star. Has to be very  good quality meat, as the flavor comes through quite nicely. Pricing compared to the most expensive (e. g.  Deluxe, Zen) is a bargain and equal to Five Guys but much tastier and I believe better quality.  Not really a big fan of their fries, but I go here for The Burger and it hasn't disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, good fries and amazing guacamole, probably the best I've ever had from a restaurant. The wait is kinda long but worth it because you know it's bring made to order. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars it's because they forgot my bacon... Oh well though, it was still amazing."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm! Awesome tacos, really good salsa and amazing milk shakes. Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We have eaten here twice and gone there for just the milkshakes about six times. Each and every time the product is good as well as the service.   The burgers are good (Similar to In & Out, but a little more flavor), the fries are great, the short rib tacos aren't bad, and the milkshakes are unbeatable. The Dulce De Leche milkshake may be the best I've ever had, the banana is awesome, the chocolate is good, and the chocolate/banana is great. They will mix any flavors you want.  The decor is nice and the patio is close off and has a good feel. They are ALWAYS well staffed and the owner has been there working hard every single time we've been in. They seem to hire a lot of young kids who look to be excited to work and have great attitudes as well.   Great place and it is in my frequent rotation of restaurants.   Would it be possible to add BYOB? I don't know the rules on that."}
{"text":"The burger was incredible and the street tacos were super good too.  Would have driven by this place and never thought twice.  It's a hidden gem!  Check it out."}
{"text":"Great tacos and burgers. Shakes are pretty good. Quick stop with great service. Can't go wrong with a standard with bacon, fries and a shake for a good old fashion american meal! Loved the short rib tacos -2 would be very filling for a $6 munch option. Better than your typical fast food options."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and boyfriend after hiking Piestewa. They both got burgers and fries and I got veggie tacos and chips with guac. We all split a horchata after the meal. The tacos were great and the guac was some of the best I've had. I tried a few of my boyfriend's fries dipped in their special sauce and they were really good. My friend and boyfriend raved about their burgers and we all loved the horchata. I will definitely be going back to try one of the burgers for myself."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path.  The fry bread and tortillas are wonderful and made from scratch.  The servings are huge and very tasty."}
{"text":"Nothing super fancy, just really really good. Simple menu of fresh-made creatively-topped burgers, tacos, fries, chips and milkshakes. Service is very friendly and fast-casual speed (order at the counter, they bring it to you in 5-10 minutes). Very affordable. Location/ambiance is nothing to speak of, but it's clean. We love this place."}
{"text":"Now I love my burgers and LOVE having an option to decide how I would like it cooked. If im not given an option I am already bummed out by that time when they go straight to the amount you owe or what toppings you would like instead.  Its not that I wont eat a burger like the ones here because obviously they are good.  But getting burgers that are smashed and thin and such is just depressing to me. Its like going to an upscale mcdonalds. I am all about deals and here for the price you pay I would rather go down the street to grab a full size burger medium rare with a over easy egg on top. Now thats my cup of tea per se.  My boyfriend loves this place and i enjoy it as well. Its just not on the top of my list at first to go to... its more of like oh...okay. sure...whatever. Its good but not my favorite at all."}
{"text":"D-freaking-licious..  Got the standard cheeseburger (I believe that's what it was called) with a side of fries at the drive-thru. Food was cooked perfectly and had more flavor than a bouquet of flavor flapper flipper floozies.  Next time I will see if they accept Canadian $..  I'm.. umm .. I'm not actually sure why people still eat food out of a dumpster when this place reigns supreme."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Cheeseburger and this one did not disappoint. The burger was cooked to perfection and the stand sauce gives it just the right touch. Will be keeping this place on my list as a go to spot."}
{"text":"Keep driving on past this place , what a wreck in service .  NO Practical solution to the madness behind the counter , the cooks behind the counter are so flustered that they can't keep up with one single ticket at one time !   Orders are late , took 15 minutes just to get a burger , and after asking for the rest of our order , the confusion began !  It was a burger AND fries ! Served one at a time in 20 minute intervals !  Not a good impression for a burger that I could of probably bought down the street at circle K !  Good luck in the future , how ever long it last at THE STRANDED burger !"}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I tried The Stand for the first time tonight. My husband got a burger and I got two chicken tacos. We split a side of fries with stand sauce. The tacos were so simple but so good! I loved the pickled onion and the chicken was so flavorful. The fries were some of my favorite fries we have ever had. The sauce with them was awesome! My husband loved his burger. He loved the two patties, fresh tomato, thick bacon and the stand sauce was great on the burger too! We ended the meal with the dulce de leche shake! It was so good! The extra Carmel drizzle was delicious! Can't wait to go back! We just wish it was closer! Only thing this place needs is more seating inside."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this while I'm wiping the ketchup off of my face that I just enjoyed the best tasting burger in my life. The burger was perfectly cooked, lettuce was crispy and that BUN!!!! My anaconda wanted those buns hun!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me so I wanted to check it out, decent burger, good fries, shake cost $6 dulce de Leche was good but huge chunks of ice in my shake. I have a photo attached and that's the last bits of ice there were way more. Hard to mess up a shake."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Fantastic seasoned fries. Delicious burgers. Awesome hand spun shakes. Friendly staff, quick service, super clean. Great quality ingredients. Support local...skip the chains (yes, even In and Out, and go to The Stand). Gotta love this place!"}
{"text":"For getting rid of the tacos off the menu at this location. Be consistent with your menus at every location. It is apparent there are several people that are upset by the new menus taking away staple tacos, street corn etc. just read the reviews, tips and questions here about it and the condescending non-answers to why there are no more tacos.  Way to fail the Stand."}
{"text":"I drove passed a few times and thought to myself, \"how long has that been there, and why haven't I tried it yet?\" Well, today was the day. The guy at the drive-thru was friendly and helpful. I had the Standard burger with cheese and added on grilled jalapenos and bacon. I couldn't help but order the salted caramel - dulce de leche milkshake. I couldn't drive home fast enough to have a fat kid moment on the couch! This was easily one of the BEST BURGERS/SHAKES I've had in AZ. Do yourself a favor and check it out! If you're going to eat fast food, why not support a local, fresh made joint?"}
{"text":"\"I'll have some chips and guacamole please\", \"No, sorry, we are out.\" \"Ok, I'll have a Jamaica to drink\" \"no, sorry, we are out\".   This is becoming a regular thing here.  Too bad cause the food is very good."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers ever! We moved into our house in August and we hadn't eaten anything all day and my boyfriend went out and got us all double doubles. There was literally no conversation in the house complete silence while we ate and they were amazing I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Quality has been falling lately; stale buns, non fresh quac, cold fries, undercooked fries. Hopefully quality picks up, usually love the food"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. The restaurant itself is quaint. The staff is always friendly. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu-and don't forget to end it with their milk shake!!"}
{"text":"It's 10:45pm right now. Just got back from The Stand. They wouldn't serve me. Sorry to write this out (kind of a bummer)---but if you're thinking of a late-night burger, don't bother. They have no interest in serving you. I even called ahead and asked if they'd still make a burger and fries if I drove down. They said, \"sure, we don't close 'til eleven.''\" I drove down. One of the employees gave me some line about how the drive-thru closes at 10pm some nights. And, yeah...tough luck.  Wondering if the food's any good? Read Ryan J.'s review of 7/13. Because I wouldn't know.  In the meantime, find another late-night burger option."}
{"text":"Some of the peeps at my GF's job recommended this joint so I took my girlie to check it out. Its a quaint location but don't let the size hinder you cuz the food is delish. Super friendly staff & free refills on sum delicious drinks. Tried their tacos-they were good/ GF loved them. The burger & fry's was impressive to me. Great special sauce on the burgers & great on the fry's. As Arny says...\"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was starving and driving around with my fiancé and saw this place and thought \"why not try it?\" So happy we did! The burgers are amazing! And so are the tacos. I can't wait to try the Mexican style corn soon!"}
{"text":"SOLID! Great classic burger, good fries and the dulce de leche shake was literally life changing. Nice staff ... I'm craving it as we speak."}
{"text":"De-licious!  Their straight forward menu and very friendly service has me smiling and looking forward to my next visit.  Kudos for their bright and large signage since it made it a lot easier to find.   While looking at their menu, the workers there offered water and made sure I understood what I was ordering.  I really liked their fries and the Standard also packed great flavors. Remember when Carl's Jr. tried to advertise \"gourmet burgers at a fast-food price?\" The Stand has this idea executed perfectly.   It is a bit pricey for everyday lunch, especially with a shake, but it'll be hard for me to drive this place by without making a stop."}
{"text":"So, I'm sitting around all day Jones-ing for their food again.  It's crazy how nice they are.  The order was short rib taco, the Standard burger with cheese, and a Standard burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce.  After I signed my credit card receipt and they were getting my order ready, he opens the window and asks I would like a gluten-free bun, obviously noting the one that was wrapped in lettuce was most likely due to a gluten allergy.  He was absolutely correct.  They wrapped it in lettuce, as originally requested, and sent a gluten-free bun also.  Both observant and kind.  Come to find out, 99% of their menu is gluten-free so people with allergies or Celiac's will be happy to know that.  Thanks again The Stand-Eva, Ron, and staff.    Please go and support this place for my own selfishness of being able to keep going there myself!"}
{"text":"The burgers were wonderful, juicy, good flavor, very fulfilling. If you like a bit of extra flavor and spice, the roasted  is excellent."}
{"text":"It's probably just as good as you've heard. I had a peach lemonade (free refills!) and the vegan tacos which are pickled cabbage, black bean, quinoa, and some other stuff. You could get cotija cheese on them if you feel wild.  Everything was fresh, like the faces behind the counter. So young!   The place is kind of small, and probably not suitable for a group bigger than four. Only the inside seats are air conditioned so for the summer you might wanna go at a slower time. The prices are reasonable, you could definitely have some fun ordering a la carte here.   Next time I'll try the elotes."}
{"text":"This place is great. Tacos are good but burgers are better. Excellent shakes especially banana stand milk shake. Seasonal street corn is also excellent. Indoor/outdoor seating. Drive thru is slow and causes traffic issues in parking lot but food is made to order and staff is always happy to serve. Top notch"}
{"text":"I think in n out is alot better. It's pretty pricey and they charge you for cheese. Shouldn't a burger already come with cheese and if we don't want it we can just request no cheese?? I mean what kind of burger is a burger with no cheese?? Kinda disappointing because the meat was dry and the bun tasted like the walmart buns. The horchata was good the rib taco was good too. The taco was good but holy he'll $3 something for one taco is pricey asf. I still like street taco and you get a more flavorful one for $1.25 each. The employee was really friendly and good service. Food was disappointing, it's hard to find a good burger joint. I think l.a and home Is the only place for me so far."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who raved about the place. When you walk in, the staff greets you in unison, VERY friendly crowd. This place does burgers and tacos so I got one of each. Order came out quickly. First thing I tried were my buddy's fries, and I give them an A+, lightly peppered and slightly salted without a ton of grease, cut from potatoes with skin on. My burger and taco came out, and I went burger first. They're thinner double patties, thick butter pickle slices, tomato slice, American cheese, lots of very green lettuce, onion, and some kind of sauce. It blended together nicely, but the bun was very plain (easiest area that would take the burger to the next level). Beef tastes good, but it's not grass fed, could taste fresher...I give it an A-, but must admit it hit the spot. The taco was average,I got chicken. I give it a B-. Overall, really good burger, great fries, average taco. Half liter bottled coke is always nice touch. I hear they have good milkshakes, but I don't have room to try one. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"One Size Fit's All- or Myths and Hockey Pucks  At 1:00 PM on Thursday March 15, there was plenty of parking in the small lot. The restaurant had a clean look, with indoor and outdoor seating.   There are no Tortes, no Tacos at this location. Only Burgers and you will have it the way they want you to: well done. If you want it another way, you get story, about how the health department will not allow them to serve them rare, medium or medium rare.   With so many good and accommodating restaurants in the area, I passed on the Hockey Puck. I'd give it one start if I'd have tasted the over cooked meat. However, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.    It's not the Stand, it's the Squat."}
{"text":"Love their burgers and fries. Always add the bacon and jalapeños to mine. Like the Stand Sauce too! Try their chocolate milkshakes- they're bomb!  Their wait times used to be so long, but they've fixed that now! 5 stars for improvement and delicious food."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, several times per week in fact and I love it. Their shakes are killer (thanks for the wide straws) and the burgers are fresh and delicious. What really makes the Stand stand out is their employees. They are always the best personalities and so willing to be helpful and kind. Honestly, I have rolled through here likely over 100 times and have no ever had a bad experience. I love this place because the ingredients are fresh, the service is great, the place itself is unique and its close to home! :)"}
{"text":"Just finished up their Standard Burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, and a Salted Dulce de Leche Milkshake. Contrary to it's name, this isn't just a Stand. This is something much more rare, and better than most chain burger places. The Stand has managed to do what most places fail to do, be really good at a couple of items on the menu rather than a lists of only decent items.   The limited menu at the Stand is there for a reason. Order anything on there and it is almost guaranteed to be a satisfying experience for you. Their Dulce de Leche Shake is a nice mixture of milky, carmel-ly goodness that is a nice compliment to their rich and meaty tacos and burgers.   Definitely make a stop here if you ever have the chance!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place? This one slipped through the cracks!   Had the classic cheeseburger (a.k.a. \"The Stand\") and fries with a bottled water. The burger was cooked as ordered, and the fries were very tasty.  The staff was extremely friendly here and the place lives up to it's name with an old school ambiance and vibe.  After much deliberation and debate, I regretted not ordering a shake with my meal, and opted to get one on the way out.  They were quick to get it going for me and put it in a to-go cup for the road. I actually had to wait a bit to drink it cause it was too thick for the straw!   We sat outside to enjoy the patio. It's a closed in area, but nice and clean.   Overall: A A classic diner vibe, burgers, fries and shakes and such."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Best burgers for great prices. Haven't actually dined there, always go through the drive through. The people that work there seem to be the nicest ever! Great service. They also have homemade horchata that is so good. Haven't tried their tacos yet but when my hubby and I just want a good burger, this is becoming our go-to place. They rock! Coming from a burger lover, if you haven't tried this place out yet, you are missing out on some real goodness!"}
{"text":"The Drive Thru times wasn't that bad, 6mins. I can live with that, of course the others waited way longer. I ordered The Standard with cheese, pretty good! It wasn't the WOW factor I was expecting. Blame @johnjayvanes for that one. The sauce was okay but it didn't bring anything out, maybe jalapenos to give that extra flavor. They have a special between 11am-3pm, you get a free side of fries. Free!? Sure I'll take it. Should've actually left it, if cooked fully, it wouldn't have been bad. But over half of the fries were way under cooked, a few were still raw.  But what I really wanted from The Stand was the Dulce de Leche shake. I'm a big sweet and salty fan, plus ice cream? This is up my alley. Five bucks was on the high side, but it didn't disappoint. It looked NO WHERE near the picture posted on the main business page here. It was extra blended and the guy actually wiped up the side before handing it over (thank you for that). Regardless, it was delicious! I'll be returning for the shake only."}
{"text":"I'll take full responsibility for driving all the way here from Surprise. The previous reviews are something I'll never understand for the rest of my life.  There's a sign that all meat is prepared every single morning but what good is that if you give me a PRECOOOKED burger. A burger that even with sauce, which is a strange concoction, bacon that had the texture of jerky and roasted jalapeño, that was still bland. It must've been bland because all the salt was in my fries.  The only reason 2 stars are being given is because of the Salted Dulce de Leche shake. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and we had a burger, fries and tried all of the tacos and everything was really good. We will back soon for sure."}
{"text":"It really depends if you get lucky here. I've gotten great burgers some days and not so great burgers. I don't order tacos anymore because they're always cold by the time they get to me. The employees are really nice though."}
{"text":"Burger was descent... Fries were good, with the Stand sauce (I could drink the sauce).  Luckily I don't have too because I had the KILLER Delce de Leche shake!  That is a Pulp Fiction $6 shake!! (Only $4)"}
{"text":"Double cheeseburger from the habit+ the sauce at Raising Canes= The Stand. Which is why I say this place is nothing special. Not to mention I cannot enjoy a burger without a french fry and the fries at the stand are so overly crunchy and thin that it makes them non enjoyable for me. Plus the sauce tastes exactly like the sauce at Cane's and even that didn't help with the flavor of the fries.  However, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. Our order taker was awesome and helped make the experience nice. The food just isn't anything worth going back for."}
{"text":"Just started going here for burgers, now I won't eat a burger anywhere else! The lines inside and the lines in the drive thru can be long during busy times, and yes you do wait awhile, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!! Vegi Taco was very flavorful and i am not usually a veggie guy.  Chocolate Shake was awesome, just not on my diet. I will be back"}
{"text":"I live in the area so I frequently pass by and wonder how the burgers tasted. I finally gave them a try and was pleased with my experience. The burger and fries reminds me of a homey In n Out version. Let's just say if you try to replicate In n Out at home it would tastes like this. This inside is fairly small, but they wasn't anyone here other than those in my party. I would definitely recommend this local business especially if you live in the area."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when it first opened.  We would eat the short rib and chicken tacos 3 times a week.  Unfortunately the quality declined and so did the service.  I called and told the owner about the issues and he didn't seem to care.  I go back every once and awhile to see if it's getting better but I just keep getting different tasting tacos with hard stale tortillas and they don't even give you a lime with the tacos anymore.  I'll give them 3 stars because the burgers are still really good.  Chocolate shake is usually good but sometimes has some freezer burn."}
{"text":"The burgers are good. The fries a good. The shakes are great. The service is beyond abysmal. If you show up at lunch, there will be 10 or more people in line and it'll take them at least 3 minutes to take each person's order. So plan on waiting. The people in the kitchen, which you can see, are not busy because the person taking orders is also busing tables and can't take orders fast enough. Unbelievably inefficient. So if you're with a group, the first person will get their food and be done eating before the second person's food even shows up. What a nightmare."}
{"text":"The food was super good. The stand sauce is the best. Just super disappointed that it took 40 minutes to get our food. Apparently our ticket didn't go back to the kitchen? No manager came over or apologized about what had happened. Not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"Went to this place hoping for fantastico burgers.  The burger was reasonably ok.  Chocolate shake was made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.  I know that is a technically correct method for making a chocolate shake, but I am a purist.  A chocolate shake should be chocolate ice cream and milk."}
{"text":"The food was fast and they accept military discount. They missed part of my order so I had to wait while my family started eating :( then we had to pay again the inconvenience shouldn't equaled a free burger in my opinion anyway burger delicious and fries good. May come again"}
{"text":"A lot of goodness in this little building!  The Stand has become one of my favorite spots for burgers and fries.  Yes, they do make other things, but I have yet to venture any further down the menu board.  Yet.  The building is small, but the space is used efficiently with both indoor and outside seating.  The staff is friendly and enthusiastic - they seem to genuinely like working there, and keep things running quickly.  I am hooked on The Standard (with cheese, of course) - a juicy, cheesy creation of beauty pillowed within a fresh egg bun.  I choose to have mine without onions or tomato, keeping the fresh crisp lettuce and crunchy pickles.  Just the right amount of sauce rounds out this treat of a burger.    What is a burger without fries?  The Standard's fresh-cut fries are fantastic.  Not at all greasy, the portion is more than enough to share.  Well, unless you are me, and greedily hoard them all for myself.  Get your own."}
{"text":"Gluten free! I love this place. I can't eat everything her including the fries and the gluten free bun didn't fall apart! The staff was friendly and happy. The shakes were to die for. This is our new go to spot for sure! It has a drive through as well, which is pretty convenient. I'm telling everyone I know about this place. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love they have a vegan taco on their menu. Thank you!  Nice staff, food comes out quick, and tasted healthy!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Standard with grilled onions and grilled jalapeños for an extra $1.98. The burger came and was amazing but no extras :(. I was disappointed but once I told them they apologized and brought out the extras for me to add to my burger. Can't beat free fry Monday!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few time and never disappoints!   The short rib tacos: perfection! Perfectly cooked and marinated and just the right portions.   I could eat the chips and salsa all day.  Cheeseburger with jalapeños and fries is hangover heaven.   Bottom line, everything here is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"You've never lived until you've been to The Stand. Burger: The Stanard with a grilled jalepeno is by far the best hamburger in Arizona. The Tacos are to die for. If you like corn on the cob, imagine it grilled and slathered in a cheesy herb sauce. Yeah... it's that good. Milk shakes are fantastic. The staff is friendly and peppy. You'll never go wrong here. Just try not to order everything off the menu. It's tempting."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday afternoon, there was a line. You can't always depend on a line to be a barometer for a place. Today, no shakes because of machine not working. I told a customer who was waiting in line that this is why you always keep a backup plan, even if it is a wooden spoon and someone has to make them by hand. I could not get a receipt either because they ran out of paper. Burger is supposed to be grounded  on premises so the sign says. Customers commented that it is a In-an-Out knockoff while I was in line, which is not a bad thing. But their attempt is novice. The burgers, people like them but they are not fantastic, especially if I have to wait for over 30 minutes and it cost me$6.00. What is happening to our restaurants in America. People seem to think that if they get a reward or something called the, \"best of\" that they can just do what they want for the sake of making money! You folks can eat here but there is nothing special about this place except that maybe they have enough people in the neighborhood to support them! The best burgers start with quality beef grinder on the premise, then cooked on a wood smoked grill and everything is made in house, or locally sourced organically. Sorry but buns, ketchup, mustard, pickles,fries and other accoutrements can be done in house!Then you deserve to-ask $6.00 for a burger. But overall, support them because they are doing the best they can. I think there were some events nearby and that's why they were so busy."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger but out of the three times I've visited, I've yet to try the Mexican corn that is prominently listed on the menu. Mind you, it's been a bit since my last visit but it's always made me sad when they said they didn't have it."}
{"text":"this place is the grand master of drive-throughs.  i love that i have the option of getting tacos, burgers, chips, AND fresh lemonade without ever having to leave my car.  add a hot dog to the menu and i would flip out!  i usually go for the standard with cheese; it's huge, fresh, and super juicy.  it can often be a little bit of a mess, but who cares? this is a fast food place, people. their carne asada tacos are great as well-tender and full of flavor.  i'm not usually a banana person, but their banana stand milkshake is so so good and unlike any milkshake i've had.  definitely give it a shot if you want to try something new!   my only issue with this place is how backed up their drive-through can get, especially during peak hours.  they make everything fresh, so it obviously takes a little bit longer than your standard fast food place, but sometimes it can take 25+ minutes to get your food. i'm not sure if they need more people dedicated to cooking for the drive-through only or what, but i would give them 5 stars if they resolved this!"}
{"text":"Vegetable tacos are so delicious! I've only had them vegan, but you can get them with cheese. We get them with the hot sauce...goes well with the pickled cabbage in the taco. YUM! (Meat-eaters in our family say the hamburgers are very good....but I have no direct experience!) Fries are crispy and I like the salt AND pepper on them.  Now for dessert...the shakes are so good that I have stopped getting them. The salted caramel was so amazing that I was craving it and finding reasons to stop there more than once a week and get one. And my behind does not need any extra shakes!! Try one if you've got some extra calories left."}
{"text":"They only have a few options on the menu (which shows to me that they're confident in what they offer). The burgers are very high quality. I think they even put rib meat in them. The customer service is great, they walk over and give you your food at your table and pick up your tray when you're done. The fries were fresh tasting and weren't too greasy. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait a lil bit.  We arrived around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was a line out the door, probably like 6 people ish ahead of us, waited about 5 minutes to order, and another 10 to get food, but they bring out your drinks to you while you wait so it doesn't feel like a long time at all.  Very friendly cashier to order with, explained options, then you choose a seat, and they find you and give you your drinks and food later.  The cheese burgers are excellent, get grilled onions if you get a chance.  They also have great horchata, nice and creamy and just the right amount of sweet.  You even get free refills apparently if you stay long enough."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, cute place. I enjoyed my burger but the burger was a bit try. My fries kept breaking in half so they ended being tiny little fries on the bottom of the plate. Delicious fry sauce! Overly sweet lemonade must add water."}
{"text":"So I have been back 2 times since my first review.  I tried the tacos, I tried the Chips and Guac and I tried the Dulce De Leche Shake  Tacos are decent - Chicken nothing to write home about, short ribs were good Chips and Guac were good, but not on the level of chipotle  Dulce De Leche shake was awesome.  Very very tasty.  In other words I wont be coming back here for the food.  I will come back for a shake."}
{"text":"Yes hands down the best hamburger in Phoenix, even surronding areas! Staff Patience and Adriana work with a smile to insure you get exactly what you want. Not expensive for the quality of the three cuts of meat combined and ground on site to make the perfect meat to put between a lite tasty bun."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries - kinda like one step above In n Out. I haven't tried the tacos or shakes, but I definitely will next time (salted carmel dulce de leche...were they reading my mind???).  We went inside to order around 11:30 on a weekday, and it was medium busy. Our food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered. Prices are ~$5.50 for a cheeseburger, $3 for fries, so it's on par with a 5 Guys or something similar. For the same price and the same quality, I'd much rather support a locally-owned business."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Oh my gosh, the burger I had here was so delicious. For a burger (add sautéed unions) it was around $6 , which isn't terrible, its a step up from fast food so worth the $6. Also, I loved the french fries, so fresh and tasty. The service was good and quick, next time I'm in the area I will defintly be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was reminded of the original Matt's Big Breakfast when we walked into this place!  It is ridiculously tiny, but what space they do have is maximized.  I had the Standard burger and it was super delish!  I am not the biggest pickle fan, but that was my favorite part of this burger.  The shakes are also fab.  I do think it's a bit over-priced and the menu is limited.  My husband had the short rib tacos and said he enjoyed them.  My friend had the elote and did not feel it was worth the price.  Over $2 and it was not even a full ear of corn!  The staff was very kind and patient as I tried to figure out what my kids would eat.  I won't be a regular, but I did enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"The Stand Burger is one of my top 5 burgers of all time.  The caramelized onions are too die for.  I love caramelized onions and I had no idea they could taste this good.  The beef and onions are so good that I order my burger with just lettuce, cheese, & onions so as to let those flavors dominate.  Their shakes alone would bring me back.  Dulce de leche and banana are my 2 favorites.  The fries tend to be a on the short side and a bit soggy but I'm not big on fries so I can easily overlook that."}
{"text":"Ok! Got a $20 for $10 deal on Deal Chicken so I had no excuse not to come back and try the banana shake and rib taco I mentioned in my first review. Ohhhh man, that shake is so good. Real chunks of banana in vanilla ice cream blended with banana syrup - it tastes like the best banana pudding you've ever had, only frozen. I'm a huge fan of banana anything (obviously) so this was a real treat for me.  The short rib taco was street taco style with pickled cabbage, onion, and cilantro with some sauce. It was a little spicier than I expected (but I'm really sensitive when it comes to spiciness!) that was probably from the cojita and cremoso or whatever the meat was basted in. It was really good, though! Good thing I had the milkshake to wash it down with. Got the same burger and fries as last time. Muy delicioso.   What I assume is the owner was in again and is super friendly. He commented on my Star Trek shirt and we had a quick chat about the new film while my food was being prepared.   The only con for me is that it's not near my house or anything I ever go to. I wish it was downtown!"}
{"text":"My biggest problem with The Stand is the terrible pricing.  How in the world do you charge 4 bucks for a tiny barbacoa taco?  And the nerves to call it \"Short Ribs\"?  The food itself is quite delicious, but taking into considerations of the pricing, it falls far short of being acceptable.  You're better off just heading down the street on Indian School and buying a taco from a small Mexican family owned restaurant.  At least you'll know it won't cost a arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger/milkshake.   I did order 2 tacos (short rib and chicken) only to find out that once home they had given me just 2 veggie ones.  Even my meat lover brother in law enjoyed the veggie tacos and my daughter and I found the milk shake and burger good.  A little pricey, but overall tasty and a nice addition to Arcadia."}
{"text":"The Stand was one of my favorite restaurants but their menu changes with no tacos and higher prices with a lower quality product make it a business I will no longer frequent."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place when we were by. Menus is very limited and overly priced! Their food is over rated by staff. I had a chicken taco and a beef taco which are the only tacos listed on menu. The chicken taco had very little flavor. The beef taco was ok nothing to die for...  I think I paid @ $ 10.00 for the two tacos and a median drink."}
{"text":"Just moved to town and was in the mood for a quick burger. After doing some Yelp research, I settled on this place based on the reviews. Came here and got The Standard with cheese, fries with Stand sauce, and a vanilla milk shake. Everything tastes good, but it was nothing out of this world. The food was nice and fresh, but I feel like the burger could have been seasoned a little more. The fries were pretty good, nice and crispy, and I do recommend getting the Stand sauce to go with them.  Would definitely come back here again, but I don't see it being anything I go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"The food was actually decent but the not worth the experience of waiting for over 30 mins. I understand that they were having their lunch time rush but the employees were not working smart or time efficient. I think their management should be over the age of 18. Never going back again"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and although the burgers were good, I probably won't be back. First and foremost they are way too over priced. $30 for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries, and a vanilla shake? Not to mention a burger does not come with fries. You have to order this separately. Second, it takes way too long to actually order and receive your food. And last but not least, I was last the person to put an order in before they ran out of burger patties. How do you run out of the only thing you make? Literally their menu consists of The Standard Burger and fries. There were about 8 people behind me who left. The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 2 was because their fries were fresh and crispy. The burger... ehhh it's like a glorified Five Guys burger."}
{"text":"On the east coast where I'm from, it's not uncommon to find In-n-Out clones, because the franchise doesn't really go any further east than I think Dallas.  Many try to copy the formula, and some put out a somewhat decent burger, but when the day is over, they're still no In-n-Out.  During a day trip in Phoenix, I was really craving hamburgers, so doing a cursory search for burgers, The Stand's name came up several times on various aggregate sites and lists that were pertinent to the best burgers of Phoenix.  And this wasn't my first time in Phoenix, so I was aware that there are In-n-Outs in the general metro area, but when I travel, I typically want to try new things.  Needless to say, The Stand is undoubtedly an In-n-Out clone as far as I'm concerned, but I don't necessarily mean that as a pejorative.  Typically, I wouldn't imagine a clone to be in an area that actually has the original, but here we stand.  Regardless, The Stand seems to have captured the loyalty of the locals, and on top of the Internet praise they get, they've captured some legitimate titles within the city proper itself, shown on the walls of the restaurant upon entering.  Speaking of which, The Stand is located on Indian School Road; I know this describes nearly 30% of the businesses in the metro area, so it's like on the part of Indian School Road kind of due north from ASU.  Without a rental or Ubering, I was able to get to it very easily on public transportation, using the 41 line on the Valley Metro bus, with a stop maybe 25 steps from their door.  The exterior of The Stand looks like it used to be a fast food restaurant, but at some point the zombie apocalypse came and went, except The Stand didn't bother uncovering the Windows.  That's my trying to be funny way of saying that it's kind of a window-less building surrounded walls you can't see through, but the interior is kind of a typical restaurant.  Small, but not unlike most.  Service was super friendly and nice, but I have to say that it was kind of slow.  I see some redundancies in how the employees operate, and it leads to some slowdown in taking orders, and I wondered why they only dedicated one register for inside orders, one for the drive-thru, but didn't utilize the third one at all.  It wasn't at all an efficient visit, but the food was still top notch and capable of overlooking the speed.  As stated, the menu is basically an In-n-Out clone.  There's something charming about the simplicity of a place that literally only serves a hamburger with/without cheese, fries, shakes and soda.  Admittedly, the \"burger AND taco\" description of the place was what drew me, because who wouldn't want a burger with a side of taco??  But I discovered that The Stand no longer served tacos, and a part of me was I'm not mad, just disappointed by the revelation.  Seriously, that was a huge letdown, and the business is in serious need of a renaming because that's straight up false advertisement.  Whatever though, the burger was fresh, and tasted about as good as an In-n-Out experience.  I will say that I actually liked The Stand's fries more, as they actually season them, instead of just being given old and crusty salt and pepper packets.  However, the price wasn't very In-n-Out like, since my burger, fries and a lemonade ended up ringing me $14, which is almost twice what the classic In-n-Out #1 costs.  DIdn't think about it until after the meal, but yeah, they can get pricey for a burger-fry-drink meal.  Overall, I was definitely satisfied with the product at The Stand.  It warrants the praise it gets, but from an encompassing experience, I thought their service was slow and the price a little high.  The food and the friendliness are big pluses for them, but in the end, I'll go with a 4, rounded up from a theoretical 3.5."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when I want to indulge. The burgers are amazing and the fries are fresh. I love the stand sauce. One of my favorite places to get a burger in town, it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow, everything was great but you do not want to miss the shakes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch yesterday, we had never been but had heard great things.  We each had a cheeseburger with caramelized onions on it.  Delicious!  We are excited to go back and try their tacos.  Everything is made to order, so food is super fresh.  The burgers are somewhere between In-N-Out and Five Guys-- it will be our new go-to fast food burger joint.  Fries are shoestring outta this world good.  Oh! And the staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"\"Quite frankly, I don't recall ever giving THE STAND just four stars, but they just keep impressing and impressing.\"  Wait, what?  Well, that was then and this now. Counter help kept me waiting for change of a $5 for an already overpriced $2.50 drink. (Let me remind you there is no tipping for to-go orders, no matter how many tip jars somebody at Starbucks has achosen to put out.)  The Stand now stands as waaaaaaaaaaay too full of themselves...I suspect they've been reading -- AND BELIEVING -- their own press clippings...?    How much tip do you think would be appropriate on a $2.50 drink to go?"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, therefore I get the veggie tacos.. But I really wish they had a veggie burger!! The chocolate chile shake is my go to \"I'm feeling lots of feelings\" shake and it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Wasn't my favorite burger I've ever had. I was excited about the hand cut fries but they were old and stale so I was super bummed. Not sure what the fuss is about. I guess I can say I've been here and done that but I won't be rushing back anytime soon....especially not for a 15 buck lunch."}
{"text":"Quick and easy drive thru. The standard burger is delicious. The burger has two not-oily quality meat patties with fresh good quality lettuce. The banana stand shake is incredibly good. It is packed with real banana and not too sweet.  We did not see the taco on the menu anymore."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries. They have a ranch bacon that's money. The fries reminded me of In and Out fries just seasoned more. The only downside was the wait. With only one car in front of me a fifteen minute wait in a drive thru line was torture on a Friday night at 9pm.  I noticed shakes on the menu and will give one a whirl next time."}
{"text":"Drive thru is so-so but really good burger for a really good price! Glad it's not the BS $10+ burger like some other spots."}
{"text":"Seriously so delicious! I had the short rib tacos and they were phenomenal. On top of my delicious food, the customer service was top notch. The wait time is only slightly longer than your typical drive-thru, but considering the quality of the food and the over all experience, I would have waited as long as they needed me to! The only negative is that I have lived in AZ for almost 3 years and this was my first time going! I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Burger is fantastic, and excited to try the tacos."}
{"text":"OK, people: GLUTEN FREE HAMBURGER BUNS are available here! In fact, everything on the menu is completely gluten free except for the cheeseburger/hamburger with the regular bun. The staff members were very friendly and they also noted to me that they take great precautions to avoid cross contamination. They even asked if I have an allergy (which I do). The food was fabulous! I got the cheeseburger with the gluten free bun (obviously) and it was really good. I definitely couldn't stop eating it even though I was getting full. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The food was hot and did not take too long to arrive to our table. My mom got a cheeseburger with the regular bun and just pickles and tomato. They got it just right and my mom loved the food as well.The fresh squeezed lemon juice definitely sealed the deal. And they have a drive though! I will be back to try the tacos or maybe have another cheeseburger...we will see."}
{"text":"Like most paying customers, I crave consistency when i'm spending my hard-earned cash at a food spot; I used to experience that consistency here, but as several others have mentioned, all good things come to an end. As a 10+ year resident in the area, it truly saddens me to post this, but at this point it's just a lost cause & the least I can do is hopefully help someone else to save some time/cash/disappointment. Used to come here & the burgers were cooked to perfection, everything was fresh, the milkshakes were delicious & the employees were friendly. Now the burgers (along with the milkshakes) are hit & miss depending on who is in the kitchen, they continuously mess up your order (as if they actually have more than 3 items on the menu), the folks in the kitchen spend the bulk of their time goofing off rather than putting some effort into the quality/preparation of the food that you're paying them to make, the food is VERY pricey for what you get, & (worst of ALL, in my eyes) the people who take your order are SUPER snobby. Like seriously, no \"hello\" or smiles when you walk in the door anymore, & as you stand there looking at the menu on the wall, they don't even ask how they can help you (or even acknowledge you for that matter). This one small-framed/nerdy (Asian/Latino?) girl just stands there w/ these thick coke bottle glasses on & blankly stares at you instead of asking if you need any help or asking you if you have any questions about the menu/etc. Basic customer service etiquette that even someone like myself could master in minutes... I thought the 1st time might have been a bad day for her, maybe she was on her period or something, so I came back & yeah; Had the exact same experience with her... Like she's a robot or something, & you're paying her to be as bland as possible. Awesome.   Order a burger here now; Expect to have to send it back 3+ times until they actually cook it right/as you actually ordered it. Order a milkshake here now: Expect it to be either super thick (to where you can't even drink it) or \"whipped\" to a point where it tastes more like pure whipped cream rather than an ice cream shake. When made right (aka- with the type of meat you actually requested [i.e. chicken vs short rib]), the tacos were great; The keyword here is \"WERE\" because of course they took the tacos off the menu... When it came to the uniqueness of how it was made & quality, my favorite was the Guacamole & YUP you guessed it: They took that off the menu as well (shortly after hiking the prices). Catching the downward trend yet? You should be.  What's that?? Ohhh, you're on a tight schedule & wanna save some time by goin through the drive-thru? GOOD LUCK... Unless you have no cars in front of you, you're gonna be waiting upwards of 10-15 minutes, regardless of the time of day & regardless of how small your order may be. Whether you use the drive-thru or walk in, you better demand a receipt because they sure won't give you one otherwise (even though they sure WILL remember to have you sign THEIR receipt if/when you pay with a card). \"Oh come on, you didn't get a receipt, what's the big deal\" you ask?? For those on the slow side (including but not limited to some of the folks who work at this place); If you go out to eat somewhere & get SICK (food poisoning/e coli/salmonella/etc), you have no case if you have no receipt to prove that you ate there. Think about that the next time you go here (or anywhere else for that matter) & have to deal with folks who constantly act like they don't want to provide you with a receipt for the food you're about to consume.   I used to really love this place & frequently recommended it to MANY people, but the recent lack of consistency in terms of the quality/preparation of the food, in addition to the lackluster customer service (& piss-poor attitude of the folks who take your cash) has caused me to take my business elsewhere. I'm sure that losing one long-time customer won't hurt them too bad, but if they lose enough customers (which is bound to happen if things remain as they are now) it could spell danger for the company as there are MANY more options in the Central Phoenix Area (Shake Shack, Hopdoddy, Chicago Hamburger Co Inc, BurgerFactory, Lenny's, Smashburger, In&Out, McDonalds, etcetcetc) that are CHEAPER price-wise, that have FRIENDLY employees & are CONSISTENT with the quality/preparation of their food. Had a good run with these guys initially, but all things truly do come to an end, things have changed for the worst here & at this point it's just time to move on. Throw your money away here if you wish, but as far as i'm concerned this place doesn't deserve another cent from me until they hire better people, lower their non-competitive prices, return to the level of consistency that they used to have & put more effort into the quality/preparation of their food. Visit at your own risk, or be one of the smart ones & skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"The best quick local burger in town. The fries? Not bad. Mexican cokes? Check. Super melty American cheese in the middle of the burgers? Check.   All good."}
{"text":"Decent burger and tasty tacos. Nice pit stop if you are craving rich food. Note: You will find yourself waiting in a long line, at least for the drive-thru. I am sure the food is cooked fresh but sometimes I just don't have the patience."}
{"text":"My friends had been hyping this burger joint since I landed, so I was eager to see what it had to offer.  One night after they finished work / school, we finally made our way to it.  It has a drive-thru, but we decided to go inside.  My friends told me that they have both burgers AND tacos.... but now it seems this location only has burgers.  Turns out this happened within the last two months, and a new location which they call the GRANDE Stand, opened in Scottsdale... they have burgers, tacos, AND a bar apparently.    So I was limited to a burger, fries and milkshakes.  So what did I do?  I GOT IT ALL!!!  I decided to do the Standard burger, which is a double patty that comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.  I got the fries that come with \"stand sauce\", and I went with the  Banana Stand milkshake... my goodness.  The burger?  Top 3 best burgers I have had, and I don't regularly eat beef anymore.  The fries were bomb too, especially with the stand sauce, though with some bites I found the sauce to be quite salty.  Despite being salty, I absolutely loved the flavor.  As for the shake... I can't believe I once said Checkers / Rally's had the best banana milkshake ever.  No... this shake had big banana chunks in it and it tasted wonderful!  It was visually appealing too, with the yellow swirl on the cup.    I'm sure it disappointed many people that they got rid of their tacos, but their food is great nonetheless.  I don't think I'll be going to In N Out anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! The food is made from quality ingredients and tastes phenomenal. I had the burger and fries and they were both delicious. The staff was very kind and helpful as well. Def recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I am very pleased to have another great spot to eat at in the neighborhood.  THE STAND has a great burger . . . make sure you order it with cheese and the butter caramelized onions.  They have short rib tacos and veggie tacos and they are excellent and well priced.  If you like a milk shake with your burger, I'd order the chocolate . . . I'm not brave enough yet to try the chocolate chile shake but I hear it's something you have to try.  You'll also be treated very well by the great staff. Keep up the good work Ron and company . . . I vote with my business and I've been there 3 times in 10 days which speaks volumes."}
{"text":"I love this little place! Great small menu. Very consistent. Best milkshakes in town!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were really good, one of the best I've had. They grind their own hamburger meat and you can definitely tell. Their fries are delicious and I had a chocolate chili shake that was really good too. We're pretty new to Phoenix and this place will definitely be someplace we go again and tell people about"}
{"text":"came here with friends and family. We ate on the covered outside patio. I ordered The Standard w/ cheese plus roasted jalapeno peppers and bacon. It was pretty good but for some reason you don't get much bacon or peppers. My wife started eating mine and took a few bites before we even noticed she was eating my burger.  The fries are really good and I also got the banana stand shake and was also very good. will be back, hoping for more jalapeno and bacon though."}
{"text":"I saw an article mentioning them as the best burger in Phoenix so I was immediately intrigued. I was not disappointed and it will be one of my go to places for burgers from now on!  This is a no frills burger place. The menu is tiny and that's important. \"We make a few things and they're awesome!\" The Child had a Standard with cheese, fries, and a chocolate milkshake. I had a Standard with cheese and bacon only, fries, and a Mexican Coke. So good and fast. Meat was cooked almost well, but was still extremely juicy. The fries were twice cooked and didn't need any additional salt. The Mexican Coke was the perfect touch and I never do caffeine or soda. The Child's shake was thick and she couldn't finish it.   Whenever I want a burger and fries, this will be one of the few places I go!"}
{"text":"The Standard Burger tasted good but definitely not worth $4.95.  The two beef patties were small and overcooked.  The fresh cut french fries was really good.  I also had the short rib taco and I was probably the driest short rib I have ever had.  There was no moisture content in the meat at all.  I couldn't even finish it because the texture was so unappealing.  Pretty disappointing considering all the praise on yelp."}
{"text":"In n out has a run for it's money. I got a double cheeseburger with all the fixings. Added bacon butterflied grilled jalapeno and caramelized onions. It's everything I wish in n out could be. If these guys ever with nationwide it would be over. The fries are also fresh and crispy straight out of the fryer. And their stand sauce is one of the best I've had. Go to burger joint"}
{"text":"The meat was probably rotten and stunk . It had a funk too it. I was not given a receipt. I really wanted to like it and maybe it was an anomaly, but it was awful. I would figure by the stench they would know. The fries were also soggy ."}
{"text":"Horrible service and definitely not worth the wait. You're better off going to The Habit or Five Guys. There's nothing special about these burgers when the wait is an hour long and the staff can't even acknowledge that the customers are in line. It took around 30 minutes for the staff to come out and attend the line. They were too busy prioritizing drive through."}
{"text":"First time was a 4.5 star experience, today's return was a fail and I probably will not return for a 3rd visit.  When you are paying $13 for a burger and fries - and have to sit outside in Phoenix to eat it, you expect everything to be very good.  Today I put in my order and as I was paying I asked for the wifi password.  The young woman at the register said they didn't have wifi.  Well, they do, and right behind her shoulder was a Nest Thermostat - which only works off of wifi.  I pointed this out to her and she said nobody knows the password.  Ok, fine.  You don't want to provide a free thing to your customers I guess that is your prerogative.  I ordered my burger without tomato.  I said it twice to make sure she got that.  Normal wait time, she delivers my burger and fries.  The fries were 300 degrees and had about a quart of excess oil on them.  The burger...  of course it had tomatoes on it.  Then, when I take my first big bite of burger the other woman comes right to my table as I bite down and stands there asking me questions about how my meal was.  Seriously?  She stands there chuckling as I have to chew with her staring at me.  This made everything taste like garbage.  That is THE worst move in a restaurant and for that I'll never return to this one.  I'm still seething that she had to RUIN the meal that I paid and tipped well for.  I was about the 15th customer of the day, and my $2 in the jar were the only $2 in the jar.  A few blocks east on the south side of the street is the Chicago Hamburger company.  Go there.  They don't try and hijack your meal there and have enough seating inside for their customers."}
{"text":"They are run by a couple - and one has celiac. For a gluten-free neighbor, that is huge. I would come here every day if I could. Sometimes I do! You can get GF tacos, and they can also make them vegan or dairy-free, which is great. They have gluten-free buns for their burgers - I just wish they made turkey burgers too, and my life would be complete and I'd have to buy them roses every valentine's day! They've got a lot of kids working there, but they are hard workers, so don't be turned off, thinking it's just another fast food joint run by people who don't care about what their doing - their food has real love in it, and it's quick service, with a drive thru that is typically open late. Don't forget to get a real Coke from Mexico when you visit! Hecho en Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Small place, limited menu, however, what they do they do good... YUM, I had all three of the taco's.. excellent... Veggie, Chicken and Short Rib... I really liked them and plan on returning to have them again, then again, their hamburger looked pretty awesome as well.  Nice to find a place different from all the chains... I shall return..."}
{"text":"I am officially a Stand junkie. It only took one time.  I found The Stand on Yelp a while back, and when we tried to go they were closed for a holiday party (nooooo!) so we had to ignore our burger cravings and go get hot wings (well, that actually wasn't so bad). Last night my boyfriend REALLY wanted a burger and insisted we go.  I had visited their website and figured there was no way the burger was going to look like it did on the website...I was wrong. But, I get ahead of myself. We walked in and ALL the staff were super nice. We ordered two Standards with cheese, drinks, and BF got fries (with their special sauce on the side). I totally forgot about their street corn and am cursing myself for not asking about it (but it's seasonal so maybe I'll have to wait anyway). BF got the grilled jalapeños on his burger, I didn't.  HOLY MOLY. They brought our burgers out and they were gone before I could even snap a picture. They DID look just as awesome as they did on their website. When does that ever happen? The beef cuts combination they use for the burger (short rib, chuck, brisket? I think that's right) makes it the best burger ever. The bun was awesome, the pickles were perfect (not the crappy kind you get in a jar, like most places throw on theirs). Overall, it's a super simple, not fancy burger that is perfection. The fries were a little crispy for my taste but the sauce that came with them was awesome.  The combination of the awesome food, super reasonable prices considering how great the food is, and beyond-nice staff means this will be one of our new go-to places."}
{"text":"Did not have all the menu items that were posted bc many are seasonal which was disappointing bc really wanted street corn. The burgers and fries were delicious and the stand sauce was awesome. The fresh strawberry lemonade was heavenly."}
{"text":"WOW that burger was good!! I wasn't planning on eating a whole double burger.... but I just couldn't stop :P Fresh hand-cut fries and homemade lemonade. Nothing at all to complain about, delicious :) And the staff was very friendly walking me through the menu for my first time there! Be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place because some friends have said its really good. Finally, we made it for a late lunch at 2:57PM on a Monday. Apparently before 3PM it's free fry Monday! Anyways, the menu is very simple, not too many options (which for an indecisive person like myself is FANTASTIC). I had a burger with jalapeños, cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomato (heaven in my mouth). The fries were soooooo delicious. My boyfriend and I got one fry which was perfect because the burgers have a double patty...such a pleasant surprise. They have their house sauce on the burger which I decided to have on the side to try and let me tell you....I am NOT a sauce person. I hate any house sauce restaurants have (this includes in-n-out)....however The Stand has sauce that was great for their burger and their French fries.  The customer service was great! Very kind people which just makes for a great environment!   Long review short, go on Monday before 3 to get a free fry and their burgers are one of the best I've had...and I've had LOTS."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I don't understand what all the hoopla was about. It's like a glorified In and Out burger. The burger was good, the milkshake was gross. I'd prefer a Freddy's or Whataburger Shake to the chocolate one I had from The Stand.  It was decent, but nothing to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Completely worth the money. Very filling and delicious. I won't lie it reminded me of an Inn & Out Burger, but I really enjoyed it. I only rated 4 stars because service was painfully slow and not the best, but I recommend The Stand."}
{"text":"Pros: outrageously delicious burgers  Cons: I don't live here  My sister took me here because she said they had the best burgers. She was right. Their double party burgers were to die for and cooked perfectly. They have a sort of sautéed onions (and I don't even like onions that much) that make it even better.   The fries and sauce need a paragraph of their own. The fries were cut small (my favorite) and not over done or too soggy. It was a mixture of both textures at the perfect level. The sauce could seriously be eaten by itself. But I just really like sauce, good sauce, mind you. It wasn't just mayo and ketchup, there were spices from another world.   Go here. The coke is huge too and comes in a glass bottle, and made with real cane sugar."}
{"text":"I was so very excited to try this place! Unfortunately they didn't have a lot of stuff in season which i understand. It must mean they buy fresh not processed.  Burgers were very tasty and fries too. I was a bit surprised by fries because  they didn't look like other yelp reviews. I like the seating outside.   Somewhat pricey for two people"}
{"text":"The Stand is a neat spot that I have been wanting to try for a long time and finally did today.  I try to always give the best possible review but there just isn't much to go on here. Service 5 stars. Food 2 stars because it's just meh and really expensive in my opinion   Service. The young man behind the counter was very nice and helpful.   Food. We each ordered versions of the stand burger and fries with shakes. The burgers were all slightly well done with little flavor. The fries also were lacking flavor. None of it was bad, it just wasn't god either.   The shakes were really good. Also the short rib taco was amazing.   Cost: it's pricey for what you get.   Not likely to come back to the Stand."}
{"text":"Great quick burger.  Awesome fries.  Basically a locally owned In and Out but better."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a burger from The Stand, but wasn't hugely impressed. I got a burger protein style, so wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. The entire thing fell apart before I could even pick it up. It just felt like an underwhelming burger and an underwhelming experience. But we shall carry on and try again, this time with bread and a shake, and see how that goes."}
{"text":"epic food, simple menu. so many drink options! I will be going back and hoping they start the spring and summer items soon!  friendly service and hardly a wait. we went in and within five minutes had our food brought to us. we tried a burger on a gluten free bun (thank you for making it an option!)  the short rib taco is amazing!!! you can tell everything is fresh and hand made. I can't wait to go back and load up on tacos, maybe even try a milkshake(I'm not a big sweets fan) this place is very clean and easy to find. thanks for an awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"Update: So I finally went back and gave it another try since last Fall. It seems the Burger quality is back!  Fresh and made to order. I will admit I didn't order the fries in fear of running into the same issue as before and settled for the chips and salsa. But I am going to assume everything is back to normal.."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out. Simple straight forward menu -- Burgers and Tacos with some sides. The short rib tacos are amazing. You can tell everything is home made -the two salsas are great, and the guacamole is good too. The burgers look good -way better than In and Out but in the same style -- thin patties but a great sauce and fresh veggies on it -you can get other toppings too like jalapenos and fried onions. The milk shakes are great too. They have Mexican cokes, horchata, and a hybiscus  tea that looked great. Good prices, friendly staff, nice clean modern -- perfect for an inexpensive night of dining."}
{"text":"We ordered a burger, it was a strong 4 stars, the week part is the bun. Nothing special.  The price is excellent  under 6.00. The fries are a 6 star. Best fries in AZ.  Great service.  Only a couple tables inside.  Try it you will make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"Being a So. Cal native I like \"street style tacos\". I was a bit iffy on this place at first since it's tucked away. But opted to try it out as i was on a kick of trying new places around my office. I was completely surprised by this place. The short rib tacos are incredibly good as well as the chicken tacos. It's a very relaxed place to eat, nothing fancy on the inside and the patio seating offers a nice breeze. But the tacos are incredibly delicious. I wanted to try their street style corn but it was not in season. They put pickled cabbage on their tacos which was different, not a fan of pickled anything but my coworker thought it was great. Comes with cotija cheese and add the hot sauce with some lime... And it's a great tasting taco and inexpensive lunch. Great place, have eaten there a few times and it had become one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"It was just okay! It's not like it wasn't good it just wasn't that great and it didn't have that \"wow\" factor for me. Seeing how people rave about this place, I thought that I was going to be blown away by an authentic taste, but it was just a basic burger. I was also pretty disappointed in the fries, as they had absolutely no flavor and tasted like they were fried in old oil that hadn't been changed all day, which left a weird after taste.   The burger was decent, it just didn't have that \"mmmm\" flavor factor that I thought it was going to. Maybe my expectations were too high....and it was almost $10 for just a burger and fries with no drink! For that price, I thought I was going to be hooked but I think I'll just stick to In N Out."}
{"text":"THERE'S NO TACOS HERE!! NO STREET CORN EITHER!!  Went to significant effort to get here, apparently they stopped serving tacos and corn in the summer of 2017.  The Scottsdale/Shea location allegedly has them."}
{"text":"Uh, YUM. This place is small and out of the way. I've driven by it a million times and never thought to stop until our friends told us we should go with them to get some burgers.   The first thing I noticed was how clean and modern the inside was. It was nice and cozy. We ordered burgers and fries and a short rib taco with a chocolate shake. The shake was so thick and delicious. The fries are seasoned perfectly and the burger was fantastic. You definitely have to get a cheeseburger...the cheese and special sauce make it. It comes with two thinner patties and I actually like that a lot. Sometimes when the patties are too big it makes for messy eats. I didn't get a bite of the taco since boyfriend ate it but he and our friends who have eaten there before said it was awesome.  The staff is fun and pleasant so we will definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"It's official. As of today, The Stand is my top burger joint in Phoenix.   I stopped here on my first trip out to The Valley, and it's turned into a regular stop ever since I moved here.   The burgers are perfect. They're not too heavy on the meat and not overwhelmed by toppings. There's a perfect balance happening between those buns. A bigger patty or more patties does Not mean a better burger. Someone should put out that memo. I've never had a dry burger here either. They're always tender and juicy.   My verdict is still out on the fries, but I don't come here for the fries so it's kind of a non-issue for me.   The shakes are great. I've had a plain vanilla a couple of times, and hear the dulce de leche is the cow's moo, so I'll be trying that at some point.   If you're feeling Mexicany, the short rib tacos are good. I'm not well versed enough in taco to say how well they stack up against others in the area, but I liked them. The Mexican corn has also been a go-to. Very good.   It's worth mentioning that the people that work here have always been friendly on my visits. At times I've experienced an almost sickening amount of smiley and bubbly here. That's not a bad thing. An aversion to overly happy people is my own cross to bear, and I won't take it out on them.  On the whole, when I think about it, the Stand is my top stop in Phoenix... period."}
{"text":"Meh food. Cheerful employees. Long wait for 4 burgers, fries were cold. If you truly love In and Out Burgers, you'll probably like this place. Very thin fried hamburger patties.  Personally, I like a thick patty that is cooked medium rare. These patties are fried beyond what is necessary. So dry, a couple bites that I swallowed scratched my throat."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great price! Extremely kid friendly which I appreciate. The service was incredible- very friendly people which honestly makes a huge difference when you choose to eat out. The burger was fantastic as well as the fries! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\" then The Stand is definitely a 2 star restaurant. Not only have I had better, but I've had better IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD!   I was very excited for this place to open and overall disappointed with my experience here. They've done an excellent job with the space and it looks really great. But I have real issues with the food that the decor just cannot make up for.   In my 3 visits, we've had each of the tacos, the burgers, the fries, and the milkshake (pretty much everything on the menu). The burger is whatever (is that american cheese?), the fries are good but nothing crazy and the store bought, dried out taco shells that break in half when you fold em is a straight up disaster. Factor in no beer and I will not be coming back here.   Too bad. Being from the neighborhood I'd like to like this place. But as stated, a better burger and a better taco can be found just down the street....."}
{"text":"Burger was great, perfectly seasoned beef, loved the bun as well, fries were great too! This will be our new place for burgers! Clean restaurant and great staff! The cashier recommended things for us and she was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Well, the love is back in their tacos & the drive thru spied is better after rush hour.  Delish, juicy, tons of flavor tacos!  You do not need extra salsa.  They consistently forget to give me napkins on drive thru orders & have mixed up 2 beef 1 chicken for the opposite.  Nonetheless, Short rib tacos are amazing.  4 stars as service (no napkins and incorrect orders) needs improvement."}
{"text":"excellent burgers, hand cut fries and the shredded chicken tacos were awesome! super friendly staff and very clean, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"*********Grease pit********This was my delicious fries from the drive in nice and greasy and soft  i threw them out. My two hamburger rolls were wet with grease i'm sorry this place is off my list . All the other picture s of the food that looks good can't be from this location . they are very inconsistent ."}
{"text":"What is the point of having a drive thru if it takes 45 minutes to get through a line of 5 cars. At this point I don't even care if the food is AMAZING... If I wanted to spend this much time waiting for my food, I would have gone to a sit down restaurant. The girl at the window did apologize for the wait... But even after I paid I waited another five minutes to get my food... The worst drive through experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love this little hut! Niman beef burgers always great. Homemade lemonades a must. Great shakes. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place SOOOO much! The chocolate chile shake is to die for! My standard used to be the chocolate chile shake, fries, stand sauce, and if I was super hungry (yes, I can eat a little bit), a veggie taco. It was all fantastically delicious!   Unfortunately, the past two times that I have gone, the fries have been either burnt or soggy. They don't taste horrible, but they definitely are not the glorious potatoes that they were before.   As for the service, it now takes far longer for me to get my food (or even make an order) than it used to.  All around, I'm almost kind of glad that they went down from 5 stars in my book to 3; it makes my move out of the area much easier to handle."}
{"text":"Really wanted a delicious burger and was happy to see that you were open until 10 tonight. Sadly, i just stopped by only to discover that you were closed.   SAD"}
{"text":"Ok so I stopped in about 6 months ago and got a burger and fries.  There was absolutely nothing about it that made me say I want to come back again.  In fairness, I will be going back again just to make sure I didn't miss something."}
{"text":"Got into line for the drive thru at 1:32. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and one fry. Left with our food 27 minutes later. Got home (right around the corner) to enjoy what I thought was going to be a great burger. The bun was soggy like the tomato had been sitting on it all day. The patties didn't seem hot. The fries weren't cooked all the way through. The shakes were great though. I can't believe it takes so long to make crappy burgers and fries. Not going back."}
{"text":"We had heard about the burger fries and shakes for over a year.  We decided to make the trek and it was great, Fries and special sauce were killer!  Burger was tasty and the banana shake was to die for."}
{"text":"Went to the stand today for lunch with a bunch of our friends -- it was my first experience and all I have to say was \"meh.\"  First of all, this place gets 4 stars because their service was EXCELLENT. Even though it was a busy lunch hour all of the staff was pleasant polite and efficient. They came to wipe down our table before we said anything, and were very prompt to clear away our trays, etc.  My husband and I got two short rib tacos, the chips and guacamole, and a large Horchata.  The only redeeming thing about the Horchata was that you got free refills -- otherwise it had way too much cinnamon and didn't taste like authentic horchata. The tacos were ok -- they are reasonably priced but all I tasted was the spiciness with no depth of flavor from the meat. The guac was standard, nothing to write home about.   Might try this place again when I'm in the mood for a burger but for now, it's not something I'll be craving in the near future."}
{"text":"ummmm YUM  Ok first of all, Salted Dulce de Leche milkshake?!?! HFS this was good - now onto the burgers...  One step up from fast food but still deliciously greasy.  I was fortunate enough to come  here while enduring a less than delightful hangover.  Perfect food, especially with the milkshake.    When you're not in the mood for something gourmet, The Stand is where it's at."}
{"text":"This place may not look like much, located in a rather desolate, non-commercial stretch of the salt-river reservation. But they have off the hook native food that is unbelievably delicious!  Go for the red chili and fry bread; you won't regret it. And have a chat with the owners - they're extremely nice."}
{"text":"This place is the best burger and taco stand in town anywhere no matter what anyone else says or where they're from or what their background. Burgers are awesome tacos are awesome. Service is cool it's a hip place and I can't wait for the new location on Shea to open. It looks like a dump but do t let that fool you cuz it's the best bar none and if you do t go you'll regret it for the rest of your life"}
{"text":"This is a great burger spot. Cheap, quality, tasty, quick, has a drive through, the stand sauce is out of this world. I give it four stars because the French fries are mediocre. It can get busy and take some time and the staff is young and sometimes not the most efficient. But, the food is great. The short rib tacos are fantastic and they have a drink called horchata that is superb.  It's very casual, borderline fast food--but really yummy. I recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"I have seen so much about The Stand on Morning and evening news I had to make my way here ASAP! I opted for drive-thru and wasn't disappointed! I ordered 3 burgers and fries and the wait was just about under 10 minutes, not too shabby. My burger was topped with roasted jalapeño and holy moly they certainly aren't the generic, decorative kind! The real deal jalapeño FYI (appreciate it). My husband compared the burger to In-n-out which I didn't see the comparison besides the secret sauce.. it tasted similar to thousand island. The French fries were crispy, yummy and you really can't eat a burger without fries, amirite?"}
{"text":"Burgers were good. The vibe was cool. Reminded me of a beachside shack or something...  My only gripe were the fries: too soggy for me. Not my preference, but maybe it's yours. Not gona call you out if you like soggy fries, but still, not my thing.  I guess overall this place is a good alternative to in n out? Maybe it's cause Thousand island looks like their go to sauce?  Place is good. Soggy is not my thing. World keeps turning."}
{"text":"free fry Monday ! fries are best in town , burgers bot far behind . lemonade is so refreshing as well . small dining room but a very fun place for a quick meal"}
{"text":"The thing about the stand is that as you wait in the terribly long drive through every time, you realize it would be faster and healthier to go to sprouts and make your own food. It's delicious, but they can apparently only serve one burger every 25 minutes. God forbid you order 2. Happen to be sitting in line as I type. One car had been at the window 30 minutes. I have complained to the owner before."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go and they have some fun items on the menu such as season corn and flavored drinks- however, when the season is off, they are a run of the mill burger place. Very greasy."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I live in So. Cal and make the extra time when visiting AZ to make my way to this gem. My family loves this place and I tell all of our friends about it, even treat them to experience. Juicy delicious burgers and shakes that are amazing. You will want to try everything on the menu, it's that good! The prices are cheap, and yummy!"}
{"text":"I noticed this place while staying in the neighborhood last weekend on holiday. I was going to hit up Sip next door but was intrigued by the Stand and the words \"Burgers and Tacos\" painted on the side. Once I arrived, I realized that they aren't selling tacos or street corn. I ended up getting a standard burger (w/bacon and cheese) and fries along with horchata. All three were some of the best examples I've had in a long time. If you're ever in the mood for a burger, this place is amazing. I added jalapeno to my burger because I'm a sucker for hot peppers and I was stoked to see that they were diced fresh jalapenos. It was fantastic. Because I can taste the fine quality ingredients in everything I tried, I really wish they still had the Mexican food and would highly recommend they bring those items back, anyway they can."}
{"text":"My first time here. Very good burgers. Got the regular with cheese, fries, and tried the horchata, which was really good. Looks like they are no longer serving tacos. Went thru drive-in, which was a little slow, but the food was made to order. Fries crispy and hot, and the dipping sauce was excellent. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"You must stop here if you are in the valley. People come from all over the world to see our beautiful Grand Canyon, but the trip can't be completed without stopping at this hot spot. The bean and cheese popover is delicious! I also tried their red chili burrito...so yuuuuuummy! It is lo located in the middle of the Rez. The times I have gone it was packed, but the service is quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"First this is one of my favorite burger joints in all of Arizona. Make sure you add the bacon and onions and grab the pink lemonade on the side.   If you are in a rush its probably best to skip this place during the lunch rush. This goes double in the summer as the indoor seating is limited and the lines are always long from 11-1PM during the week.  I have also tried the taco's which were OK, if you are coming here its probably for the hamburgers."}
{"text":"I was mad when I wrote my first review.. Burgers are really good, especially if you add bacon and guacamole. Fries I would compare to In&out, fresh cut. I personally like crispy.. But still a go to place for an awesome burger!"}
{"text":"Nothing like waiting forever only to get home and find out you've been served raw French fries. I'm happy to wait a little longer for quality food. This is just frustrating and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Husband and I were craving tacos and stopped by our little neighborhood joint The Stand to find out they stopped serving tacos - burgers only. So sad, if I wanted a burger there is a ton of options nearby. Hope they bring tacos back soon."}
{"text":"Best shakes ever! Get the Banana Stand. You will not regret it. The fries are delicious as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are in Phoenix for the first time and decided to grab lunch at The Stand - Arcadia. We both got the standard burger with fries and the salted dulce de leche shake AND WOW - it really surpassed our expectations! Not only was the price super reasonable for the portion size, but the food was absolutely delicious and the staff was extremely friendly and fast. We will definitely be coming back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"The building has stand the test of time longer than any business in it's place.  The Stand is the newest food business in this location. Decent.  I ordered a burger and chips w/guac.  The chips were ok, the amount of guac you receive is pretty much a tablespoon.  The burger was similar to what I've had at other burger joints, nothing really stood out.   If The Stand does stand longer than 6 months, than a lot of promotions and superior customer service will be needed to out shine other burger joints."}
{"text":"This place is straight fire. The spicy shake was awesome and the burger was to die for. It's worth your 15 minute drive home Deborah. #treatyoself"}
{"text":"Generally, very tasty with a few missteps. I ordered their double burger with cheese and it was very tasty, although a bit soggy with all the sauce they put on. Still, pretty good value and definite step up from your basic burgers. I also ordered a short rib taco. Really, really good! Tender beef, cabbage and onions. Very nice. Chips and salsa was good, though the chips were very, very salty. Only real complaint was drive thru girl was outta sync and kept talking over me and then really, long pauses. Otherwise, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great late-night food. Chert rib taco is excellent. The salted milkshake is also excellent. Love the big straw."}
{"text":"I hate to do this cause I really wanted to like the Stand, and I'm probably going to be one of the few to say, it was just okay.  Street tacos - $2.99 each. We got the short rib tacos and they were tasty (or too sweet, my hubby says) but soo tiny. I'd like more but for $2.99 a piece, not so much. If it were $0.50-$1 cheaper, I'd be all over it, but not for $2.99, sorry.  The Standard is their burger which is a double patty burger with the usual onions, lettuce, and tomatoes for $5.49. For $0.50, you can add cheese. For $1.59, bacon, and for $0.79, caramelized onions. Again, for that price, I'm really hesitant to add everything on it but it'd be so plain otherwise. So fine, take my money. This better be good. But it was okay. Too much bread for me, with just a little bit of bacon - which didn't appear to be thick cut bacon as the menu stated, and a lot of vegetable.  Price aside, it bugged me some that the food wasn't piping hot. Like some ingredients were somewhat hot but when most of the other items are at room temperature, it kinda takes away from the piping hot meal I was hoping for.  I'd still say give it a go since there were tons of people going for take out, but I guess my expectations were a little high so don't make that mistake."}
{"text":"If I'd stumbled over this burger stand, which appears to have crossed the temporal barrier from a 1960s where Phoenix was much more sophisticated, on my own, I'd be having a five-star rave over how it's the most amazing thing ever.  Having had it recommended as the most amazing thing ever by a foodie web site, I'm feeling distinctly three-star-ish. So split the difference, as the place is well-intentioned in a flustered way, and neighborhoods need good hamburger joints.  Certainly, it was the best-smelling burger in recent memory. You get two thin, seared patties that are most definitely well-done. Any juiciness comes from the Russian dressing, the tomato, and really first-rate pickles. The fries were workmanlike, if lukewarm. When twilight falls and the Muzak plays Pink Floyd, you will eat the fries anyway.  Y'know... same price as fast food, hipster ambience... I'd eat here again simply because you don't find yourself soaked in grease and self-loathing at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"The prices are high, otherwise I would give them five stars. The food is great. Especially the street corn, burgers, salted caramel shake, and chips and salsa/guacamole (but the salsa - that you pay for - comes in one very small little cup).  The tacos are just alright to me, but everything else I've had is really good."}
{"text":"They are old fashion burgers that actually have alot of flavor and fresh ingredients. They are actually doing what a big chain that tries to get you \"in and out\" claims to do in that nothing is frozen and everything is fresh. Only they do it much better. All the ingredients are fresh daily and the burger is hand crafted to order. Honestly it is one of the best burgers I think I have ever had and I think everyone should give it a shot. We also got their fries which were wonderful and their Mexican corn which I am having a craving for right now. I also have had their shakes previously and can't say enough good things about them either. As if the food wasn't enough, the entire staff was friendly and helpful! We will be back and I hope anyone reading this will give them a shot!"}
{"text":"We were 20 min. early this morning in anticipation of a great Burger and fries, But me and the family were very disappointed as the Fries we ordered looked like the were re-fried from the night before and was from the bottom of the bag as they were a lot of small pieces ,they had a very bad after taste that I still have as I am writing this review. the Burgers were nothing  special. I have had better burgers at Carl's Jr. The Best part of the meal was the Bottled Coca-Cola. The Family will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Hands down 100 percent best burger in Arizona. I eat here once a month. Super tiny spot, if you are going to eat in, better to hit them up during an off peak time for lunch/dinner and don't even think about getting a seat on a Saturday. Fries are awesome, shakes are awesome. Other than the oafy white cook in the back I get the impression that most of the folks who work there are related somehow. Family owned feel. You won't regret the wait after you taste the food."}
{"text":"This was shown on Fox 10 this morning as the \"best burger in Phoenix\" and we thought we'd try it. Way over-rated!  Granted they talked about the one in Scottsdale, but it's the same menu and owners. It was an average burger. Shake shack makes a far superior burger with a great bun. It was an okay burger, but certainly nothing special and nothing that would make drive to get it a second time."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of people complaining about flavor stating food doesn't had enough seasoning . We love in society where everybody is used eating fake fast food with a lot of artificial flavoring. Well , we loved this place . It's a tiny burger restaurant with amazing food. Little pricey ? Yes it's not McDonalds , you pay for what you get. We had short rib tacos and burgers with bacon plus fries. Add tall drink and it's $30 for two, price was very worth the quality , we ll be back !"}
{"text":"Bookmark day  In the area and wanted to try some place new  The Stand was a joint that we had passed several times  Upon walking in, it is small and I felt like it had almost a \"beach\" feel... The inside is very nice and clean...  All of the workers seemed to be high school/college kids which I thought was pretty cool...  The menu is small but hey, it works I got the cheeseburger, fries, and a coke I enjoyed the burger The fries were pretty okay too The coke was good  The service was good  Next time I will try the tacos, a lot of people got those while we were in...   The look yumzo..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now and I've come to the conclusion that while the burger is good and the fries are great I'd rather go In n Out. The Stand burger is a classic American cheeseburger, and it's done well, but is that enough? Within a couple of miles of the stand there are some great options for burgers, and while the price is good and the service is good I feel like The Stand is missing something. Maybe it's because the bun was a little stale on all three of our burgers today. It made eating the burger a \"meh\" experience. Everything else was fine. The burger is cooked and seasoned well, the shakes are delicious and the fries and so so good. But when you have such a small menu and you serve burgers with dry buns it kind of weakens the experience for me.  It's a cool place, so I'll be back - I'll just stop by In N Out in the meantime to clean my palate.   3.5/5"}
{"text":"Nice local burger joint.   Simple menu and pretty plain decor but that's fine with me. The focus is obviously on the food as it should be with a small place like this. In a city with a chain on every corner The Stand sets itself apart with its French Fries. These are French Fries not soggy, greasy fresh cut fries like 5 guys.  Most likely soaked in water for hours to remove the starch and double cooked to make them crispy. Dare I say they are using Kennebec Potatoes?   My mother had the burger and I ordered the tacos. The burger looked like a In N Out/ Shake Shack hybrid and she said it was fantastic. The tacos were ok, next time I'll order a burger and likely add the last star. It's priced right and the service was EXCELLENT, great friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Burgers are basically slightly better but smaller versions of 5 Guys. Which isn't a bad thing. They're great. The fries are either inconsistent, or I've gotten lucky/unlucky one of the 2 times I've been here. Today they were amazing, and last time they were so-so. The shakes are also really good.   The menu in the pictures is very outdated. $6 for a cheeseburger, $3 for fries, and $5 for a shake."}
{"text":"The burger tastes pretty good, if a little bland, adding jalapenos is something soggy and stringy, not crisp. The tacos are good but have too much of something, I think vinegar on the purple adds. The fries .. they're fries. Potato. Not amazing, but, legit. The best part of my meal, and I've been here two or three times, is the banana shake. Delicious.  But I have to take a star away from what would have been a four star experience because this place is too expensive. If you get a loaded burger, fries, a taco, a tiny little tub of their sauce, and a shake, expect to pay well over $20. Yikes! And I thought Carl's Jr. was bad on the price. My meal was good but worth maybe a little bit over half of what I pay at The Stand."}
{"text":"It was alright. The chocolate shake was pretty good. The burger was average tasting, but you can tell that the ingredients are very fresh. The staff were nice and everything. It just didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"My cheat meal, go-to place. Banana shake, fries and the standard with cheese. Nap necessary afterwards. Tip: sit outside if you don't want your hair to smell like French fry grease afterwards...unless you're into that sorta thing"}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure: Standard double-patty with cheese and roasted jalapeños, side of fries with two 'stand sauces' and a banana stand milkshake. Never disappointed by this place. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really delish ., super casual joint..  Try the standard hamburger loaded up with lettuce, tomatoe, pickle, onion and the homemade stand sauce..   The short rib taco .. Served on double corn tortilla with pickled red cabbage and cotiga cheese .. Hot sauce on the side was on point!! Must try ..   Casual burger place full of surprises .,   Next time I'm having the Mexican street corn"}
{"text":"Recently The Stand stopped selling a lot of there menu... but the main reason I will not go back is due to the price of the horchata... now there selling a 24oz cup for $2.89 when before they were selling a way bigger cup for the same price... this is very dissapointing as the only reason I went to The Stand was for the Horchata which then made me decide to buy there hamburger and fries which for the size of the food is not worth $5+ and fries $2+... very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going...  UXA"}
{"text":"The burgers were very good, very juicy and tasted great. Would have liked to have the French fries a little more crispy."}
{"text":"The owner has gone whackadoodle!  I live around the corner and decided I wanted to order a burger to go.  I called in my order, so I could avoid the really, really long wait at the drive thru.  I was informed they now have a $50 minimum for phone orders....outrageous!  When I asked why, they said because too many people place orders then don't show up.  (They probably did but got tired of waiting in the drive thru and left.)  I find it hard to believe they would prefer to get burned on a $50 order vs a $6 order....just doesn't make sense.   I then asked how backed up the drive thru is, was informed there were 4 cars which usually means a 30-45 minute wait.   Fagettaboutit!  I'll order a gyro from Mr Z instead"}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, and most importantly, tasty!  My burger was huge and messy, with added real, thick bacon, and spicy grilled jalapeños.  I shared an order of fries with my sister, and it was plenty for the both of us. And judging by the amount of time it took her to eat her burger and suck down her milkshake through her giant boba-sized straw, she enjoyed her meal as much as I did!  They may be a little more expensive than their counterparts, but the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"So I like the stand, or at least used to.  Come just for a standard burger, fries, and a shake.  Shake machine is broken.  Ok, things happen.  It is now 25 minutes later, and my food finally got here after I had to make a scene.  All I can say is keep your reciept for when they forget you.... Or better yet head to ingos, or anywhere else really"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend and wow was it ever delicious. The peach lemonade was absolutely delicious. The burgers were awesome. Seriously one of the best it's a double burger we added cheese and bacon and it comes with lettuce onion and tomato. Now the fries! Oh my they are great with skin on, they have a salty and slightly spicy thing going on. I will come again even if I have to drive across town to get here"}
{"text":"Salty salty salty!!! Don't get me wrong I love salt, but I couldn't even eat my burger it was way too much. Maybe I got a bad batch, but if that's the norm I would stay away."}
{"text":"I really just come here for the chocolate chile shake.  That will come as no surprise to my yelp friends, as my affinity for oddly flavored frozen dairy based treats is well documented in the talk threads.  This shake comes as any  well made shake should.  With a gigantic straw.  This is the fattest straw I've ever seen.  Even with this colossal drinking implement you will sooner pop a blood vessel than get any of the sweet elixir to travel though it.   Nope, you gotta pop that lid off and spoon it into your mouth until it melts a little. It's that thick.  Just the way god intended a milk shake to be.  Then theres the chewy chunks of chile that assault your taste buds with a little kick of spice that accompanies the sweet chocolate goodness so beautifully.  Seriously.  Why is any chocolate shake EVER served without chile.  They belong together, in my mouth."}
{"text":"Yep.  The Stand has begun it's downhill slide into mediocrity, joining other popular hip Arcadia hangouts.  Did the drive through last night. Essentially, the only thing left on the menu is burger and fries.  And that wasn't very impressive.  The fries were soggy and tiny, like they collected all the little scraps of fries from the bottom of the bag, cooked them until they were just limp enough, then tossed them in our bag.  Stand Sauce?  What is that?  The Stand burger was just okay.  Honestly, for the price, InAndOut is far superior in both burger and fries.  I know.  The Stand in Arcadia once stood tall, and business was booming.  So much so they opened another location in Scottsdale.  I guess that is where all the attention goes now.  Buh-bye, The Stand.  It was nice while you lasted."}
{"text":"The burgers were absolutely wonderful. The service was fast. The menu is simple and doesn't have much variety. However, they don't need a lot of variety. We had the burger and pork tacos. You need to also try their drinks. The strawberry lemonade was wonderful but tart. The vanilla milkshake was good too. Everyone was coming in and getting the salted caramel shake. I wish I had tried it. I must try if traveling through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have never had a burger taste so good ! From the spicy jalapeños to the grilled unions, these burgers are perfect! Let me also say that their horchata is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! They make better horchata than i do! Lol i really love this place because of the food but also because of the people who work here. So nice and always a smile on everyones faces. The place is super cool and relaxing, theres a little patio where you can sit too. I love it! Just wish there was a location also in west Phoenix! But its definitely worth the ride !"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that has a drive-thru, this place has a good burger.  The fries weren't that great and I actually thought the chocolate milk shake was just average.  I would recommend this place for someone that wants a good burger and is wanting something more local and better than a chain burger joint."}
{"text":"I think my expectations of the food were set too high. Don't get me wrong, the burger was pretty damn good. Got it with everything: cheese, grilled onions, bacon & jalepeños. The last two are what made it great. Thick bacon & roasted, peeled jalapeño that was actually HOT (not for noobs). Fries were ok. The choco-chile shake was, well, a chocolate shake with powdered chile in it. I guess an extra dollars worth. It was good but no help against the jalepeño. Luckily the waitress(?) was nice enough to refill my soda many times. Did I mention the service? Very good, especially for a counter type setup. She even exchanged my hot salsa for mild after I tasted cumin in it (oh how I hate cumin, it kills the flavor of everything it touches). The mild was excellent, tomatoes, cilantro & chunks of garlic. If they put the jalapeños in it it would make a stellar hot salsa. As for the short rib taco, disappointing. The meat was ok. No better than a barbacoa taco anywhere else. The pickled cabbage is a little off making the taco taste, as my daughter put it, \"like taking a bite of cologne\". And the dry, store bought tortilla crumbled making a mess. For $3 a taco it should be fresh-made. All in all it was \"ok\". I'd come back for the burger or maybe the fresh squeezed lemonade but that's it."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best burger in town and to top it off they have hand spun milkshakes. Stopped in a week ago and a man who appeared to be definitely a manger and possibly the owner was in the store. He was helping out, delivering food and chatting with the employees and guests. The ladies behind the counter are always bubbly and smiling. Went again this week and had another great visit. Love this place, their employees and their food."}
{"text":"After my friend Zak helped me with a ride from the airport I offered him a meal to pay him back. Which is how we ended up at The Stand. After pondering whether to get a burger or Mexican I decided to get the cheeseburger with grilled onions and fries.  The fries were pretty great and are a step or two above your In N Out style fries. The burger on the other hand was a bit of a letdown. It was strange because it looked like a great burger and had all the elements needed to be amazing but in the end..... the taste kinda fell flat.   + Toasted Bun + Lotta Juice  - Sauce didn't really add anything  - Burger became a heavy tasting slog towards the finish line  What was more interesting to me then the food was the interior and the bright blue walls of this place. Cool interior and concept that echoes the Echo Park area in LA but sadly the food execution wasn't there. It's the food that lumps it into the likes of 5 Guys, Smashburger, and The Habit of good - not great burger places.  Don't get me wrong eating here wasn't a bad experience; it just wasn't an exceptional one. (But come for the blue walls!)"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try, but unfortunately did not get a chance to partake. After waiting for 15 minutes in the drive-thru line that never moved (literally) I decided to call a spade a spade and left. At other \"upscale\" drive-thrus (see D'lish), if their drive-thru line is long, a staff member comes out to your car to take and/or deliver your order. The Stand could learn a thing or two about improving their customer service."}
{"text":"First time to The Stand. Wonderful burgers and shakes. Chocolate Chili shake was amazing. Friendly staff, great customer service.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Clean, friendly and fast. Tacos are amazing I recommend the short rib. Burgers are good too. Yummy horchata and lemonades. You have to try dulce de leche shake will blow your mind !"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. It is small and easy to order and take out. Of course, if you want to dine in, there is enough room, both on the patio and inside...just not for big crowds.   They have gluten free everything and the food is delicious! I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun for myself and a regular burger for my sister. We had fries and chocolate shake as well, which complimented everything so well.   I love finding gems like this place. Stop in if you are craving a delicious burger and fries."}
{"text":"I had to update my review.  This place is fresh, local, and makes a solid burger.  I love their drivethru, and I don't even mind that it's little $$ for the extras because the food is such great quality and they use local ingredients.  Simple, tasty, and consistent."}
{"text":"I pass by The Stand a couple times a week, but the missus isn't a big fan of burgers so I normally have to suffer a burgerless meal when we're out and about. I know, it's pretty terrible. Today I'm off work and flying solo, I finally take my chance and wander in. I'm so very glad I did.  I was immediately greeted by the friendly girl behind the counter, and she took my order deftly. I was pleasantly surprised to find my food ready mere minutes after ordering, and my special-ordered burger (no sauce, tomatoes, pickles; add bacon and onions) was exactly right. The patties were cooked well but still juicy, the lettuce was fresh, and the onions were perfectly grilled. The strawberry lemonade was tasty and just the right amount of tart, but I do feel like they added way to much ice to my cup before pouring. The fries looked a tiny bit underdone, but were still tasty and delicious. I asked for a couple sides of their hot salsa for the fries, it was exactly the right combo.   I'll be back, and I'll even try to sway the missus with promises of what I'm hoping are tacos just as tasty as the burger I ate today. Hooray for another awesome small business successfully making my tummy happy!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever, great besides an overstuffed basket of fries. Don't miss this small but delicious burger stop."}
{"text":"To start I'm not the biggest burger fan but have been trying new burgers across Phoenix. The stand had a great atmosphere and fun local vibe. The service was pretty slow but the staff was all young and trying their best. The burger was average to me but the shake was amazing!! I like a really simple burger and would pick in n out over pretty much every burger in AZ."}
{"text":"The Stand holds a special spot in my heart before I even tried their food since this is the old location of Maui Dogs, and that's where I had my first date with the hubbs. That's what made it even more satisfying to find that the food didn't disappoint! I got the standard double patty cheeseburger with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno plus a side of fries and a salted dulce de leche shake. I enjoyed all of it. The other reviews on Yelp hit the nail on the head when they describe it as a sort of pseudo-in-n-out. I would say they are pretty similar in many ways but I'd also say they have some key differences. I can only commit to saying I like both in different ways. The jalapeno and grilled onions are a must when ordering a burger here, I like anything and everything spicy so the fact that they spread the whole jalapeno out on the burger (with the seeds) instead of little slices from a jar made a world of difference and gave it a glorious kick. The fries were my cup-o-tea, similar to in-n-out. My man thinks they were a little soggy for his taste but I thought they were just as soggy at in-n-out and I devoured them. The shake was AMAZEBALLS but I definitely think I might have gone into diabetic shock after sharing one with Eric. The staff was really nice, but really slow. We waited for half an hour for our food and when we finally got it we asked if it would've been faster to go through the drive thru and they gave an honest answer (which I admire)-- they're just slow. lol Can't hate on the truth! They are fairly new so I bet they will speed up the service with more experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING BURGERS! And gluten free buns! We added bacon and jalapeños to our burger and it was the incredibly delicious! My husband had their Horchata shake and was extremely impressed! The service was excellent! Everyone there greets you with a smile and truly make you feel welcomed! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Burgers were juicy with crisp fresh veggies. Bun (potato?) was great as well. But the real MVP here is the chocolate chile shake. Same price as a burger, but worth it."}
{"text":"Place was very modernized. Burger was great and a great price. Comparable to In and Out burger. However, I personally liked the burger better than In and Out. The hand cut fries were good. Milkshakes sounded awesome on the menu but I did not have enough appetite after I ate the burger, very filling. Would definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking for a quick burger for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to grab a burger and fries in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area.  I get my burger with cheese, onions and tomatoes - each ingredient is fresh and compliments the two beef patties perfectly.  I also get a side of fries and a lemonade - about the same price point as some other burger chains and much tastier IMHO.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered and got my food within 5 minutes. I don't understand what everyone else complains about waiting.   I had the pork tacos. Bomb. So many flavorsss.   I also had the much recommended salt caramel shake. It's definitely good but definitely overhyped. Maybe it was because I did a full day of hiking and was used to bland food. Or maybe that shake is diabetes.   I didn't try the burgers because it seemed too heavy for my tummy at the moment, but I definitely need to!"}
{"text":"As others have stated, its like in and out but more expensive. I also think the meat is better just because of the cuts they ground up together. But I got a mexican coke and a standard with cheese for like 8 bucks? Lil expensive, especially without fries. not saying it isnt worth it, delicious it was. I just wouldnt make a habit out of it..."}
{"text":"The burger was alright, but only because of the meat. I had the standard plus cheese. The bun wasn't great and I'm not sure if it was just the bun was dry or stale or what, but something was off. The fries looked good, but they were uncooked when I bit into them and hardly had any seasoning. I was really excited to try this place out and I was quite a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Az !!!  .. A little dis-organized.... And had to wait in line for a while ...  Orders got mixed up .... But all's well that ends well. .. Patience pays off ...Awesome Burger !!!! Will be back soon !!!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and fries but they ration the ketchup!"}
{"text":"Summer is here so make sure you get that Mexican Street Corn as it's the season!!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit AF!! I was driving down Alma School on the Rez and all I saw was a neon sign that said \"Open\" and I knew that meant food...so I turned in and ordered a fry bread! Omg...it was so good. I haven't had fry bread in a couple months. Had to get my fix, I never knew this was here but I will definitely be coming here as often as I can and bring all my friends and fam. I mean how much more legit can you get than this."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here with a couple of friends, and it was more different than I thought it was going to be. The place itself is quite small, it's a order at the register and pick up your own food type of deal, unless they aren't busy they will bring the food to you. We got the standard burger with grilled onions. The burger was quite tasty, the standard actually comes with two patties, cheese and the regular fixings. We also ordered the fries to share. I was disappointed as the fries tasted like they had given us leftover fries from a few hours ago. They were cold, soggy, and some were super crunchy. The girl working at the register wasn't friendly either, she didn't like to answer the questions we had since it was our first time. Overall this experience wasn't outstanding."}
{"text":"Not mexican food. Not mexican food.. the elote fail. The tacos fail.. only if you want a really expencive burger go to this place."}
{"text":"I like a cheeseburger and fries pretty much more than anything else in the world. This place is OK, nothing thrilling about it, and a little expensive for what it is--a drive-thru cheeseburger and fries. Yes, it is a step above Burger King and the like, but I didn't think it was worth the long wait in line for the extra price.   However, I did have a banana shake and it was great and I would drive thru for that again to be sure. But otherwise, meh..."}
{"text":"By the looks of the outside of The Stand, it's not very warming, at first glance. To me, it looked a bit run-down and I worried that the food would reflect my initial thoughts. Upon entering though, it was quite clean and welcoming! However, the place is ridiculously tiny, so the line was literally wrapping around the very limited places to sit. My friends and I arrived there around 11:40 and didn't get our order taken until after 12. We stood in line for over 20 minutes. I understand that it was lunch time on a weekday but what's the holdup with at least taking the order quickly so people don't have to awkwardly stand around. When I finally got up to the front to place my order, the cashier said \"one moment\" and then turned around and proceeded to package up a to-go order. She didn't turn around or acknowledge me for a good 5 or 10 minutes and just continued helping another customer. There were so many employees back there working on that one order. It all seemed quite chaotic. How about one person takes orders while another fills them?  Anyway, the food got to our table pretty quickly, which slightly made up for the awfully long wait. I got the chicken tacos and they were super messy with sauce. They tasted kind of plain though. Nothing spectacular. My friends both got burgers which looked pretty amazing so maybe that's where the specialty is.  All in all, I probably won't be going back unless it's for takeout."}
{"text":"From the outside The Stand may appear to be a dive yet it's a hidden gem in the Arcadia area!  Since In-n-Out's leadership changed their burgers are smaller and less appealing, after trying The Stand food I won't be an In-n-Out customer going forward.  The Stand is a must try for a remarkable priced burger with crunchy seasoned fries and a yummy shake!  The shake cost may seem high for the portion but it's too yummy to pass up the \"Salted Dulce de Leche\" shake!  If you dine in seating is limited and the A/C is just right in this AZ heat!  The friendly customer service and speed of what is delivered was impressive considering the massive line at the drive-tru.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly staff, excellent service and awesome food.    I am new to the area and I live just off Indian school and 40th so I was looking for some quick yet tasty food and I came across the stand! The fries were seasoned just right. I got a burger with cheese, jalapeños and bacon and it was more than satisfying. The jalapeños were really hot... but I like that! I also got a banana shake and it was just phenomenal. I will be coming here as much as I can."}
{"text":"I was in town for 3 days and are here twice. It was awesome! Best seasoned French fries! The burger was amazing too! It's a small location (not even sure they have a sit down area. I would recommend this place several times over!"}
{"text":"Just came here for a post workout meal and it was delicious. I had a burger which was amazing. It was the classic burger without all the extra grease. My husband tried all 3 tacos (and so did I) and we liked all of them. Everyone around us was getting shakes and I was jealous. Next time I will be getting one!!  Super friendly staff too :)"}
{"text":"Much to my chagrin the wife wanted their tacos again. Went inside. Ordered. Then almost slipped a disk when I stumbled on the greasy floor. Asked the server to mop. She ignored me. Hailed the manager and asked him to mop and explained the floor was extremely greasy. Ignored. If your front lobby floor is THAT DIRTY, how does the kitchen look???????"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I eat there all the time! The milkshakes are the bomb! And the server named Jake is so awesome!! I love this place"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about the burger, fries or sauce. Doesn't compare to even In & Out yet alone more upscale better burger joints. Do urself a favor and drive to Hopdoddy Burgers on Camelback and 24th or Rehab Burger Therapy in Scottsdale or even better go to ShakeShack. The Shakeshack burger  is the burger I was expecting here at the Stand after reading all the great reviews."}
{"text":"We went for a cheeseburger and to try the Taco's! The cheeseburger was obviously frozen or was just too old. When we pulled the bread off the burger it crumbled like pie crust. Added Caramelized onions (actually sweated onions) then roasted jalapeño peppers (just canned peppers). The burger was 2 out of 5 stars! Then we go to the the Short Rib Taco's!!! Wow what a disappointment!!!!!!!! The marinade was extremely odd to me! Tasted cinnamon and nutmeg in the meat which totally was not appetizing to me. The corn tortilla was cold and flavorless. Pickled onions weren't pickled long enough at all. Then we have the salsa!!!! Two different salsa's they gave us. First One blended and was lacking flavor all together. Second one.... Well it was chunky and in my opinion it was bottled! Tasted like Pace Picante to me! Absolutely a disappointment!!!! We will never go back! Service was good though!"}
{"text":"been wanting to try this out for a while and finally got my chance....I went for the burger...was not impressed  I think the patty was a bit to lean for my taste  and did have 'different' flavor probably from the rib meat Im guessing but it came off a bit 'exotic' for my taste and what I look for in a burger....the bun however is a nice egg bun I think is a bit 'dense' for the size of patties they serve and although I prefer thin patties I like to see them with a less dense bun.  Sauce was good but not a fan of 'leaf' lettuce on a burger....shredded Iceberg to me is the best way to go.  did not try the frys but was intrigued by the tacos so I tried their  short rib taco, its was nice  different  salsa was good and fresh.....if I went again  it would only be for the tacos, 'if' I went  Im on the other side of the valley doubtful it would be worth a second trip."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered burgers with my fiancé and my sister. I was very curious to see what this place Has to offer since it's so close to my house. Once we got our food I went up and asked for sauce for my burger and she gave me two packets. I returned to my seat and we were eating our burgers and halfway as we were finished the employee comes to our table tells us that the sauces are not free that there is a charge for them !!! I can't believe this place had the nerve to come in and interrupt us during our meal for something so minor it's so dumb!!! Either looked at her and said are you serious? I asked are you really going to charge us we were pretty much almost done with their meal? She said yes I have to. I gave her my credit card and she went to charge it. Worst experience I've ever had at a fast food chain with payment. Most ridiculous thing I've ever had to experience. Also the most unprofessional burger chain I've ever ordered from. Will not be coming here due to the unprofessional customer service"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. It's like they took the best parts of in-n-out (friendly staff and great hamburgers) and added amazing tacos to the menu. The short rib tacos are what we came for and they didn't let down. I had a chicken one as well and it was also delicious.  The dulce-de-leche shake may be the best milkshake I've EVER had. We will be going back regularly. Also , the manager and staff that was on when we came on Saturday night was incredible, great service!"}
{"text":"Super bummed. Ordered red chili and carton eas marked red chili but got all the eay home to discover it was regular hamburger. It was ok but not as good as their red chili."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for beef tacos, and a flavorful patty. The burger has a great presentation will served even inside the bag, the owner takes pride is presentation when serving awesome grub food"}
{"text":"Once again we brought family in from Los Angeles and they went crazy for the Stand Burgers and Short rib Tacos!   We washed it down with the chocolate chili shakes!"}
{"text":"Visited The Stand for the first time with a friend today. If you're looking for someplace that makes you feel welcome and serves great old fashion style burgers and fries... this is the place!! Go try it next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't regret it, I promise."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! Beats In n Out by far. Wait was less than 10 min not sure what people seem to be fussing about. You have to get the fries with the stand sauce. Fries are so good and are seasoned with garlic salt! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some burgers and fries for our Friday evening out but decided to try something different from our usual burger joints.  Location & Aesthetics - located on East Indian School Road in Phoenix.  The restaurant cannot be missed with its bright blue colored exterior, and large sign 'The Stand' (no relation to Stephen King's novel). There is a drive through option.    Parking was available on the side and rear of the restaurant but in my opinion not adequate for large crowds.  If dining in, the restaurant had minimal seating inside; there is some seating available under their covered patio which offered lots of privacy from the peering eyes of motorists from East Indian School Road.   For the minimal parking and dine-in seating (-1).  The outside seating was comfortable with music playing and a large dehumidifier to keep patrons cool (no misters).  I'm guessing it might be a bit difficult to eat out on the patio during the middle of the summer months.  Menus - clearly displayed over the cashier, simple, and easy to read.  They offer one burger with and without cheese; stand-ins which I didn't try; tacos and sides, and drinks. The offer a variety of drinks including horchata and a drink called a \"Jamaica\" which tastes like sorrel (a drink known in the Caribbean) but upon further research I discovered it's Hibiscus Iced Tea (hope I'm not wrong on that). Staff offered us samples of both to try.   Service - Staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately as we entered and asked if we were dining in and took our names.  They answered any questions we had about the menu and drinks.  Food - For me I ordered the Standard burger (2 House-Ground All Beef Patty, Crisp Leafed Lettuce, Fresh Tomato, Sliced Onion, Dill Pickle, and Stand Sauce) without the cheese, a chicken taco and a side of fries with the \"Jamaica\" drink. Despite the burger not oozing with juices and had a dry look to it, it was supremely tasty!  The burger itself was well seasoned and fresh along with the ingredients like the lettuce, tomato, onions (not overpowering), and the dill pickle.  I couldn't really tell whether the Stand sauce was in there or not but, if it was, it didn't deter from the taste of the burger.  The burger wasn't greasy, messy, or full of oils.   The fries was fresh cut, well seasoned with the right amount of salt and again wasn't oily or greasy. The chicken taco (Warm Corn Tortillas, Tender Roast Chicken, Pickled Red Onion, Cotija Queso Fresco, Fresh Cilantro) was also extremely tasty and my only regret was not ordering more, and even if I did, the wifesky would've put the kibosh on that one!  All of its ingredients were fresh, well seasoned, and served hot.  Even the tender roasted chicken tasted as if it was just made. The entire meal wen down easy and most importantly I didn't have that, \"I feel overly stuffed,\" feeling post-prandial.  Despite it being a little out of the way from where I live, I'd still very much love to visit here again as I thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, tacos, and the exotic 'Jamaica' drink!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Phoenix! I would say in and out and 5 guys and fries  perfectly blended together = The Stand. Must try!"}
{"text":"Imma say this one thing and then I'm gone, the milkshakes here are so good I didn't even care that I'm lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"I love the milkshakes here. I've tried almost all of them, got one more to try!  The burger and fries were good... reminded me of In-n-Out (which is a good thing for me).  Another time tried the tacos and it didn't mesh with my palate, I thought they were too sweet.  But I will be back for burgers and fries and of course the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers so much I'd marry them. It'd be a plural marriage, too, because while one is enough to satisfy, it leaves you wanting more. You finish your meal and you plan your next visit to The Stand as you're wiping the corners of your mouth and smiling. There's one more tiny crispy fry in the basket- don't leave it there all alone!  To me, the burgers taste like a lot like In N Out at the basic level of meat and bun but there's another level of flavor to them and I don't know if it's from the quality of meat itself or from how it's cooked. It's not a thick half pound patty of ground beef, it's a thin pair of patties grilled on a flat iron and they have a delicious crust on each side imparting all kinds of ridiculous flavor.   I've brought friends from out of town here and they couldn't believe how incredible the burgers and fries are and were saddened to learn that it's not a franchise that could show up in DC or NYC for their dining pleasure.  Mexican Coke on ice with a burger and fries at The Stand is bomb."}
{"text":"While in the neighborhood I finally decided it would be a great time to try this place. I went through the drive thru.   I wasn't feeling a burger so I ordered one chicken taco and one short rib. I also got fries on the side and a small horchata. The best thing about the meal was the fries and horchata! The tacos were OK. I probably wouldn't order them again. I do have to mention though, that they were generously filled with meat which is great and they double the tortilla. So if you like them they're worth it! I guess I'm just super picky about tacos!   Beside the food I ordered, I also knocked down a star because I was super looking forward to getting a street corn. That is my absolute fave and for a restaurant near me to offer that literally would've made my life! But to my disappointment they were all out :(   I do love that they have a drive thru so I'll be back to get a corn, and maybe to try their burgers. I'll update my review if so! :)"}
{"text":"Chocolate milkshakes are delicious.  They have a huge straw, makes it very easy to eat. Burgers were also delicious and the frys, everything is good"}
{"text":"Super-disappointed that tacos were removed from the menu and that there are no healthy/vegan options anymore. I won't be returning for a long time."}
{"text":"It's good but greasy burgers, but great vegetarian tacos and shakes! My Hubby likes the chocolate and I like the vanilla dolce! This is not a place to try on your lunch break, again slow kitchen, I think because it is made as it is ordered which is great quality but it is a more expensive version of in and out burger. Fun weekday night joint."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the standard burger with bacon, side of fries and a vanilla shake. They did a mini burger for my daughter which was perfect, only one patty with cheese. Everything was delicious, including the classic lemonade! The fries were slightly on the crunchy side but still delicious. The burger was pure perfection. I will no doubt be craving this deliciousness in the next few weeks."}
{"text":"Great food but some of the worst service I have ever experienced. They served 3 customers before me that showed up 5 minutes after I had already ordered. When I asked why my food was taking so long they said they were waiting on fries, but somehow everyone else that got their food had fries with their order. I had them just give me my food without fries because my burger and taco had been sitting there for 10 minutes while they waited on fries. Waiting 20 minutes for a burger, fries and a taco is pretty ridiculous. Might try it one more time. Otherwise I'll just go to in-n-out burger and get close to the same thing for cheaper and quicker."}
{"text":"The Stand is simply incredible. As others have mentioned, it's much better than it looks from the outside.  As for food, their burgers are top notch quality--they're nearly every bit as good as you could get from a restaurant like Red Robin or Delux for half the price. In fact, the hamburger patty itself is more moist and delicious than those from most pricier places. I've never tried their shakes, but I've heard nothing but good reviews from others. Their peach lemonade (seasonal) was incredible and perfectly balanced, and their short rib tacos were superb (they were better than the short rib tacos from Chelsea's Kitchen). The only thing I'm not a fan of is their fries. They're very similar to In-N-Out's fries in cut, and they're probably just below In-N-Out's fry quality (which I don't care for to begin with).  The only other significant negative I can think of is their bathrooms. They're just outside the restaurant, and they aren't air conditioned.  Overall, I can't imagine giving The Stand less than five stars. The pros so dominantly outweigh the cons that the cons seem almost insignificant. If you're debating whether you should go there--go. If you're not considering going there--start considering...then go."}
{"text":"Green chile fry bread was terrific!  It's a little shack on the edge of the reservation.  Very friendly.  Great, quick service.  If you bring your own knife, it will be easier to eat.  Seating is pretty much tree stumps, but the food was worth the drive from Mesa.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger with cheese, onions and bacon and some fries. The fries were ok, they unfortunately get soggy in the bag extremely quickly but they taste good. I'm sure they're much better if you're dining in and they don't have a chance to get steamed in the bag on the way home. The burger was excellent. When I pulled it out of the bag, it didn't look like much but it tasted great and the ingredients looked very good. The burger alone is easily worth going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and fries! I had never been there but had heard about it from my wife so we finally went yesterday and two words...Holy ****!! The burgers we're real and tasty, fries were perfect, and the banana shake was over the top. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ridiculous burgers. Love'em! Enjoy.  Seriously good burgers and fries. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"I was born in this neighborhood, so I was curious to see who the next \"victim\" would be at this notoriously cursed location. I saw \"burgers and tacos\" and I was interested, I appreciate a simple menu. Place looks great, all modern tables and chairs and everything else. I will keep this review simple:  Pros:  Burgers were awesome, it's really hard to find a good burger in this town without going to a sit down restaurant. Taco was awesome! Shakes look amazing, interesting flavors, Dulce De Leche / Banana Chocolate and so on. Didnt try the fries but looked like you got a  good amount of them for the money.  Cons: \"Hecho En Arcadia\" ??? The staff had this stupid phrase all over their shirts and it was painted on the outside of the building. You arent from here, you moved here from out of state, like everyone else who lives in \"Arcadia\"   OVERPRICED BOTTLED COKE! $2.49???? This is straight up hipster tax. You can buy these glass bottle mexican cokes at circle K for 99 cents all day, but if you go to one of these new hipster \"dive\" restaurants, they try and play it off like it's some rare treat to have a bottled coke and want to charge you a premium to experience this delicacy.   Over attentive staff. This seems like it would be in the \"pros\" category, but you go out to eat to sample the food and chat with your friends. It was really hard to talk with my friend and enjoy our meals when there is someone reaching in front of your face every five seconds grabbing at your straw wrapper and tray. I literally just finished my taco when a kid comes up and tries to grab the tray from under my nose. Chill out dude, I've still got a lime and hot sauce on there that I might want to play with. I actually had to tell him I was going to keep the tray with me, which led to a quizzical look from him. So I was sucking on my lime, talking with my friend, and another staff member comes up and just snatches my tray from under me without asking! Pretty annoying.  Overall, food is good, if a little pricey ( $6 for a burger $3 for fries $2.50 for a coke. That's kind of a lot for a burger joint. ) Place is nice and clean but a little douchey, trying to bring some Scottsdale pseudo-diveyness to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wish this review was about food but they wouldnt even allow me to get that far. They refused to take an order for pickup and said I would need to come in and wait. As I prefer to not spend my entire lunch break solely waiting for my food to cook, they have ensured I will not be frequenting their location or recommending them to any of my co-workers."}
{"text":"Seriously life changing! I had the stand burger with cheese and roasted jalapeños, French fries with side of stand sauce and homemade fresh squeezed peach lemonade. The French fries hands down best of my life , the burger big juicy super crunchy fresh veggies and the lemonade perfection. I will try the shakes next and definitely will be a regular at this charming amazing drive thru joint!"}
{"text":"They were great under previous ownership.  Now, the quality has dropped, no more mini tacos.  The service has slowed to a crawl.  The employees are constantly eating and taking up seats in the restaurants.  The burgers have very little of the sauce that made them famous.   It's a train wreck there now!!  So sad to see it deteriorated in less than a year."}
{"text":"Super good burgers. Everything fresh. Great to see in Arcadia. Tacos are really good also. Must try the shakes"}
{"text":"Similar to In&Out but more flavor and juiciness. Really enjoyed this burger. Fries are delicious too."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great staff!! An employee that we assumed to be just your regular employee stopped by to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. When we seemed surprised and appreciative, he asked if we had been there before. We said no this was our first time but we'd heard great things. He thanked us for coming in and said he hoped our experience was going well. When we were almost done with our food, he came back by with a shake for each of my girls and again thanked us for coming in.  The shakes were amazing! Banana and Dulce de Leche.  He turned out to be the owner who obviously takes pride in his restaurant and the patrons that choose to eat there. We left very happy and very impressed with the entire experience!"}
{"text":"This place always seems like they have a line in the drive thru. Fortunately it wasn't busy when we stopped by. Tried all of the tacos. Tacos were good but could have used a little more \"kick\". They didn't have the corn in season but maybe next time. Overall good little place for the price."}
{"text":"First time here and I was really impressed with the quality of food.  My husband and I both ordered the Standard with cheese. My husband added the butter carmelized onions and I had everything on it. The meat was really tasty and the sauce that they add to it gives it extra flavor.  We also ordered the fries and they weren't soggy at all. Cooked perfect.  We got a chocolate shake and this was seriously one of the best shakes I have ever had. It was so delicious!  My husband and I shared one but next time I will be getting my own.  I would make the drive just for the shake."}
{"text":"The food is great and the horchata is amazing! It's a little pricy for a burger and fries,  but I keep going back so it's worth it. Its usually pretty crowded inside and the outside seating is not my favorite."}
{"text":"THE best burger in town. Hands down. Life changing even.  Our fav burger place was Zinburger. That has now been overtaken by this little gem. Customer service is amazing!  The tacos, and shakes are beyond and this is my husband and I'd new favorite place to treat ourselves."}
{"text":"I tried out this place yesterday. The burger was very delicious and I liked the simple menu and add on items. I added the roasted jalepeno and it was very tasty, especially with the special sauce they have. The fries were OK, I think I got the bottom batch, so not very fresh and a little too crispy. Overall very good though and you come for the burger and higher quality food. I'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new joints.  Gluten free, tasty, fantastic service, and fast.  Simple menu, but covers all the necessities."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  No frills or gimmicks.  Just a simple bun, meat, and cheese burger with some spread & lettuce. High quality ingredients will beat out gimmicks for me anyday.  Or maybe i was just experiencing euphoria from their Salted Dulce de Leche shake which is an absolute delight.    The short rib taco is also a quality offering if youre not feeling like a burger.  And I still need to go back when their Street Corn is back in season.    The Stand is a Great place."}
{"text":"This place is da shizzity nit. Hollatchaboi.   Burgs n tacs be on point fsho. Coke products no doubt. Get Yoself summa that!"}
{"text":"Caveat - I am a wimp.  I don't like spicy so I don't eat their tacos.  But their burger is my favorite burger in town.  And the banana shake is ridiculous.  So delicious.  Great fries, nice staff, and a drive through for when I don't want to put on shoes :-)"}
{"text":"The Salted Caramel Dulche de Leches shake is life changing. Maybe the best shake I have ever had. It is the basis of this 5 star review. The burgers and fries are also good and the ingredients have a high quality taste. No not pass on the shake, I have been thinking about it ever since I tried it two weeks ago!"}
{"text":"I don't write too many reviews on here, mainly because I'm lazy... However I have to write a review for The Stand because I believe people should know how good it is. (And selfishly I want them to succeed so I can keep eating there.)  Starting with the design, clean, modern, minimalistic. The same approach was taken with the menu. Small, clean, and to the point.  Pricing - VERY reasonable for what you get.    Tacos - So far I tried the short rib and the chicken. The short rib packs plenty of flavor and is very well balanced. The chicken was good for sure, I just feel like the short rib is where it's at. (A+ short rib) (B+ chicken) I may be bias on this one...  Burgers - Cheese or no cheese. Fancy toppings optional. I tried \"The Standard\" with cheese. Clean, simple, no bull shit all American burger. Topped with their signature \"the stand sauce\" reminds me of a homemade in n out burger. Tasty to the max. (A)  Fries - Handcut, Real potatoes fried golden and tossed with sea salt. Clean flavor with no greasy after taste. (A+)  Milkshake - Damn they're tasty. In fact, I will go on record saying it's the best I've ever had. I've tried the Banana and the Dulce de leche, both amazing and hand made. Bonus points to The Stand as well for being awesome and supplying a proper big ass straw for a thick shake. If nothing else it's worth the trip and soon to be long wait just for the shake.   Summary - The Stand is not revolutionizing the world in how crazy they can get with their menu by putting over thought shit on there. Instead they took good food and made it better. I can say that after being to most of the burger spots in Arcadia and the Biltmore area that The Stand is one of the best.   P.S. - to anyone who may question this review I want to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with The Stand either personally or through business. I just happen to think it's really good."}
{"text":"The food is really great, but the prices are a little high. It can be a little pricey when you're ordering for more than one person other than that great place."}
{"text":"I had wanted to come here a few times before but it never worked out.  One time it was closed, the other time I was still full from lunch.  I was in the neighborhood today and a burger sounded alright.  I walked in and placed my order for a Standard w/cheese and an order of fries.  My total came out to almost $9.00.  Eek!  One reason it can't be higher than 3 stars.  I paid my money and took a seat.   Side story here..............  When I was sitting there waiting for my food, some young dude was either getting interviewed for a job, or he was freshly hired and the manager/owner?  was breaking down the expectations/rules etc.  I pretty much got a front row seat for the way The Stand works.  I got financial info, customer service info, cleaning tips etc etc.  I will be sure to take my knowledge to the next board meeting and present my findings accordingly.  Anyways.....some of the conversation was interesting, some of it was lecturey.  A few minutes went by and my burger and fries came out.  Here is how they were.  Standard Burger w/cheese ($5.55) -  This burger is a more pricey In N Out Double Double.  The only difference is the lettuce they use.  They use hand leafed dark lettuce here while In N Out uses a romaine style lighter colored lettuce.  2 patties, cheese, onions, tomatoes, sauce and pickles.  All of this is stuffed between what seemed like an egg type bun.  The burger was pretty good.  The overwhelming taste/ingridient was definitely the pickles.  They were good too.  The beef was fresh, the cheese melted well and overall it was a pretty good burger.  A little pricey though...its like $5.55 plus tax, just for the burger!  Fries ($2.29) -  These were hand cut fries.  They season them nicely with both salt and pepper.  They were pretty crispy and tasted good.  I preferred them over an In N Out style fry.  I would get them again.  Overall, the meal was good but not great.  The burger was tasty and the fries were crispy and seasoned well.  It is very expensive for what you get though IMO.  I am glad I tried it out, but I'm not purposely coming back and driving down here to eat here again."}
{"text":"The Stand exists in a time/space warp that makes it sound like \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" is always playing. You're slightly concerned a seagull might jack your fries. There's just a little bit of sand under your nails. It's several decades ago.   Time moves slower, service moves correspondingly. Burgers and fries are done simply and well, with no attempts at extra flare - unless you count Stand Sauce. It's not bare bones, it's classic in a way that makes one nostalgic for the idea of a time they may or may not have actually lived in.   Overall, it's a welcome helping of affordable simplicity in a culinary wonderland neighborhood laden with more expensive, modern burger-things."}
{"text":"You guys are awesome. Solid food and friendly people!!!!!! Specialty shakes are soooo goooood."}
{"text":"Interesting to note that all bad/mediocre reviews of this burger stand have been moved to the \"not recommended\" pile...anyway, we live near here so tried this place several times after it opened.  The burgers are pretty good, shakes are excellent and and tacos OK although a bit small.  Also, it's fun that they have real Mexican coke, although they are frequently \"out\" of other authentic treats like horchata and Mexican corn.    The main thing that keeps us away is the service.  Waits are interminable, made even more annoying by the \"aren't we cool\" attitude of the servers.  Pro tip: if you're working in a fast food restaurant, you're there to get people their food, just like if you worked at McDonald's.  And forget about the drive through, I have tried that a few times just to try and avoid the annoying cashiers inside, but have never waited for less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite things in one spot, tacos and burgers, it's a dream come true! The burgers are so juicy and the melted cheese makes for a savory taste bud explosion with every bite. Their fries are crispy, golden, and salty just the way I like em, don't forget to order the fry dipping sauce because it's so yummy!!   Now I've only had a bite of one of their tacos and I remember enjoying it very much! I just love their burgers so much I haven't been able to deviate from ordering that.   On to my absolute favorite part of The Stand experience...their milkshakes. Oh. My. Goodness. The Banana Stand and the Salted Dulce de Leche milkshakes are to die for!!! They are SO creamy and honestly the best milkshakes I've ever had the pleasure of sucking down. Once you start, you won't put it down until it gone.   Their staff is very friendly and the owner has been on site every time I have visited. He has made my boyfriend and mines visit feel extra welcome. I can't wait to go back!  Last to note, the prices are super reasonable!"}
{"text":"First time here!  Had burger with bacon and caramelized onions.  Excellent!!   Fries we excellent. Had a milkshake and it was excellent.  Came at 2:30 in the afternoon. Cashier was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Simply place your order at the counter and they'll bring it to you.  Nice secluded covered patio.  The burger itself was  nice , thick, fresh and  had lots of flavor .  The fries were really good with the accompanying \"stand sauce \" ten bucks is pretty standard for burger and fries. Tried to order  the dulce du leche shake but they had run out of vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Can I just say that The Stand is my FAVORITE burger place. Sorry to my Cali crew but The Stand wins out over In N Out, but just barely. That being said, this place just oozes the idea of a little neighborhood hamburger stand, Uber cool. I met my AOB boys here for lunch. Now as I said, this is a burger stand. I stress burger because they only have 1 burger on the menu, The Standard ($ 5.19). Great name for it as well. To be fair they do have a burger that's not on the menu but you'll have to ask the girls at the counter what the secret menu is (a la In N Out). The Standard is a TWIN house-ground ALL Beef patty masterpiece. It comes with what I would consider 'The Standard' burger toppings; lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickle plus they squirt on The Stand sauce as well. That's it. And for anyone that likes a humburger, that's ALL you need. Myself, I like Cheese on my burger and for ($ .50) you can add that as well. Aside from cheese, they offer some other add ons, which they call 'Stand-Ins' for you to make your burger, yours: Thick Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon from Niman Ranch ($1.59),  Butter Caramelized Onions ($.79), Fresh Grilled Jalapeno Peppers ($.79), and a Gluten Free Bun ($1.79). Go ahead and get your creative brain a flowin. If you're not in the mood for a burger, try the Taco's. Seriously. Other restaurants that sell Taco's should really come here and check out what this place accomplishes for the paltry sum they charge for some dang good Taco's. You can get your Taco 3 different ways although they all start with a nice corn tortilla; Short Rib ($2.99), braised short rib, pickled red cabbage, cotija queso fresco, diced onion & cilantro. Chicken ($2.79), roast chicken, pickled red onion, cotija queso fresco & cilantro. Vegetarian ($2.59), fresh seasonal vegetables, quinoa, black beans, pickled red cabbage & onions, and cilantro. The Stand also offers a few sides to compliment your burger masterpiece or Taco's; Hand Cut French Fries ($2.29), Mexican Street Corn ($2.59, only when in season), Tortilla Chips ($2.09), add Salsa for ($.70), & Chips & Guacamole ($3.79).  S & T ordered The Standard and I ordered The Standard with Cheese plus we all got the hand cut fries. No complaints from S & T but let me tell you that my burger was amazing. The twin patties were cooked & seasoned perfectly. They had a nice crust but were oohh so juicy. The bun was fresh as were all the toppings. I also added the caramelized onions which elevated this cheeseburger to a whole new level. And those who know onions know that they have to be slow cooked down with butter, not oil. OMG. Winner winner cheeseburger dinner. Our fries were crispy and delish. If you're concerned about the fries not being cooked enough ask for them crispy.  The Stand also offers Coke products & iced tea ($2.29/$2.79), bottled Coke from Mexico ($2.49), and some incredible fresh lemonade, flavored lemonade and Horchata made on site ($2.70/$3.29).  But the real deal meal enders are the hand-spun shakes ($3.99) for Vanilla or Chocolate or splurge for a specialty flavor ($4.49) like Salted Dulce De Leche, Chocolate Chile or Banana Stand. Yummy frozen goodness. Oh, and these bad boys are THICK. Note to drive-thru people: You'll need to give it a bit of time if you plan on trying to drink it through the oversized straw they give you. The Stand epitomizes EVERYTHING that is good about having taste buds. Great food, great prices, great employees, uber cool old school feel. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday afternoon. I usually get food for my co-workers and we've been curious to try this place out because it was a diamond in the otherwise rough Indian School Rd. area. I got to the drive-thru at 2:30, thinking that it would be quicker than going in.  I had to be at work at 3, so no problem. Boy, was I so wrong.  As I arrived at the speaker-box, the employee immediately told me to hang on a moment as he was busy with the current customer at the window. No problem: new store, new employees, new things to learn, I understand.   Then ... silence. 5 minutes later, still no response. Cars were starting to pile up behind me so I finally asked if I could order and this is the reply, 'Oh ... yeah, I forgot you were there.'  Cool brah, my self-esteem thanks you.   I ordered a dulche de leche shake, the short rib and chicken tacos, and the burger with fries. When I rolled up to the window, the younger man working the register tells me to wait, again, as the card machine wasn't working and my food would take a little bit. Understatement of the year.  It's 2:55 now and I'm wondering if they're plucking the chicken feathers and scraping the meat off of bones back there because that's the only excuse for having to wait so long. When they finally work things out and hand me my food,  I end up late to work, hastily give out the food to my co-workers, and sneakily eat my own burger behind the counter.   Basically: I don't see the difference in buying a burger from here or 5 Guys even though they say it's made with different ingredients. Both are the same high prices (when you take toppings into account), same patty size, don't come with fries, and they both have excessive juice/oil dripping down my hand. Fries taste exactly like the salt and pepper Boulder Canyon chips except they went a little heavy with the black pepper, and when I asked my co-workers if they enjoyed the tacos, they told me next time to save my money and go to Tacos Sahuayo nearby for something tastier and cheaper.   The only thing i can compliment them on is the dulche de leche shake, but anything else is just alright, nothing special. I hate it when everyone else has a good experience and I'm the odd one out :["}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com lol. Good to add extras like bacon. Fries are decent. Only thing is it's small!  Shakes are thick! Taste amazing!will come back!"}
{"text":"The best! Best! Best! Best! Best burgers, best fries and oh em gee the milkshakes. The salted dulce de leche and banana stand are so amazing. Always friendly service and love that they have a drive thru! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome Burger spot. Cheap. Fast. Tasty. Imagine Culver's & In N Out burgers combined together, that's what Stand tastes like. The only thing I don't like about the place is the fries, there way to salty for me. But, other than that, it's a solid burger joint that I'll probably come back to again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Order in, drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme).  They \"get\" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive through.  I haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries.  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce, tomato, onion fan.  Only gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries.  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else.  Same with the fries, salt is all you need!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! Outside looks a little sketchy but as soon as you go inside that all changes. Amazing service. The servers are so sweet and wonderful. Always complementing people and making them feel comfortable.   Now the food. What a burger. It was so good!! The butter grilled onions are delicious and their guacamole is outstanding!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Denver with our teenage son and came because of reviews. They were right about the food! What is on the very limited menu is done well. Simple, unpretentious and tasty. But don't expect friendly. Stood at the counter for several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. That's fin e. But then, no greeting, no smile. I'm guessing the employees aren't happy here, either because they are underpaid, treated badly or hired without much thought. Any of these reflects poorly on management."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've ever had... but it was REALLY good!  I hit up The Stand for lunch and received quick, helpful service.  The girl at the counter made suggestions since I had never been there before... and she was spot on.    I had a cheeseburger with bacon (because why would anyone ever order a burger without bacon???) and struggled to not gobble up the whole thing!  Note that the place is tiny (or as real estate agents would call it, \"cozy\").  And I mean, get to know your neighbor, because you may be sharing a table with someone who also is enjoying a delicious burger or tasty tacos."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great fries and tacos! So glad we found this on Yelp. I pass by this place often and never thought of stopping in. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Stand pretty regularly since they opened last year. It's simple food, prepared expertly, with great attention to detail. The owners are almost always present, and when they're not, everything is still smooth. The staff is friendly and helpful and on the ball. It must be a great place to work too, because there is surprisingly low turnover for a restaurant, and staff members always seem to be moving fast and enjoying themselves. The thing I like most about The Stand is, even though they got busy and popular right away, they have not become complacent. I'm there often enough to notice that they continue to fine tune their food and operations, tweaking cook times and chop-thicknesses and packaging materials ... settling for nothing less than perfection. In fact, I'm going to get myself a burger right now. And a shortrib taco. Jealous?"}
{"text":"This place was ok, nothing great with my experience. Went through the drive through and got a burger without the bun, in a lettuce wrap. Fries were a bit greasy but good. They did have gluten free buns too."}
{"text":"This place rarely disappoints. There's the occasional wait in line, or at the drive-thru, but all-in-all this place is stellar. Also, all if their staff is always super friendly.  I'm not keen on the tacos, but everything else is very on-point.  You cannot go here and NOT have a shake. My personal favorite is the salted dulce de leche, but you can't miss with any of their other flavors.  The burgers and fries are above par, and beat the average burger drive-thru by a lot more than a stone's throw.  I'm guaranteed to keep comin back to this nice little spot."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite hamburgers in the city! The grilled jalapeño on top is what seals the deal. Delicious and tart lemonade. Caramel milkshake is ridiculously good. Every time I go, I walk away excessively full.   Small indoor seating area. Clean.   Owner is often there and very friendly."}
{"text":"Had the Standard burger.  Very tasty! Looks small at first, but is a double, and is quite filling.  Mondays are free fries day, if you buy a burger.  Also carry Mexican Coke, which is better than regular Coke.  Handily better than burger chains like In and Out, McDs, BK, JIB.  Maybe on par with 5 guys, but being a local place, definitely gets bonus points.  Definitely will be back.  I want to try the lemonade.   Place was clean inside.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Arrived at just the right time, when it was empty.  As we finished, the afternoon rush started, and it was time to go.  Inside, is TINY.   Might be able to seat 15 people.  While there is outside seating, summer time is not the time to be outside.    If you go to get a burger there, I recommend get it to go or drive thru, unless it is empty and you can grab a seat."}
{"text":"Had a cheeseburger with jalapeños, fries, and an horchata. Tasty!! One of my faves so far in arcadia/Biltmore area. Are my tastes similar to yours?.....I like 5 guys, the stand and the Chicago hamburger co. Dislike Delux Burger and Zinburger."}
{"text":"The Salted Dulce De Leche Milkshakes is greatest thing to happen to Phoenix since the invention of the air conditioner. Because it's Made the old fashioned way with real ice cream, heaps of salty sweet caramel goodness and local love, I have to assume it's low in calories and recommended by state and federal health authorities alike.  Regardless it's delicious and worth your four hundred pennies.  The burgers and fries are also quite good--I'd compare them to a rich man's N-n-Out.  Greasey goodness with some some fresh fixings with less of the assembly line feel/taste of the chain.  The owner is remarkably attractive and fit for someone who owns/works at a fast food establishment.  Hence my assumption about the milkshakes resulting in good healthy and longevity."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for ages, so after driving by so many nights, last night we decided to stop. The husband and I shared a burger and a chocolate shake. The burger was legit... very large, juicy, and flavorful like a burger should be (not a fancy type burger.... a casual type burger). It comes with two patties (why no one patty option?), cheese, lettuce, tomato, 'secret sauce' served on a buttery bun. It was definitely good for a drive through burger. I think it would be made much better if I got my own burger and added jalapeños and grilled onions (which the husband doesn't like), but I'll find out next time. The shake was also decent (I don't love shakes)... it tasted like straight up chocolate ice cream, which isn't a bad thing. The service was fast and personable. If I were craving a drive through burger again, forget In and Out, I'd stop here."}
{"text":"I always order their short rib tacos they are so good along with everything else.only once I had ordered a street corn and it was not appetizing- burnt and brown. Otherwise, It's not too pricey and it's very cute inside. Much worth the wait too definitely coming again...and again"}
{"text":"Wow! This was such an awesome find (thanks Yelp!)  Not only did we discover the country side we rolled up on the Stand about 1/2 hr before opening at 11 people had already started posting up to get some of the delicious fry bread. We did the red chile and the bean/cheese. At 5$ these are huge and filling. The owners are very friendly as well"}
{"text":"LOVE the burgers and shakes here!  Fries are not my favorite, but some people love them so I guess you can't please everyone.  This is exactly the kind of local business I like to support...small, quality food, great service.  Good work, folks!"}
{"text":"Gonna keep it simple and tasty just like their menu. It's simple fresh and the place is clean and cute. Their street tacos are good but their hamburgers are best and tasty.  For what they offer and how it taste they deserve the 5 stars. Good job guys."}
{"text":"The Stand is one of my new favorite go to grab and go restaurants. All of their food is high quality, tasty and fresh. Stand-outs are the burger with cheese and grilled jalapenos and the fries. They also make a mean Arnold Palmer. My only complaint is their chicken taco which I wanted to like but is a bit too bland."}
{"text":"I was told by one of my customers \"This place is the S***.\" Well, I don't know about that but it was pretty decent. The customer service was great. The young lady greeted me right away, making me feel welcomed. I love the simple appearance of The Stand. very casual like you might expect from a little \"mom & pop\" place. The simplicity of the menu is great too. I've always felt restaurants need to go back to KISS, Keep It Simple St***d. The simplicity of the menu makes it easier to decide what I want and it doesn't congest the kitchen with a vast menu for the masses. That said...  I had the double cheese burger, an order of well done fries and a small Diet Coke. This was nearly $12. Sticker shock? You bet. Being totally honest, I thought about Red Robin for that price. However, the menu's description of the beefs quality cuts, no doubt played a huge roll in the price point. I felt like the burger was lacking flavor. At least salt the patties while they're cooking, but nope. The meat was very thin and cooked so well done, the meat had a crunch. I would have liked my fries to have a crunch, but no such luck. The portion size was great, winning over In-N-Out's fries. Again, no seasoning, but alas, there are salt shakers on the table. The fries are hand cut, similar to the aforementioned fast food establishment, but I ordered them \"Well Done.\" Well done as in crunchy. Nope! Not crunchy, limp and soggy. I could see it immediately when the young lady brought me my order. I asked \"Those are well done fries?\" to which she replied \"Uh-huh.\" Hmmmm.... Ok. I used to cook in restaurants when I was younger. These fries were cooked in oil that was too cold. I don't say this to bash The Stand, but merely offer a critique in deep fry 101. French fries love soaking in 360 degree oil. At best this fryer was set at 340. Notwithstanding, I will go back. I'm always a man of second chances. I am curious about their tacos. They looked amazing. This place gets four stars because I was mostly impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Perhaps typing this review while I'm anxiously awaiting lunch hour is not the best idea, I'm drooling on my keyboard thinking about the Stand goodness! I've been here a half-dozen times now, have brought friends with me and everyone has loved everything they've gotten. I'd say the burger is my favorite item, and if you're feeling like a serious indulgence go for the Salted Dulce de Leche Shake - its like heaven in a cup.   I've ordered and ate inside as well as gone through the drive-thru window there, and each time my experience has been great. They're making the meals to order, so obviously you're going to wait a minute that but that's better than being served a heat-lamp patty anyday! I love that the burgers as seasoned so well, amazing every time. The fries weren't really my thing, but I'm a picky fry eater so that's to be expected. The tacos were really good too, I've tried all of them and typically lean toward the chicken one as my favorite.   Give the stand a shot, you're going to be glad you did. Can't beat hot, fresh, made to order food for a reasonable price! :)"}
{"text":"The burger was good. The fries were really good. The SHAKE WAS AMAZING, LIFE CHANGING, THE BEST EVER!!! I can't get over how good my Dulce de Leche shake was. I literally licked every last bit of Carmel off my cup. I love that they have a drive through. The service is friendly. And everything is very fresh. Thank you \"The Stand\" I'm a better person because of you!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and well seasoned fries. The fresh made lemonade is refreshing. The inside dinning area is a little small but there is room on the patio for bigger groups."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was super excited because I had heard some wonderful things about their tacos. I ordered a veggie and a chicken taco, they came out quickly and tasted very fresh and flavorful. Unfortunately there was a big bone in my chicken taco. I hurt my tooth and tried to let a worker here know and I was shocked at her reaction. She looked at me, never apologized and acted annoyed that she did not apologize or even offer to fix the situation. I had even mentioned it to her. I probably won't be back based on the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"F fast food, suckas!! There's a new standard in town. The Stand's Standard burger is a prime piece of meat, made up of chuck, brisket, and short rib (hell yeah!) nestled between a soft, pillowy and buttery bun. It's a fine, quick-served burger with all the right fixins' wrapped in wax paper and served like it ought to be - tasty and a little bit cheesy, assuming you're a big boy and opted for cheese.   This is the kind of burger place that doesn't \"wow\" me to the point of culinary orgasm (see my review of The Old Homestead's burger) but it's not trying to. It's not trying to be something it's not (see my review of Miracle Mile Delicatessen's pastrami sandwich). They're pretty clear about what they are - a brown bag burger and taco \"joint\". They don't say Kobe and give you Sirloin or Wagyu and give you Angus. It's clear. You get a good burger and that's what you get.   One burger with a few toppings to choose from, 3 tacos (short rib, chicken, and vegetable), and a few sides is what they offer out of a small, garage-like space. Side note, the chocolate chile milkshake was awesome too - velvety chocolate with just the right amount of heat to keep you wanting more. They did the place up nice. It has charm with its solid wood tables, steal counters, and awesome employees - smiles ear to ear, friendly \"hellos\" as soon as you walk in no matter what task they're managing at that moment, and a sincere appreciation for walking in, ordering, and chowing. Living in NYC, I get sick of certain niceties. What can I say? It's in my nature to welcome a brutha with a head nod not a smile. Fuggedaboutit! But at The Stand, I felt true sincerity and I appreciated it. In fact, I was all about it. Congrats to the owners for wanting to open up a burger joint and succeeding.   So get your a$$ off the pot, cleanse yourself from the garbage you eat for lunch, and go to The Stand, mutha sucka!"}
{"text":"The menu is short - about one item long with 2 options for sides and 4 options for shakes. And it is ALL delicious. Burger, fries, and shake are all simple but perfectly cooked. It is a shack and that suits the menu just fine. The service is fast and efficient. Great place."}
{"text":"I went there around lunch time the other day on the recommendation of a friend.  I had the standard burger with carmelized onion and the short rib taco.  The burger was outstanding, the blend and ratio of chuck/brisket/short rib is spot on.  I opened the wrapper for the taco and there was a huge chunk of meat, quite a lot of protein for a $3 taco.  The flavors were great, but it was a little dry.  Perhaps if they were to shred the meat and mix it with the basting juices?  Overall a great little local joint.  I knocked them down from 5 to 4 stars because of the service.  While the entire staff was very friendly and personable there didn't seem to be much organization resulting in very long wait times inside the restaurant.  It took about ten minutes to get my food after I ordered, when I walked outside the cars in the drive through didn't seem to move much.  I'll definitely go back, but perhaps just not at noon on a Monday."}
{"text":"Firstly - They are not very attentive to waiting customers even though the place is no bigger than 10x10... I had to ask where my food was after waiting for about 15 minutes. The price for the guacamole and chips is overrated for the tiny bit of guacamole that you actually get. The tacos weren't bad. The chicken tacos were sweet (which was weird) and the beef taco was a bit salty for my taste.. I might be up for giving them a second chance based on the other reviews, but my first impression was horrible."}
{"text":"OK this might be my new favorite burger in town.  The burger is about as tasty as can be.  I highly recomend adding bacon and the sautéed onions.  I haven't tried the fires but I'm not much of a french fry person.  I have however had the beef taco and like the burger its excellent.  The customer service could be improved upon but I'm not going to give them lesser review because of it as the food makes up for it (which is rare for me to say).   This is a can't miss place if you like burgers or tacos."}
{"text":"I love a place with a limitted menu.... its like this is what we do, this is all we do, and we do it well. The burgers a are gret because theybare a blend of short rib, surloin and chuck, so very tender.  ALL BURGERS ARE 2 PATTIES! cant beat the price.  The shakes are fabulous and who doesnt want the option of a taco on the side?!?!?   Would have been 5 stars but they only carry mexican corn in the summer.....in az.....i feel like that could be a year rounder."}
{"text":"I like the food but the seating is really awkward inside.  Inside, there's a high table that looks towards the outside tables so if you're near the high table inside or outside, you're kind of in someone else's bubble.  Also, there are only 3 tables inside.  I normally eat where ever I go to lunch since I work nearby and bringing food back to the office doesn't really work."}
{"text":"Dear The Stand,  I have been coming here since I moved to Phoenix last year, thanks to your delicious short rib tacos. I moved to Tempe and regularly make the 25 minute drive to get my fix of savory and sweet delights. Recently, the pickled cabbage (the sweet component that makes the taco.... everything that is good in this crazy world) has turned into a bland afterthought. Why? Why have you taken away the one taco that understood me? Have you given in to sweet-shaming? \"Omg this is too sweet for me...\" As if liking something less sweet makes you cooler? More than? Tell those superior, self-aggrandizing, pleasure-denying fools to shut it. Admittedly, this is the only reason I can think of for changing a perfect taco recipe, so if it's anything else,  please share. I need someone to blame for this travesty, and I don't want it to be you guys. Please bring my tacos back.  M."}
{"text":"The Stand did not disappoint, thank you again, fellow Yelpers! However, I was a bit disappointed (with myself) that I didn't order their famous Banana Hand-spun Shake to go with my Royale. Are you kidding me? I had room and wanted more!   Well, I'll be back for THAT combo, as this will be a regular burger joint for this ex-in-n-out lover...adios to the drab and welcome, my new romance! Hey really, this is a simple double burger with just the right bacon, grilled jalopeneos and carmalized onions and the typical tomato and lettuce accoutrements. Had to try the hand-cut fries, of course, which made a great pairing; crunchy and flavorful, just how I like 'em. Was it typical? I'll find out soon enough.  Service was spot on, as I \"dined in\" outside, and the meal was brought to my table with a smile, and afterwards an offer for a free refill on the soda. Simple, Satisfying and Smooth!"}
{"text":"I really love the food here but there is a need for improvement. The flow of how they process orders and get them out is not good.  They need more than one person taking orders for sure.  If the cashier is going to handle money and pass out food..then they NEED to wear gloves or sanitize their hands in between touching money and the food. Not to mention wear a hair net.  I've seen a red headed employee grab money from tip jar then turn around a grab a burger on a tray with bare hands. I'm sitting here now waiting for my food and seeing this.  Service and sanitation need help!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. On Monday the standard burger is on special for only $7.25. It's a great deal because it comes with fries too. The fries were amazing here! Not too crispy and not too soft, with just the right amount of salt. Loved everything about the burger, bun and their house sauce. Really can't think of how they could improve at all - keep up the great work! If I lived closer I'd definitely be in more often."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Best burger I've had while visiting Arizona! Fresh, tasty, wonderful! Service was great, friendly. Even have a dog friendly patio! Love the fresh fries too!"}
{"text":"Best fry bread in Scottsdale. Support local businesses like this one. Nothing fancy. Just delicious food."}
{"text":"Great place for an old-fashioned burger, fries and a dulce de leche shake.  This is one of those places where you walk in and there's only one item on the menu - a single burger - and you know that burger's gotta be good for this restaurant to still be in existence.  Apparently this location used to serve tacos as well, but unfortunately they've switched to only burgers... but the burgers are dang tasty.  Only complaint is that the price is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Cindy and Mick are owners of the Stand and make great red chili and fry bread among other items on the menu. I have stood in line only to be told \"sold out\" because the food is that good. Come early and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. I'll kept it short. I want you guys to succeed but couple things. Change your tortillas they taste like generic food city tortillas. Then buy a comal if you don't know what that is google it, it's for heating tortillas rub a little oil on the first tortilla to give it a better texture.  Meats good salsa is good too. The staff was very nice and seemed very interested in what the guest thought. Hope you take this in a positive light, but when having such a small menu everything has got to be good.  Good luck will try again in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place, but cannot go as a family without tacos on the menu!   Think hard about this decision!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed but not bad. I understand I'm paying premium for the grain free. They were out of fries so ended up with chips and salsa. The salsa was good flavorful with some heat.   Ive been twice and had the salted dulce de leche shake the first time and horchata the 2nd time. Shake was really good burger was ok (extra for caramelized onions and Niman ranch bacon but in n out is cheaper and tastes almost the same.... The horchata was good very heavy ice.  If I go again I want to try the mexican dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the nieces after a long day of family drama. We wanted fast food but not \"fast food\"! We had a short rib taco, veggie taco, cheeseburger and fries. We also tried the shakes. They had chocolate and I had salted dulce de leche. Agreed...shakes were fabulous! Shorty tacos had great flavor, veggie taco was dry. The sign says \"burgerS\" and tacos\" but there is only 1 burger. It's a double stack cheeseburger with all the fixins plus their special sauce. I found it to be delicious and flavorful but similar to 5guys or In n Out. Fries were soggy by the time we got home (5 minute ride), but still good enough. The service was friendly and fast. I'd go back for the short rib tacos and shakes for sure."}
{"text":"Chic and fancy hamburger spots are popping up all over town.  I've tried them all and nothing comes close to The Stand."}
{"text":"Tiny little place. Went on a Friday during lunch and it was pretty busy but still managed to find a seat. Delicious burgers and fries juts super classic and delicious. They also have homemade juices and such.   Tip: this restaurant ONLY has burgers and tacos.  but they are GOOD. Prices are a bit high for it to be a cheap grab a quick bite type of place"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! Flavorful, quick.  And with friendly service. The tacos and the peach lemonade are my lunch recommendation. The Stand just does it right!"}
{"text":"Great updates neighborhood taco/burger/shake stand & drive thru (puts ingo to shame;) Think throw back but w/a modern twist. Great product, value & family oriented."}
{"text":"\"Hi, two chicken tacos\".   \"So sorry, we are out of chicken\"  \"Ok, how about veggie tacos and some corn\".   \"Sorry. No corn\".  \"Uh ok. How about chips and guacamole\"   \"We ran out of chips\"   (Drives away)"}
{"text":"What are the things that you want from your favorite burger joint?  Simple menu, clean and orderly store, delicious food and great service.   If your checklist includes that, then the stand has what you're looking for.  Met the owner tonight and he was very kind and courteous and you could tell he was proud of his location.   I'm yet to try the Mexican food but their burgers I absolutely love... Especially the thick sliced pickles.   Winner.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"After finding the Hippie Burger Joint closed at 3pm - we made our way to The Stand. We were immediately welcomed and given a brief run-down of how the restaurant prepares its food and where they get it from. When the food came about five minutes after the order, we were treated to some of the best hamburgers we've had in a long time. The house-made chocolate milkshake topped it off and it was bar none the best milkshake I have had."}
{"text":"I tried the Stand after driving by there numerous times. I went to this location when it was Maui Dog, and I must say the new owners have improved the decor. The staff at this restaurant are very friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant looked clean too.  I had a burger and fries. I thought the burger was great and priced very reasonably for an upper echelon fast food burger. I am picky about what toppings I like on burgers, so I was quite pleased that my order was correct.  I docked one star from this review because I thought the fries were disappointing. For one person, the serving size is too large and the cost is too high (this is the same problem that Five Guys has). The fries were mediocre tasting as well."}
{"text":"The Stand is great. It's like a wet dream of a fast food establishment. Fresh and quality ingredients, good service, and decent prices. You can't go wrong with their tacos or burger; both are solid (Chicken tacos are a personal favorite). Milk Shakes are quality too (especially salted caramel). In a perfect world, the Burger Kings and McDonalds out there would be replaced with establishments like this. Nothing crazy, just good solid food made well.   One huge plus side here too is that they are great for people who must eat Gluten Free. Pretty much everything on the menu is either already gluten free (all the tacos, fries, chips) or can be made that way (the burger). They even have gluten free hamburger buns, which I don't see at too many places.   I'd love to see this place be successful, because fast food that is actually GOOD is in short supply. It'd be great to see places like this start popping up more often.   (Sad side note...this used to be the building where Maui Dog was...hate to see that place go, thought it was great; but glad the building was taken over with something else good like this)"}
{"text":"I gave it four stars cause the place is too small for how good it is.  The food was great, had a burger, fries, and a Choco shake which was all outstanding! The staff and service was incredible as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I am thankful that my friend told me about The Stand.   I have had it bookmarked in Yelp for almost a year and one night it popped up and my body was ready.   The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because it is a little expensive.   I wish I could come here all the time and order all of the food but, I would probably go bankrupt if I ate to my heart's content every time.   BB's Rating: As Good As In N Out.....but more expensive.....but worth it."}
{"text":"Great experience. The server/cashier was so friendly and actually enthused to be at work   Such a nice atmosphere with great music and clean eating area. I ordered the standard with cheese. Good burger, vegetables/toppings were so fresh and vibrant. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience, and love the small and local feel. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This place...such a perfect little neighborhood spot! The menu is simple yet everything is amazing! The hand spun shakes are so like something you remember from your childhood and the fries are just yummmmmmm! The burgers are hot fresh and made to order! The atmosphere is adorable and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I looked up the best Fry Bread in the Scottsdale area and this was the top rated so I just had to give it a try. Before we came to Arizona I kept raving about fry bread tacos to my husband and daughter so they were both anxious to try them.  We got there around 11:30am on a Thursday, there were a couple of people there already but we were able to place our order and snag three seats (tree stumps) in the shade of the tree.   I ordered the green chili combo taco, my husband had the red chili combo (combo means that it has the chili AND beans). My daughter had the hamburger taco. After we ordered they let us know that it was going to be a little bit of a wait because they still had to cut up all the greens, we didn't mind waiting at all. We all loved our food and it was worth whatever wait there was (although it was really short).   It seemed like it was mostly locals that were coming up to order, which is a good thing in my book. I love supporting these type of businesses whether I am at home or traveling. Don't hesitate to stop here... you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I am officially addicted to the standard burger and fries. Like this is a problem, someone please help me. Drive thru is on point and the people are SO incredibly nice. But even if the people were rude and I had to move from my vehicle, I would still be swarming this place. Delish."}
{"text":"On big meh...and it barely clears that bar.  Ordered the buger, fries and a short rib taco.  Fries were good.  Burger, not so much.  Bun was really stale...like days, if not weeks, old.  Little flavor to the burger.  Taco was ok, but very salty...and I like salt.  Not the most organized place.  Employees were friendly, but seemed to be running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  Only about 6 people ahead of us and it still took nearly 10 minutes to order.  What's worse is that the menu doesn't really contain many more items that what I ordered so I'm not sure why they can't take orders quickly."}
{"text":"This place has to be in consideration for best (reasonably priced) burger in the valley.  There's one burger on the menu, but man is it delicious.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned meat, fresh toppings and a great bun.  I also explored the chicken taco.  Reasonably priced, packed to the top with flavorful, perfectly slow cooked chicken, this taco is a must order.  The place was so good, I tried it one day, liked it so much, I went back the next day!"}
{"text":"Wowowzza! Yummy! The fries are \"Delish.\" I had heard they had great burgers and fries. They do. However, not digging the price."}
{"text":"Small Food Restaurant with a short simple menu.  Choice of Burger or Street Taco. There is one burger the Standard  which comes with 2 patties and a few options to that which the Carmelized onions are pretty good. The burger is very tasty with the char flavor off the grill loaded with lettuce and tomatoes. I tried the short rib taco with Pico De Gallo and was pretty good.  Also had their chocolate shake and french fries. Chocolate Shake was nice and thick and came with a boba straw. The fries were crispy and good.  The main item seems to be the burgers which are pretty good so there are so many burger restaurants in the Arcadia area this one is overshadowed but on a different level from the gourmet burger restaurants and they seem to be just a casual small local owned restaurant.   I like their small feel and will come back again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today because it's close to my house and it seems to always be crowded.  I'm not a huge burger fan so I get a craving once every blue moon.  It took about 15 minutes to get thru the drive thru, but I figured its worth it since its alway packed.  The only thing I liked were the fries and the Stand Sauce. The burger had zero seasoning so I had to keep putting ketchup on it for every bite. I think I'll just go back for the fries and the Shakes, because they look good.  In&Out is way better and quicker.  Too bad there are none in my area -_-"}
{"text":"I've been through the drive-thru twice now.  The first time I ever went was on my way home from work, late at night, searching for something that was open and conveniently on the way.  It seemed so unassuming and I never had even considered stopping before- now I'm so glad that I have! The first time through I got The Standard, no cheese, no alterations and a side of fries. I don't know if it was hunger but I swore that was the best burger and fries I've had in ages. The fries were super hot, crispy and seasoned in the yummiest mixture of spices. SO GOOD. I was craving it again and went through, this time around noon but my experience wasn't as great. I added jalapeños and grilled onions to The Standard, ordered the fries and a side of stand sauce. This time it cost me around $10 total because of all of the additions and I don't think it was really worth it. The fries were a little soggy and not as generously seasoned as the previous time and the burger was a little greasier and messier to eat. The stand sauce cost extra and it wasn't anything to die for, though it was good. Next time I'll stick to the regular and hope for crispier fries...and get a shake I've been hearing raves about!"}
{"text":"Best milkshakes in town! We ordered a salted dulce de leche, it was creamy and delicious. Also got a side of fries which were pretty good, but the Stand Sauce was the cherry on top. Prices are a little high but it's quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited several times and are never disappointed. I always love eating on their patio. The food is super tasty and fresh and the service is on point. They have the efficiency of of fast food joint and the attentiveness of a sit-down restaurant. Someone will usually come out on the patio to check if everything is good, and take away trays and trash. Most recently when we visited the tall guy I always see working there (owner?) stepped outside as we were leaving from the patio to say goodbye and wish us a goodnight with a smile and a wave.  It was such a simple, yet friendly gesture that made us feel like we are always welcome back.  I will make it a point to support this local business when I am craving burgers and shakes because they have quality food and I love their dedication to making their customers feel valued. If you have had a disappointing experience with their food I highly recommend giving them another chance."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for both burgers and tacos.  Both offerings are delicious and the old school burger stand feel is on-point.   Recently we discovered Mondays for burgers and complimentary fries, which is an awesome bonus considering the prices aren't exactly the cheapest in town.  The burgers are bomb but the tacos are the unsung hero of this menu (both in value and tastiness).  Try them - you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it deserves a solid 3.5 stars. The milkshakes alone are 5 star, but the burgers are just 'ok'. They would be so much better if the buns weren't dry and crumbly. There's nothing that can ruin a burger more than a dry crumbly bun! The short rib tacos were great, though. The service is mediocre. It's just a bunch of high school kids goofing off, messing up your orders and forgetting your sides of sauce. However, if you want a delicious milkshake, definitely try it out."}
