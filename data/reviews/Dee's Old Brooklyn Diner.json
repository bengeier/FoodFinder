{"text":"This place seems to have closed recently. It's been dark every time I drive past it during what are supposed to be open hours, and their phone is disconnected. A shame."}
{"text":"Dee's has been closed for about 2 years now and it's a crying shame. This was the best breakfast diner in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Dee is another greasy spoon/diner in Old Brooklyn. 

There's plenty of Old Brooklyn historical maps and photographs on the walls, the most that I've seen in any business in Old Brooklyn. The service was fine and very friendly. 
However, the place was a tad more pricier than the typical budget breakfast diner (i.e. gabe's and Steve's, both in Old Brooklyn). It was $20 or so for the 2 of us [2 Orange Juice, an omelet with homefries and toast, a breakfast sandwich, and a cinnamon roll]. The food was the same that I'd expect from any other diner although the orange juice tasted freshly-squeezed and not from concentrate. 

If you're in the area looking for breakfast or lunch [they advertise a good chili, although I haven't tried it yet], Dee's is another option."}
{"text":"My friend Ben recommended Dee's for lunch yesterday, so four of us ventured across town.  When we arrived at Dee's, I realized that the building it's located in is owned by my uncle.  Random coincidence, but I used to help him do repairs on the place when he first bought it back in the 80's, back when Don & Judy ran the joint.

Anyway, the decorations were interesting because they included old pictures of Cleveland's street cars and the like.  I haven't eaten here since it was Don & Judy's, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place received a Clean Plate Award.  That was cool.

As for food, my three friends all ordered breakfast, which apparently is served all day.  I wasn't on the same wavelength, so I ordered the Thursday Lunch Special, which consisted of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, corn, and bread.  It was quite good, I must say.  The portion was very large, but I woofed it all down and was content.  I'd say the meatloaf could have used some more chopped veggies in it or something, but it tasted good, even if it was low quality ground chuck.

The server was very attentive and the food was served in a reasonable period of time.  The other patrons in the place were friendly, asking me how my meatloaf was.  

The price was also reasonable, my entire meal with tip was $10.45.  My buddies' breakfast meals were even cheaper, but they didn't get nearly as much grub as I did.

There is hardly any parking, unfortunately, so we parked on the side street adjacent to my uncle's building.  I'll have to ask him to put a parking lot in sometime.  Yeah right.

Recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"I only go to Dee's for the steak burger.  It is one of the finest in Cleveland.  This is one of our traditional C Town lunch places that never disappoints!  Where else can you go directly into the kitchen to place your order and be welcomed?"}
