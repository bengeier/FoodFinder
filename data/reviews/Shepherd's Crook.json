{"text":"Walked in to a lovely looking pub.  Ordered our drinks and food, place was nice and quiet, then a group of 15 rowdy twenty somethings came in, already plastered yelling and swearing and talking about sex acts.  The owner was there,  the did not say anything to this group about quieting down or their language.  They just left. 

The food took an hour to get.  I ordered the chicken curry,  the chicken was not a good selection of meat. The potatoes that came in the chicken curry were raw. I complained about the potatoes and they just said that's how they make them (the fork had a hard time piercing them- sorry not cooked).   The wait staff completely ignored us and other tables. I saw another table that had to go and get their own menus.  

Our server only came up to us once to take our order, different waitress brought the food, and took it away.  My beer glass sat empty my entire meal.  Very poor service. 

First and last time ever going there."}
{"text":"Consistently abysmal food.  Good beer selection, but I have yet to find an item on the menu that has been executed well or with any semblance of care."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy pub with a great beer selection.  Unfortunately the food is terrible.  Unless you are ordering something prepared in the deep fryer, the food is substandard quality and poorly prepared.  Also, the staff is nice enough, but not really friendly.  It feels like they are there to punch the clock and put their time in - they do not go the extra few steps to create a welcoming, fun and social pub experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times over the past year. It is definitely an 'old school' pub. They have a great selection of draft beers which are unique and well priced.  The curry dish is good.  A little too many carbs with potatoes and rice but the flavours are great.  The fish and chips are consistently well cooked - crispy and not too greasy.  Coleslaw is boring and needs to be revised.  Salad are excellent.  Onion rings are handmade and very good. They have interesting specials in addition to the normal menu.  Portions are great.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good food . good people . nice atmosphere
I used to live in Exeter England. I am a big fan of pubs . this is the first pub in Ontario where i felt that i am back to Devon.

Such a nice atmosphere this pub provides. I parked right infront of the building, but there's more parking in the back, as the street is the main Street so parking can be limited.
My partner ordered: wings, and I ordered the fish and chips.
Order came in promptly, but the fish had a weird after taste...in comparison to other fish and chips I've had. The fries were crunchy, and finished it no problem.
Afterwards, we had the chocolate lava cake topped with whipped cream. The server didn't come as often as we hoped...and the reason why is because the servers are not only servers, they are bartenders, greeters & busboys. So I could understand why we had a \"delayed\" time with her.
Overall, pretty good experience. The place is calm, there's no rowdy customers. Can be useful as a casual date kind of place :)

{"text":"From the outside it looks like a real pub. And when you enter, then you're in ! The ambiance is totally there and the decoration is very Irish. 
The team working there is friendly and fast. 
I took the plougham plate and had the good surprise of having a nice variety of cheeses, salami, meat, pickles and bread. That was delicious. The cheese comes from the cheese store on the other side of the street. 
Don't take the glass of white wine. Go for there speciality: beers !"}
