{"text":"Read good reviews and decided to give it a shot.
The food was ok, but nothing special.
Went there on Sunday night, whole place smelled like a WC, my wife's martini came in a dirty glass with someone's BRIGHT RED lipstick on it. Gross.
And to wrap it all up they tried to overcharge us for appetizers.
There are tons of good places out there, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I first heard about this place through a travelzoo offer.  The deal required that I surrender the coupon when I placed my order, which always makes me a little apprehensive that the service or food won't be as good.  I was also a little skeptical about how it would turn out due to some other reviews.  Overall, I think this restaurant has a lot of potential but it is still a little rough around the edges.

Meal
1. Lobster Bisque -  It was \"ok\".  It was not memorable other than a thin visible crust appearing on the bisque. The type of crust that lets you know that I had the first bowl in a while.  My gf had the mushroom soup which was ok but nothing special.
2. Thai Beef Salad - I'm not usually a salad person but it came with the TravelZoo offer and it turns out.. this was pretty darn good! The description says beef strips on baby greens but there's also plenty of other fun stuff to give each bite great texture and crunch (rather than boring old baby greens). The beef strips looked a bit small at first but remember, this is an appetizer, and it turned out that there was enough for almost every forkful.   My only complaint is that it was bit heavy on the Asian inspired dressing.
3. Surf & Turf - Both my gf and I ordered the surf and turf. Presentation wise, I was a bit surprised and disappointed that that the restaurant had prepared 1 steak and cut it in half for each plate rather than cutting it before it was cooked so that it would look like we each had a whole steak.  If you check out the pics, that's how it was served to us, I didn't cut it before taking a picture. That being said, this was the best cut of steak I've ever had under $50. It needed a bit of salt but I would go back to this restaurant just to get this cut of steak again.  The lobster was also great.  I also appreciate that the vegetables that it was served with weren't doused in butter.
4. Apple crumble a la mode - Don't touch the container.. it's hot! I love dishes that are prepared just for me. And a la apple crumble isn't served out of a larger dish, it's baked just for you!  It's also served with a strawberry sauce that I didn't much care for.  

Service
Our waitress was nice and the food came in a timely fashion. As I said, the restaurant is still a bit rough around the edges.  The menu describes many ways that the lobster can be prepared (hong kong style, baked, etc..)  and it would have been nice if she knew how the lobster was prepared as part of the surf and turf.  It also would have been nice if the lobster claw was cracked or deshelled. Given that the restaurant is trying to appeal to an upscale clientele, it's a bit awkward to use a shell cracker at the table when you're dressed up.

Ambiance - Dark and upscale. Almost half of the restaurant was a bar and the other half was the dining area.  Pretty quiet and very spacious compared to the Keg. Very roomy and luxurious booths that they give to couples (when 4-6 people could fit in them). But.. there were some weird acoustics and we could clearly hear our neighbours.  I don't think our neighbours were shouting and we couldn't hear anybody else. So... you may want to avoid this restaurant if you are going to break up with someone despite having the big booth.

How much I paid - $65 for the travelzoo deal. They charged $28 for tax and tip. I added another $5 to the tip because the service was good.

Free Tip - There's a huge parking lot on the north side of the plaza.  If you're coming in from Highway 7, take the second right (rather than the first) into the plaza. It will look like an office and you won't see signage, but all the restaurants are just around the corner. This is part of the same complex but people usually only park here for Demetre's and Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine.  If you're going to Maxx, park on the East side of this north lot and the Maxx is very close.  This lot has way more spots and is way less frustrating than parking around Chako, Marlow, the Keg, etc...

Will I go back? The thai beef salad and the cut of the steak will be worth the return trip - even at full price."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 5. It's dim inside (very classy and romantic in certain parts i.e. where there are booths :) ). There was a 20% off promotion (i don't know when it ends though). 

Server seemed really rushed when we first met him. He did know his stuff though (we asked him for recommendations for sauce pairings and just what's good to eat). We did have to wait a bit for the bill. 
Friends ordered pineapple fried rice, surf and turf special. I tried the baked oyster, the filet mignon in chasseur sauce, and the soft shelled crab. 

fried rice came in 1/2 a pineapple (we found out later that they don't pack the pineapple in the takeout (if we could, we were going to make a friend wear it as a hat when we had dessert at Destiny (bubble tea place). So they either re-use it or ... they reuse it :) we didn't get to see the bottom of the pineapple-bowl, so we couldn't tell if it's been reused (scratches from forks, etc).

surf and turf was a really good deal - came with a 6 oz steak and a whole lobster tail. Apparently the lobster tail was really good! The server forgot to give one of the girls mashed potato (gave her sweet potato fries instead) and came back with the mashed potato (he noticed right away, after we waved him over, and didn't really need us to tell him). 

soft shelled crab - there was a peanut-y sauce for it, and it was on a bed of mangoes. Mangoes aren't quite in season yet... so maybe in that case they shouldn't use mangoes - it was still fairly unripe. Peanut sauce worked with the soft shelled crab, but it wasn't anything special. 

Baked oyster - YUM YUM YUM. a must try. it's one big oyster, with a yummy sauce (can't recall what was in it). Warm and had good texture. 

Filet Mignon 10 oz  - we asked for medium rare.. .and actually got medium rare! The knife easily sliced through the meat. Chasseur sauce (red wine + mushrooms) was good - never had that type of sauce before. It came with carrots, peas, and radish.

No complaints with the place (and the 20% off :P ). Everyone was really full by the end of it and fairly impressed with the restaurant. Could be a 5 if we didn't have to wait for the server and if our food order didn't get messed up."}
{"text":"Well, this place was a bit unexpected!  On the outside, it looks something like a family diner trying to be a fancy seafood and grill.  What's up with that scroll-script diner-esque red logo and that plastic banner hanging outside?  On the inside, it actually looks like a fancy seafood and grill.  But, does it taste and serve you like a proper seafood and grill?  The unanimous answer: yes!

We were convinced by someone who I guess is a manager (with tattoos, very cool and this place gets less family diner like by the minute), to come in to try their 'amazing' steaks when we dropped by just to check out the menu.  The additional 10% off he offered convinced us to at least give it a try.  Plus, it was a Friday, and they were having free salsa lessons at 9:30PM.

The ambiance - dark, modern, cool.  The dinner clientele on a Friday night - surprisingly, a good smattering of area families with young children.

The service - eager, helpful, a bit green and inexperienced.  Points for trying even though it might have been the first time the server handled a pepper grinder.

The food - Again, surprisingly great!  We had the Ahi Tuna encrusted with white and black sesame, done in a standard medium rare.  Wow!  The two good sized chunks were seared to perfection.  That sesame crust kept the moisture in while giving it just that something special.  Served with your choice of carb and veggies, this dish was an unexpected hit.  The 12-oz Maxx special cut steak was so flavourful and tender.  The whole thing was also much bigger than expected.  The additional mushroom side was alright but nothing to brag about.  For beverages, we had the canned Strongbow cider - just a perfect compliment to the seafood and grill.    There are random Chinese fusion options on the menu which I found a bit odd (like the fried rice), but I guess it makes sense if families with grandparents come here given the general ethnic mix of the area.

At precisely 930PM on the Friday, the floor of the main dining are was cleared and a dance floor opened up for the free lessons.  The families with young children left, and lots of new, mature people moved in for the lesson.  Fun times!  Cha cha cha!  My hip hurt from other physical activities during the week (don't tell me I'm getting old!  Say it ain't so!) and so we left before the dancing got into full swing.

A great addition to this corner of the dining universe with it's slew of otherwise big chain restaurants."}
{"text":"...love this place! it used to be cafe mirage, which i was quite indifferent to, nothing special. now that it's become a seafood and grill i hope it stays! decor inside is the same, but the menu has completely changed for the better. it is more upscale, has a pretty good variety of choices, and it's open until 2am!

we ordered:
lobster bisque, excellent. 
p.e.i. steamed mussels, good, would have been excellent if the mussels weren't so small for the price that it is. 
surf and turf special for one, good. 
vancouver crab in ginger, scallion, and garlic sauce, good. 

loved our entire experience. waiter was a great guy, food was great, and the friday night salsa and dancing in the dining area was a nice touch to the evening. would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I broadly put restaurants into 2 categories: food restaurants and \"atmosphere\" restaurants. Food restaurants exist to satisfy my taste buds without draining my wallet too much. Atmosphere restaurants are where you bring your romantic dates, business meeting or otherwise need a cozy atmosphere. Maxx is definitely an atmosphere restaurant. 

We ordered a wild mushroom soup and 2 x veal oscar. The food review is pretty quick because there isn't much to talk about. The food is delicious, and comes in very fancy plates. Portions are below average if I compare to a \"food\" restaurant but it's acceptable for this kind of place. 

The atmosphere is nice. The tables are nice. The atmosphere is a little dark, which is perfect for a date. Price wise of course it's not cheap, but not the most expensive out there. These kinds of places tend to be expensive but if you're here to impress, you shouldn't be worried about the price. If you're just hungry and want good food, you can get the same quality of food at other places at lower prices."}
{"text":"Surf n' Turf CliMAXX!! Encouraged by some fellow Yelpers' reviews I came here with my family and, I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of food we received. From the moment we were seated we were treated with great attention, and there wan't a moment when either our waiter or the owner were not tending to our needs. We ordered a crab, lobster, and steak dinner. Everything was delicious especially the Thai curry crab. Sometimes fusion cuisine does not work, MAXX  works it good, do not fear. The atmosphere is very lively and the patio is nice and big. We came here on a Friday, so as a bonus we joined in dancing to Latin Music on the dance floor (different room). I would definitely come back on a Friday. Bring a big appetite and your dancing shoes!"}
{"text":"This place was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had! We were there on a Saturday night recently, a group of 8, with no reservation. We waited for about half an hour until they gave us a table. Now, I was expecting a wait, but the place was half empty, and the half dozen servers just seemed to be aimlessly wandering about the dining area. They didn't have enough menus, so we didn't get any. They were understaffed, so we had to wait for another 15 minutes before we successfully flagged down a waiter to bring us water and some menus. We should have just left.

A friend ordered oysters and a clam chowder. Just that took almost 30 minutes to arrive. The oysters were tiny and unremarkable. The chowder was runny, and had no clams in it, whatsoever.

It was another 45 minutes after that for our mains. And the entire time, other then filling up our glasses occasionally, no one stopped by to ask us how we were doing, or if they could get anything for us, or to apologize and offer to check on our food for us. We had to flag down a server to get the manager for us, and he offered to give us a discount on the bill. We weren't the only ones complaining either. 

The food was was mediocre. The pasta was still uncooked in the centre. Seafood was overcooked and dry. My rainbow trout died for nothing. 

The manager did end up giving us 10% off the bill, but nothing would have redeemed them by that point. I'm never going to go back. I can't really think of a single positive thing to say about this restaurant....... oh, well, the chairs were comfy."}
{"text":"Maxx Seafood & Grill is one of the newly open restaurants in the 404 and Hwy 7 area. This used to be Cafe Mirage and Maxx kept almost the same layout and deco... the only difference is the menu and of course that tank of live lobsters at the corner.

As implied by the name, the menu are Seafood based with an international twist. You will find Thai, Chinese and Italian interpretations of different dishes.

As usual, my DC ordered: (Yes you know it!)

Linguine Fruitti di Mare in Tomato Sauce ($16.95)
- quite good at the price point: shrimp, scallops, calamari, fish, clams, mussels 
- the request for rose sauce based to be replaced with the light tomato sauce was accommodated
- pasta was prepared al dente

Baked Oyster in Garlic and Herbs ($4.95)
- not bad... but nothing special
- Oyster was fresh but I probably would not order that again

Lobster Bisque ($8.95)
- has really nice aroma of lobster and not too salty
- There are quite a few pieces of lobsters inside, but they were a little overcooked

Services is excellent. I like how the waiter went through the Daily Specials with pricing.. as I hate surprises.

Oysters are $2 each, I think I will go back to try that again... maybe with a glass of sparkling wine...."}
{"text":"Bought the Travelzoo voucher and tried to use it last night ( sat. 23rd, 2012) Well reservations were for 7:30, we arrived at 7:15. Sat at the table for 2 hr's for a salad. All the people around us that had vouchers, had the same experience and some even left. Tables that had no voucher had a full basket of bread..we had 2 buns. We were told that they were short staffed..right...with 3 ladies at the bar talking and doing nothing...while people are waiting 2 hrs for a salad. This place is to be avoided at all costs...it's to bad that 469 people so far have been trapped into buying this voucher. I am asking for a refund monday morning."}
