{"text":"Went to Sunset Harbor Bar and Grille with friends for lunch. The view was beautiful but the food not so much. I had the perch sandwich and I needed a magnifying glass to find the fish. Even after I took half the bun off I still cannot tell you if the fish was tasty or not. My friend had a Sangria and said it was not all that good. The BLT needed more B. It's a shame because it's such a beautiful location. Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"My daughter from LA took me, the Ohio resident, to this little bar/restaurant.  I had no idea it was there.  She probably found it on Yelp!

I live on the lake and I'm not overly impressed with lake views.  But, something about this spot felt very relaxed, vacation-like, and pleasant.  Since my favorite fish fry place went downhill over a year ago, I've been looking for a replacement.  The fried fish, French fries, and coleslaw meal was reasonably priced and pretty darn tasty.  

My daughter had the fish tacos and a side salad.  She could only eat one taco-- they were huge.  My hubby and his golfing buddy have gone there since on a weekend evening.  They reported that the lazy atmosphere was gone, but that there was a fun, upbeat vibe they enjoyed.  He also tried the fried fish and said that it was overly breaded, but good.  

Young or old, if you want a rustic, mellow place to have lunch on a warm, summer day... this is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Under new ownership.  Some of the old reviews were about the old Sunset Harbor Bar and Grill.  Now, the wait staff is very fast to take your order and deliver your food.  The owners are very nice people.  The food is pretty good.  The lobster bisque is to die for.  The view is awesome and the outdoor bar is very nice.  I love to sit and have a drink and just stare out at the lake.  Very relaxing.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"From NYC where we are known to be hard to please!!  This place is awesome -- service excellent -- the atmosphere can't be beat... beautiful lake front experience-- food we had was very good -- stuck to a BLT and it was perfect!  Anyone giving this place a bad review has way too high expectations.   A great experience-- would highly recommend"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised how good the food was and that you had options to order other than deep fried fish.  We were there on Wednesday night on the deck and it was a perfect evening for a sunset even though we had a little rain. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First, this place is NOT on 2nd street per GPS. It's off of Prospect. If you come down 2nd street from downtown Fairport Harbor, take a left on Prospect at the stop sign, then right at the bottom of the street. This will take you down to the docks and the grill. That said, this place is a great find. I was in the area on business, so I don't know what the place used to be like. But, I really liked what I found. Awesome deck and the food was very good. Perfect spot on a sunny day like the day I visited."}
{"text":"Club sandwich, half was without lettuce&tomatoes. Other half was exciting because it did. Cold meats were grilled but not warm. Mayo in packets. Fries were tepid. Drinks in solo cups. 

4 wasps were furiously trying to escape the building through the glass, I empathized. Unimpressive meal for the cost. 

Beautiful view. Made the experience much nicer."}
{"text":"very nice casual dining on the water.  food was very good and prices very reasonalbe for waterfront dining.  the only downside is, you MUST use the valet parking, as there is no where else to park.  valet cost was $5 on a saturday night.  now, if your bill is over $50, you get your $5 back.  so not a bad deal there (although i still like parking my car myself!).

i ordered the mac & cheese with bacon & onions.  quite a deal for $10 because it is definitely good for 2 meals.  also ordered the sweet potato tater tots.  yummy !!!  my friend ordered the ribeye and was it was delicious.  

a good time was had by all.  i will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Took the family there for a late lunch on an overcast Sunday Labor Day Weekend.  The nuclear power plant off in the distance caught my wife's eye, but hey it was downwind.  Walked through a fun and casual bar area that could be at any beach (outside of the Hamptons). We sat out on a pier over the water and had a great meal.  Kids menu with grilled cheese and hamburger was great.  I had a Blue-nami burger that was cooked to perfection and the best burger I have had in years.  Wife had crab cakes and was pleased, not an easy feat.   With 2 beers all for $65 with tip you cannot beat it. Would love to just sit at the bar and watch a sunset there someday."}
{"text":"A glance at their website assures you they do not exist based on their online hipness quotient -- it's the food and the view, both of which are much better than expected. We ate their right before the main menu kicked back in and the chef made us the Lake Erie Perch dinner before it was officially available -- lightly breaded, delicious, generous portions. The red pepper bisque was good too. Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Nobody can cook at this spot. Worst service in Lake County. Total mismanagement. Best bet is to not bother."}
{"text":"You just don't want to be there when the shad come floating in. Rather pungent, that is when it is recommended to stay inside the building."}
{"text":"This my first review after 4 years on Yelp. No kids menu.  Everything we ordered was overpriced ($12 for a burger without fries?). App was sent back after one bite. Food was below average. 5 kids, 2 adults (1 had fries for dinner), 2 beers:  $70. Hey, great view though!  Won't go back...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and had a bad experience both times so I decided to review this place.

I'll start off with the positives:
- The location on the shore of Lake Erie is hard to beat on a nice summer day.  One of the only restaurants in Lake County with lakefront dining.
- The food is good, but not excellent

The Bad:
- My first time here, my wife and I showed up on a Sunday evening at around 7p.m. and wanted to eat dinner.  We were informed that the kitchen was too backed up and they were not taking any more food orders for the rest of the day.  Seriously!?  How does a restaurant expect to stay in business when they can't keep up with food orders on a Sunday night?
- We noticed some people did order food from the bartender, and a guy wearing a \"SECURITY\" shirt then proceeded to scold the bartender in front of all the patrons for doing this.  Very rude and unacceptable.
- The drink prices seemed kind of steep.  I think I remember around $8-9 each for watered down piña coladas.

- The second visit was underwhelming as well.  Again, we went on a Sunday evening, but showed up at 5:30 for fear they wouldn't be serving food after 7.
- We were told by the hostess to seat ourselves, and were then ignored for about 15 minutes before someone asked us for a drink order and gave us menus.
- We sat at a table outside and it was filthy with food scraps from previous diners.  No one ever cleaned the table even though it was clearly dirty.
- The worst part happened when we got our bill. I ordered a crab cake sandwich and subbed onion rings for the potato chips. My wife ordered a portobello sandwich and subbed cole slaw for potato chips.  We had three summer shandys total as well. Our bill after tax and tip was over $50! Upon further review, we were charged for the full appetizer/side order prices, not a substitution price.  I wouldn't have a huge problem with this, but I only got a handful of o-rings and it was a $6 up charge.  On top of it, I didn't receive the potato chips. My wife's cole slaw was a $3 up charge (for a small scoop).  So essentially I paid $18 for a crab cake sandwich with about 5 onion rings.  If you're going to charge me for a basket of onion rings, give me a basket of onion rings.  

I don't think I'll be going back to this place any time soon, and judging by how poorly this place is managed, I don't think they'll be in business much longer.  If I wanted expensive, mediocre, water front dining, I'll head over to Pickle Bills.

I'd give it one star if not for the great location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant today for dinner. My family and I ordered soup, mussel appetizers, and pop as a starter. The soup came out almost a half an hour late, cold. The waitress was apologetic saying that our order was behind a table of 10. I feel this was lousy service as we are paying customers too. We also ordered mussels, which came out 20 minutes later after the soup. They were very hot, but this held up our order of food which was sitting under the lamp. We saw it there. The food which were perch dinner and fish tacos came out all cold. Ice cold mashed instant potatoes too. Nothing tasted fresh. Our waitress went out for a smoke break and did not check back to see how the food was. We told her about the cold meal and she went to go check with management who said no to anything comped. This was poor customer service for $117. We will not eat at this restaurant again. If the locals think this is decent food, then they are not expecting much in quality food. You can't mess up mixed drink I guess. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere but lackluster service. 

We called for a reservation and they asked us in we would like inside or on the pier. After confirming details our party arrives only to be told they dont accept reservations. Not a huge deal and we were seated fairly quickly. Our server was scattered and a little rude. It was well over an hour to receive food and we were onlt attended to once everyone else had left. 

The food was ok, but not enough to make me want to go back after this experience."}
{"text":"Great place to dine on the water front. One of the only places to actually be on the water and have great food. I eat lunch here during the summer because of the relaxing atmosphere and great service. It's also a great place to just grab a beer or drink around the sunset hour."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal whilst catching up with an old friend. Dinner on the pier was a great setting. The bourbon salmon was fantastic...my wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"We just went for appies and drinks. We were seated fairly quickly but waited 10 minutes to even be noticed by a server. We went to the bar ourselves for our drinks. Their selection was limited and some items not served after 6:00 but it wasn't indicated on the menu. We ended up just ordering onion rings, they were okay. The view of the lake was great. That's all I can say!"}
{"text":"We took out of town guests on a head boat for a day of fishing and carried out a tradition of going to eat seafood afterwards.  I did some Yelp searching on the boat and chose Sunset Harbor sight unseen.  Good deal.  Called to make a reservation for 8 from the boat.  Cudos to Mary who I talked to at least three more times to delay our time.  Double cudos to our waitress who ran back and forth from the 2nd to the farthest table for the wants and needs of 8 people.  I bought the $40 appetizer and it was snarfed up so it must have been good.  We had everything from the prime rib to lobster bisque to a hamburger.  All was good.  But the reason you go there is for the sunset.  Wow!  Great photo opp!  On a busy night, like July 4th when we went, the parking sucks.  Drop off your elders and go park.  Bar, live music, etc."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant. The views are breath taking. Not to mention the most awesome Spinach AND Artichoke dip on the planet! I will return just for the dip."}
{"text":"cocktails were good but food was not.  menu said mixed greens and the salad was 100% iceburg lettuce, waitress argued with me about it when  i sent it back and then gave me a salad that was 70% iceburg.  Flatbread was just okay, would have been much better with more veggies.  Calamari was terrible.  i specifically asked if the dessert was house made.  the waitress said yes and it definitely was not.  They were out of many menu items, so many that there was an attached list to the menu, about 15 items that were not available."}
{"text":"I am updating this review because I was here on Sunday and the food has improved. Not only that, the chef actually sent me a message explaining what he was working on to improve the current menu. That says a lot in itself. Thank you chef Shawn for caring so much! I can't wait to come back and try some new menu items!"}
{"text":"We'd heard so many good things about this place. We just moved to Fairport and everyone said to come check out Sunset. They're all lies. This was the most expensive dive bar, crap food I've EVER had. And I've been to Detroit... sooooo...

Ever seen an episode of Chopped where someone sticks a burger patty on a plate with a melted candy bar and call it steak with mole sauce? And the judges tell them it's okay... but it's not really what you called it? That's what's happening here. Salmon Ceviche... false. Fish tacos... sort of. Mac and Cheese with lovster... Velveeta. Seriously. 2 of us cost over $60 with tip. All 4 diners it cost over $120. Don't. Do. It."}
{"text":"I can agree with Andy C.  Sunset Harbor Bar and Grille was disappointing and the check was even worse.  We both had a perch sandwich, and it was COLD.  My guess setting under the lights?  We were there at 5:30, not crowded on on Wednesday.  Of course the view of the lake was great but the food was truly awful.  I could have gone to McDonalds and at least had hot fish."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, especially if you are sitting on the deck by the water. Food is very good but prices are higher than average. Not easy to find but was worth it. Please note that it is a smoking restaurant but it's not a problem if you are not sitting by the bar.  Good visit."}
{"text":"New owners have turned this into a great outdoor summer bar. It is cleaned up and food is really good. Couldn't ask for better scenery. Nothing like in the past when it was a dump.  This is a gem"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this restaurant. I was there last fall and had a great experience with a few friends at the outdoor bar on the lower level. We were there for beers and light dinner. The shutters were rolled up, perfect service, perfect weather. This time around, not so much...

My boyfriend and I dined in the second level dining area, next to a huge bay window over-looking the marina and lake. The view was spectacular. However, the service was below mediocre...our server was pregnant, maybe having a bad day, maybe just a bad attitude overall, not sure. Also got to over-hear a lot of the servers personal drama about dating and baby-daddys. (Nobody wants to hear that crap when dining out!!!) No ambiance to the place! So, all that combined that is Huge turn-off #1. 

The food arrived fairly quickly. We started with the spinach artichoke dip and corn chips, which was very tasty, with nice presentation. Our meals came almost 5 minutes later, and we didn't get to finish the appetizer. I ordered the Lake Erie Perch (half) with the garlic parmesan fries. It was excellent, though Huge turn-off #2 was that is was served with some generic off-brand packaged tartar sauce! (C'mon guys...put a little effort into making a house tartar sauce and house salad dressings!!!) Same goes for the Steakhouse salad. The presentation was stunning, but came with a huge wonking pack of some generic off-brand Blue cheese dressing! That, in itself, is the deal breaker for me. If I do ever return to this restaurant, it will be to the outdoor bar on the lower level, only. The rest is over-rated."}
{"text":"Went to apply a few days ago and they were pretty nice. I called a couple of days later and asked them if they had had a chance to take a look at my application. I asked the guy if they looked at it yet and he said no. I then asked when I would hear from them. He moaned at me and hung up. I can't believe the a-hole hung up on me. I will forget about ever going there again. I'll save my money and go to Pickle Bills down the street."}
{"text":"Good wings!  It's hard to find wings this good outside of Buffalo.

The outdoor dining areas are great - just be careful to not let half your plate blow in to the Lake (can get windy!)

Service was pretty good - parking is weird and unintuitive but if you found this place you probably know where to park.  Gorgeous views of the water!"}
{"text":"Excellent lake front bar and grill. Laid back fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went with a friend over Memorial Day 2014. Arrived around 5:30p. Was not that busy, as most were drinking. It took OVER an hour and a half for them to make crab cakes and a chicken sandwich w/fries. At one point, the waitress informed us (after taking our orders) that the kitchen had even closed early. Uh, isn't this place suppose to be a grille/restaurant? Apparently, the owner owns other bars and appears more focused on drinks than food service. My diet coke was flat and not mixed right and when the chicken sandwich finally arrived it was cold. This place could do better if it had an expanded kitchen instead of putting all it's efforts into the bar areas. At the very least they could benefit from an outdoor grill for quicker food service. The clientele was a little rough and there were speed boats and jet skiers flying within feet of the seated pier area attempting to splash diners with water. Not only scary but dangerous. Thankfully, we received a discount on the food. Not sure if I'll be back.  **I would be wary of more glowing reviews on here. They may be embellishments of owners, staff and/or friends of this establishment. I've gone to this place twice and both times the service was spotty. Two stars - only for the great view."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law was in town and wanted to have a meal on Lake Erie. Seeing as how there are only two restaurants directly on Lake Erie we chose to go to Sunset Harbor. We arrive there approximately 3 o'clock and there was no way to get whatever table we wanted. Our server could not have been more cool as he was very prompt courteous and we received a lot of yes mam no mam which you don't see very often in the service industry. He did actually screw up my son's order of chicken wings but to no avail he was able to rush a second order out post haste. My mother-in-law was so impressed with the service the location and the food that she left an obscenely large tip. My only real feedback is that they need to pay attention to the decking and the tables as things are starting to get wobbly and out of place so call the maintenance man and get some work done there."}
{"text":"Such a fan! The best lake front atmosphere in Northeast Ohio and service is always great! Bring a sweater it can get breezy. Food was delicious and the drinks are definitely reasonably $$. Watch where you sit too as the lake can churn up and splash the pier or bar area. Definitely recommend for locals and visitors!"}
{"text":"Great location, right on the water.  The wings were crispy.  The mussels were good and plentiful.  The walleye dinner was delicious.  Mac-n-cheese was creamy and really tasty!"}
{"text":"The no-frills, where the locals go (full @ 6 on a Sunday evening) place for a diverse menu of fresh fish & seafood at very reasonable prices. Quantity options  abound (i.e., scallops as an appetizer, a dinner or a small plate). Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"My experience: Went during winter and it was freezing. There was only 1 person serving the food and cooking!!!Food was not good. 

The Good: The bar - nice if u wanna watch the sunset and drink."}
{"text":"Stopped in with our teenagers and friends. Hadn't been before. Waitress service was good.  Food took 45 minutes to come out which was very long considering it wasn't packed but it says so on the menu however, 3 other tables fed before us. Oh well. 
 Crab sandwich ..ok. Burger .. Ok.. Lobster bisque not very good. 
Mussels were actually rotten. We could smell them As they arrived at the table. 3 of us checked them out and I couldn't get the rotten smell off my fingers . Very disappointed they would even ATEMPT to serve them to us.  Waitress brought a sandwich to replace but that's it.  No discount or comp item. 
Nice atmosphere but would not go back except for just drinks.  Nice place to have drinks."}
{"text":"With this secret, little beachy bar and grill under new ownership, I feel it's time for an update.

Well, let me upgrade ya, Sunset Harbor Bar and Grille! 

My feelings about the deck, location and general atmosphere remain the same: a great place to spend a gorgeous summer day enjoying glorious lake views. But what isn't the same is the menu. It's a whole new experience, drinks and food considered. 

First of all, it was a Tuesday evening and this place was pretty packed! That's a great sign for dinners--meaning lots of people love to eat and hang out here. My family was seated inside this time around, since the wind off the lake was pretty chilly, still. The wine and beer selection has been upgraded with craft, local brews and some fancier sparkling and higher end grape selections added on. They still have their Barefoot Wines base menu, which isn't fancy, but still tolerable. Again, you're not coming here for the drink menu of a Michelin starred restaurant--amIright? Cool. I opted for a glass of the Apothic Red Blend (was pretty impressed they had this, although a popular selection), while my other dining compadres picked some Great Lakes Brewing pints. I found myself giggling a little when my vino came in a plastic cup that looked like a wine glass, but it added to the kitschy-vibe of this place. 

The food was the real surprise here--a major step up from the last ownership. The crab cakes tasted super-fresh, well seasoned and weren't meal-y/too bread-y. The roasted red pepper sauce that accompanied them was also a nice touch. My Dad ordered the fish tacos, but what came out were two HUGE pieces of perfectly seasoned and prepared fish, wrapped in warm flat breads and topped with yumminess. They looked almost like gyros, but with fish. My Dad's plate was completely cleaned--if that tells you anything. My Mom got an pretty delicious looking burger with sweet potato tots and she was super happy. And I was completely blown away by their handcut ribeye, served with asparagus. The seasoning was perfect, so was the seared crust on the outside and the perfectly cooked medium rare center. I'm drooling just thinking about it! I've had much crappier steaks at nicer restaurants and this one was only $18, served with two hearty sides. 

We'll definitely be coming back--but not just for the awesome views and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good Service. Relaxing Lakefront Dining. Prime Rib dinner was outstanding!i would recommend this place to friend"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lake view...food was fair.  I had the Cuban taco which had minimal flavor.  Just had pulled pork with beans and tomato.  Could have used a little more spices and salsa.  Atmosphere was fun as had a DJ who encouraged people to dance.  Overall, go for the view!!"}
{"text":"Service was atrocious and the waitresses were extremely rude. Never coming here again. I recommend you don't go through the headache that we had to."}
{"text":"Great location, although a bit difficult to find the drive down to the shoreline.   Beautiful view of the Fairport Harbor and light House.   The pub downstairs was half full, and looked to be lively.  The food was a B- quality, just good enough not to
be objectionable.  Quantity of food was good.  Interesting menu featuring local Fish like perch and walleye.  The staff was attentive, and checked back frequently.

Go for the great location and view on a nice day.   
The food will be wholesome, but not a top drawer
Eating experience."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the location is awesome but everything else was terrible. 

When we first got there, Sunday afternoon around 2, there was a line by the hostess stand but no hostess. We were third in line and people were piling in behind us. Everyone was just kind of standing there wondering what to do as servers just walked past not saying a word. Finally ten minutes later the woman finally appears and takes our names. I don't think this is that big a deal but I'll mention it, we waited about 20 minutes for a table despite them having tons of empty ones inside and out. 

So none of that bothered me too much but when you put it with the rest of our experience it just goes to show how little the people there care about their service because they know people will still go because of the location. 

We get sat and our waitress comes over and gets us waters, after that things went downhill. We ordered Cajun shrimp as our appetizer (pictured), after placing the order we didn't see our waitress again for 20 minutes when she realized we didn't have our appetizer and went to go find out what happened, 20 more minutes later she finally comes back and says the kitchen lost our ticket but she rushed it, we order our food. At this point I'm still giving this place the benefit of the doubt. 20 more minutes go by and we finally get our \"rushed\" appetizer, which is really just shrimp in Parmesan water and not Cajun shrimp at all. The waitress tells us it's really hot, at this point I tried returning it because I figured out food would be out soon and we only ordered the appetizer because we were really hungry but that was an hour ago. She told me our food would not be out soon so we took it. 

We didn't eat very much because it wasn't hot at all and was more on the verge of turning cold, and like I said, it wasn't Cajun shrimp, it was shrimp in Parmesan water. Our food comes out about 20 minutes after we got our appetizer and it wasn't bad. The fries were good, my crab cake burger didn't taste very fresh but it could have been worse. A little before getting our food we asked the waitress to refill our waters, she said okay and walked away without our cups. We didn't see her again until near the end of our meal, so we asked the girl who brought our food for water, she took our cups and we never saw her again. We ate basically our whole meal with no drinks. Also, after we got our food, which a food runner brought, our serving never stopped by to check on us even though we saw her walk by at least twice, that's serving 101. Near the end of our meal my boyfriend went to the bar to get us water since it was clear no one else was going to. When our server finally did come back we ask for our check, 20 minutes later we see her walk by to give another table their check and on her way back nodded in our direction indicating she had forgotten about us. We finally got our check paid and will not be returning again. 

I really try hard to not knit pick or get angry when I go out to eat, I served and understand things happen, but no one, including our server seemed to be apologetic about the blasé way this place was run. From the hostess who was MIA for over ten minutes while people walked up confused and hungry, to our serving never really addressing the fact she either forgot about us or just didn't have time to serve our table. She may have had a saving grace if she had taken that cold watery shrimp appetizer off our bill that we waited an hour for and barely ate, but she didn't even realize there was anything wrong with it. 

It's just disappointing that this place is run so poorly because the atmosphere and view is pretty cool. Maybe it would be a good bar spot but I don't recommend eating there. Anyway, maybe other people have had better experiences but this was our first time and I don't plan on having a second."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to this bar before, it's nothing like you remember.  Under new ownership, Sunset Harbor Bar and Grill is now a great place to grab a drink or five, have a good meal, and check out some amazing lake views.

Both the inside and the outside of Sunset Harbor Bar and Grille have been renovated.  I think the bathrooms are nicer than the one in my house.  There's a great brand new outdoor bar, plenty of picnic tables to sit on, and a rooftop deck is under construction.  They have a DJ on Saturdays and Sundays if you want to get your groove on, and they plan on having live entertainment (bands) throughout the summer.

The menu features standard American fare - everything from wings to crab cakes to burgers, and everything in between.  But there are a few vegetarian options, too.  

This place is really a hidden gem with some incredible lake views.  If you're looking for a place to hang out, relax, and have a nice meal or a couple drinks while watching the lake, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Hummus is usually served with pita, not a full plate of tortilla chips and a few flimsy carrots and celery."}
{"text":"What an unfortunately awful experience! No one acknowledged our table after we had been seated for 20 minutes. After finally getting our order of lobster and margharita flatbread, I would have rather just stuck to drinking out of their ridiculous red solo cups (plastic by the lake? Is that really a smart idea?). Both flatbreads were flavorless, soggy, and cold. Our waitress did not bother to return for our checks for another 20 minutes, and when we finally personally took our checks in ourselves, the staff member rolled her eyes as if this is something that happens quite often. 

No apology or offer to discount our meal. Frankly terrible service. We were there for almost two hours just for one drink and lousy flatbread. Do not bother!"}
{"text":"If you had a negative stars system available I would give them a -star. The only thing they have going for them is there location. I guess they feel being one of the only restaurants on the lake front, they can neglect their customers."}
{"text":"I never made it inside parking was such a disaster! No where to park and no one to direct you if there was parking around blue building. I was so frustrated that I just turned around by edge of dock and left! Looked nice, looked like I would enjoy it. Too bad the parking on a busy Saturday at 8:00 was such a joke."}
{"text":"Been a few times for appetizers and drinks after visiting nearby Headlands State Beach Park.    Good drink selection, great appetizers.  Great location on the water (the covered patio area and dock), beautiful sunsets.   Parking can be dicey and the entrance road through the marina bumpy.  Good service, fun to watch NFL games on Sunday nights.   Recommended."}
{"text":"Great little local spot with great food and friendly, prompt service.  This place has a definite 'local' feel.  All that being said the biggest compliment has to be for their food.  The food we had was delicious.. but the pepperoni roll... my word.. best pepperoni roll I've ever had.  Period.  I worked at a bakery growing up and have had many different kinds of pepperoni rolls.. but this place has the best ones I've ever tasted.  Flakey, full of TONS of cheese and sauce,  just the right amount of pepperoni... and the portion is huge.  If your looking for something other than the delicious fresh water fish.. try this thing.  It will blow your mind.  Great job outta this place."}
{"text":"I should have read my last review before we went there again. I do love the view and we had friends visiting and thought they would like it, they did. I know you pay extra for the menu items because of the view. But the view I could have done without was the line of people sitting on the wall between us and the water smoking two feet from our table. Pretty tacky. My burger was good, although it was well done not medium rare as I ordered it. And they charge you an extra $1 for cajun fries. They are not cajun fries, they are normal fries with a pinch of seasoning on top. Not tossed in the seasoning, I just don't understand this. Am I supposed to mix it in myself? So, stick to the food out of the fryer, enjoy the view, but don't expect too much from the kitchen and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"The location here is beautiful! It is right on the lake and the views are gorgeous. I think the location is really driving the 4 stars for me. There were the normal beer options (no craft) and the wine was Barefoot so nothing to write home about. 

I'm a vegetarian and there wasn't much on the menu for me. I ended up with their margarita pizza. It was good. My hubby got the strip. It was good but I thought it was a bit pricey ($24). 

It was hot on the day we went and there is NO air conditioning. All the seating are mostly outside. The upstairs patio is enclosed but no air. It was stifling. The breezes are nice and it was cloudy so it was nice outside. Overall, I would go again for drinks appetizers on a cooler day."}
{"text":"My wife and her friends had a similar experience as Mike G. She said the waitress were rude and actually argued with her about her order. The salad she got took forever and the cheeseburger came out when the rest of her friends were already almost done eating. Never go here!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, the first a couple years ago, and a much better experience.  First, I sat in my car for 15 minutes while a delivery truck blocked the parking lot.  I had a disabled person with me- and when asked why we didn't park in the other lot,  their response was \"oh, I guess that would be too far for you to walk\"   The food was poor. My sandwich didn't even have everything on it the menu said it would, neither did the salads. The kids tater tots didn't even taste good.  Don't waste your money.  The service was very slow. Will not return."}
{"text":"There's no better view in the area. We ate outside on a warm Tuesday night with beautiful views of the lake and marina. Our drinks  came out immediately, and our food was delivered to the table in 25 minutes by a cheerful, attentive waitress. They were fairly busy so we were surpised at how fast the service was. The owner asked us how our meal was on the way out, which is always a good sign. And the indoor/outdoor bar was full. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite \"let's go to the lake to eat\" spots! Whether it is a Friday/Saturday or Tuesday evening, this is one enjoyable spot. Great view since there is a pier that goes into the lake and you can eat on the pier. Not you liking...then go for the tables on the deck/patio area, still has that great view and sunsets are gorgeous! Also has an opened/covered bar area if you are just in the mood for refreshments.

Service is always top-notch and even on busy nights, you are not forgotten. Quick orders followed with quick service of dishes. Recommend the fish tacos; perch sandwich; and the burger; all served with hand cut, not frozen, fries!

Looking for a great spot of the beaten trail, here is one of my choices!  You won't be disappointed! But if you are, it's your fault!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great environment, perfect location, great owners, great staff, good food!"}
{"text":"After having some great reviews in the area on Yelp my wife and I explored Sunset Harbor Bar and Grill.  Needless to say we were completely disappointed.  We ordered a corn appetizer that tasted like a frozen prepared Sysco appetizer they just dropped in the oil basket. The waitress recommended the Lake Erie perch sandwich with fries or coleslaw. We figured we would order 1 with regular fries and 1 with sweet potato fries. And a side order of coleslaw to share. Surprisingly the fries with both good, the coleslaw was pretty much shredded cabbage with no dressing in it. By far the worst I've ever had. But none of this is why it received a 1 star. The \"signature\" fish sandwich I received was literally two fish sticks on a hamburger bun. Absolutely unacceptable and honestly I've had McDonald's fish sandwiches with better flavor. It wasn't good but for the price it was highway robbery. Also all their drinks are was plastic red solo cups. Yes plastic cups for a windy Lake Erie lakefront restaurant. You can only imagine how many plastic cups I seen litter our Lake that day.  You can look through every review I've ever made and see I have no said to stay clear of a restaurant...until now...avoid this place and going to some of the neighboring restaurants for better quality food and better pricing."}
