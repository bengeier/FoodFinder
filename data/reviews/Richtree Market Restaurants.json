{"text":"Unfortunately, Richtree Marche at the BCE place is NO MORE.  IT IS CLOSED UNTIL MOVENPICK CLEANS AND RE SETUPS THE FACILITY from its previous operator RICHTREE.

The legal dispute between Movenpick and its former operator Richtree way back had caused the Marche franchise to split its franchise in Canada between the Movenpick Marche and the Richtree Market Restaurants.  
The flagship located in the BCE Place was exceptionally nice for dates or out of town visitors who liked the idea, the deserts, the rosti, and most importantly the cozy ambiance in the streetview rooms or patio like open area in the front.

Unfortunately this venue just closed last week because Movenpick is returning to take full control of it.  So until Richtree finishes moving out and Movenpick cleaning and setting up Marche in BCE is closed for now.

Dissapointingly, Richtree website does not show any press releases and Movenpick website was down for the whole day so I dont have any estimated open dates.

Can anyone now tell me where to go get the fruit flans?  Or exquisite rosti with chicken?"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and made right before your eyes. You can see and smell all of the fresh ingredients while in the store. The home-made Cesar Salad is my all time favorite as their sauce is made from scratch. They have a variety of different foods as well but the only problem is that they are all a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat ever. They have every food you can think of. And they make it right in front of you....first went with my mom when I was a kid and I will take my family to experience this as well."}
{"text":"My friends took me here on my first visit to Toronto. 

At first I was so confused and overwhelmed by the concept. (we don't have these in socal) Seriously, I felt like Ulysses fending off the sirens except the chefs aren't singing, they're seducing your senses with the delicious smells and sounds of grilling meat. 

I ordered the Bouillabaisse. I regretted it a bit when the lady told me it would take 10 minutes to cook. but ohmygawd. so worth the wait! 

we also shared Fruit Flan, which was basically fresh fruit on top of sponge cake, with vanilla sauce on the side. It was still very delicious. 

I liked my experience so much I came back the next morning to try out their pastries. The strawberry danish is sooooooo good!

Definitely coming back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my sister's family. So that makes 4 adults, 4 kids and 1 newborn. So the odds of a quiet dinner are not naturally in our favour. Add to this,  a cafeteria style dining experience where YOU have to get your own food, wait in line to get the food, wait while they cook it and then get back.... repeat with each child as necessary. I hope you get the picture. Unless your kids are older and can be trusted to a open credit card (that basically what they give them), I would not highly recommend this. It is a little worrying if they lost the card as there is a fine.

I loved this place back when it was Movenpick, Marche or whatever, but have not had a good experience here for a while. The renovations are really nice and there is a nice atmosphere, which I feel the food does not delivery against.

Rosti
By far, one of our favs here, but we made the mistake of ordering it with the Pork Schnitzel. Boy, was it ever salty. Could barely finish it. It is also smaller now than before and more expensive.

Orange Juice
Fresh-squeezed! For an even better deal, ask for the pitcher size for $10 and it is enough for about 4 small glasses. I did find it strange that it was practically room temperature, however.

Kids-menu
This is a really good deal. For $10, a child gets a meal, a soda and a dessert. They have a quite a good choice for selecting the meal. For instance, they could get a plain rosti, a pasta dish with meat or a crepe with ham/cheese. The ice cream was a disaster to order. It's a long story, but little children are invisible to the servers as the ice cream bar is about 5 feet tall. Given they are busy, you need an adult to assist. I had a bad experience with the staff, but I am hoping it was a one off, so it is not worth repeating here.

Seafood curry pasta
Overall, tasty and spicy, but the \"seafood\" turned out to be about 99% fish. No shrimp or anything else. The one cool thing was they give you a buzzer so you can go back to your seat or go get something else.

Overall, not likely to return until I hear better review from my fellow Yelpers or other friends."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. The food quality really slipped in recent years. I tried some salads and pasta and both were bland. Sweets station selection really shrunk. I am not going to return there."}
{"text":"The place used to be a lot better and have way better options when it was a Mövenpick. Still, the food was good and service courteous."}
{"text":"This place is so up and down, you'd think it was built on a PogoBall (remember those?? I don't).

If I had reviewed this place during their Mövenpick heyday, I would've given it 5 stars. But a few years ago? Only 1 (it was really bad for a while). But I recently went back and was pleasantly surprised. Nice relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, and the food quality seemed to be on the rise again. 

But the best part? This place has the best crepes in the city. I usually go the mixed berries with chocolate sauce route, however they now also have a cherries option and it was to die for. Seriously. I would die for this. Add a scoop of their vanilla ice cream and loads of chocolate sauce and you will shoot yourself in the face it's so good - so be careful."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch with my children. I had the worse service match by terrible food!
The cashier made a mistake and under charged me by $1.00 on a cheese pizza. I was shocked that three staff members came by my table and interrogated me as I didn't notice that in error she under charged us by $1.00. I complained to a supervisor of the service who also seemed not to care. I've been a loyal customer for years... This is enough for me never to visit the restaurant again.
The food was aweful and my kids got sick. The rosti potato was burned and the pizza was greasy! Richtree has lost their ability to cook and serve!"}
{"text":"Pittoresque restaurant où l'on se sert sur des étalages de marché. 
Evitez les heures de repas, pour échapper à la forte affluence et aux files d'attentes. Ouvert à toutes heures. Prix moyen : 20EUR."}
{"text":"J'y ai aussi mangé (merci le routard ^^), et j'ai beaucoup aimé le concept (que j'avais déjà rencontré à Bangkok). A l'entrée on récupère une carte magnétique que l'on crédite à chaque fois que l'on prend un plat (ou boisson). On paie à la fin, en fonction de ce qu'on a mangé donc. Le choix est très large (poissons, viandes, cuisines du monde etc), et les prix corrects. J'y ai mangé un Pad-thai pour me rappeler la Thailande, et il était bien cuisiné. J'ai du payer dans les 10$, ce qui est raisonnable. Le service est sympa, et le cadre ressemble à un terrasse provençale ! 
Une bonne adresse à tester !"}
{"text":"This Open Market Richtree is completely different from the ones that I have experienced in other parts of Toronto.  I do not expect it to be in the food court, or just next to the food court.  It has its own seating area besides the food court. 

At 8p.m. when I walk in, there is cooked food lying on the counter.  All seem cold.  With my coupon, I decide to order a Rosti.  There is a pan of it ready on the stove.  It is burn.  So I refuse to have such a piece.  The chef just throws the whole Rosti into garbage. What I have in mind  Richtree is serving me something that is going into the garbage!  When I order the sausage on top, the chef shows me 2 cold burn sausages on the display.  I sure will not want them.  So I order the smoked salmon and I am given 2 pieces.  It costs me $9.49.  The soup is not hot enough.  In addition, we order meat ball pasta.

The chef is not keen on cooking and serving.  I saw the waitresses all seat together in one corner chatting.  Definitely this location I will not come back again.

One of us got diarrhea :("}
{"text":"I usually go here if I'm grab anything from the food court at the Promenade because it offers the greatest choice and healthiest options.

There is a wide variety of foods to choose from, Richtree layout is open market concept. Select your food on your tray from the various stations (sandwich, dessert, coffee, juice, bakery, roasted chicken, pasta, rosti, etc.)

My favorite food here is the rosti with sour cream, but the sandwiches have been decent choice as well. 

One thing I would advise, is not to buy close to end of the day. Turn over is low and things are not fresh at that time."}
{"text":"Went to Richtree for lunch of catching up with some high school besties. The fountain just outside the main entrance is an excellent meeting spot. It's a bit strange that there are no entrances from the street, right into the restaurant but just follow the arrows. We came in around 2 and chose a table in the pretty, yellow room. It had a reservation sign for 5 o'clock. We got a warning that in fact, the table was needed in three hours. Not a bid deal. 

We took a lap or two around the place together and then split up to address each of our hungers. This is kind of fun! Classy buffet. There's something for everyone. The displays and amount of choice is grand. I couldn't help but feel a bit bad that button mushrooms and other foods were \"decoratively\" strewn across counter tops for the sake of it.You'd better be using those mushrooms elsewhere, Richtree! 

I chose the seafood curry and it was ok-ish. It came with rice. I like to go around to other stalls and jazz up my meal with the condiments they offer for free. I added a lemon wedge, some green onions, even some roasted garlic on the side. The dish had a weird kick to it and was a bit too saucy however the seafood was cooked well. It turned out to be more than enough and I took home a dinner-sized portion. 

Anywho, I was really surprised with all the low reviews going down on Yelp until some management really got in the way of what could have been a lovely experience given my stellar company. Remember how we were warned about the 5 o'clock reservation? (Who reserves a table for four, 5 PM on a Sunday, at Richtree?) Halfway through our meals we look over and a manager is less than 10 feet away directing two servers on how to kick us out if we stay past 5. It was about 3, maybe 3:30 this point! She was pointing at us and looking me in the eye. We weren't even camping out! Someone came up to us again, to remind us that a reservation is an hour and a half away. We know. Kind of an uncomfortable way to end the meal. 

We left the table well before five. Service charge of twelve percent is included in the bill. You get candy on the way out! Nice."}
{"text":"Pizza. Cold. Burnt. Old. Tasteless."}
{"text":"Lots of great food options but poor service.  I was waiting and standing for service while the staff was wander around doing nothing.   Also the unfriendly staff  at the register was not pleasant and could be improved.   

I had the chicken curry noodles but it had too much grease which questions exactly how healthy is there food.   

I may not go back for the hot foods but the desserts/pastries are amazing."}
{"text":"Current name: Marché. A little expensive for a cafeteria. Tasty food. One of our party claimed the asparagus in the salad was \"a little moldy.\" The rösti and sausage was hearty and delicious. So was the cream of mushroom soup. Instructions for card use and traffic flow are not clear at all."}
{"text":"A long, long time ago I use to work for various Marche enterprises from Marchelinos to the fancier Marche in Yorkville where I was a bartender. It was a kinda crazy place to work at times but not bad, a lot of trickle down drama from the corporate level. Richtree is essentially Marche without the owners/shareholders paying for the Marche franchise name.

I've eaten about everything on the menu at one time or another. I came back to eat at this spot when looking for  some fast food and knowing that what was offered at the Richtree Market would be the freshest and healthiest option. I've had in recent times the Chicken Bami Goreng, the rosti and the coffee and muffin special. It was as good as I remembered it back in the day.

I still like the concept of having a wide variety of meals available all at one location. Too I'm pretty sure they still make just about everything on site from scratch. Prices can be a bit steep but then again you can easily spend $8 at McDonalds now and the food at Richtree is obviously far superior. As for freshness and quality consistency, it's pretty good from location to location, however I advise going during peek hours for the best results. Of particular note is the muffins which are awesome! Always moist and delicious. Coupled with a coffee (where the beans are ground per cup) for their $2 special it's a steal. 

Perhaps it's part due to nostalgia but there is still alot of things I like about the Richtree Market  when compared to other fast food offerings and so I give'm 4 stars as I am still a fan."}
{"text":"Best burger ever -- Ultimate Cheeseburger.  Delicious with fresh tasty individual components.  The fries are only an extra loonie, and including my drink I had a great lunch for around $12 including taxes.  The fries were quite salty which is exactly how I love them.  Delicious!

The burritos are huge and they offer you a takeout container since they are difficult to finish in one sitting.  The braised beef was yum.

What I love best about this new food option is the wonderful service.  Everyone is friendly and very helpful -- I hope this continues!"}
{"text":"The salmon bowl was a big let down. Soggy veggies and way too little quinoa and salmon. It's my 2nd time to the new richtree and I wont be back"}
{"text":"no one's mentioned the coffee/tea bar yet, so i'll rave about that.
along with the other market-style kiosks at richtree, there's also a little cafe that serves amazingly dark, rich, espresso-based beverages (and teas). each is made-to-order and i've never had a bad one yet. 
delicious end to a meal or though a bit slower than your typical take-out cup, it's so worth venturing through the \"market\" for a latte or americano."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Arrived pretty late in Toronto, around 11PM. Went with my family + extended family here, the place was bustling despite the time of day. The concept behind this restaurant is that you are handed a charge card as you walk in and get seated. You flip the card on your table to \"reserved\" and go to one of the food stations. There are steaks, sushi, fish, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, breakfast foods, crepes, waffles, a coffee stand, a bar etc. You order the food, they serve it to you and swipe your card. At the end of it all you hand your card to the checkout person and pay. In practice this works well. Don't lose your cards; it's $100 flat if you lose it.

Anyway, I was damned hungry. I got the rosti (basically hash browns) with smoked salmon. A pretty decent serving, and it was tasty. Very good combination. For seconds I had a crepe with warm chocolate sauce; the crepe was nice and big and well prepared. I finished it off with a (non-alcoholic) irish coffee that came in a huge mug. It was all pretty good but nothing mind blowing.

This is great for large groups because everybody can serve himself. The prices are a little high, but tolerable. If you need some food then you wouldn't be making a poor choice coming here. But chances are there are better in Toronto."}
{"text":"Probably the only restaurant in the Eaton Centre food court that has healthy options. There are many options for the herbivore.

Have you ever been to Marche? It is very similar and I wouldn't be surprised if they're a part of the same restaurant group. Richtree offers variety - baked goods, juices, pizza, pasta, Asian stir fry, and a whole lotta chicken dishes. The only problem is that none of them are really that good. Except for the juices - I enjoyed my mango juice."}
{"text":"Lots and lots and lots of variety of foods and desserts.  Think of it as a huge cafeteria/eatery place.  I'm not sure its worth the long wait in line."}
{"text":"i totally love this place just because it's got something for everyone.  it's a weird supermarket setup- glroified buffet, actually.  but it's got a variety of food for everyone and a desert section that is fun to stare at.  in fact the whole restaurant is rather nice to stare at and you never get bored.  great place to take out of town friends that have never seen this sort of place before and a great place to go at least once to try it out."}
{"text":"The apple cake is absolutely good as well as the chocolate cake if you fancy something a bit sweeter."}
{"text":"Richtree closed down some months back and the location has been reopened as Marché. Normally these two restaurants are a \"to-may-toe/to-mah-toe\" thing for me. I figured they have the exact same concept so it doesn't matter which one I go to. 

I've been here twice since it became Marché. The first time was a little while after they opened. I ordered a tomato pasta and it was bland. But I thought, it's their first week, I'll come back and they would've worked out the kinks and found the spice rack. 

Apparently the spice rack went with the Richtree name. I went Monday evening to pick up a quick meal and, if I hadn't paid for it, I would've thrown it in the bin. Same bland taste. The whole point of me buying food is my utter laziness of going home and making it myself after a long day at work. I shouldn't have to buy food AND season it. That's two steps! Anything more than 1 step is a recipe and that is in direct violation with my laziness. 

Maybe the other food options fare better. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Glad to add my visiting 'tourist' review. I waited in a gradually progressive line of 80 people to get in the restaurant. Its about 10am on a saturday morning. The atrium is scenic and the hum of the crowd patiently waiting in line brimming with excitement of their to-be orders help stem your excitement. As you gradually come closer to the front of the line, each adult is granted a Richtree card with an explanation that you should swipe at each and every station you have a plate from. 

With that we enter...and the place is like a breakfast/brunch/lunch/FOOD IS WHAT YOU LOVE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE/Themepark. Eggs are being flipped into the air, the smell of hash browns are overlapped by cinnamon roll french toast, overlapped by canadian bacon and sausage, overlapped by fruit bar, and then finally overlapped by coffee. Great coffee, and cappucinos, and bailey's cappucino's and a flat out bloody mary/mimosa/full-on bar. Basically whatever you need is being tipped out at you in no remorse, whether you want to try a full on heavenly egg/cheese/sausage/veggie cholesterol attack or a fried steak bliss or a french toast/ essence of orange liquer/canadian maple syrup - meeting of food to lips. If I could sit here all day, eat, chat, rest on a cot to resume eating again I would never leave this place. 

Your card will ring up quite a bit if you experience this place to the full, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken Stir Fry with Spicy Thai sauce - $8.  Comes with lots of fresh vegetables (carrots, cabbage, celery,  and onion) with your choice of rice or noodles.  I went with the noodles, and it was very good.  The noodles are big fat ones, similar to udon.  The chicken was pre-cooked and hardened (I think on purpose).  There's also a citrus sauce alternative.  

There seems to be something for everyone here.  Beside the stir fry station, there are many other stations including pizza, soup, salad, pasta, seafood, crepe, and pastry.  There was this beet salad that looked really good at the salad station.  Also, the pies and cakes at the pastry station were very tempting (chocolate pecan cake, Nepoleon, tiramisu, cheesecake, etc.)

16 oz lemonade - $3 - Good, but on the sweet side.  There was also fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice by the cashier.  All the plastic utensils are located by the checkout.

There's also a sign for daily specials by month.

Located in the Eaton center, closer to the Queen street entrance than Urban Eatery.  A good choice if you are short on time."}
{"text":"For the experience this was a great place to visit. Every section has it's own falvor and displays setup.
Wentthere twice with a group of folks from work and tried different cusines. It is a chain and usually packed so give yourself some extra time"}
{"text":"I walked in PHOTO ready until I was told by the Coffee/Bar staff that no photos were allowed. So instead I took photos of \"The Mall\" which Richtree happened to be a small part of. 

Unlike the MARKET concept elsewhere, this newest Richtree uses the Open Kitchen concept which in my vision seems almost Hell's Kitchen-like with the red tile back-splash and the stain-steel hoods and equipment along with glass sneeze guards/displays. 

The menu selection is fully shown on one of many LCD screens. From Pastry, Sandwich, Salad, Cafe, Breads, Oven, Pasta, Drinks, Ice Cream, and Rostii. Pretty much everything you would find in other Richtree locations. 

The Cafe/Bar area is pretty unique though if you observe from one of my Mall photos. There is also a TINY sofa area for only a selected few but it's nearby the freshly made Crepes stall. 

The seating area is pretty much the same as the Mall's except that there is almost a nonexistent divider wall of sort to give the idea of the seating being designated for Richtree customers. You can still walk freely in and out and sit wherever you want, nearby McDs or whatever. 

Senior's 20% discount which makes sense to attract that mall demographics during the morning/afternoon of weekdays. If you're new to Richtree, it is a Cafeteria style restaurant. 

I had the Fruit Flan($2.98) which is Richtree quality which means nothing bad to say about it. Fruit on top of Custard Cream on top of Cake. I had the Blueberry Lemonade($2.89) just to try it and it's not worth the value at all when I am reminded of Gatorade which cost less. 

This Richtree opens during mall hours which on weekends mean until 7pm meaning its not really considered a dinner destination unless your nightly routine is the Early Bird Specials which they don't have any."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Movenpick in a long time, so it was nice checking one out. However, the problems with these kinds of places immediately came up once I got there: a) lack of social, sit-down time. b) major indecisiveness. c) confusion about where to go, etc.

Having said that, it was a nice change of pace and I'm glad we went here before a Raptors game. We all got fed pretty well and left happy. Good for large groups."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Richtree, I believe it was called Marche - it's been a while. I don't know why I don't come more often, but I have a newly discovered love for this place.  

Just walking through the market and seeing all the different food stations brought me back to Las Vegas, only this isn't an All you Can Eat buffet. I mean I guess it could be, but you'd be racking up a pretty hefty bill.  They give you your food card, which is basically a credit card you give them when you find something you want to eat.  The prices on the food are clearly labeled, so you're never wondering how much something is. 

Pricewise, the food is decently priced. if you were to go to any restaurant downtown it would be comparable. The problem happens when you start ordering a different thing from each station.  They have salad bar, antipesto bar, stir fry station, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, meats, desserts etc. I got the salad bar plate, and piled my plate up with different types of salads. They had a wide selection (pasta, grains, couscous, potato, corn, carrot, greens etc). Everything was super tasty. My boyfriend got the quiche (pretty good, though he complained it could have used a little more salt) and we split a bruschetta (pretty good too, though you can't really screw it up).  

We topped everything off with a strawberry, banana, orange juice which I believe set us back $5 for a glass! pretty pricey, but it was alllll good! Our meal before tip cost $26, which I think is good for a dinner.  

Also a little tip, if you park in the parking underground, I believe it's $9 after 6PM, it's half price if you go eat at Marche. There's no signs outside, but there is a sign on the inside. I'm not sure if you have to eat a certain amount, it would make sense. But if you're legitimately eating, you should be fine!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  A buffet set up but with a la cart pricing on everything.  There's something for everyone for breakfast or lunch - I just can't see this as a dinner spot, but that's just my style and not really a reflection of their offering.  The layout is a little haphazard and not planned well, but the food is decent.  I loved the sweet crepes but wish they would have some savory options (ham, spinach and gruyere please?).   The smoothies are good too.  I've only been on the weekdays during breakfast and there's been no trouble with lines or waits."}
{"text":"Despite my rant about another Richtree location uptown, this place I actually liked. 

For those that are unfamiliar with Richtree, the way the system works is when you go in, you get a Richtree Card (similar to a credit card) and as you walk around the \"market\" to different food stands and buy your food, you hand them the card and they charge the food your ordered on it and at the end you give you card to the cashier when you're leaving and they tally your bill. Pretty cool dining experience.

They pretty much have food ranging from pizza to chicken to steak to sushi to random things and most of them are very good meals - and more importantly they're made fresh in front of you. The atmosphere of the place is really cool as they really tried to make it like a little outdoor market but your actually indoors (they planted trees inside that you can sit around, with patio furniture etc) . The place is clean and the servers are friendly and efficient. 

Their desserts however are reeaaalllyyy good and should definitely be tried and it makes for a great place to go for a gathering / business meeting / even a birthday party (they offered my friend a free cake when they found we came for his birthday) with a small group of people. 

If you are coming with a large group of people make sure you make reservations so they can set up a section for you guys otherwise you will be dispersed!

All in all this Richtree location provides a great dining experience with good food and great atmosphere so if you're in town or are waiting for your train to leave (since this is right across from Union Station) then it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars*

Stopped in here today - post bath and body works run - important to note when hungry, every thing is half price at the end of the day.  The universe is on my side...my tardiness today, let to saving a few bucks on a quick dinner.

There was a good mix of people scrounging for last minute daily delights.  Personally I dig the rosti - it was there, I'm sold.

They had a ton of dessert - the next time I'm in the mood for a half price cake, I'll be in...They also had some weird berry dessert concoction that people were buying.  I was out of time, so didn't ask...maybe next time."}
{"text":"When it comes to food in a mall it is pretty slim pickings. Everything around you is the usual large chain restaurants. What is one to do if they are not feeling for these types of fast food? Besides leaving the mall and eating at a restaurant, Richtree offers a great alternative to the typical mall food offerings. Pastas, fish, pizzas, stir fry, and latkas. Everything is served market style so you walk around, pick and choose then pay afterward. There are many other Richtrees around the Toronto area and I do deem this one to be the worst as it is very hit and miss pending on the time of day you come. If you happen to come at an off hour, much of the food is sitting under hotlamps and are simply not fresh and it shows in taste. Come at a good hour however, be prepared to line up outside as this place gets busy for the lunch hour.

Overall, probably the best food you can get in any food court but you go at an off hour you may find it better to skip it and go for some burgers. Prices here are a little steep for a food court but if you get it fresh, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Used to be Movenpick (sorry make that Mövenpick) and now re-branded as Richtree, which sounds like a brand of Asian instant coffee that's taken a faux Western name. Not sure why they went with the name change. The fear of the unnecessary umlaut in their name? I have a rule never read authors whose names I can't spell using a standard QWERTY keyboard (having to stop touching typing and access some alt+187 keypad combo just bugs me). S&oslash;, s&oslash;rry S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard! However, with restaurants, I tend to be the opposite. I tend to patronize restaurants whose names I'd have to fiddle with my Windows IME to spell.

Anyway, the name change confuses me and I'm still trying to catch up with Skydome being called Rogers Centre and Upper Volta being called Burkina Faso.

They've not changed the rosti at Richtree. Which is good. Rosti at Mövenpick made more sense but then sushi at Mövenpick made less sense. Then again, you probably need a home style beating if you go to Richtree or Mövenpick for sushi. 

They've recently switched to a card swipe system, no longer the little \"grocery list\" with the funky stamps. I'm sure kids are angry at this change.

Much of the rest has not changed since the Mövenpick days. The decor is still highly reminiscent of \"the village\" from the old The Prisoner TV show. A great, fun restaurant in general, especially if your parents are paying."}
{"text":"At the Brookfield Place location....

The good:

- tons of choices; anywhere from pasta that's fresh made right in front of you to pre-baked pasta to seafood soup
- tons of tables so the wait even on a Saturday night where there was a Leafs game going on was not long at all..and there were 6 of us..
- if you have kids, the atmosphere is really fun
- Rosti: famous potato pancakes; really yummy and fresh..you can also get it with sausages, pork loin, etc
- freshly squeezed orange juice
- in the heart of downtown so for a tourist it's good to go to after a long day
- the iced tea glasses are GINORMOUS!!!

The bad:

- the atmosphere is not the greatest for a date because it can get loud so conversation can be a little hard and it's not so intimate
- my baked pasta dish wasn't the greatest tasting; a little bland
- very very very yummy seafood paella is only available during lunch
- it can get a little crowded so sometimes trying to get food is a little annoying when there are so many people around

Overall, not too bad, not too fantastic...for three of us, 2 Rostis + 1 baked pasta dish + 1 beer + 2 iced teas: $36"}
{"text":"This place is heavenly.

It's located right in the mall food court and wasn't like any other food court restaurant I've ever seen.  The place was bustling with people and it's like a Whole Foods Market, but conveniently in the mall for you.  EVERYTHING is freshly made, the orange juice, lemonade, grapefruit juice, pasta, pizza, fruit cups, bakery, you name it.  The food is amazingly tasty as well, and the orange juice was sooo sweet, but the good, naturally, tasty sweet.  

For a place in the mall food court, it definitely deserves 5 stars.  I wish they would open here in Southern California (they're only in Ontario, Canada) - we need healthy places like these here!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and great deal in the morning, hot freshly baked muffin (I get the mixed berry  bran) and medium coffee for 2.29. It's really hot int there though and you have to sign for credit card chages...of 2.29."}
{"text":"This reminded me a lot of the now defunct Marche in Boston, MA - only a TON more expensive. I know that they need to make up the cost to pay their staff that clears the tables because this is not the type of place you leave a tip - especially since its self serve. 

I got a shrimp tempura roll, chocolate cheesecake and a beer...all for the low sum of, wait for it....$35. 

Not worth it."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon at the Promenade food court and decided to give OPEN KITCHENS by Richtree a try while the wife shopped.

I ordered the BBQ Quarter Chicken with stir-fry vegetables and roasted potatoes.  What can I tell you?  It was graded as the stars I gave it, \"A-OK\".  The chicken was juicy, skin a bit crispy and flavourful.  The bottom of the chicken was not as good.  It seems like they did not turn it over when cooking, or it got drenched by the sauce.  The potatoes were decently roasted.  The stir-fry veggies were a tad over done and mega oily and were a bit mushy, but hey, what would you expect from the food court?  

I did enjoy it anyway, but was still totally hungry afterwards.  Price was $6.98+tax.  Would I get it again?  Probably, if I do look at other options first of course."}
{"text":"This review is based out of their freshly squeezed drinks. I haven't tried anything else yet in their store.

I haven't been to Promenade in a long time, so I decided to stop by last weekend to see if anything new opened up. While shopping I started to feel thirsty, so I decided to stop by at the food court and noticed this lovely addition (yeah...I know it's been open for at least 4 years. It's been that long).

I've been to the one in Eaton Centre, so I kinda have the feel what to expect. I took the small orange juice in addition to a small lemonade. I know they are freshly squeezed and not from concentrate, so I'm getting the pureness of orange and lemon.

In terms of the taste, it wasn't anything special compared to the Eaton Centre, but I enjoyed it. I can definitely feel the healthiness of freshly squeezed juice, knowing I went here instead of going to McDonalds to buy pop or something.

A great addition to the Promenade food court overall."}
{"text":"I'd probably give a 2.5 rating if there was one.  I've been there a couple times - there is lots of selection which is nice, but none of the food is terribly impressive to me.  On my most recent visit I had Bami Goreng, which is noodles and chicken and stuff.  It has a bit of heat to it.  I also had the bread pudding for dessert.  It was a big serving but again there was nothing really special about it.  The two items combined came to about $12."}
{"text":"This was my first visit since the new look.

I had natures best veggie burger. I'm terms of flavor it wasn't bad. I really liked the buns and the tomatoes.  In terms of texture the veggie patty didn't have that bite you expect from a burger.  Certainly not natures best. 

One of the servers at the burger station had a huge attitude problem. One of the orders got mixed up and she got upset and just walked away. The guy on the grill had to assemble my burger in addition to grilling.

I also had a kambucha grapefruit ginger tea. It was pretty damn good. 

Although I wouldn't recommend the veggie burger I would come back to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Solid option in terms of variety and freshness in the culinary desert that is the Eaton Centre (other go-to places to grab'n'go: Cultures, Freshii). Some reliable standbys: rosti, bami goreng, pasta, and birchermuessli. 
Here's a tip: half an hour before the mall closes, they pack up all the remaining food and sell it for 1/2 off! Expect long lineups, but it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Marche/Richtree/Movenpick... I'm confused what to call it now. Whatever it is, the Brookfield Place location has recently reopened. 

It's pretty much the same thing, except stuff has all moved around. The seating areas has been revamped and looks a bit sleeker, but it's the same European bistro idea. Oh, and it seems the prices have increased slightly. 

I have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant. 

Love:
- Very convenient, right near Union Station
- Always open! I believe 365 days per year from 7am-2am
- Good variety of choices and ample seating area make it ideal for a mixed group of friends/picky eaters, also good for those with kids
- Always busy, ergo everything is pretty fresh
- The classics: their dessert crepes, swiss rosti, bakes pastas

Hate:
- Can feel claustrophobic when they're busy
- Feels like a tourist trap 
- They automatically add 12% tip if you dine in, even though you pick up your food and do everything yourself 
- Overpriced (e.g. $12 for a savoury vegetarian crepe with no side dish)
- They play really cheesy music 
- They took away the glasses and water fountains so you have to buy a drink
- They don't offer smoothies/juices by the half litre anymore"}
{"text":"Looking for a good place for a first date?  

This pseudo-European market-style restaurant has a great atmosphere where you can leave your table - not without making sure the paper plaque is flipped to 'reserved' - to stroll around as you flirt your way through your evening.  It's often busy here with happy people, including families; the chatty crowd, silky croony of bad love songs, mood lighting and the wacky decor would be an advantage to erase any tension or nervousness.  You really can't screw up a dinner date here!

But wait ... this is Yelp, not 'Dating in Toronto' 101 and we're reviewing food, right?  Sorry to disappoint, but it is a hit or miss and the prices are a bit steep for the portions that you get.  In the past, I found the vegetarian pizza here outstanding and on the next visit, antipasti that was less than satisfactory.  The most reliable dish for vegetarians is the potato rosti with sour cream; it hasn't changed in the last 10 years that I've ordered it, although the obvious fact is that THAT too is pretty hard to screw up.  

Bonus: There is WI-FI and newspapers if you just feel like hanging out and/or watching blind dates."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience here. I don't know if it was the wine or the food, but I paid for eating here for days."}
{"text":"This place leaves a lot to be desired. I know I shouldn't expect much out of a mall food court setting - but after my last meal here I said \"ugh, I should've got McDonalds\". I think I can end the review with that statement alone. 

... but I won't. I love the concept, really, I do. But the actual food is no greater in quality or nutrition than the rest of the food court. Plus, smaller portions and more expensive. I wish they had a Rich Tree seating area. The reason I gave Rich Tree multiple chances is because I didn't feel like the whole Eaton Centre food court \"experience\" (which is loud, cramped and dark). Once you have your food paid for from Rich Tree, you then enter into the mall realizing that just because you went through a cafeteria-style selection, does not mean you've been spared the food court. 

Anyways my last (and final) meal there consisted of bland pasta (that seemed to have been sitting around for hours) and a stale bun. Can't remember how much I paid, but it was too much."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Sunday.  I'm single (sob! ;-)) but was in a group of couples with kids.  Lots of buggies/strollers and toddlers to contend with.  There was a queue to get in but it moved fairly rapidly.  Once we got through the entrance, it was clear that this restaurant was perfect for our type of group.   Staff were very helpful and multiple high chairs were sourced.  The strollers were stored within minutes and adjoining tables found.  The older kids headed straight for the happy chaos of the play area and we went about the adventure of finding some food.

Like the other reviewers have said, this is an open restaurant with multiple stalls to choose from. You get a swipe card on arrival and use it when ordering your food.  There is lots of choice-all types of hot food, salads, pastries, sushi.  It was Easter Sunday and the last day of my trip so I made a beeline for the crepe bar.  Got a really yummy banana crepe with chocolate sauce and ice-cream.  Yum!  The other meals looked very tasty too and everyone seemed happy.  It's not Michelin star material but it's good...

It is expensive for what you get...but it's also fun and especially good for groups because there is a choice for absolutely everybody.  Would definitely go again-just wish it was a bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"Always safe, you know you'll find something you will like and great for young kids with amazing Stokke Tripp-trapp style castored high chairs.  Somehow though I always leave this place thinking I have paid about twice as much as I should have."}
{"text":"Convenient, clean and friendly staff

I generally have found this a good place.  A nice variety of food to suit everyone's tastes and great staff.

I went last week for lunch, although the prices were slightly higher than they should be (and on top of that they add a mandatory 12% tip) a cup of tea was $3.50 (with free hot water refills) a crepe with nutella is $9.99. 

I found the staff really friendly both at the booths and around the tables.  They came by right away to take away my tray and even brought me a take out container when I requested one, always smiling and seemed happy."}
{"text":"I did not feel like having McD's or other fast food chains in the mall, so I stopped by Richtree instead. At first I was skeptical as I thought ok my lunch will prob be too expensive... But the prices weren't bad at all. 

I have to say though, I nearly walked out without purchasing anything as I was standing there for nearly a min at the station and no one was able to serve me....Busy writing down something? When I was about to walk away the lady looked up and took my order =.='

There was a salad bar with many options & you can pack it and go! Soup, healthy fresh squeezed juice/smoothie, sandwiches, etc. I ended up getting a slice of mushroom w/ carmelized onions pizza. It was delicious and crunchy! Just the way I like it. Ended up splitting it w/ the hubs as it was too big for myself. I believe the total was under $4. 

Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is basically a serve yourself eatery with unique packaging.  You have the feel of being in some kind of festival or marketplace where you order your food and then sit down to eat.   

The food is decent and there is a wide selection from starters to dessert.  Most of the food is premade, though warmed up for you.  I found the servers somewhat cocky and unhelpful.

I would recommend you go here at least once for the experience."}
{"text":"Not a ton of selection at the salad bar but a great choice if you need to eat at the mall..tons of healthy choices!"}
{"text":"I ate at Movenpick in 1994 declared it my favorite meal of our trip to Toronto. I didn't return to Toronto until last year when I discovered Movenpick's had closed, but this year I found out when I visited that Rich Tree had some connection to the old Movenpick rosti brand. (What Movenpick was known for was rosti - essentially a Swiss potato pancake.) Either they bought them out or were just copying. Either way I was game.

Unlike Movenpick, which was a sit down restaurant, Rich Tree (this location anyway) is a buy-it-at-the-counter-and-take-it-elsewhere-to-eat-in-the-mall sort of place. They had a good selection of fresh and healthy-looking meal options (also some not so healthy-looking meal options). There were several different stations - pasta and hot entrees, soups, salads, and a big dessert counter. I got the cooked to order plain rosti ($3.98). They also had other versions with barbeque chicken and with sausage. They charged an extra 50 cents for sour cream, which was slightly bullshitty. (It's a potato pancake. You've gotta eat it with sour cream or apple sauce.)

It was a big portion but didn't seem like quite enough for lunch so I also got a cup of the lentil soup. I was told that the container I had chosen was a small but when I went to pay I found out it was a medium ($1.50 higher). I couldn't resist the peach juice ($2.50) so I got that as well. My seemingly cheap lunch, after tax, suddenly became $13.

The rosti looked and tasted more like hash browns than latkes. They were fine, but really, nothing special. The lentil soup was really, really bland. The peach juice was fine but again, nothing really special.

And so falls another great food memory when I've revisited it 15 years later."}
{"text":"Awesome choices and natural ingredients the cha burger is awesome. Friendly employees, enviro friend plates utensils. Easy express pay station allows you to avoid line ups at multiple stations. Not too pricey. Wifi and happy hour specials. Great addition as a good court."}
{"text":"I am pretty much a Richtree rotisserie chicken and soup kind of lunch guy--I can eat it everyday.  That's the thing about Richtree--they do the basics very well and very consistently.  And of course it's a much healther option than most of the alternatives.  Plus I only eat at my desk so it has to be take-out.  That said the portion size on the pastas is a little over the top.  And they could definitely add some more non-bread breakfast options.  Bottom line though is I am a fan!"}
{"text":"The less classy sounding Richtree, or Marche as it was originally known is a pretty decent place as far as open concept restaurants go.
Individuals are provided with \"cards\", which will serve as your personal bill, stamped at every location. Perfect for those who get carried away and also large groups who just want separate checks without confusion.

In terms of the food, you get an amazing variety of everything: large salad bar, smoothie bar, grilled meat, seafood, sushi station, bar.....so this makes for an ideal location to take some people you don't know very well!! 

My favorite choices include the pizza, salad bar, Rosti, and the quail dish from the grill! The desserts are also great and I like the fresh strawberry-fondue they have in the summer........and no there is nothing wrong with a guy enjoying strawberries, it means nothing!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that Richtree market is a solid destination if you're unsure of what you want to eat. They offer lots of variety through stations such as pasta, Italian, seafood, crepes etc. 

It's always decent quality and fresh to order. However, it can get busy during lunch so difficult to find a seat and also expensive. I would say that it's a place I'd like to go back to when I'm in town because of the quality of the food they offer here."}
{"text":"This Eaton Centre Richtree is Disappointing.

I was excited to learn that there is a Richtree inside the Eaton Centre.  I wasn't so excited after I tried it.

I ordered the gratin, which looked decent, but it wasn't so good.  The College Park Richtree is better, and the Marche by the Hockey Hall of Fame is even better."}
{"text":"Lots of food choices but mainly salads, coffee, muffins, and pasta. Nothing special. Everything is fresh but pricy for what you get. It's almost like an upscale cafeteria. There's so many desserts that you feel like you're in a candy shop. Great place for large groups. They give you a credit card like card when you go in. You order your food and they swipe the card and you show the cashier the card at the end. Good place for a quick snack or something light."}
{"text":"I have to say that Richtree Market Restaurant has the healthiest food options compare to other fast food place in the food court.

My Caprese Panini ($3.89) was sizable and reasonable priced. And the other sandwiches are all under $4. The nice lady have my panini heated up in the sandwich presser..

Why am I eating a meatless sandwich for lunch?"}
{"text":"Hello, Richtree. I'd like to introduce you to a couple friends of mine...Salt? Pepper? Spices? I don't believe you have ever met.

I know, cheesy joke. But seriously, I think any sort of salt product is banned from Richtree. And instead, they replace it with all sorts of creams and butters that have made my intestines cry on many occasions. I've honestly never tasted such bland food in my life. Bland, uninteresting, intestine-clogging food that does not make me feel good about eating it at all.

I used to get the Rosti or the daily pasta dish pretty often due to the reason of work proximity, and then I would have to grab a handful of salt packets to do the seasoning on my lunch break. If you like typical, boring, bland, unadventurous food, Richtree (Marché) is for you. If you like fresh, seasonal vegetables, with the perfect use of spice and minimal presence of grease, go somewhere else.

And the novelty of having your little scan card wears off pretty quick. Especially when you are feeling lazy and just want your food brought to you.

I'm actually in shock that people really like this place...Well, to each his/her own. But I stay far away from Richtree and tend to favour places with tastier food."}
{"text":"It's been a really, really long time since I came here.  Still in college, on spring break.  My friend (a local) brought us here and I was pretty fascinated.  I thought it was a pretty neat atmosphere, and yes, like a cafeteria, but I enjoyed myself.  There were so many choices!  I'm pretty sure I circled around numerous times before realizing what I wanted.  The food wasn't too bad.  Unfortunately, our final bill came out to be a lot higher than we had hoped...   good, fun experience though."}
{"text":"So, as I stated on my previous review, the Richtree location at the Promenade Shopping Centre has been closed down.  Yes!  I told you it was going to happen...it did.  I am sure my post had nothing to do with the fact it did happen, there are other locations, and yes, they are for sure better.  I haven't tried them, but they are busy and people look happy and the atmosphere is nice...when you don't have customer service, poorly managed team and everything looks bad...you aren't going to last.  Here is an excellent example."}
{"text":"If you are looking to make a quick getaway and/or minimize time actually sitting down at a meal (\"dining\" with assy business connection(s), blind date, need to get back to work)... OR you are an exhausted tourist, with or without kids, who just needs to eat something, THEN Richtree, with its cafeteria style set-up and better-quality-than-food-court provisions, may fit your needs.

Otherwise, you should steer clear.

FOOD - generally is not great although people who come here often generally have a SAFE dish they get most of the time (mine = grilled salmon with rice).  I like the coffee bar as well.

SERVICE - I dunno, how good are you at carrying your own food and getting your own drinks?  Seriously, watch when you get in line at a station with 6-8 or more people in line for food they have to prepare (eg. salmon) - it can take a while.

PRICE - way overpriced for what you get... and as a bonus, you are charged 15% for \"service\"... Oh you thought bonus for you?  Yeah, I meant bonus for them."}
{"text":"The change of names is a bit confusing.  I've eaten here when it was Marche Movenpick... then Richtree.... and this time I think it was called Marche.  The name changes as does the decor (slightly), but the concept and the quality stay the same, and that's what keeps me coming back.  In fact, no visit to Toronto (from Buffalo) feels complete without AT LEAST one visit to this place (whatever the heck it's called).

This time three of us had an early dinner before the theater.  Armed with our little plastic cards we set out to choose our meals....\"Remember when they were stamp cards?\", asks the \"old timer\".  Wandering and looking at the choices is part of the fun... but it's also a bit maddening because everything looks so darn good.  Pastas, pizzas, grilled meats, sushi, salads, crepes, sandwiches, desserts, rosti potatoes..... even a juice bar and a granola and cereal bar.  This place has EVERYTHING.... and honestly everything I've ever tried has been good.  

This time I decided on the salad bar.  $10.99 for a large plate (no refills).  Kinda pricey, but I'm good at loading up my plate.  The choices were quite good.... of course lettuce(s) and tomatoes and cucumbers... but also roasted Brussels sprouts and grilled sweet peppers and cauliflower salad and AMAZING (I had never had it before) spiced chunks of pumpkin.  I wished I could go back up for a few more pieces.

My dining companions' choices of tandoori spiced grilled half chicken with herbed mashed potatoes and pasta with sauteed veggies and lamb were both met with favorable comments.

The shared desserts of chocolate mousse cake and a Napoleon with vanilla sauce were quite good.  I was surprised to find slices of banana in the Napoleon, but the vanilla sauce was so good I could have licked the remaining little puddle of it right off the plate."}
{"text":"Bad. Tried the chicken gratin.

It gave me the impression of Marche, but Marche gets top marks!!"}
