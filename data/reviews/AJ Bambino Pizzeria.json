{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot give any stars for this place! I ordered the Philly steak wedgie based on the circular that reads, \"sauteed steak, onions, green peppers and mushrooms with lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and italian dressing\". This description fails to list CHEESE as an ingredient! I have a severe dairy allergy and praying that I do not need medical attention. You guys need to do a better job at listing ALL ingredients in your food."}
{"text":"We have always loved your pizza.  We have spread the word to all our neighbors.  But, your service lately is horrible.  We have all ordered pizza from you for a long time and have been long standing customers.  This will be all of your last orders from us and our neighbors.  Your delivery is terrible.  We ordered pizza at a non busy time at 4.  We just got it at 5:35.  The neighbors have all had the same experience and you have lost their business now too.  It is a shame you can't find reliable people to deliver your good pizza.  The pizza was cold and that really topped it off. A shame to continue to lose customers for not listening to your customers."}
{"text":"I like their breadsticks and manager always nice with me. Like this place. Also i tried margherita pizza the best thing i ate in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"My family and I just moved in to an apartment complex nearby.  Decided to order food for moving day. 
 Let's just say I was more than impressed.  We ordered a whole turkey hoagie and a whole steak hoagie and the taste was great and the hoagies were huge for the price. We also ordered a xl pizza, the sauce was perfect and my 4 year old loved it!!  Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Can you say greasy pizza and bread???!!!  We had to dab out pizza and breadsticks with paper towel to eat. :(.   I'd recommend going with another Moon pizza joint, for sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Moon township. Love the thick crust and unlike some other places, when I ask for extra sauce I get it. It's absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Steak hoagie good, but stay away from the so-called fresh cut fries.  We ordered them because the person on the phone said they were fresh cut.  I know what they look/taste like and theses were not!  They were frozen fries with the skins on.  Sorry, AJ, but there is a huge difference.  Also got the canoli.  Slightly soggy; I'm guessing from being defrosted from the freezer.  And two small gobs of ricotta stuffed in from each end, so there wasn't any in the middle."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in moon. I got the meatlovers pizza and it was unquestionably the pizza ive ever eaten. When i came in to pickup the pizza, the staff was very nice, and i got to see the employees handtossing the pizzas to order. Very clean restaurant and they are open very late on weekends, cant wait for that late night slice."}
{"text":"Only in town for the night and had their pizza and garlic Parmesan wings delivered to my hotel room. I wasn't expecting anything great, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Best pizza and wings I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best place I've eaten at in Pitts. Great service and the food is always fresh. They're open during the time folks crave pizza the most. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Our business ordered here for the first time. My beef is that this place is only 5 minutes up the road from us yet it took an hour and a half for our ordered to be delivered and our pizza and subs can be described as luke warm. I understand it was around lunch time but our food should have been at least delivered hot. Even though the pizza was good we probably will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Bambino's has the best NY style pizza, the wedding soup is homemade and is really good, the breadsticks + subs are good as well. The best deal is probably just a large pizza and breadsticks for $14.99. This place is little expensive compared to some of the competition but has one of the best pizzas in town."}
{"text":"Charged me $14 for a Gyro and fries. They charge $1 extra for credit card. Who does that? No drink included, and it was a carryout order. The food was fine, but I would recommend a cheaper food option for your Gyro meals. Everyone else charges under $10."}
{"text":"Had the steak salad... More like ground meat to me. They forgot the dressing and it took them over 30 min to return with it.... Not likely to eat here again"}
{"text":"I just moved up to the area and was looking to try out some new places and Bambinos is really close to where I am living so I decided to check it out. I figured I'd try to get an \"artisan\" pizza. In other words I wanted to get something other than a basic cheese or pepperoni pizza. 
The pizza I got was barbecue chicken and I thought it was pretty good. It took me a few minutes to place my carry out order because I was put on hold a few times but I assumed this was because they were busy. When I went to pick up the pizza and the staff was very friendly. Fuethermore, they were accurate with their times as to when the pizza would be ready."}
{"text":"Great service! When I walked in I was welcomed with a gentle greeting and attentiveness. 

I just ordered two slices due to having to be at the airport in 10 minutes, otherwise I would have ordered an entire pizza. 

The dough was amazing, we ate everything including the crust which is a rare occasion for us. 

The pizza wasn't spectacular but it's definitely something better than you would find at a mom and pop store in Los Angeles! 

All in all I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are great! My favorite is the traditional pizza and what ever topping my husband and I feel like that day (most of the time it's pepperoni and sausage). 
The salads here are served pittsburgh style (with French fries), steak and chicken salad is absolutely yummy with their ranch dressing. The pastas, I have only tried the frutti de mare and the chicken Alfredo and both were good, and as for dessert I tried their tiramisu which they give you a good portion of it. 
I only gave 4 stars because there have been a few times when I have waited longer for my order than what they quote of 40-45 minutes and that's pick up not delivery, however the people that work there are nice and I think the gentleman who I always see there is the owner (not sure) but whoever he is, he is always nice and pleasant.

A place definitely worth trying, yummy food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Fucking. Awful. Order pizza 47 minutes ago. N O T H I N G. Bad bad bad bad bad service"}
{"text":"Terrific food, but delivery drivers will steal from you by adding extra tips. 

I have been ordering from AJ Bambino for years. And I always give a 20% tip or better to delivery drivers. Yet a driver had the audacity to add an extra 3 dollar tip. This is some of the better Italian style food Moon Pa has to offer. But with this lack of integrity I will never eat or order from AJ Bambinos again. Integrity is the most important ingredient in my food."}
{"text":"This is the first place to make a margherita pizza that actually stands out. Their pizza sauce is tremendous and the prices are reasonable. If you're an airport worker or a college student, their extended hours are a plus. Seriously, try the margherita pizza once, you'll be back for more!"}
