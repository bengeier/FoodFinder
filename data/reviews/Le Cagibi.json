{"text":"First time at this place, and a really great experience. People here are really friendly, the food is great and the price is really good (4.25$ for a soup and 14$ a pichet of cider). If you are lucky, you will stumble upon on a show."}
{"text":"Dans le style vegetarien/cafe/decontracte !!!! il y fait bon vivre. J ai pris le wrap bbq = c etait malade et je ne suis pas vegetarien .....extra fromage conseillé pr le wrap. Et le staff est super chill et stylé"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est très sympa, on se sent à la maison et on peut venir y travailler pour des heures! Le menu est correcte mais le café n'est pas bon du tout. De plus, les tasses et les ustensiles ne me semblent pas très propres... 
Prix abordable. À essayer pour une petite immersion hypster... Mais pour les amoureux du vrai café, s'abstenir..."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's got delicious veg and vegan food and treats. Great chai lattes. Fun furniture. Booze. Free WiFi. It's a great place for doing some study or reading a book as well.

I haven't been to any of the shows yet, but they have live music in the back all the time."}
{"text":"Je suis passé devant lors d'une petite balade et je me suis
dis : tiens on doit être pas mal la dedans. Apres une longue balade dans
le froid je me suis donc décidé de me poser un peu ici. Certes tout semble
avoir été trouvé dans la rue concernant le mobilier mais c'est ce qui fait le
charme de l'endroit, aucune chaise n'est pareil, il y a des fauteuils, des
tables bien usées Malgré cela on est bien installé et il y a de la place entre
les gens. Lorsque j'étais là-bas j'ai cru comprendre que beaucoup était des
habitués qui venaient prendre un café/thé/chocolat en travaillant ou en
révisant. La population est assez variée et je vais éviter de catégoriser les
gens. Coté accueil rien à redire, le service a été souriant et
rapide (enfin pour la personne qui c'est occupé de moi car d'autres personnes à
l'arrière avaient moins le sourire. Sinon coté consommation j'ai pris un grand
chocolat chaud pour 4dollars donc ce n'est pas forcement excessif. Il y a aussi
de quoi manger que ce soi soupe, muffin ou autre mais je n'ai pas tenté vu que
j'avais déjà des Bagel de St Viateur. Il parait qu'il y a de temps en temps des
concerts ou des expos et je pense que ca doit être bien sympa dans ce cadre."}
{"text":"I like this place it reminds me of those amazing bars on Coldharbour Lane in Brixton. It is trendy, but in a nice way.  It is in a part of Montreal which is more than English speaking, it is almost part of Ontario. So if you are a Torontonian (or Londoner) lost in Montreal, this is the place to come. The food servings are small but not overpriced and it is nice food.  It is not so much a bar as a cafe. There is WiFi."}
{"text":"J'ai bien apprécié l'ambiance et le service était très sympathique. L'endroit est quand même assez grand et ce que j'ai préféré était leur café !"}
{"text":"Great indie shows on the weekend from all over Canada. Windigo was a great band I saw"}
{"text":"Belle surprise sur un coin de rue du Mile End. Ne pas se fier aux apparences. La nourriture végétarienne est cuisinée devant vous par de sympatiques cuisiniers et elle est excellente. Ils ont des alcools au menu. Il y a même une petite salle de spectacle à l'arrière. Un endroit bizarrement génial et sans chichi."}
{"text":"The food is good value and affordable and healthy but after finding a hair in my food last night I don't think I will be eating there again.The staff can be nice depending on who you get."}
{"text":"Alerte : ce café est l'un des endroits où j'aime le plus la sélection musicale!

Vous chercher le \" patient zéro \" de l'épidémie de cafés Hipsters dans le monde, vous ne tomberiez pas très loin au Cagibi. Les murs sont défraîchis. Le mobilier est craquant et dépareillé, tout en étant soigneusement vintage. Il y a même un classique banc d'église, cette fois bien en évidence. Le service est nonchalant, végétarien bio local, le look soigné et stylisé de Punky des serveurs, la mine bouffie et le regard des clients perdus dans leur lecture ou affairés à leur ordinateur, malgré tout dernier cri : tout vous rappelle le café du Cégep, la Beat Generation, San Fransisco ou une sorte de paix dans le monde. Dans le désordre. Et bien sûr, une sorte étrange de bourgeoisie. 

Si ce décorum tendance ne suffisait pas, le café au lait servi dans des tasses de grand-mère a un excellent bouquet, et le menu végétarien, que j'ai échantillonné à plusieurs reprises avec délectation, même si je ne suis pas végétarien, est excellent. L'endroit est situé dans un quartier d'ambiance artiste et multiculturelle, où vaquer en sandales l'été est l'apothéose du cool. C'est aussi tout près des bureau de la filiale de la compagnie française de jeux vidéo Ubisoft. Vous croiserez peut-être quelques codeurs au passage? 

Le cagibi offre des spectacles et organise des projections la plupart des soirs. Le vidéo clip \"Les étoiles filantes\" du groupe québécois Les cowboys fringants, a été partiellement  tourné dans ce café. Entrez par l'avant, ou par l'arrière, l'été. Les spectacles se donnent dans l'arrière-salle."}
{"text":"The food here is stellar & the staff are about as laid-back as you can get...they're not here to kiss anyone's ass and they really don't seem to care what anyone does including tip. There is an off-the-beaten-path bohemian feel to Cagibi. You can go here and watch movies on the wknd, play Jenga or hang w/ a friend & the music is always really good..sometimes there are shows and even old-school porn movies in the back room! It's the kind of place you can wander into & not feel pressure to drop 5 bucks on some hard-to-pronounce caffeinated concoction whipped-up by someone with floppy hair and cooler tattoos than you. They haven't obtained a bar license so even though they've got bands n whatnot you can't just order beer w/out food. Kind of inconvenient when you've already eaten & just want a bevvy on it's own. That being said it's still a good destination."}
{"text":"This spot has a very special place in my heart! There veggie burger and date square are incredible!! I appreciate that they close late and the staff are always pleasant. 
It's a cozy place .. It has the feel of a grandmothers house with a twist."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
Great not-so-little cafe in the Plateau. Veggie menu and good coffee. Lots of character/characters. Music in the back room from time to time. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Veggie burger. Delicious. Do it.

SERVICE NOTES
Laid back but mostly attentive staff. Sometimes it takes longer than you'd like to get a pint/coffee but you're not really bothered.

LOCATION NOTES
South corner of St Laurent and St Viateur. Street parking."}
{"text":"Cagibi is a perfectly lit place to have a quiet meal on a Saturday afternoon. The vibe is very relaxed and cozy. There are gorgeous floor to ceiling windows for the exterior of the shop and the seating is very kitsch and comfortable. My only complaint is for those studying/working that need wifi, this place's wifi has the speed of a single drip coming coalescing on the end of a tap waiting to fall into the sink. 

I would definitely come back for a vegan meal with friends and to perhaps do some readings sans laptop."}
{"text":"Found this little spot while wandering around mile end looking for a cafe to sketch and drink good coffee
It met all of the above requirements for sure! I got a quiet little table at the front window perfect for people watching and sketching. 
I also tried one of the daily sandwiches which was a little plain but was greatly helped by the addition of a provided pickle,  the salad was excellent if a little small, but at $4 I'm not complaining too hard. Next time I'm trying the much lauded veggie burger. 
The coffee was excellent as is the service, I'm left mostly to my own devices which I like. Overall a good Zone to eat, study or just chill"}
{"text":"Amis québécois veuillez me rappeler au bon souvenir de ce petit mais non moins charmant Cagibi. On passe le coin de la rue Saint-viateur et on s'exclame: Mais qu'est-ce que c'est? C'est chou!! Wouhha les superbes plantes! Oh le vieux fauteuil! Regarde il y a plein de livres!!! Ohhhpfff tu as vu le rayons gâteaux Mmmmh!! Des thés glacés!! Oh vas-y on y va?!!!On rentre et on adore! C'est le coup de foudre at first sight !! Un bar, salon de thé, petite restauration qui en a inspiré plus d'un mais qui reste the One et ce n'est pas après une dégustation de leur chili ou cookies que vous viendrez me contredire.
Si je vivais là, le Cagibi serait mon QGbi!!"}
{"text":"Aaaah quelle belle ambiance! ça c'est un bon café-bar original, on peut le dire! Chouette décoration et nourriture végétarienne intéressante à déguster!
On y retrouve quelques objets médicinal étant donné que la place est située dans un immeuble où se trouvait la Pharmacie Esperanza. Cela donne un cachet supplémentaire!
Accès wifi. Vous pourrez vous y rendre même pour travailler! Dis-je à une période de l'année où les établissements scolaires sont en vacances ou presque ;)"}
{"text":"I moved to the Mile End in 2009, and was looking for a spot where I could eat good muffins and write. 

A good muffin is hard to come by, especially a healthy one, but the ones at Le Cagibi are the best I've ever had in my life. Their not cakey and a bit more healthy than the run of the mill kind you'll get at generic places such as Tim Hortons. They are vegan (i.e. no dairy or eggs) and they change everyday. They'll be strawberry chocolate one day or pineapple coconut the next. Not feeling it? Don't worry. They have an all vegetarian menu (they can veganize most things), they offer comfort foods and tasty sandwiches made fresh. They always have a soup of the day.

I've tried almost everything on their menu (I'm a big fan) and would say their burritos are some of the best in the city. They tend to remix it everyday. I once asked to skip the eggs on their breakfast burrito and they added sweet potato (winning!). Their Morning Rumble is pretty amazing as well, and I'm never disappointed in their quesadillas. They also have great chilli. Open late, they also serve up tasty eats late into the night. 

Sometimes they host bands (I've never been) which I'm sure can be a good time. They do have a liquor license but you need to eat in order to drink.

The atmosphere is really chill, some get put off by their mismatching chairs and tables  but it adds to the charm. The staff is friendly and assertive. Needless to say, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"N'hésitez pas à entrer dans ce café/resto malgré la rangée de personnes seules les yeux rivés sur leurs ordinateurs à l'entrée! 
Oui comme tous les cafés avec prises électriques et wifi de Montréal (et du monde?), le cagibi est pris d'assaut par cette masse de consommateurs de café solitaire et obnubilée par leurs écrans! 
Bref, cela étant dit, j'ai adoré mon passage au cagibi. Le menu fait salivé en théorie comme en pratique. Mon burritos végétalien était un délice, le tofu finement mariné et le tout très copieux! Les desserts sont aussi très bons. 
Il y a une salle à l'arrière où ont lieu régulièrement des spectacles, une bonne idée de sortie!"}
{"text":"I happened in here on a friends recommendation and boy was I not let down. It makes me feel like I am back in Williamsburg Brooklyn. With an extensive vegan menu,  you have much to choose from with out your inner carnivore hating you. I had the grilled cheese with pesto and the rumble! Both very light dishes (my friend and I split both) and did not leave you feeling hungry. Do avoid the chai tea...

I will definitely return here on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Café végétarien anglophone et grunge. Tout est bon et souvent surprenant. Les arômes de leurs thés glacés sont particulièrement réussies. Le brunch est franchement pas cher et fait avec amour.

Le décor est brouillon mais cohérent à sa manière et très accueillant. 

Pas de climatisation. Pas facile à chauffer en hiver. Cash only."}
{"text":"A great place to get a good coffee and a veggie sandwich while browsing the web, on your lunchtime. It's quite inexpensive and you're going to get something simple and good. Yum! 

Like everyone else said, it's \"hipster mecca\", so you better not mind the tight jeans and big glasses. ;-) I'm no hipster, but I do enjoy the look and feel. 

I usually go during the lunchtime and the service have always been very good. Althought some friends of mine said you can't be served in french sometimes, it never happened to me. The employees usually speaks both language, or at least a little bit of french. 

I've never been to their show during the evening, but I think it's quite cool that they offer a scene for local musicians. 

Only complain would be that's the place itself may look a little unclean. A little dusting, once in awhile, wouldn't be too much asking, especially that it's a coffee place. Last time I went, that was my feeling of it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafés in the Mile End. The cool shabby vibe just feels good. Good coffees, decent food. Plenty of space. Good music."}
{"text":"I think I just found my go-to restaurant for when I don't know where to eat for lunch. The food is really good and the price are also good. Yesterday I had the quesadillas with the salad. So good. The cheese was perfectly melted. Today i had the half sandwhich and salad. Was really impressed. For 7$ TX included you get a good salad (today was greek) and a half sandwhich that was actually bigger than expected. It was egg salad with cheese"}
{"text":"Wasn't planning on going here, but stopped in on a whim. It's rustic but apparently trendy since our party of four had a tough time finding a table. Ordered the nachos and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was the best plate of nachos we'd ever had--loaded with fresh ingredients and layered to perfection. Great espresso too. Doesn't look like much, but highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.
One of the best cappuccinos I've had, and also THE best veggie burger. Great environment to just chill, catch up and even get some essays written! ;)"}
{"text":"Vegan and queer friendly rad café with charming flea market decor. Tasty and generous burito and satisfying taco. Good pastries as well. If you need some laptop time this is one of the only hip cafés that is open until midnight. There are often live shows in backroom. The soups are hit or bust so make sure to ask for a taste before you order one. 
Tip: very affordable lunch combos.
Notice: It's closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I definitely want to come back for a show, because it's a good spot. But I think it's a sign I'm getting old, that the first thing I thought when I sat down was \"Man, I would trade all the cachet in this place for a chair and table that don't wobble... For that I'm taking off a star, because everything seemed to be ever so slightly in the process of decay... Which made it kind of surprising that the food and drink were SO DELICIOUS.  Definitely a cool spot for cheap veggie fare, and you know I love that. Also, it's just a stellar location, that corner in Mile End? Fuhgettaboutit..."}
{"text":"They have wireless. They have booz. They have veggie food. They have woodfloors, tall big windows. They have shows. 

But there's something wrong about this place. 
I think there's no soul."}
{"text":"Cagibi is SO over-rated.

OK I love the look of the place (they get 2 stars for that), I like how it's all cosy, it makes me feel at home (which is like 2 meters away...)  But there's nothing special about their menu. If at least the coffee was good I would totally join the local hipsters with my mac book pro. But yeah, no. Nothing special about the food too, there are better vegetarian food in the neighborhood. And I find it expensive for what it is.

So hey what's the point?"}
{"text":"J'ai d'abord été charmée par le décor chaleureux et vintage. La sélection musical est parfaite et j'ai finalement été conquise par mon repas délicieu et super abordable!"}
{"text":"This happens to be THE BEST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT I have ever been to. I was expecting average and got amazing. I ordered the special of the day; a good sized sandwich on baguette with cheese, some amazing vegetarian pate and shredded beat. Really now, if I could eat like this all the time, my struggle to become vegetarian would become a delight.

On the side, I had an ample serving of delicious tofu and broccoli salad. I don't know how they grilled the tofu to give it such amazing flavour, but dang it was hearty and tasty!

All this for amazing $6 with tax. 

The place itself is very relaxed, definite hipster vibe but in an inviting way. We easily found a table towards the back where its more quiet (sorry for disrupting it with our chatting)."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the ambiance, the chai latté. Always felt good coming here since the time it was Café Esperanza, brought a number of friends here several times and they all loved it as well. Only ate here once though, liked what I had, can't really comment on most of the cusine. Find the baked goods to be a bit pricey and not very impressive overall, but their teas make up for it. My friends tell me I keep coming back like a homing pigeon.... I like the place so much! I'll try the famous \"remedy\"when the weather gets chilly and I'm feeling under the weather."}
{"text":"La bouffe et le café sont délicieux (avec options de laits végétaux pour les boissons! Yes!), l'espace est agréable, la déco est dans l'esprit du quartier. Je m'y suis rendue vers 8pm (ish), donc c'était assez calme. Le seul down serait qu'à partir d'un moment la musique mise par les employés était un peu forte. Mais à part ça, rien à redire. Je le conseillerai clairement à mes amis."}
{"text":"Eclectic hipster vibe, great vegan menu, the music venue in the back is awesome. Definitely don't come here to study though -- the wifi is too slow to load anything but simple webpages."}
{"text":"Retro thrift store aesthetic meets indie backroom music show stage meets alt food scene, all wrapped up in a resto-café. I've been here just a few times and it gets just above a 'meh' rating from me. None of the food I've had here is remarkable in any sense, though I do like very much that it's a health-conscious menu. To qualify, I haven't had a full meal: just lattés, tacos and treats. I tried an iced tea, which was watered down so as to not have much flavour at all, but my friend liked it fine. She drank my iced tea and bought me a chai latté instead, which was honestly still just... meh. My date square treat was also nothing special, taste-wise. However, I will report that my friend's goat cheese sammie was very tasty according to her. So, seems it's a bit hit and miss. 
The music is LOUD. 
The seating is eclectic but comfortable enough, and you're definitely welcome to hang out with your laptop for all eternity. 
Ultimately, it wouldn't be my first pick for places to meet and chow down, but I did catch a really fantastic music show there one night, so I'd go back for another sometime."}
{"text":"At the corner of St. Laurent and St. Viateur hang out. If Anthropologie had a coffeehouse, this would be it. Effortlessly shabby chic, including gilded chairs with springs hanging out the bottom, mix-n-match chairs and retro tables make a most endearing space. The eclectic crew makes some excellent espresso drinks and the menu leans towards healthy. The clientele caress and focus on their laptops while looking fab. No need for a sign or even business cards: Cajibi is a place I could while away the day."}
{"text":"Cozy cafe, decent coffee and food. Not the best cafe but it's a decent venue for shows."}
{"text":"La deco et la musique sont très sympa. C'est très chaleureux et rustique,  parfait pour un bon chocolat chaud"}
{"text":"Played a gig here today. Pretty hipstertastic, but the food is excellent and they took good care of us. If it weren't so pricey I'd go there all the time. Food is kinda like Lola Rosa in the McGill ghetto, if you've been there. Recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food, great service, great and charming atmosphere. Also love supporting small businesses, especially after hearing they're moving to a cooperative style business model. Great for studying or reading, having lunch or getting coffee"}
{"text":"Decent place, understandably busy on a Saturday night but patient with hungry customers. Vegetarian yet satisfying menu, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Très sympa café avec pleins de bons choix végétariens voir végétaliens.
Les portions étaient plus que costauds, on avait pris des desserts en plus et on était plus que ras bord à la fin :)
Ce que nous avons mangé était très bon et je reviendrais sans hésiter !"}
{"text":"What a WEIRD experience this place was. We went here to see a concert and wanted to grab a couple of drinks. Well you can't drink unless you buy food. And each person has to buy food at least once. And the food can't be a dessert. HUH? The food was GREAT. Really liked the taco and the potato salad. Asked what was in the salad and the girl said she'd find out and never saw her again. Glad I had cash because no credit cards accepted here. Everyone working here seemed spaced out and kind of weird. I asked the guy \"parlez vous anglais\" and he snapped \"yes of course\". Of course nothing because there are plenty of places in Quebec where I've had to subject innocent people to my horrible French and they lived. Later when we asked for the wifi password he just shrugged and said \"I don't use computers so I don't know what to say. Good luck!\"  Uhm ok...

Pros: Excellent food
Cons: Indifferent staff, no wifi, cash only"}
{"text":"Wow, an update 7 years later! We are old, my friends. But Cagibi is looking shiny and new, and I'm so happy it seems to have brought it's true heart up a couple blocks North to this new spot across the street from Vices Versa. I'm also happy they brought the vintage pharmacy shelves with them, salvaging them from the tragic gutting of the old location! 

Much remains the same: filling and inexpensive vegan and vegetarian food, a couple beers on tap, delicious smoothies and juices, a family vibe. The café has shifted to a coop model which hopefully is a nice experience for the team making the magic happen. 

I didn't find out if they will still be able to have live music in this location, but the layout would work and is definitely conducive to readings and talks, and of course to relaxed study, reading a good book, lunch with friends."}
{"text":"This is feel good vibe coffee shop. We arrived around 530pm on a Thursday and it was completely  crowded.
We found a empty table in the back of the place. There is a sort of stage for shows. The cashier was fine not specially friend (probably not canadian). They have coffee and food. Some people were just there with there friends some were reading a book some were watching tv shows on their phone. There were mostly young people/students. This place was recommended by one of my friend a long time ago. It is probably the coffee shop that has the most similar vibez than the one in Friends ."}

{"text":"Very good food, super helpful staff (I don't speak French, but the barista was happy to walk me through the menu.), nice atmosphere (quirky and hip). If I lived in Montreal, I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"Le Cagibi transports you back to the 70's or 80's with its super vintage atmosphere. Everything from the posters to the tables to the coffee cups are vintage, seemingly collected over the years by a sweet and loving granny who can still see soul and beauty in the simplicity. Perfect place to just do nothing and hang out. 

Love the staff here, super cool. Friendly and pretty, what more can you ask for?

The missing star is for the coffee. The coffee could use a little improvement, compared to the gazillions of amazing coffee shops in Montreal. The espresso in the latte could be more flavourful, and the latte itself could be just a tad bit less hot."}
{"text":"Le Cagibi, to this New Yorker, is plucked right out of the fantasy I have in my mind of the 1990's East Village. No where in Brooklyn's deepest reaches today can quite match the  shabby-chic design of this gay-veggie-café-cum-music venue in its idiosyncrasy. It fits all of the stereotypes you might imagine...complete with the tattooed, crop-cut staff,  and Macbooking, granola chomping patrons. Yes, I swing this way from time to time, and, shamelessly, I do feel at home here. We had the salade/chili combo thing, and it was really good - much much better than I even expected. The coffee, served in charming as hell Corian china, was also up to par. I wish they had some outdoor seating, and the place was really quiet for the few hours I whiled away there on a weekday afternoon. I am sure that it is a dynamite evening spot, as they are open way late and have live music almost every night. You also can pick up all your alternative lifestyle ads/flyers/magazines and find out where the next San Francisco Lesbian Punk Rock concert is going to be. Essential knowledge, for sure."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place, however was disappointed. The cafe section was sort of dirty and gross, and the staff were rude. I ordered \"the trio\" and got food poisoning that night! Me and my friend came here to see the music, and it was horrible! Can't even describe the first act, and the second wasn't good either."}
{"text":"If the feelings I have toward the fine city of Montreal were to be epitomized by one place, Cagibi would be it. Cozy, friendly, serving of both coffee and wine -- this is the best work spot, the best meeting spot, the best, no-fail joint to bring just about anyone for any reason. 

This is what I imagine my home might look like if I decided to open it up to hip mile-end students and artists, musicians and poets, lovers and writers. Books lining the walls, chairs worn to a familiar shape, blackboards that aren't purposefully placed \"just so\" but are rather \"just so\" because they are. Spend an afternoon, enjoy an evening, come back again and again. Live music, comfort food, essential Montreal."}
{"text":"Another mile-end institution. This place was called Cafe Esperenza and before that it used to be  a pharmacy (some remnants of the pharmacy decor lingers if you notice carefully)

I am huge fan of their vege chilli's, I am not vegetarian per se but i do like good food and that chilli is hella good!

No bar license means you have to buy food, though it also doubles as a venue, so not sure how them logistics work! Tried their rice and beans bowl and that too has won me over. Wasnt so sure about the Taco (a single taco) but eye of the beholder right?

Not sure if its a new feature but their brunch menu has eggs, dont remember seeing that on previous visits."}
{"text":"Went here once for some cider, a $1 taco and to watch a show. Pretty cool joint. Same idea as Casa, but there's wifi so you get the Macbook crowd, and also it's a bit pricier so it leans more towards yuppiedom rather than hipsterdom, if that makes sense. 

Cool place. I'd go to Cagibi if I wanted a quieter version of what's offered at Casa, basically."}
{"text":"Fabulous casual spot for sandwiches and salads and beers and coffees. Great music plays on the radio and the staff is really friendly. Free Wifi. I just discovered the place and have been back a few times already."}
{"text":"my bf and I had dinner with a burrito and a quesadilla, and they were pretty good. The place is very nice, crowded but nice. and my cafè au lait amandes was very good!"}
{"text":"Opens till late. Best place if you want to escape the cold on a very chilly winter night. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Last week, after an arctic adventure throughout Montreal, I was brought to Cagibi for dinner and to warm up, as it was literally down the street from my friend's apartment. I initially did not know what to expect when having Cagibi described to me, but I was immediately charmed by this cozy little nook. 
This is like- the dreamy epitome of an indie coffeeshop. The type of shit you'd seen in Portlandia, sans Fred Armisen unfortunately. I don't really think it's fair to knock this place on Yelp just because it and its patrons are quite obviously hipper than you haha. 
I was swayed by my lovely dining partner into trying the BBQ tofu wrap and it's probably the best decision I made all week. I also enjoyed a chai latte with soy milk made right- no sugary syrups- just masala black tea and soy milk. 
While a squishy little place, we managed to find space to sit. The walls are lined with vintage collectibles, and I was told by the aforementioned dining partner that he has seen numerous awesome little indie shows here. I wish I hadn't been so full following my dinner, I would have totally tried some of the cute little baked goods. 
Cutest vegan friendly cafe ever. Don't let anyone tell you any different."}
{"text":"Le cagibi est endroit super pour les végétariens/végétaliens car non seulement on y trouve plusieurs plats de ce type, mais cela ne s'arrête pas là puisqu'il en va de même pour plusieurs boissons (bières et cocktails) ainsi que pour des pâtisseries et desserts. 
J'ai personnellement goûté le burger végé et c'était un véritable régal avec son pain aux olives et son énorme salade. C'était tout simplement délicieux ! 
De plus, l'endroit est vraiment chouette, dans un style un peu kitch. 
Pas de doute, je vais y retourner !"}
{"text":"La déco est sympa, la musique aussi, pour autant ces facteurs suffisent-ils à oublier l'antipathie avérée du personnel et la nourriture moyenne ? Personnellement, non.

The place looks nice, so is the music, but is that enough to get over unfriendly staff and average food? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Overrated. Skip this place if you're looking for good veggie food. Go to Waverly across the street instead."}
{"text":"Love the spot. Not too far from le Plateau, close to métro Laurier and bike routes.

Very large and calm rooms with cool music where you can enjoy the best mocha possible while doing your business, reading a book or getting your tweets sorted out.

Love all the plants, the wooden feel and fresh, light food that is always a delight to savour. Probably my best spot for a pause or for work."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed by this spot. I'm discovering that Montreal is full of small hipster bohemian cafés, just oozing character and ironic shabby-chic décor. You know the kind, where it wants you to feel like whole place just tumbled out of your kooky aunt's junk room, where no two chairs or teacups match...except you can just feel that everything has been so meticulously curated, from the hippest curio shoppes? And where somehow end up facing a $35 bill after a coffee and a light, if delicious and artisinally prepared lunch? 

After running into so many places like that in town, I was so pleasantly surprised by Le Cagibi - because of its lack of pretense, and lack of crazily inflated prices. This is, dare I say it, the \"real thing.\" The folks working here are warm and friendly, the food is amazing and cheap, the coffee is delish, and the hodgepodge decor actually feels authentic. Maybe your kooky aunt is actually the owner. Maybe all the dishes actually came from Goodwill. This table...hey wait, this is the same chipped-enamel kitchen table we have in our apartment, from my in-laws' parents' house. 

I've been here for morning coffee (scones, mmmmm) and for lunch (soup with bread for $2.75. Seriously.), and will be back again."}
{"text":"Great place if you want some healthy and affordable vegetarian food. I always get the chili when I'm there. Mmm and they make pretty great brownies, too!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! We went there for lunch before a business meeting in the area. Inexpensive, yet serving high quality and tasty food. The croque-chèvre with honey and sundried tomatoes pesto was just perfect. A great bang for the buck.

The decor, eclectic and vintage, fits perfectly in this hipster neighborhood.

I found the staff to be efficient. They were not perhaps the friendliest and warmest bunch of people I've met, but they weren't rude either.

Only one negative: they do not accept any cards, so plan in advance. Otherwise you're forced to use (and pay fees) by using the ATM on the premises. I understand why a small place wouldn't want to accept credit cards as their processing fees are fairly high. But no Interac? They should offer it, even if they post a minimum of 10$ per transaction or something.

I will definitely return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful veg place in the trendy \"Mile End\" neighbourhood of Montreal. The veggie burger is among the best I've had (see my pics) and is a combination of some sort of soy crumble, beans and vegetables with this amazing sauce and a salad to accompany it. 

The atmosphere is busy and noisy but you can tell the clientele is made up of regulars that come back often! 

They have live music in the back room."}
{"text":"Decent mocha. Hipster heaven. Loud and angry music. Brought me back to my youth.
The food looked pretty good, and the drinks were cheap. Want to go back for the \"remedy\" which has ginger and whiskey."}
{"text":"No fuss vegan cafe, awesome quaint live venue in the back, free wifi, lots of character, you can drink here if you eat."}
{"text":"Ambiance d'etudiant, décoration hippie, plusieurs tables, la porte derriere le comptoir donne acces à une autre section avec plus de tables. La limonade maison est apprecié :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, not sure why it remains so popular. Food is ok, but nothing great and their coffee is awful. Their beer is decent and sort of makes up for the rest. Sometimes they do have good concerts."}
