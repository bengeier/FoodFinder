{"text":"Excellent place for crepes. Had a chicken, spinach, pepper lunch crepe and my friend had a chocolate/banana dessert crepe and both were excellent. The coffee was not hot enough so I'd skip the java but stick with the crepes. Wide variety of both salty and dessert crepes and they come in white or mixed flour. Worth visiting."}
{"text":"Ordered a nutella and strawberry crepe on a regular crepe. So delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by the extra fruit on my plate. They make them so much better there than in the states. It is the perfect place to go eat breakfast before or after you hike Mont Royal and has a nice atmosphere with beautiful tables. It is right off the Mont Royal Metro stop across the street towards the left off the orange line. Would definitely come here again when in Montreal.

4 instead of 5 stars because the waitress was slow on the water department and making sure we had water."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst crepe place!!!
Service first off sucks - the waitresses could care less about you. The crepes are oily and horribly done. If you want a crepe don't come here !!!!"}
