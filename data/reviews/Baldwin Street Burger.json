{"text":"We drive from Ajax to Baldwin for some of the best food in Durham. My personal favourite is the Poutine. We order it with the Double Smoked Bacon. It comes layerd perfectly with curds and the most awesome gravy. Its not just resting on top. The place is always busy. The staff are friendly and great. The price is afforfable. Totally awesome place to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. Well worth the money and the wait...busy place! Southern bbq is my fav. Curried ketchup is a must for the fries. Support local businesses, they are worthy."}
{"text":"This is my go to burger place. You will spend about $3 more than at A&W. But the food is so much better here than any chain could ever hope for. The freshest ingredients, the most creative and delicious specials, and a simple but fantastic menue come together with the cozy atmosphere to create something magical. It is worth your time to drive out there and have one of the best burgers of your life. My favourite is usually the Caesar but the special of the week is also a great choice, you can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"This one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.   It is worth the trip from Toronto.   Every burger is great and the poutine.... For get about it."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! The pads are great and also the sides, the onion rings are very crunchy and their fries are seasoned to the perfect point."}
{"text":"If your looking for fast friendly service Baldwin burgers is the place to go with the best poutine in Durham a must try."}
{"text":"These might be the best burgers I have ever ate. We were on a long drive and randomly found this place.

If you like a good burg, go!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Whitby/Durham. The staff is so friendly and down to earth, it's always busy when you go in but the service is quick. I've eaten in the restaurant multiple times and ordered for takeout and have never been disappointed. The mac & cheese is life changing and I always go with the bourbon BBQ burger."}
{"text":"great burgers - really are. prices are a little high but worth the extra few bucks in my option. However, the place is small, really small. So getting a table can be a challenge. Also people standing in line to order are very close to your table which has a negative impact on your experience."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, fries, onion rings, fried pickles and shakes.  Loved the fresh taste of the burgers and fixings. Amazing staff that took our orders and served us so quickly and efficiently. We had 24 people from our hockey team and families. We were in and out within an hour! Everyone can't stop talking about how great it was! Thanks to Ashley and his team at Baldwin Street Burgers!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and wasnt a fan. Service was good but burgers were so dry. No flavor at all. Poutine was great...but for a burger joint, you need to have a well prepared burger. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Food was super delicious. French onion burger and fried pickles were fantastic.
Decor is casual but comfortable. 
Haven't tried anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Where to start... I've been for dinner here 4 times in 4 days, depending on the week.  The burgers (especially on a turkey patty) are always amazing.  I've had every single one on there, and a ton of the specials.

Speaking of the specials - they are always awesome.  If you ever get the chance to have the Shepard's Pie Poutine, you need to get it.

If you're not in the mood for fries, get the salad - both are good, and the dressing are very nice, especially the citrus chive.

One caveat to this whole thing - good food means long lines.  If you're eating around 6pm, be prepared to wait ~20 minutes for your food.  Call ahead if you can!"}
{"text":"A great burger at a big price. That's the only reason the fifth star was not awarded. If you've got some dough to spare you won't find a better burger on Baldwin St. Everything I've tried has been good to great."}
{"text":"I'm the first to get chain restaurant fatigue especially in an area like Whitby, so a place like Baldwin Street burger has become my go-to takeout choice for more occasions than I'd like to admit. This business hits home runs on all fronts - delicious ingredients, flavour combinations and well made foods in a cosy, modern, rustic restaurant environment you'd expect to find in takeouts in Toronto. All burgers and sides are well made and full of flavour that you can't find anywhere else. I usually have the vegetarian portobello burger and its the best I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"Not as good as the previous reviews.  The burger was dry and tasted like cardboard.  Would not visit again."}
{"text":"My brother and his family highly recommended this place to me. Several times. I'm not from the area but was passing through recently and decided to check this place out myself. I'm very glad I did. The burgers were delicious. The price is quite reasonable as well. The Decour could stand a little bit of improvement, but then again that's just me. I thought it would be nice as a diner... highly recommend it. Good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and hand cut fries.  Love their burger  topping  combos and old fashioned  floats! 
The place is tiny though.  But that is the only  drawback.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"The Baldwin Street Burger is my go-to whenever I visit Whitby. The burgers choices are quite diverse, having a little something for everybody. Although the prices are a bit high, the portions are considerably larger than your typical chain restaurant. 

For a small rustic-chic restaurant, it is clear it attracts quite a few locals. The restaurant offers crayons at every table for you to drawn on the brown towel napkins, and the artwork of the younger guests are displayed on the walls around the establishment. It's nice to see a restaurant that proudly represents the image of their community; quite a rare gem in this day and age where restaurants tend to be carbon copies of one another.

Overall if you are looking for a solid burger joint on ab empty stomach, you won't go wrong with Baldwib Street Burger."}
{"text":"As promised...

I wrote an \"average\" review for this fresh made burger joint a year ago...
Here we are a year later and two - three visits under my belt since the initial visit and I have to admit, this place has improved immensly!!
All my visits have been delicously rewarded with great fresh, hot and perfectly prepared bugers!
I have had the \"French Onion\", \"The Philly\" and \"Steak Burger\" all with specific ingredients that make the structured burger a real treat!!! I am a huge fan of the French Onion.. sauted onion and garlic aioli are just a few ingredients that make this mouth watering burger a hit!!!


Would I reccommend this place? 
For sure !

Remember to all Yelpers-
Try to give a place a second chance, sometimes it only takes a second visit to change your mind. (we all have bad days)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise hidden in downtown Brooklin! I walked right by it when I was looking for it. Look for the cow sign! 

Grab a table if you see one as soon as you get in, because if it's busy, you won't get one! The menu is insane and I want to try everything on it. My mom and stepdad had been here once before and we dying to come back. Today we tried Southern BBQ burger with fries and onion rings.   

The fries were amazing. I definitely want to try a poutine. The onion rings were huge and crunchy. Mmmmmm. The burgers were delicious. So flavourful and juicy. You could really taste the smoky flavour in the bacon. Coleslaw on the burger was great; I never thought of putting coleslaw on it, but I'd do it again. Tangy with a pleasant crunch. The bourbon birch beer bbq sauce didn't over power. 

Need a good burger? Fast food won't cut it! Head to Baldwin Street Burger and it will keep you coming back. I definitely want to!  

Support local business!"}
{"text":"We have been visiting baldwin for a while.  It was always a place that had the freshly ground good quality meat for their burgers.  Unfortunately, perhaps they are struggling, or making a change to explore different recipes for their beef mixture.  

As others have stated in the past few months (on yelp) the burgers have gotten gristly, i have had to ask for a replacement a couple of times as the burger was inedible.  

Their fries have also lost the garnish and sometimes are old and lacking freshness.  The ceaser burger has lost the parmesan cheese slice or parmesan completely and instead replaced with a dusting of parmesan or something that resembles parmesan.  

Finally the cuts have taken a beating on the burger and now burgers have reduced gristle and moved onto mixture with beef filler (organs and misc parts - i can clearly taste beef heart).  As a result burgers are dryer (cant medium rare organs) and chewy.  

I hope the owners hear the customers and bring back the quality, and if not permit-able financially, perhaps increase the cost or reduce size of burger and offer the current sized patty for a premium.  

I also wish there was a good alternative for non meat eaters as the chicken burger is practically terrible with zero seasoning. 

Overall we will look for a different place as the quality has considerably declined.  

Rule #1 in the industry is to be consistent."}
{"text":"Went a while okay, it was okay but nothing special and service was a bit rude. Got the Mac n cheese because I gotta eat halal, it was salty and oily. I like the decor and atmosphere but the cashier was on his phone and did not give a shit if we got served."}
{"text":"Excellent French Onion burgers & fried pickles! Everything on the menu looks delicious, but I fancied some mushroom flavour and chose the French Onion based on other reviews. Yelp prevails once again! The meat was so fresh and had a nice texture - not too blended but kind of a chunky grind, so it felt more 'real', and not laden with fillers (you'll know what I mean).

The caramelized onions along with the mushrooms impart a juicy seasoning to the meat, which itself is tender and flavourful. The bread is notably soft, which is always key in a great burger. 

Fried pickles: not the healthiest choice but man are they good. A perfect crunch.

The vintage decor is cool in a down-to-earth way, with the wooden paneling and solid tables. Very cozy and a nice change from other burger joints with the standard 'git 'er done' style metal furniture. 

It's nice to see original art and signs being preserved, and this place blends nicely with the surrounding historic village shops. (Incidentally, pop next door for some icecream/froyo in summer!)"}
{"text":"The star of the show: the sides! Deep fried pickles, poutine, onion rings and Mac and cheese, all to die for. The onions and pickles are fried to perfection in Panko breading and the fries are perfectly seasoned. The burgers are nothing special, though I appreciate that they use naturally raised local beef.

My boyfriend and I each ordered a burger and made it into a combo. For 2 burgers, 2 sides and 2 cans of pop it came to $30. I would have been ok with this price if the burger was amazing, but it was not.

I opted for the southern BBQ burger. The toppings went well together, though I was disappointed in the bacon. They gave me 1 piece of bacon that was not Smokey or crispy.  The burger patty itself was severely over cooked. If the restaurant boasts great quality beef, there should be no reason to cook the patties until they have no more juices. This was a major disappointment, as I needed to add more ketchup to make it less dry. 

I'd come back here to order a poutine and deep fried pickles, but I would skip the burger."}
{"text":"Top quality burger no matter where you are from. They simply do a masterful job with their burgers.  I cannot take anything away from them.  However their poutine was a little disappointing. If the burgers are a 5/5, then their poutine is a 3.5/5. Nothing special. For poutine go to Petes but bite burgers in whitby."}
{"text":"This place has delicious burgers! I went here on a thursday at around 7 pm and it was pretty much packed. I got the kids burger with fries, which were so tasty! I loved the burger and the fries. I got the classic toppings, but next time I am definitely going to venture out and try one of the other burgers. 

The only downsides were that the place is pretty small and that its a bit on the expensive side for a burger place. I got a kids meal and my boyfriend got a burger, fries and a drink, and it was $20. I would understand it being so expensive if this place was downtown and had to pay sky high rent, but this isn't the case."}
{"text":"My wife & I were looking for somewhere to eat, & she was in the mood for a burger, so we decided to try Baldwin Street Burger.  We were there at 5:45 on a Sunday night, & we were the only ones there when we arrived, although a few other customers came in & grabbed take-out while we were eating.

The place was very cool, & it's pretty unique as far as burger places go.  It's very old-school & rural, with all sorts of rustic signs hanging on the walls.  It has an old, market-type atmosphere inside with the butcher-block tables & everything.

My wife & I both opted for the Southern BBQ Burger, which comes with double-smoked bacon, coleslaw, smoked cheddar & bourbon birch beer BBQ sauce.  The burgers were delicious, & cooked just right.  The toppings were great, & the twice-fried french fries were excellent.  My wife chose to get deep-fried pickles as the side with her combo, & I couldn't help but sneak one when she wasn't looking, & as good as the fries were, I should've chosen the pickles, too.  The breading was super-crispy, & there was no way that the pickles were store-bought, off-the-shelf pickles.  They were bursting with flavour & better than any other deep-fried pickles I've had anywhere else.

We got a  kids burger combo & a BSB Bite combo for the kids.  The BSB Bites are basically homemade popcorn chicken, & the kids loved it.  Next time we'll get both of  them the Bites.

Baldwin Street Burger has a decidedly upscale feel in a casual relaxed atmosphere, but the prices are definitely on the upscale side.  For the two burger combos, & the two kids' meals, it came to just over $40 with taxes.  Definitely not a cheap night out for burgers.  The food was great & the service was excellent, so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk into this quaint shop .. you can cleary see that Baldwin Burger is run by passionate, young owners that put a priority on quality, and locally sourced products. It's clear they care about, and are proud of what they serve.

My family lives within walking distance, and have eaten there at least a dozen times. Paired with some Kawartha Ice Cream just around the corner it makes for a nice quiet evening.

My wife rotates between a number of their burgers (French Onion, Mushroom, and Caesar), but always gets the fried pickles and a water. I swear by their Buffalo Wing burger, and love the fries with a nice cold Boylan's Black Cherry soda.

You can get a cheaper burger in Whitby/Brooklin area, but it certainly won't be as tasty. Won't be grass fed local beef ... and won't have their blue cheese aioli on it (that stuff, made in-house .. is awesome) 

However, note .. they are closed Monday, and Tuesday. When I questioned the owner, he was quick to say they want to keep quality controls on all the food and prep. The owners use those days to prepare for the week and ensure they keep to their very high food standards. 

I would highly recommend Baldwin Burger if you are looking for a great burger, fries/rings/pickles. Either Dine-in, or take out."}
{"text":"Great burger with fresh cut fries and homemade onion rings!  Food presentation was excellent.  Before my burger arrived I saw someone else's getting served and my jaw dropped when I saw how the burger and fries were presented.  Was really hoping my burger was going to be the same, and it was!  Beautifully wrapped burger on a wooden cutting board, bowl of fries and garlic dip.

It's a small place, plenty of tables though. Friendly service, cozy atmosphere.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place (6 -6 seater tables and a 3 seater bar at the front window), decor of a Smokehouse. You can always tell when your sitting in a great restaurant when there is a take-out line-up that goes almost out the door.  
The Burgers were amazing, the only thing that would have made them Stellar is if the burgers were made with fresh out of the oven baked buns. However .. The food is DELISH! The homemade onion rings gigantic. Again if I was to be picky I think the  rings would have been out of this world if they had done thicker sliced onions inside. Ample side portion of fries.  
All in all left with my belly fun and a satisfied smile on my face ... 
Friendly service, fast. Parking on street .. Loved it! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Baldwin is regarded as one of Durhams best burgers .... And they didn't disappoint!!! Had the buffalo wing burger with the onion rings!   Friendly service, cool atmosphere and not bad prices... Don't miss the chance to try this burger!"}
{"text":"When the burger craving hits, I head to Baldwin Burger in Brooklin (say THAT 3x fast).

I almost always get the French Onion burger (8 oz patty with red wine glazed caramelized onions, sautéed field mushrooms, gruyere cheese, roasted garlic aioli). I make it a combo with the twice fried fries and a root beer. 

You can also get the deep fried pickles instead of the fries. Or mac n cheese. Or salad. Or soup of the day. 

BB also has feature sandwiches and they're so diverse. They've had Philly Steak to Bulgogi with homemade kimchee to Shrimp Po-Boys to Salmon burgers to Indian-spiced veggie burgers. The chefs are creative and passionate and it shows in their food. 

The poutine is no joke either. Order the small because, for some reason, BB serves them with American portions (as in holy crap that's a lot of poutine!!!).

I do wish they had dessert there (the previous owners used to have these magnificent butter tarts from a local bakery) but I consoled myself with a milkshake made with Kawartha ice cream. 

What more could one ask for? Cool joint, friendly people, and delicious food. Why haven't you come here yet?"}
{"text":"Mmmm so delicious!! The burgers are so fresh and they have so many types of burgers to choose from. The quality of the meet is excellent and the service is always so great too! They seem to value their staff too! 
I love their presentation on wood boards burned with their logo. 
I know others like their fries but they don't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger in Durham Region,  if not everywhere I've eaten. Their patties are made from locally sourced antibiotic-free beef that's ground fresh daily. All of their ingredients are fresh made from scratch. I've ordered almost all of their flavour combinations and enjoyed them all, but for me the absolute biggest reason to visit is their poutine! The large is a small meal for two.  Order with bacon and experience it perfectly layered with curds, bacon and thouroughly coated in gravy."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Worth the darive. The mushroom is fantastic with the truffle aiole."}
{"text":"May as well bump an old review - Baldwin Street is still doing what they do and doing it very, very well. They've taken to running Groupon promotions from time to time that are great - but be careful to read the fine print, as they're not good until a few weeks after they're sold.

I don't eat many hamburgers, but when I do, they're usually worth the trek to Brooklin."}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down I make the trek for this place. Try the mushroom burger!!and the classic and everything"}
{"text":"For the area this place would be have to be considered as being at the top.
Very good, but just short of excellent burger, fries were decent.
Might be rating it a little on the low side as it was quite the drive to get there and I was anticipating greatness based of other reviews.
If in the area I'd visit again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Brooklin, actually, so when I found myself cruising through the old neighborhood, I figured I should check out one of the new restaurants that've popped up since my departure.

One of my favorite dishes of all time is French Onion Soup, so when I saw something called The French Onion (\"red wine glazed caramelized onions, sautéed field mushrooms, gruyere cheese, roasted garlic aioli\") on the menu I knew I had to order it.

It's a decent burger. The patty is relatively juicy and fairly substantial, while the toppings actually did remind me of a French Onion Soup. My one major complaint would be the heavy hand with which the chef applied the aforementioned roasted garlic aioli, as the condiment was a little overwhelming in certain bites and did tend to drown out the other flavors in the burger.

The fries were solid, too, and seemed like they'd be perfect in a poutine."}
{"text":"The best burger joint in Durham hands down. My favourite is the steak dinner burger, the fries are amazing and try out the garlic dill aioli dipping sauce! I compare every burger I eat to Baldwin Burger and so far no burger has surpassed Baldwins! Staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten plenty of burgers in my time. I like to think of myself as a bit of a burger connoisseur. Why I mention this is because this restaurant has by far the best burger I've eaten to-date. Given that i've eaten a lot of burgers, that speaks volumes to the awesomeness of this little restaurant. I highly recommend the Buffalo Wing burger."}
{"text":"These folks should not change a thing. A nice family run atmosphere. Seating is limited but we were able to get a table. You order and they bring the food to you. Don't expect a fast in and out but you don't want that here. Everything is fresh in house and incredible. My wife ordered the Caesar Burger and i ordered the Southern Burger. Both delicious if i had to say one was better it was the Southern. Caesar could have used the crunch of croutons! We also had fries that were delicious. For sure will come back!!"}
{"text":"The boys and I went in for lunch for the first time and we were happy we did. Although it is expensive the food is quite good and it's very filling. Creative special burgers are great to try as a treat from the normal. I got a nacho burger and the guac it was topped with was so fresh and tasty. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! First time I tried it, I thought it must be too good to be true, maybe a fluke that it tasted so awesome. But every time since, which is over the last two years, it's been amazing! Fried pickles are my thing, and I've tried almost every type of gourmet burger which were all super satisfying. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was SSSOOOOO bummed..... Closed the day after Thanksgiving..... I got huge reviews and recommendations by some local friends..... got all hyped up reviewed menu online - had all four burgers for lunch picked out and all we needed to do is order.... got to the store with a Big Closed sign..... darn....

Back home and never got to try this burger joint - the kudos from my friends burger aficionado lifestyle speaks volumes so I knew I had to go for myself....not this trip

PS looked cheap too"}
{"text":"A miss...

It was our first try, primarily based on reviews we saw here on Yelp. Should've paid more attention to the negative ones. It was very disappointing. The burgers were small and absolutely lacking in flavour. I had the French Onion and Chris has the regular. Onion rings were over done and very little for what you paid. Fries were good. $30 dollars later - felt kind of ripped off and still hungry. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Drove here from Ajax to taste what was supposed to be \"the best burger in Durham\"
I had \"The Mushroom\". Unfortunately my burger was very dry due to being overcooked. I think a bun can make or break a burger but this bun was a little on the stale side. Very disappointing.
The fries on the other hand were excellent! I'd come back for the fries if I lived a little closer.
My wife had the \"Nacho Grande\" burger."}
{"text":"I am usually not a Poutine Lover until but Baldwin Street Burger might have converted me.

Even their most basic poutine ($5) was so good. Loaded with cheese curds, I mean loaded... and the gravy was hot enough to melt the cheese to make it all stringy. The gravy itself was not over salty.. just perfect. 

And for the Burger, oh yes we did order a burger. 

The Southern BBQ ($8) - Double smoked bacon, coleslaw, smoked cheddar, bourbon-birch beer bbq sauce

Cooked when order using local naturally raise beef. 

I like how all signature burgers are for $8 and for $3.25 extra I can upgrade to a combo and for extra $2 even to a poutine.

Burger was good, love how the toppings worked well together, but can I have more poutine!

Definitely worth visiting if you are in the area, it is on the way to Cottage Country. A great pit shop! 

Can I have more poutine, please?!"}
{"text":"The food at Baldwin Street Burger is probably the best in town. The burgers are well portioned, well cooked, and delicious. The onion rings and specialty fries are to die for. The atmosphere is great and the staff, while not the most friendly in the world, are great at what they do and keep the business running smoothly. 

Frankly, I feel little need to get into the specifics of the food quality. Suffice to say, it is good! Try it yourself! I'm a particular fan of the Southwest burger and it has come to be my favorite and regular order. 

I only have two complaints: Firstly the business is pricey. While it is very good food, I don't always feel that it warrants the price. This business is not for people who are tight in the wallet department. Secondly, the business hours are pure chaos! Sometimes I have a hankering for a good Baldwin Street Burger only to find that they are closed without much explanation. They also have irregular business hours compared to other places in the area so be sure to check online or call before going out there. You might find that you just wasted a car trip! 

Nonetheless, I love this place and I highly recommend it. The burgers are just plain old good, and you can't argue with that."}
{"text":"BSB is an absolute gem! Quality, fresh never frozen ingredients. An outstanding menu with great flavour profiles (the panko crusted ONION RINGS are die for!).
Run...don't walk to this amazing burger house. Once you've experienced this menu, you'll forget all about the burger chains out there!"}
{"text":"My favourite gourmet burger spot in Durham!

Burgers are fantastic. Everything is fresh, high quality, and exploding with flavour. You won't find another burger like this in Durham Region. Eaten my way through the menu and I've never been disappointed. I can't even pick a favourite, but if it is your first time I will say try the French Onion or the Southern BBQ. Their burgers are high quality, and they have innovative burger choices which is awesome. Their fries are also to die for, and everybody I know loves their onion rings and deep fried pickles!

The environment is great, the people are always friendly and helpful, and they have really great weekly specials. A burger combo will set you back about $12-15 but the quality is really worth it in my opinion.

I recommend everybody check this place out at least once."}
{"text":"On the outskirts of Markham just a bit east, well quite a bit it's all the way to Whitby, just turn left to head north on Tauton to Baldwin Street and in a smallish shop with even smallish signs, I have encountered my second favorite burger.  Much better and cheaper in terms of taste compared to Paradise Farms which was my old favorite.

My old co-worker kept on posting pictures of this on Facebook and since I happen to be in the area, I decided to call him up after about 3 years of no communication to ask him just one question: where is this burger place.  I have no friends... I just know people who have not outlived their usefulness ^_^

One of my posse that night decided to get the \"Steak Dinner\" burger to share.  The \"Steak Dinner\" burger now has the honor of being my second favorite burger.  The meat was tender and chunky.  It was like biting into smaller chunks of beef stew in every bite.  Every bite makes me want to just gulp the whole thing and take another one.  *will power* *breath* *will power* okay I didn't splurge myself then. ^_^  After all, it's only my second favorite burger.

My co-worker's recommendation is \"French Onion\" burger with deep fried pickles and that is nearly indescribable how much joy and sorrow I felt biting and tasting that piece of burger perfection.  The \"French Onion\" burger wins my title as the best burger I have ever tasted (sorry Paradise, your Kobe beef burger just dropped to 3rd place for me).  The thing was really tasty and fragrant, you don't even need to be a beef connoisseur to be able to tell that this surpasses any other burger on the planet. *will power* *breath* *will power*

Thankfully we also got the deep fried pickles.  It was okay, not as exciting as the above, but it goes well together with the burgers to give it a little bit of home town cafeteria feel.

Will I go there again? Most definitely.  However, I doubt I would order those two burgers again for myself for a while.  Why? So I can taste the rest of their menu, there's still many more to choose from."}
