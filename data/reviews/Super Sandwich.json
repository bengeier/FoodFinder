{"text":"This place is a little hidden inside Le Cartier building but worth visiting for any one wanting a quick feed for cheap.
It's a convenience store so you have all the basic convenience store goods as well but everyone lines up for the sandwiches. 
The egg salad as the previous reviewer said is great and the chicken salad is awesome and a whole lot better than most of the crap Subway sell. The bread is fresh and tasty and you'll get it slightly warm when ready.
Ever since finding out about this place I've gone every few days and my taste buds and wallet thank me for it."}
{"text":"Solid food for a great prices!! I sometimes stock up on their sandwiches and go home to hole up and study!"}
{"text":"Keys to success for any Mcgill student/alum.

Great prices, value and fast service. The salami is a classic of mine -- top notch."}
{"text":"This rating is based on convenience, price, and quality.  A McGill management student might say an awesome cost-benefit given a university student's low budget.  It's also just an awesome sandwich; very big, toasted French bun, and just delicious.  NO McGill, Concordia, or nearby professional should go without having tried a super sandwich.  

Prices range from $2.25 to at most $5.000.  The clear favorite is the egg sandwich($2.75).  Can add a soda and bag of chips for $1.75 extra."}
{"text":"I used to go here on a semi daily basis my second year at McGill and loved their sandwiches. Going there so often made me want to try other things and I sorta forgot about its existence...until halfway through every fall term when the new grad students would tell me about this \"new place\" they'd discovered called super sandwich. On Monday I went there again as I didn't bring enough food to school and many memories came to mind...

Super sandwich, despite its cryptic location, seems to find its way. Their subs are fantastic and really cheap, which makes them ideal for student budgets. If you're in a rush, the longest part of getting lunch will be the \"trek,\" as the sandwich will be ready within 30 seconds of placing your order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot go-to when I forget to pack my lunch (which is admittedly quite often!). Who can ask for more? A huge variety of sandwich fillings and all for under $5 (with taxes, chips and soda) plus or minus a dollar.

It sounds silly, but it's cheaper to buy your lunch here than to bring something from home! The French bread is warm and tasty, the fillings freshly cut or made. I love their egg salad sandwich and with a chips and a pop, it comes to $4.75! 

You will always see a line-up, especially when the students come back for school. I hope they stay in business forever!"}
{"text":"Yea this place is pretty much Mcgill sandwich haven. So cheap and so fast. Decent sandwich. During finals I'll buy multiple sandwiches and just eat these all day. This is kinda sad."}
{"text":"Even at ~3.50$, I'm hesitating on revisiting. I got one smoked chicken and one pastrami sub.

In the subs, they add lettuce, 1.5 slices of tomato, couple slices of processed meat, and mustard or mayonnaise. 

The smoked chicken was literally slices of processed chicken like the ones you order at the supermarket for cheap sandwiches and nothing like the gud ole smoked chicken I'm used to get at a BBQ. 

The pastrami must have been some of the worst corned beef I've had in my life. Can't describe what went wrong, but it lacked a lot in flavour.

Thank Lord for the mustard, for I got to enjoy mustard on white bread.

Giving it 3/5 based on convenience (close to a school library, quick service, and cheap subs)."}
{"text":"I wish I would've found out about this place earlier in my college career! Located less than a 2 minute walk from campus, Super Sandwich is the perfect cheap meal for any student with sandwiches ranging from around $3-$4.75. They have turkey (my usual), Black Forest ham, crab salad (that one isn't too great imo), chicken salad (was delicious when I used to eat chicken), salami, pastrami, egg salad, pickled vegetables, smoked chicken, smoked ham, and a few more types of sandwiches. Each sandwich comes with mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese depending on the sandwich. What makes this place so great is that the sandwiches are made in less than 30 seconds, and you're literally in and out in the blink of an eye. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Super Sandwich may or may not be an ongoing hostage situation.... either that or a sandwich based cult? Normal employees are not this fast and consistent.

Super Sandwich is fast, consistent, and consistently #$%@ing fast. 

18 seconds passed between when I exchanged payment for my sandwich, and when I received it. With a line stretching to the back of the store you can expect to be out of there in 5 minutes. 

A roast beef sandwich and a soda will run you $5.25, fill your stomach, and be easy on your wallet."}
