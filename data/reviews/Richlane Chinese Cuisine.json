{"text":"I came here last Tuesday with an open mind. Since I  saw the mixed review here and on CH.   But we wanted to try.     We ordered   the beef and broccoli Curry chicken bowl Fish hotpot       Price 2/5 Service  4/5 Atmosphere  4.5/5 Food    2/5         Would I return . Probably not  with a small group of 2 or 3.  But good value for the higher end set menu. And they offer a cash discount foe the set menu.  There is a cantonese place Inthe small mall that would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"the choices is very limited however the quality of the food is much higher than a lot of the places I've been to. the price is pod when going between 2 to 4 and in the morning otherwise the prices are too high. the cooks defn know innovation and is definitely worth a try. has wifi also"}
{"text":"Very quiet and nice place to hang out for dim sum with your family or friends on weekdays with their $2.9 special before 11:00am. Food is A OK nothing really stand out as their signature dish. This would be my second choice beside Dragon Boat Fusion with less crowd and easier to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"We have came here a few times. Food is okay however the reception lady is terrible. We went last week and asked for a table. There were tons of tables around and she would say that there were no tables and we must share table with someone or we'll WAIT FOR A LONG TIME. It is clearly that she is lying and she just turned her back on us. Chinese dim sum at this class that requires sharing tables are uncommon. Terrible terrible service. She probably doesn't want our business. We just walked out and we definitely will not come back again for dim sum or dinner."}
{"text":"I went for Dim Sum on the weekend with my family. The food was pretty good but it is quite expensive. The selection was not too great, they have all the regular stuff but nothing out of the ordinary.   One thing that really struck me is the Dim Sum order menu. You write your order on this menu that is very nice. The quality of the paper is as good the their dinner menu. I feel that its such a waste since you write your order once and it gets thrown out or recycle."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants because my partner is Chinese. I have found that some Chinese restaurants don't know how to handle non Chinese customers, and some of them won't even speak English. I have to say that this is the first time that I have such an excellent experience at a Chinese restaurant.  Service was friendly, attentive and educated.  Food was AAA+ and the place itself is fantastic with tall ceilings and lots of space between the tables."}
{"text":"Great ambience and food.  No issues imho would def. go back :) The set menus for dinner was great!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to have dinner at this restaurant...   Food is decent but the service is not good at all...   Feel like being treated as trash... To start with, we have 11 people for dinner and they miscounted us and gave us 10 soups and we ask for one more and the server said that's it from the container and no more...  During the rest of the meal,  those servers showed not good attitude... At the end,  when we paid for the dinner,  the server just stand next to us and wait for us to count cash...   End up we just paid very little tips... The server yelled back and ask us how much we paid...   What kind of service, how much is the tips...   And no next time...."}
{"text":"Not great and expensive.   Tripe was too tough to eat and cut into huge pieces.   The sago baked pudding was burned in flavour and the rice rolls mushy.  When I pointed it out to the wait staff they did nothing.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"One of the better quality Chinese restaurants that I enjoy. It us a little pricier but worth it as  the service is excellent.   The dishes are a little different and not just your typical chinese dishes.  I would recommend coming here if you want quality food and a bit of different variety."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner once with my family.  The food was definitely enjoyable.  That said, I find it to be a bit pricey for what it is.  We were a party of 8.  We ordered their dinner for 6, along with 2 other a la carte dishes.  It came up to over $400 with tax and tip.    Just a few days prior, I had dinner at another restaurant.  We had ordered a similar meal, minus the shark fin soup.  The price was more than half of what it cost at Richlane.    That said, Richlane was much better decorated and spacious."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum lunch with family. Both the food and service were mediocre. We were given a table in the lower level. As is typical with most Chinese restaurants, the place was loud and crowded, with people playing mahjong in a room next door.  We ordered a variety of dim sum and the standouts were the har gow (big chunks of shrimp), siu mai (there are 5 in an order instead of the usual 4!), and baked barbecue pork buns (loved the crispy top).  For dessert, the egg tarts were quite good, but there were only 2 per order. We also tried the ?? (deep-fried bows of dough glazed with honey), which was disappointingly lackluster. The dough was too thick and wasn't tasty at all. We only ate a few bites of it and left the rest."}
{"text":"Your typical dim sum go-to spot for when you have a craving for siu mai and har gow. By no means are the dim sum here exceptional, but the seating is quite ample and you don't typically need to wait a long duration of time to be seated.   In terms of choice, the menu is quite varied and there is a little bit of something for everyone. Some niche favorites aren't available however, such as the curry cuttlefish or tofu pudding which definitely hurts the experience for some who favors these dishes.   Service of the staff are quite swift and responsive when you need them, which is always quite nice. The accessibility of restrooms is sometimes rather inconvenient as you have to make a trek to them, located at the other end of the building.   Overall, service is on-point, parking generally isn't a problem, food is decent but not a comprehensive experience for fans of dim sum."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Having been here several times with a regular and then coming here without them, I was literally treated like trash by the employees. Mainland attitude - never again."}
{"text":"Old school Cantonese cuisine in Richmond Hill at its finest.  I came here for my lunar calendar birthday, which is actually a thing, so of course Cantonese cuisine was called for.  They have a $46 (tax in) set menu which is a welcome alternative to Winterlicious.  A starter of birds nest soup had large chunks of nourishing birds nest.  This was followed by an appetizer of stewed goose feet with Chinese mushrooms and veggies.  If you like the dim sum chicken feet you should be ok with this one.  For the main, you can select from a wide varieties of entrees, and we had the shrimp with scrambled egg whites and milk, Taiwanese three cup chicken, and Satay beef with Guilan.  Dessert was a whole papaya with egg filling, steamed until the egg is cooked.  Sometimes it's good to go back to the old school."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner on September 16, 2017 and I am reviewing for both the Peking duck and the customer service.  The peking duck deserves a 4/5 or even higher. You do get what you pay for. The roasted duck had a nice amount of fat and the meat was tender and moist. The skin was exceptional, nicely crisp and not burnt. We had the flat pancake which was also very moist and soft. They gave us  spring onions and hoisin sauce which complement the dish well. The meat portion, they made a savoury pastry consisting of the duck meat and diced carrots and celery. Overall rather good.  In terms of the customer service portion, I have to give it a 2/5. Granted we were sitting on the second floor. We had to wait about five minutes to even order food, even though we flagged the staff several times. Did they forget about us? Not sure. Then, as we wanted to order bowls of rice, it came about 10 minutes later but that's because we once again had to flag them down asking for the rice. The dishes were all cold because the rice never came. We were not impressed with the service as we seemed to be ignored.   Overall, the food is great. We had other dishes as well such as a tofu casserole dish and sweet and sour pork. But the customer service really through the ratings way down. Get your A-game on and improve the service please."}
{"text":"The place is tucked away in a small plaza, I would not have known about it if I wasn't in the area for something else.  It has two floors and is decorated nicely, well lit and clean like one would expect from a higher end Chinese restaurant.   We got here at 1040am on a weekday to enjoy the early bird Dim Sum special.  Just make sure you submit your order before 11am to get dishes on the cheap.  Otherwise, the regular prices are expensive for dim sum dishes:  S-$2.80  M-$3.80  L-$4.80  XL-$6.80  SP-$8.80  The quality of the dishes were hit and miss depending on what you ordered.  The bbq pork buns come 3, but are rather small.  The Hai Gow on the other hand, unexpectedly came with 5 pieces.  Overall, it's a pretty restaurant that is worth trying if you can get here before 11am."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is decent.  Their service is so-so.  They have an early bird special before 11am where all s/m/l dishes are $3 (cash only) and an afternoon tea special after 2:30pm. This includes weekends too.  The quality of the dim sum is ... ok.  I find that their tea needs more flavour and the dim sum dishes also need more flavour.    We arrived sunday at 10am and since their top floor was full, was sent to the basement rooms.  The ladies serving us were really loud and it seemed like they were shouting at each other across the different rooms having an open conversation for everyone to hear.    I prefer coming here for dim sum over dinner because I find their dinner menu extremely over priced...."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some unique dim sum items like durian puff which is $5 flat for 3 pieces and totally worth the try. The decor of the place is clean and the high ceilings really open up the place. The food is decent. The portions are smaller but the quality of some dim sum items is above average. I would give this place 3.5 stars. The service is a hit and miss. This time around we got a lady named Judy. She was quite rude with her replies.  She also had a constant scowl when she served our food. Made us feel like she was serving prisoners/livestock or something. I think if the management trained their staff a little more on customer service they would be do a lot better in attracting more business."}
{"text":"I only go here for dimsum especially after 2pm on weekdays since most items are $2.80. Almost everything is good and the most order item would  be crispy bbq pork buns very yummy. You will see every table with this bun. Always jam pack at lunch time so make sure to call ahead and reserve a table or just go after 2pm because it's cheaper and most likely you'll get a table faster."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum today. Just missed early bird and too early for the late afternoon prices where dim sum dishes that are S/M/L are all $3. On weekends, this means before 11am or after 2:30pm if you don't want to pay full prices.  Service was decent. This is an above average priced dim sum restaurant. Not as expensive as Crown Prince or Premiere Ballroom but also pricier than Landmark etc.  Recommendations: har gow/shrimp dumplings, cha siu bao/bbq pork buns, steamed sponge cake hk style, green onion pancake beijing style, and milk custard tarts.  Their milk custard tarts are odd in that they come in 2s. So it's $4 for two small tarts instead of the usual 3 or 4 that other dim sum restaurants serve. It's not like they are much bigger although delish. When you can buy full sized ones at Chinese bakeries for less than a dollar each, here it ends up being $2.5 each after tax and tip. Also their squid in dried shrimp sauce portion was really small. Overall portions here are on the smaller side although deliciously fresh.  Will be back to try the durian fried dessert as I continue searching for one similar to the one I had in Vancouver..."}
{"text":"Went here with my family before it opened. There was a crazy long line up during the long weekend to take advantage of the early dim sum specials for $3.  You need to place your order before 11 am on weekends.  Service was not great. Some dishes from our first order came after the ones from our second order. That does not make sense. There is lots of parking and the layout of the restaurant is very narrow with 3 floors. Food wise was average overall but great given the price.  I would not come during the regular price hours. Some dishes are not available until after 11 am."}
{"text":"Dim sum is quite good and great value during afternoon tea at 2-4.  Food quality is quite good and the eating environment is quite nice.  Lots of selection and food is nicely presented.  A little slow in removing my finished dim sum dishes....maybe we ordered too much and ate too quick :).  But overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Okay place for some dim sum. There wasn't anything that was outstanding. I ordered the typical like rice rolls, mango pudding, har gao, so on and so forth. Most were meh. Doesn't really taste fresh and good.. lol. Oh, and for some reason they gave me the mango pudding first like... sweet stuff are usually supposed to come later on in the meal or at the end but it's like they were like nope HERE YA GO GIRL EAT THIS MANGO PUDDING FIRST. ...   Oh, gotta mention this, their service is pretty cruddy. Staff are not attentive and some came off pretty rude like okay mate YOU WANNA FOGHT ME HON ?!? COME HITHER -_-   A cool thing about this place is that they have a level downstairs or something like that for playing mahjong? Not that I know or care for mahjong, but I think it's a cool way to allow for some people to eat and play to their heart's content. ;D  But generally, that aspect isn't really good enough to spend money here. Wouldn't really recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The service is much better than any other dim sum restaurant I've been too. And the food is really fresh and tastes like it was prepared to order. The only exception is the siu mai that does feel like it has a bought in feel because it's lacklustre compared to everything else."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the years.  So far, I had good food here 70% of the time.  The 30% was usually either too sweet or too bland.    They have lots of vegetarian dim sum choices.  It is certainly a bonus if you are a vegetarian or when you do not crave for meat.  The service?  I believe it can be done better."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars not because of the glamour or frills but because it's back to basics Hong Kong dim sum.  We came as a family of 5 and was able to order the usual \"har gow\" (shrimp dumpling) and \"siu mai\" (pork dim sum). We were also able to find some long lost desserts that our family use to have years ago.  The staff was mostly nice and friendly but keep in mind...it's a Chinese restaurant. This place is massive with basement rooms for private bookings and an upstairs that compliments the ground floor tables. The best part is this is one of the only dim sum restaurants that still do \"afternoon tea\" where all dishes (s, m, l) all cost $3 after 2:00pm. Our new go-to family dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Surprised to see all the mediocre reviews. We had dinner here and thought it was delicious. Had a egg white with crab meat dish, soup of the day, veggie with dried fish, and Taiwanese chicken. The first three were the best. The Taiwanese chicken was ok. Prob one was the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in town!"}
{"text":"Had dim sum here with an old co-worker. Food was just ok. Not the greatest. Good to try once and not come back. The price here is quite pricey and small portions. I have way better dim sum at other places."}
{"text":"Review on the dim sum and dinner:  Ever since Regal 16 (the dim sum restaurant replaced with Congee Wong) closed, my family has been looking for another dim sum place. We found this place and thought we'd try it out. However, we thought there was not a lot of choice but that was when it first opened. My family will probably try the dimsum place again once my grandma comes back but right now we are a regular at another dimsum place.   The dinner service here is never a let down. Every time we've gone my family has always been pretty happy with the food and service.  The soup comes in a teapot so it keeps the soup hot and tasty. The soy sauce chicken is delicious. There's something about the added herbs in the sauce that makes it good. There are some orders in the menu (ie. Soy sauce chicken) you need to preorder ahead of time due to popularity.  Last but not least, we finally had the egg white papaya dessert that has been advertised on the table consistently. There were times we've gone but they always ran out. The dessert comes in a papaya literally and they scrape out all the papaya and put the double-boiled fresh milk mix in. I don't know what they do with the papaya though. The dessert is super hot. Even when we were done eating it, it was still hot. It's only $2.80 on the weekends and $8.80 on the weekdays though. Try to get it on the weekend or public holiday. They do advertise the dessert as best for skin care beauty. I can't say it's the best for skin care beauty as my skin has not been the best lately lol."}
{"text":"I see no compelling reason to ever come here again. Prices are high, portions are extremely small, food taste is average, but the restaurant decor is nice and comfortable.  Extremely disappointed with the steamed shrimp roll. Equivalent portion to 2 pieces at other restaurants, plus the shrimp was not deveined. We tried to pick it out and washed the shrimp with tea - what a huge dirty mess. I can't believe a restaurant tried to serve that to customers. And for $4.80!    Never again. I'd be surprised if they were still around 6 months from now.  Richmond hill has many restaurant that taste better and offer better value. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Have been here for both lunch and dinner.  The dim sums here aren't that good.  Siu mai was tiny, but came in 5 pieces.  They were a bit dry tho.  The wrappers of the steamed pork and shrimp dumplings were too thick.  Steamed sponge cake wasn't moist.  Best dim sum today was the deep fried shrimp dumplings.  It had lot of shrimps and it was crispy.  Dim sum here is average, but dinner is good.  Service is excellent and nice decor. ** Morning tea (10 - 11:00) and afternoon tea (2 - 4:00) - S. M and L dim sum @$2.80)**"}
{"text":"The dishes were very tastey. The shark fin soup was good, so was the bbq ribs and oyster mushroom with veggies. The dessert double boiled papaya with milk/eggwhite is a must have here, best one i've tried here in toronto area. The sesame pastry and mango pudding is good too. I rarely compliment in desserts ar chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Richlane Chinese Cuisine is the re-birth of Regal 16. I have to say, this place is very affordable and the food is consistently good. We have gone there for dinner (during the weekday and weekends) and for dimsum during brunch hour over the weekend and it is consistently very busy (all three floors!). I would highly recommend anyone that wants to try good quality and tasting food to try a shot at Richlane. The service at this place could be improved for sure."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant really suites this place. Prices are sky high. This is based on dinner.   Oyster served in a hotpot bowl $28.80 - the oysters themselves tasted okay but were very small considering the price.  Sliced beef with veggies $16.80 Fried egg with shrimp $14.80 Tofu and beef $14.80 sweet and sour pork $16.80 All of the above tasted okay but really nothing stood out as an amazing dish. The quality definitely does not justify the high prices so that is why I have to give this a 2 star rating. Otherwise the food is average at best and deserves a 3 star.  Meal comes with dessert. Mango pudding, green tea pastry puff and sweet red bean soup."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only.  I've been here twice and both times, although the atmosphere is fairly modern and clean, I found that the food quality and quantity weren't worth the price, particularly during peak hours. They have specials before 11am and after 2:30pm, but I don't think I'd go again outside of those times.  The shrimp rice rolls (cheung fun) were smaller than typical restaurants.  This place isn't as busy as other restaurants, so if you're looking for dim sum in this neighbourhood that doesn't have a lineup, then this would be a good alternative."}
{"text":"This is a very busy restaurant and it's also very authentic. We called ahead to come here with a party of approx 35 people. We had to wait a bit for them to clear off some tables. It seemed like they weren't that prepared. We walked upstairs and they had a semi private area for us. They had very large round tables for us. Not all the tables were fully set. Some were already sitting down. Some of the servers here do not speak english so the language barrier can be difficult. While some people were sitting down, there was a server that was speaking really loud in chinese and you can tell with her tone she was pissed off. My dad said that she was mad that more and more people were coming and sitting down. Not sure why she was getting so mad especially since the hostess walked us to that area and told us this is where we were going to eat at. That same server was so rude. You would ask her for a napkin or a straw and she would huff and puff.   The food was good. I didn't try all of it though. My favorite was the eggs and shrimp and the crispy pork. They would bring out each dish at each table for all of us to share. There was plenty of food for everyone.   Not sure if I would come back here again. Sure, the food was good but not good enough for the bad service."}
{"text":"Booked for 8:00PM. Never got seated until 8:30PM. They let the familiae customers sit before new customers. There is no point to make reservation."}
{"text":"I've been here for both dim sum and dinner. My wife and I were here for dim sum, and it was simply disappointing. Only one out of the six things we ordered came prepared properly. We were not planning to come back, but my father-in-law insisted in giving this place another try, so we did. The dinner experience was a LOT better. The food were all above average at a very reasonable price. They have a special in right now where the Double Boiled Fresh Milk Mixed with Egg White in Papaya is $2.8/person on Saturday, Sunday, and Public Holidays. They did this desert justice. It was done properly, and was very tasty."}
{"text":"I really like their dim sum. Lots of fried dishes that you can try out on top of the dim sum staples like har-gao and siu-mai.   Pro tip: There is ground floor, 2nd floor and basement but only ground floor is wheelchair accessible. They don't usually open basement for morning and lunch hours unless it's super busy. Be sure to ask for the which floor you prefer when you get there"}
{"text":"The restaurant was super busy last night with many families here celebrating Chinese New Year's Eve.  Reservations were only available for 6pm and 8pm. Our reservation was for 8pm which wasn't the best idea.  It was nice that the staff didn't make people leave at 8pm but not good for us.  It wasn't a long wait but we were all tired so it felt long.  The staff were working really hard and were very efficient with taking our orders quickly and helpful which made the rest of the evening very enjoyable.  We were a bit disappointed that they were sold out of beef tenderloin which my sister says it's really good.  The hostess recommended to get the Chinese broccoli with satay beef instead which was very tasty. All the dishes were really well prepared.  We really liked the deep fried fish dish which was lightly battered and was very sweet and juicy.  All in all we really enjoyed our dinner here!"}
{"text":"Dim sum review.  I've been here many times over a decade, but it's a different experience when I attend without my parents or family of 20!  I find the amount and quality of English speaking staff here is one of the better ones in the city, so it makes it really easy for anyone to come here and enjoy dim sum without bringing their translator friend.  $3 for small, medium, large dishes if you come before 11am which is pretty decent. The quality of food here is good-best, the amount per dish seems to be less i.e. 3 instead of 4 steamed dumplings or Chung fun looked like 2 long rolls/pieces cut into 4 servings vs standard 3 long pieces.   We were seated on the ground level which is nice with the huge vaulted ceilings and long Windows, the basement had mahjong games going on at 10:30am! I was wondering were they still here from last night or is breakfast Mak Jong a thing for retirees?? LoL  Redeeming factor- a lady served us our shrimp Chung fun(steamed rice roll) and it had a pronounced short fiber of hair garnishing the dish. When I pointed to it out nicely to my server, she was genuinely surprised and took it back without me needing to ask. The manager also came to inquire what happened and we clarified we did want the dish just not with hair! It came back fresh and hot and did not look like they just reheated the same dish.   Very nice place that changed decor over the years, all went well, great place to go for dim sum even if you are a newbie"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the GTA for dim sum! The quality is consistently good, the decor is nice, and service is great. The only thing I don't like is how it's often busy during lunch service and I get seated in the cramped downstairs area."}
{"text":"In my recent Toronto trip, this was probably my worst experience in the lot.  The only item I enjoyed was the Steamed Papaya w/ milk dessert toward the end.  Considering the place is trying to appease the upper crowd w/ supposedly good tasting high end dishes, sorry, but there are easily plenty of options at the mid end that will knock this out in the first round alone.  Some Yelpers who claim this to be good Cantonese must have experienced a different kitchen team than I had.  Service was definitely subpar and weak on the front dining side.  Advice to management:  do not hire wait staff that keeps yapping non stop about their personal lives vs doing an efficient job of taking care of the patrons, it shows a lack of respect and courtesy to paying customers who do NOT want to hear the non stop chattering of non sense.  Wait staff like this belongs to a cheap eats establishment, not a supposedly higher end eatery.  At this rate, the place will be shut down or sold to another within 6 months considering how high rent must be in this Food Hall Mall."}
{"text":"Review on the dim sum.   I came here with my family for dim sum on a Sunday. I found the service to be efficient and accommodating as my aunt would ask for the multiple sauces etc.   However, the dim sum was average and the pastry sizes seemed small to me. The cost was $2.90 per dish before 11am. Overall the experience was underwhelming. We were seated at the top level which had booth seating as well as a couple bigger tables. I would recommend being upstairs as the service seemed better and it was quieter. I've had better dim sum elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day and I was not impressed. Upon walking in the place felt extremely overcrowded. The waitress seemed annoyed the moment we walked in and briskly seated us at an empty table. Someone then came over to set the table... We had to ask twice for the dim sum menu and they didn't have standard things like xiao long bao which I thought was odd. When our food arrived, everything was only okay. Nothing in particular stood out and I was turned off by the service which was slow and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Dinner Experience at Richlane was a disappointing 2 Star.  I would suggest just stick with dim sum especially their Early Bird and Later Afternoon Specials which I been for a few times and always been excellent.  For the Good:  - Lobster at $11.80/lb cooked whatever way requested. Lobster can be as small as 2.5 lb and that is perfect for 2 people to share (I can eat the whole thing myself) - I received a voucher during dim sum for a free Double Boiled Shark Fin Soup with Vegetable and Chicken ($16.80). I am not into shark fin but dinner mate thought it was the best item we ate during our meal - The dessert pastry which is complimentary were really good  For the Bad:  - I now officially ate the worse Sweet and Sour Pork in my life. So bad I feel like just ordering this dish and make the Head Chef and Head Waiter just to eat and finish this dish so they can experience the same thing. The batter was heavy and hard, the pork was just basically chunks of fat! I ate a few pieces and ended up splitting them out! ??????? Sweet and Sour Pork w/Pineapple Served in Crispy Noodle Bowl ($13.80) did have this good presentation but avoid at all cost! Don't eat it even it is free!! - I did tell the wait staff about my SS Pork but they kind of just brushed me off and would just let the kitchen knows. - Food was mostly salty and loaded with MSG. I was thirsty the whole night - One of the waiter kept swearing in Chinese behind the partition and the customers can clearly hear every words he said and Richlane supposed to be a higher end restaurant at least according to the price they are charging?   Richlane does have a lot of potential. I sincerely wish that it has thing sorted out and the food would worth the price they are charging! For now it is a pass for dinner..."}
{"text":"The steam chicken is the best since I left China. Snow pea chute is most delicately prepared.  Outstanding services.  Very tasteful atmosphere. If you enjoy fine dining Cantonese food, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came for dim sum lunch with co-workers.  While the outside does not look anything special, the interior looks very nice with high ceiling and classy decoration.  We ordered 6 dim sum to share among the 3 of us.  The food was generally delicious, except the squid had a taste of alkaline water residue.  The congee was decent but had a tiny little bit too much MSG.  The services was polite.  The food came out a little bit slow but not overly so.  I think customers who don't need to rush back to office won't feel the difference.  Overall 3.5 stars for dim sum lunch."}
{"text":"warning restaurant is closed because it's  under construction as of march 2018  Brought my family there after driving for 30mins sadly it's not listed anywhere that the restaurant is under renovation thus it is closed"}
