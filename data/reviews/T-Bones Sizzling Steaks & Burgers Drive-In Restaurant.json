{"text":"red meat.  

if those two words have turned you off already, then please don't read any further.

24 hour steak.  yes.  24 hour.  so let me ask you.  what are your expectations?  what kind of service do you want?  would you like wine with your meal?  perhaps white linen napkins?  look, if you even have to answer ANY of those questions, then this place is NOT for you.  

i don't remember who introduced me to this place, years ago, but i'm still very thankful that it's still here today, and that the staff have not changed over much.  i've brought my own slew of guests, to introduce them to this rustic looking gem.  some like it, some don't.  

being in the food and beverage industry, and having to deal with health codes, etc..., but there's a time and place for those nit-pickers.  this again, is NOT it.

i don't CARE that the tables and chairs don't match.  i don't CARE if i have to grab my food when i'm told to.  i don't CARE that only in recent times have they started to wear a uniform, and not bloody aprons (which i love to see anyway, 'cause i love hard workers).  and i sure as hell don't CARE if they don't smile at me, at 2-3am, when i'm undecided on my meal of choice.

what i DO care about, is my meat.  my red meat.  i don't care much about the condition of the fridge that it's in.  i don't care much about what \"grade\" it is.  but what i DO care about, is the temperature at which i request for it to be at.  and let me tell you this.  if there's a secret that they have, to cooking the steaks as perfect temperature as requested, they need to teach the KEG.  

so yes.  it's a little further away from downtown toronto.  but if you're a west-ender that won't take the effort to drive east, then stay to the west.  it'll save me the pleasure of waiting behind you, as your eyes glaze over the selection offered.

price?  can't be beat.  taste?  it tastes like meat.  which is exactly what it's supposed to taste like.  sides/extras? don't be picky.   if you need to eat this, you need a bigger slab of meat next time...

i've worked fine dining restaurants, i would like to think that i know what food is all about.  but this past september, on my birthday, THIS is where i had my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Dirty Dirty Dirty, I drive pass this place all the time and since love a good home burger I decided to try T Bones out. From the outside it looks like an awesome burger join but go inside and woe this place gives a whole new meaning to the word greasy spoon. This place looks like it has never been cleaned since it opened every thing is covered with grease from the fryers yuk. The food was ok, the burger was dry I could tell that i was just heated up and was pre cooked since you cant cook a burger from raw in 2 minutes. Ate thier once never again."}
{"text":"Nicely cooked to what you order, old school feel, good price for steak salad fries and gravy. Repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful well sunlit fresh environment to enjoy a spectacular steak at s very good price. Awesome experience I would recommend to all and please... three thumbs up, I would give 4 if I could!"}
{"text":"My first impressions for this restaurant was a bit low because of the appearance of the outside of the place. It seemed run down but I am assuming it is because they have been in business for so long.

I came with 2 others and I ordered the Steak Burger Combo with Fries and a Pop. Whereas the other 2 that I was with ordered the Steak Special that came with a 16 oz steak, Caeser salad and a choice of side. The cashier was very nice and made sure to ask all of us how we wanted our steak. 

The meals were cheap for a steak restaurant my combo was only $6.75+ tax and the Steak Special was only 13.75+ tax. A meal like this would cost easily $25 or more at other places. 

The wait for the food was a bit long but I expected it because I ordered my steak well done. When the food came I was able to choose what to put on my burger and there was many options to choose from.

The washrooms were dirty but that was the only thing I found bad about the place.

The steak was well seasoned and the fries were VERY good. Overall I really like this place and recommend it to satisfy your steak craving at anytime of day(Since they are also 24 hours)."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews on this place, I was finally in the area to give this place a try.  I was actually excited and mouth was drooling as I got closer to the restaurant. 

Pulling up,  the place looked pretty run down (but that was expected).  Took a quick look inside just to make sure I was in right place.   You can smell the smoke and actually see it as you are walking in.   

$13.95 for a 20oz (might have been 16, can't remember) T-bone steak dinner (choice of potatoes with side salad and a little dinner roll).  Did not think twice about this deal.  Placed 2 orders with mushrooms and gravy.  The steak was seasoned and cooked very well.   The quality of the meat was another story.  You do get what you pay for (it was pretty tough)!  Good size salad and fries were pretty good as well. 

In terms of value for your money, very hard to beat this price and the quantity you get.  This will easily cost you well over $25 anywhere else.   

Will I come back... hard to say.  As of now, I do not think so.  Even though the price is awesome, I was a bit disappointed, left the place still hungry and mouth was tired from chewing so much.  I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, the quantity (and the price) was not enough to over come my disappointment in the meat.  I usually overlook the quality (as long as it is pretty decent) and focus on the value of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.   The food is too pricey for stale old frozen fries , buns , salad is just lettuce leaves that's wilted and old .....the staff is rude and the food is yucky.  Go to a better steak restaurant , don't waste your money here, The place is filthy and it's a dump."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not for the price they are asking. As of last week, the price of their burger combo (Fries and a homemade burger) with a large pop and gravy went from $10.15 to $12.60. 

The restaurant is dingy, the washrooms are a borderline health hazard and while the food is good it is not worth the money. I can go to other places and get a burger combo cheaper than I can here. 

They had a steak special (sirloin steak with two sides) that was $13.99 last week and it was jacked up to $17.99 as of May 20th 2016 just as was the case with the aforementioned burger combo. I can go to Jack Astors, or other places and get a steak and a side for a couple dollars more if not the same price and have it be of higher quality in a nicer place. 

This place was great but since they jacked up their prices on May 20th 2016 it is no longer worth it. The food is good but not that good. 

The manager of T-Bones does not care anymore.. all he does is sit and watch TV in the restaurant. I have it on good authority from current and former staff that he pays the staff under the table in cash. 

The washrooms are falling apart with urinals inoperable for months and tiles coming up all over the place. The ventilation is not always working so the place fills up with smoke when it gets busy making it hard to breath. 

Don't waste your money. Go to Mamas boys at Birchmount and Danforth. The food is better and it is cheaper."}
{"text":"Bro tbonez is so lit. I went here a week ago with my boys after we smashed a bless up session at the gym. It was around 1 am on a Monday morning  and everywhere else was closed. Good thing bout t bones is that it's open 24/7 #blessup. K so we got to tbonez and I was wondering what to get. The Guyanese waiter came out to take our order so I asked her what's good and she replied everything LOL. she was mad friendly/funny I would LOWKEY come back just for her. Anyways I got a steak burger with onion rings and it was honestly so bless like. The steak was moist. Which is hard to expect from a steak burger and with the price point it's definitely a place to be recommended. 5/5 will come again."}
{"text":"A clutch place if your hungry for red meat in the we hours. Service is fine, woman taking the orders can be pushy. Steaks for the past 2 times were under cooked asked for medium got it medium rare or even less. Mashed potatoes are average at best as well as the salad. Stick with the fries for your potatoes side. Feels like your eating in a cafeteria ."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but, recently I purchased a burger from there and it was a tad flavourless.  The steak combo isn't too bad for the price and you can get it anytime of day or night.  I still think although I had one bad burger there they still make great ones, and they're massive!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally found this place on Google, but it appealed to me because it look like my kind of place, a non fancy place that serves up delicious food at pedestrian prices. So I decided to try it.
I guess you could say that this place is ghetto, but I like these kind of places. I ordered a ribeye steak dinner. I must say it was ready pretty quickly. The steak is served with a small side of butter. The steak was actually really good. However it was the sides that I didn't like. The mashed potatoes were bland, and the salad was actually disgusting. That's why I gave 3 stars. I might go again, because like I said the steak was very good."}
{"text":"Terrible.

I was in from out of town and came here at 5 am with a coworker. This was too early for breakfast, apparently. I wasn't expecting much, and my expectations were still too high.

He got a home burger, which was burnt and dry, and fries which were smothered in grease. He got a diet fountain coke, which had not enough syrup and was mostly water.

I got a 12 oz ribeye which was at least 4 oz of fat, salad, which was barely tolerable, and mash which was partially cold.

Not at all impressed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"totally roasted MEDIUM ribeye, they explained it was caused by the fat???

the price is low, but the quality and environment are very bad.

don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Very nice prices on steaks, burgers, and chicken souvlaki that's made to order in a timely fashion. The interior itself is nothing to write home about, but it does have a certain old-timey diner in the middle of nowhere, Scarborough, charm to it. The food is not bad for what it is and I still recommend it to friends who are visiting the area.

I'd suggest you give it a try if you're in the area and craving something filling to eat."}
{"text":"Food: 
For a restaurant located in a neighbourhood derived from a post-apocalyptic nightmare, the food was resoundingly satisfactory. I Ordered some monster-assed burger with bacon, cheese and some greenery. Fries and gravy also made their way on to my plate, although I don't recall ordering them. Most likely because I had been hammering back Molson at the Strip Club across the street.

Atmosphere: 
You know how when you're driving through Baltimore or Detroit on the Interstate, and you're like \"Hmm...I wonder what goes on down there..\" But you just keep driving. T Bones is the answer to that question, delivered with a huge side of Scarborough.

The fellas and I waltzed in at 2am on a Friday night, and there had to be 30 people in there. It was like a film shoot for The Wire, but no director was around to yell cut. There were however many people around to yell things like \"Ayyoo whurr my fuckin burger at Ni**a\", and \"Yo, I recognize that muh'fucka from jail. He owe me mad money.\" Etc. There was a full on argument in the back about who stole the ketchup from whose table, Hint: Apparently it was 'Dat Bitch ass ni**a right there.\"

It was like a circus. The two people working there didn't give a fuck, which is great because my food preparation requires your full goddam attention. The best part was when 4 cops came in to order food, and they got heckled from the 10 minutes it took to get their food. If we lived in Missouri, everyone in that restaurant would have been killed.

I would deinfitely go back, because T-Bones isnt just about the food, it's about the experience. Bring a friend, bring a loved one, and just enjoy the atmosphere. Also, leave your chains/wallets in the car."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always good.  $15 for 16oz steak, you simply can't go wrong.  

If you want to reduce the carb and fat on their monster meal, get their tbone with rice.  Skip their mash potatoes with gravy; they're hella greasy!

Don't wear anything that you need to dry clean. Inside is super smokey so you will walk out smelling like BBQ fest.  Place is a little ghetto but still fairly clean and the ppl are quite friendly.

Good luck!"}
{"text":"I frequent T-Bones every other full-moon or so, whenever I have a craving for cheap steak. The $11 (16 ounce) steak special is about $13+ now but I've paid more than that for a poutine (it was fois gras, but I digress). You can check out the other reviews regarding the décor or the \"sketchiness\" of the place and the \"interesting\" people you meet there in the late evenings/early mornings, but I want to focus on the food.

16 once Steak Special w/ mashed potatoes & gravy - the steak cooked medium rare was just as it should be. Sure it's not the finest steak you'll ever have, nor will it be aged to perfection but it is decent for its price (even with the increase) and it does satisfy that inner-cave-man craving for cooked meat. They charge extra for gravy, mushroom and onions. The gravy is ok and the onions are always a good match with the steak (just note that it's really oily and you can definitely taste the oil as opposed to the sweet sautéed onion flavor) but do NOT (I repeat) do NOT order the side mushrooms. Unless you don't know what a mushroom is and you have a distinct taste for salty CANNED mushrooms with an aftertaste of arm-pit sweat, don't be fooled into thinking you'll get Keg-like quality mushrooms (yes I love mushrooms and feel strongly about it :P).

2 Pork Chops Dinner - the pork chop was a little dry for my taste but the fatty parts that they left on the pork chop helped add moisture and tenderness to the meat. It wasn't that flavourful but I do like my pork chops even if it's just seasoned with salt and pepper. I wish they had chicken-fried-pork chops at T-Bones...one can only dream.

Is this place an ideal first-date locale? Probably not. Unless she's awesome and can enjoy a good value meal with good company and can finish a 16 once steak with grace and poise...then she's a keeper ;)

I give this place ***1/2 stars."}
{"text":"The food really good for the price, all the staff there were really polite except for the bald Asian man working there happened to be behaving in an extremely rude, childish and discriminator manner while taking our order."}
{"text":"This place gives what every person wants when they go out for some good food.  Quality, friendliness, tenderness, freshness and value!  I've been going since they've opened and hope to see another location open in North York in the future."}
{"text":"Good price for what you're getting. Not the best steak ever but the price is damn near unbeatable. Also helps that this place is open 24/7, staff is quite friendly as well. Go go go."}
{"text":"A place that you can get a steak dinner for a good price."}
{"text":"Okay...So...One hot summer night, many years ago, I was craving a sizzling steak in the middle of the night!  I wanted seared meat so badly, it felt like my Fangs were getting longer! Honest to God, I felt like I was actually turning into a WOLF! (Perhaps it was even a Full Moon that night!) That's when I remembered T-BONES Drive-In Restaurant!  
I had driven past T-Bones many times in the past, inhaling the smell of the grill from my speeding car. I recall pulling a wicked U-Turn in the middle of the road just to finally get into this joint!  T-Bones is nothing much to look at on the inside, but don't let the lousy cafeteria decor fool you! ~ The quality of the Steak makes up for it. Let's face it, a 16 ounce Rib Eye for $17 bucks is a pretty great deal, any way you cut it. When it's grilled perfectly, done Medium-Rare, and seasoned right, a steak is a wonderful thing. That first steak I got from T-Bones was fantastic! So good in fact, that I'm writing about it 14 years later!  Open 24 hours, T-Bones is another one of those Toronto Restaurants that's perfect to hit after a late night of whatever... 
Located way out in Scarberia, T-Bones is a bit of a hike if you don't happen to live in the area. The good food makes it worth the trip tho. Overall, the place must lose one Red Star for it's dive-bomb interior; But I need to return, to see if the Steak alone can get that 5th Star back up on the board! 
***UPDATE:  Of course I have been back to T-Bones a bunch of times for that killer Steak dinner. Most recently in January of 2017. Nothing has changed. The staff was still friendly and nice! The owner smiled and said hello that night. The interior still looks like a worn-out old truck-stop. Conversely, the garden salad was fresh, the potatoes and gravy were fine, and most importantly, my medium-rare Steak was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of an acquaintance.
Had a NewYork steak, mushrooms garden salad and roast potato for about $15. Ordered steak rare - delivered medium-well and luke-warm; mushrooms from a tin; roast potatoes barely warm; garden salad good. You get what you pay for, I'd rather pay more and get more. 
I'll not be there for a steak again, maybe a hamburger some day."}
{"text":"Good food great price... They just need a little renovation inside the resto... but their food like i said, its gooood!"}
{"text":"Food is just nasty. Don't care if it's 24 hours or not,it's nasty. Homemade burger wasn't cooked properly, was pink inside, the bun was cold.  I went there previously for a fries and gravy and ended up waiting 25 minutes. They took my money and forgot I had ordered the fries. He said he would give me more for the wait, turns out more to him meant same amount in a bigger box. What a joke. Place is outdated and slightly trashy. Wouldn't go there again. Not worth the money especially after the price increase."}
{"text":"Don't do it. I tried the chicken souvlaki and it was the worst Greek meal I've ever had. The chicken was old and dry and tasteless. The potatoes were orange (?) and bland. The best thing was the Greek salad, which was mostly lettuce. Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. Even McDonalds would have been better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. The steaks were always good growing up. Now the quality of steaks have gone down the drain. The steak was horrible...and steak is my favourite food. I knew something wasn't right when I cut into it... it looked off but I ate anyways after my meal I went to the bathroom and vomited. Thanks t bone for your disappointing visit! Won't ever be back again."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - the interior is dirtier than it looks in the pictures.  Though I see a dedicated staff cleaning after people's tables, no amount of wiping will make this dated, grimy diner clean enough.  The tables and chairs feel sticky to the touch, the wooden chairs look like antiques, the overhead lights have dust/bugs all over, the list is endless.  Also, as I walked in today the place was very smoky to a almost hazardous amount, though i see that this is not mentioned in the other reviews.  This could be a one-off incident but I genuinely worry about the staffs' health if they work in the same smoky environment every day.

For all the reasons listed above, the prices here are cheap for what it is - a 16oz steak dinner special at $17.99 including a side of salad/fries.  (This seems to differ from previous reviews that it's supposed to be $14.99 which would have been an even better deal) Your pick up your food on a cafeteria tray.  We ordered medium rare and worried slightly that we might get sick.  In the end, quality for everything is passable - steak was fairly juicy and the fries were better than expected.  

For 2 people sharing a meal, we ended up paying about $25 with a drink.  This is pretty cheap, but only slightly cheaper than an actual restaurant with cleaner tables and actual service.  It's definitely convenient that it's open 24hr."}
{"text":"I have no clue why the other reviewers are so critical of this place. It is a no wait staff kind of Diner, very unlikely that you will be pampered when you are eating there. A juicy piece of 12 oz Steak, a generous amount of sides and a soft drink for about $20....and what?!? Open 24/7!!! What more can you ask for!!! As for the reviewers who b*tch about the location for being unsafe, let me tell you something kids. You are more likely to get T-Boned in a car accident than get hurt at T-Bones."}
{"text":"24/7 steak, $11.99 for 16-oz with starch (rice, mashed potatoes, fries), dinner roll and salad, $5.99 for 8-oz steak sandwich with fries and pop... extra for gravy, mushrooms and Greek salad for your steak combo. Do not get the rice, it will most likely be undercooked. 

Steak is cooked as requested consistently. Had it from medium rare to well done - medium rare is obviously tastier for a true red meat lover, but sometimes well done is a better choice if you don't want to struggle with some extra fatty bits in your steak. Yes, it is not the top quality meat but where else can you get so much steak at that price, and any steak at ungodly hours of the night when T-Bones is most packed? Tasty enough that I have seen guys arrive in cabs?!

The place is somewhat clean but in disrepair, and its sketchy appearance can be further complemented by various interesting characters that frequent the joint late at night, such as (1) a guy high as a kite waiting for his food next to you, asking you \"Did you see that? I swear I just saw a ghost? You sure you didn't see a ghost???\" repeatedly while looking around with a scared facial expression (2) two girls that are obviously strippers at one of the sketchy Scarborough clubs, trash talking you out of nowhere, or (3) a group of a dozen or so guys in their late twenties/early thirties having rap battle in front of the entrance, but nicely opening the door for people walking in. Not really dangerous per se, and I never felt threatened, but it can get interesting with drunk people after last cal on weekends - plenty of cops get their grub on here, too.

I was introduced to this place during university, and apparently the owners opened it based on personal frustrations on not being able to get any good food late at night when in school. Would not study here (washrooms are not that clean and you cannot drink your own water), but great to fill up after a long night or two when nothing even close to nutritious food can be had.

Overall, great value for tasty steak anytime you want, any way you want it, but don't expect anything more than that. Also, they accept debit but no credit cards."}
{"text":"i have had and enjoyed the burgers here but tonight I had the worst meal ever. Ordered Chicken souvlaki dinner and did not know they use fatty chicken thighs. Im sorry but dark meat fatty chicken does not cut it. Salad was mediocre all in all just a horrible dinner. Won't repeat."}
{"text":"T-bone steak is delicious. I have only ever tried their bacon cheeseburgers and their steak special. The bacon cheeseburger comes with fries (as per the meal), with a variety of toppings. The steak special comes with a starch, a bun and salad. They have a large variety of dressing for the salad. The mash potatoes with gravy is a must have! 

My steak was delicious. I like my steak medium rare, so it was very flavourful and juicy. The fries are also good, the salad and bun is standard. The bacon cheeseburger is also very delicious! But between the two, I think the steak tastes better, but this could just be a personal preference. 

The restaurant is a diner, so you aren't getting restaurant service, but this is why the food is cheaper. The staff is quite friendly, and for the price, you can't go wrong. You are surly getting bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"T-bones has it's allure. The staff are friendly, the food is comforting, and there's just something about steak late at night that makes me come back. The owner is extremely friendly. 

The chicken souvlaki is bomb here. I usually get the steak special which is a NY strip with a multi grain or white bread and salad. Whether you place an order to go or sit in it's worth it. The poutine is good here. The onion rings are crispy. The fries are made in house which make them taste good. 

Whether you're seeking a late night snack, dinner, lunch, or breakfast this place is a go to with fairly good prices."}
{"text":"The building is not hard to find. It has a big sign with its name on it and is its own building. 

This isn't your usual steak house, steak joint. The seating seems more like a fast food place and is a bit dated. However, the food and price makes up for it! For $13.50 we got a 16oz steak with a salad and a choice of fries mashed potatoes or baked potatoes (If I remember correctly). This was enough to fill me and my friend, one order. That may be because we both don't eat a lot, but it was enough. We were surprised. 

We asked for medium rare. The steak was not cooked evenly throughout but it was still good and edible. Some parts were more cooked and some parts less. It wasn't because of the thickness of the steak either. But it was still tasty! Surprisingly minimal fat. 

Oh, we ordered the rib eye. Would definitely recommend this place to all the meat eaters! Will be going back soon :) for the price, this is an amazing place."}
{"text":"OMG thats all i can say , it was sooooo goooood , i have never been there untill tonight , it was so good , i compley mastered my burger , i have never ate a meal like how i did when i went there ..... like i said it was sooooooo good .

enjoy its a must go to restaurant ."}
{"text":"Came here on a random Friday afternoon for lunch. For those of you that have never been here before, it's a casual order from the counter steakhouse.  Menu rangers from fish & chips to pork chops to burgers to steaks.  They even do steak & eggs in the morning.

I ordered their steak special, which was a 16oz striploins w/ Caesar salad, rice and bread.  It was only $17.99!  Food was decent!  I ordered med rare and it was just a tad overcooked.

Service was average, nothing special.  Don't expect a fine dining experience.

To end, good food, decent service and great value!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this place sucks now.  Ten plus years ago this place was great, but now the burger has virtually no flavour, the oil for the fryer is old(fries shouldn't be that brown looking) and the cut of steaks is average.  Yet another place surviving on it's reputation."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love steak, and I like T-Bones because I can get a steak 24 hours a day at a really low price.
Sure the decor is kind of like your high school cafeteria, and food is served in much the same manner, but we're talking a 16 oz steak dinner for under $15. That includes the fries, salad and bun. Hard to go wrong. Maybe the steak is not the quality of the Jacobs or even The Keg, and maybe the cooking is somewhat erratic, but it is under $15, so it's all about value.
In case you think it's all about the steaks, they have great burgers. My kids love their burgers, and they are perennial \"Best of Scarborough\" winners in the burger category. The 8 oz sirloin burger is made in-house, and it's big, greasy and delicious! 
And to start your day off right, load up on the steak and eggs.
Absolutely the best hangover or late night munchies spot."}
{"text":"Cheap steaks 24/7. This is the place to be if you want to bite into some late-night steaks. The decor reminds me of a 90's Country Style and the washrooms are disgusting. They also seem to have a really bad ventilation system, so the whole place is full of smoke when it's busy. But, if you can get by all those hurdles, you will be rewarded with a decent (okay, average) quality steak for under $20."}
{"text":"You definitely don't come here for the atmosphere but for the price for steak, you can't beat it. I had the 8 oz York sirloin steak which came with a huge serving of potatoes and salad. The potatoes were not roasted but more boiled/steamed with lots of sauce on it. However, it did not deter from what we got. I ended up sharing with my husband who got the chef salad with grilled chicken.  The chef salad is left to be desired as its just mainly iceberg lettuce with some sliced tomatoes and cucumber. But its worth it for the steak.  As well, be careful that when you need to add fried onions and mushroom on top of the steak, they charge extra. We were charged extra and realized near the end of the meal, there were no fried onions or mushroom on it which made us leaving slightly disappointed that we got a bit ripped off."}
{"text":"Yeah, 99% of your bill is going directly to the food. The place is beyond worn out and dingy, poor ventilation, order at the counter, etc..

BUT, for a price point only slightly higher than a combo at McDonald's you're getting a nice decent quality, large steak. That comes with a bun, salad and choice of potato (baked, mashed, fries). 

The steak was better than I'd anticipated, was cooked just how I ordered it and done on a charcoal no less. Basic garden salad, but at least it was fresh. Passable mashed potatoes which were genuine and not from a mix.

Honestly, I'm a value junkie and almost tempted to award it 5; but it would be a bit of a stretch to say it's a 5 star plate. Still, a nice steak and passable sides for really cheap...just don't make it a date night spot."}
{"text":"Great steaks for low prices! My bf is a meat lover and he loves this place.  Nowhere else he can order a 32oz sirloin with sides for $26.99.  Quality of steak is good.  Love that it's open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Definitely a good value. The 16oz steak is flavourful and tender. Comes with a salad and another side of your choice . too bad it's far from my house. Would love to visit more often."}
{"text":"You know what, for a fast food restaurant that serves steak at such a cheap price AND has great service, I'm gonna give this place 4 stars.

While steak shouldn't be an \"everyday\" kind of food, I think this place makes itself a really tempting and convenient option for a \"budget date night\" or \"treat yourself night\". For a heaping amount of food (2 scoops of mash potatoes, Caesar salad, a bun, and 16 oz New York Sirloin steak), you only have to drop a $20 bill and you're golden.

In terms of the quality of the food, I was actually surprised with it being better than I had thought (considering the price). Surely, you get what you pay for but by no means is the food bad! I had shared the 16 oz with a friend and we finished everything on the plate. I was also pleasantly surprised by the kind gestures of the employees, who told us to leave our plates and trays behind as they would take care of cleaning up after us. For a fast food restaurant where you pay up at the front, you don't typically get that kind of service!

I guess my only notable point of criticism is that the ventilation needs to improve. As soon as I walked in, I not only saw with my own eyes, but I also smelled and felt the cloud of smoke that lingered over our heads. It wasn't smoky enough to induce coughing but I definitely walked out of that place that night smelling like fast food."}
{"text":"A steak place that was different from others as this was more like a fast food joint. How can you go wrong with a $14.99 steak special that comes with salad and a side of mash, potatoes or fries!! 

Steak was cooked to my liking. Mash was a little cold, salad didnt have enough dressing. 

The only thing about this joint that i didnt like was how smokey it was as we dined in. Not sure if this is something on the regular or not but just make sure you prepare yourself for your ride home as you'll smell like smoke. Ill see you again!"}
{"text":"I haven't been there in a while so I can't fully tell if the prices have gone up, but if they have, that sucks. This place was always the go-to primarily for the cheap prices. I mean, if you've seen the restaurant, you shouldn't expect it to be better than average. 

I've come here a few times with friends, usually for very late night meals. The service is friendly which actually makes you want to be there. Sure, it's not the fanciest or nicest place, can be sketch, but, it's part of the charm. 

Steak is alright, fries are mad greasy, and the salads I find aren't that fresh. Again, this isn't my top dinner choice but for steak late at night, why not. The burgers are also decent.

I can't say I've been disappointed ever, but I also can't say that I'm always down to eat here. Still, it's one of those places you can count on being there when you're hungry and everything is closed or you're just feeling it."}
{"text":"Came here around 10:30pm on Tuesday night as I was craving for meat.  Nothing much has changed with this place for the past 2 decades. That's why I love coming here. You know exactly what to expect.

Decor is still the same. The steak quality is still the same. The portions are still huge. The lettuce they use for their salads are still drenched with water. At least you know they wash their veggies, but they should at least take the time to drain the water! That being said, at the price they charge for their food; one can't really be too demanding. 

We ordered the 16oz T- bone steak, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and a pork souvlaki with rice & fries.  I believe they changed up their fries.  Tastes much better! This was the first time I had their souvlaki and it was not dry at all. Tasted fine for lunch the next day. 

I'll be back; as I have over the decades.  But more for convenience than for  flavour."}
{"text":"*phew* if this isn't the dirtiest restaurant in the GTA, I'm not sure what is.   Brings me back to my university days where after a hard night of drinking this would be a perfect spot.  24 hour steak.

But dropping by for lunch... not so sure.  The grease stains on the signs must be 20 years old.  Flies everywhere.

Got a pretty mediocre burger.  

Most importantly.. I survived to write this review."}
{"text":"24/7 fast food style place. I find it kind of dirty to sit in here and it can get smoky inside. We ordered the steak special which was $14.99 for 16oz steak, salad, mash potatoes with gravy and a dinner roll. Price is great for the portion you get. Steak is good, but don't expect anymore for the price you pay. They also serve burgers and breakfast items. Do take-out to avoid the smoky and dirty setting"}
{"text":"Very good meat cuts but the steaks have no taste. Worst tasting steaks I ever had most probably. I just bring my own seasoning when I absolutely have to go there given nothing else is open. You can't compare it to let's say a moxies steak or a Montreal steak. It's comparable to a breakfast steak taste wise. Absolutely horrible taste.

Fries were soggy. Home fries are never cooked all the way in those big chunky cuts. Burgers are okay. Gravy is okay too.  But again, don't judge how a good steak taste like based on this place.

And oh the cashiers were rude and yelling too. They  never smile and get annoyed. I tip them all the time hoping they have a better day.

Place is kinda sketchy. Saw many rats running around outside meaning they live inside."}
{"text":"Wow,  I have not come down here for years!  It's still the same old place. Smokey, dingy and old 70 's/80's charm. Lol. The only things that change its the counter staff and cooks. I got nosy and asked the cashier if it changed management, but she says it's still the same old boss, but he comes down once in awhile.

I was really craving for meat on Saturday night and I just happened to remember this place. 

I always can't resist the Sirloin Steak Special.  16 oz Sirloin, salad, potatoes(mash or roast ) and a dinner roll all for $12.95.  WOW WHEE. Anything extra is charged. Like gravy, mushrooms, onions and drinks. 
The steak is not melt in your mouth type and it's naturally flamed grilled. It tasted pretty good actually ! Better then having me cooking over a hot grill making all that stuffs. Lol. 
 
I will for sure be back for more! YUMMY!

Oh, did I mention?  It's open 24 hours!!!!!



Place is a dive but if you want to eat meat at a cheap price. This is the place to go"}
{"text":"Other than stripping naked before going in, there's no way to avoid smelling like grilled steak. You are what you eat right (literally)? They need to invest in better range hoods to exhaust the grill smoke! The steak itself is mediocre, but then again this isn't some $50+ steakhouse. The steak is a little chewy at times; not the melt in your mouth kind. But I'll visit again to hang out with buddies, or feeling like heavy protein at 3am in the morning. This is defiantly not a first date kind of place, maybe second or third date :)"}
{"text":"I used to pass here on the bus all the time, and would treat myself to the burger special (with fries and gravy) whenever I had a rough day.
I have since moved, and pass this place once in a blue moon, but I still crave the burger special, so good, one of the few places that don't use frozen patties, great gravy too"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for... Steaks are cheap and are ok at best.

Hubby got the 8oz sirloin with fries, salad and a bun on the side.  Would definitely not recommend the cut. Wifey on the other hand was quite pleased with the 12oz rib eye and had mushrooms, salad, mash with gravy, and a bun on the side. Both meals came out to $30.

If all you're craving is a slab of meat and you're on a tight budget, this place will satisfy."}
{"text":"T-Bones is somewhat of a Scarborough institution that I finally got around to checking out. T-Bones is an old school type of drive-in that is serving up some big hunks of steak as well as burgers, breakfast, sausages etc. all at insanely cheap prices. 

This place is located in a sketchy area of Scarborough, one that I would not recommend visiting in the middle of the night (although if you are having a steak craving at 3am, this place is open 24hours). The set-up is similar to that of a fast food chain, go up to the counter, order and wait for your number to be called. On this occasion I was not overly hungry so I opted for the 8oz New York strip which comes with a chef's salad and your choice of sides, I went for the roast potatoes. I also added some sautéed mushrooms to my steak, with the mushroom addition my total bill came to $12 and change. 

The best part of the meal was my steak, for those expecting AAA 30 day aged Angus beef, T-Bones is not for you. What I did receive however was a simple and honest hunk of meat cooked to a perfect medium rare just like I wanted. The steak was simply seasoned, had some nice grill marks and was not tough at all (although it did not melt in my mouth). The sides were a little sad though; the chef's salad probably came out of a bag and was topped with my choice of dressing, the sautéed mushrooms were clearly from a can which was disappointing. The roast potatoes were piled high on my plate and served in a red sauce. The potatoes were quite bland and not quite as tender as I would have preferred, although they did serve the purpose of filling me up. 

The service was friendly and my steak was prepared quickly. Next time I must come with a big appetite as they do offer 16oz steaks for under $15 and they even have 32oz steaks for the ultra hungry. The place itself was a little run down but was clean enough for a Scarborough drive-in. Overall T-Bones is a throwback place giving you bang for your buck, you will not get the white table cloth service and high quality meat but you will get value and a perfectly cooked steak."}
{"text":"Not the most romantic place to go for a Valentine's Day date, but hey we're not 4-star fine dining people. 11:30 at night back from downtown and we were hungry!

After our long walk through Eaton Centre, down south to the Air Canada Centre for the NBA All-Star Game, walk to Harbourfront then back to Scarborough with the TTC, did we decide to get some steak! T-Bones has been on my bookmark list for a while and definitely worth a try. As long as you like good cooked food for fair price, you'll be happy. Our steaks were flavorful, tender and very nicely cooked. 8oz Ribeye dinner for $11.99 and a 12oz New York Sirloin for $12.99. Steaks come with choice of fries, rice or mashed potatoes with a side of salad."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for years. It's been the go to place for cheap steaks in lower Scarborough since Kally's restaurant left the area over 10 years ago.

When I go I usually order a 12 oz New York or Rib eye medium rare for $9.99 and the price includes your choice of rice, roasted potatoes or fries with a salad and dinner roll. I usually ask for fries or the roasted prices because the rice is ALWAYS undercooked and hard. Keep in mind, if the cashier asks if you want mushrooms or onions, it is an additional charge.

The steak like a previous poster mentioned is definitely not AAA grade but it's really good value for your money and it will satisfy your steak craving. The food is made pretty quick, your given a number and once your meal is ready, they call out your number and you pick it up at the counter.

The place has been around forever and in my opinion has become a staple in Scarborough. Even though I grew up in Scarborough, even I have to say that the location is really sketchy and the place is dirty. The floor tiles are cracked and the washrooms are fifthy even for Scarborough. I'm pretty sure the place is profitable but no money in all the years I have been frequenting this place has gone to making the place more presentable, essentially, replacing the cracked tiles which are a safety hazard (people tripping over them) and cleaning up the washrooms. 

The food is a 3 star rating but the cleanliness and decor is a 1.5."}
{"text":"Kayra joined Chris and I for lunch today. Reminded me of the 70's style restaurants, so I used Kodak Ektachrome 100G film simulation. Cheers. Chris said it was the best steak under $30.00, he paid $14. I had the best fish and chips under $20, I paid $10."}
{"text":"Nothing satisfies a craving like that 2 AM 16oz NY Steak.  Some of you might say Poutine or Chinese but for me the choice is clear.  Not the 8oz, not the 12oz but the 16oz is the ONLY choice.

Apparently a bunch of guys came in shortly after I dug in to my meal.  It's probably from a night of Rumours Night Club or the Strip Club next to Rumours.  Yeah, you're right!  They were all guys, so it's definitely the Strip Club.  I'm probably right in saying the Steaks here sizzled more than the place they were coming from.

16oz NY Steak(Potato option, side Caesar, Dinner Roll - $11.99)

My Steak was prepared Medium that I've requested maybe slightly less so but it was apparent that it was seasoned well.  Nothing negative to comment on the sides.  I've had BURGER combos that cost more than this Steak Meal, so you know how I think of this in terms of value.

T-Bones use to be a late-night spot back in highschool when we were \"studying\" late.  It's been awhile and I've seen some dark times, literally as the lighting was weak at one point.  I've noticed some relative improvement as the women cashier was quite friendly and the dining area while still nothing special is more acceptable.

Maybe I'm OD'd on Steak, maybe it's early in the morning...."}
{"text":"For what you pay for, this meal is pretty good. I ordered their burger + fries combo ($5.99), added a large soda ($2.50) and some gravy ($0.69) - my meal came out to be $10.15. Fries weren't great; they were a bit soggy. Burger wasn't moist, but it wasn't dry; I can't really complain since the actual size of the burger was quite generous (8 oz). My dinner mates ordered a 16 oz steak + potato + salad combo for, I think, around $15. 

At first glance, this place seemed to typify Scarborough restaurants (in my opinion); the decor seemed to be at least a couple decades old, the room was smoky (from the grilling), and the lighting was somewhat dim. However, the place was quite filled for a Thursday evening and they had a decent sized lineup going on; suggesting that this place is a regular spot for people who live in the area.

Now, the women's bathroom - there was one stall in operation and the lock was broken. The door wasn't even properly aligned with the stall wall so I had to actually force the door closed. The two soap dispensers next to the sink weren't actually filled with soap; instead, the soap was in a mustard squeeze bottle. Their bathroom situation didn't affect my rating - I just thought it was interesting that they have two soap dispensers but opted to use a squeeze bottle instead. 

While I wouldn't make a special trip to come back here, I wouldn't refuse to come back if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"Just awesome steak! After I left Toronto I lived in Asia for two years and this is the most memorable food and first on my check list when back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Burger special, steak special, poutine are my usual orders. All great. Cheap prices. Very smokey inside, poor ventilation. 
Open 24 hours. 
I always go for a quick bite. 
Definitely not an ambiance kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a quick and delicious dinner if you are a meat lover! Super affordable steaks in different cuts also. The restaurant is definitely not the most appealing and one may think twice of eating there (I know I have) but this place offers so much for so little. You can get a full meal for less then $10-15 dollars! And these are legit steaks too! I can't believe it's taken us so long to try this place."}
{"text":"We entered the restaurant at 1050 and requested to have breakfast. There menu clearly states breakfast till 11am. They refused to take our order and told us that they all ready set up for lunch. I don't think  they understand the concept that when they say till 11am, It means that clients are allowed to order until 11am not that the food should cooked by 11am. 
Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Lots if parking. Decor a few decades past it's prime. Ventilation problem. Burger was generously large. Steaks looked big. Toilet had the gas station feel. Cashier was patient."}
{"text":"YAY! I AM A FAN. YAYAYAY.

When my boyfriend told me there was a place that serves huge steaks for under $15, I couldn't believe it. I'm too used to seeing 6oz steaks for $30+.. then I came here, and I was shocked. The place itself is pretty smokey inside and it looks like one of those restaurants that you go into when you're on a roadtrip at 2am. Not the best ambiance or the cleanest, but I can deal with that for cheap steak.

The steak special is my fave, even though I've never finished it. 16oz NY sirloin with side of mashed potatoes/fries, bread and caesar salad for $13ish. DAMNNNN. There's also other steak choices (rib eye, t-bone, chopped) and sizes. The place also sells burgers, breakfast and other stuff like that but I've never tried. HEY, going to a place where the steak is $12-13 and getting a burger is WEAK. AND THOSE WHO DO IT WILL NOT SURVIVE NATURAL SELECTION. 

The workers here are efficient and they move fast through orders and cooking it. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the area... it's so sketchy, I'm having thoughts that I may be robbed as I'm eating my meal. Also many sketchy and drunk people that come in (hey, let's be honest.. if I was drunk too and in the area, hell yeah I'd want a cheap steak meal!) I saw a drunk man in here once with a whole bottle of jack daniels stuffed into one jacket pocket and he was eating his steak by just grabbing it and stuffing it into his mouth. Savage. Then he proceeded to get into a fight with some other guy.. not a fan of shenanigans like that."}
{"text":"A mighty midnight snack or just a very late dinner and you're craving a big piece of meat this is where you come with the 11.99 special that comes with a 16 oz steak and a ceaser salad plus a choice of rice, mash, roast potatos and something else haha. I got the Greek salad ... BIG mistake it was pretty gross ): I didn't like it at all and we added the mushroom and onion to be adventurous but they were SOO heavily seasoned I could barely taste the actually mushroom but the steak was amazing ((: I asked for medium rare and boy was it cooked to the right point! I was looking out for bad meat and that foul smell that I've read in reviews from other sites but my friend and I were in luck! This place is definitely worth a try or a monthly visit.

The greek salad was a $1 extra.
The mushrooms was a $1 extra.
The onions were a 50 cents or 75 cents extra."}
{"text":"Do you want a Steak a large steak with all the trimmings for $12.95? If you do this is the place!

You simply step up to the counter make your choice, take a number, and take a seat. This is an old looking, family type restaurant with a really dated look. A few minutes later you number is called and you go to the counter and pick up your tray.

You will not be getting 28 days aged Canada AAA Black Angus Beef. Instead you will get a very nicely sized steak that is a bit tough but tasty. I don't know if they freeze the steak, but it sure tastes like they do.

The sides are filling, and their 'gravy' is pretty tasty. This is not the place to take you better half for on an Anniversary, or your mother-in-law for her birthday. If you want a decent, rapid, filling inexpensive 'feed', this could be the place for you.

No reservations necessary, just bring your appetite."}
{"text":"For cheap steak , this the place to go ,   for 15$ 2 person can easily eat one special order of steak. 
If they are busy there service is worst , but I often go there,  only 1 times I experienced that. Bergers and fish and chips is good too."}
{"text":"Deserves good stars, just for the fact that you can get a \"proper\" 16oz steak for under $15, i mean, how cool is that?

The steak was really good, might i say better than some of the very expensive ones i have had. We had NY steak, and it is the size of an elephant!

The gravy sauce on mashed potatoes is just yummyy!!

by no means does it look as fancy as most steakhouses, has a very retro feeling to it.
There is plenty of seating space so it is pretty good for good groups.

they will ask you for addons on your steak, like mushrooms and onions, I like the mushrooms, the onions were too sweet and oily.

It's self service, so you'd order a steak and pay, would be given an order number and get called out by the number.

did I mention that the place is 24/7? YES YES, you heard that right, you can have steak anytime your evil mind craves it! :D"}
{"text":"Total dive where the smoke from the grill fills the dining area. Cheap eats that you can get 24/7. Check their board for their specials that start at $7.99 which include fries and small size pop. 

I ordered the Sirloin burger with bacon and cheese which was dry and the veggie toppings weren't fresh. My hubby had the steak sandwich with grilled onions and mushrooms. I didn't like the taste of the onions and the mushrooms tasted like they were out of a can. The sandwich is not something we'd order again. For sides we had  the onion rings and fries both of which were crisp on the outside but greasy."}
{"text":"It's a burger joint built in the skeleton on a dead Wendy's  and it's as shady as that sounds.

Once you get past the scary area it's a decent burger at any time of the day so it's the kind of thing you should at least try."}
{"text":"This place is 24 hours, which is good. But I don't have a car so I hate my life. The fried mushrooms are really delicious and after 10pm, it seems to attract many intoxicated people. The fish and chips are huge, but they only gave me french fries. It really sucks to throw away the plastic red trays scattered with porcelain plates and silverware. I'm not sure if they clean up after you but that would be so douched so I won't assume. The parking lot is rather tight and only goes in a clock-wise fashion around the restaurant. The restrooms only had one stall and one urinal (in the mens at least).  I didn't really eat there persay because I am a pescatarian which yo como pescado. I actually had no idea what was going on."}
{"text":"okay okay okay . imagine this . its a weekend night, 2-3am, after clubbing, drinking, partying or whatever . youre starving . nothing will make you feel more content than saying NO to mcdonalds and perfect chinese restaurant and YES to 16oz medium rare steak w a side of mashed potatos & salad ! for $12 !!! woot ! after this late night meal, you'll be sleeping like a baby .

if you want to stay within budget, watch out and pay attention ! the cashier will ask you if you want all these extra stuff like gravy, sauteed mushrooms .. but what she wont be telling you is that they cost extra . i know, i know, we should all know that theyd cost extra, duhh, but trust me, she says its really quick & kind of sneaky AND when youre a bit drunk, you'll end up saying yes . extra costs add up !"}
{"text":"T-BONES! Wow this place is something.
It certainly looks dated from inside and out, people shooting a music video outside, sticky tables, wooden chairs and floors, and a large menu to satisfy some hungry bellies. This place is a time capsule! Thankfully this time around, we didn't have to inhale smoke from the grill with every bite. 

The food here is decently priced, and don't except anything fancy because this is a cafeteria style kind of joint. You order and pay at the front and wait for your number to be called. Open 24hrs, they have a variety of steaks, burgers as well as Fish & Chips on the menu. 

We usually order the 16oz Steak Special for $17.99 which comes with our choice of potatoes (Mashed is good), and a side Caesar Salad, as well as a dinner roll. Usually their steak is cooked a tad more than requested, so I usually go with rare which is more like medium rare. For under $20, this is a decent cut of steak and it'll sure fill up your belly. The Burger Special $7.99 is great too, compare that to McDonald's where the Big Mac is half the size! Their fries and rings are great, not too greasy. This place is great for a quick bite and some decent steak."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! The exterior reminded me of a place Smokey and Craig would go to for lunch in the movie Friday. My dad's friend took us to this joint while we were visiting TO. We immediately noticed that this place was an old Wendy's in a parking lot with cracked cement with weeds growing out of it.

The interior attempts to achieve a homey living room feel with in addition to whats left of the Wendys seats were whatever old tables and chairs they could put together. In addition there was a TV and some kids toys.

The steak was amazing and cheap! Nice juicy 16oz t-bone with two sides! Real good stuff for a great deal. Served with plenty of gravy which Canadians love."}
{"text":"The food is awesome!  The place can be a bit smokey from the grill, but it does not keep you from enjoying a wicked juicy steak or a awesome home made burger.  This place is always clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Worse steak ever!! Not even seasoned or marinated. Just slap on the grill and you need to drench it in a lot of sauce. The meat is very tuff. Mushroom is from the can."}
{"text":"This place opens 24/7! Although I don't recommend coming here very late because the area isn't so safe according to the news..

They offer best price for delicious steak combo! Tasty, fresh food, good price, casual hangout spot with friends."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for what it is.

A fast food type joint that serves cheap but delicious steaks. 

The decor of the place is really grungy and greasy, but you can't complain when you're getting good food for a good price.

16oz dinner is only $13.99! And it comes with potatoes and salad and a bun. You pay at the counter, fast food style so you don't normally have to leave a tip, but of course you could always leave one if you feel it's necessary. 

The girl came by to our table to clean up our plates when we were done eating. Service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately located in Scarbaria, this gem of a steak joint is quite cool. 
Basically it's a 24/7 steak based truck stop but not really a truck stop.
For $11.99 you get a 16oz New Sirloin, rib eye or t-bone with a salad and a starch. 
The cooks know how to cook a steak right, the fries are decent, the mashed, well it's kinda hard to mess up mashed potatoes, and something they call roast potatoes which is potatoes boiled in what seems to be canned tomatoes. 

The are damn good and if you really wanted to you could have a beer.

I used to eat here all the time when I worked nights, cause for the price of McDonalds I get a decent steak dinner.

The owner is often found behind the till, I strange woman who seems to have little patience yet seems polite, she also has terrifying bleached teeth and an 80's powersuit. She really likes telling people \"Sit down and we'll call your number\", she will repeat this like the bus driver from southpark until you in fact sit down and wait for your number to be called.

All in all it's a damn good place to get a meal at fast food prices and speeds with steakhouse flavour.

Be advised though it is in an old Wendy's."}
{"text":"Always a great place for late night meals. The best part about this place is the price. Although it comes with some inconsistencies. 

I've had great steaks here and I've had bad steaks here. Overall, it's been mostly good. Their mash potatoes and gravy are amazing. 

Sometimes the cook under cooks the steak when you ask for medium rare, so that's always a slight disappointment. 

The place can get smoky and loud, depending on how busy it is, but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"Since my last visit, a few months ago, the 16oz steaks have gone up from $14.99 to $17.99. It's still a very good deal, with salad, roll, and choice of potatoes included. I have to knock off a point though for the temperature inside the restaurant. The temperature indicated in my car was 30C and it was cooler than inside. I was sweating through my meal! There were also some tiny (fruit?) flies, mostly around my salad.

I hope they get these issues addressed soon because I'm cheap and I like their steaks! ;)

PS - They also sell the steaks raw if you prefer to cook your own at home. It costs a little bit less."}
{"text":"T-Bones is Toronto east end's answer to Master Steaks on the west end.  Both are steak diners.  Both have a no decor/down to earth venue.  Both have been in business for such a long time that they are qualified as a local institution rightfully.  Both sell steaks cooked to order at unbelievably low prices.  For the same order, the prices are similar; I think the difference is less than $1.  

The differences: T-Bones has a better lighted interior.  It seems cleaner as well.  Master Steaks, on the other hand, has more selections of meat.  T-Bones only offers T-bones steaks, rib eye steak, NY sirloins and hamburger.  Master Steaks also sells, on top of these, pork ribs, Porterhouse steak, Delmonico steak, chicken breast and souvlaki.  Lastly, T-Bones opens 24 hours a day, and Master Steaks opens 19 hours a day.

The steak at T-Bones is not at steakhouse level, but it tastes decent, and it definitely tastes the best for the money you spend.  My medium rare rib eye steak was flavourful (aka I tasted the salt).  It was tender and easy to chew through.  My BF's sirloin steak was flavourful and tender as well.  We ordered garden salad and baked potatoes as sides.  The salad with Thousand Island dressing was fresh.  I don't enjoy the \"boiled\" not baked potato much.

The cashier here was friendly and efficient.

Both T-Bones and Master Steaks offer sensational value.  I love them both for the combined value of price, portion and food.  

Overall, 4 solid stars.  Food only, 3 stars."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place before a few times and really good things too. I'm sure the excitement surrounding this place is purely because of the price. I love my steaks and can be pretty picky but I always keep an open mind with food especially in dingy looking places like these because I like to be surprised. 
The cashier was kind and friendly suggesting the steak special. After looking at the raw steaks in the window I was pretty impressed that they could sell them for as low as $9. They looked half decent.
My steak special came with a Cesar salad, dinner roll, fries (I added gravy) and of course, a 16oz steak. The Cesar salad was a write off after the first bite, it was small and the lettuce tasted like it had been sitting around for a few days. The dinner roll was standard. The fries were pretty good, standard diner fries with gravy on top. The steak, which I had cooked medium rare, was the worst steak I've ever had. Which is not saying much because I've never had a steak that I disliked to the point I couldn't eat. Steaks are steaks what's not to like? It was cooked well so that's a plus but I feel like they could have done so much better with a simple seasoning. It was sort of bland and tasted of the burnt grill. Basically what I expected. 
For the price it was worth it, a good helping of food that was fairly edible and slightly enjoyable but the $18 I spent on the whole meal was enough for me to overlook most of this. I'd come here if I was very hungry, broke, and it was after 10pm. All in all I'm glad it's here and I have an alternative to McDonald's late at night."}
{"text":"Best thing is, this place is open 24 hours and has moderately good choices. All items are not available round the clock through, but you won't be disappointed with the available options.

We had NY Sirloin Steak, medium rare and Chopped Steak. Food quality barely reached average mark considering price vs. quality."}
{"text":"THE spot for late night grub grabs in Scarborough. But just as good any time of day. Killer steak specials, great burgers, great sandwiches, great poutine, good souvlaki (good = tasted great but a little stingy on the serving). I don't think I've ever been disappointed by anything on the menu yet. Definitely go for a steak if you're craving it. 

No frills, no pretense, no BS. Just good food, great prices. 

I happen to think the decor is awesome. It is what it is. Plenty of seating and great for people watching late at night. It looks dingy when you walk in due to the mish-mash of tables and chairs that they apparently pieced together from yard sales but they really do keep it quite clean.

The staff is always great. Cashiers will help you get the best value for your money by recommending specials that you may not have noticed."}
{"text":"Exploring food options in this side of town, we chanced upon this steak and grill resto. My husband and me are \"meatatarians\" so we decided to give it a try.  Honestly, I truly wanted the bbq season to come very soon since coming to T-Bone made me miss my husband's grilling and chilling days more. 
The burgers were dry, not seasoned enough therefore giving them a bland taste, burgers actually tasted like cardboard mush.
To each his own, try this place out if you are adventurous."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre place. The food is not impressive, even though it's price is alright. The lady taking the order was loud and bossy. One of my friend wanted to change the drink from coke to mountain dew, the lady made him drink the half-filled coke before exchanging the drink. Who does that? 
I've been there twice and both of the times the place reeked of the smell of weed. You're better off travelling a little further west to find a better restaurant in the Eglinton area."}
{"text":"Ah this place is the bomb! 

Nice small place located in Scarborough, it can be a bit sketchy... the food though! So the steak here is amazing for the price you get! 16oz steak for $13! with a side of fries/ mash and salad dannnnnnng man what a deal!

The staff is very friendly and quick paced as this place is a 24/7 that's right 24/7! They have a breakfast menu too! Has the same steak options plus eggs, this place is the bomb literally! I usually order the 16oz T-bone and my gf usually gets the NYC steak and hmm always delicious! There are times where the size isn't always the same but hey the price $13 is pretty bomb... or maybe its because i'm chinese and i like cheap food that is filling! 

I remember one time this drunk fella came in and nearly started a fight with this 6'2 dude... So some nights can be a bit sketchy... but it is random so obviously not every night will be like that. Plus if any danger does happen, there is a fire station across the building! The parking lot is quite small so you may have to park in the plaza beside."}
{"text":"T-Bones use to be a good place to eat.  Their quality and prices couldn't be matched. Sadly, that's not the case any longer.   The owners just don't care about quality, they only care about quantity.  The portions are cut in half, and the quality of their steaks are as cheap as legally possible.  They are known for serving food that's been sitting around for long periods of time that should have be thrown out.  For a few dollars more you can go 1 1/2 blocks east and eat at Black Forest Steak House & Tavern"}
{"text":"To be honest, when I heard about the hype of this place, I was kind of suspect due to the fact that people were posting pics of this place at 1 in the morning constantly. So I decided to try it at the mid-afternoon with a friend of mine for the first time. 

The moment I stepped in, you can see how run-down it was and it was hard to breathe especially because it was a hot day in the summer. 

Otherwise for the price I got for a side salad, T bone Steak dinner , with mashed potatoes, and a dinner roll all for $15, it was decent. Don't expect to be wow'd but there's a reason why this place is still in business is because they have nice hard working people, and good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"I came in here on a Saturday night with my friends and the first thing I noticed when I walked in was the heavy smoke. The air instantly dried out my contacts and you're definitely going to smell like the grill after dining inside. The atmosphere of the restaurant was meh and doesn't look too hygienic. Their card machine wasn't working properly and they kept swiping my credit card which was kind of sketch. My friends and I both ordered the $17.99 ribeye special but they got my friend's entire order wrong and served them the NY striploin with completely different sides instead. Each meal comes with 2 scoops of mashed potatoes (which were alright), a really crappy salad with no dressing, and a super hard and dehydrated dinner roll which we didn't even try to eat. We paid extra for mushrooms (sliced and rubbery lol - pretty sure it was canned and then over seasoned to mask the flavours of the preservatives), as well as for gravy and fries. 

In summary, I guess it's worth a try. I wasn't disappointed because I didn't have much expectation and I was full even though I shared half my meal. You are eating what you're paying for so no surprise there! Oh and it's opened 24 hours so I guess that's a plus for the people who aren't worried about dining in a sketched area at 3am.."}
{"text":"Yesterday my hubby and I wanna try a buffet restaurant located at Brimley/Eglinton, but we really don't have the guts to go inside.  Since we are not familiar with the area, so I searched on yelp and found T-Bones and saw the rating is ok, so we agreed to give it a try.

First of all, I don't mind the atmosphere as long as it's not too bad.  It's kind of old family run restaurant.  Once we stepped into the restaurant, we were like surrounded by smoke.  Since the rating not that bad, so we stayed and ordered a 12 oz T-Bone meal and 8 oz Rib Eye steak meal and 2 pops, ended up $42.90.  Price is not bad if the food is good....  If you look at my bill, you will see gravy and fried onion need to charge extra for $0.30-$0.50 each, and both taste quite good, but the steak itself is not good quality.  My hubby ordered medium for his T-Bone and mine medium-well, but turned out both are well done.

If you want steak, I would recommend Beff at Yonge/Steeles.  Actually the price is similar but the steak is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Been going here for at least 4 years now and food quality hasnt changed and still at its best! One suggestion though for the owners: INVEST ON RENOVATING AND TIDYING UP THE APPEARANCE AND DESIGN OF THE RESTAURANT! Tons of people for sure visit your food place 24/7 everyday and you guys have the money to do some renovations. Its not as bright outside when the night comes and it looks sketchy as hell. Anyways, when it comes to food, they offer a lot of selections to choose from. The steaks are mouthwatering and huge in portions! Wait time varies on every visit depending on how busy they are. If you visit Scarborough, you must definitely visit Tbonez and cry later for devouring such well done Steak and potatoes"}
{"text":"I honestly have to say this place is great. What makes it even better is the time availability of 24/7. I mean that is so hard to find in Scarborough. Their food is generally great, but even better after a night out at the club. Their burgers are good with a decent price tag."}
{"text":"This place creeps me out. It's filthy. I was hardly surprised by Tony's review showing the failed safety inspections. You don't need to read an inspection to know this place is filth; take one step in this place and it's kind of obvious.

T-Bones reminds of a Coffee Time inside, except it sells steak. There is a big glass case where the raw meat sits, seemingly at room temperature, in big bins waiting for some poor sucker to buy it. 

I watched in horror as moro mu devoured a steak on a bun type meal from T-Bones. It's definitely a popular place due to the cheap pricing and the late night opening hours. But yuck.

And I eat in some pretty damn sketchy places, so the fact that this place turns me off says a lot for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Ordered a pork souvlaki and it was still raw when I got home to eat it. I won't be going back there for sure."}
{"text":"*3.5-4 stars*

The decor and environment of Coffee Time, but with steak. This is a place where you want to get red meat for cheap. 

They have a burger special with fries at $5.99. The patty is nice and thick, but nothing standout. 

Cheap 16oz steak special at $13.49 (price is upped now) with salad and potatoes/fries and a bun. I would stick with fries, as their potatoes (mashed or roasted) have a weird taste to it. 

Since the meals are so cheap, toppings such as cheese, mushrooms, and onions are charged extra. 

Some of the clinetele may have a creepy vibe to it, as others may mentioned, but that is what I'm not there for. I'm at T-Bones for the steak special.

The servers are nice, friendly, and patient without being patronizing, particularly with the customers who cannot get their order straight. They will also toast your buns if you ask. 

They recently re-did the tiling of the floors and upgraded the chairs and tables, but the decor is so similar to the previous that it is (extremely) difficult to tell. 

Parking is around the restaurant, though be cautious of the potholes around the entrance ways. There is no drive-thru despite the signage.

Gotta get that red meat fix."}
{"text":"so this is a place that has been on my \"must go\" list for a long time and i finally went because a friend urged me to.

came for lunch and ordered the steak special.
16oz sirloin steak, i prefer mine rare but may ask for blue rare next time.
it also comes with a side caesar salad, dinner roll, and from what i heard the option of fries or mashed potatoes. i got the mashed taters and added on some gravy and also bought a bottle of water which ended up costing me a little under $18 after everything? if ur just going to get the the steak special it'll b $13.49 + tax.

there are other options too, steak and eggs breakfast etc etc but i digress.

u'd be surprised how many restaurants can screw up a simple caesar salad. t-bones is not one of these restaurants. thank goodness. dinner roll is a dinner roll, not a big deal. mashed potatoes and gravy were really good. gravy definitely is they key part to that combo. and the steak. my steak was cooked pretty good. maybe not as rare as i would've liked but likei mentioned above, i might get blue rare next time, so u can kinda see that im into sinking my teeth into the flesh and tasting the blood and juices. LOL

meal was delicious, i'll definitely be going back. well worth the money.

I've been told the late night chef is the best. and this place is 24 hours. BONUS!"}
{"text":"T bones!
Another Resturant that I've been visiting for about 10 years. I'm going keep this short and sweet.

Let's start with the good:
Great place for eating ANYTIME of the day as it's 24/7.
The cashier there is very friendly and funny.
Food quality is good and the portion is decent.
T-Bones has always been good with consistency.
Steaks are great. I cannot speak about the burgers because I always get a steak there.

Now, onto the bad.
Not so much bad but here goes:

only had one bad experience with steak there. I ordered a rare steak and I couldn't eat it. I don't know if it's the type of steak but it was gross. So I only eat medium rare there..other places like keg or red lobster I'll take a rare steak. 

Price increase of the steak special from 11.99 to 16 or 17.99! Really??? One special will not fill me up so I don't go there as much as I use to because of the price increase.

T bones is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fries or mashed potato. 

3/5 due to the price increase

Here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo

Thanks 
Kimon"}
{"text":"This could be such a great place, if only they would stop serving #soursteak #sourtomatos blahhhhh

They're open late at night, and the night staff is sweet as can be, plenty of parking, big tables...please fix the food issues . So tired of getting sick every time I eat here."}
{"text":"This is no Ruth's Chris, Barbarians, or swanky steak house for a business expense meal or first date.   This is a place to go with friends after a long day to kick back with a hearty, you know its so bad but yet so good meal.  I am sure on the DDD who, this would be the last D and a very good one.  The food for what they charge is a very good value, well cooked and very filling."}
{"text":"just would like to say that whenever i happen to attend t-bones its always a great experience.service is excellent always and the staff are very courteous"}
{"text":"This once was a place that I went to regularly and had a satisfying delicious meal but.... NO MORE.  We tried them again tonight after not having been in years.  It was terrible.  My friend's burger was burnt and my souvlaki was tasteless.  The Greek salad had no dressing on it and was tasteless too.  So disappointing   The service was super slow so the food was cold by the time we got it.  What happened?  The place isn't the same quality that it once was many years ago.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"BBQ Season is almost here! On this Saturday evening, I have this urges to have some Steak! Yes a piece of meat that is hot and smokey from the BBQ cooked the way I like it...

T-Bones Sizzling Steaks has always been on my mind after reading all these yelp reviews.. $12 for a 16oz steak dinner? Can I really eat a 16oz steak all by myself...

I was eyeing the 8oz when the friendly cashier suggested why don't I jut go for the 16oz, since it is way better value.. That sold me right there.. I would go to 5 hot yoga classes just for this decision!

I ate the whole steak all by myself... it was a tad dry even when I order it medium rare.. but yes it was A-OK.. and for what I am paying? Excellent..   I have definitely pay more for a burger (Marben's $17 burger!) than what I have today...

But please, don't take your sweetheart here for a romantic date, you will be in so much trouble......... 

T-Bones though look sketchy outside..but the inside is clean and the people are friendly, most of the staffs were young females... but it was Saturday 6pm when the sun was still shining!

T-Bones being opens 24 hours, for sure it will be a much better choice than the McDonalds down the street when you have a craving for some real meat in the middle of the night! Maybe I should go out for one of their homemade burgers now after watching the hockey game!"}
{"text":"T-bones Steakhouse probably has its own page in Scarborough culinary lore, but after some recent visits, I think we should tear that page out. This fly-infested, shady looking steakhouse used to serve fresh, juicy steaks for cheap, but now their prices have gone up, and their steaks turned substandard. Even more unforgivable, is that the restaurant is a complete dump.

My family came here late last night for a late dinner. My t-bone steak arrived with literally two flies ON the steak, and another fly on the bun. I thought my steak tasted fine, but it got especially rare towards the bone. Now, my dad ordered the 16oz ribeye steak, and it was terrible. The steak had clearly gone bad, and after one bite my dad was sure. You could tell from the smell. After returning it, we were presented with a new one, ON THE SAME PLATE. The new steak tasted better, but still not great, probably because its sitting in the juices of the first steak. 

I remember when you could get a 16oz T-Bone steak for 11.99. Now, it's 17.99. You can expect flies swarming, tables sticky, and food filthy. Things aren't what they used to be. It's not worth a visit."}
{"text":"So I've decided to return to The Bones a few times since my last review and I must say my experiences have gotten alot better! I think it matter who's working more than anything Lester seems to be the best cook there. I highly recommend the gravy with any order or honestly it's so good u could order it on the side and just drink it haha! 

I've also gotten the steak special a couple of times and not too shabby at all! Comes with two sides of ur choice fried onions and mushrooms are extra but amazing if u like that complement with u food. 

T Bones ur alright in my books"}
{"text":"Decided to order their 16 oz steak special for $14.99 which includes a side choice of mash, fries and something else I forgot with side salad which I feel is a great deal. Steak was tender and juicy as I ordered mine medium rare. The mash and gravy was also good and I enjoyed the whole dinner. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Steak burger and fries for $6+tax at 1 a.m., you can't go wrong! High as hell and it was sooooo good. You'd be an idiot if you didn't go here."}
