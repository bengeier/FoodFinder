{"text":"The place is nice and reasonably priced 200$ for a bottle of Bacardi premium. The crowd was fine, although we started at 10 with bunch of frenz and the place was deserted till like 1am. Not many good chicks were there, few teens that's it.. nothing outstanding..the dancing area is also not very big. The music was good and loud but I guess after ur drunk music anyways sounds loud. Overall I will say an average place."}
{"text":"Que dire du Pinq Taco... Oui, c'est bruyant, oui le service laisse quelques peu à désirer, mais bon... On est sur la rue st-laurent. Resto-bar tendance  offrant tapas et grande sélection de Tequila, on mange bien et les prix sont plus que raisonnable. Difficile à classé, imparfait mais j'ai étrangement apprécié mon expérience."}
{"text":"Friday night the DJ was rocking! We got in there around midnight and it was totally packed. Bartenders were moving fast to get drinks for all of the thirsty partygoers waiting in line. It was beyond packed. If you are looking for a packed nightclub on a Friday night with a bagging ass dj this is the place to be. I'd definitely go again!"}
