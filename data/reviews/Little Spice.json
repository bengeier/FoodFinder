{"text":"Not a fancy seating but very tatsy food...We have tried beef quorma and beriani 5/5 ... the price is very affordable ...will definitely come back again  multiple times ..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is fresh, the spice is perfect, the salt is perfect (not to mention extremely affordable with generous portions). Just moved in near by and am so glad we lucked out with truly great Indian. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Have been twice in two weeks, did take out both times and I have to say it is amazing! I haven`t had Indian Food this good since my long time favorite place started to go downhill a few years back. Good size portions, fresh and delicious, their Naan is great and not greasy. Samosa`s were divine,Vindaloo was amazing, just enough heat. Lamb Qorma was also fantastic, as was the Malek Paneer. Overall wonderful little spot, I would recommend to anyone craving good, decent priced, authentic Indian Food."}
{"text":"Little spice took over Burger Inn a little while ago.  At first glance, it may seem a bit questionable. They kept the old spare bits of cafeteria style tables/chairs from Burger Inn. It's tiny inside and not really a place I'd recommend eating in at.  They more than makes up for it in affordable, delicious food. I've ordered take out from there a couple times and everything has been generous in portion size. Because it's Indian/ Pakistani, I find all their items I've tried are a bit more on the spicy side.  The naan bread can't be beat. One naan could easily be shared between two people, if you have rice as well. Lucky to have a fantastic nee place only minutes away."}
{"text":"Found this place next to chicken on the way, won't regret it. Delicious and amazing value. The Naan was good, the chicken tikka was very flavourful and went perfect with it. The biryani was good, along with the pakoras and samosas. The price was very good, and I've recommended it to a few friends as well."}
{"text":"I was very excited about new East Indian restaurant opened near my work place, so I decided to check this place, and I was not disappointed. They have lot of options in menu... I ordered Chicken Roll.. It took them about 5 mins to make fresh Authentic East Indian CHIKEN TIKKA ROLL, it's was fresh and delicious! Very friendly owner and staff!  Clean dinning area and very cheap food rates. Will go again with work friends for lunch soon."}
{"text":"The food at this little place is fantastic!!  The restaurant itself doesn't hold much in the was of atmosphere, but they sure know how to make incredible food.  They run a busy take out business and usually have our order ready in 20 minutes if we call ahead. Choice of mild, medium, or spicy dishes ensures that it meets my expectations and the fresh nann bread is made to order."}
{"text":"Small space, friendly service, and a stellar food experience. Everything was well prepared and presented. We've been here before and we're back for a reason."}
{"text":"Great place in the SW for Pakistani food!!!  Stumbled here on a random trip to the area and saw this place had opened up. Been looking for q decent place in the SW so decided to check it out with little expectations.  Came away very impressed with their food, service and overall attention to ensure your food is to your taste.   Tikka, afghani kabab are two of the best in town.  Have been back multiple times over the past six months and haven't had a bad meal.   Totally recommend it especially if you live the SW or SE...you can now skip going to the NE/NW!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant for Indian food. A little hole in the wall... The service is friendly and fast. The food is very tasty. Price is great. I always order the lamb biryani. The lamb is tender and tasty. It's the best ever!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing   Butter chicken didn't taste like butter chicken   Samosas were cold   Naan bread was cremated.   Won't be back   Guy spent first 5 minutes on phone rather that greet and seat us    No reason for it not to be better"}
{"text":"I used to not like butter chicken but this is the best butter chicken I've had in my life. It's always fresh and the naan bread is so good!! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Utterly delicious, reasonably priced Indian food with a charming owner and a clean shop. We were travelling through Calgary and wanted something close to our hotel - we were delighted to find this place and will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The intention yesterday was to go to Burger Inn but Little Spice has taken it's place. We hesitantly decided to try it and what a wonderful discovery! :-) We ordered a combo deal. It was ALL delicious and the two of us got a few meals out of it so a great value too! We had to wait 25 minutes for our order because they make it fresh - well worth the wait! We browsed the Chapters nearby while waiting.  I look forward to going again. With such a wonderful variety of options it will be an adventure. The menu describes the dishes well. I wish Little Spice great success, they well deserve it. I reluctantly.. choose the pakoras as a standout. Again, it was all so good!!! :-)"}
{"text":"That lunch special doe.  Between 11am-3pm, $8.99 will get you biryani rice, some chickpea curry, some chicken curry, a veggie samosa, two pakoras, some naan, accompanying sauces, and many w0ws.   The food is excellent - not a single dish or side that was not worth glutting yourself over, with very tender meats and a great homemade yumminess. Also got the chicken afghan tikki, which was also well-seasoned and well-made, but a bit less of a crazy deal ($8 for maybe 9 solid chunks of meat). Sweet lassi also rocked my socks, at a sweet $2.50, and they even ask you to try it so they can adjust sweetness to your liking!  They appear to be a family-run kinda deal. The server (/manager?) was a sweet fellow with beautiful eyes and a nice manner. The interior has a diner sort of look to it, but I was into it since I'm a sucker for slightly dingy but delicious hole-in-the-walls. It's a bit hard to find... just north of Southland Crossing in one of the many strip malls, but so totally worth the quest to find it.   Will definitely go back, probably for that lunch special (and lassi!), next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We tried a few good restaurants of Indian/Pakistani food in the city. I was curious to try this one out with my significant other, because he is a huge fan of this cuisine - as am I. This place is not ambitious, simple decor and one would not expect food of this quality. The Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala were very tasty. The Naan bread is also very good, freshly made. My husband liked the Kebab - for me it was too spicy. We repeated the following day to try the lunch special ( 11 - 3 ) for 8.99. Very good and plentiful. The tray had rice, veggie dish, butter chicken, Naan bread and pakoras ( they were great). The service is OK, the servers came a few times to ask if we needed anything. I like the fact they give customers a carafe with water for free. Got to love that."}
{"text":"Had delivery and it was well within their estimate. The food was excellent. We ordered medium spicy and it was delicious. Had the quorma, butter chicken, tandoori and palak paneer. Will try again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Good Indian. Great takeaway a bit oily for chicken tikka and the lamb rogan josht was a little watery. But the flavors were good not the best ever. But adequate for a Canada road trip. The rice portion was huge and the samosas were good."}
{"text":"The wait time at this place when its busy is ridiculous. We waited about 45 minutes because the restaurant was packed and there was only 1 lady cooking. When the food finally came it was delicious."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you for opening a halal restaurant in the SW! I'm so happy that you guys are doing well here. Also chicken on the way next door is also halal, albiet not very good in quality.  Ok, so the food is consistently good, on par with other desi places. Everything is made fresh so expect to wait 30 mins. Prices are reasonable. Menu is pretty standard. Seriously nothing to complain about. No more driving to DT for desi food, wooohooo! I just wish the place was more appealing so I could sit and eat everything fresh. Also, it would be nice if I didn't smell of garam masala everytime I came here, Lol. But I don't care, as long as there is a desi restaurant in the SW :D  The owners are so professional and nice. Glad to support them.  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I was impressed with the large menu options.Last time I went I had lamb curry with medium spice and it was done perfectly. Just the right amount of spice. Great little place for delicious food at a reasonable price. Will definitely continue to go there to try different menu items."}
{"text":"South Asian food twice in one day....we must be really missing home. :P  After a long day in Banff, came back to our place in Calgary and decided to go here for dinner after catching a breather.  Interestingly, when we called them on the phone, they said that they would be closing soon and so they could only do take-out, then they called back a few minutes later and took that back...they thought it was 9 45 when in fact, it was 8 45...LOL. Looks like a decent family-owned place, comfortable seating, pleasant staff. We got butter chicken - a little on the bland side, chicken karahi - not worth getting (regret not ordering the roghan gosht instead), breads (reasonable) and the chicken biryani - the only reason that I am giving them 3 stars. The biryani is freaking amazing - chicken cooked perfectly, spiced perfectly, the biryani itself is very good."}
{"text":"Recently visited Little Spice for the first time on a Sunday at lunch time. The restaurant is small with seating for about 20 plus a take out counter. Looking for a sit down lunch, a guest and I opted to sit in a try a bunch of dishes to share.   We tried: - chicken curry - lamb vindaloo - ground beef rogan josh - basmati rice - naan  The above provided enough food for two full meals plus two small portions of leftovers.  The three curries were all quite flavourful and the meat was generous. I did find the rogan josh a bit oily. The rice was a bit dry but the buttery naan made up for this shortcoming. When asked what spice level we wanted, we said medium not knowing how hot the dishes would be. Next time, I would say hot because there wasn't much heat to be found.  Service was prompt and we appreciated being provided a pitcher of water. With a total bill of $41 before tip, I found the prices a bit high given the portions, but it's not unusual for the area."}
{"text":"Nice little place to get south Asian food. Decor isn't much, it is mostly a take out place. Not many places in the SW for Indian and this place will save you a drive up north. Good service and will taylor the level of spice to your liking. Very reasonably priced. If I could give another half star I would. 3.5"}
{"text":"I am a regular here and unfortunately I am a creature of habit so order lamb vindaloo a lot!! It is soooo good. I moved to Calgary in September and found The Little Spice by using Yelp. What a find. I have tried other dishes as well and I am so impressed by the variety of flavours, spicy without masking the taste. The staff are great. Yes the decor is basic but I'm looking for top quality food at reasonable prices and they deliver in both ways. Now if I could just get the recipe to the vindaloo. That's not going to happen."}
{"text":"Read about this place on Yelp and figured I would try it out. Food has great prices, but the butter chicken could use a bit more flavor. It almost tasted like chicken in tomato soup. Not exactly kicking up my heels about it. The beef vindaloo was good, lots of bite for medium heat. Rice cooked perfectly and the Naan bread was good as well. I think if they kicked up the spices a bit more in the food, they would have a hit. But I will say this......you cant beat the price. Just prepare to maybe add a bit more spice of your own to some of the dishes."}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw this place pop up in the nearby on Yelp so gave it a try.   Located in a strip mall across from the Chapters, there is ample parking in front of the restaurant. I was confused by the exterior and almost thought it was take out and delivery only, but there are multiple chairs and tables inside if you wish to stay. There were only one table other than us, but the kitchen seemed extremely busy regardless, so I assume most people visit this place for take out and delivery.   We were famished so we got one rice dish, garlic nan, and two curry dishes. We were worried it wouldn't be enough, but curry always seems to fill me more than I expect.   I was sad that they didn't have anything similar to a coconut rice dish here so I opted for the egg rice which was basically a egg scrambled in rice. Surprisingly really good with curry!  I also got the mango lassi and really enjoyed it. It was good but I wish it was served colder.   Our bill was only 35$ (inc. tip) which was not bad at all for the amount of food we got (plus a drink!). Usually for the amount of food we got, at other places we easily pay over 50$.  If you live in the area and they deliver, I would definitely give this place a try. Can't comment on the service for delivery but when we dined in, they were very pleasant.   I took a star off because of my lukewarm lassi and the food did take a while to come out but I hope that's an indication that everything is prepared somewhat fresh."}
{"text":"This place is close from my home so we visit there often. My best pick is the special Lunch Thali where they have Rice, Naan( Soft Flattened Bread), Chicken curry,Mix Vegetable gravy, a samosa and 2 piece of  Pakora all served in a single plate at an amazing price   ~ $10. That  way it is light on pocket but big on flavors and assortment.    I only wish the curries were spicer but as the name of restaurant says there is little spice :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place to get food! We love the owners, the flavour and the options! The best curry in Calgary, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Amazing Lamb Biryani. A little bit on the spicy side even if we requested them to make the spice level medium. Still enjoyable dish especially for someone like me who doesn't enjoy Lamb."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a couple of co-workers and ordered a kabab and a chicken Rogan Josh. If I had known that we were gonna share a butter chicken and chicken masala as well, I probably would've ordered a different meat. The meat was perfectly cooked as the chicken for all 3 dish was tender. Out of the 3, I liked the chicken masala most because it was the most flavorful and had a little bit of sweetness to it.  Butter chicken didn't stand out for me but that's probably because I've had it so many times. Still enjoyable though. The Rogan Josh was pretty good and flavorful although I probably should've asked for spicy 'cause I think they were holding back.  The different spices in the kabab were very noticeable but I like Faisal's kabab more. I felt that it was slightly dry on the outside but the inside was still very tender and very good; whereas at Faisal's, the kabab wasn't dry at all (or at least when I had it).  The naan was fluffy, soft, and a little crispy; just the way I like it. Although I wish the garlic naan was more garlicky like at Spice Hut. Saffron rice was good.  I'll definitely come back to this place 'cause the food was delicious especially for the low price. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Granted I came here alone and it's my first time here so my review will not be as all encompassing as past reviews of restaurants that serve Pakistani and Indian cuisine.  I ordered beef samosas, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.  Note: rice does not come with meal - you have to order it.  The beef samosa was ok. Having made them myself with my ex Pakistani mother in law (who is a great cook), I do expect a certain level of deliciousness.  This level includes and is not limited by:  all around flavour, texture of the meat and peas and the overall cooked finished product.  Like I first mentioned it was ok.  I found it lacked body and the meat was a bit too soft and I missed a subtle sweetness and fresh burst of a green pea.  I think the samosa were a bit overcooked in the fryer.   The chicken tikka masala was spicy, chicken was tender and the flavour overall was robust and good.   The naan was lightly crisp and pillowy soft in the middle and it was lovely.    I will come back again with my S.O and order a few things!"}
{"text":"We have tried Indian/Pakistani food in many cities and countries including India, London and all over the USA. This was our favorite!! What a nice surprise that Yelp led us here and we are happy it did.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala. It was spiced perfectly with a bit of heat on the tongue but the flavor melded together to make a perfect luscious sauce. The chicken itself was very tender. My husband ordered the chicken Vindaloo It was also delicious and entirely different in flavor. We also ordered the naan bread and rice. I loved the rice. It had those beautiful long grains that combine so well with the spicy sauces.  In fact when we finished with the chunks of chicken we still had quite a bit of sauce in the serving dishes so my husband ordered more naan just to be able to eat every bit of the delicious sauces.  The service was excellent and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"This tiny place may not look like much from the outside but the service and food are top notch. I have been hunting for a good restaurant and this will stay on the list for a long long time"}
{"text":"Yum! I've had their chana masala, tarka daal, and chicken tikka masala and they are all VERY flavourful! My favourite is the tarka daal because I love lentils and the curry is very savoury and satisfying. I also like that the chicken in the chicken tikka masala was tender and the curry was very tomato-y and creamy. Although the price is still more expensive than what I'm used to (you have to order rice, naan, etc separately so that's MORE $$ on top of the dishes), they give you a worthy amount of each dish for a very filling and satisfying meal. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Love Little Spice for great Pakistani food. This is a small restaurant with a place to order at Front and then eat there if you wish. There are a few tables. Maybe seven or eight?  We came for lunch and ordered one lunch special and one lamb biryani. To drink, a cold salty lassi.  The food was fresh, tasted delicious and I enjoyed every single bite. The meet was marinated with a delicate blend of Indian or Pakistani spices. Whoever is cooking here knows what he or she is doing.  Better yet, this is not a classy restaurant. You go here for good food. So it's a real treat. Also I like that it is on McLeod Trail just off of Southland Drive.   The staff was also friendly. The food came quickly, came hot and delicious, and the waiter brought us extra chutneys or spices because we asked."}
{"text":"Found this gem in the strip mall on the corner of Macleod Trail and 94th Ave SE after buying some books from the Chapters nearby.  It was around lunch time, so we decided to try the $8.99 lunch special which came with butter chicken, naan, rice, samosa, veggies, and a veggie ball(I totally forgot the name of it, but it was good!). Such a deal for so much food and it all tasted great! I love that their butter chicken was not overly sweet and it had a bit of a kick to it. I am already getting hungry thinking about it.  The dining area is clean and the service is great. Ambiance is okay, as it feels a bit more like a cafeteria setting more than a restaurant. Would definitely come back for to order their lunch special again or maybe try the rest of their menu when we're around that area."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food! Would definitely say this has been my most favourite Indian restaurant I've tried in Calgary. It reminded me of a place my husband and I ate while in London. Fresh foods and great flavours make for a happy palate"}
