{"text":"Wow! Just amazing! The food, decor and the service. The nalli gosht was superb with garlic naan. Loved their Darjeeling Darling cocktail. Everything was just so great and food was hugely satisfying. Wonderful job ! Would recommend to anyone for delicious food and warm ambience!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Had 5 different staff stop by through the course of dinner.  All top notch"}
{"text":"When I travel, I always pick my restaurants based on Yelp reviews.  Another user posted a photo of the butter chicken and lemon drop martini.  It looked delicious.  I ordered the exact same thing.  It was much better than expected!  The service was great too.  So happy to have found this gem."}
{"text":"My friends surprised me with a birthday dinner her and it was such a pleasant surprise! It's a beautiful restaurant, very well appointed. Service was a bit lacking - our drinks took quite a while to be served. But the food is authentic and flavorful, wonderful family-style options to share all around and enjoy. A great addition to the local restaurant scene."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken 65, masala dosa, and mysore masala dosa, which were all delicious! The service was also great. Considering this is the only restaurant in town with dosa, you should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Sauces have a vibrancy that is often missing in other area Indian places.  Lamb in vindaloo was bone-in which meant not a lot of eatable meat per serving, but other than that a welcome addition to the restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I came here two days in a row because dang this place has some great food! Both times, I came during the lunch hour and honestly, the service was on point! Friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the rice puff salad with avocado, garlic naan and the pistachio chicken. D to the lish!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Impressed by what they did with the space and pleased with our gobi aloo and chicken tikka masala. Well-seasoned and delicious. Looking forward to the liquor license!"}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated,with nice environment,friendly customer service,tha lady on the front desk we think she is manager makes our friends birthday ,we really enjoyed food ,dosas is new on whole champaign, i think they need more advertising , i dont know they might wating till everything get handy...i m sure they will do the best ,n they r the best...good luck"}
{"text":"The food was incredible and the restaurant is beautiful! Staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant. Provide delicious food with special spice and unique flavor. Like the environment there, which was private enough."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Amazing transformation of the space from previous restaurant. All dishes were delicious."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Yummy shrimp curry.... wonderfully spicy! Looking forward to going back try some tandoor options."}
{"text":"Was in last night for a birthday dinner, it was really good. I ordered a dish from southern India, it was awesome. The other 4 entrees ordered for the table were really good. It's nice to see this space hopping. Check it out."}
{"text":"The Himalayan Chimney has great interior design with good sitting arrangement. Servers are really nice and friendly, but I wish the food quantity are enough for one person. 16 friends went together and everyone agreed that 
~food quality - good
~quantity - Not enough for one person. You need to order two lunch/dinner for one person. Compare to the quantity, it's really expensive. 

I hope they improve their quantity of food."}
{"text":"The food is good, service is terrible. One order of chicken biryani took 45 min to arrive, actually they forgot about the order for a good 15 min and we had to remind them couple of times before we got it. The manger didn't apologize, and told us to wait rather curtly. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Sloppy service, checks placed on the table when we were halfway through the food, outdoor seating, etc etc. We were fine with being seated at a makeshift table on the sidewalk but then no one came to take our order for a while. So we had to call the restaurant on their phone number and ask them to send someone outside to take our order. Eventually, we asked and were shifted to a table inside the restaurant. However, as far as Indian food goes, in USA, all sins are forgiven as long as the food is good. Nope. This restaurant does not pass. (Not to worry, they don't do any worse than the rest of CU Indian restaurants in terms of food, at the time of writing) The acid test of an Indian restaurant is their goat curry. If the goat curry is bad, it simply means the chef doesn't pay enough attention/time in cooking his food. I understand that cooking Indian food properly is a time-consuming affair but if you are running a restaurant, no mercy."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! The restaurant was beautiful. We went on opening night to check it out and had wonderful service along with great food. The menu was unique with entrees you can not find in Champaign easily. Great atmosphere and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite for Indian food in Champaign.  The downtown location is perfect and the owners have put some love and care into the space.  The dishes are not your typical run-of-the-mill recipes.  The sauce on the Tikka Masala, for instance, has a smokey flavor I love.  The wine selection is nice too.  Who knew wine paired well with Indian food?"}
{"text":"The food is good the ambiance is good best in Champaign, service can be slow. They don't offer separate cheques, which can be a bit inconvenient, but overall good."}
{"text":"Great food, we enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Bhuna Gosht, and the Pistachio Chicken. Really nice restaurant with nice decorations and good location in downtown Champaign.
The reasons why I am only giving it 3 stars? TERRIBLE service. Host and waiter were not nice not accommodating. They even kicked us out at 3:00 because they were done with the lunch shift."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty fancy looking when you walk in. I was a bit surprised. We came here because I looked at their yelp and realized they had masala dosa which my friend loves and no other Indian restaurant in town currently has that on their menu. 

We ordered 2 appetizers. The cheese pakora and samosas. Both were good. I could order the samosas as a meal. 

The main entrees were garlic chicken, butter chicken, and the masala dosa. All of it tasted really good. The chicken pieces were a bit large though, so had to make sure to cut it up a little. The dosa was interesting to try because I'd never had it before. I liked the crispness of it and I will probably order it next time I go. 

The server was very attentive and refilled waters when we were running low. We had even ordered mango lassi and I think they have the best one in town."}
{"text":"Pros 
   -  Good and tasty food.
   -  Nice Ambience.

Cons
   - Very slow service.
   - Expensive for the quantity
   - No lunch Buffet
   
Worst Con
    - Really bad packaging when you place togo/pickup orders. Especially when you are spending so much you at least expect better containers than styrofoam."}
{"text":"I love the creamy curries that Himalayan has, and although it may be expensive (relatively), I personally love coming here whenever I'm looking for lavish Indian meals. I always get the classic butter chicken, naan, and Shahi paneer. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"The good: decent food and bar.  
The Himalayan Chimney serves quite delicious food, well seasoned, and not overly spiced. I prefer the other restaurant, the one in Urbana (different strokes, I guess), but in all fairness, the Chimney stands in the same standard other places in town have already set.  Plus, it's a more refined dining experience (in terms of decor, atmosphere, and fancy plating). Also, if you're searching for alcohol, this place will not disappoint.  Try the Dosa - it's quite unique and fantastic. Also worth mentioning is the affordable prices - certainly one of the best dinners your money can buy.

Needs improvement: slow service !  
The attitude was a little sleepy, sometimes apathetic, and we felt ignored. That could be improved."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I love the masala dosa. The place is clean and classy. I was not a fan of their choice of music though. They were playing Creed or something like that. It was distracting during a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3 stars if it was based on just the food, but I'm rating it 4 because of the service and the decor/ambiance of the restaurant. The moment I walked in, I was very surprised at the beauty of the interior decoration. I felt like I was in a very fancy restaurant. The food was good, but it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. It's definitely a good place to check out if you're craving something spicy and Indian."}
{"text":"My new go-to for delectable Indian food.  My favorites were the curry chicken and the appetizer that had avocado in it.  The naan was outstanding as well.  My only suggestion would be for the wait staff to not to forget to put their customer service smiles on before they clock in."}
{"text":"Pros: Fresh, top notch Indian food and naan that will make you happy all day. And the jasmine rice was so-o-o-o yummy.

Cons: The wait staff seemed shy, or hesitant to approach our table, so everything seemed to take longer (hey--where are you? we're ready to order...hey--come on over--we need more napkins....hey--why are you standing way over there not checking on us? we're ready for our checks)."}
{"text":"I think this is probably the best Indian restaurant in Champaign I have tasted! The food here has a slightly south Indian tinge for all the dishes. If you are a spicy food lover, let the chef know and you'll get mouth watering hot spicy food. Also the prices for the dishes look decent and are not over priced at all."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about all these Indian restaurants popping up in Champaign!   This restaurant is right in downtown Champaign next to Sushi Kame and Art Theater.  

If you go in, during the winter, I would sit as far away from the door as possible... very drafty.   

The menu is extensive.... I've had the dosa and it is wonderful... it's filled with curried potatoes (the name escapes me) but it is so good... the coconut chutney and soup are wonderful accompaniments.   It's a bit much for lunch, and you could feasibly split this between two people.

I also had their awesome, MR. Chicken Tikka Masala.... not sure why they add Mr. to the front of it, but it's memorable....I love chicken tikka masala and adding a mr. in front of it, just made me love it more.

Prices are decent and the crowds that was in the restaurant on a Thursday lunch hour really had me impressed!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. I would say best indian food in the area. 
The starters are amazing, the staff is always nice. No doubt this place is always full with customers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my friend today. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and a Lamb Vindaloo. Not sure what other posters are mentioning regarding saltiness of flavor, the curries we had were great. The naan was buttery and soft, rice was great too. LV was more vinegary than spicy, but good. CTM was flavorful and filled with veggies. Portion sizes were just enough, would recommend a side if you're a big eater though. 

Interior design is top notch, there's ample natural lighting or darker booths if that's what you prefer. 

Service was great, the server persistently refreshed our water and was generally very attentive. 

Would come here again! For its price and flavor, I'd say this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing. We really wanted to get Indian food for lunch so we came here instead of Sitara and we were not disappointed. 

First, the ambiance of the place is gorgeous with really pretty lighting and a cool feel. It's very open and feels modern.

We got the paneer pakora appetizer with this green dipping sauce which was delicious. All the appetizers are reasonably priced falling below $10. 

For the entrees I got the Chicken tikki masala, and my friends with me got the lamb curry and vegetable korma. I tasted them all and they were all so good yet so different. Each dish was also creamy and rich in flavor. 

You choose either naan or rice to go with your entree both options have a good portion. I went with rice while my friends did naan and a cheesy naan all three were delicious. 

We initially were disappointed that we came on a Sunday and the lunch menu was not offered but once we got the food that disappointment had faded. Each entree will set you back about $10-$13 depending on what you get but you have two meals out of that portion. 

Loved this place, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and this is across from the Hyatt.  First, they have done a great job with the renovation on the property!  Next, the food was delicious.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and ate every morsel.  Can't wait to come back with more people, so I can enjoy the ambiance and share more options!"}
{"text":"The food is great. In fact the restaurant has levelled up the quality of an Indian cuisine. Nalli ghost is the best. I wish to have it with a red wine once they have the liquor. Definitely going back again when I visit champaign."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with two friends. We ordered samoas, chicken curry, a lamb dish, and a lentil dish. The meat was juicy and flavorful, and I loved how the dishes were family style so that everyone could share. The lentil dish came out cold, and when we told the waiter, he immediately brought out a new one! Food and atmosphere are great! I don't kmow why other reviews were commenting about the saltiness of the food.
The only downside was the air-conditioning and the organization of the restaurant. The restaurant either didn't have the air-conditioning on or set the temperature really high; I was heavily sweating and felt very uncomfortable while eating.
As for the organization, we were asked the number of people in our party by three different hosts and there was no obvious communication made between the workers. We also had four different waiters who asked if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, and when we were ready to order no one came so we had to flag someone. As a waitress myself, I am used to waiting on people in certain sections of the restaurant and making sure everyone is happy for efficiency.
Conclusion: food and atmosphere are great! AC and organization needs some work done."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, for a change. Newly opened restaurant, spacious, great interior, avoid toilet. On the whole, food was very tasty. For starters, Mixed Tandoori grill was nice, but quantity was on the lower side, for $20. We tried the house recommended, Nalli ghost(Lamb shank) - it was Awesome, a must try, for 2 people. Chicken Tikka masala was perfect. I believe they hv a Bengali cook, who  does an authentic Bengali menu once in a while - will hv to track. Overall, well satiated."}
{"text":"Went here a while ago with my mom and friend. It was quite mediocre, but fine overall.

Our waiter was nice, but didn't check on us during our meal. He also got my naan order wrong, but I'm not sure he's to blame for that since we ordered so many different types.

My mom ordered lamb curry, which she enjoyed, and I don't remember what my friend had, only that it was vegetarian and she liked it. I ordered an eggplant dish called Baigan Patyala; it was mediocre and gave me a stomachache. 

I also know that this place was shut down for a few days in March because it failed a health inspection, and that was after I visited."}
{"text":"Walked in last night to dine and the host stared blankly at me for 30 seconds before he asked me if I had a take out.  Was seated and he was quick on filling my glass of water and handing me the menu.  That's when it all started to go wrong.  Asked what beers they had; liquor license pending.  A sign on the door would have helped.  Browsed the menu and set it aside; usually a clear indication I'm ready to order.  Nothing happened for over 5 minutes in spite of my waving to attract someone's attention.  Some of the waitstaff were standing around doing nothing. Eventually I ordered a Avocado 'Jhaal' Muri for an appetizer and a Mysore Masala Dosa for mains.  The dosa appeared 2 minutes later with no sign of the appetizer.  I sent the dosa back and waited another 5 minutes for the appetizer.  'Jhaal' in Bengali means hot (chilli hot).  This appetizer was neither hot nor very flavorful.  Ate half of it (I was starving) and set the plate aside, suggesting I was done with it  Another 10 minutes passed till I grabbed a guy clearing an adjacent table and told him to cancel my dosa order and grab the check.  Not once had a member of the waitstaff stopped by to check on my table, after the appetizer was served.  A couple of minutes later the owner / manager showed up with the dosa and 5 other folks in tow.  I explained my displeasure at the poor and what clearly appeared to be racially biased service.  There was no shortage of waitstaff and the attention paid to non-Indians was staggering.  To their credit, the apologies were fast and furious and they did offer to comp the appetizer, which I politely declined.  They have promised changes and only time will tell.  I will visit again as they are the only joint in town serving dosas and hopefully they will have their act together.  It will certainly help if the waitstaff brushes up on their English skills too"}
{"text":"Me and friends were craving dosas so came here specifically for that. The masala dosas were really really good. The chutneys and sambhar were okay. Liked the tomato chutney but didn't like the coconut and cilantro chutney. One of my friends got the Mysore masala dosa which was very spicy so just a heads up. The reg masala dosa was just perfect if you can't handle too much spice. The pain Puri was alright. The ras malai was delicious!!! Def. recommend that! I would definitely come back here to try the biriyani."}
{"text":"Very good food.  

My main complaint is the staff.  Over-agressive table clearing (Midwest eat and run culture meets Indian get their money and push them out culture). Surly waiters.  Creepy restrooms and generally cheap decor."}
{"text":"ON SERVICE: A 50-min wait to have someone take the order (food) for a party of twelve (in an almost-empty restaurant) at 6pm on a Wednesday. Worse, someone had to go call the server. And a 30-min wait post-dinner because of mistakes with the checks. Also, they should be prompt with drink refills and update their menus for missing ingredients.

ON FOOD: Good taste, among the best in town. Which isn't saying that much to begin with. Bhuna Ghosht (curry) is well-spiced, with fairly tender chunks of meat. Subz Chicken (curry) is all spice with tender chicken and juicy vegetables. Chicken Korma (curry) is mild and creamy, but got cold within 10 minutes so it's clearly been reheated. But the Lamb Seekh Kebab takes the cake- cold on arrival, reheated, with three leaves comprising the \"accompanying salad\" and 6 small pieces of kebab for $14.99 

TERRIBLE value for quantity, and that's where you lost me. I only see myself returning to pre-order their breads for takeout- these were appropriately priced and well made with respect to both seasoning and texture."}
{"text":"Really good curry chicken. I enjoyed my meal , tasted pretty authentic being that my family is from the Caribbean and eats curry all the time. My boyfriend enjoys their butter chicken. Everything tastes good with white rice and the naan bread!"}
{"text":"Today is my first time here.food are amazing!i loved how they make the test..highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place was renovated after the previous Thai restaurant closed, and it looks really classy and cozy now. The corner location at Church and Randolph is convenient for downtown. 

My husband and I went on a Friday night at prime dinner rush and while we had to wait a few minutes, it was not a long wait. Service was attentive and efficient throughout. We tried the paani puri as an appetizer. We weren't expecting it to be cold but it was very tasty, nonetheless.

I got the mild butter chicken dish with rice and my husband got the goat curry with medium heat served with naan. Both were excellent and devoured. Everything was extremely flavorful. As a side, we also got the cucumber yogurt sauce (forgetting the name now) which was refreshing and cooling, if you ordered a spicy dish. 

Will definitely be back! New favorite!"}
{"text":"The dishes were delicious. The reason why I only give two stars is there efficiency and the capability to serve a group with more then 6 people. We had 8 people today and waited about 1.5 hours for our table..."}
{"text":"Aaaammmaaazing!  Come you won't regret it. 

Portions are more than enough. We had chicken tandoori and lamb vandaloo with rice and garlic naan for lunch and had enough for a second portion for dinner.

Amazing flavors...mango lazzi's are delicious.  

Boy did they renovate and redecorate...it looks classy inside.   

Love it will come back."}
{"text":"I had the Avocado Jhalmuri and Saag Paneer and both were excellent!  The renovation of the space is very impressive!  Very classy and elegant.  I got my order to go, and they gave me a mango lassi while I waited, on the house!

I ate my food right away so no pictures were taken, but everything was just so amazing!  The portions are generous and the naan was very good also!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my friends on Saturday. The food was good, tasty and presentation was beautiful! I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Finally, an Indian restaurant with a South Indian menu in Champaign. The garlic naan and malai kofta combination was pretty good, but it was their dosa which stole the show. I ordered the Mysore masala dosa which is a slightly spicier version of the regular masala dosa, and it was perfect! The texture and the filling was great, and the sambhar and chutneys were nicely flavored. They will even give you free sambhar refills which is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was simply amazing! The service was professional, polite and quick. Despite the fact that the attire was casual, the setting was well done and could easily accommodate for a more formal evening. Very refreshing take on Indian dining! A definite must do for all visiting Urbanna Champaign."}
{"text":"Great food! They offer both spicy and mild/very mild food. If you are looking to introduce someone to Indian food, this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I personally liked Himalayan Chimney. The interior is aesthetically pleasing and it's a decent spot for a dinner night out if you're into Indian food. Lots of variety with different spices. I simply did not like it as much as Kohinoor with regards to the food value:quality ratio and the service. Still had an overall positive experience, so I would go back."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! We have come about once a month since it opened and couldn't be happier. The staff is professional and kind, the atmosphere is cozy but chic, and of course, the food is excellent. The Masala Dosa is a must, along with the saag paneer and pistachio chicken, and the samosa chaat if you're really hungry. Our servers have always been timely and kind - they go above and beyond. It definitely our go-to for date night, groups, and just a time we need some warm comfort food. Just go!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night. Food quality was very good and I would rank it on par with Sitara, another excellent Indian restaurant in town. We had vegetarian momos (like a dumpling) to start, followed by several entrees which we split as a group. The Malai Kofta was good, and most of the standards (tikka masala, various biryanis) were good as well. The entrees are very sharable if you come in a group. We ordered an extra portion of the naan...the pesto and garlic varieties were a nice touch. Prices are around $11 per entree and, with a $2 additional side, this is a pretty filling meal. 

As for potential negatives: serving sizes vary a little bit, ranging from a lot of biryani to a little bit of Malai Kofta. However, a lot of the fun is getting the gravy/sauce/broth on some naan or rice, so the \"smaller\" entrees didn't disappoint in that area. The restaurant was slammed and it looked like they were understaffed in the front of house and a little overwhelmed in the back of the house. Overall, we spent about 1:45 at the restaurant, which is a little longer than I usually shoot for. All of the food came out great so the back of the house seems okay, but bussing was pretty slow at our table and we weren't given a full drink menu outside of a small card with wine.

Overall, with a few kinks worked out, this place is going to be a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Really great Indian food...definitely the best in Champaign. Everything is very well made with attention to detail. The ambience is really nice; owners did a fantastic job renovating it from the dumpy thai restaurant it used to be. It's a little on the pricey side and portions could come with more meat, so I would give it a 4.5 rather than 5. However we keep coming back :). We normally get goat madras (dark sauce, spicy, tender meat with bone on) and Shahi paneer (so good). But anything on the menu is delicious. Of course, the garlic naan is a must have with your meal."}
{"text":"Fairly new Indian restaurant in town. Decided to go today for dinner as it was their Bengali cuisine special. As a Bengali, this was a huge event as there are no restaurants in town where Bengali cuisine is served! We arrived fairly early and was seated without any wait. The restaurant is pretty big with lot of seating arrangements. The interior decor was pleasing and aesthetic. Although there were lot of people in the restaurant, we never felt it was noisy or too crowded! The wine list was short but looked very pricey. Since we were dining authentic Bengali food, we didn't end up having wine. As a starter, we tried the samosa chaat of their main menu along with mango lassi. The samosa chaat very tasty with right amount of spices. The mango lassi was yummy and very thick. For our entrees, we tried their Bengali menu which had some fantastic options. We had luchi ghugni, jhinga aloo posto, kosha mangsho (goat kosha) and shrimp malai curry along with tomato aamsotto chutney. The luchi was bigger than its usual size but was good. Our favorite was the goat mangsho. The meat was really well cooked and tender with the right amount of spices. It was very flavorful. The jhinga aloo Posto was also very nice. Shrimp malai curry was least appreciated. The overall pleasure of dining Bengali food in Champaign was so fulfilling and amazing. The service was fast and attentive. Our server was also very friendly. I hope they continue serving Bengali cuisines sometime during the month and I would definitely love to return."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable experience. Able to converse easily w/o noise. Excellent food. Reasonable prices for entrees. Alcohol prices were somewhat high. Distinctly different kinds of food compared to Sitara in Urbana, a favorite of ours. Plan to return often. Service was excellent. Ample space. Seated immediately."}
{"text":"When I went on a weekend evening, the wait time was about 5-10 minutes even though there were only a couple of guests. I was seated at the bar and I ordered the lasooni gobi (cauliflower appetizer) and chicken vindaloo. Both were tasty. The waiters seemed to take a while when asking for my order or getting the check. Overall, great food but the service can be improved."}
{"text":"It was both hit and miss. Some dishes were amazing, others were a little underwhelming. The dal Himalayan is AMAZING. I would go back just to have that again. The avocado jahlmuri was awesome as well. Our chicken entrees were good, but not amazing. The butter chicken was great; the korma was okay. Naan was okay as well. All in all, it's a good Indian joint. If you've never had Indian food, it's a good place to go but if you have a basis for comparison, you might be a little underwhelmed by some dishes but also extremely surprised by others. Like I said, hit and miss."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in awhile... not just in Champaign but anywhere (and I travel a lot). Atmosphere and service was great too!"}
{"text":"Omg...been here almost a year from california and haven't found anything good. Finally this comes to town. It is so yummy. Would definitely recommend! The Himalayan special is so good and so is the chicken saag."}
{"text":"The setting is dark with dim lights and candles on each table. Feels like an authentic Indian joint. The butter chicken was nice and creamy with a side taste of ajwain (caraway). Also tried the chicken chettinad and it didn't disappoint. 

Probably one of the better indian places on campus if not the best. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent. We had goat madras and the second starter on the menu which is crispy rice and dots of mustard for the sauce and maybe cardamon in it and wonderful. The Maharaja beer was great. Service excellent, friendly. It was pretty warm, so I'm hoping the ac is working better next time I go, which will be soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here sense they opened, and I think the food is very good. Their dishes are unique, yet authentic and they are priced well too."}
{"text":"I've tried and very much liked the chicken tandoori, lamb biryani, dal Himalayan, sag paneer, malai kofta, and baygan patyala. So far my favorites are dal Himalayan and chicken tandoori. I suspect a lot of cream is put in dishes/stews like sag paneer and malai kofta which makes them extremely delicious but very heavy and perhaps not super healthy."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here! Their butter chicken and Bhuna ghost were great. The starters were pretty good except the pani puri was missing the sweet chutney. The portions were a little small for the price of the food. Overall great experience though."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and have seen pictures of my friends visiting here after leaving Chambana, so when I visited over the weekend I came here with a big group of friends. The atmosphere of Himalayan Chimney is nice, and they had no problem seating a group of 7 of us at 6:30 pm (dinner time) so it was a nice painless experience. 

I got the butter chicken, plain, garlic and stuffed naan and had a piece of my friend's chicken tandoori. Overall the food here was pretty good, albeit a little salty for my tastes. But at first blush it is good, with solid seasoning and the naan is nice and soft, the tandoori chicken very tender and easy to cut through. 

As I progressively kept eating there was a lot of oil at the end of the naan basket and the curries got saltier and saltier. Nothing too painful, but just a slight gripe. But the service is quick and timely and food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Decent place and has Indian alcohol. Kingfisher and all. Some dishes like the cashew chicken are good, others are ok. Not bad for Champaign, lol"}
{"text":"The lassoni gobi was delicious! Also had the samosa chaat, chicken tikka masala, and the lamb kebab. Everything was flavourful and the service was great. I went during a really busy night but the waiter was still attentive."}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled w/ the food. Loved the shrimp korma at Sitara but here wasn't good, even though the owner is the same. Recently got cited/closed temporarily for health code violations. Not going back..."}
{"text":"This our second Saturday luncheon exploring foods and flavors new to us at this new gem of a restaurant. We are impressed with what has been done regarding the remodel but also everything else from the service, to the menu, the beautiful plating and excellent flavors not to mention the welcoming and friendly staff! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian in town! I've eaten Indian food all over the country and world and was always a little disappointed with the options here in CU before this spot opened. All the other restaurants here overcompensate with too much cream or butter and the dishes are heavy without being more flavorful, even making me feel a little sick. At The Himalayan Chimney they don't so this and I leave feeling satisfied and nourished and like I had a healthy Indian meal. They also have a lot of unique dishes that other places in town don't have. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the restaurant during my first visit. I loved my vegetarian dish and thought they did a nice job with the renovations. The samosas were good and the naan, a little crispier than I like, but still good. I went for lunch today and it was not nearly as good. They were out of samosas but didn't inform us until it was pretty much time to get our entrees. My sister didn't get her mango lassi until well after we got our entrees (and we waited a long time for those) and only after we reminded the waiter. The waiter didn't apologize or anything for forgetting all about it. I got vegetable biryani and it was both very spicy and very salty. Not nearly as good as what I've had elsewhere. The raita was much thicker than what I've had and not refreshing. The waiter mumbled and seemed like he hated his job and was inattentive about everything. I asked for a to go container for my leftovers and even the container he brought was too small. The other people working there were more pleasant. The prices are expensive for lunch especially considering the long wait for food and poor service. I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"We got take out here the other night. The parts of the restaurant we saw were beautiful and everyone was very nice. We got 2 entrees, an appetizer and a side and spent $40. The entrees were DELICIOUS. We got lamb saag and chicken tikka Marsala. The stuffed naan was amazing, my only gripe was with the portion sizes. We spent $13-$14 on each entree and they came in a small soup sized container. Not much food at all. Everything we ate was really yummy though."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the staff friendly. I'm sure the food is great too, if you can handle spice. Unfortunately everything there seems to be covered in heat and I just can't eat it. Be warned if you are a wimp like me!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the decor and interior aesthetic is as good as it can get. The food is great, although I wasn't a fan of the overwhelming taste of cauliflower I had in one dish -- but I guess that's my fault for getting something with it, when I don't like cauliflower. The only really thing to improve is wait time. We waited for over an hour. Though I didn't mind, I see how others would. But other than that great fresh food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"First things first. The food here was ridiculous. I couldn't tell you what the best thing on the menu was because it was all so delicious. The biryani was fire, both spicy and amazing. The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala were on 10 and the sauce was exquisite especially when eaten with naan. We got cheese, garlic and the special naan, and my favorite was the special naan then garlic then cheese, but they were all great. And the samosas were fried to perfection.

So why two stars? The service was garbage. Absolute trash. It might have been since we were a party of 8 and gratuity is already included, but our table was severely neglected. We saw pretty much all the waiters having drinks at the bar as we were hovering over our EMPTY drink glasses. We waited 20 minutes for our check. And the waiter literally ignored me completely on two different occasions. 

If I ever eat from here again, which I probably will, it will only ever be takeout."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here but it would be nice to browse the menu it usually makes me hungry to go check it out..

Just saying...luv indian food.."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Service was impeccable. The only thing that wasn't great was my wine and for me, that's hard to pick out. I had the Tenschen Rome, A blend of whites.  I do not recommend it. Tasted like a cheaper wine such as Barefoot etc. After appetizers of these spicy,  unbreaded chicken chunks which I have forgotten the name of, we had Butter chicken and Saag Paneer. They really could not have been better. Also enjoyed the salad with honey mustard-type yogurt dressing. Wonderful!
Thank you to the staff. Ambience is delightful. We will definitely be back. I can't wait."}
{"text":"Since we are doing the \"We haven't eaten here on Wednesday\" thing, Kridz doesn't really have an adventurous palate. So, when I said, lets do an Indian restaurant, she said NO! So, I've got a co-worker from India, and I asked if he'd go with us and order us things that aren't spicy \"I don't even like pepper\". I was like, we need to try an Indian place soon, because we don't want to get to December and only have that as the option. 
So, my guy Rak and his GF went with us. 
I have no idea what we ate. 
Kridz got a Kingfisher Premium Lager to drink. I went with bourbon (not Indian bourbon). 
Rak order the food, we had 2 appetizers, and 2 dishes to share (all chicken). Kridz really liked the second app, the first was like chicken wings, and the second was some extremely tender part of a chicken.
Kridz and I both got Naan for  our courses, while Rak and the GF got a different kind of thinner bread (and some rice). I got the cheese Naan, Kridz went with the garlic. 
I initially started to eat by putting the food directly on the naan and eating it like a sammich, to which Rak was like no, rip it apart and pinch up a piece of meat, and wipe up some of the curry. So, I'm like... ok. 
Everything was awesome. Our server was great. The company was great. Kridz really enjoyed the food (but we need to ask Rak what it was we had, so we can try it at other places). 
Kridz garlic naan was really garlicy. So, as we were leaving Rak told us to try a spoonful of the stuff by the entrance. It's some sort of licorice-y thing (or so it seemed), which immediately cut the garlic, and was quite pleasant. 
So, we really enjoyed our visit, and can have another place to go to on those nights when we are like \"what do you want???\" \"I don't know\"... (every restaurant downtown....) \"Nah\".... Himalayan Chimney? OK."}
{"text":"I had been longing to see a fine Indian restaurant in Champaign and finally my prayers got answered. Yes, there are others so called Indian restaurants in Champaign but trust me not one serves Indian food. Because of my experiences with these restaurants, I was little skeptical to try out Himalayan Chimney but still I took the leap of faith and went here for dinner. We were  greeted and seated immediately. The decor is so romantic, loved it. We ordered tandoori triple play, Malai kofta, garlic naan, onion kulcha, samosa and a cocktail (lemon shot martini). Everything tasted great. This is the first time I loved malai kofta in US. It reminded me of what we used to get in Delhi :)(nostalgic). The pastry of samosa was tad oily but it still tasted great. My husband loved his drink and ordered one more. All in all, a wonderful experience. 
After this, I have ordered many times for pick up too. I tried their Bengali menu which was a bomb. I tried channar dalna and goat kosha. 
I'm drooling as I'm writing this review. So, let me finish here and place a pick up order :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Champaign hands down. Prices are a little steep but it is definitely worth the food and the ambiance."}
{"text":"We loved the food here. The service was very good. The Dosa is totally authentic! Thin and crispy and full of curry potatoes. We came back a second time in one week just for more Dosa! The Himalayan lamb curry was really good as well. We'll definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks but service is poor. Waiters just won't come to take your order or forget to pick up your card. Try the dosas. They're awesome."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with several friends. It took three asks and a long time just to get my drink. The air conditioning was not working, so it was very warm. I understand that people were working on the problem, but there was no sign of trying to compensate for it. Disappointed that water was served without ice, which would have helped a lot while waiting to give the food order and for the food to arrive, which felt way too long. There was a mix up of  food for two people. Despite all these happenings and confusions, the group tip was already included in the bill ....In addition, the path to the restroom and the restroom itself was very disappointing. Untidy floor and broken doors does not fit with the atmosphere of the restaurant at all.  Not how I imagined eating out with friends on a Friday evening would turn out...."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how good this place was. My sister dragged me here on a very hot day when I wanted to sit at home. The wait time of 20 mins didn't impress me any further.

Once my chicken 65 and samosa chat arrived, I swayed a bit. The nail in the coffin was the paneer though, creamy, sumptuous and perhaps the best I've had anywhere. We were quite full but had to try the dal makhani, so 20 mins later it sat on our table, and it was as good as we expected.

Loved their cocktails as well, with an indian spin. The mojito was awesome."}
{"text":"People who've read my review contested that the food isn't as salty as the one time I had it, so I gave this place another try. Service has improved, though I went at a time when it wasn't busy at all. While I no longer needed to gulp down an entire fish tank, I still needed several glasses of water to go with my samosas and curry. Their spiciness level is not for the faint of heart and stomach. The mango lassi now has an overwhelming amount of rose water. Would I go back again? Probably not, but I'm giving an additional star for their attempt at elevating Indian cuisine."}
