{"text":"A perfect place to taste wonderfully cooked Korean food. One of my favorites in town. Worth a try if you are an Asian food gourmet."}
{"text":"I usually order a bulgogi plate the first time I visit a Korean restaurant, which serves as a basis for comparison. The bulgogi here is bad. Mine came out watery. Bulgogi is supposed to be grilled meat, it should never be watery! It's served on top of a layer of onions, but no round cabbage. Worst bulgogi I've had in C-U. Spoon House does it better, as do Arirang and Woori Jib. There's another place called Yori Q in West Lafayette (unrelated, as far as I can tell) that is also much better."}
{"text":"Giving Yori Q a 4/5 rating with a caveat to be explained later.  Suffice it to say with one exception, the food was excellent and I'll definitely be returning often to eat here.  Review is based upon taste, service, and value metrics.  First taste.  We ordered a boodae jungol, corn pahjun, egg jjim, and some spicy dahk bbq stuff.    I'm going to go ahead and mention the \"exception\" mentioned earlier.  Anything on their menu which is a hot plate or whatever, with spicy bulgogi, pork or chicken... I would stay away from all of those items.  Our dahk bbq hot dish thing was an abomination.  The chicken was not cleaned, so we were eating huge pieces of fat, unrendered skin.  And on top of that, they cooked the chicken, but they did not get rid of the grisly cooked chicken blood.  It should be a standard practice to clean the chicken, and once its cooked to skim off any grisly cooked blood so that the customer isn't eating that.  But every mouthful of it is either fat and skin, paired with a goopy, and grisly cooked chicken blood consistency.  It was basically inedible.  I'll go ahead and throw in the value aspect of these dishes as well.  At the 14 dollar price point, everything in that section of the menu is the biggest rip off.  Portion size did not at all justify the price point, paired with the horrible blandness, fat, unrendered skin, and grisly chicken blood... if I could give a 0/5 on the basis of this dish alone I would.  But the fact of the matter is, everything in that submenu of hot dishes is a complete rip off, and until they double the portion sizes of all of those dishes, and remedy their preparation issues, I would stay far away from all of those items.  NOW, with that horrible exception out of the way... the good news is, the corn pahjun, egg jjim, and all of the ban chan they gave us was absolutely perfect and excellent.  The Corn pahjun, where it looked WAY overdressed and oversauced, it was actually quite balanced.  A little more acid in the sauce would have been nice, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The egg jjim was more or less a test of execution of a classic ban chan, which they did well.  It was delicious and well prepared.  The boodae jungol was also quite excellent.  I think my defacto standard for boodae jungol is at san soo gab san in Chicago.  And on the basis of taste, Yori Q's interpretation of it was right on par.  It was just enough spicy.  They did put a bunch of \"cheap meat\" in it like spam, and hotdogs, and didn't put any premium meat in it, like chadulbaegee, and put VERY LITTLE samgyepsahl, so it didn't really meet expectations as far as ingredients both in protein and veggies, but it at least tasted good.    So aside from the exception that is that dahk bbq, (which should get a -50 out of 5), I will give the rest of the meal a 5/5.  Very delicious.  Service.  Service was great.  A guy named Andrew was our server.  He was excellent, warranting a giant tip.  If you go to Yori Q, request that Andrew be your server, he was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  He will no doubt make your dining experience improve on his demeanor, and excellence as a server alone.  In general the food was ordered, and came out in a short time.  Our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and ban chan, and being receptive to our comments on the food.  5/5 easily on service.  Some things they could have done better with our boodae jungol is to cut the ramen noodles, and provided a better array of veggies, and premium meats in it.  The extremely long ramen noodles made it impossible to serve out the boodae into smaller cups without lifting your arm 5 feet above the wok, all the while hot boodae juice is falling and splashing all over your clothes.    Value.  So again, with the hot dishes as an exception, meaning the dahk bbq we got, and every other item in that submenu, I easily give Yori Q a 5/5 on value.  Though I will say, if they do not correct the portion sizes and preparation problems with those dishes the next time we go, their overall rating will drop on this review to a 2/5.  But the boodae jungol was reasonably priced since it was delicious, and the appetizers were not terribly overpriced.  Even with the horrible dahk bbq, our ticket was $52 before tip, which, if you remove the dahk bbq from the equation, it was very reasonable.  So again, aside from the hot dishes, bbq dishes sub menu, Yori Q gets a 5/5 on value.    All in all a 4/5 experience I think.  They will get repeat business from us.  And we'll see if they lower the prices on the hot dishes, double the portion sizes, and correct the preparation issues.  Hopefully I won't be coming back to this review and stamping a 2/5 stars on it.  All things considered, Yori Q is a good place to go, just be sure you ask people what to get before you go, lest you end up with a mouth full of creamy cooked chicken blood, unrendered chicken skin, and chicken fat to eat with your rice."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant. We ordered bulgogi jeongol, it was extrordinarily sweet. Not recommending it if you are trying to maintain healthy lifestyle, having diabetes or stomach hyperacidity. We could hardly finish it due to stomach discomfort."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 4 times only because it was delicious at first - I liked their donkatsu and kimchi stew. Delicious combination!   The last time I went, the donkatsu sauce changed completely and does not taste anything like any donkatsu sauce that I've tasted. Disappointed and won't be coming here for donkatsu.   On the bright side, their corn jeon is delicious. Also, their seulong tang is delicious.   My cousin got the ramen last time and I think they put cheese in the ramen. He said it was okay - probably not recommended.    I would recommend this place for certain dishes and hopefully the recipe does not change."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in town that has vegetarian and vegan friendly options! The teriyaki tofu ricebowl is to die for"}
{"text":"Terrific service with warm and friendly staff. The menu is limited, but very interesting. We had several starters, all excellent, preceded by lovely side dishes, which the staff offered to keep refilling. The only mild disappointment was the old reliable bi bim bap, which was bland. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Checked out Yori Q for late lunch/dinner and ordered the bibimbap.   The good:  For $10, there was plenty of food considering I got multiple banchan side dishes and a soup. Everything tasted great and, most importantly, the service was amazing. I was there for maybe 45 minutes and I was asked if I needed anything at least 6 times.  The bad: While everything was great, the bibimbap left more to desire in regards to the bulgogi. It was one of those instances where I felt like I took 3 bites of meat and the rest was rice and veggies. But it was only $10, so can't complain too much.   Overall, Yori Q is a great Korean food option in the area and I'll definitely be back eventually."}
{"text":"Just had a terrific bento box lunch with a friend. He enjoyed the kimchi soup and chicken bulgogi, I had tofu soup and pork bulgogi. We shared a corn cake too, which was excellent! Service was great and prices reasonable. My only change would be to offer a larger range of spiciness, it was kind of mild for us. Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The crab pot is really nice."}
{"text":"Delish seasoned kalbi and bulgogi, portions were on the larger side, server was very friendly and attentive. She asked multiple times if we wanted more side dishes after I devoured all of ours. Water is out on the table so you can refill as much as you want without a wait. A small kimchi soup can be added on (which I loved) to any dish. The inside is just plain, nothing memorable, but the well seasoned food and friendly service is what makes this place stand out."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying that I know absolutely nothing about Korean food. I came here because my husband and I wanted to try out a new restaurant and, based on the menu and pictures, this place seemed cool. We loved it! We particularly enjoyed the oduk kochi and the chap cake with green tea ice cream. I recommend sansachun to drink (it's a berry rice wine, sweeter than grape wine). We'll definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, a week after they opened.  I was seated right away and the waiter was super friendly!  He suggested going for a bento box over their \"fusion\" fare because they hadn't perfected it yet....but assured me that the authentic korean fare was spot on.   I ordered the bulgogi bento box and boy was he right!  It was excellent!   I inhaled everything in a matter of minutes.... Not sure what everything was (bulgogi, tempura, rice, a macaroni type of salad and then these gelatinous type of things) but it was great!   I also ordered the kimchi soup and that was great too but it took me a while to finish because it was almost too spicy for me.  Everything came out to $11.  A welcome addition to Champaign!  Thank goodness they replaced Kamakura...that place definitely needed to go!"}
{"text":"Let's set the expectation: Does Yori Q claim to be redefining the Korean food scene and pioneering new methods and flavors? Nah. Do they charge you an arm and a leg for everything on the menu, and make pretty, precious food? Nope. But are they a stuffy old Ma-and-Pop shop? Nope, not that either.  Here's my take on what's going on. They're young and they're excited. They're showing respect to the old school, but still bringing things out a la bento and they're eager to please. I had tremendously attentive service, a nice convo with the manager, and it was a pretty affordable affair. Not sure what there is to dislike there?  We came in and sat down (full waiter situation) and wanted a late lunch. I got a little beef bulgogi, and chose the tofu soup to go with it (you get a few choices). The soup was mellow and silky, not quite a soodubu jigae, because it was sans cabbage, but more like a sipping broth with copious amounts of soft tofu.  The bulgogi was good, and for the price, I thought the portion was fair. Of course it came with a few traditional sides -- kimchi, cabbage salad, shredded potato -- and it was a nice all around dish. I saw the bibimbap as well, and it looked to be plenty hearty and probably worth the few extra bucks.  The service was kind and our server was very willing to please. Water was filled frequently, and they brought the food out quickly. Everything was quick, and we were treated to a simple meal at a reasonable price. Nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"I went every Korean/Asian restaurant near U of I and Yori Q have the best bulgogi on campus. Service is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly and knowledgeable service, fair prices. I don't get to Champaign often, but I wouldn't hesitate to come back to Yori Q.   This was the first time I tried Korean food. Lucy was our server and she was awesome. Very helpful in making suggestions for lunch and she patiently explained what everything was to four old guys. The food came out quickly and everything was piping (do people still say that?) hot. The soup, served in a stone bowl, was still boiling.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything here is. SO. GOOD. Came here for lunch on a Saturday with 5 other people - we got the corn jeon, 2 sides of kimchi fries, the bulgogi hot plate, and the budae chigae hot plate to share and it was plenty of food for all of us. I'm not Korean, but I love Korean food and this food tastes authentic to me. All 5 of the people I came with are Korean and they love this place, so that should tell you something!"}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ is really good. The servers are polite and kind. You can have all you can eat here."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place! Great service, great food. I'd recommend their hot pod and corn pancake. This place just opens and I've already visited three times."}
{"text":"The atmosphere threw mixed messages on all levels: style, mood, and formality. There was no sense of brand or cohesion. The dining area felt unfinished as if the designer had started on a concept but quit in the middle of the process and the rooms were left incomplete and the decor was put together by a well-meaning but untalented amateur let loose at TJ Maxx. The restaurant didn't feel mindfully, purposefully minimal but rather lacking and empty. It's a shame because I can see artifacts of what seemed like a really cool concept coming through in things like the logo and light fixtures.   The women's bathroom seemed to be forgotten in the effort to do something about the dining area. It was dark, dingy, dirty, and even more confusingly decorated, loosely speaking, than the rest of Yori Q.  Nevertheless, the menu had a solid selection of casual, fast/pub-style fusion dishes, and the food was good, and that's the most important part. Yori Q is somewhat Americanized so don't come with the wrong mindset and expect to find anything like soondae or lotus root side dishes. I thought the menu was appealing to a Midwestern college area.   When we arrived, we had the choice to sit at a table with or without a grill. We sat at one without. We ordered the corn jeon, galbi, and kimchi jjigae. The food was yummy. Nothing truly phenomenal in taste or presentation. However, the corn jeon stood out among the dishes we ordered. It was a sinfully good combination of chewy, fried dough, corn, spicy mayo, and sweet sauce. I've never encountered this dish in Korean cuisine and it was a pleasant, new experience. The price for everything was appropriate and the meal was more than enough for two hungry people.   Service was really great, too, though we went when it was nearly empty, so I can't speak for peak times.   I would probably come back just to eat the corn jeon lol."}
{"text":"not sure if I shall try the 3rd time. Ordered the beef hotpot ($29) and ramen ricecake hotpot ($16) add cheese (+$3) the second time.  The beef hotpot was ok, but overly seasoned with soy sauce and sugar. I remember I had to drinks tons of water afterwards. Second time went for a cheaper choice bearing in mind that sometimes price does not justify quality. However the ricecake hotpot was terrible...excessively spicy, sweet, and was undercooked. ramen and ricecake shall be softer imo. Service was good and I heard many good words about this place. Not sure if I'll try again. Still wanna give a shot though."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've had so far in Champaign. I thought woorijib was good, but this is even better. I normally don't like eating hotpot, but since they seem to specialize it in, I gave it a try. It was satisfying. The flavors are there with the right amount of spiciness. I would recommend it to anyone who likes korean food. The service was great too. We had the private room at the back. They checked on us consistently."}
{"text":"This is my third review on this retaurant, and this time I really can't say anything other than this.  You must visit this restaurant and order all-you-can-eat-grill.  I'm pretty sure that you'll rate this review as 'useful' after the first dish."}
{"text":"The food here is sub par - I tried their gookbap, ojinguh bokem(squid stir fry), dwenjang jjigae(soy bean paste soup) and pork rib kimchi jungol. All were disappointing, unfortunately. And judging by the photos from other reviewers, their budae jungol and kimchi fries look like a joke as well. They tend to be skimpy with their ingredients, and the food always tastes like it was made by that friend who loves cooking but doesn't have much of a talent for it."}
{"text":"My partner's coworkers recommended Yori Q; they sometimes go there for lunch. We stopped by for an early Sunday dinner and were the first customers. The decor is neutral, edging toward the utilitarian. Although weeds are growing outside the door, inside the restaurant was clean. Background music was playing, the strains typical of coffee-house alternative pop.  The waitress asked whether we preferred to be seated at the grill (see below) or at a table. We chose a table. The menu includes a range of appetizers, some of which are fusion, such as fried corn cakes, chadol tostadas, and kimchi fries. Sadly for me, the mandoo (dumplings) come as vegetable only, but vegetarians might appreciate the option.  We found the appetizer fusion a fun concept (it's supposed to be Yori Q's central theme), so we tried the chadol tostadas and kimchi fries. The chadol tosadas came as (2) tostadas (flat corn tortillas with a crunch) topped mainly with onions, shredded cabbage, and a trace amount of sliced meat (beef deckle, or ribeye cap). They tasted good, but did not wow us. The kimchi fries were underwhelming. The waffle fries, though plentiful and perfect for sharing, were almost certainly from a freezer (not prepared fresh on site). They were not seasoned -- not a grain of salt as far as we could tell. They had two mayo-based sauces squeeze-bottled onto them. The kimchi covered only the very top of the pile of fries and even with a very small amount of freshly fried bacon cubes sprinkled over lacked in flavor. The small waffle fry mountain was topped with a generous portion of finely shredded spring onions.  Of course, we also received banchan (side dishes), which are served before the meal in Korean bbq joints and often consist of housemade pickled things. In this case the banchan were kimchi, a sweet and sour cucumber and onion salad, cream-based coleslaw, cream-based macaroni salad with thinly sliced apples and celery, and sliced fish cake. We found the banchan underwhelming, too. They did not taste especially housemade, except for the cucumber and onion salad (just a hint more chili flavor than the standard Midwestern version). The kimchi was too mild. The coleslaw was not nearly as good as my mother's or mine. It lacked acid and black pepper. The macaroni salad was extremely bland, the whitest of white food. The sliced fish cake was almost certainly commercial.  Yori-Q offers a good range of entree styles, from hot plates to rice bowls, hot soups to cold noodles -- even three fusion burgers (bulgogi [beef], donkatsu [pork], and chicken). My partner and I chose the dolsat bibimbap with bulgogi added (my perennial favorite) and our son had the bulgogi rice bowl.   I enjoyed the dolsat bibimbap, which is a traditional (non-fusion) Korean dish of mixed vegetables (steamed) over rice with a fried egg on top, served in a stone bowl (dolsat) heated so that the rice cooks in oil spread on the bottom until it becomes crisp and flavorful. Yori Q used a plain vegetable oil rather than sesame oil as the base, which is too bad (a missed opportunity to produce authentic flavor). The vegetables in bibimbap can vary slightly. Here, they were shredded carrots and daikon, bracken fern, kimchi, mushrooms, and zucchini. I don't particularly care for bracken fern (which basically tastes like slightly saline, soft-cooked stems), but it is authentic. The other vegetables were delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked, too, still soft enough for tender texture and sweet flavor (my partner said it was the highlight of the dish). The bulgogi was also tasty and tender, but served in a very small portion (two small bites, tops). A commercial gochujang is served in a squeeze bottle on the side (traditional) -- this is a red chili paste that has a low-medium heat profile and the texture of ketchup. Also served on the side is a small dish of beef broth with scallions to pour over and moisten the dish (the first time anywhere I've received this with bibimbap -- I don't know that it added much to the overall experience, but it was fun to try something new with an old favorite). Our son's bulgogi rice bowl was similar to the dolsat bibimbap, only it included less vegetables (by his design). It did not include much more meat in the portion, which disappointed him. He loved the flavor of the bulgogi. He did not find the rice had much flavor; it made up the majority of the dish.  Would we go back? I love Korean food; my husband and son can take it or leave it. I'll probably go elsewhere for my fix, given other options in town. Some other Yelpers have mentioned that Yori Q has high prices, but $13 is about average for dolsat bibimbap and $7 isn't that bad for an appetizer at a nice restaurant. There are more expensive options on the menu, such as the $23 per person grill experience, but that is \"all you can eat,\" which seems reasonably priced. One final note: We overheard a customer ordering the bubble tea, which might make a fun addition to a meal."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance; it was clean, traditional, and professional.  Certainly, this did not feel like a cheap place and was way better than the \"cafeteria\" style restaurants on campus.  The prices were not bad either, the food tasted good, the place wasn't too crowded, there was plenty of parking, and decent service.  Just go here and try it out, it's a good place."}
{"text":"We had lunch box combo which is a nice box with some Korean side dish (tempura and some tofu) and rice. I ordered bulgogi beef. To be fair, the food there is good. Serving size is mediocre for a lunch box. The price is high with ridiculously high tips. Totally eight of us went there and we were forced to be charged a flat tip of over 18% but frankly speaking there was no service at all. In addition, it is the  horrible service that shocked me. The waiter was appallingly rude and stupid without any common sense. At first he could not figure out how many of us wanted ice water and how many wanted hot water. Then when one of my friend had his spicy squid, it was actually chicken. But he was told it was chicken. With doubt, my friend started to eat a little and realized it was indeed CHICKEN. When the waiter realized the mistake and this chicken lunch was meant for another friend of mine, he did something I had never seen in my life. He just WANTED TO HAND that dish to the guy waiting for his chicken even the dish had been eaten by someone else. Of course we requested a new dish should be served to our friend and we finished the lunch without even a water refill. I truly do not believe this type of service is worth any tip but we could not do anything since the so-called gratuity was printed on the bill! In a word, this is a place I would not go again and suggest you guys be aware of the service there."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch after hearing a lot of good reviews.  To say the least, most of the food was quite good with the exception of a few things.  The spicy pork bulgogi was coated quite well with a standard gochujang (spicy sauce) with marinade.  The meat itself is a decent cut that comes sparingly with fat portions.  Overall it was a pleasant taste, however, I still think K-Bowl wins in the meat category, hands-down.  4-star here.  I tried the ojinguh bokkeum (spicy stir fried squid) and found it to be slightly better, as the squid was cooked to just the right texture, as well as the sauce being more flavorful.  4.5-stars for the squid.  As for kimchi jjigae, this was perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal, and may have been a fluke considering I've heard mostly good things about their soups.  The soup tasted over-stewed and most of the normal \"kick\" of the flavor was boiled out... 2-star here.  As for the remainder dishes, the sides were OK at best.  Fish cake, macaroni, and assorted tempura, which was fried way too long.  The corn jeon (pan-fried korean corn pancake) starter was quite good, perhaps the highlight of the meal - overall a rather sweet and rich taste with a nice soft texture.  1-star for the sides but 4.5-stars for the corn jeon.  Overall, if only taste and preparation was accounted for I would give it a 3.5/5, but for the cost ($11-14 for soup and meat with sides) it certainly deserves a 4-star.  Update 9/23:  Ordered the same lunch combo but with soon tofu jjigae, which was much better.  Sides were perfect this time as well.  Definitely good enough for a 5/5 this time."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Korean fare. A bit overpriced compared to old standbys like Woor-i-jib."}
{"text":"Great service, uneven food.  The spicy pork slider was excellent.  The corn jeon pancake is pretty good too.  The Gamja Tang - spicy pork neck bone soup was sweat-inducing good - pungent, spicy, with large gelatinous pieces of neck bone stuff - old school food at its best.  The bulgogi is made with ribeye and is tasty.   The Dolset Bibimbap was not so good - where's the meat?  Customers were all pan-Asian types; looking around, most were getting hot pots of various types.  Next time will need to try one of those."}
{"text":"*Only about 60% of the menu has been released so far. I'm excited to see the rest!   Food- They don't skimp on their portions. I went with one other friend & we ordered the Bulgogi Jeongol & we had more than enough for a third person. Even perfect for a group of 4, if you want to eat a satisfying amount & know that you will get dessert afterwards ;) Side dishes were all very good too - just wish they had offered about 2-3 more.   Service- Really good & quick. Very friendly too! They're really good about filling up waters, empty side dishes, & such.   I can't wait for their dessert bar & grill area to open up!"}
{"text":"The best and only Korean restaurant around here. Some menus are unique to their own style, and they're actually really good. Oh and also their honeydew bubble tea was amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent food but could use some adjustments. I enjoyed the corn pancake appetizer a lot, it was delicious and chock-full of corn. I had the dolsat bibambap for my entree and it wasn't the best. I don't eat a lot of bibambap but this one had way too much rice and not enough stuff. There were also only about 4 or 5 very small pieces of bulgogi. I know bibambap is vegetable focused, but this was just disappointing. The worst part was the fried egg in the bibambap. It arrived at our table with a completely rock solid yolk. Even worse, the bowl next to mine's yolk was not only rock solid, but also broken, leaving a dried up trail around the bowl. Not good. However, the pork neck bone soup was well received and pleasantly spicy. The bulgogi entree was also very good, generous portion of beef to make up for the complete lack of beef in the bibambap. I didn't try the hot pot which they are supposedly known for. I'd recommend this place for bulgogi or soups/hot pot, but I'd stay away from the bibambap."}
{"text":"Very good. Food is great except kimchi soup is too spicy. Service is good and quick. Good for lunch. Will try some grill things next time."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in champaign urbana hands down. They've raised the prices recently but the food is definitely worth it. A must get is the corn jeon, or gamja jungal(I think that's what it is called). They recently decreased the portion size of the dolsot bimbamp which is slightly dissapointing but oh well. Bubble tea here is also one of the best I've had but not sure if it is worth $5. Gonna try kbbq on Wednesday."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that I got to try Yori Q finally! I came here in January with a coworker and I had the dolstot bibimbap which was good but I can't say it was the best in town. The veggies and sauce were awesome but the fried egg was over cooked in my opinion. There are so many korean restaurants in town and this place falls somewhere in the middle. If I'm in the area, and craving korean food, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Not a big selection and the Kimchi fries werent that great. The main dishes were so so and not many good side dishes. Overall 2 stars for the good customer service."}
{"text":"Finally a korean restaurant in town with great food and service. Too bad it opened weeks prior to my departure. After trying all the korean restaurants in town, I must say I was used to having to settle for restaurants with positive aspects and mediocre aspects, food wise, service, ambiance, price. Tried this place twice before leaving and both times I had a great experience. Having lived in Los Angeles I know the standards for korean restaurants pretty well. This place excelled in all aspects. For being a brand new restaurant the service was very attentive and fast, which is unusual for restaurants with training staff. They made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The ambiance hasn't change much since the last asian restaurant in the location but was given a rather simple but clean facelift. Ive tried the spicy chicken stew, naegmyon and other dishes and all of them where very flavourful and generous portions, especially considering other korean restaurants in town. If the service and food quality persist in this restaurant it will definitely be the go to place for everyone in town craving korean food."}
{"text":"They get a star for being open til 10, and the service wasn't bad, but wow, the food was just really not up to par. I ordered a dol sot bibimbap and the bowl wasn't hot enough to really crisp the rice, and there was barely any meat, like I really had to go hunting! The sides were just okay, and the kimchi was sorta dry... I don't have high expectations for Korean food in Champaign but it's not like it's the only place in town. I wanted to like this place but the food really disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a good get-together place for friends. Food is generally good. I especially like the corn jeon and the bulgogi mini-burgers. Hot pots are good, too."}
{"text":"I'd visited this place years ago before it was called \"Yori\". The downside is that it doesn't seem like the new owners have done anything to improve the physical restaraunt. The upside is that the food doesn't seem to care and still decides to taste good.  As others have noted, get the corn jeon, even though it's clearly a zillion calories.    I'm removing two stars because the area where we were seated was extremely cold (drafty windows and maybe they were also keeping the heat low). It was pretty uncomfortably cold.  But I'm adding a star back because the staff was very friendly and enthusiastic about serving us even though the place was empty and it was late.  I'd like to go back, and eat some more."}
