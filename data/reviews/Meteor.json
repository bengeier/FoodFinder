{"text":"Sandwich options were ok. More hotdog options though. Just past security. People that review about the slow service - keep in mind that my server had a limp. Just your basic airport bar. There are a couple of other places down the hall with more extensive menus if you're looking for more.."}
{"text":"As you clear security you are literally on top of this place.  Keep your expectations in line with the fact that you are in an airport and you should be okay.  I thought they offered a decent variety of things from bagels, muffins, sandwiches  etc..  Service was a bit slow"}
{"text":"Meteor is a fairly disgusting cafe/cafeteria right after security in Terminal 3, A gates. There are slim pickin's in these gates so you may be tempted or compelled to stop. If you can, don't bother....

Everything (even in the context of airport eats) is horrifically overpriced. A simple cheese plate - a few chunks of Brie, some grapes, a slice of fruit bread - $15!!!!! That might be ok if what I had was delicious but everything was pretty stale. 

Every single table in the eating area was coated with crumbs, sticky stuff and the general detritus of all of today's travelers. Of course, there were multiple employees standing around NOT cleaning. 

Meteor - grubby, overpriced and not worth your time."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that this is a review for an establishment at an airport and not a restaurant that one would go \"by choice\" - This is the only reason why I am giving this place 2/5 as opposed to 1/5. 

Terminal 3 has an awful food selection, even prior to going past security. It's so unfortunate because I have a great time in Terminal 1. 

Meteor has one type of \"hot food\" and thats basically their hotdogs. From the menu, you are tempted to try these awesome hotdogs with bbq pulled pork or chili. BUT, let me tell you that the hotdogs that you get, are essentially the crappy hotdogs found at your local supermarket for $2. Literally the WORST hotdog I have ever had. Unfortunately I keep forgetting that terminal 3 has no food options, so I have purchased from Meteor more than I like to admit- and every time, I curse myself. 

My most recent experience was 2 days ago, when I purchased the BBQ pulled pork hotdog with coleslaw. So now that we have established that the hotdog sucks, lets get into the BBQ pulled pork: it was just the worst pulled pork, with the tiniest amount of BBQ sauce placed on top. What you may ask? EXACTLY !!! The BBQ pulled pork wasn't BBQ pulled pork, it was simply pork with a spritz of mystery sauce. 
Oh and the \"coleslaw\" was dried cabbage with no sauce placed on top of the pulled pork. 
I paid $8 for that ! 

Sigh ... And the service was bad, the seating area was disgusting ... just awful. 

Hopefully my own review will remind me next time to eat before flying out of terminal 3."}
{"text":"This is not a place to get food. Don't do it. 

This is the first thing you see past security. It looks like it serves food, but all it has is those gross pre packaged sandwiches. It's not worth it.

What they do have are $5 beers. And an excellent spot for people watching. And an AT&T wireless hotspot. Screw that Boingo nonsense that works 25% of the time.

If you're flying out of Terminal 3, do yourself a favor and bring snacks. The choices are all meh at best and a section of the terminal is usually closed, further reducing your options."}
