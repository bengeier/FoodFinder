{"text":"If you like Pork BBQ then Thursday is the day to grab lunch at the cafeteria. They bring in a caterer, Ranucc's Big Butt BBQ, who cooks up fresh BBQ, sauces and sides. I ate there a couple of months ago and this is the best Pork BBQ in the Charlotte and surrounding areas."}
{"text":"I ate here in July of 2015. The cafeteria has clearly been updated since the previous comments. There was a typical selection of cafe food/private vendors. I had sushi and the food was prepared quickly and tasted great."}
{"text":"This place has the worst cafe food that I've ever eaten... worse than hospital food, which is pretty bad. Even the salad selection is horrible.  Avoid anything with seafood. It's overcooked and dry. Avoid rice as well for the same reason.  In fact, avoid this place altogether.  The only reason why it gets a second star is because they bring in outside restaurants in the \"Cultural Exchange\" section, which has good food from places such as JohnnyBurrito."}
{"text":"This is a really good company caf√© that has been updated in recent years. The cooks all seem to come from cooking school in town, and it is professionally managed. It is inexpensive as well. This morning I had a veggie omelet, fresh fruit, coffee, juice and it was cheaper than going through fast food drive through. It was not the absolutely best omelet, but it was not bad. The fruit was typical grocery store fare, and since it happens to be berry season in Florida, well, this stuff probably came a long ways from overseas on a slow boat ... oh well. The people who work here are all friendly. It was a good meal."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times when I'm meeting a blue badge friend for lunch. I'd recommend going with the pizza if you have to, or the made-to-order deli sandwich if the line isn't too long. There is a schedule of outside providers that take over one of the serving slots - I've had the barbecue once and it was awesome.  And of course because it's Microsoft, the drinks are gratis.  There's fruit available too, but I'm not sure if they have *wink* apples *wink*.  I always tighten my tin foil hat as I drive past the FBI office next door."}
