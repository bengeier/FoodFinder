{"text":"Changement de nom pour \" Le Petit Chablis\". Menu cuisine nouvelle. Très belle terrasse exterieure. Excellent ratio qualite/prix. Réservation suggèree car peu de table."}
{"text":"Nous avons apprécié le repas, nous étions 5 et 4 ont pris les menus d'hôte. En général nous avons passé une bonne soirée et le rapport qualité prix était convenable.
Le service est super, ils ont été aux petits soins, très agréable.
Quant aux repas nous avons été assez déçus des jarret d'agneaux, la sauce ne nous a pas plût et la purée n'était pas assez salée. Les autres plats étaient très bon. Le tournedos de filet mignon, le magret de canard... En bref, des ajustements à faire au niveau finition, mais la qualité était au RDV.

Nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"La nourriture est excélente, le service est super, le chef viens vous voir aux tables pour s'assuré que nous apprécions notre repas. 

J'y étais allé pour l'anniversaire de ma copine et elle avait oublié son porte-feuille ainsi que tout son argent reçu en cadeau, ils nous ont contacté et tout y était encore!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant. My family was visiting the Montreal area for the past two weeks and were staying at a house in the Saint Lambert area. We dined at many amazing restaurants in Montreal during our stay but this place stands out on top. The owner is so nice as is the fabulous waiter who truly wants you to have the best experience. We dined two nights in a row on their lovely outdoor patio and had an amazing dinner. Both evenings we ordered from their $40 3 course prix fixe menu and were blown away. The plating on everything is just beautiful and they have some very unique dishes! Even the bread they serve is delicious. 

The first night i ordered the smoked salmon and portabello mushroom appetizer which came with a garnish of masago and cucumber and little dollops of some kind of fruit preserve - it was delicious. For my entree i had the duck in the sweet and sour berry sauce which came with pesto mashed potatoes and some veggies, it was some of the best duck i have ever dad and again just beautiful plating. For dessert i had the poached pear in the white chocolate sauce - so good! They even custom made a beautiful veggie plate for my aunt who just wanted vegetables for her entree, they were so accommodating!

They also had a lot of lovely specials that were not on the menu but the prix fixe was such a good deal! 

The next night i ordered the chicken liver mousse and onion jam appetizer which was just as good as everything else i had and in an attempt to be adventurous i ordered the kangaroo. The waiter could tell i was not happy with the kangaroo dish which i found to be tough and gamey tasting and asked me to be honest. He immediately offered to get me a different entree. I ordered the pesto pasta with shrimp and mussels and was blown away by how good the pasta was. I am not a huge fan of mussels but it was a huge portion of them. I was so full that i took my dessert of strawberry shortcake home and had it for breakfast the next morning. 

I cannot recommend this place enough. Amazing service and delicious food with beautiful plating. Truly a gem in this little town and very reasonably priced for the quality and portion of food."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend for a much needed vacation with very close friends/ family who are from the area. I have eaten at many brasseries/ cafes.  This cozy, family run restaurant is outside of the city of Montreal  in St. Lambert and was by far One of the best French restaurants I have eaten at. Very traditional, rich, decadent flavors. From foi gras, duck confit, calfs liver, rabbit shoulder, sweet breads, stingray etc. Everything including dessert is made to order so be patient with service. I will definitely be back for more!"}
