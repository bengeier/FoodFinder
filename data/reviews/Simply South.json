{"text":"Great authentic south Indian food with a brand new set up with beautiful decor,
We ordered two types of Dosa; Ghee Masala Dosa and Chilly Rava Masala Dosa. Both came with 3 different chatni (coconut, tomato and green). Everything was fresh, and your tastebuds would \"thank you\" for the delicious and fresh food. Owner takes a pride and personal attention ensuring all guests are comfortable. Taste, price, service and decor all are top notch. Most authentic south indian food in the whole GTA, a must visit place!"}
{"text":"We were recently driving by this restaurant and decided to check it out for my moms birthday. I was very impressed with the interior decor of this restaurant and the service was amazing. Our server came to us many times to make sure we had enough Sambar with our dosas and filled up our water. I ordered the masala dosa which has potatoes and onions inside. I got it spicy and I must say it was pretty spicy, along with the sambar. 

For dessert we ordered a plate of pista kulfi ice cream which was absolutely delicious! It's a round shaped kulfi ice cream served on a plate and it is cut into small pieces which is easy to share if you like!  

I will definitely recommended this place to my family and friends and will return myself very soon! The prices are also very reasonable with most dosas starting at $8.50 which includes the sambar and three chutneys on the side."}
{"text":"Food was ok and its too expensive I would better go to Gurulaxmi in Mississauga and BTW 15% gratuity is mandatory either u go alone or in a group."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a decent dosa spot that is close by so we don't have to travel all the way to Albion. We came across this one from one of my dads clients. Me and my mom are huge fans of dosa so we decided one evening to go out to grab some dinner. The decor in the place is so beautiful, it's antique. It reminds me of old Punjab dishes. We both ordered Mango Lassi with Mysore Masala Dosa. We loved the dosa and the dish they brought it in. I'm not a huge fan of mango lassi I would prefer mango milkshake. If you are in the area, you should try this place out."}
{"text":"We ordered medu vada, dal vada and 2 masala dosa.
Things we didn't like:-
Both vada were undercooked, only one server, the masala in potato wasn't up to the mark for me, not value for money

Things we liked:-
Sambar was the best we have tasted yet in GTA, the one server was very humble and nice (kept asking if we needed anything the entire time we were eating), the ambience n overall look was good

I may or may not visit again!"}
{"text":"Been there many times.. Simply awesome. Loved the food.. So far the best south Indian restaurant in Canada. Menu is wide. Everyone can find something in menu.. Owner is also nice. She is really nice. Keep the same taste and service long way to go."}
