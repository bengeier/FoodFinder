{"text":"Came through to check this new place out last night with The Wife to celebrate our 11th Anniversary and our first night out without The Newborn.  Had been to Oggi before and it was good, not fantastic and expensive for what you got, I thought.

I liked the idea of a new American bistro in town especially after Cork and Cleaver closes soon.  Our waitress was polite and enthusiastic, perhaps a little eager to get our drink orders.  We needed time to look at the menu first.  Eventually we ordered the Moscow Mule which was tasty.

The menu was smaller than I expected, but that is probably wise for a soft opening.  We ordered some Thai Coconut Shrimp Curry noodles and the 24 hour short rib dish as well as a tomato salad.

How was the food?  Some highs some lows.  The bread was tasty, with a better texture and crumb than most dipping breads I've had.  Other than that however, most of our meals were underwhelming, especially for the price.  Our tomato salad didn't have much tomatoes in it and buffalo mozzarella was strangely gamey and had a more spongy texture than other fresh mozzarella I've had.  Enjoyed the croutons though.

Sous vide meat is supposed to be meltingly tender and short ribs especially so.  These were not- they were overdone either during the final sear or in the sous vide cooker.  There was a generous portion of meat, but it was under seasoned.  I found myself adding salt to a lot of my food which I hardly ever do in restaurants.  Baked beans were ok. But honestly when I'm paying for a $24 plate of short ribs, I'm hoping for something more interesting than baked beans. The coleslaw needed for acidity and salt as well.

Our Thai noodles dish was a similar mixed picture.  The highlight was these big beautiful and perfectly cooked shrimp.  I rarely see American restaurants cook in this style (frying it whole so that you can eat the shell).  They were a joy to eat and a pretty good value. Everything else however was underwhelming.  I would personally suggest maybe a thicker, perhaps wheat noodle instead of the rice vermicelli noodles because they didn't hold the broth well and quickly became soggy.  The curry was under seasoned- though better once the chili sauce that was served on the side was added.  Thai food is intense and flavorful, I felt this dish was a bit neutered. 

Overall it was an OK experience.  A bit pricey for food that I had to alter a fair amount to make it palatable.  The owner asked how things went and took feedback graciously which I appreciate.  That will serve the restaurant and hopefully help it to be successful.  Ultimately, it was probably more of a 3.5 star meal but I'll round up because it is new and local. 

As for me, I'll probably end up going to Cantine more across the street, especially during their Sunday happy hours.  Will stop by again if the reviews warrant it after they've had the chance to settle down and perfect their food."}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant for the first time tonight and can honestly say it is one of the best meals we have had in a long time! The service really took this meal above and beyond. Everything we had was wonderful; great wine and food. I had tomato bisque and tomato salad- the homemade lemon ricotta was phenomenal! My husband had the salmon which was also amazing. Our sever was nice enough to bring a sample of the limoncello martini which I will definitely be getting next time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were fans of the previous restaurant at this location (Oggi), but we like to support local, independent restaurants and so we continued to frequent this restaurant after Carmela del Busso sold it to Joe and Sarah Rutigliano.  Joe and Sarah have just started putting their touches on the business with a new name, and a new menu.

They chose the Bistro concept so that they could vary the menu and branch out beyond Italian food.  That said, I do hope they keep some Italian dishes on the menu (they offer a spaghetti Bolognese, but I haven't tried it).  I did try their wonderful meatball and polenta appetizer, but sadly it didn't make it on the new menu. 

On our last visit I had the 6oz filet, it had a nice flavorful crust and came with a pancetta, potato and carrot hash and a delicious fennel cream.  My wife had the Salmon over grilled vegetables served over a wonderful celery root pur√©e--she said it was the best Salmon dish she ever ate!

The cozy bar remains and they have a nice selection of cocktails.  Many customers, including us, eat at the bar and it was nice that Joe and Sarah came out and talked to all of us about their new menu.  They were very interested in suggestions/recommendations for the menu.  

They are also planning on updating the outdoor seating area.

Starting a new restaurant is tough, but so far, they are off to a good start.  We are looking forward to see how this restaurant evolves."}
