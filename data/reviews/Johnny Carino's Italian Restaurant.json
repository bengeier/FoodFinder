{"text":"As always, great service and awesome food. Half off family platters on Mondays! Enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Bowtie festival and Angle Hair & Meatballs w/ marinara... 2.00 mini deserts..."}
{"text":"Great food for a chain....

I especially love the jalapeno talapia and chocolate tiaramissu.
until recently I would have given them 5 stars...but I got a rib eye that was tough...guess I should have said something....I'm pretty sure they would have fixed it as they have good service...but we had so much food I just enjoyed other things...I realized that Steak is probably best at a steak place and Italian places are best for pasta and other Italian.

Service is top notch,,,,nice atmosphere
reasonable prices
portions are kind of big...could easily share a plate with someone"}

{"text":"Tried Carino's with a group of about 12 people a couple months ago and I was surprisingly pleased! 

For appetizers we ordered calamari (which was light and yummy), baked stuffed mushrooms (vegetarian) and Sicilian fire sticks (deliciousness). I had the house salad which was much better than the Caesar. 

My husband had the sausage skilletini which he wasn't too happy with. They offered him a separate plate to put it on and had he done that, I think he would have liked his meal a little more. I ordered the lobster ravioli which was one of the best that I've had. 

We were too full to order dessert but they looked delicious - so maybe next time. 

There is a pretty big wine list that isn't too overpriced so we ordered a bunch of bottles. Was pleased with all of them."}
{"text":"Had a spontaneous early dinner here with Mom a few weeks ago after a long day of all kinds of shopping in Robinson Town Centre.  While not particularly life-changing, Carino's did the trick and provided us with some much-needed energy for the drive home and emptying of the vehicle.

I thought the complimentary hot bread and olive oil with dried garlic chunks was Heaven at the time...or maybe I was just starving.  A combination of both, I think.

The Honey Pecan-Crusted Salmon Salad I ordered was a monster.  Huge, much bigger than the photo I took leads one to believe.  I wouldn't say the chopped pecans were \"crusted\" onto the fish, but, in any event, there was a serious amount of tasty pecans present. The vinaigrette was nice.  Would have liked to see the tomatoes cut into much smaller pieces.

My mom really liked her Spicy Chicken Romano dish, and I thought it was decent taking into consideration that simple boxed dry pasta was clearly used.  Not too spicy at all, and I enjoyed the big chunks of cheesy artichokes.  Did she really order the lunch-sized portion though?  It was quite a pile of food!  Again, my photo doesn't do the portion size justice. 

I found Carino's d√©cor, food quality, and service to be that of a fairly typical chain restaurant:  good in a pinch but not something I'd go out of my way to experience.  A-OK."}
{"text":"A perfect dish Of pasta with a twist. The sauce is to die for! Sausage a little overcooked but good flavor. The thing that puts it over the top is the \"taste of the skillet\". Can't be mistaken, you can't beat cast iron."}
{"text":"We've been to Carino's several times now and have never been disappointed. No matter what we order, the food is always excellent and the service is top-notch. 

This time around I had the Chicken Marsala, which was wonderfully tender and very tasty. I've also, on previous visits, had the Chicken Milano (a very rich dish with ham and cheese layered on the chicken, served with fettuccini), the spaghetti with meat sauce, and the grilled chicken bowtie pasta. All were excellent.

I would highly recommend Carino's for anyone looking for good tasting northern Italian food, not the tasteless \"traditional\" food that passes for Italian here in Pittsburgh."}
