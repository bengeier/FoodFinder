{"text":"Rapide et délicieux! Le Combo soupe et rouleau est parfait pour un petit snack d' après-midi et c'est pas trop cher."}
{"text":"Food served super fast. Service is super good and super friendly. Good portions. Medium tasting food. I will come again."}
{"text":"Quick, simple, filling food, which I feel is very much in the spirit of pho. I personally didn't find the beef too tough or the noodles under-cooked: quite the opposite, the amount of beef you get for a under-$10 bowl of soup is excellent and the noodles weren't mushy, as rice noodles can sometimes been in soup. Also, the service is wonderful and the setting so urban 80's-diner that it's impossible not to relax."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and grew up eating pho so this is definitely my forte. Food is served very fast meaning everything is already prepared or cooked the broth is too sweet and just not how pho is suppose to taste. The beef is tough and noodles are too undercooked. Overall the bowl of pho doesn't give you that warm, cozy, hearty feeling it's suppose to. I rarely come here and when I do it's disappointing and a waste of money. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"It's cheap and fresh but not stellar."}
{"text":"What is there to say? It's a tiny restaurant that serves you utilitarian Pho but its hearty, packed with noodles and beef and keeps your tummy filed and warms you up. And they serve it really fast. Is it the Pho ever? Hardly but it works, you get it fast and its dirt cheap. Great for a quick lunch. I'm a fan."}
