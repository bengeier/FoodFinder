Do NOT play pool there.  I asked the bartender about leveling the table, and he said he told the owner, and the owner does not seem to care.  Also there is not enough room around the tables.  Maybe they could make 2 tables work in the limited space, but for 3 there is NOT enough room.

People vote with their feet and money.  Then businesses wonder why they are going under."}

This bar is a traditional sports bar so if you're looking to have a quick beer or shoot a game of pool, this is just as good as any.  However, if you're looking for a good spot to grab and beer and a meal w/a buddy, you might skip this establishment.  Every time I've been in the music has always been loud and obnoxious. Music always sucks too but other that just being my opinion it HAS to be a coincidence. Food....yea not so much.  Painfully obvious the \"cook\" is just some joe blow who makes minimum wage and doesn't pay attention to detail.  I had the turkey sandwich which should of been a bread sandwich cause that's what it tasted like. My friend had the steak caesar salad and the steak was raw and in his words, \" like chewing rubber\"."}
