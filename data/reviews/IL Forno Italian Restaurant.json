{"text":"HORRIBLE dining experience tonigt!! Service was terrible, slow and unfriendly. Customers who came in after us by at least 30 min were served food before we were ( both of us ordered pizza ).  Dirty tables not bussed until customers came in and needed to be seated. Heard a customer be told there were no more clean plates... Finally after an hour and a half our bruschetta came out, but the crust was burnt terribly and they tried to cover it up with extra tomatoes. When asked if our pizza was coming soon, was told it had not been started yet!!! Told the server to cancel it and she brought us a check for our drinks!!! Paid cash for our drinks, which should have been comped in my opinion, the server told me they had no change!!  She then had to get me change from her purse. Watched 2 other tables walk out after us! Will NEVER go back!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to you Yelpers we found this wonderful restaurant for the rehearsal/welcome dinner for forty-eight guests for the night before our son's and daughter-in-law's wedding.  Matt, the manager, put together a versatile menu that consisted of salad, eggplant parmesal, salmon, chicken marsala, New York strip steak, and dessert.  The tables looked beautiful, complete with vases with red and white roses.  Giorgiano, the owner and chef prepared the meals with skill and love.  Everything was delicious, from start to finish.  The bartender, Don, and the wait staff were warm, kind and hard-working - they all went above and beyond expectations.  We truly thank everyone at Il Forno for a memorable evening.  We highly recomment this restaurant.  (We've sampled the pizza before - extraordinary.)"}
{"text":"WOW!  I am very, very surprised to read all the positive reviews for this place.  We had sticker shock when reading the menu, which looked like it was printed from a home computer.  A spaghetti and meatball dinner is 13 dollars WITHOUT a dinner salad!  Other pasta based entree's were around $15-19.  Not filet mignon or a lobster tail, just pasta, ALSO WITHOUT a dinner salad.  The caesar salad we ordered was HORRIBLE.  Can you say VINEGAR dressing???  We ordered a pizza that ended up tasting like a frozen pizza you buy from the store.  The wine glasses were tiny and the wine was cheap.  I changed my glass of wine for something at least drinkable.  The couple next to us had the same problems, and experience.  When the owner came out to their table argued with them and didn't offer a discount on their meal.  I'm sure they will never be dining there again, as we will not either.  SAD, because it would have been nice to have a quaint place to eat just down the road from us."}
{"text":"Great light crusted pizza  just like from Brooklyn.   They use homemade Mozarella.   Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly enough but slow. We were ready for our bill before we were given any drink refills. The food was very good but the portion sizes were disappointing for the cost. For a $19 pasta dish you would expect a \"family style\" portion or at least plenty for one, and it was not nearly enough for one, nor did it come with a soup or salad to at least tide you over. Also, I know this is petty, but the bread loaves are also really small. Wouldn't go back because of high cost alone."}
{"text":"Excellent place, great food and good service. One of those hidden gems! We recently discovered it, and we keep coming back. Guarantee not to disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in East Mesa. Food is consistently good. Friendly service. The Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and Lasagna are winners. Good place for casual conversation."}
{"text":"Tried this tonight.  We were the only folks there, not a good sign.  I had the eggplant and my friend had the chicken Marsala. It was bland sauce on over cooked noodles and the eggplant was cooked to death.  The chicken was not much better.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here. It tastes authentic and fresh. This place beats the other Italian restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, the salad was great.

The prices on the menu for certain things were not,  $10-13 for a starter to me seems ridiculous. 

Their $10 off coupon doesn't work anymore, even though it's still on here.  

Overall the food for a first time there was great, but with the prices being a bit higher than most other places ... IL Fornos will not be frequent stop but probably a place to order and pick up pizza from once and awhile."}
{"text":"I love Pizza, but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings."}
{"text":"I'm giving the food 5-stars. Outstanding. I had the home made stuffed pasta and a cannoli for desert. Delicious. Only small nit pick is that the restaurant decor is lacking. Bit of a cross between chinese buffet and italian bistro. But food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great service, sauce was really good! 
Had the pesto fetuccinni,  no complaints, was really good. 
Other plate was the chicken parm. The sauce was awesome!!! However the chicken was way over cooked and over sauced. It was rubbery.  This was unfortunate since everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"They need an eighth of a star, food terrible, service terrible, Tenn dollars off, non existent, do yourself a favor and go across the street to Pacinos, better selection of beer, wine and spirits plus the food is excellent"}
{"text":"If you like Chef Boyardee-style pasta and Red Baron pizza, and love absolutely wasting money try Il Forno today. 
You can't beat their overpriced entrees, and leaving still hungry with a significantly depleted bank account is my idea of a good dinner. 
Of course, I am insane...you may be too if you like this joke of an Italian eatery!"}
{"text":"We ate there when it first opened and the pizza was raw in the middle. Granted, they had just opened so we decided to give them another chance. They are supposedly famous (with awards even) for their pizza. Why, I wonder? The pizza was nothing to write home about, there was so much oregano on it I couldn't taste anything but that, and they charged us to switch out the meat. I ate it only because I was starving. My Caesar wasn't good since the dressing (which they make) had far too much vinegar and the croutons came straight out of a box. The bread which looked like it should be good, tasted like nothing. The food is ridiculously overpriced - there is plenty of delicious Italian food in the area that is reasonable. Also, a split charge? I don't support that. And the wine list - let me just say if your food is going to be that expensive, then you should have some decent wine to go with it.  Too many TV's - why would I pay $18 or more dollars for an entr√©e to be bombarded by TV I don't want to watch or hear? And yes, like other reviewers I thought the service wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Man, I love their pizza at this place! I just wish it wasn't so expensive! $20 for a pizza is too much. For this area, the prices need to come down...then you'll pack them in because the food is really good. Just sell more product!!!"}
{"text":"It took a long time to get food. Friend ordered a salad for dinner and instead of bringing out both at the same time as we asked my friend got her soup and salad early and finished her soup and salad by the  30 minute mark. I was still waiting. I waited over 45 minutes total. Finally, I told them to skip my order. They comped the soup and salad but no manager came out to apologize. Still I am giving a three star since my experience may have been unusual and since the waitress seemed new."}
{"text":"Um ok so we orderd some food to go and it took an hour. We sat in here for an hour and there was literally 5 people here and they got their food before us. Terrible service they need to act their act together. We didn't even get our salad please get your act together"}
{"text":"Finally!!!!! Awesome Italian food in North East Mesa. I had the lasagna and cheese pizza. The sauce had so much flavor and the pizza was a perfect crust. You can taste the freshness in every bite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I thought the place was going to be okay when we decided to give it a try.  But they definitely exceeded our expectations to the point where we went back about a week later.  The food and service were great both times we went there.  The pizza in particular is excellent!"}
{"text":"OMG. We found a tiny gem in east mesa with the most amazing food and service. Found a $10 off coupon on Yelp that apparently was from the previous owners but they totally honored it. Good public relations. You have got to try this place it is amazing."}
{"text":"the homemade pasta parpadelli  with shrimp was fantastic.  The only negative was service was very slow."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the East Valley. Cooked over wood and it shows in the flavor of the crust."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I have eaten several times at this restaurant.  Suddenly, the prices have increased!  $10 for a small glass of wine that would be 1/2 glass at any other restaurant is outrageous.  On my most recent visit (8/15/2013) we were the only couple in the place. My Veal Parmiegana  was burnt and salty.  Being kind, the food was VERY average, but definately not worth the price.  Sorry to see this restaurant change.  We had hoped we finally had a good Italian restaurant in our neighborhood. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I don't know what Brendan M. was talking about. Maybe he's never seen grated parmesan before... ;)
I brought my 4 and 7 year-old daughters for an early dinner. Wonderful waiter. Very experienced. 
I love linguini with clams/white sauce, I've had it many times at many great restaurants over the years, so I tried theirs. It was delicious and I was surprised from the bite of the crushed red peppers; if you don't like a little heat, order without, it will taste superb either way. There must have been at least 12 clams surrounding the linguini. Perfect sauce; just enough clam juice, white wine, butter, etc. Didn't taste any garlic. 
My daughters split the lasagna. These are ALL homemade dishes and it's a family restaurant. The atmosphere was pleasant. They have a decent wine list, though I didn't order off of it. We took 1/2 the lasagna home for Daddy and he loved it, too. The lasagna is slightly sweet, and the layers of pasta, meat and sauce are terrific. I am picky and I was impressed with this place. We will be back soon. Thanks."}
{"text":"jUST VISITED TOniGHT AND WILL NOT RETURN.  Service iswonderful andpleasant but they only can serve wat they get.  I waned Chardonnay and it was awful and sent it back.  VelParm came fried in margerine and then baked to melt the smalamount of cheese, sauce was extremely salty, pportion size was good, no salad with meal at $17.  Atmosphere pleasant, cloth table cloths 2 sports tvs.soft music.  I will not return because of wine choice and fried veal which had to be cut with a knife, not fork tender.Over priced for the quality and ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunches and dinner. Never a disappoint. The pasta is delicious. The pizza is tasty and filling. The sandwiches are wonderful. Ask the staff for their recommendations. They are always helpful and friendly.  A favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This has to be the best pizza in mesa. This is my first time visiting IL FORNO and this is my new neighborhood pizza place. Everything tasted homemade and fresh. Service was prompt and very friendly."}
{"text":"Anyone looking for great traditional Italian food in Mesa? This is the place. The food is always really good and the servers are really friendly. I always enjoy eating here. Try the Quatro Gussi pizza!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. But it is very over priced for dinner. We tried it twice. I just can't make myself go back. I hope they change their ways....."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade food! My husband and i are having lunch here right now for our first time and the food is so good couldn't wait to review them. So here I am eating my ravioli's and starter bread and typing. The staff is very friendly as well. We just bought a house out here at mountain bridge (having it built) this will be our restaurant of choice here! Glad we found them"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and salad   plus if you want some desert Dunkin Donuts is next door :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for over a year now- which is about 9 months longer than I ever would have originally guessed (only because its Mesa were talking here)...and it's because of the food. Basically, it is ridiculously good. On a whim, my wife and two young sons decided we would try this restaurant because we've been hearing some things. We sat down and received quick service, amazing dinner bread, and a smiley server. We ordered calamari and found out that their dipping sauce is incredible. We then ordered a half n half pizza and I ordered their salmon salad. GOOD LORD that salmon was perfect and cooked just right and hot as molten lava over a plate of fresh greens and tasty balsamic. I'm talking about a salad here! (Oh, and their pizza rivals ANYTHING in Manhattan or that Grimaldi garbage.) Then, we ordered their cheesecake for desert. This was my least favorite part, only because I'm not a fan of strawberries and \"froufrou\" on top of my cheesecake. But it was still killer. My wife loved it. My kids hoovered it up. Basically, this place is DAMN GOOD."}
{"text":"Got eggplant parm and subbed fettuccini Alfredo for the spaghetti. Perfectly cooked, crunchy, not greasy. Right amount of food to eat and not be stuffed but full. Husband had chicken parm and was so soft he could cut with a fork. Would go back if we weren't visiting from out of town and def recommend."}
{"text":"We have searched the valley for a good Italian restaurant for five years.  This is the best we've found so far!  The food is incredible, made from scratch, and very fresh.  I always judge Italian places by the quality of the sauces and this place does it right."}
{"text":"We called in an order for a pizza last Friday at 4:15pm to be picked up at 5pm.  We arrived right at 5pm and the guy in front said it would be \"5 minutes\" although there was only one other table occupied in the place, and they were leaving.  Ten minutes later a woman finally came out from the back and started making our pizza, studiously avoiding looking at us or talking to us although we were standing right in front of the prep station.  After putting the pizza in the oven, she quickly went into the back room until she had to take it out.  She gave it to the young guy in front to give to us rather than facing us herself and she appeared to be the manager, no less.  SHE should have come to talk to us and apologize.  Unfortunately, this type of poor service has happened to us at this restaurant before so we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a \" realy good\" Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area for 6 years...Today we found it in Mesa. Visiting the Emilia Romanga area of Italy in 2012 and experiencing \"real\" hand made pasta makes me not settle for less.  Do try this restaurant.  Their parpadella with shrimp is a combination of delicate flavors and tender pasta that made me want to swoon.  None of that glommy alfredo sauce but a tender blend of herbs in a light cream sauce.   Very Very good.  Can not wait to go back. 
 We have a friend wanting Veal Parm, its on the menu, we called him to try it out.  I am sure it will be awesome.  

We were there early, 4pm on a Saturday so getting in was no problem-therefore  the noise level was very low.  The staff is also very friendly.  

Being a bread snob, their's was too \"wonder bread texture\" for me. I would have rather had  a hearty artesian crisp crust, dense interior to dip into the olive oil.  But that won't keep me from a repeat visit.  So glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Went in tonight. One large party in the middle of the dining room. Nice ambiance. Very unwelcoming hostess/waitress. Very shy and timid.  Very awkward. 

Ordered a 16\" pizza with pepperoni and black olives. Asked for extra sauce and received almost no sauce on the pizza. Very skimpy with the cheese. Good amount of pepperoni and olives.  The dough and crust were very good. They obviously use good extra virgin olive oil because I picked that out right away in the flavor of the crust. 

Overall the flavor of the pizza was very good. 

The dining room was immaculate. Ceiling fans were spotless which is a detail I always look for.  Though there was not enough kitchen help to put food out in a reasonable amount of time. This is considering that the bake time for a thin crust pizza is short and the lack of guests in the dining room.  I may go back out of sheer curiosity and try one of the pasta dishes. However the prices are a little steep considering the dishes are a la carte. No salad or soup included."}
{"text":"Tried to use their 10 off offer and they said the current owner doesn't  do yelp anymore.   Not a good way to start off."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant that I've been to in a long time!! I've been there several times and everything is homemade and delicious!! Great pizza, pasta, and of course the homemade bread is out of this world!! The owner is from Cicily, Italy and really knows is stuff! Great Chef, Great Waitstaff, nice atmosphere and GREAT food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! They bring out fresh bread seasoned perfectly. The pizza is thin crust, reminded me of Grimaldis, very fresh ingredients. The lasagna is perfect with a good portion of meat. Best Italian food I've eaten in a long time"}
{"text":"Mmm Mmm Good pizza!!  The dough is so light, crunchy, and chewy.  We ordered the house special pizza and I kid you not you can taste the quality of every ingredient used to make this delicious masterpiece!!!  

My order took longer than what I was told, but who cares!!?? My patience paid off and the whole  family loved the pizza just as much as I did.  Also a little pricier than most but I personally think it's well worth it

UPDATE:  So i bought 2 16\" pizzas last night, warmed up the last 4 slices in the oven the next AM and THAT PIZZA IS SUPER DELICIOUS reheated in the oven.  Waiting for them to open so we get another for brunch, NO B.S. it is that mmm mmm good"}
{"text":"Went there for first time,will be the last!I had lobster ravioli,5 pieces came with no side,my wife had chicken parm,compared to many other places we dine at,again small portions,but heavy on the bill! Service was average,left hungry!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant a few times now. Our first time was with friends who told us about it as they live nearby (we live in Gilbert). We had a couple bottles of wine and all had entrees. They have several 'homemade' pastas daily in addition to the regular pasta meals. My husband had the homemade Fusilli which has red sauce, peppers, mushrooms and ground up Italian sausage. The noodles are smooth and not spiral like typical fusilli but man it was so good you don't care! It was delicious!! I had the pasta in a vodka sauce with shrimp. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly cooked. The pasta was al dente and the sauce was rich and tasty. They serve a wonderfully soft italian bread with butter and parm w/seasonings over the top which is really good!! We really liked the place so returned to try the pizza. The wood fired oven really makes a great pie! It is definitely in the top pizzas here in the Valley which says a lot from an east coast gal! Their brushetta, which is like a pizza without sauce or cheese just the brushetta toppings, on a small pizza dough crust is really good as well. Lots of fresh garlic which we just LOVE! My husband continually gets the fusilli each time we go as he just loves it...that's his staple dish. I like to try new things. I tried the shrimp scampi the last time I was there and it was SO good..the sauce is different than I've had before...so good you wanted to just eat more bread dipped in the sauce until it was gone. Our friends had the seafood (mussels, shrimp etc) dish and said it was very good and also the pesto alfredo which I tried and have to say it was as amazing! They are supposed to be introducing a larger bar menu in October (other than beer and wine which they had previously) with some specialty drinks so I'll be looking forward to another visit soon to try one out!! Oh and we had the lemon dessert and my daughter had the spumoni...both were delish! The lemon cake was simply terrific!!"}
{"text":"First time was a charm!

After a few years of driving by this place, we stopped in tonight to try it. Glad we did! Food was delicious, and we met the owner/cook, who prepares everything fresh, and by himself. Service was a bit slow, but it was due to the care and personal attention of the owner.

Highlight was the chicken pesto pizza...best I've ever had. Shrimp scampi appetizer was also fantastic. Fresh baked bread was great, as was the Il Forno pizza. Wood-fired crust makes the pies!

We'll be back...soon. Can't wait to try the homemade pastas. Also happy to support a small business."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant.  The food is awesome. The lasagna is to die for.  This is my new favorite place to eat. Great atmosphere and great staff A must do!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant went to try it out for lunch and it was closed. The open sign was turned on, the hours listed said it would be open at 11, it was 11:15 and the door was locked. We knocked and got the attention of a lady inside who came and open the door and said there was no chef and sometimes he is an hour late. Very disappointed was looking forward to trying this restaurant. Don't know if we'll ever be back..."}
{"text":"Yummm-E! Just heard about Il Forno being in the hood. I LOVE Italian, so hubby and I gave it a try. The place was busy but didn't have to wait for a table. Waitress brought fresh warm bread to the table that was slathered in garlic and olive oil, to hold us over while we waited for our pizza. Hubby ordered a house salad, and received a VERY generous portion (so we shared).  I gotta tell ya, the pizza was the best I've had in Arizona!  Seriously!  I had to hold back from eating the whole thing. The crust was perfect and toppings were fresh with sausage, and I understand mozzarella, made in-house. The sauce was just right for me!  So good!  I look forward to going back and trying some of their pasta dishes. Oh happy day!"}
{"text":"Service sucked. Told to seat ourselves. 10 minutes later finally brought menu and asked what we wanted to drink. Still no silverware. Asked for wine menu, never came back and asked us what we wanted. Over 30 minute wait for food. Get it together! Will not be returning. Hire someone who knows how to be a waitress. Not cheap. Salads not included.my husband ordered lasagna which was sweet. They brought him his and I watched him eat for 5 minutes. Finally my dinner came, eggplant parmesan. It was burnt and flavorless with a huge  slab of mozzarella on it. This place was so low class. The owner needs to be here to tend his business! $60 bill for a meal and service  that was mediocre at best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin...Waitress seats us a table with a dirty tablecloth.I ask for ask for a clean tablecloth and wipes the dirty one off. Iced tea was old and sour, salads came, no bread or ground pepper for 15 minutes 35 minutes later entrees show up.   my wifes meal was all wrong. Lasagna was filled with some form of ground meat. New owner came over, I told him he made an error buying into this faling dump.   Would not eat here again in you paid me"}
{"text":"The food is great!  Very tasty. The service however, was slow. It took a long time to get our drinks and food. Both of our entrees were a little cold.  The place is small with an adequate amount of servers so I don't understand the slow service and cold meals. Also this is our second time there and they were out of Peroni.  Our first time they were completely out of wine???  The food is authentic and delicious but I'm not sure if that makes up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Small authentic hole in the wall Italian restaurant. My husband always chooses to go here on date nights. Everything from sauces  to pastas all made from scratch in house. Bread given before meals is to die for. However, if you come late you may not get your pick of food. We've been here a time or two when they have ran out of chicken and marinara sauce but hey, that's what happens when everything is handmade from scratch with a lot of time put into it. Has never disappointed! Would be nice to either change pricing or portion sizes. They portions are definitely smaller. Especially their ravioli, im always still a little hungry after. But the quality of food is amazing."}
{"text":"This place says it's open till 9pm, the waitress started by telling us all the things that were unavailable on the menu. We got here at 7:45 and ordered bruschetta to start,the waitress said the kitchen was closing so she would \"see if they could make it\", she said yes, but they would have to cut everything up from scratch. Um okay. They started putting up the chairs around us, it's now 8:20 mind you they close at 9, another couple came in and were told the kitchen was closed that the only thing they could have was pizza. Bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience. No chef but supposedly the pasta was fresh?! Hmmm... freshly microwaved chicken parm and not tasty at all.. and I'm really not that picky of an eater but this was gross. We talked about how Gordon Ramsey would throw it across the room into the garbage can it was that bad.  Then had to deal with a RUDE manager.  Do NOT recommend this place to anyone. They lost my future business.  What a shame"}
{"text":"Must try this restaurant - by far the Best Italian food in Mesa - nice to have quaint little place to escape where the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch cheese ravioli, and it was very good.  I thought the service was very good as well.  I think the location of this place is kinda random.  It's a really nice, very small restaurant in a shopping center with a Dunkin Donuts, Michaels, Port of Subs, Petco, Home Depot, etc.  I expected it to be casual, however it's actually pretty fancy.  What bugged me is when we walked in for lunch (around 1pm) on a Sunday, they were not offering their lunch menu, only dinner.  I thought that was weird. The prices on the dinner menu is outrageous for a lunch.  Fortunately the waitress was super sweet and still gave us ravioli at the lunch price.  Also, if you check in, you get a $10 off anytime coupon."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant right after they opened. The menu had some great selections. I tried the orechetti dish, it was really good, Husband tried the fusilli dish, He loved it. I could not wait to try them again. I was thinking about the lasagna, or the eggplant parm.  The reason I am giving this one star this time, Husband and I wanted to go on 2/17 as we were not able to celebrate Valentines Day.  The owner asked us if we were waiting to be seated, (after we had been standing there for several minutes) We said yes we needed a table. He just stared at us than looked at the many dirty tables, He said nothing. We decided to wait at the bar. A young oriental gal fiddled with a few things than all of a sudden looked up and threw some menus down.  We stated that we were waiting for a table, and would like to order a drink while we waited.  She just snorted, looked at the manager, and mumbled \"Good Luck\".  We looked at the menu, they had 3 pasta choices very limited menu, and lots Pizza choices. We  got up and walked out, after waiting for about a half hour. We will not be back.  The staff was very Rude."}
{"text":"Northeast Mesa has its own little neighborhood Italian restaurant and we're glad for it. Red and white checkered tablecloths, Italian background music, some Italian garlic bread, a tomato caprese salad, and a bottle of Chianti. Their award winning wood fired pizza will have to wait for our next visit.  Tonight we had two traditional entree's, chicken parmigiana and fruiti di Mare fra diablo style.  

The place was quaint and clean. The food was fresh. The staff was courteous. Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out! The bread is the best part! I had the eggplant parm with spaghetti and my fianc√© had the homemade pasta with shrimp. Everything was great and we will def be back."}
{"text":"Food is as good as it can get! I ordered their Exotica pizza and my tastebuds went all the way to Flavortown. I have been there many times and I can not get enough. Their pasta dishes are exquisite. The customer service has drastically improved with new waiters and staff. Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Best calamari I've ever had! Full calamari cut perfectly served with an amazing marinara. Their pizza is fantastic and made with fresh cheese. I always ask for extra marinara and I use it at home with spaghetti.  I can't find a place that can beat their Italian food so I drive 30 minutes from Tempe every time I want real pizza and calamari."}
{"text":"I've been here before, shortly after it opened, and went back again recently.  Both times I've ordered the pizza, and I was slightly surprised to find the pizza was different than I remembered.  It was really good - love the thin crust and wood-fired taste, and their lunch price wasn't bad (although beware, the yelp coupon that pops up upon checking in is from the previous owner, and no longer honored).  Which leads us into why the pizza was probably different - the server informed me that the business is under new ownership (I don't know how new, I didn't ask, just sometime since I went last in mid-2013)  So if it's been a while since you've been here, I suggest giving it another try.  I hope they do well, it just seems like they don't do much marketing - I wouldn't know this place was there if I didn't drive by it all the time."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance,  the constant loop of Frank Sinatra is a bit irritating after awhile though. Ordered the linguini mussels,  chicken ravioli,  kids penne pasta with meatball and the parpadelle. Everything tasted excellent but don't expect to pay less then $20 per person, not much on the below $15 except the appetizers. The take out menu has more options then the eat in menu which was disappointing"}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday night, it was 5:00 PM, we were the only people in the place. There were 10 of us, didn't think that would be a problem for most restaurants,especially since no one else was there. It took 1 hour before the first person was served their dinner... YES 1 HOUR..... then the food came out about every 10 or 15 minutes. We all finally had our dinner EXCEPT one person...... it took another 15 minuets before he got his food. By that time most people were finished eating. In all it took 1 hour and 45 minutes from the time we ordered,,, until the last person got their food....the food is just average ."}
{"text":"Wow, we were completely surprised at the excellent food. Delicious sauces on homemade pasta, warm from the oven garlic bread and amazing cheesecake. We will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"My wife and I just came back from Il Forno. The service was great and the food better. The portions were very large and we did not realize we could split the portions for a $4.00 charge. Very reasonable

We will definiely be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a little plaza but one of those places that is a hidden treasure! My sister told me about it so we went to have a glass of wine and a pizza and it was amazing! It's super cute and home style Italian looking! It reminded me of an Italian restaurant I used to love in Chicago! The cheese and bread  is home made and delicious! The pizza was awesome and I can't wait to go Back to try the pasta and everything else!"}
{"text":"Entering for dinner. Hostess / server, \"sit where you like\", Us...uh every open table is dirty and needs to be bussed, they all had dishes on them. 

Once seated, we got lucky and had a good server. 2/3 of the other restaurant wasn't so lucky. They only had one good server. Service has always been a struggle here. 

We had a pizza which was pretty good. $7 for a dinner salad is a bit steep. This place has been here a few years, you would think the kinks have been worked out. 

Food was delivered hot and without a long wait. Others weren't that lucky. Again, it's the servers. 

Parking is good in the evening. Day time, it's tight."}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I visited since I've moved to Mesa. We weren't expecting it to be quite as fancy, but the ambiance truly created a nice, serene atmosphere- perfect for a date night.

The prices are relative to most nice sit-down restaurants. Not prices you'd find at any chains in the area (Chili's, etc.), but definitely not food you could find anywhere else either. The food was amazing. We had absolutely no complaints, the pizza was one of the best I've ever had. You could truly tell that the chef/owner really made this restaurant his baby- he makes all the dough, mozzarella, pasta, everything. The service was great, the food was quick, and the restaurant was not busy at all. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone in search of quality Italian food."}
{"text":"First of all, i have got to say i was really impressed with the inside view of the IL Forno restaurant. I came out here a month ago and had dinner here with a friend and his cousins for dinner. It was a really small and quiet amount of people here on a Saturday night. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball dish which was a little bland. The italian bread was really good as the staff served us before our dinner was served. The restaurant is really small with a good outside view of Michaels and several other businesses outside the strip mall. Restaurants meets right by highway 60. Great place to come and dine or hang out with friends. Will be back again when i have the chance again."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and tastes like canned pasta. The only thing edible was the bread and bottles beers. I spent 54 dollars on what tastes like a frozen pizza and spaghettios   Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"We found the pizza mediocre and ate only 2 slices. The waitress gave us credit for it, so we have to thank them. The Chicken Parm was okay. Nothing special there."}
{"text":"Did carry out and everything was great. Fantastic pizza and pasta. Lobster ravioli was a pleasant suprise with fresh, delicious sauce. Kids liked pizza as well as adults. Pizza ranks up there with Bianco's. Great to find this place in Mesa."}
{"text":"Our server, Mayra, was very sweet but no one had an apology or an explanation for us having to wait 1 hour for our meal.  We waited 25 minutes someone to bring us water or take our order.  The food was good but that might be because we were starving by the time it arrived."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to express my opinion about this restaurant and the Holiday took over.  My husband and I along with another couple decided to finally try Il Forno before the Holidays.  We will never return!  Who owns this place?  OR Who manages this place?  because clearly the evening that we dined was being managed by the staff.   Our server was awful.  Why do the servers make the drinks?  She had no clue about any liquor choice.  We were seated next to a table that was a mess.  The floor was covered in food, the table wasn't cleared until we were leaving. (1 hour).  In fact all the empty tables were left dirty and unattended.  Not one on staff smiled.  The food was good, but the service was the worst.  Needs New Management!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner again last night.  Good food -- Caesar salad and a large specialty pizza.  But I still have a beef about the wines.  The management should do something about this -- the wines are all improperly stored -- out in the open without a wine cooler present.  Last night's bottle of wine was poured and it was warm like luke warm tea.  And it was on the verge of going bad from the heat.  I assume this restaurant has a reefer -- it would be better to store the wines in the reefer and then instruct customers that they need to let the (red) wines come up to room temp before drinking them.  This would be much better than storing the wines out in the open, with the AC off during the hours the restaurant is closed, and the temps rising to 120-140 degrees inside the bldg."}
{"text":"Everyone else has been DONE with their food for several minutes, and I'm still waiting for my pasta! How long does it take to boil some noodles?? My kids are so done and dying to go, and we have to keep explaining to them that I don't have my food yet...

The food was good, but we won't be running back here..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The homemade ravioli is delicious! The homemade sausage and mozzarella are wonderful. Last time we had good wood oven baked pizza. Had to come back for the homemade ravioli and it did not disappoint!  Wonderful Mediterranean salad."}
{"text":"Tasty, friendly neighborhood spot, yet a little odd. The decor doesn't know quite what it wants to be: sports bar showing NHL and FIFA on flat-screens , or Italian Ristorante playing a classic soundtrack by Sinatra overhead. The menu is sparse, but flavorful. They make their own mozzarella for their pizzas and have a delicious fire-baked crust. The Lasagne was sweet and meaty. The service is friendly and helpful. The prices are reasonable for the freshness of the ingredients and quality, but you'll pay almost double the cost of a meal at the Chili's in the same strip. It's worth it to support a local business trying to get off the ground."}
{"text":"The food was ok (had bruschetta and the limoncello cake) however, their hours state that they are open until 9 but they close the kitchen at 8 and started putting chairs up at 7:30. One couple walked in thinking they could order dinner and had to leave. Pretty poor business practice for a restaurant. If you want to close earlier, change your hours."}
{"text":"First I'd just like to mention that they do not accept the check-in offer any more. Apparently, this offer was from the previous owner. They really need to remove this offer from yelp because it is quite deceiving. Now on to the food; we ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni/sausage & 1/2 chicken/mushroom. The crust was crispy on some pieces & soggy on others. The sauce was a bit bland, it really could use some flavor. The chicken also didn't taste that great. My husband said the pepperoni/sausage was just meh. Overall we didn't really enjoy the pizza. It was pricey & the quality was not that great. So if I were you i'd skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Meh. Slow and rather awkward service. Very, very bland food. Marinara sauce had zero flavor. Annoying background music."}
{"text":"I have had pizza all over the valley and would rather have IL Forno Italian Restaurant pizza than any of them. I always eat it there, perfect thin crust with perfect imported pepperoni  and sausage, just like the Chef Georgino's  family does in their restaurant in Palermo. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderfully delicious!  I've been wanting to try this place since they opened, but in looking at their menu online, they seemed a bit pricey which had me nervous we would pay quite a bit for a mediocre meal based on some of the reviews.  With today being Small Business Saturday, we took advantage of the AmEx promotion and the fact that they participate in the Southwest Rewards Dining program, and gave it a shot.  We went for lunch at 3PM (yes, I'm weird - I eat lunch at 3 on most days!).

I am so glad we did!  Neither my husband nor I are huge eaters at one sitting, so we agreed beforehand that we'd split an entree there and order a pizza to go for dinner tonight (yes, I need a break from turkey - it's back to turkey soup tomorrow!).  It took us forever to agree on an entree, but our server Patty was super patient and friendly. She promptly brought us drinks and yummy bread - okay it's the fault of the bread and balsamic/olive oil (and all the delicious aromas in the air!)  that it took me forever to decide as I couldn't concentrate on the menu!

We finally agreed on lobster ravioli as our entree and the salami picante pizza with added olives and jalapenos as our dinner to go.  Our entree came out in about 10 minutes and my first thought was yikes - we're splitting this little bit of food?  Then, we tore into the deliciousness!  Perfection - good chunks of lobster and the vodka cream sauce was amazing.  We were stuffed!

Then Patty brought out our pizza to go and showed it to us to make sure it was correct - we both started drooling on the spot, but give us credit please - we did make it the 1/2 mile home and inside the front door before we agreed that we each needed \"just a bite\" to try it hot and fresh - it tasted even better than it looked and smelled, if such a thing is possible.

We've been home a few hours now - alternating between napping off all that deliciousness and having \"just another bite\" of pizza heaven... now I need to figure out what's for dinner!

Glad we finally made it into Il Forno!  Patty was very friendly and efficient and the food was ahhhhhmazing!  We shall be back!  (And we also got their take out and delivery menu - delivery is $1/mile which is a bargain!)

Only negative - would have been nice to enjoy the patio today and eat outside (and escape all those mouthwatering aromas that had my stomach growling as soon as we walked in!) but that option was not available.  I'm guessing after reading more reviews before posting this that it was some of the negative ones that caused them to do away with that option - boo-hiss!

Adding ~ looked at the survey questions before posting and regarding dress code - we went in mid-day after local shopping and were casual - jeans/sweater/boots for me and shorts/tee/sneakers for my husband.  I felt comfortable, but probably would want to dress up a little nicer in the evening - so I answered \"not sure\" for that one."}
{"text":"A little gem in NE Mesa.  Fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzarella (you rarely find a place that uses fresh Mozzarella).  Service was top notch.  We went on a Friday night with a large party and we were seated in less than 10 minutes with warm bread with olive oil and balsamic arrived before we could settle in.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok people get it together either you deliver or you don't as my previous reviews state the pizzas are one of the best in the east valley but god dang it every time I want a delivery there not delivering this night for some reason or that night for another reason ..... Either you deliver or you don't"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the spagetti was ok. Nice place very clean."}
{"text":"Seriously, the worst food experience ever. Easily the worst pizza in 30 yrs of eating pizza. Zero taste. No cheese, sauce, or pepperoni. Crust had zero taste as well. Chinese buffet pizza is much better. Pizza 0/10. Calamari was at least somewhat edible. Maybe 4/10.  Also, would not honor $10 yelp discount, which I could not care less. They stated it was not posted by them. Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza we have ever had & we are from NYC!

This place is underrated! I'm a pizza connoisseur, particularly around thin crust pizzas.  The pizza came out and was cooked evenly: perfection!  I've been to John's on Bleecker, Frank Pepes, Grimaldi's, Patsy's & il Bacio etc.  This place surpassed them all.  The owner makes his own mozzarella by hand and puts it on every single pie and it really makes a difference. The sauce was delicious and tasty.

The Lemoncello Cake was amongst the finest I've had.  And equivalent to a Michelin rated restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the best Italian food we have had in the valley. The raviolis were perfect. The bruschetta was very fresh and tasted amazing. The wood fired pizza had the perfect burn on the crust to give it a wonderful taste and texture. Atmosphere was nice and staff was very attentive. Prices were reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another mom and pop that you want to be something to rave about but it only meets you half way. That half was the food, I wish I could have just tipped the chef! Everything was delicious, a little steep in the price but it was delicious. 

The service was horrible. It took 10 minutes for our drinks. At this point the staff out numbered the patrons so there was no reason for that. Then all the bad service attributes- didn't come to check if we were doing okay or if we needed anything. Our salad didn't have dressing on it, and we ended up just getting a to-go box for it because by the time she acknowledged us again we completed the rest of the meal. 

My suggestion, go eat there and maybe it will be different, or order to go!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I used to frequent this place all the time, but they have definitely gone downhill quickly (maybe new management?). The food is amazing and everything is homemade which makes all the difference! We attempted to stop in for lunch on Friday, June 5th around 11:30 am and found the door locked. A lady came out and explained the cook was running late and they wouldn't open till 12:30 or so. Ok, I can get over that- stuff happens. But then we tried to go again on Thursday, June 11th and was surprised to find yet another locked door! I called the business as we couldn't see anyone in the restaurant. A lady answered and explained the owner lives far away and had to check on his other restaurant so they'd be opening late again. In my opinion, they should just change their hours and quit making me waste my time! I will definitely not be trying again."}
{"text":"A group of 4 (2 from out of town) tried to eat here but they were closed. Hours stated they should be open (we went at 4 in the afternoon) but the doors were locked with no note."}
{"text":"I gave them a 2 star because I feel it's overpriced and the service was just barely adequate. We mentioned it was our first time here,was never offered refills until we asked and got our check,never was asked about our meal-food was ok. Everything is alacarte -I felt it was pricey for what you received-won't be back sorry"}
{"text":"Pizza has a wonderful wood fired crust; perfect base for fresh and delicious toppings."}
{"text":"We decided ti try this restaurant because it's nearby and looks nice. What a nice addition to the neighborhood. We went on a Saturday night and it was full but not crowded. Our service was excellent, a bit slow on a couple things but the food was well worth the wait. My husband had veal parmigiana which was quite delicious, served with a side of spaghetti. The sauce was light and very good. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio that was just wonderful and chose the spinach ravioli for my main dish. The ravioli was very tasty and the sauce on top was delicious. The garlic bread was really good and wonderful straught out of the oven. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and we met Peter, the owner when he walked around greeting everyone at the tables. My husband is Italian and picky about his Italian food and he can't wait to go back and try the wood fired piza. Our waitress was Sasha a sweet young lady who was very hepful and made us want to come again. Lucky for us it is right around the corner from our house so I'm sure we will go there often. Best of luck to them!"}
{"text":"The service was casually formal which was a nice change from too much attention.  The wood fired pizza was crunchy around the edges and had GREAT Italian seasoning even on the Hawaiian.  The Fruitti DE Mare was delicious with a white wine sauce. None of seafood was overcooked as is so common lately. Will go back again and see what other great dishes they have!"}
{"text":"The prices do not match the quality or portions of the food served. Poor customer service. My 99 year old neighbour purchased a 100.00 gift certificate for someone for Christmas. Months later the couple that received the gift certificate went to the restaurant to use their 100.00 gift certificate. When the bill came and when trying to use the gift certificate they were told \"those expire in two months after purchase. \" It did say that on the gift certificate in minuscule writing. Once my neighbour told me what happened I thought it would be worth a try to go there and talk to the manager. They basically said tough luck and screw you. I think that's intentional on the restaurants behalf to get something for nothing. Reading a lot of other reviews of this place I'm surprised they are still in business. Maybe they sell a lot of gift certificates knowing most likely that was free money just handed to them. I would not recommend their food, their service, or supporting them based on their lack of values."}
{"text":"Best marinara sauce my son has found.  \"No
Chunks\".  Actually handmade.  Same with meatballs.  It's a secret local find.  A must try."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Best pizza in Mesa.  Very fresh high quality taste.  We ordered a pizza with tomato and basil on it and everything from crust to sause to toppings and cheese were wonderful.  Server recommended a lemon cake type desert, I can't remember what it was called, but we all thought it was the best desert we've ever had.  Very light and delicate.  Service is very friendly but can be a bit awkward at times, but I found it endearing and think it is because they are so focused on the food.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"We  drove  25  miles  from  San  Tan  Valley  to  have  lunch  at  this  place  after  reading  all  the  exciting  reviews.   When  we  got  there  at  2pm  the  \"Open\"   sign  was  on  and  the  first  thing  we  noticed  when  we  stepped  inside,  was  that  there  wasn't  a  single  guest.  A  lady  told  us   \"Sorry,   I  don't  have   a  chef,  he  didn't  show  up\".  

 This  does  not  seem  to  be  unusual  for  this  place,  they  should  rather  put  a  sign  at their door  \"Lunch  by  appointment  only\"   rather  than  \"Open  from   11am  to  9 pm\".

Wasting  our  time  and  gas.  Big  disappointment  and  very  embarrassing  for  me  since  I  was  inviting  someone."}
{"text":"First impressions are hard to look past sometimes.  Walked in and instantly our sense smell was obliterated with the smell of a wood stove.  We stood in the doorway waiting for 5 minutes with no recognition that we were there.  If not for a couple eating I would have thought they were closed.  Someone finally walked out of the kitchen but not into our view.  The other couple eating told the server we were there.  She came out and sat us while complaining that there are 2 other servers working and she doesn't know where they are.  The dishes were priced as if they should be large portions or top quality.  The portions were average size and the food was mediocre.  It took at least 5 more minutes of being done to get the server to come back to the table.  After letting her know we didn't want dessert we got the check.  So, after awful service we all had to come home and shower because we smelled like we had been sitting around a campfire.  Good luck to anyone who goes to eat here.  Be prepared to pay $15 to $20 per person and that isn't including drinks."}
{"text":"This place was good but is has really gone down hill. Food is not consistent. Over cooked salmon. The menus don't represent what is served. They say they are served with spinach and potatoes but the salmon showed up with pasta. One time we showed up at 8:40 on a Saturday night and they were closing, not one customer in the place. They say they are open until ten. We should have known then. My daughter got sick on the next visit. Skip this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday. No one came out to seat us, even though I made eye contact with a girl cleaning in the back. It seemed like they were closing at 8:30 pm even though the door said they were open until 10pm. When they finally came out to seat us, she said they might be out of bread. She returned and sure enough they were out of bread. We told her we would just leave, and she seemed surprised and told us they were about to close anyway. I mentioned that they were supposed to be open until 10 PM, but she would not respond to me. We felt they wanted to leave, anyway. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Have tried stopping in for lunch during the week a few times...no one home.  Answer we got when we called during some weekend hour when they were open from someone who \"just works here\" is that well, sometimes the owner is late and we don't open.  Not that there are people lining up at the door for this place, but how hard is it to state your opening hours and then, well, do something crazy like...be OPEN!  the service has always been marginal at best...and rarely are their other customers the times we've been, but this is horrible customer service.  If not for a ricotta-less lasagna and a coupon I bought that I need to use there, I'd never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really in the mood for an authentic Italian pizza! We stopped by on a weekday around noon, there was only 1 other couple in there. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. We ordered pizza and the girl told us that there wasn't anyone there who could make pizza until 4pm?? We got up and left."}
{"text":"We had a coupon from restaurants.com for il Forno and I'm glad we gave them a try. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and we were the only patrons, so the service was prompt, polite & professional.

We ordered a 12\" mushroom & onion pizza as an appetizer and it was honestly one of the best pies I have ever had. The wood fired hand tossed crust is light and wonderful, the sauce is perfection. This is where I will be eating pizza from now on. 

I had the Chicken Parmigiana and it was excellent, my wife had the Linguini Frutti Di Mare which she enjoyed also. The meals included a basket of warm bread that was fresh and delicious. The portions were just right and we were able to eat everything.

The atmosphere was very nice and the prices appear to reflect the quality of the food. They have beer & wine, but I am not sure about liquor. I highly recommend il Forno and will be back."}
{"text":"The food was good to very good.  Really liked the thin pizza crust.  Food was a solid 4 stars.
The wait for our food was way too long, like 30-40 minutes after we ordered.  We had a 92 year old and a 3 year old with us, and neither were able to sit patiently while waiting.  There were only two other tables occupied while we were there, but only one cook was visible (and only one waitress).  
I would go again for the food, but not with impatient people."}
{"text":"I dont know how this place is open!! No straws, no lasagna, no pizza,no Chardonay and no veal. My eggplant parmesan was bitter and tasted like dirt. Very unwelcoming server. My dinner companion ordered ravioli which was rubbery!  Beware!!"}
{"text":"I'll Forno is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat. The wood-fired pizza is just perfect. I love the thin, crispy crust with just a hint of wood char. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality.

The chef came out to greet us and it's clear he has a passion for the food. I love finding a hidden place where the food is better than most other free-standing restaurants. I've had the pizza, the pastas, and the lobster ravioli was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has remained a local favorite of ours foe several years now. The wait staff is friendly and the food is consistently yummy. Of the things on the menu, the salami pizza is a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"We went to this place for dinner.  The prices are really high but we had a coupon from restaurant dot com for $15 off $30.  The pizza was just like Grimaldi's and the lasagna was good with just a little spicy taste to it.  There looked to be maybe one Italian person working here although the staff was friendly and the service was good.  I would not go back without the coupon though because of the prices."}
{"text":"We are from St. Louis and we went on vacation to Phoenix this past summer. We went kayaking on the Salt River and when we were done, we were looking for a pizza joint nearby. We found Il Forno and thought it would be just your average pizza. This was so much more than that. Their pizza was so delicious, you could tell it was made from scratch. The sauce and toppings are all fresh, and the crust and cheese were cooked just perfectly. This was our whole family's favorite pizza we've ever had. We've been looking for a place like this in St. Louis (St. Charles County), but haven't found one so far. Coming back next time we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews here. Must be people who know the owners. We are new to the area and saw this place and figured we would try it. Over $100 with tip  for a pizza, lobster raviolis (only 5 - not enough) and 2 glasses of house Cabernet. Very mediocre at best. The pizza is not that good. Many better places cheaper around the area."}
{"text":"Just tried to have lunch here at 1140. Door hours and website hours said opens at 11am. There was someone inside standing at the counter and when I tried to get in the door was locked. The woman on the inside looked at me then hid behind the kitchen staring at me through the window! If you couldn't open or take customers when your sign said open at least acknowledge me and tell me not creepily stair at me through a window hoping I go away.  I was going to be a new customer and was excited to try out this new place.  Not only did u lose a customer but U got a bad review."}
{"text":"Really, really, really good pizza!!!! The waitress said the cheese is made there on the premises as well as the sausage. This is the best pizza I've had in a long time. We also had their bruschetta which was excellent - Seriously loaded with tomatoes. The waitress scraped the tomatoes off and put them in a separate container when she packaged the leftovers - love that special touch with service. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  Small, looks like it's family owned, nice ambience.  The hostess and waitress were friendly and accommodating.  As we were waiting for the food, the young staff kind of forgot they were running a restaurant.  They all ended up in the kitchen laughing and joking around.  A couple of the girls had long hair, and there were no hair nets in sight.  This included a teenage girl and a guy in t shirt and shorts.  The kitchen of a rest. Is no place for everyone to hang out.  We got our food, and it actually tasted great, but sure enough, we found a hair in my shrimp pasta.  No Bueno.  My wife's lobster ravioli was tasty, but needed to have a couple more to be a full meal.  End result- love the place, food tasted great, but remember you are a professional food establishment. If I could I would attach a pic of the hair, it's on my phone."}
{"text":"Just had the best pizza I've had in along time.  We had the special and ate every bite even after eating all of the fresh bake bread and salad we were served.  It is so nice to have a great place to get good pizza!"}
{"text":"The service is a little slow.  They're finding their rhythm and it's obvious some of the servers are new to this location.  Having said that their pizza is outstanding.  Easily the equal if not better than Grimaldis.  Everything was made fresh, the mozzarella, the sauce the dough and it showed.  The owner was very warm and obviously took pride in his establishment.  It may be a little rough at first but the place was packed last night and I didn't hear a single complaint.

Their deserts were out of this world.  I highly recommend the lemon-cello and the cannoli."}
{"text":"We won't be going back to this restaurant.  It took 40 minutes to get our drinks, the pizza came out before the appetizer, and the lasagna came out 20 minutes after the appetizer.  This restaurant is very poorly managed.  It is  a shame that this restaurant has terrible service, because the food is good!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch! I've been here several times and have ordered the pizza each time. Today I ordered 3 slices of pizza from their lunch special and they surprised me with a full sized pizza. My favorite is their cheese - sounds boring, but they make it soo good. Each individual flavor - the fresh cheese, homemade sauce and delicious crust, are all flavors that explode in your mouth with flavor. They also top it with fresh basil, which makes it even more delicious.  My husband ordered the calzone, which was huge and he said it was delicious. We both ordered salads which were beautifully set-up and tasted delicious. It had many different types of lettuce, and every ingredient looked fresh. We didn't try the wine list, but it looks like they have lots of options.

The restaurant is new, clean, and everything is homemade with fresh ingredients which you can taste.

My only complaint is the cost of the dinner menu. It's a bit pricey, especially for the casual atmosphere. So we stick to the lunches which are priced about right; especially the pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here some they opened they do need to change the menu and add free salad or soup, food is fantastic, service is great prices are reasonable this is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is their bottled beer. 

Husband wanted to try a different restaurant and found this one. Let's just say he's banned from picking restaurants for a while. 

Got there around 7 PM, only one other table occupied in the place. That should have been the first clue. 

Food was terrible. Bland pasta with no flavor.  My husband had the chicken parmigiana, which was also bland. The outer crust of the pizza was good, but the middle of the pizza was soggy. And unfortunately, also flavorless. 

We spent almost $80 for 2 adults and 1 child. And for being the only table in the place, we had amazingly slow service. 

Maybe it was an off night, but I suspect this place is on it's way out of business."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying il Forno and I'm happy to say that It not only met my expectations it surpassed them from the Excellent service to the Great food tonight was all around Spectacular.

I ordered a 12\" mushroom and onion pizza as an appetizer and it was hands down the best pizza I've had in A while, the wood fired hand tossed crust is light and Scrumptious, the sauce was perfection. It's safe to say i will be getting my pizza from il Forno from now on.

I had the Lobster ravioli it was honestly Amazing, my brother had the Linguini Frutti Di Mare wich he also enjoyed very much. The meals included a basket of warm fresh bread that was Delicious. 

The atmosphere was very nice, And the service was very nice I was attended quickly and respectfully The young lady who served me was Very polite and never gave us a bad tone she was very respectful we tipped her very well I very much enjoyed my first time dining at IL Forno. I Highly recommend this place and I will DEFINITELY be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Food rates a better than 3 stars but the service does not.  White wine was not cold...she brought me a glass of ice!"}
{"text":"I have dined in twice and taken out once in the past month from this restaurant. Everything from the bread and olive oil to the lobster ravioli to the Caesar salad to the pizza and cannoli are high quality and delicious. All entree items are made from scratch including the mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Terrible quality food. Prices are not competitive, neither is what's included in a meal. $15 bucks will get you a simple, subpar, disappointing bowl of pasta served on a dirty table with some tasteless bread. Worst $37 spent in a long time."}
{"text":"Been here over a hour- asked 3 times for bread- never got it! Service is awful! The young waitress has no personality and is beyond rude! We've been regulars here but not anymore! Not to mention they brought the wrong food out 5 times to our table and the table next to us. When we finally got our food- it took another 10 minutes for my husband to get his salad and it was the wrong salad! Needless to say he ate it and we left! We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We were a little early so waited until 11 anyway. We walked in and the hostess said oh I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door back. I said don't you open at 11? She replied well I don't have a cook here and I'm not sure when I will. Maybe probably an hour or so. So can't review the food but service was a joke as you can read. We won't give it another shot. Visited on Monday 5/16/2016."}
{"text":"What a surprise!!  The food here is wonderful.  I gave them five stars in spite of the fact that they are Steelers fans.  Yes, it's that good!"}
{"text":"This place was not very good at all. Maybe it was the fact that the oven was broken on 11/15/2013, a little detail the server neglected to tell us until after our drinks arrived. So we couldn't order from half the menu. Dishes run $16-$22, which I thought was a little pricey, especially considering we didn't get anything with our entrees; no bread, no soup, no salad.  

The lobster ravioli was just okay. There was some lobster, but mostly just a mix of some seafood/krab salad  made with mayonnaise stuck in a ravioli shell covered with some orange sauce. I was expecting much more. Didn't come close to the Lobster ravioli at macaroni grill. 

The Mediterranean pizza was a little better, included all the right elements, but just lacked any sort of spark to set it apart. And we both got heartburn after dinner, not sure if that was from pseudo seafood or garlic on the pizza. 

The bill for two people was around $60, not including the tip. The servers seemed understaffed, there wasn't any bussers to clean tables, so servers had to do it all. 

We wanted to support small business, but I felt like I got ripped off for what we paid. 

The competition from Red White and Brew is going to be tough to beat if this business expects to stay in business with the poor menu selection and bland flavors that we experienced. 

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We tried the pizza, sandwiches and ravioli.  All were very good!.  We loved the fresh stringy mozzarella cheese and fresh ingredients on the wood fired pizza.  The bread used for the sandwiches was fantastic! The ravioli was definitely home made without question.  It was amazing!  The food is pricey for dinner so lunch is a good option.  They do have lunch specials and the lunch prices are good.  The service was amazing!  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner.  Very pleasant and  quiet.  The service was very good and the staff very friendly and on top of everything.  The food was a good portion and very tasteful.  Definetely recommend if you are looking for quiet and good food."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  My wife had fettucine alfredo with chicken and really enjoyed it.  I had spagetti with a meat sauce and it also was very good.  But the meat sauce needed something to \"sauce\" it a little more.

What really drove me over the edge was the bread they brought us.  Awesome, made in house with an incredible garlic butter spread on the outside.  I could eat that stuff everyday!

The inside of the restaurant was nice and the music was mostly Frank Sinatra, but just before we departed it turned to Christmas music.  I still enjoyed it but it was the middle of August!

The restaurant was not busy (7 people), and the waitress was very nice.

We will go again and this time I will try the pizza."}
{"text":"First time dining at IL Forno tonight.  The complimentary bread was good. We had to ask for more because everyone at our table enjoyed it.  We ordered (2) orders of Tomato Caprese for our table of (5) people and the portions were small and not proportionate- huge pieces of cheese and small slices of tomato.  I ordered the $16 Chicken Parm which included a decent size piece of chicken and a helping of spaghetti and marinara. It was good but not great.  My wife enjoyed the $19 Parpadelle with shrimp. She rated her meal at 3.5 stars.  (2) people in our group ordered Fussilli off the \"Homemade Pasta\" section of the menu but both had to pick other pastas because they were out.  Another person in our party ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese but someone came out about 5 minutes later and said they were out of Bolognese. This was at 7pm on a Saturday.  Our server was friendly, and nothing was terrible, but given the  circumstances we had tonight, I'd rate our trip a solid 3-Star experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, server was not great. I don't know if she was new. Didn't seem like she enjoyed her job. Didn't bring bread, didn't bring our glass of wine in which we canceled that. Will try a different waiter next time."}
{"text":"So, after two carry-outs and now dining in I'm due for a review. The pizza is pretty good, thin crust, brick-oven baked. I've had the margarita and the smoked salmon. Both were quite delicious. Drink prices were quite good as well, other than the wine. But I can't say I've found a place with wine prices I've liked. When you check in at this joint Yelp is going to give you a $10 discount on your tab. But, they won't honor it, therefore they lose another star!"}
{"text":"This place is a huge disappointment, the staff was rude and the food was over priced and mediocre. I got 2 pizza's and a shrimp scampi appetizer. I wasn't acknowledged for over 10 minutes after walking in to get my order.  People who walked in after me were served with no problem.  After asking if they could help me,  like a was a homeless person walking in from the street,  I informed them of my phone order.  30 minutes later I was walking out with my food.  Completely ridiculous! The dough on the pizza was soggy and the shrimp scampi consisted of 5 small shrimps in a bowl of melted butter for $12! That's over $2 a shrimp! The Taste on the shrimp was by far the most disgusting thing I've ever put into my mouth, I've had shrimp over a hundred different ways in over 20 different states, and somehow,  they managed to make the shrimp scampi taste like it was sauteed in pickle juice with lots of garlic. I recommend people spend their money somewhere else.  This place will leave you disappointed and wishing you listened to my review."}
{"text":"We got a flyer in the mail and decided to try this place despite the one bad review from a disgruntled patron. Let me tell you I'm Italian and picky about my pizza. So if I'm going to be impressed win me over with the pizza. 
   This restaurant is on the corner of a strip mall so the outside isn't impressive. When you walk through the door your nose is immediately greeted by fresh basil and garlic. The place is well lit as there are windows on 2 sides and one wall with a full length mirror to reflect the natural light and give a roomier appearance. The d√©cor is appropriately Italian with soft Italian themed music in the background. 
    We were immediately greeted by our waitress and seated. We ordered a 12\" pizza with 2 toppings. While the pizza was being made, the waitress brought out a small complimentary order of garlic bread. Our order was out in a reasonable amount of time and our sodas were refilled. The pizza is thin crust and hand tossed baked in a wood fired oven. The sauce is freshly made with pieces of fresh basil in it. The Italian sausage topping is bursting with flavor and the cheese is freshly grated.
    After the meal we were greeted by Giorgio, the owner. He was interested in our experience as the waitress told him we were first time customers. He informed us that he makes everything fresh every day from the sauce to the pasta. He learned the secrets of Italian cooking in Italy where he grew up.
   This restaurant has gained a new patron by winning this Italian over with its authenticity and cuisine. I am looking forward to experiencing more items from the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem.  The bolognese sauce is incredible.  I will definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe how easy it was to get a table if six on a Saturday night! Our waitress was polite, helpful and met our every need. Not to be negative but I didn't expect this in Arizona. After living here six years, I was surprised to have a delicious Italian meal in the Wild West. Bravo to the owners! I had some spicy shrimp fettuccine and it was pretty good. My daughter had the salmon which was a bit overcooked but as a nine year old she didn't notice. My other two had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs and everybody was happy."}
{"text":"I went about two weeks ago. They start out with this fresh baked yummy bread. I got the chicken parm and it was amazing! My group got a caprese salad to share, amazing!, and my 6 year old got a cheese pizza. I was blown away that this pizza was made from scratch and cooked in a real wood fire oven. This pizza was so amazing! And it reheated as left overs perfectly in my toaster oven. 10/10 I recommend this place. The bar selections are excellent and plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"Pizza brought to our table had a black crust. Sauce was flavorless and minimally spread, sausage wasn't crumbled but slice - and flavorless, cheese was bland and sparse. 

Waiter should have never brought this burnt cardboard to our table.

Will not return.

We've had better pizza at Chucky Cheese."}
