{"text":"I consider myself a chicken wing fan. Most of my reviews on yelp were either chicken wing adventures, or failed chicken wing adventures, ending up at another toronto resto'. This place was one of the more pleasurable chicken wing adventures in toronto. This whole phenomenon of incredible amounts of flavors is getting old (Duffs does the flavour spectrum correct, simple yet satisfying) While Puck'n Wings isnt quite as gratuitous as wild wing in its list of flavors, most sound like they have no place on a chicken wing. After sifting through the list and settling on the most desirable sounding flavors, i waited for my order to be taken. We went on the half priced monday night half priced wings day, and with the culmination of a pretty terrible waitress, and the fact that on wing night veggies arent included, i was pretty ready to give this place a terrible Yelp rating. When the wings arrived though, my opinion was slightly swayed, as they were chubby flavorful and genuinely quite good. Theres unquestionably better places to go for chicken wings in the city, but if you happen to be in the Annex on a monday night, dont be too scared to try this corner stop, its not too bad."}
{"text":"An average bar sports bar, with decent wings if you like them saucy, which I do.  The interior is clean and comfortable, if uninspired.  The menu options are varied, but of uneven quality, except of course for their wings, which are a good value and reasonably well prepared. 

Do go here if you want good wings, beer, and sports.  Otherwise go somewhere else. Be prepared to be transported back to the 90s."}
{"text":"Chicken Wings were a bit small, but good favoring many choices.  
Fries were good.

Its a \"guy\" bar.
Lots of Big screen and nice small patio outside."}
{"text":"Watery vodka soda. As for wings, lots of 'flavor selections', but as with every other wing place i've been to in toronto so far, unbelievably expensive for what you get. 6 wings cost 10.99?!?!?! heck, i can get a whole cooked chicken for less than that. disappointing. additionally, the restrooms have had their mirrors replaced with horrid, gauche advertisement screens. i think the ostensible idea is that when you turn on the water the ad disappears and you can see yourself, but it was malfunctioning when i was there so i was forced to stare at a car ad as I washed my hands. Yeah. . . I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place serves up to 50 different wing flavours!! With so many choices, I really had a difficult time choosing but ending up going with 1 pound of BBQ Mild, Cajun and the Dry Rub Lemon Pepper Wings. They were AMAZING, and here you actually get the traditional BIG roaster wings, om nom nom. I think I found the new best wings place in the city!! Sayonara Louis Wings, Hello Puck'n Wings! They were delicious and really fresh - we got the hot new batch of chicken. They had a good texture and were really crispy even though they had sauce on them which was very impressive. The BBQ/Cajun sauces were flavourful and gooey but I found the Cajun more to my liking as it had a perfect blend of a sweet n' sour taste while the BBQ was pure sourness to me. The Lemon Pepper on the other hand was the dry rub kind and it was very tasty as they used fantastic herb flavouring (just a little bit over-salted though). Overall, the food was wonderful, and I will definitely go back to try the other 47 flavours"}
{"text":"Something is usually dirty, double check your fork. foods decent, solid wings, not much else. Staff can be a hit and miss. I've had a near perfect waitress and one that brought us our drinks 10 minutes after our food came. It's a big place and has a good vibe for sports, They also do a BS cover charge some nights, not only do they not tell you upfront, but they even charge tax on it."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the annex, I came across Puck'n Wings during a bike ride. The themed restaurant has an interesting list of 50 wing flavours. I had the dragon wings while my wife had the chicken tenders. Both were good portions. The wings were meaty and dripping in sauce. All in all a great meal at a fair price. My only wish would be that the dragon sauce be a little more spicy. Rated as a \"hot\", the dragon sauce left me wondering if all their \"hot\" sauces were on the milder side.

Maybe I'll try their suicide sauce next time."}
{"text":"The wings here are pretty good, i prefer St. Louis but I have to say this place is pretty close in terms of wing tastiness. 

Its great for a pitcher and wings if you're looking to catch the game/fight but for me, the whole place was ruined by the bartender (I think her name was Jen, can't remember. Short, chubby blonde girl, big boobs)

Service was slow, and our server (who was also the bartender) seemed to think she was gracing us with her presence. Food was on the slow side, though tolerable, but waiting for drinks was like being stuck on the 401 during rush hour. From what I could tell, she wasn't all that busy, since she seemed to be pretty engaged in conversing with her bar peeps when she was eating her dinner behind the bar. Now, normally I'm pretty laid back with stuff like that because I've worked in the service industry and I know that what you see is often not the whole story when it comes to servers/staff etc. HOWEVER, when we ordered another pitcher, she started the tap, and forgot about it. the pitcher was about 3/4 full of foam, which, instead of pouring it out, she let sit for 14 mins (yes i timed her). 14 mins later, my friend finally got up to ask her if that was our pitcher. She rolled her eyes, giggled a bit, and said \"yeah, I'll bring it up for you\". Now, not only have we been waiting for the damn thing forever, we were expected to drink the now stale beer that had been sitting there for 14 mins. My friend politely requested that she pour a new pitcher, and again, she rolled her eyes and simply stated, \"there's nothing wrong with the beer, there was just some head\". When he insisted that she pour a new pitcher, she slammed the pitcher down, huffed away picked up a new pitcher and poured the new one. All the while, rolling her eyes and tell her bar customer that we were being unreasonable. Needless to say, the customer said nothing. 

Our table was right next to the bar, which is why we were able to witness all this happening. 

We left her a 10% tip, even though we really should've left her nothing. 

BTW, you get charged for any sauces on the side. Be sure to order everything at once because you'll be done eating before you get what you asked for if you wait till you get your food. 

This place could be good but the service kills it."}
{"text":"The place is called The Puck Sports Bar and Grill now, not Puck n Wings.

I went here for the first time for some wings and beer. It happened to be half-off wings Monday! For $6 you get a pound; it usually comes with celery sticks and carrots and dip, but if you get the $6 special, you only get the wings. 
The wings were crispy and the sauces were good. They were pretty big, bigger than St. Louis, the competitor down the street. It had a few dry spots where it was too chewy, but generally, it was good. Beer is relatively cheaper here, but small selection.

We ordered the onion rings as well ($9). Pricier than other places for sure, but man, the onion rings were one of the best I had. Not overly salty which is rare, very crispy and thin batter with moist onion ringlets inside. YUM

Gotta say though, their description on the menu can be misleading and they will leave out unpleasant details or conditions, and service could be better. Our waitress just made assumptions and gave us what she thought we would like, and she just brought a different size of order than we requested without checking with us, and then ended up charging a higher price as well... I think it was an honest mistake and she was trying to be sweet, so I'll let it pass. Otherwise, I'd never come back.

Food was pretty good, so I'm still going to give the 4 stars I was going to give. They have a special every day, as you see in the pictures on Yelp. I'm most interested in the Monday and Tuesday ones."}
{"text":"This place is run by amateurs. We arrived early, just as they were opening but that is no excuse. I tried to order a specific draught beer but the line was supposedly frozen.  I told the nice server/waitress #1 that I would wait the 10 minutes... but after 20 minutes still my beer choice would not pour.  So I ordered second choice and was told that line was frozen too!  My friend suggested something different. I wasn't pleased.  For my second pint I tried ordering the preferred brand (after watching them pour one for the stranger next to me).  Again there was a problem and again (a different bartender this time) #2 asked me to choose something else.  I had not even taken a sip from the glass when they fix whatever was wrong and  #3 starts pouring for someone else, the beer brand I had ordered. I asked the #3 to trade my beer and rather than capitalize on an opportunity to make good on a bad situation knowing that I have been inconvenienced twice already, he makes some excuse and says \"how am I going to recoup the cost of the one in front of you?\"  Maybe because I would have come back and bought a few more had I been happy with your service.

Onto the food. The pound of wings was pretty good. My buddy ordered Island spice which tasted somewhat like jerk, and I had the dry cajun.  Wings are a good size and cooked right. Very juicy and tastey.  The side of fries was pretty expensive and I figure for the prices they charge, fries should have been included. 

We were asked to settle before we were ready because a third person joined the group and that confused the heck out of the #2 bartender (he may quite possibly be the owner).. The waitress #1  that had initially started serving us apologized for the confusion and it is obvious the issue was with server #2.  Seems she was fixing a lot of their mistakes that afternoon. Eventually they got the bills right and we settled up. We were asked to pay as we ordered from that point; but instead we called it a day. Had they let us continue to run the tab on the credit card, we may have stayed for another pint or two.

I can't even defend them by saying that they weren't expecting it to be busy, because really, who wouldn't expect a sports bar to be busy on a Canada vs USA Olympic hockey day?

Not sure what the other locations are like, but I probably won't give them a chance."}
{"text":"I've been to Puck'n Wings a few times and I've had mostly great experiences. I love that there are many tvs, a real sports bar. It attracts hardcore game watchers including some solo eaters at the bar. We like the wing flavors, which range from 1-5 in hotness, the hotter ones 4 & 5 are decently hot compared to most places hot wings we've had in the area (which isn't saying much if you're into super hot foods) They're hotter than the wings at Crown & Dragon and hotter than Superhot at Duffs.

I don't think Puck'n Wings deserves the top spots on all of the hot wing recognition lists I've seen around the internet and papers but they're a decent wing for what I've tried in Toronto, and possibly the best in the Annex."}
{"text":"Their dry spice Island Heat ,Thai chili wings and sweet potato fries were alright. Just based on those it would have been 3.5 star,

However, their Ginger Soya wings was disgusting. Shouldn't be on the menu. It was obviously an off-the-shelf  Chinese black bean sauce they used. 

Another thing is please get a at least a cold glass for beer. It's inexcusable with a bar of your size, there weren't even that many customers.

Everything would have still been 3 star until when paying the bill. The waitress invited herself to sit down and basically try to get us to tip more. I hope she reads this and learn that not all their customers would appreciate this type of \"service\". It just made the whole experience cheap.

1 pound wings ($12) + 1/3 pitcher ($6) + 1/3 fries ($6) costed us each $25 +tax + tips on a Thursday night. Monday night is half priced for wings though. Otherwise, totally overpriced, Wild Wings close by would have been $15 with pitcher + 1 lb wings on Thurs night. Bad decision on our part.

This area is highly competitive, I hope the business will learn that and improve upon it. 

-1 star for service
-1 star for price given the quality

Never again."}
{"text":"Poor beer selection but the wings are pretty good and they have a large selection.  The decor is boring with lots of TVs around.   The staff were friendly.   Not a bad place but nothing really saying that I need to go back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday around dinner time. I was surprised that it was almost empty save for a couple other parties, but perhaps it was because it was reading week (seems like a university hang-out) and people probably go there later at night or when a game is actually playing.

I ordered the wings and fries meal. I loved that they had so many flavours to choose from! I got spicy ranch and thought it was great. Just spicy enough. The wings themselves were delicious and the meat was tender. Another cool thing was they had the option of curly fries! I hadn't had those since high school so obviously jumped on the chance the try them again. 

They serve you water in these giant glasses which I at first thought was ridiculous but could be helpful if you order super hot wings and are fiending for water every 20 seconds. 

I thought the service could have been faster considering we were one of three tables in the joint and how long does it really take to deep fry wings and fries?

I would probably go to Wild Wing or Duff's Wings over this place next time, but I don't remember seeing curly fries on their menus, so we'll see.."}
{"text":"Ordered ribs. Parts of it cold upon arrival. Not enough BBQ sauce.
Ordered sweet potato fries as a side. Soggy.
Ordered coleslaw on the side. Did not resemble coleslaw.
Decent service; will not revisit."}
{"text":"Beer is warm. Wings arnt good. Deep dish pizza isn't. To bad because set up is very nice."}

the wings were meaty and crispy
service was great"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Chicken Wings and have explored many places in Toronto for delicious wings and something where I can get away from the standard levels of spicy BBQ sauces.  Puck'n Wings is the place to go if you want to explore various wing flavours.  There are over 50 selections, and the wings have never been dry or stingy with the meat on the bone.

The best time to go would be Monday's when its half price wings with a purchase of a drink.  I recommend going with a at least a few people then you can share a variety of different flavours.  If you decide to get a soft drink get ready for it to be the size of Movie theatre glass.  They definitely don't go stingy with  their soft drinks, that's for sure.  Also, the curly fries are really tastey with a great side dip.

The service is pretty friendly, and if you're into sports they have them playing on the TV screens throughout the restaurant.  Also, from what I hear for you guys out there, supposedly, the urinals have little hockey nets and pucks for you to play with while peeing.  In my opinion though, if you're peeing that much to be able to play that, you probably had waaay to much to drink. haha!"}
{"text":"For a sports bar, this place is alright. Every television was showing hockey, except one, which was showing basketball. The music wasn't too loud. Because of the location, the crowd is your basic early-20s college types. 

A friend and I went here to escape the weather on a snowy / rainy night and the floors were incredibly slippery--I almost wiped out a few times. They kept sprinkling a strange powder around in an effort to maintain traction, I suppose, but it wasn't helping.

We ordered a pitcher of beer and were confused by the menu. There are so many gate-folds and arbitrary titles and sections for everything. Can't they just say \"Wings\" and \"Fries\" etc? In any case, we ordered two pounds of wings--the Maple BBQ and the Pineapple Curry with ranch dip. They arrived large and oozing sauce, with a handful of celery and carrot sticks on the side. The Maple BBQ was delicious as all hell. The Pineapple Curry was less great, but still alright. The smell of the pineapple curry lingered forever, and I had to keep washing and washing my hands to get it off.

Overall, a disorganized and boring spot to go. But if you do get stuck here because of the weather, get the Maple BBQ wings and a beer and wait it out."}
{"text":"This place is great for watching almost any sports game, they have TV's in every angle and all around you. They will switch channels upon request.

Washrooms are clean and service is fast.

Everything I have eaten here has been flavourful although options for vegetarians are fairly limited and they have a limited selection of beers for you to choose from.

I used to live fairly close to this place and went here a few times, but it is not a place that I would drive out of my way to go to.

This is a sports bar with great appetizers, if you live in the area, I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Ended up here after a string of closed/full bars for a friends birthday party, mostly out of desperation for beer.  The atmosphere can best be described as \"Milton\" or \"Mississauga.\"  Think every Jack Astor's you've seen, except with wings.

Beer selection was your usual middle of the road beers, don't expect any surprises there, except for Labatt 50 on tap, which keeps popping up in the oddest places.

I was disappointed with my wing choice (pepper supreme), mainly because they were rated a 3 for \"hot\", but didn't even approach \"sightly warming my mouth\".

To their credit, we did descend unexpectedly with crew of 15, and the serving staff did an admirable job of handling it.

Overall, it's an odd fit for an area that has seen it's ups and downs bar wise.  I'd keep looking."}
{"text":"The food there is disgusting. Ordered nachos, they used cheese whiz as the cheese on the nachos. Chips were obviously soggy and used some sort of bean paste as a topping. Basically looked like someone puked on the nacho chips. Service was nothing special.  Would not go back there again."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill for the last 2 yrs. I used to come here all the time for their curly fries, fried calamari and variety of wings. 

Last Monday I ordered butter chicken wings with curly fries. The order showed up ( later than usual) with regular fries and the worst concept of a butter chicken I have ever eaten. It was basically tomato paste from the can heated with some curry powder. Not cooked but heated. I could taste the rawness of both ingredients it was awful.  Plus when asked about the curly fries they informed they ran out!!!! My only consolation was that the wings are half price on Mondays, if I had to pay full price for the crap I got I would be super mad."}

I love chicken wings....that's why I have them at least once every week, usually at my favorite wing spot- St Louis Wings & Ribs. But I am always willing to try other locations, since there are so many chicken wing places in Toronto, I might as well give them a try! 

One day I decided to follow my friends to their favorite chicken wing spot, Puck N Wings. I've passed by this location many times but it's sort of far from where I live. So due to convenience, I never bothered to try it until this decided to take me.

Inside of the restaurant is pretty casual, just like any other pub or sports bar. It's laid back with lots of random sporting gear displayed everywhere and TV hanging off the wall. Given the fact that I am not a crazy fan of any sport.....food matters the most for me!

They have very extensive menu even besides wings. I didn't really bother looking at other items since this was a chicken wing spot. But even for chicken wings..they offer lots of flavors you can choose from. I left the ordering to my friends since I wasn't sure what was good here.

For some reason, I didn't want to drink that day (excuse me!?) so I decided to order a sprite. The drinks are huge, they were almost twice the size of iphones! They are $2.99 each with free refill.

Ordered: Caesar Salad with bacon 3/5

* This came in a huge bowl for $8.99
* Even if you were having this for a meal, it would be very big in portion
* Like every other restaurant served caesar salad, it was drenched with dressing (fattening but so delicious)
* It was a little too rich and heavy to be eaten with chicken wings and fries 

We ordered 3 different flavors of wings and they are all served with carrot and celery sticks. You have to order fries as a side if you wish (St. Louis serves their wings with side of fries but no veggie). I was almost shocked to see how big their chicken wings were. They were almost twice the size of regular chicken wings.

Ordered: Cajun Dry Rub 4/5

* Overall a mild flavor (almost taste just like salt + pepper)
* Around 5~6 wings 
* Served with ranch sauce

Ordered: BBQ Medium 3/5

* Very strong sauce
* Sour BBQ sauce (the type that goes up your nose)
* Wings are very meaty

Ordered: Creole 5/5

* This was one of the new flavors I've tried
* Tasted just like honey mustard sauce but light
* Sweet mustard with hint of creaminess
* Probably my favorite one out of all

Ordered: French fries (blade fries) 5/5

* Side order for $4.99
* Ordered them extra crispy
* Served with creole sauce (honey mustard)
* Crunchy through out

Ordered: Curly fries (skate lace fries) 4/5

* Side order for $4.99
* Big portion for a side but overall kind of pricey for side order of fries

Summary: I really enjoyed chicken wings from Puck n Wings. But maybe I got too used to half price wings at St.Louis Wings I just don't like paying more than $10 for wings AND fries. Also, I prefer St.Louis because they give you fries for free with a order of chicken wings where at Puck n Wings...you have to pay $4.99 to order them as a side. I wouldn't mind going back if I was in the area with friends- but if I just wanted chicken wings, I am sticking to my all time favorite, St.Louis!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this place twice but I'm pleased by how good the food is here. The curly fries are fun finger food and the wings were very appetizing even though my choice of flavour was pretty generic, nothing too crazy (I'm a lightweight when it comes to spicy food). The cake is very good also. I recommend the red velvet or fudge the most, especially heated!
The prices are a little hefty so I only come here if I absolutely need to treat myself. Also the wait times weren't ideal, perhaps if it was a little less of a busy night, it would be better so it's no one's fault really. 
Great location also. Very fun decor and very close to Finch Station."}
{"text":"Hands down, this place has the best wings in Toronto! 

Of the 50-flavors to choose from, my all time favorites are: 
1. Butter Chicken 
2. Creamy Parm
3. Maple Garlic

Each flavor is unique and the chicken wings they use could possibly be on steroids, but seriously so juicy and delicious. The size of each wing is also larger than average. Irregardless of the zesty flavors offered, their juicy chicken wings are the biggest selling point why people would come back. The sweet potato fries are also amazing! 

If you're feeling for something healthier, they have a build-your-own-salad menu that's pretty awesome for women on strict diets coming here to watch a ball game or UFC with their significant other. 

Only reason why they don't have a five-star is due to their lack of service. On numerous visits, our waitress would take our order and disappear till the food is ready, as if they were the ones cooking. You may also feel neglected standing by the door because they take some time to seat you. Their problem can be easily solved by hiring more staff. 

They are also easily accessible - just a few steps from Finch Subway Station! There's also a nice patio during the summer, and parking in the back! 

Two-Thumbs Up! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite wings place so far!

I came here on a Monday night, which is also their wing night (50% off a pound or two with a large drink) and it's near University of Toronto so it's mostly packed with students. Me and my friend got seated immediately, ordered, and wings came in a reasonable time.

WINGS ARE SO JUICY AND CRISPY OMG... I had like a food orgy in my mouth. (Not sure if I can say this on Yelp? Lol...) The wings are pretty big and not over-drenched in sauce.

Okay sure, our waitress didn't give a crap about us and rarely came by to check on us but hey, it's $6 chicken wings so I couldn't care less. (Ahem, she came by like once and ask us how everything was and walked off before she even finished her sentence lol)"}
{"text":"First time coming after living in the area for more than 6 years.. 

We were searching for a good Caesar place and ended up here. The Caesar came with 3 wings and onion rings - very generous for $10. The sauce for the wings was actually one of the best I've had. I forgot the name though... Also had curly fries and it was good. Nothing special, nothing new. 

Service was good and quick!"}
{"text":"its the average bar, their burgers are average, almost kind of bland in my opinion, the service is kind of crappy, one time i actually sat down and did not get served for maybe 15 minutes so i got up and left, i could not lcoate the waitress

the decor needs updating, alot of the tables and seating looks brutally scratched"}
{"text":"Came for the wings, all I can say is horrible!

-wings tasted old & frozen for months 
-smell like crap
-brown and black on the inside 
-med & hot BBQ taste more like vinegar 

Although the waitress was friendly it was Very dissapointing wings!"}
{"text":"Advice : Stop using skip the dishes Puck N Wings. 
If I eat at your establishment, everything goes well. 
For whatever the reason, whenever I use skip the dishes to order the same food, it takes two hours, including 45 minutes for the restaurant to confirm the order because the place is too busy, the food comes cold, and without napkins or cutlery or any care. Also, the last order I did of two pounds of wings was barely one pound. 
I should know. 
I am a fat guy who has eaten a lot of wings. 
Your wings. 
I know what two pounds looks like, and I know how they look like at your restaurant. 
Last night I waited two hours to get wings I threw out. 
The cheesecake again, no care. Just thrown in a plastic casing broken in half with no whip cream added like it is when in the restaurant. 
I am not proud to be fat from eating wings and cheesecake, but I say it because I know my food. 
And if I am going to kill myself eating fatty food, can I at least enjoy it l? and not die from the stress of wasting time with bad service on top of the fatty cold useless delivered food I paid for. 
If you do not gel with skip the dishes or any take out service, do not use them because it completely effects your public perception. 
Something a restaurant wants a positive review of right? 
So eat in at Puck and Wings. 
Yes. 
Great food. 
Order with Skip the Dishes,  NO!!! 
Sorry to sound like a Donald Trump tweet with the cap letters, but you guys look really bad every time I have tried to order in from Puck N Wings. 
So I will not do it again. 
I am also out $50 plus dollars for the order not eating anything last night, because the food was the wrong portion and cold. 
Maybe you did me a favour to help me loose a pound or two, but I am not paying for that service. 
In the end it's just the luxury of eating some good tasting wings and a desert, but I really do not want to pay to be treated like garbage instead of a loyal customer.
Oh I lied about one thing. 
I drank the two dollar can of Coke that was in the order. Somehow that was not messed up in this order. Came with the opening tab for the can and everything."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night and I am giving it an extra star as I found out most, if not all establishments do charge a cover for UFC events. And, it appears that this location might charge the least cover which is okay I guess. 

Wings are actually very good here and that is why we came here with a group of friends yesterday. It was extremely quiet for a Saturday night (no event) which makes it a great hang out place for a group if you just want to chill."}

If you live in the neighborhood & want a place to chill & watch a game or something- I definitely recommend this place."}

{"text":"Now known as \"Pucks\" 

Went there for lunch with work colleagues, we easily waited for 45mins/1hour for our lunches. Half the tables were still dirty - needed to be bussed, the only waitress was running around doing her best, while the manager wasn't really doing much. No one ever came to check on us. Very disappointing on a whole. 

Over all the service, quality of food and overall experience sucked. The only reason I'm giving them a star is that we 'eventually' got food. DO go here if you want to wait a long time for bad, overpriced food. 

You couldn't pay me to go back there."}
{"text":"The bar is somewhat decent, (But guiness is somewhat disappointing as they just pour it like regular beer on tap.)as the bartender/servers (whom are decent) will make the cocktails per the listed menu, and I can't say what they are capable of with regards to requests of specific drinks you may order to your specific liking(Such as Godfather, which is not on their listed menu.). The take-outs I definitely DO NOT recommend as they will be skim on the sauces (I have ordered three kinds and they had barely any sauce. I was probably better off ordering plain chicken and making my own conction at home,  or ordering from st.Louise and/or wild wings.). If the chicken you order has sauces that are wet in nature, they WILL pull a fast one to save a dime. The atmosphere is decent and there are few regulars who are on first name bases with the servers. Rowdiness control, (drunk person who becomes \"too friendly\" with other patrons and also orders a drink and being denied the said drink and being given a water instead, by the servers) is there so you don't have to worry about being harassed by other patrons too much in the establishment, which is good. I have actually seen a couple leave because of being subject to this particular incident.
One thing that I did like, that I have ordered from their menu was the burger. It was juicy and I would definitely order it again (It will cost you a pretty penny but decent for what it's worth, because you will have to add a few options to get some flavour to upgrade the burger from its plain state per say, depending on the person. I was NOT asked how I like my patty by the way, which tells you what we are looking at as far as the patty quality is concerned). The potato wedge looks  and tastes like a mass produced, thawed wedge from a package (You will get this on the burger, chicken, and everything else that states, or has options for a wedge, if you choose such an option.).
Overall a decent place to visit once in  blue moon if you are really running out of options and 24hr place isn't tickling your fancy, or just to have a one or two drinks of your favourite from their menu, if you have the will power to disregard everything else other than the drinks that you will have, which you have ordered."}
{"text":"If you enjoy waiting for unreasonable amounts of time for everything than this is the place for you. 3 servers and 19 guests total. Food order finally taken 30 min after being seated. Alot of socializing and not much working happening here. Now I remember why I stopped coming to this location."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has survived as long as it has.  It has this terrible cold interior.  Yes, I get it..it's like a rink.  But it's not like..a nice place to grab food, a beer and watch a game. 
The food is ok, nothing superb.  It could also be because I'm not a particular fan of wings...
But in general..it has a newbie vibe that you just don't want to come back to.
It's likely impossible to call this a \"regular\" bar since it's just so...cold and uninviting.
I'm giving it points because the food wasn't bad..it just wasn't good.

and i also have a soft spot for places with garage doors that open for the summer."}
{"text":"I have been to the Bloor St location now about 7 times.  I always get wings and always ask the cook to make them as hot as he can and they come out hot and flavorful.  I would say just as hot as Duff's Armageddon but with a lot more flavor. The wings are meaty and go great with some curly fires.

The only knock about this place is I have never scene the same server there in all the times I've been and they are not overly friendly.  Also the draft beer never taste fresh so go with bottles."}
{"text":"I always end up going to Puck'N Wings when I want to get out of the house for a pint with some friends, and not have to venture too far. Y&F is a good meeting point for those who live in the GTA/North York, and this is walking distance from bus routes/parking lots. 

Honestly, the nice thing about this place is that it is not ever really that busy. Meaning you get service quickly, food timely and a quieter/peaceful environment to relax in and not have to yell over music/other people to converse with your group.

This place can definitely use some sprucing up inside, as someone previously mentioned - it's an average sports bar - not meant to be trendy or upscale, but could use some love and upgrades.

I always order well done, flats only, lemon-pepper dry rub and I love the wings. They have Blue Moon (..or Belgian Moon in Canada) which is major bonus points for me. 

For an inexpensive, close to home, chill night out for a drink or wings - I will keep returning to Puck'N Wings as I always know what to expect. I know there are other wing places nearby but too loud and packed for my liking."}
{"text":"This place surprises me on how long they have been open for.  The service is horrible due to the fact that they are understaffed and the food really is not that good.  There are plenty of other wing joints around the nieghbourhood that offer much better wings and service.

They have tv's here but some of them are awkwardly placed.  The main tv's are all located behind the bar.  The food is subpar at best so come here with lowered expectations.

The service...well that is a different story all together. I am not sure if the servers are inexperienced, overwhelmed, or maybe just plain lazy.  It takes forever to get a drink and they cannot handle big tables at all. They seem to forget a lot of items and for whatever reason seem less enthusiastic to be there.

Anyways...come here for the beers but make sure you order 2 at a time so you do not have to wait for a server."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. Great place to watch your favorite  sporting event on one of the dozen HD TV's, there are 8 TV's at the bar alone. I always experience excellent service with a smile by all the staff.
My favorite place for chicken wings, located  walking distance from the Subway too,  at Finch Station. So many flavors to choose, try the Pucken Insane if you dare?"}
{"text":"Been several times over the years. I used to come when it was called Sweet Cheeks over a decade ago! 

Pros
There are over 30 wings flavours, and the best item on the menu. $12.50 per pound which is a bit steep.
One of the few places that still plays UFC fights. The popularity of the sport has been declining over the years. 

Cons
Mexican salad was ok, not worth $9.99 IMHO
$2 to switch from regular fries to sweet potato fries. 
Lighting is a bit dark and decor is dated. 

Damage $47 after tax pre-tip

Protip
There are 4 customer parking spots in the back of the restaurant. They are marked for Pucknwing customers. Entrance is the from Yonge St going East, same entrance that the TTC buses enter."}
{"text":"DEE-LICIOUS!

On my quest to find the best wings in this city, this place checks all the boxes!  If you are looking for variety in wings and want a whole platter of flavours to choose from, go to Puck n' Wings.  

As an avid Wing Woman, we ventured 2 llbs for 2 people, which was just right (had about 14 LARGE wings) and it's 1 flavour per pound.  So we chose the BATON ROUGE.  The nice watiress said it was medium spicy, but it was rather mild (I guess she had to stay conservative).  Then we ordered 1 pound of DRY RUB, CARIBBEAN JERK flavour - YUM!.  It was crunchy, flavourfull, salty, herby, what now!

On the side, I got the salad, extra celery and carrots, and creamy dill sauce.  All made for the perfect wing experience.  Service was great, the waitress was super helpful and friendly.  And they play loud rock music in there, great for me (maybe too much for others!)

To top it all off, they have really cool mirror posters in the bathroom.  It's an advertisement and then when you step in front of it to wash your hands, it becomes a mirror - BOOM!

I am excited waiting to go back and try other flavours.  I heard the BUTTER CHICKEN and the CAJUN DRY RUB is dee-licious!  

Let me know!"}
{"text":"The only kind souls open on Xmas!  Thank you

Great food ... try the edamame with the the fried pickles  and you beer! ... Canadian made and owned Moosehead!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever wings don't come with fries so I paid 12.99 for decent wings plus 3.99 for fries ... Sooo dumb and a pitcher only filed 3 glasses so I basically paid 25 bucks for shit NEVER GOING  BACK"}
{"text":"Stopped near Bloor and Spadina looking for pub food. 
Fox and the fiddle was our first stop. Bartender said the kitchen was open. Sit anywhere. It wasn't that the tables were dirty,  it was more that we sat at one table that had roll ups (cutlery) and that table was dirty too.
Further down the street we found The Puck Sportsbar. 
One young lady running the whole front end, she quickly told us the kitchen was open. 
She quickly got us menus and our drinks were at our table and food ordered in less time than it took the \"Fox and Fiddle\" people to let us walk out.
Food was good. We had Nachos with extra cheese and guacamole and a Chilli.
Chilli wasn't spicy(and we didn't want it to be) and the nacho chips were tasty.
Thank you Elaine, you are a great server."}
{"text":"I ended up here with some friends after walking around The Annex and it took a fairly long time for them to notice that we came in.  They do have a lot of different flavors, and the food was pretty good.  It took almost forty minutes after finishing dinner for somebody to show up with the check, which kind of threw off the experience."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I thought about holding one of these precious little stars back. If you care about wings, if the culinary niche of vestigial chicken bits and their manifold saucery is as close to your heart as it is to mine, this is a 2, tops.

But most people have more sense. They have, perhaps, a healthy respect for wings among other pub offerings, but no finicky obsessions. If you count yourself among this sane and storied number, PnW is okay. It's a sports bar, it doesn't hide it. The waitresses don't wear much, the beer is that same dismal array of mass market dreck, and there are TVs in every direction. On its face, nothing yet to rescue it from 2-ness.

The menu, though, doesn't suck as much as you'd expect. \"50 flavours of wings\" is a gimmick, but several of them are actually tasty. The Baton Rouge has nice flavour, as does the Golden Slapshot. If you like big flavour but less heat, they have a decent jerk, too. At their hottest, they are still not much of a challenge, but the wings are large, tasty, and cooked well (juicy, not greasy).

My secret kung-fu trick: edamame appetizer. Tasty, and easily enough for 2 or 3 to share, lets you lie to yourself about the healthiness of what you're about to consume."}
{"text":"Good wings, big glass of pop and good service! The place is a bit dull and sterile but I'd say it's an alright casual hang out spot before you hit up a nicer pub or bar."}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed this place before?

Its got a great location, right at the corner of Yonge and Finch.

Cheap drinks too. They're definitely not that bad.

I've come here so many times it's hard to count.

Highlights:

1. Sketchy Patrons who are fun to talk to when drunk. Just don't invite people to sit at your booth.

2. The food here is pretty standard fare.

3. Except for the build your own salad, which is fucking phenomenal. LOVE IT. There's a little sheet at your table, and you just check off in different compartments what you'd like in your salad. Theres the greens, the colour, the crunch, the veggies, the protien, the dressing. So awesome.

4. The waitresses are pretty nice.

5. THE BOOTHS ARE SO SPACIOUS. I have never had so much room in a booth before. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"No [insert pause], no [insert pause], no. Don't get me wrong, the service was good but the Mexican Salad was terrible (no flavour) and the Chicago Pizza tasted really bad."}
{"text":"I had wings, FANTASTIC. One of the best I ever had. Gf had calamari , Fantastic. Her sister had burger and sweet potato , Fantasia. Friendly and helpful staff and great service .will be back"}
{"text":"I work in the building across the street from Puck n' Wings and occasionally, a few of us go there for lunch. While I've never been dissatisfied with anything on the menu - other than the price ($7.99 for fries ... really?) their service is abysmal.  That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of three.

It's usually the same server who seems to hate her job and is absolutely miserable in her role there; she refers to everyone as \"honey,\" \"sweetie,\" \"darlin'\" or whatever term of endearment suits her fancy in the moment.  For her own well-being and the  accuracy of food orders (particularly the make-your-own salads), she needs to look for alternative employment.  

If you have an extra 30 minutes to spare during your lunch hour and the patience to repeat your order a number of times so that it gets done right, then you probably won't have the same experience as I've had. Like I said, the food is always good - it just tends to take too long to get the order correct, get served and get the bill."}
{"text":"I only recently got into wings, I always considered them too much work, too messy, for too little reward.

However Puck \"N Wings changed that.

Their dry rub wings were big and tasty, and I got adventurous and tried some saucy wings....

Now I hate... HATE.. having shit on my face when I eat. I hate messy food, especially in public. So saucy wings are a big no-no for me.

But their \"Dragon\" wings are out of this world (again my wing world is limited but still.. I have a palette).

That's all i order now, and the only reason I go there... just for the Dragon wings.

I only give it 4 stars because the staff is slow and kind of stunned. And it's always busy as hell, and full of people who like to YELL EVERYTHING THEY SAY EVEN IF ITS NOT SPORT RELATED HEY CAN YOU PASS ME THE SALT DID YOU KNOW THAT DAVE AT WORK LIKES GI JOES ISN'T THAT SO RANDOM"}
{"text":"One thing that confuses me is that with a name like Puck'N Wings, you would think that you would be prepared for lots of people on Saturday night. After all, Hockey Night in Canada on Saturday is one of Canada's biggest traditions.

Instead, we waited, and waited, and waited. When we looked around, there were only 2 waitress and one bartender in this busy restaurant. Two! At a place to watch hockey! On a Saturday night! 

Besides that, everything about P'N W was good. Wings were a good size and fries were really good. They also offer sweet potato fries but I felt the regular fries were much better."}
{"text":"Wings, sports and bros- I don't particuliarly love any of those things, but I've managed to find myself at PucknWings a few times now (likely due to bros). And I've enjoyed it every time! It has a fun atmosphere and tasty food. Lots of windows, nice servers, delicious Greek salad, guys yelling at tv screens, and a lot of Franks hot sauce ads...

The wings are good, I'd recommend going on a Monday cause they're half priced! They're good but not the best in the city......you'd have to go to Scarborough for those"}
{"text":"A friend and I dropped in here on the night of Christmas Day after an unsatisfying trip to the Madison (I know, I deserve it--who goes bar hopping on Christmas Day?) and had an enjoyable experience. The restaurant features a grotesque, overbusy menu with far too many choices and grade-school clipart of hockey players, with hokey names for their dishes, which, in a more general sense I find insulting to my intelligence. But the wings, with some sort of Louisiana sauce, were good, if not great; they were substantial in size, but really not spicy as promised. The bar has several ales on top, including a small town Ontario favourite in Labatt 50, which kicks this place up a notch.

The restaurant is well lit, with several TVs tuned in to sports. The bartender was really great--sweet, efficient, friendly, and tolerant of the Christmas Day bores who landed on her doorstep."}
{"text":"I have no issues with this location or with the anything at this bar in general. It's steps away from my house, the wings are actually some of the best I have ever tried because they are sewww meaty! The salads here are great - you get to select a whole bunch of ingredients you want in it and they custom make it for ya ;)

The servers have always been nice to me and they have some great specials, during the hockey season especially (but that's gone out the drain this year no?). Ask they server what's on special for the day and maybe you can get yourself an extra lb of wings for the same price.

BLACK AND TAN RINGS hooolllllaaaaaa!!! So nommy. They're kind of expensive, but the service is quire large and it comes with a really good chipotle sauce (it's a little more on the sweet side though).

SWEET POTATO FRIES hoooolllllaaaa x2!!!! They're crunchy, the portion is big and they're the ruffle-cut ones - the sauce really sticks in those ruffles ;)

Beer is normal price, I don't really remember how much a pitcher was but ballpark 15-17 bucks for a pitcher of Canadian. 

This isn't this kind of bar people would pull a mission to go to...it's just a spur of the moment pub if you're meeting someone at Finch or just want a late night drink (I go here alone. all the time. SO WHAT!?!???!!)"}
{"text":"Service sucks.

But wing sizes are consistently large with several flavors to choose from. Salads are pretty good, too.

Also there are a ton of TVs, and that's always a good thing.

And the beer selection really sucks."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Went to watch the UFC and the only seat available was at the bar. Happy that they turned up the volume for the main card and even dimmed the lights a bit. The wings and fries were very very good. Great draft selection. Service was attentive. Will go back."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings... more importantly, I love the sauce.  Now, I don't mean the wings need to be drenched in sauce.  Sometimes I prefer the sauce on the side.

My issue with Puck'n Wings is there was barely ANY sauce on the wings.  In fact, only about 3/4 of each wing had the slightest coating.  I thought maybe the sauce was super flavourful or hot, so I tried them sans sauce.... Nope, not overly flavourful or hot.

When I asked my server for additional sauce on the wings, I was told I had to pay for it.  I even went as far as to show the server a good portioin of the wings had no sauce.  She insisted if I wanted more sauce I would have to pay for it.

Since I was paying for the wings already, and I wanted to enjoy my meal, I agreed to pay for the extra sauce.  The waitress brought out the smallest container of sauce possible.  There was maybe an ounce of sauce in the container.

Needless to say, I did not enjoy my meal or the service... Nor will I be returning to Puck'n Wings ever again."}
{"text":"I went to have a quick beer and maybe wings as i live in the neighbourhood, but the two bartenders on staff were so rude to me that i left after my first beer.  The vibe is dead, the customer service is dead, the energy is dead... The only thing thats good is this beer (creemore on tap)... Only go here if u dont want anyone to find you, and you will seriously question your life choices the entire time!"}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Sunday with about 9 people. One of my friends wanted fish and chips and there wasn't any on the menu... but they had edamame beans for appetizer?!? 

7 of us all ordered wings. $11.99/lb and there were only 7 in a lb. Way overpriced if you ask me. It doesn't even come with fries. One of my friends ordered a wrap with sweet potato fries and when he asked if the fries came with a dip, he was informed that the dip only comes with the fries when you order the fries ala carte, not as a side order. WTH?

We ordered our drinks and food, drinks came relatively fast.. but the food took FOREVER. Got there just before 7pm and we didn't get our food till almost 8! and what's worse, not all the food came out at once. The server did not come by once to tell us why we were waiting or ask if we were doing okay. When we asked where our food was, she told us there were only two cooks working and they were overwhelmed. Considering there were only about 8 items on this menu, I was shocked. 

We finally finished out meal and asked for our bill. Ten minutes passed and still no bill. We asked again. Waited another give minutes. Still no bill. Asked a third time, finally! Our bill comes. We spent over two hours in this place that was not even half full.

Take your money somewhere else, this place is overpriced and the service is really crummy!"}
{"text":"$7 pint of Rolling Rock?  Get the fuck out of here.  2-stars for that.

But Sunday night is wicked fun - it's karaoke night and the crowd is wicked fun.  4-stars for atmosphere.

{"text":"Great location, right at Yonge and Finch corner. My wing to go place over past 7 years. Love the wings at this location. They have the best dry wing in town. I tried all, love it. Especially Cajun, salt and pepper, lemon zest are my favourite."}
{"text":"I think I ordered the wrong things on the menu. I could not wait to leave this place and could not bare to finish the food.

Chilli $6.99 - comes with unsalted nacho's and sour cream. The chilli was so bland and had no flavor at all. The beans in the chilli were not cooked long enough. I really couldn't finish the chilli it was so bad. I would rather have chilli at Wendy's or Tim Horton's.

1 lb of butter chicken wings $11.99 - I though I would try out a new flavor of wings and red a few reviews mentioning the butter chicken. I regret ordering this flavor. It did taste like butter chicken flavor but it just didn't taste right to me and once again I had a hard time finishing the wings. By the time I was done it looked like rats had chewed up the wings. 

1lb of dry rub Cajun wings $11.99 - This was actually pretty decent but after eater the chilli and the butter chicken wings I had already lost my appetite.

Service was quick and friendly

I don't think I will ever come back"}

{"text":"Dropped in while dropping my daughter off at U of T. Looking for a hamburger and a beer and this spot looked like it could deliver   Unlike other spots, this place actually had some people there on a Monday night. Beer selection is weak. Nothing if you enjoy a good hoppy craft beer. Next, they were out of hamburgers. Really?!!  I had a grilled chicken sandwich which actually was not bad. 
Workers on break would smoke on the patio right next to us. 
Great waitress but she had too many tables to keep up."}
{"text":"I've previously written a review on All Star, and stated that it is my absolute fave place for wings. Now this place comes to a very close second.
Please note that Puck n Wings have many location however this review is only reflecting food and service quality at this specific location. I'm in general not a fan of other Puck n Wing restaurants. So if All Star is packed, we'd drive all the way to this location instead of going to a location close to us.
I recon this location might need some fixer upper for it's decor. Everything seems pretty old and grimy. And for some odd reason, it's always pretty dark and gloomy inside. For all thing considered, it really stand a chance against other well packaged restaurants close by.
Once you give it a chance, the wings will impress you and make you want to come back. Their wings are a good size, so you get your money worth. Flavour is addictive. Instead of an overwhelming selection, you choose from a smaller selection of pretty damn good flavours. 
It's pretty specious. good for a backup when everywhere else is totally packed - hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"this place has character, and it might not be for everyone but the wings are VERY good
and the prices are average and what you would expect at a bar.

{"text":"The downside, the beers are distinctly average, the food is standard Canadian sports bar.

The upside, standard Canadian sports bar faire includes wings, it is the northernmost bar in the GTA accessible by subway.  

Anywhere else this place would be a n other boring sports bar, here at the crappy end of the Yonge line, this place is a heavenly oasis of old Canadian values, culture and culinary arts."}
{"text":"Went here to watch UFC 129.

It was a great experience (the place and UFC).

first off, i have to say, the size of the place allows it to give excellent service. Our server was amazing. Friendly, professional, funny and most importantly, around to keep up with our boozery.

There was a cover charge for the match (in order to maintain capacity, etc) and this was handled so well, we didn't mind. We made reservations, got an amazing table (best view of all TVs), manager was excellent in helping us coordinate, and then at the end of the night, given the enormity of our bill, he waived the cover for all of us. There were people without resi's, and they didn't stand a chance. The place was full by 7.20pm. But that didn't stop crowds from accumalting outside and watching through the windows, and the staff didn't stop them which i think is nice. 


The food was pretty good too. Chicken wings were big ( i had buffalo blue cheese) and awesomely saucy. Didn't think much of the nacho's, but they weren't bad. I think the best thing that my vegeterian friend ordered (who is surprisnllgy the biggest UFC enthusiast) is a build your own salad option. He made this monstrosity of a salad of goat cheese, beets, eggs, cucmcumbers, sunflower seeds, onions, tomatoes, etc. and there was no way he could finish it.

Beers and selection was good. Enough to allow us to have a phili friend try different things (good on them with creemore on tap). 

All in all, the place is intimate for a sports bar and thats a good thing for service. It's the only sports bar in the annex which is a welcome addition considering the demographic of the area.
TV's are all over the place, and appreciatively, also in the bathroom so you don't miss a beat.

Best thing, the place even made peeing fun. the urinals have hockey goals with a ball (not puck) in the goal that is fun to pee on and score."}
{"text":"This review is only for their curly fries takeaway that I ordered! Not many places have curly fries! Been craving it for awhile now! Seems the only place nearby that has them! Called as soon as I got off the highway and ready for pickup within 10 mins!! Quick & easy! The best part is they or it in reuseable containers! Still hot when I got home! Will def be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Warning: prepare to be surrounded by a sea of children who just turned 19 and all seem to go here as their first bar.  And underage kids with their first fake ID.

Slow service and bland tasting food.  Beer is ok.  TV's at the tables are mostly broken or have distorted colours (unless you get a seat at the bar which have the new ones). Very pricey for what you get if you plan on eating there (basically anything other than appetizers to share).

I sometimes end up here if every other bar is full, but i try to avoid it.  If you just want a beer then it's not bad, but don't expect much from the wings."}
{"text":"Immensely enjoyable takeout experience.  We decided to give this place a try after hearing favourable reviews from good friends (non-Yelpers) and also after reading Tina N.'s review.

The wings are large, battered and deep fried and then either tossed in a sauce or salt and spice.  We tried the Red Thai, Medium and Cajun dry rub and only wished that there was more!  All of the ones we selected were rated 2 on the six point spicy scale which was accurate.  

The Red Thai was spicy and sweet - tasting a lot like the dip you get with your spring rolls at a thai place.  The medium could've been more spicy but in fairness it was only a 2/6 on the scale.  The cajun dry rub was the winner of the night with its crisp batter reminiscent of a really good fried chicken.  

Fries are extra and they were inoffensive - not soggy, not too salty,  not particularly memorable but they didn't diminish from the wings which would have been a bummer.

We would definitely go back to try more flavours but would try for a Monday half-price night (eat-in only).  The pricing is curious, $9.99 for one pound, $19.99 for two and $51.99 for five - perhaps you get more carrots and celery with five pounds?

Hopefully this franchise can overcome the Shakespeare Cafe curse of this corner Annex location.  (RIP Cluck Grunt Low)."}
{"text":"I had to meet someone at Finch station and they were running extremely late so I popped in here to have dinner.

Though the Leaf's game was on and it was Saturday, it wasn't all that busy. The waitress was prompt and brought me a menu and asked if I had ever been here before, which I had not. She quickly went over the menu then took off to grab my pint.

When she came back I was ready. I went with a pound of the chipotle wings and a bowl of soup. She brought out the soup first which was nothing special. It was chicken noodle from a can. It hit the spot to help me deal with my cold but I wouldn't order it on a regular visit. 

The wings came out piping hot. They were nice an crispy and drenched in sauce. It wasn't quite the flavour I was expecting from a chipotle sauce but it was still tasty.

I had a few more pints while watching the rest of the game and the first period of the next. All-in it was $45 before tip. Pretty reasonable for the quality, portion size, and good customer service.\

{"text":"Oh my god. I never post reviews (this is my first one) but my experience here was so...strange? to say the least I HAD to post this. 

I passed by this restaurant often and from the outside, it looks so sketchy! I only came here because this was the only place to get curly fries in the area. 

Place was dead on a Saturday. No one greeted us in, so we just sat in the bar. There were two waitresses on the side eating (I guess there were on break?), talking to another three waitresses. One of them took our order, turned around, and then took lip gloss out of her purse (which was flat out right beside the shot glasses) and applied her make up right next to the register.

I guess the service was fast - it was just a coke and curly fries.
While waiting, I noticed a bottle of Windex next to the alcohol bottles. Luckily, everyone in the bar area (mostly 30-50 year old single men) were drinking beer and flirting with the waitresses who looked extremely bored. Kudos to them for their patience. 

Curly fries were amazing, zesty sauce was great. 

But we got in and out in 10 minutes. I would never trust to get wings or anything else for that matter from here! Unprofessional, smelly and so dark it made me feel shameful and embarrassed to walk through those doors.  Rather walk the extra block for st. louis."}

{"text":"I decided to go here with a friend last minute on a friday night. I was expecting this place to be happening since it was 12:30am but it was far from that. When we walked in we noticed maybe 2-3 people sitting around the bar and no one in the dining room. We decided to sit in a booth in the dining room. 

After looking through the menu for several moments I decided to order the chicken wrap while my friend ordered the BLT wrap. We also decided to order a bottle of wine to go with the meal. The first wine we chose the waitress had to inform us they didn't have it. I think she should have told us that as she handed us the drink menu. We then had to go with our second choice which wasn't bad.

When the waitress brought over the wine she began trying to open it. It looked like she had no idea what she was doing. The truth is she didn't she flat out admitted it that's she didn't know how open it and she was struggling. My friend took the embarrassment from her and helped her by opening it. Very surprised! 

When our food arrived I began to eat. I took a few bites and noticed I had no chicken in my wrap when I figured out that I was given the BLT and my friend was given the Chicken I wasn't upset but thought to myself what if I was a client who didn't eat pork that would have been a horrible experience! 

I do not think I will be returning anytime soon which is a huge shame as it is less than a 5 minute walk from my place."}
