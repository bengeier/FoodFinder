{"text":"Du poisson frais. Un staff sympa. Que demander de mieux? L'endroit est petit et charmant, pas de fla-fla.  Les Fish & chip sont excellents, que dire, ils sont super! Ils valent le détour ça c'est sûr. À chaque fois que j'y vais, je me dis que je vais essayer autre chose, mais non. Fish & chip always!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for pointing us to this restaurant.  We got fish and chips for take out.  The service was very friendly and fast.  The place was clean and attractive - a cute place! It would definitely be a place we'd go to if we lived in the area.  The fish and chips looked really greasy.  However, the breading was thin and light.  The fish itself was super fresh and very light.  So good! We got the beer battered fish and the maple batter fish.  The maple batter one had a hint of sweetness which we wanted more of.  All in all, the meals we're very good and ones we'd love to get again.    We also picked up a cup of clam chowder.  It was incredibly tasty.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Good fish & chips. Highly recommend the Cajun seasoning. Right on a busy road where you'd almost miss it but it's a little spot worth a visit."}
