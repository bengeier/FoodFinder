{"text":"Took my stepdad here for lunch on father's day. Excellent food. Fresh, generous, flavorful, fantastic. Go right now. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Great food,  fresh food , great delivery 10/10 , keep up the great work , I tried both chicken and carne...amazing !"}
{"text":"This is probably my 4th time having their food. The previous times were all delivery. I had the day off work and decided I'd make a stop to my favorite chicken spot.   Upon entering I was immediately greeted and my order was taken and placed. I was able to sit down and catch some Spanish TV while I waited. Though I don't know any Spanish I love the ambience it gives off as it reminds me of my grandparents watching their Spanish news. :)   Can't think of a better place to come and grab some amazing food by and family who really takes pride in what they do. Keep on being amazing guys!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down a secret gem in Meza, authentic cooked food on a charcoal grill. They serve bottles of soda as drinks and aguas frescas. You can order to go or pick up and get it to eat in. Awesome energy and the service is top notch. A mom and pop establishment with great owners; come and look for your self and you will not be let down. Anything off of the menu you will love and their salsa has many on their toes. Great for wedding or and any events as well  no hesitations on coming here when in town."}
{"text":"Randomly chose this place, checked out their Yelp, everything looked amazing and I was not let down.  Ordered a half and half plate. The foodwas dope and tasted great. Glad they're is another food spot near me.   Totally worth it, check it out."}
{"text":"Me encanta el pollo azado al carbón para chuparse los dedos  una rica comida que quedarás satisfecho !!!y la carne azada jugosa  !! me gusta con su guacamole y sus salsas con tortillas de arina hechas a mano !!!"}
{"text":"Found this hole in the wall gem on my way to work one night and was very impressed! Food was delicious, definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious:) we loved our food. Owner is really nice and the restaurant is really clean. It is right next dollar tree. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great find! A hidden little restaurant in the corner of the shopping center. It took us a little while to find it because there is no big lit up sign at the moment with the name of the restaurant but to make it easier for everyone, it's right by the dollar store.   We arrived pretty late, at around 8:20pm. 2 tables were occupied but ready to leave. We ordered at the cashier. The lady was very helpful and answered all my questions. She also let us know that because they cook everything to order, it'll take about 10 minute for the food to be ready. We ordered only one plate which is a mix of half a chicken and half pound of meat (beef). It is served with a side of guacamole, pico, beans (cooked without lard), tortillas (corn and flour) and a sauce that goes with the food. It also is served with quite a bit of toppings such as charred jalapeños, charred green onion, pickled onions, and radishes. We also ordered 1 Jamaica which is less sweeter than the other Jamaicas that I've tried.   The food came out fresh and it smelled great. The flour tortillas were pretty large and the corn were the regular small size. I made a chicken wrap for myself and then a beef wrap with all the toppings. Everything tasted delicious. The chicken was juicy and the meat was tender.   The service was excellent too. The owners are warm and friendly and very welcoming. They shared with us that they run specials on Tuesdays and Thursday's. They also cater and deliver within a 3 mile radius of the restaurant. They also offer 10% off for first time customers which brought our bill down to just over $17.   A 2-month old restaurant that's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best \"Pollo Asado\" and \"Carme Asada\" I've had in Az since I moved here in 2012. As someone that works in the food industry and has been doing it for 10 years, I can honestly recommend Pollos La Chuya. Food is amazing and the the owners, who are back there working all the time, are very friendly and actually make feel like you matter.  The restaurant is a bit hidden next to a Dollar store. Is super clean and like I mentioned before, the food is great! The \"Plato Campechano\" is my favorite! You get chicken and steak and a bunch of extras!  I highly recommend to anybody in the area to come and try this food! I live 25 minutes away and I still make the drive because is worth it! But if you're one of the lucky ones that live in the 3 mile radius, you can even get free delivery!  The best of luck to this new local business!  They have my business now!"}
{"text":"This chicken is amazing! I love their whole chicken platter. It easily feeds my family of four (2 young kids). So clean and best flavor!"}
{"text":"Stop reading this review.  Text your loved one.  Tell them \"we're going to Pollos LaChuya tonight\".   You're Welcome"}
{"text":"The original chicken al carbon in Mesa AZ. These guys are the real deal, you wont be disappointed, everyone here is nice, clean and the food is on point. Give these folks a try and support the locals."}
{"text":"It is truly amazing. They have very good grilled chicken and steak. They are very polite and super nice. I would recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Like Dora the Explorer says \"DELICIOSO!!\" I wanted to try something new and found this hidden gem. My husband and I shared the Plato Campechano. It was sooo good and the owners were very nice and helpful. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I have had their grilled chicken twice this last month. Take out on both occasions. It's wonderful, lots of great flavor and perfectly moist. You can see them make it after you place your order. You can't get any fresher than that. Had the rice and beans, and the yummy grilled pineapple and jalapeños. My kids ate it all! Tried the pineapple agua fresca on my second visit. Yum! It was a healthy and refreshing treat for my drive home."}
{"text":"Delicious! Large portions. Small, clean, very friendly service. A new favorite. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The carne asada is seriously amazing, and the whole place is legit Mexican food with a very sweet family run vibe.  The Plato is the way to go to try a little of everything and big enough to share.   We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great grilled chicken and prices are awesome! Would definitely come here again and tell my friends about it. It's pretty hidden and a little hard to find but definitely a little hidden gem. It's right next to the dollar tree on the left side Incase your looking for it."}
{"text":"Loved the marinated grilled chicken and carne asada. I came twice this week. I give it 5 stars for the food and service is ecvellent. You can order through grubhub. and takeout over the phone. Definitely great food like mommas cooking! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome new family owned restaurant. If you have been to and are a fan of Rocky Points Lucas's Chicken you will Love this place. Genuine mesquite grilled chicken. Clean friendly and all family. I'm not part of the family yet but I hope you check it out and support locally owned businesses like Polos La Chuya. Tucked away so look carefully. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious. Food has a lot of flavor, big proportions, and worth the money. They deliver, Grubhub, and have door dash. I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Great/quick service! Hard to find delicious HEALTHY options these days and this is definitely delicious healthy spot."}
{"text":"We live right next door to this diamond in the rough,  we could smell the deliciousness from our home. We just had to stop by, it's a small place but it packs a huge flavor. We had an order and a half order of the meat it was delicious the beans were AWESOME *come included. The salsa was so tasty , needless to say we aren't going anywhere else for Mexican food, oh and did I mention the flour tortillas are home made? Check them out you will be back I know we will! Animo buen lugar."}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch there recently. Their food has so much flavor and you can tell they put a lot of thought into their ingredients and dishes. Great guacamole. Definitely true Mexican food you won't find just anywhere!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavor, well cooked, and overall a great service and clean place. Prices are very decent for a whole chicken which will serve two people just about right."}
{"text":"Great new place that serves up a classic Mexican recipe in style. We got the chicken plate and asada burrito and both were delicious. Both kinds of salsa are flavorful and the right level of spice."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! Ordered a whole chicken and one lb of carne asada which came with 4 sides, guac and tortillas. All the food was delicious and I felt like we got a lot for our money which is rarely the case these days. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and steak.  OMG!  They served the meal with beans, guac, pico, and salsa, and a side of tortillas (both corn and flour).  My husband and I decided to try this little place, after my husband spotted a flag earlier while he was driving by.  The main plate (we order the combo with chicken and steak) was a mound of delicious meat with pickled onions, sliced radish, and roasted jalapeños. The chicken was crunchy in the outside and juicy inside, with a flavor that explodes in your mouth.  The steak was cut into manageable pieces.  I made myself a couple of tacos with the chicken and just ate the steak with the beans and veggies.  The combo was just perfect for us.  We ate all the meat and left a little bit of guac and salsa.  It was quite a bit of food that I thing would even feed 3 people.  We both had jaimaicas for drinks, and they were just sweet enough and thirst quenching.   The prices were really reasonable.  The service was friendly and fast.  And the place was clean and well lit.   I would be more than glad to go to this place again, and again, and again... For sure I am bringing family and friends to enjoy Pollos La Chuya's delicious food!"}
{"text":"I downloaded yelp to give these guys a review. Great food, me, my girlfriend, and her sister had the Plato campagnolo it was enough food for the three of us and was only 6$ each. The owner was a cool guy, we could see him preparing the food. Really enjoyed this place highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is completely out of the way for us but we'll definitely be coming back. It's such a hidden little gem. Everything was amazing real authentic Mexican food. Chicken was delicious just how I like it, so we're the beans, salsa and honestly everything! It's a must if you're in the area:)"}
{"text":"I went into this place on 3-28-18 and ordered the Half Pollo plate with a coke. Total price was about $12. The chicken was smokey, tasty, not moist, but not dry either, and overall not too bad (solid 4 stars). The charro beans were also good and the salsa was delicious. I called in the order, and 5 mins. later the order was waiting for me at the counter. I called it in, since one of the reviews stated they make the stuff fresh (dont know if this is true). However, I was in a hurry, so was glad my order was ready. Its a small place in a corner in the shopping complex next to the dollar store. The cashier was friendly, food was overall good, and would like to eat here again. The 1/2 pound of chicken meal is a lot food for one person (probably good for two) and would probably order the 1/4 pound lunch special next time. If you are looking for an alternative to pollo loco without the commercial aspects, then is the place for you."}
{"text":"I mean if isn't broke, don't fix it. If you can operate a business successfully with only two options of choice ( other than size and sides) freaking A...do it. This place Rocks.   I ordered the Medio Pollo dish with my side being a very well prepared salad that was fresh and great. The stopper though is the way they cook their meat. It's done on a huge mesquite grill. The chicken had a very nice char to it, the outside was crispy with so much flavor, there was that ring on the meat that shows low and slow and the inside was super tender and juicy. Their salsa has a good flavor that pairs well and I love that it is not chunky.   Customer service is huge to me and the guy that helped me was great! I will definitely be back.   I love it when a family restaurant is so into what they do and they prove it with pride, quality, excellent tasting and looking food, customer service and all with a  killer price tag. High five to Pollos La Chua"}
{"text":"Great hidden place! I tried it like 2 weeks ago and I've been going almost every other day! Chicken is good!! And Carne Asada is amazing!! Great flavor! All the side are great! Owners are very welcoming and very nice people. Over all 10 out of 10!   Gran, gran, lugar! Está medio escondido pero la comida está increíble! El sabor que le dan al pollo y ala carne es muy muy buena! Todos los \"sides\" también están deliciosos y todo a gran precio. Los dueños son muy buena gente y muy amables. A este lugar le doy 10 de 10 en todo!"}
{"text":"Sabor autentico y precios muy accesibles. Todos son muy amigables y el servicio es rapido."}
{"text":"Today was our second time stopping here for dinner. All i gotta say is bom.com. It hit the spot. Being from california hard to find a good mexican shop an this is my new spot. Wife ordered the medino plate an i ordered the half chicken half steak. Nothing to complain about. Food was on point. Staff is friendly an service for most part is fast. One suggestion, maybe free chips an salsa for the wait. I will be returning again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We order delivery just about every week. Whole chickens, flour tortillas, even their rice and \"beans from the pot\" are bomb."}
{"text":"amazing. we had the plato campechano (1/2 carne asada and 1/2 chicken). we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pollos La Chuya is a small family-owned restaurant tucked away in the corner of a busy shopping center and featuring a short but highly perfected menu. They serve mesquite grilled pollo and carne asada with traditional sides and trimmings. The owners are welcoming and quick to make recommendations. They suggested the plato campechano, and I'm glad they did since that meant we didn't have to choose between the chicken or the beef. Both were wonderful, the flavorful marinades and smoke mingling perfectly in the meat. For $15.99, the plato campechano comes loaded with tasty sides--too many to list here--and could easily feed two hungry adults. I also added on a side order of grilled pineapple (just $.75!), and was very happy for it.  Please don't come here expecting fast casual. This isn't Chipotle--there will be no heating trays of pre-made food in sight. Miracles take time, in this case about ten minutes to prepare your order, but your patience will be greatly rewarded. The restaurant is clean and cheerful, or you can call ahead to order takeout. Pollos La Chuya is a hidden treasure, the kind of friendly neighborhood spot anybody would want in their backyard, and it is well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"This place is so good and everyone here is so nice and friendly.  The food is authentic, fresh and beyond delicious. Great place to eat! You have to try you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We ordered the 1/2 LB de carne al carbon and ate it all up. I recommend adding an additional side of flour tortillas to your order for the huge pile of carne you will be receiving. Best tortillas I have ever had! Restaurant is clean and the staff was very friendly. Next time I plan on trying an asada burrito."}
{"text":"Hard to find...but so glad we didn't give up! What this place lacks in signage they more than make up for with the food.     The shop is sparse and clean and the owners are hard at work tending the grill and to the customers. We popped in for lunch and ordered the Plato Campechano so we didn't have to make the difficult decision of chicken vs steak and for $15 we got a huge plate that more than fed two of us with food to spare.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken had great taste and very crispy well cooked however the meat/carne was a bit thick for being carne asada. Tortillas were under cooked. I ordered la campechana was a to much $$$ that serves for 2 persons when we are 4 in a family so it does get costy. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Really good Mexican.  They also deliver bus GrubHub they will be on my rotation!"}
{"text":"This Is the best place ever.  This is what el pollo loco wants to be.  I was literally sad when my plate was empty."}
{"text":"Great find.  Food exceeded my expectations!  Service was fast and friendly.  Not busy when we got there but it appears they do quite a few to-go orders.  Our food arrive to our table 3-5 minutes after we placed our order.  Food was flavorful, the chicken was grilled to perfection and the carne asada was good too, if undecided go with the chicken.  The sides are good too (our oder came with guacamole-made from real avocado, fresh pico de Gallo, salsa, and beans)...beans and tortillas were some what on the cold side, I like my beans and tortillas hot, but that's just my preference.   The last thing we tried was the grilled pineapple - tasty and sweet, but pricey(one slice for $0.75).  Overall, good place and reasonable prices, I will return."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed the food from here. It was real \"al carbon\" beef and chicken with home made tortillas. We recommend it and we will visit often."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for leading me to this little whole in the wall place. This family owned restaurant has something special that other chicken places don't...that is the best grilled chicken in town! I've ordered delivery (free if you are in their delivery area) a few times and will continue to do so. Each time we ordered the whole chicken. The sides we chose was rice and beans. Everything they make comes out right and to perfection. This place is definitely a hidden gem in Mesa and I've been telling my family and friends to spread the word. Order delivery, dine-in, or take out...you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I did not like the chicken. It was to dry. Idk I did not enjoy it and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife this evening based on Yelp reviews.  The reviews were spot on!  The food was great.  My wife got the large pollo plate and I got the combination plate.  It was a lot of food and we took home a bunch to enjoy tomorrow for lunch as well.  The flavors were very good.  I think I enjoy the asada a little more than the chicken but it was pretty close to a tie.  The owner was ther and he is very friendly and and customer service was excellent.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"I got takeout of the 1/2 chicken meal & it was fantastic.  The employees were very nice, good amount of food for the price. The flavor of the chicken was amazing & the flour tortillas remind me of Puerto Penasco. Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Tried it on a whim via Grubhub. Will definitely keep this place in my local restaurant rotation. It's like having Pollo Lucas (in Puerto Penasco-great food) near my house (not as cheap of course). Awesome.   Ordered a whole chicken with rice, beans, and macaroni salad. Ordered corn tortillas and made my own tacos. The chicken was wonderfully marinated and the fresh salsa was so good. I liked the roasted jalapenos and pineapple with the order. Yum!"}
{"text":"This reminds me so much of a place in Puerto Vallarta Mexico.  Wonderful grilled meats and the condiments. Cannot go wrong.   tasty friendly inexpensive and authentic."}
