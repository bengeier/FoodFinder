{"text":"Un très beau restaurant et un excellent repas... Du lunch le midi au souper en Amoureux, en passant par un petit repas en Famille.. C'est le petit restaurant Italien à ne pas rater à Lachine.. En Bref: prix corrects, service parfais et efficace... Beau et Bon restaurant !!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Perfect location near the lake shore and the service was also great. Spent the afternoon on the terrace. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As someone who knows, Lachine very well and grew there. Pasta Andrea has been my number one go to restaurant.   The place is usually very full during the weekends and, on Friday's nights. The service is amazing, and the food is delicious. My friends, and other family members have adored this restaurant dearly. Totally recommend for those, who comes to Lachine."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30am on a Friday with a friend and was hoping for a table on the terrasse. The greeting by the hostess was less than welcoming, who said she would check to see if they could accommodate us without a reservation. She disappeared inside for nearly five minutes and then seated us at a table outside. The place was completely empty at this point - we were the only ones there.   At around 12:15, people started showing up and the terrasse did fill up quite a bit. Unfortunately the clientele this place seems to attract is the loud, boisterous, obnoxious types. They seem to be regulars, as the waiters are all super friendly with them.  One waiter in particular came out of the restaurant yelling and singing to his table of \"friends\" - it was very rude for the rest of us, who had to stop talking & wait til he was finished.  Now, the food. The stracciatella soup was awful! Vegetable broth from a Campbell's can with some egg and (potato????) - that doesn't belong in there!!!  Tasteless. I had two spoonfuls.  The veal Parmesan on the table d'hôte was well priced ($15) but you get what you pay for. The tomato sauce was bland. Pasta was well cooked, but the veal was small and nothing special.   The dessert was a Crème Caramel. Where was the caramel??  All I could taste was the orange slice they put on top of it.  My friend and I are both Italian - the rest of the clientele here was French (and all seemed to love the food). I think our taste can be trusted more than theirs!   Won't be back. Ever again. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"What happened to Pasta Andrea? It's been well over seven years since I last ate here. Unfortunately today will be my last time eating here! I will certainly not be coming back. Which is quite unfortunate considering I \"had\" very fond memories of the restaurant.  It's 1:15pm on a lovely sunny Saturday and only two tables are filling the restaurant. Yes, just two. That's a bad sign already. Yet, let's give it a try anyways.  The looks, decor, and tables look.. Ok. Nothing to bribe about.  In the background there was lovely Jazz music, sadly it was covered by the heavy metal full blast music coming from the kitchen. The chef and waiter didn't notice this?! Was it necessary for us to ask them to kindly turn it down?!  We were a table of three and ordered three dishes. Two of them were cannelloni and the other was a pizza. Nothing too complicated, right? Well, it took 45 mins to arrive to our table. The food was warm, not hot. We were offered Parmesan cheese and freshly ground pepper. Good thing the pepper was fresh. Since the cheese clearly was grated months ago and came out of a bag! Ugh!  My pizza(tomato sauce, goat cheese pesto, and mozzarella. Where is the pesto?!! Parsley is not pesto! Goat cheese is not Brie. Don't just cut think circles of Brie cheese mixed with goat cheese and slap it on top of the pizza at the price of $14.00.  The cannelloni  claimed to be made in house with fresh made dough.  It clearly came from a package or simply was made days before and frozen.  Sorry pasta Andrea, next time I will be heading to Little Italy for better quality and fresher food. This time, you've disappointed me."}
{"text":"The short version:  absolutely *smashing* food;  badly-made, piss-warm martinis;   almost deliberately negligent service;  the whole in a delightful riverside setting.  I live nearby and have been eating here for years, off and on, and the pasta's always been reliable, if not downright memorable.   Hadn't been in a while.  So, when a friend offered to treat me to a late lunch this past Sunday, I decided a bowl of linguine by the river, al fresco, at Pasta Andrea would do nicely.  I'd had serviceable gin martinis here a few years back, and felt confident in ordering them for my friend and me while we perused the menu.  Mistake.  The proportions tasted right, as in, there was definitely vermouth in them, and they were served in proper cocktail glasses.  However, they came with olive instead of the requested lemon, they came with *lime wedges* as well, and they certainly hadn't been stirred with or shaken over ice.  Jesus H. Christ, but this is the absolute worst town to be a martini drinker in.  I should have stuck to Campari & tonic.  We drank them anyway, because we both wanted booze in us.  Ordering food was easy.  Mademoiselle spotted a salmon spaghetti in rosé sauce on the table d'hote and need no further options, whereas I went with an à la carte mashup of linguine al pesto novello.  Market salad for her, arugula salad for me.  Asked for an order of bruschetta to nibble on, but was told it wasn't on for lunch; only for supper.  Odd.  A couple of glasses of Sangiovese topped off our orders.  I find it goes well with pesto sauce.  Bread arrived, one roll each.  Looked like they came from the corner dépanneur, but they were immediately consumed.  Bread barge was bussed and never refilled.  Our water glasses were infuriatingly small, considering we were dining outdoors on such a bright-hot day.  Getting refills involved standing up and attracting a waiter's attention every time, and once I had to go inside to ask.  We kept draining our glasses, and they kept not refilling them.  Somewhat maddening, considering the place was only filled to 30% capacity.   Our salads arrived quickly, and immediately made amends for the poor drinks and lack of bread and water.  Both were huge, near-overflowing platefuls of visibly fresh vegetables.  Not a wilted leaf in sight.  The light oil-and-vinegar dressing on my arugula salad was *perfect*, and the cheese shavings were delicious as well.  Mademoiselle's mixed greens and tomatoes disappeared down her pie-hole like Flight 19 before I could blink, and she pronounced it excellent.  The main courses followed after a reasonable interval.  Again, full-sized portions.  My friend's salmon spaghetti seemed to meet expectations- normally a gabby little creature, she lost all power of speech while she gorged like a lemon shark devouring a nest of eels.  My own plate surpassed expectations.  The pesto novello was a basic green pesto with the addition of rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes.  They used actual pine nuts, too.  The sauce was superb, needing only a bit of salt to make it one of the best pasta sauces I've tasted anywhere.  My pasta itself was al dente, and the plate arrived *hot*.  Ate all the bits of it, and felt I'd chosen damn well.  I had to go inside again to get our plates bussed and ask for a dessert menu.  Mademoiselle being addicted to tiramisu, reading it  took her all of five seconds.    Then we were told they'd run out of tiramisu and they were making a fresh batch.  \"Should be no more than ten minutes.\"  She was undeterred and agreed to wait.  I opted for a glass of grappa.  The tiramisu in fact arrived in about three minutes, and was very beautifully served in a chilled cocktail glass- a variational presentation that did away with all but one of the lady fingers.  Mademoiselle's eyeballs positively bulged as she tasted the first spoonful. She gave it top marks for flavor, and said she had never had one that tasted so fresh.  Licked her glass clean like an anteater.  Had to go back inside again to ask for the bill.  And then again, to ask for the credit card to be taken away and swiped.  And neither of us was being Type A impatient about things, either.   They were really taking way too long between peeks at us, even by Montreal's very shitty standard of acceptable restaurant service.  In New York City, these guys would have been raked over within thirty minutes, live on twitter.  Restroom:  Clean, perfectly usable, but a bit messy.  This'd be a four-star review if the cocktails and the service had been even near acceptable, because the food that day was all top-quality, and the riverside view from the porch was idyllic.  The waiters and busboys were unfailingly well-mannered, too- when we saw them.  It's just that they seemed blissfully unaware of our presence throughout the entire meal except when they needed to bring out a plate.  Will probably go back at some point, strictly for the food and the setting. Service will decide if it's my last visit."}
{"text":"Pour manger une pizza aussi banale et surgelée, autant l'acheter a l'IGA et rester chez soit.  C'est aussi bon et bien moins cher !"}
{"text":"It was nice place in front of water! The food was good enough and delicious! 2 times a year it's fine for these restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"Being my first visit to any restaurant in Lachine this was my daughter's choice as it was close by to her new home.  We opted to sit inside as we did not want to be bothered by bugs outside - however many patrons seemed happy to sit in the sun.  This is a simple, casual spot for basic Italian food.  We were promptly seated at a nice table and offered a complimentary bruchetta on toast.  The house red wine was tasty and went well with our pasta dishes.  I ordered the manicotti which was pretty good but found the tomato sauce to be a bit runny.  The crusty rolls were tasty but the butter was frozen and not allowed to soften before serving.   Desserts were good.  Service throughout was attentive.  Also, the bathroom was nice and clean.  Pasta Andrea was o.k. and I will probably visit again if in the area but will try some other establishments first."}
{"text":"Got brought here for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7.   The staff (Matt?) were kind enough to seat us in the section we had clearly been eyeing and was prompt with his service right from the start. He was incredibly knowledgable of the wine selection and was able to suggest a newly stocked bottle when the Shiraz we had wanted to order was no longer being offered. His serving etiquette itself was bar none. He knew the dishes to great detail and was easily able to convince my friend to take his suggested dish. It's the only place I've gone where the service staff specifically asked if we'd like an aspiratif.  Bruschetta was offered while we waiting for our meals which included the asparagus soup, pasta duo, salmon main and creme brûlée. The food was delicious with little touches that really perfected the flavors and added great value to the meal. We were even offered sambuca to close the meal which was a nice effort on behalf of the management.   The decor was cozy and hip with exposed wood, hand painted graffiti style wall, mirrors, mannequin legs and industrial lighting. I can't imagine how wonderful a dinner would be enjoyed here during the summer on the edge of the lachine canal."}
{"text":"Excellent souper italien en famille et en couple sur la terrasse. Nourriture excellente et très bon service."}
{"text":"If Macaroni Grill opened a restaurant in Montreal, it would probably be a lot like Pasta Andrea. Mix and match pastas, wine by the liter (or is it litre?) and really tacky artwork all make me feel like I'm back home in America. Like most generic Italian joints, some dishes are really good (calamari) and others not so much (the bruschetta).  Credit to the waitress for being very patient with those of us who couldn't read french.  If you live this close to Montreal, I'm sure you've got better options. If you're staying at a house just down Boulevard Saint-Joseph and want to stumble home after a few pitchers (yes, pitchers) of wine, this is your chance."}
{"text":"I've heard so much positive reviews about this place, but was very disappointed. The service was not the best even though only two tables were busy. The food was terrible! My seafood smelled a bit and I couldn't eat it. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente, très bon service et ambiance décontractée parfaite pour un souper d'amoureux ou entre amis."}
{"text":"We checked this place out after a recommendation from a friend. To be honest, it was one of the worst Italian restaurants I have ever been to. Not bad because of the food, but a combination of the service, price and the food. The waiter hadn't a clue about anything, not even what type of beers they carried and had to keep on going up and down the stairs to ask his colleagues questions.  The bread was cold and the butter frozen (don't you just hate that!!) The pasta was hmm ok, a little bit on the kraft dinner side. Ambience is nice but the attitude and the food killed it for me."}
{"text":"Dans mon top 2 des Terrassses sur le bord du canal... La qualité des plats sont exceptionnelle et que dire de l'emplacement!"}
{"text":"This place isn't good. Most people can make better Italian at home. Basic pasta plates. I took duck confit which was disappointing. You know a restaurant is bad when you can make better dishes at home. Decor is bad too. Service is acceptable. The only positive are the wine portions which are generous."}
{"text":"Petite terrasse agreable, decorée avec fleurs, joli balcon , bon service, bonne bouffe, cafés italiens, drinks et desserts mmmm"}
