{"text":"This is the worst shoeless joes I've been to.  I came here with a few co-workers after work on a Friday and the service was horrible.  1) their drinks were watered down, when we complained about it, they told us that it's suppose to taste like that 2) we waited almost an hour for our food 3) when our food did come, it was cold.   The servers were not attentive at all -  The place wasn't even busy and we didn't order anything fancy, just the normal stuff like wings, fries, poutine so there shouldn't be any excuse on why we had to wait so long.. Our night out was ruined, and we will never go here again."}
{"text":"The food at Shoeless Joe's isn't very good.  The place however has a great deal of charm and grows on you.  The bar gets busy from time to time and when you go downstairs to use the washroom you can almost hear the stories of legendary nights of drinking there.

The waitresses are super friendly and they do a lot to make you feel at home.  If you are going to eat, their wings are okay as are the pizzas."}
{"text":"I have stayed in the hotel attached to shoeless joes for a few months for work reasons. I have been to the bar a few times. Always disappointing.  When my beer is empty i always have to ask for another after waiting for the bartender to return to the bar. Just about evertime. They are seldom tending the bar. They are rood. Lazy. They have there group they tend to and its seems a bother to them to serve anyone else. I mean all of the waitress and bartenders are the same. The place is run down and dirty. Leading  down stairs to the bathroom there was a thick trail of dried blood then in males bathroom there a dried puddle on floor. It was walls counter door and door handle. Which more then proves the lack of cleanliness and total disregard for the customers. Also i have been sick after eating there a few times. I refuse to return ever again"}
{"text":"Party of 7, Friday night, no reso. Service was a bit slow but our waitress was very friendly. A very big food and drink menu. I asked to try a sample of Chardonnay but they don't offer samples so I ordered a cocktail instead which was enjoyable.
I enjoyed the Vegelicious burger with Mediterranean salad. My husband ate the  Bacon Cheddar burger and Waffle fries. We both agree our meals were good but nothing outstanding. Do check out the dessert menu though, you won't be disappointed...unless you are looking for fat free options!
A decent very casual sports bar with busty servers."}
{"text":"Took an extremely long time despite there being very few customers. The check arrived before food and even some drinks. Not to mention, very overpriced."}
{"text":"Primarily a beer connoisseurs bar with over 200 differnt kinds of beers from all over the world including a good variety of Canadian Microbrewers. Serves great food (pasta & oysters). Blues/Jazz music fills the air. 
Smokers are welcome but confined to the Pavement patio to supp and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. Service was outstanding. Food was good. I have been twice, I definitely plan to be back."}
{"text":"Great place, good food, horrible service :(  ordered two appetizers, three drinks, and three pounds of chicken for two people in total, and the waiter constantly bugged us during a UFC match. Shouldn't $62 worth of meal for only two people last for a match?! The waiter was watching the game behind our booth and was so engaged with the game himself, I couldn't ask for refills on drinks and water as much as I'd like to. Also, I wasn't informed of the extra charge on refills of fountain drinks if I switched drinks in between, and ended up paying ten bucks for soda. 
I really wish I get a better server next time because the chicken was really good."}
{"text":"I feel weird giving this a four star rating, but it does deserve one. 

Put it this way: There are crappy Tim Horton's locations and there are awesome Tim Horton's locations. There are Timmy's where weird patrons loll about and you look around thinking, \"Is he even wearing pants?\" and there are Timmy's where the server is sunny and smiley and the donuts seem to be warm from the oven 24/7. Just because it's a chain, doesn't mean all locations are the same, or even as good as each other.

This is a good Shoeless Joes.The food is what you'd expect: average, tasty, filling (perogies, pizza, sliders, chocolate cake, cosmopolitan and a beer all went down easy, no complaints). 

It being the first day the place was open, I should probably wait a few months before judging the cleanliness but, as you'd expect, it was spotless and the bathrooms were pristine.

I guess the best thing about this place is that every booth has a TV. You never have to spend your entire meal with your back to your table just to watch the match, or try and see around people at the next table who are there to see the same game.

Bottom line: It's Shoeless Joes, but it's a fancy, NEW Shoeless Joes that would almost (ALMOST, guys) pass for the most casual of first date venues. Maybe upgrade to MIlestones..."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday with some friends and it seemed like a slow night.
The service was quick but could have been friendlier.
This place is just ok to grab a beer.
We tried the buffalo wings which were delicious but the quantity was disappointing.
Overall, it is a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"we're not much of drinkers but I would totally return! food was amazing service was delightfully wonderful, we will return again and again I had the wings as a meal and I can barely eat it all my husband got chicken mushroom rice he absolutely loved it but the green beans were to die for. definitely a must when in the area"}
{"text":"food okay for pub fare but the service suck's! i waited twenty minutes for a beer and i was sitting at the bar??? bartender just serves who she knows and doesn't care about anyone else! hope her boyfriend doesn't show up because then you'll wait even longer!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Came here to watch the Euro 2016 Soccer Finals in the summer. There's probably a reason that even during a Final's game, this place isn't packed. We got there about an hour before the game actually started. Surprised, it was very empty with only 2 other patrons in the entire place. At least we were guaranteed our pick of seats to watch the game! 

SERVICE: The bartenders practically ignored us the entire time and didn't clear away our food trays and napkins after my friend and I finished eating. Previously, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes just to get their attention and finally order. The staff looked miserable and overworked.

FOOD: I ordered the burger sliders, and it was mediocre. Nothing special. A bit overpriced. The buns were practically straight out of the fridge and untoasted. Meh.

ATMOSPHERE: The only thing functioning that day were the TVs - can't screw that up! This place mostly attracts older, 40-60 year old men, though. Very casual and chill vibe. My friend and I were probably the youngest people there.

Probably won't be back unless we're in the area and super desperate and to find a sports bar."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I went here for the first time on Aug 24, 2015. The service was absolutely horrible.

The server was nice with was the only positive but she was no where to be found. There were 2 customers in the restaurant and it took 10 mins for her to come out to seat us.

She was then quick with our drinks but took another 15 minutes to come back to get our order. I walked around the restaurant looking for her because we were ready to order but I couldn't find her.

The food was horrible, I ordered their classic burger so it could be a quick lunch. The burger bun was nasty and my meal was cold.

Not a very good first experience and will be my only one."}
{"text":"I recently went here for dinner with a group after seeing a play just down the street at the JCC. We sat outside on the patio, which isn't anything special or nice but the weather was good. Inside seems much nicer in terms of decor and atmosphere. 

The drinks were fine but often took a while for refills, especially water even when asked. The food was below average. I ordered the chicken with wild mushroom risotto from the \"new\" menu. They had butterflied the chicken breast and then WAY over cooked it. It was very, very dry and actually hard to cut. The risotto was the only good part of the meal, it wasn't amazing but decent. The green beans that came with it were overcooked, waterlogged, unseasoned and bland. My husband's Havana sandwich (pulled pork) was ok, the pulled pork was good but the bread was a bit hard and the toppings were weird. The fries were way over salted but some people like that. The people with us had some hits and misses. The flatbread and truffle burger were the hits of the meal and the only people that had no complaints. We ordered coffees at the end, which were cold except for mine, because I ordered decaf I guess they had to make it fresh. 

The worse part about this place was the service. Our waiter was nice enough when he served us but he was missing for long periods of time and when he reappeared wouldn't have the water or napkins or whatever that we asked for. There was only one other table outside and it was pretty quiet inside too but when I'd go to the bathroom our waiter would be chilling behind the bar and chatting with the bartender and someone sitting at the bar (a regular perhaps?) . But above and beyond the waitress, who wasn't even ours, was the low point. She had big boobs, which you can't help, but was wearing a serious push-up bra and shirt with a V that went down to her belly button. I have no issues with boobs, and am in no way a prude but if I wanted hooters that's where we would have gone. She wasn't even working our table but helped bring things out a couple times. She was blatant in winking at my husband and touchy with my dad. I'm sure she gets great tips and I can't fault her for flaunting what's she's got to make a living, but dude we're not tipping you cause we're not your table so it just made us ALL uncomfortable! (My 67 year old dad who is usually totally oblivious to just about everything commented on it). 

Basically, you're not going to die of food poisoning but there are so many better places around where you'll get better food, faster and with better service for the same price (or cheaper). I have no intentions of ever going back again."}
{"text":"delicious burgers!!! delicious food!! the wings were eh, typical..nothing too exciting...but overall great waitress and very friendly!!! I guess toronto isn't pet friendly when it comes to dining outside the patio with your furry friends...but i sat on the corner and the waitress let me tie my dog leash on the inside corner so he's not too far away from me..plus there wasn't any people around us at all at the time...very accommodating.. i'm just used to chicago and how pet friendly restaurants are here with pets and all...anyways overall i had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"I was excited that a new pub opened close to U of T, but after dining here for lunch today I surely won't be back.

I came here with a friend for a \"quicK\" lunch just after 12. We ordered quickly and thought that 45 minutes would be enough time to eat and get back to school. Our drinks came quickly, but the food took longer than I'd expected, given our that what we ordered was pretty basic, and because there were maybe 2 other tables occupied in the entire restaurant. I didn't think it would take 20 minutes to fry up some chicken wings, prepare a chicken wrap, and toss up a salad.

The food was fine -- nothing bad to report but nothing to write home about. What killed it for me though was the price. What I thought would be a small quick lunch came to over $50! 

-Friend's Beer -$7.25 -- (sounds steep for students!), 
-2 Cokes - $2.50 each
-Half-Portioned Wrap with Side Salad - $8.49 (although they unknowingly charged me an extra dollar for a salad, even though on the menu it was written as a side option)
-California Salad - $12.99
-1lb Wings - $10.99 (These were ridiculous. 6 wings for $11. Are you serious?) 

I was pretty shocked. I'm a student, and I expect lunch to cost between $10 and $15, not $25 each. For $25 you could get WAY better value for your money. This was absurd.

Sure, the place is new and clean and quite beautiful inside, but I sure as hell won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food here, I know that not everything comes from a fresh market but it shouldn't taste like frozen food either. We got salmon which was dry, too heavily seasoned and bland taste. Prices were outrageous for the quality of the fish, I understand it's salmon but charge for quality not just because it's salmon and the name itself says that you should. Stay away from this place I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh (m') - 1. (n.) A multi-purpose response, primarily used to imply a degree of indifference. Tone of voice and circumstance often implies a meaning. Can be used when you don't want to answer an awkward or embarrassing question, or if you just plain have nothing else to say, and you want the other person to interpret the \"meh\" however he/she chooses. As in: Q: \"What do you think of my new dress?\" A: \"Meh.\" or Q: \"What do you want to do tonight?\" A: \"Meh.\"

2. Shoeless Joe's North York.

It's got beer.  Pub food - most of it probably from frozen.  A few TVs."}
{"text":"\"Have you been to this place, Shoeless Joes?  They have AMAZING beers, as well as some of the best mussels I've ever had.\"   Me.

\"Um, no... You're thinking of SMOKELESS Joes.  Shoeless Joe's is crap.\" Random Person.

So I spent more than a year in TO avoiding this place because of this slanderous individual.  Last week I finally got my chance to try it out.  

While I'm no expert, I thought the wings were quite good! If you take this place for what it is, it's not bad at all.  There are booths with individual screens and.... well, what else is there to say? It's a sports bar.  

Someone vomited in the washroom as well."}
{"text":"I like the idea of having another good sized sports bar in the area, but service was nothing special and the food was really disappointing. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to watch a game!!
Arrived at the place at 1 pm to watch the champions league final. The lady working there confirmed that they are showing the game and seated us. Around 2 they switched our tv into a baseball game and when we requested to change it back to the soccer game a guy came and asked us if its only 2 of us, when we said yes he said this table is reserved and i have to move u to the bar. He moved us to a very bad place where you have to bend your neck in order to see the tv and when i told him i don't like that place and i need to move he told me in a very rude way \" thats all we have \" and walked away before i even continue talking.
Extremely rude and very disrespectful. 
Will never ever return back to this place"}
{"text":"2 weeks ago, 
Have visited in the past often
they must have undergone a management change, as current manager has no concept of public service. unlike weeks prior

familiar waitress no longer there, pleasent,  very low top quite revealing, quite busty, would not bring date or ladies there

will not return , a lot better places to drink close by"}
{"text":"Terrible food
white trash hang out"}
{"text":"Dear Joe: Why are you shoeless? I mean, the prices at your establishment are pretty high for what you get -- you really should channel some of that profit into buying yourself some kicks. Just sayin', Joe.

ANYWAY. I rolled into Shoeless Joe's with my husband and couple of school chums to watch a UFC match. There are booths with individual TV screens, or if you weren't lucky enough to snag one, there are PLENTY of screens around so you won't have to crane your neck too far to see. Decently-sized bar area, too. For such a crowded night, the service was pretty decent. The food is typical chain-eatertainment fare: wings (pretty good, many sauce options), pastas, pizzas, deep fried appetizers. On the other hand, the drinks were weak  and my Caesar wasn't anything to write home about (though the pepperoni-stick garnish was a nice touch). 

Shoeless Joe's is just A-OK. Poor Joe. Get yourself some shoes -- you'll get tetanus running around barefoot."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar especially to catch UFC"}
{"text":"I want to give Shoeless Joe's a higher rating because the waitress was friendly.  However, the food is just not up to it.

Food:
- Fish & chip - the fish was big but heavily breaded & not fresh.  The deep fried fish was fishy, and the fries were old
- Chicken enchilada: - this was decent on small size

Extra Positive:
- Open late on a Sat. night
- Even late the waitress was friendly and positive"}
{"text":"The awning out front is faded and ripped, the interior is mostly clean but has definitely seen better days. The place needs an upgrade for sure. I ordered calamari to start which was very rubbery then planko battered chicken which was tough and dry. The meal came with veggies and mashed potatoes and I confirmed the mash was made from frozen potatoes. Frozen potatoes?? It was barely edible and I'm pretty sure the veggies were from frozen, too. My husband had pasta which wasn't too bad. My meal was pretty bad and I'm not even that picky but this place is just not up to par, I could have just heated up frozen chicken fingers at home and saved myself the money.
Terrible."}
{"text":"Place is kind of isolated but amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff. Wings were pretty damn good. waitress was quick with orders and quicking in on us. Main Course was amazing as well. I ordered 2 pieces of fish and chip. Was stuffed to the gill :)"}
{"text":"Burgers, Beer and more. I had an appetizer Steak Kabab. The meat was tender and deliciously spiced and came with a yummy coconut dipping sauce ! 
They were also very nice and substituted rice for the noodles it was supposed to come with, thereby accommodating my non gluten, non dairy diet. SO... big yay for that :-)"}
{"text":"This place ruined my night, terrible service. None of the drinks showed up within thirty minutes. The place was basically empty so it's not like they are too busy. It took around an hour for three appetisers to show up. They brought the check before any of the food showed up, and were incapable of splitting it. Honestly this place doesn't even deserve a single star. Please don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"For a sports bar I have to say the decor and the equipment is a bit dated. The main TV is using a projector but it wasn't even high definition and it was incredibly blurry like I was watching 3D without the glasses. Maybe it was an off night because of the rain but compared with pretty much all other sports bars I'm pretty sure HD is the standard now.

Business was slow considering it was a Game 5 Raptors game but it did make the service much quicker and attentive.  

Wed is rib night for $20.99 - You get a full rack of fall off the bone ribs with either a side of fries or salad. Waitress recommended the hickory sauce and it was delicious.

1lb of wings with a side of fries or salad was about $13.99 and just the wings alone was $10.99 - the dry Cajun rub and honey garlic were the flavors we went with and both were great.

There are definitely better bars out there for game nights but if you want a joint where its not as packed and looking for some nice comfort food then this is the place for you. 

Ribs were really good so I give it an extra 0.5

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I was meeting a good friend downtown, and he suggested this place, as it is his \"local.\" I figured personal recommendations trump all, so I was happy to oblige. 

It's a chain, but it seems to be a pretty quality chain. The service was excellent and attentive, with our server pouring our beer without us even noticing. We shared a pitcher of Rickard's Red, my friend had some wings, and I had the Crispy Asian Chicken Bites, which were essentially an appetizer sized serving of mini boneless wings.

Food was good, I would put it above average to an American chain restaurant for sure, hence my 4 star rating. I'd certainly go back if I was in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible lunch experience. Soggy lettuce, frozen salads, wraps that are not grilled and dirty napkins and cutlery. You have lost our business."}
{"text":"There Tuesday night around dinner hour with three in the party (one man, two women). Place was not busy. Extremely poor service. We had to seat ourselves, After more than 20 minutes of waiting, finally went into the kitchen to find a server. Orders were very basic - one soup and salad, and two burgers. Despite this, the food took a very long time to come once ordered. It was okay, nothing special. Bill also took some time. Found the wait staff outfits unnecessarily revealing (to the point of being offensive).  Wish the owners put more emphasis on great service and great food and less emphasis on wait staff as bimbos on the half shell. It's 2014, boys. Clearly not designed to be welcoming to female clientele. This one won't bother going back."}
{"text":"I've been in to this Shoeless Joe's location a couple of times now, and have had a decent experience here every time. The waitresses are attractive and scantily clad, and generally offer good service. The food is a tad on the expensive side and is your typical bar food. They do have some interesting drinks that you wouldn't find in your typical bar, but they aren't anything special. The wings are solid, though. I'd go with those if you are trying the place out."}
