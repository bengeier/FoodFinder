{"text":"everything is overpriced. the food takes forever every time and the servers are understaffed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times, although not always by choice.  I had the fish and chips once, and the fish tasted ... weird.  Like it had some spice or curry on it.  I've also had two different pasta dishes.  The pasta's not bad, but the portions are massive (like 3 meals worth), and it's basically like pasta that I can make at home (mediocre) instead of a pasta that I usually get at restaurants.  If you take the leftovers home with you, it's not bad value for money, but it's just generally not great food.   The service is unpredictable.  When I came with a group of 7, the service was really slow.  We were on a time limit, with only an hour and 15 minutes to eat, and we had to phone to push back our afternoon meetings.  The waitress also forgot to include the order of one of the people at our table, so only 6 of us got our meals, and then we had to wait extra time for the last person's meal to come (in a box, so he could eat it after we left).  Sometimes it also takes a while to get seated since there are often so few people eating (and the restaurant is so big) that there isn't always any host around to seat you or take drink orders.   Another time, we came for beers and fries, which were all fine, but then the restaurant was closing at 6:00.  We've also planned to go to Rex's for lunch, only to find that it was closed.  The hours are pretty unpredictable, and change with the campus semester schedule."}
{"text":"My first time experience was ordering chicken fingers which costed around $8 for two pieces. It was really dry and definitely not worth it. I also tried the chicken sharwma poutine couple of times but it is never consistent. Service was decent but at times very slow even when it isn't busy. Their menue is extensive but it is pretty pricy to eat here."}
{"text":"Poor menu selection. Poor quality and quantity of food.   Rex used to be good in the old days but now after since they changed management over and over. It's not a place that people looking forward to hang out anymore.   Highlight: tall boy Tuesday and usually good service.  Dislike: food and music selection in the diner."}
{"text":"Great food, fries from here are the best i've ever had. Occasionally they'll run out of this and serve what i believe to just be a cheap one they had on hand just in case. Lots of choices with daily specials. Costs are a little pricey but the quality of food you get is way better than the price you paid."}
{"text":"The menu options are pretty expensive (for a restaurant located inside a campus) but they're pretty good. I think they should resize their food portions tho, especially that most their customers are (physically conscious) students, because the portions are HUGE.  I've been here so many times and I find that their dishes aren't very consistent. The Chicken Kashmir for instance had so much sauce, I thought it was this super salty soup surrounding the rice, when I ordered it once. The next time I had it, the same sauce were just brushed on the sides of the plate, which then made me realize it was just sauce. bleh. Their service seems to be faster during dinner hours. Because whenever I'd go there for lunch almost every week last year, it takes about half hour to 45 minutes before the food arrives."}
{"text":"They've got good seating area and booths. Service is friendly. Food tastes old and takes a while to come, sometimes over 20 minutes -_-  The food portions are small and overpriced, although it's nice to know their meat is halal.  They've got good nachos though and board games  Good place to go w group of friends but nothing special."}
{"text":"Please stay away from this place if you can, and I should take my own advice next time too. As everyone have said before me, the wait times are ridiculous, and on top of that the kitchen mixes up orders all the time. It has happened twice to me already.  The prices are quite high considering it's a campus pub. And the prices keep increasing every year too. They don't even give you proper utensils, just stuffs everything into a plastic takeout box.  The food is hit and miss. The shawarma poutine is good most of the times (sometimes the quality/taste is inconsistent, and they miss an ingredient here and there) but with all the cons, please decide for yourself if it's worth it...  The opening hours are inconsistent. They say one thing on the website and another in person.  If it wasn't for the fact that the campus is in the middle of nowhere, I would've gone somewhere else to eat a long time ago."}
{"text":"Went here to see a friend perform at a cabert style night. Looking at the very limited beer selection, I asked the bartender if a particular beer is hoppy. He said he has no idea, he's never tried it. Now I may be crazy out of line here, but when you have like 7 beer options, isn't it reasonable to assume your bartender has some knowledge? It gave me a giggle."}
{"text":"This place isn't awful for a campus pub. They should really expand their menu, and fix the prices... I overall really enjoy the food - a little on the salty side, but that might just be me.   Their drinks are pretty good. I tend to opt for the Long Island iced tea hahah. The wine is fair.   I would suggest that they fix their opening hours as everyone does tell you different things (i.e. Website, in person, google, etc).   Major problem: the regular poutine. It states (VEG) with a leaf, but uses BEEF gravy. Please fix and update this.   Lastly, the t-shirts with \"tipping is sexy,\" really? Seriously? Idk I personally hate them and makes me want to tip less."}
