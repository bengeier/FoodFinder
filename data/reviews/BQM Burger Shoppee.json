{"text":"I stop by for a Riverside Burger (onion ring, garlic aioli, BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon) about once a week. Always stellar. I'd choose Burger Shoppe over Burger Priest any day."}
{"text":"It's a good thing I don't have a lot of money because I'd eat here all of the time and eventually require a wall removed and forklift to leave my house. That would put a crimp in my takeout game.   The food is delicious and the people who work here are great. Sure, you're not going to be in and out of here in McDonalds time, but the payoff is so worth it.   Skip Dangerous Dan's with their passive aggressive signs and gigantic burgers that taste like nothing. Unless we're talking about rice, quality always wins over quantity and BQM hasn't let me down yet."}
{"text":"Ate at BQM the past 2 Friday evenings.  After hitting some balls at the range, thought I'd head out for a heartly dinner in one of my favorite areas of Toronto, Riverdale-Leslieville.  The quality of the burgers were really good, and the fries were excellent.  I'd go back again. My only complaint is the time in took to receive my order.  The first visit, they were busy and I was behind a fairly big order. The food took almost 30 minutes.  The second time, not so busy and I received my order in what I consider an appropriate amount of time.  Well worth the regular wait, not sure if it's worth the 30 minute wait.  Great food nonetheless."}
{"text":"Tough critics, first off I'm a total carnivore that have had burgers from mom and pop joints, McDs, Licks, Burger Priest .... and what governs my decisions and reviews is simple accuracy and flavor.  Accuracy in that you can get my burger done correctly every time and still have that same flavor that kept me coming back for more.  I've probably eaten here a good 14 times in the last year and a half, and I live in the burbs not downtown so thats saying something.    Reviewers say this place is trying to cash in on the gourmet burger craze but is nothing special .... I say these people are idiots that complain for a living.    If you think this place is nothing special take a look at their menu and tell me which other places gives you the choice cut of meat for you burger?  Um they do, Chuck , Brisket or Sirloin .... oh and you can cook it the way you would eat a steak (though I don't think they do blue, I don't eat blue).  Haters will say but that doesn't change the flavor, hell yeah it does --- unless you been eating steak and foie gras in your daily life, then I'll understand why flavors escape you.  Blue Cheese, Smoked White Cheddar, Pineapple, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Pears, Roasted Red Peppers, Jalapenos, Portobello mushrooms, fried egg, garlic aioli , chipotle aioli, dijon....  Menu: http://burgershoppe.com/images/menus/Diner_menu_2011.pdf  Most would say oh but any Gourmet Burger place worth their salt would have these ingredients ... and you'd be right, but its not whats in your pantry its how you use it.  The different burger combos are gold, simple gold.  Their fries are fish & chips style with skin, amazing (though a bigger portion would be appreciated).  Their onion rings are fantastic, I think they use Japanese bread crumbs cause its not the heavy oil soaked batter that most places use.  Its crispy, light, with good onion flavor not overpowering, still fried so a bit oily but not half as much as its old batter'ed cousin.  Now do I finish off this great meal with a pint of Sapporo or a glass bottle of Coke,  I dunno what it is but there is something to the way coke cools in a glass bottle and tastes that just can't duplicated in plastic.  And I really applaud a burger joint for offering Sapporo, nice crisp, clean taste that cools you down and not harsh aftertaste.... just lingering flavor of the burger you just ate.  This place granted looks like a shoebox but its got heart, so all the haters can suck it.  Though I will say this if the owner is reading, accordian style glass front so when its summer you can open it up and have a flow from the patio to inside seemlessly.  EDIT: 07/18/2014   Man this place has gone downhill...they used have the choice of ordering sirloin burger, but they took that off the menu.  The last two times I came here just got worse.  Don't bother going here anymore.... I'll give it maybe one star, at the most!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Nice meat. Make sure to try the Riverdale burger with onion ring. Lot's of options for sides as well. Wish the would have fountain Coke tho."}
{"text":"Gross cooking practices. Went here one time (will never return) during lunch (wasn't busy, two other patrons besides me) and the same bloke cooked and took money without once washing his hands.  He then took a dirty rag that hasn't seen bleach ever and wiped down the prep counter before grabbing the burger buns, of course without washing his grimey paws. When called out on his unsafe cooking, he became red-faced and quickly rinsed his hands. Too late."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is fine, but I just can't help comparing it unfavourably to local competitor Dangerous Dans.  There's a great choice of burgers on the menu, some of which are very tasty,but none of which have completely blown me away.  The service I find unfriendly and impolite. Not sure why Dangerous Dans gets so much flack for their service compared to this place?   The food is good but I probably won't be giving this place another chance when bigger, better and cheaper burgers can be found a few doors down.  Solid 3/5"}
{"text":"The Shoppe Burger will change your life. The end."}
{"text":"The Burger Shoppe (BQM) on Queen at. E. West of Broadview in Leslieville has my support for -THE BEST- burgers in the city, hands down, no questions asked.   The guys that run the small store are awesomely friendly and in the spirit of great customer service, will chat you up as they make your hormone free, steroid free burger in front of your eyes. The range of burgers they have on the board is simply impressive, from the standard to the more quintessentially interesting. The burgers literally taste \"chemical free\" and in this world , it's an awesome awesome alternative from so many mundane and processed garbage hamburger joints out there.  Make sure you get a dose if fries with your combo; the French fries are as natural and tasty as the 5/5 burgers. So delicious!!!   Sometimes they are very busy especially during a Saturday but that doesn't matter. They are fast, efficient, and move along quickly.  Don't walk out; just wait a few minutes trust me.   Do NOT pass this place up in Leslieville if you have a hankering for real, non-chemically hamburgers. The ownership may have changed recently (summer 2014) bit don't be worried: it had not effected the unbelievable quality of the food at Burger Shoppe. --- A MUST GO FOR BURGER LOVERS ---!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where one can let one's nuts hang.  It was freaking cold and I needed to warm up and charge my phone (there are two available outlets to do so, one on either side of the relatively small seating area), and I kindve wanted to eat, so I stepped inside Burger Shoppe. I ordered the banquet burger combo-special from a guy with dreads and a bunch of tatts. He had a really warm personality and smile,  the kindve guy that would be a side character in an HBO show,  a kindve badass with a daughter he does everything for,  and that audiences LOVE.  I realized they were playing Thug Life- 2Pac's old group- over the sound system and I was like OH SH*T I haven't heard this outside my own speakers, nor even that way, in FOREVERRRRR!!!! I immediately had respect for the place. Although I later determined it was actually just a lesser known older 2Pac song (Thug Life in spirit, not name) which I also hadn't heard for a while, the place remained somewhat cool in my eyes.  Then I noticed the TV- they were playing an ultimate fighting match- a sport I've always wished I had the friends and time to get into. Soon the guys were fiddling with the channels and i realized they have some sort of 'fight cable package' with like, A LOT of different fight-spectating options. I imagine it would be cool to have a group of friends who all wanted to watch a fight down there in that tiny a** place, eating and watching said fight. Although I'm not sure they serve alcohol.   Both the burger and fries were actually quite good, I'd say a solid four stars. Overall I'm going to stay with that four, because the place is a little awkward and small."}
{"text":"Not really worth the time...burger was way over cocked! More like burned unfortunately. I asked the cook for his recommendation and he suggested the Riverside. Totally dry and lacks flavour. Too bad I have was hoping I'll find a good burger joint close to home."}
{"text":"RIVERDALE - Nothing beats this place for a burger - but only the Queen East & Broadview BQM really rocks.  I mainly go to burgers for the simple taste of beef, so the great quality natural meat and perfect preparation are key. I order The Works (standard toppings) on a Natural Burger and it's affordable amazing food. This is burger heaven, and the place is even ugly, but they sure worked out their consistency issues they may have had long ago.  There's 'options' - oo-ee-ahh. Enough good-quality toppings for those seeking novelty, but I don't care, see comment above. I'm not having a damn pizza. Best 'upgrade' is a double 4oz in place of a single 6 oz. Either sizing is good though.  Side Note: The Ossington location BQM is just a mediocre bar, offering burgers with unnecessary meat cut selections that range from pricey to ridiculous. I'd skip it. If I want to pay $$$ for a steak-worthy cut I sure as hell won't eat it ground up with condiments, just to impress myself.  Nope, the hole-in-the-wall place at Queen and Broadview is a great, well-priced and consistent establishment that seems to be very well run these days. I will happily drive there from the Beach and ignore The Burgers Griest as I pass right by..."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times before. The last three times we have tried to go they have been sold out of the veggie burger.  The last time I was about to give my order and the guy asked me to wait a second while he answered the phone.  He sold the last veggie burger to the person on the phone, despite the fact that I was there first cash in hand.    Yesterday we called ahead to be sure theory had a veggie burger left. When we got there I ordered my burger and paid $1 for avocado to be added to it.  When I got my burger there was a tiny pice of avocado on it. Roughly 1/8 th of a small avocado, when we asked the guy gave us another tiny piece.    They seem to be really understaffed, which led to a mess up with the fries we ordered.  When we got our actual fries they were over cooked.  Also they forgot the bacon on my boyfriend's burger, and he had to wait for the bacon to be cooked.   The lack of staff seems to weigh on the one person working which results in a poor customer experience.  Also there is no way to contact the owner listed on the website. I tried sending a message via Facebook with no response.    Too bad.  With so many good burger places around it won't be hard to find a new place to go."}
{"text":"Meh. We got takeaway Banquet Combos (eat-in atmo definitely off-putting). Server refused to upgrade one of the combos to sweet potato fries, even when we offered to pay more, saying \"the owner never allows substitutions.\"  Okay, you're not a Michelin star restaurant, so.  Patty was charcoal-y and over-cooked which actually enhanced overall flavour of the burger. Cheese wasn't real cheddar (cheese slice, at best). Fries were slightly anemic. If you're craving a juicy, full-flavoured burger, I'd give it a miss. If all you're looking for is a meh burger, it's fine. Just don't get anything with cheese."}
{"text":"Haven't had a beef burger but the veggie burgers are the best I've found in Toronto - I have mine with garlic aioli. Fries are excellent. Good selection of soft drinks."}
{"text":"Not the best burger but not the worse. I've been a few times because it is close to where I live and it is not McDonalds. Until I find b and it does seem a bit better than their location on Ossington. Until someone tells me of a better place,  this place will do. The fries are good, the service is friendly but clearly always understaffed and what frustrates me more is the close early almost every night. The sign says 9 pm but don't try to place an order after 8:30. If they are not going to offer full service to 9 pm then they shouldn't say open until 9 pm. Other than upsetting late comers I don't see the advantage to this practice."}
{"text":"Tried Burger Shoppe for the first time. I should clarify that I had the chicken burger, not a beef burger. My order for a simple double patty with no cheese, no fries  and no drink came to $17. I'm not normally someone to complain about pricing, but that is silly. The worst part is that the chicken was dry and had almost zero flavour. I will try a beef burger next, but as for this one, it was a fail."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The burgers were okay, I had a cheese burger and the meat was tasty, fresh tasting and not greasy which I appreciated, if anything the burger as a whole was on the drier side.   My beef was that we were there on a Friday night and they were shutting down at 8:30? (The sign outside clearly states they close at 9). We were told we could order our food to go, but I'm in no mood to squeeze tiny packets of ketchup.  I loved the fries here but they were really skimpy on that and our 2 small bags of fries was shy of 3/4 full. C'mon man, we got 2 combos and even tipped on take out. Places like these discourage me from tipping on takeout orders in the future. I felt like a sucker.  BQM you know you can do better than this!"}
{"text":"The food here is fine and the toppings are quality. The portions are smallish. But taste is really great!  But my coworkers and I have had to stop patronizing because we cannot be in and out with take out in under 20-25 minutes. We've all given it several chances but something is always amiss. The cash register is acting up. They're short staffed. And whoever is in there never seems to have the foresight to address a problem before lunch. Or, owners or management with the skills to do so aren't making themselves available. It's not the cooking time.  Staff do things like wait until your burger is cooked, wrapped, bagged, and paid for before barely remembering to tell you they were out of two of the toppings.   All this aside, bottom line: Takes. For. Ever. Don't blame the staff, just get someone in to look at how you are preparing the food, how the staff interact with customers - your order-to-serve process - and fix it. Look at the lunch process of some higher traffic burger establishments and learn what you can. We want to start coming back!!"}
{"text":"Ughh, I dunno.  Completely on the fence with this place.  Was excited after eating at the BQM Diner on Queen, and since I couldn't get the delicious flavour of burger out of my mouth I decided to hit up Burger Shoppe for lunch the next day.  I ordered the Riverside, which I knew was a risk.  Very rarely are onion ring burgers successful because they have so much batter and are rather dry.  But I decided to go with it anyways since I was coming off a serious burger high the night before.  When it finally arrived, I was impressed by it's appearance.  It certainly looked delicious.   A tad tall which always complicates eating burgers, but that's one of them good problems I suppose.  First couple bites were exactly what I expected.  Bun, some meat, onion ring and not much else. The meat itself was well prepared and juicy, but overall dry.   At about 35%, the burger finally presented what it was all about.  Good tangy-ness, good crunch to the onion ring, soft burger patty but ultimately falling short of a great sandwich.  I felt it was lacking something - a 3rd heat, something to catch me by surprise me while eating it.  The fries were very meh.  My combo was pricey, would've got a milkshake if it weren't an additional $5 on top of my $13.    Disappointing, cuz I was really excited about this place.   Good not great, but I wanted something more."}
{"text":"It's average, It had good favour, I went with riverside burger which was decent. The batter on onion ring was my only issue  Thou for 6 onze patty, felt on the light side. It was good but probably a place I won't return since its nothing special not because it was a bad burger"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like BQM but twice the Riverside location has messed up my order. On my last visit, I ordered a Shoppe chicken burger - seems simple enough. When I got home, I found a completely different sandwich - pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard ... no goat cheese, chipotle aioli or Carmelites onions. What gives?? I think they're understaffed - there was only one person taking orders and payment, cooking food and packaging it.   As for the food, it was just okay. The chicken was moist and the bun to patty ratio was good. The fries are thick cut and okay as well. But I find it unacceptable to mess up orders so badly. For the prices they're charging, I'll be going up the street to Burger Stomper - their burgers are comparable and they haven't messed up an order yet."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is good.  The fries are really nice, and the burgers are delicious.  That being said the service is utterly terrible, and horrible service is enough to taint even the most delicious of meals.  My boyfriend wandered over one afternoon to pick up lunch while I was out.  He has very specific food requirements (more preference than necessity) but he always makes sure his orders are very clear and to the point.  The guy running the shop that particular day completely ignored my boyfriend's request for a plain cheeseburger; he made him a burger with the works, charged him for it (it cost more than his actual choice), and when my boyfriend requested a new burger be made to his specifications, the guy making the burger told him that it was \"too bad\" and he wouldn't be making a new one.  Where is the customer service in that?  You messed up.  Fix the burger.  Also, what if the reason behind his order was based on allergies or food sensitivities rather than preference?  The unwillingness to make a new burger meant that my boyfriend payed for a meal that he couldn't eat, which is completely unacceptable.  The employees here act like they are doing you a favour when you go in to order something to eat.  You run a restaurant in the service industry.  Learn what that means.  We were both willing to pay the slightly higher-than-average price for good food and mediocre service.  Dipping below mediocrity and treating your patronage like trash means we'll never set foot in there again.  UPDATE: Shortly after writing my original review, the owner wrote me with an apology, which was greatly appreciated.  I thanked him, but the damage was already done.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Two of us spent $30.00.  Virtually no seating.  I don't like the burger to be pink in the centre.  Next time I will ask for well done.   Someone mentioned that BSQM is not as good as Craft Burger; unfortunately they are not even as good as Lick's.  If your in this neighbourhood and you are flush with cash BSQM does make a pretty good burger."}
{"text":"When it first opened up it WAS great...However, the quality and size has diminished so much so I have stopped going."}
{"text":"Once a year guilty pleasure. Cheeseburger in a gluten free bun with caramelised onions and fries. As is often the case, the bun was dry but the rest very flavourful. Spartan decor is appropriate and the host was appropriately no nonsense. I'll be back next year. :-)"}
{"text":"I heard alot about the Burger Shoppe and decided to try it. All I can say is that it was a huge let down. I got there just  after noon and there wasn't many other customers so service was fast. I ordered the shoppe burger combo (around $14) which I thought was very over priced. The burger was bland and the \"caramelized onions\" were horrible. The fries were above average but that wasn't enough to make up for the disappointing burger. For the price this place is a rip off."}
{"text":"Since my work requires an hour-long commute from the west to east end of the city (a commute that's depressingly equal to the one from my family home in rural western Ontario), not much take-out food survives the trek back...with the exception of the Burger Shoppe. Not only are their burgers able to withstand distance, but their tastiness also survives (much to my boyfriend's bemusement) a stop at the eaton centre and tanning salon along the way. The burgers are freshly made (not frozen) to order, so it's not fast-food (a common complaint) so much as it is great take-out. I've only had to wait max 15 minutes and the staff has always been polite and courteous, coming outside to hand me my order when it's done. When I first started going they didn't offer half-as many toppings as they do now, and the new additions (such as horseradish, caramelized onions) are great. Their offerings of cheese toppings (smoked white cheddar, etc.) are especially yummy. On the downside the burger combos are a little pricey and the very greasy sides do NOT survive the ride home (and can leave quite unfortunate stain on your pants). But overall the place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Burger Shoppe's food is great - if you can get it. Juicy burgers have great toppings and the atmosphere's relaxed. It's good enough that I'm willing to spend $10 for a combo.  Too bad service sucks. The chalkboard menu has milk shakes on it, but they've been out of ice cream for 2 months. How hard is it to buy ice cream??? There are tons of corner stores in the area and at $4.50 a shake, clearly there's profit to be made. Also, last time we were there with friends, we had to wipe down our own dirty table. WTF??  To conclude, great food, but bad service/stupid management."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood go-to place for a burger. The yummy staple burgers served at the west-end BQM diners, available here in this east-end takeout joint.  Burgers are made-to-order, so don't expect quick fast-food-chain paced service. There are also a couple of small tables if you rather eat in (personally, I like to run off to nearby Joel Weeks Park and eat there).  My main complaint is that the prices are a tad high for a takeout-style establishment (though no single item over $10). For whatever reason, that doesn't deter me from continuously coming back for some satisfying down-the-block comfort food, especially when it involves goat cheese or blue cheese.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar or the 504 to Queen/Broadview.}"}
{"text":"Three stars plus one for the act of kindness they showed.   So many burgers, so little room in the waistline of my jeans. My burger quest continues this time out in the Riverdale neighbourhood. It was lunch, I was hungry, I needed quick and figured since it'd only been a couple of days from when I huffed back my last burger I could go for some cow on a bun. I looked east, I looked west and then decided on BSQM. Momma loves her burgers and I hadn't hit up this spot yet.   BSQM is about the size of my kitty-kat's condo, it's literally a shoebox, much like that of GBC. It's mostly about the takeout with seating for about a dozen or so. I sidled up to the cash register to order, opened up my wallet and discovered a missing debit card (insert the music from the shower scene in Psycho). Oh no. All I I had on me was a ten dollar bill. Prior reviews have noted that this place ain't cheap so Momma had some decisions to make. Something had to go. Today it was going to be the fries (sob).   I ordered a four ounce burger with goats cheese & caramelized onions with a cold drink. That cashed out at just over $9 bucks. The guy behind the cash asked me if I wanted fries and I tried hard to fight back the tears, took a deep breath and said \"sorry dude, my debit card is MIA and all I've got is this tenner.\" Order was placed and I plunked myself down in a corner, all the while cursing the missing green piece of plastic that came between me and my golden spuds. It was an even more bitter pill to swallow as I watched two guys next to me inhaling their basket of fries.   The burger was decent. A bit chewy but edges were caramelized and the goat cheese added a lovely edge of sublime tang. These onions are not caramelized, they are simply sauteed with lots of pepper in them. The burger was pink in the middle as the juice ran out of it and I like this.   So the extra star...ok, well I'm sitting eating my burger and the order taker guy plunks a basket of fries on my table and says \"here ya go girl...enjoy them!\". Now that's an act of kindness that I can get down with! The fries were really hot, crispy and well cooked. Maybe they just tasted better because of the kindness they were delivered with.   As it turns out that wasn't the only act of kindness I witnessed during lunch. A young gal came in, having some bicycle lock issues and she asks the guys there if they can give her a drop of cooking oil and she explains her kryptonite lock is giving her fits. A minute later a young guy emerges from the back with a little plastic cup of oil and off she goes. She pops back in, all smiles, holding up her bike lock.   While the burgs may seem pricey this place has tons of really good burger karma. They sure know how to treat a gal well.  As usual pics attached."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times were just average, so so. They are aiming for that \"specialty\" burger type of shop, but their burgers are not special. Just average tasting, pricey and limited in selection.   The fries are better than average, but to walk away with a burger and fries, no drink, you are looking at at $12.  Still a better option than Dangerous Dan's though."}
{"text":"I think the burgers here are great - the meat tastes fresh...like real meat.  They have a burger option that has one of their giant onion rings on it (yum), and something with goat's cheese.  Everytime I've ordered here it's been delicious.  I love that they have a giant container of fresh cut fries that they fry on demand!  Who can ask for anything more?  It's worth the walk past queen and broadview!"}
{"text":"i have to disagree with the review that talks about burgers as fast food and lumps this place into that company.  if you want fast food, go get it at mcd's.  youll receive a burger (if indeed you can call it that from mcd's) in a couple of minutes.  the specific deal with this store is that it is not fast food - it takes a good 12-15 minutes for your burger to be made, with care;  to be adorned with ingredients that are not run of the mill - how many fast food places will top your burger with portobello mushrooms?  their homemade bbq sauce?  goat cheese? blue cheese? even jalapeno peppers?.    not to mention that all the beef is 6oz of all natural beef without anitbiotics and hormones.  better to pay the 10 bucks for something that is tastier, better for you than alternative beef burger choices.  rate mcdonalds with burger king with kfc with pizza pizza -  with lowest common denominator places.  not with places that spend more to make an effort to put a better product out.  now i had a riverside burger which was a 6oz all natural beef patty covered with mozarella (real not processed), a large onion ring, their bbq sauce, bacon and a bun.  it was pretty good, the bbq sauce very tasty and tangy, the bacon grilled to perfection, the burger itself a little less juicy than i would have preferred but the package as a whole quite tasty.  no fries for me that day but i have had them and they were well done, not too thick, not too skinny and crispy.  the shoppe itself has a few tables and some bar stools to sit down on.  the stools are by the window so people can see the sauces and oil slithering onto your face as you eat.    so i say, if you are already going to have the burger and fry meal  (which we all know in general is not good for you, your body that is) pay a little extra, eat good meat, fresh, tasty (for a burger) gourmet ingredients and enjoy that occasional red meat experience well...because you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"we went to poutineville the next day, and I way preferred this.   so far this is our favourite poutine in toronto, hands down.  edit: came here again the other day and reaffirmed my decision that the palmer poutine is the best poutine in toronto. the cheese also melts better than any other i've found!  simpler poutine is so much better than all this fancy stuff you can get most places."}
{"text":"It was the day after New Year's Eve.  My friend was hungover and we were in search of greasy food.  After searching on yelp.ca, we decided to head to BQM for burgers and poutine.    The restaurant is a tiny little diner-like place.  My friend ordered a burger (I forgot which one), and I ordered myself a Palmer poutine: bacon, carmelized onion, gravy and fries.  How can a girl say no to that?!  It was absolutely delicious and not too heavy.  My friend ordered a side of onion rings later on.  They were huge - and I could literally slip it onto my wrist (I have a picture to prove this); however, they weren't the best.  They tasted quite bland.  Service wasn't the greatest either.  They were friendly, but the food took FOREVER to come out.  Overall, food was fairly good - service was so-so.  However, a great place for greasy food if you're craving it after a night of debauchery."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I can't say I agree about the Dangerous Dan's comment, you can TASTE the MUCH higher quality in Burger Shoppe burgers... The buns are nice and soft and the burgers are juicy, mmmm.... This is definitely my neighbourhood go-to burger joint!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are great. But, Gourmet Burger Co. is just across the Don on Parliament. Go there instead. If you don't go to GBC instead, it takes a while to get served, but there is a bit of seating and the burgers are quite good. The Organic version isn't much better than the regular version. Get the caramelized onions. The fries are good, and the sweet potato fries are good too. The onion rings are good. Maybe a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"average quality of burger, 8-9$. Refuses to give me tap water so you have to buy drinks from them."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this little burger joint for months now, and I'm so glad I got the chance to stop in this afternoon. After a full day at Toronto Island, I came back to the east end famished. I ordered the 4-ounce Cheeseburger with the works and a small side of fries. The service was fast and my meal cost under $10, tax and tip in. The food hit the spot: the bun was eggy and fresh, the fries were crisp and sea-salted. Since I was with my dog, I ordered my food to go, and the gentleman working the grill was kind enough to bring my food to me while I waited outside. My suggestion to others would be not to be picky: order the cheeseburger with the works, let the grillman do his thang and I'm certain you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"I think there was a change of ownership at this place, although I am not sure but the quality seems to have gone down since I first went in 2010.  The place looks like it's deteriorating as there has been little upkeep since it was open.  The service has taken a nosedive too.  The order taker is grumpy and doesn't care about what you order... just no love in this place.   No wi-fi, or at least they don't want to share their password with you.  I'd eat their burger, but it's got nothing on some of the other burger places that have joined the gourmet burger market in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to Burger Shoppe today to 'Try it Again' because I didn't like it the first time I ate there.  I pretty much stand by my original assessment - it is REALLY expensive, not that great and the service is painful.  Let's start with the good things: (a) They have a lot of gourmet toppings, and they are fresh (b) It is pretty close to my house (maybe not a huge positive for you :) ) (c) They always get a few of the 'other' fries in my fries - a couple white fries in my sweet potato fries or vice versa - I really like that a lot (easily amused I guess)  Now let's move on to why I won't be eating here again: (a) My burger/fries/pop combo was $14.01 - I see the other reviews below, that this is not fast food, it's fresh, good quality ingredients... that's all well and good, but 14$ is TOO MUCH for a burger and fries, no matter how you cut it.  Last time I ate here was on my birthday, and for two of us to eat is was 30$.  And BBQ sauce costs 25c.  Relish is 35c.  Bacon is TWO DOLLARS (you do get a LOT of bacon). (b) I find it difficult to communicate with the guy who works there.  I order from the menu, but I don't want cheese, and I don't ask for any weird substitutions... both times my order has been incorrect and he has had a really hard time taking it.  How hard is it to do no cheese no mayo. (c) I have to keep harping on the price man... It's not nearly as good as craft burger on King W, and they're less expensive (but don't have bacon).  I will never eat here again, I would rather get Dangerous Dan's takeout anyday.  Burger Shoppe does have a decent sweet potato fry though, if the truth must be told."}
{"text":"My usual stop after climbing at TCA. Memories. Love this place though I believe they recently started charging for their chipotle sauce. I just can't look at them the same. They have a sign that says that they welcome suggestions and to email the manager/owner/whatevs but my friend and I both emailed him asking him to bring back the veggie burger that is made with nuts and beets because it's higher quality than a slab of deep fried tofu but we got no response. Needless to say the deep-fried slab of tofu still exists today. I don't like the way they run the business, it seems like they're in it just for the money and only pretend to acknowledge their customers' concerns and comments. With that style, I'd rather go to Craft Burger and Gourmet Burger Company."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the burgers here.  Yes, some are a little pricey, but for $5, you can get the baby burger which I find more than enough for lunch.  Maybe it's not the most exciting burger on the face of the planet, but in its simplicity, it is quite tasty.  And the ingredients are very fresh too.  The problem with this place recently is their fries.  Three times in the not too distant past I've decided to splurge, go crazy, and order fries.  Three times, they have been so under cooked that I could not eat them.  Sacrilege!!!  I have not given up hope entirely.  I remember having some fairly spectacular sweet potato fries here back when it first opened.  Let's hope BQM steps up its game and reclaims its deep frying prowess."}
{"text":"My husband ordered their Shoppe burger with lamb, and I had their BQM burger with chuck.  The burger bun itself was fine, and the meat patty was cooked well but unfortunately it was under seasoned. Our two burgers were very underwhelming, and for $25 we expect a little bit more.   The first few bites of my BQM had nice horse radish dressing, but parts where dressing was lacking, flavors and salt were lacking. Same goes for the Shoppe burger, the bites without the goat cheese had no flavors.  I don't think we'll be back. :("}
{"text":"I think this is one of the by far best burgers in Toronto and I do take my burgers very seriously. Big, juicy, fresh and good toppings etc etc.. Order it medium/rare though as the well done ones are on the dry side. Would have given the place a full score if they had a bit more seating and a tad more excitement amongst the staff.. Burger is amazing though and thats why you go there. Also think they should get a bit more sodas etc."}
{"text":"Good music, terrible service, my bacon was BURNT And my party was over cooked... Poutine was too heavy. The guys at the front was not paying attention.... The location is too small with a lack of service and enthusiasm. Needless to say, I won't be returning any time soon... Or ever."}
{"text":"Had the roadhouse burger with a soy patty and fries and almost passed out from happiness. The fries are unique enough that I'm still think about them a day later. If you're looking for an indulgent and delicious lunch in this neighbourhood, this is it."}
{"text":"Honestly, a good burger. They're big and tasty. But the guys at the grill and the counter are rude and short with customers. Every time I've been there I've been made to feel like it's a hassle for them to serve me. It's called the service industry for a reason gentlemen, get with it or find another job away from the people."}
