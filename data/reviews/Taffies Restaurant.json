{"text":"We went to Taffie's expecting what they serve: cheap diner food. 

What we didn't expect was to wait at a table for over an hour for standard breakfast food. 

I'm not picky about breakfast food. I ordered wrong (I ordered a stack when I really prefer to keep everything separate). I knew this was my mistake. The part that wasn't my mistake is that they put this terrible generic canned cheese sauce on top of everything, rendering my meal gross. I said to myself, fine. I ordered wrong. So my husband gave me his pancakes. Which were doughy. (I did not complain). 

The iced tea was good. The service was terrible. Not only did simple orders take forever, the waitress completely ignored the elderly couple next to us so I had to get the poor woman a straw so she could drink her ice water. When I could substitute toast for hashbrowns. The waitress said yes without mentioning an upcharge. Later, we get the bill and toast is on it. She explains that there are no substitutions. I sigh because I'm already leaving hungry and I'm being told I'm getting charged extra for food that was inedible. She then says \"Well, if it's THAT big of deal I can take it off\" 

Better alternative for the same food: Merry Ann's. Upgrade: Le Peep."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so so on a good day. Food here used to be good and cheap and service was also good to excellent. Not sure what happened but can no longer recommend this place. Go to Mary Anne's I guess. All in all bad to mediocre food, prices   Aren't great and service is teetering on the edge of awful."}
{"text":"If you go into Taffies knowing that you won't be getting a gourmet meal from a Michelin star chef, you'll like it.

We go there at least once a month, when we don't feel like cooking, because it's cheap and filling.  Yes, you'll need to season your food.  Yes, the vegetables obviously come from a can.  Yes, the potatoes may or may not be potato flakes.  The wait staff may not be the most \"professional,\" although most of them are very attentive and polite.  But for the portion size, you can't beat the price.  

One time my husband found a hair in his meal.  They replaced the meal and didn't charge us for either the haired one or the replacement one, plus they gave us each a slice of pie on the house.  For under $10, we each enjoyed an entree, potato, vegetable, salad, bread, pie, and soda.  Especially with the economy being as bad as it is, I'm very happy to eat at Taffies knowing that I won't be spending $20 on a meal the size of my palm."}
{"text":"Walking into Taffies was like randomly finding yourself accompanying a friend of a friend to visit their grandparents' double wide.  Dirty, dated, and really, really uncomfortable.

The food was just as bad; very greasy and devoid of any kind of quality.  Nasty, nasty, nasty!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, quick. Pleasant atmosphere .scrumptious food. For being out of town nice quiet."}
{"text":"I will never go back to taffies ever again I set at the counter top for 15 minutes waiting to be served.  When I mention it they never seemed to care I walked out and never go back. Their service and food service sucks I will never go back ever again."}
{"text":"Okay, the other reviews are obviously agist.  Nothing wrong with Senior Citizens.  I was not the youngest person dining this morning nor was I the oldest.  Besides, we'll all be there sooner or later.  My issues are with the dining experience, not the age of customers.  The ambiance is nothing inviting.  I didn't think it dirty, just unimpressive.  The service was prompt, friendly, and courteous.  My coffee cup was kept full.  Sadly, the coffee was terrible.  It tasted bitter and burnt.  I went for a second cup in hope that the first was a fluke.  I had the Mexican Omelet.  It was verging on cold upon arrival and, though large and filled with many things, it lacked any flavor or texture and no amount of salt and pepper could rescue it.  I did like the hash browns, which were a bit warmer than the omelet.  I also ordered a side of grits.  Wow!  It was a huge, heaping bowl with a giant scoop of butter melting on top.  I thought it good and abandoned the omelet in favor of it, though hash browns and grits is not my idea of a breakfast.  I have no interest in returning.  There are too many better breakfast places in the area."}
{"text":"Sadly, THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED. 

The paper says they are looking for a new building but, between rent and maintenance they were losing money at the Mattis location.  Too bad. It was large portions of good, basic food at reasonable prices in a pleasant atmosphere where, should you come alone, usually you could find one or two people you knew well enough to talk with. 

Not fine dining, but good, wholesome, tasty meals. The kind of place you might remember as commonplace a half century ago. Not many left."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife during a weeknight around 8pm. I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelet, side of bacon and pancakes. The omelet was ok, but seemed very greasy. The side of bacon was also greasy and very thin. The pancakes had no flavor even with lots of butter and syrup dumped on them. I'd recommend Perkins or Merry Ann's over this place at least for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Really great place for breakfast.  It's been here a long time. Quality is always good. Cost is always just as good. 

My meal was a ham and cheese omelette, hash browns, english toast, and black coffee. all was very tasty. no complaints."}
{"text":"Ok, all these yuppie kids writing reviews on here, I know you all have dreams of giant suburban new restaurants that serve you $10 pancakes, but Taffie's is an icon of decades before that serves good basic cheap food, which is why there is such an older clientele.  I and many other friends in college found it nice to hang out and go to a diner that was out of the way from campus and served cheap eats when we craved greasy breakfast and a vanilla malt at the same time.  Yea it wasn't anything to write home about, but its greasy diner food, it is exactly what you are looking for when you go to a place like this.  Plus have any of the college kids that reviewed this every eaten at Mary Ann's while sober?  It really isn't that great.

4 Stars for super friendly waitresses/staff, prompt service, cheap eats, letting us sit at a table talking through shift changes and still being super friendly and offering to get us something else, and generally good eats."}
{"text":"Lovely  family place. Great for morning breakfast. The staff is always nice and friendly a md thir fast too. As far as you can be with a busy restaurant. Don't over look.  The place burned a few years ago and was shut down for a while people went nuts because it w as gone.  They have been back for a long while but I see why people went nuts with out them they are awesome."}
{"text":"Really unimpressive. Food was burt, table was gross,  and staff was pretty slow. I hate writing bad reviews, but i really can't recommend coming here when there are so many great unique places in town."}
{"text":"Love eating at Taffies.  Its been in Champaign for years.  Cheap eating with a nice atmosphere. Generous portions, basic, good, food.  If I lived there, I'd probably go more often, but since I am 25 mi away, it happens only a couple times a year."}
{"text":"If you are reading this review, without the help of a grandchild operating the keyboard while you re-arrange the plastic cover on the Davenport, you are too young to eat at Taffies. 

If for some reason you still want what Taffies has, go to Merry Ann's IHOP, or something similar, and you will be much happier."}
{"text":"Old people with no taste buds left must be keeping this place in business..  I have no idea what the appeal of this place is, especially for breakfast.  Go across the street to the pancake house, or down the street a ways to Sammie's."}
