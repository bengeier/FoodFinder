{"text":"My wife and I tried Pickle Jar for the first time for lunch today.  AMAZING!  We had one of each of the three sandwiches and loved them all.  The pulled pork and brisket were our favorites, and it may have been the best brisket we've ever had.  The service was fast and friendly.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwiches- best I've had in Madison. Friendly folks and great food."}
{"text":"I'll drive across town for this cart...  Great barbecue sandwiches, sides so good you just close your eyes and sigh, and Home. Made. Pies.  Huge slices of amazingness. A la mode at your discretion. Good prices, friendly owners, down home feel.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ is more about the quality of the meat, the rub, and the amount of smoke time, than it is about the sauce. To that end, I find that good BBQ is rather hit and miss in the Madison area. That's why I was so surprised to find such excellent BBQ coming out of a food cart about the size of your average pop-up travel trailer.
 It's called the Pickle Jar, a rather unlikely name for an eatery that specializes in BBQ. But, hey, it's a name I'll remember, especially after tasting their delicious smoked meats. And what's this? Homemade pie for dessert? Wow, two of my most favorite things in the world ... BBQ and pie.
 I paid them a visit on a Wednesday afternoon when they were set up at the Capitol View Farmers' Market, off Cottage Grove Road on the city's far East Side. The food cart moves around, so it's always best to check their website (http://www.picklejarbbq.com) to find where they will be on any given day.
 I ordered two sandwiches (pulled pork and beef brisket) and a slice of cherry pie (pie flavors vary daily). The group I was with also ordered a platter of pork ribs to share.
 I'll start with the ribs: Excellent meat, full size pork ribs (not baby-backs) with just the right ratio of fat to lean. Intense smoke flavor, which I really like. A very excellent rub, bringing out the flavor of the meat without overpowering it. Sauce, served on the side, was sweet and tangy. Of all the meats I sampled, the ribs were my favorite. And, unfortunately, the owners tell me they are the slowest sellers because ribs are not particularly conducive to eating on the run, which of course is the type of diners that food carts tend to attract.
 Next up is the pulled pork sandwich. They are a little larger than \"slider\" size, served on a good bakery hamburger bun (not Wonder Bread buns, thank heaven). The meat is moist and tender, and again has that great smoky flavor that I find missing from many so-called BBQ places. Topped with two bread-and-butter pickle slices (made from scratch) and a little of their BBQ sauce, this was a great sandwich.
 The beef brisket sandwich, while certainly not bad, was the least favorite of the three meats I sampled. I thought the beef was a bit dry and crumbly. This is likely my own prejudice showing here. To me, BBQ is all about the pork. I have heard from other people who really like the brisket here, so perhaps I am not the best judge.
 Last, but not least, the pie. In a word, delicious. Tart cherries with just the right amount of sugar and spices. And a hint of orange zest for a very pleasant finish to the palate. The mealy crust was the perfect choice for this type of pie because cherries are so juicy and turn a flaky crust soggy. So kudos for the awesome crust on this pie.
 Their website states that all of their meats are locally sourced, and all of their sauces, pickles, cakes and pies are made in-house, from scratch. The quality shows.
 Food carts have really come a long way from the days of hot dogs and soft pretzels. They are more and more becoming a way for aspiring chefs to showcase their talents without having to sink their life's savings into a brick-and-mortar establishment. The folks at the Pickle Jar are doing it right. They are a welcome addition to the Madison BBQ scene, and I hope they will be around for a long time to come. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome. The owner puts a lot of care into his food and even makes his own pickles. You cannot beat his pies or his cornbread!"}
{"text":"I patiently waited for this cart to come to my local market.  I couldn't wait to try the brisket and the pie and the pulled pork and the pickles.  I was going to try it all!

So tonight I ordered the sandwich and pie combo.  $8, not tragic.  The sandwich was SO small.  It was the size of a dinner roll.  I don't eat very much, but I could finish that sandwich in three bites.  There are tons of place that do BBQ well in Madison, so you must up your game.  

The other half of my combo was a piece of pecan pie.  It was really sweet and just unimpressive.  Honestly, this whole meal was just a collective sad sigh.  Save your money and slide on over to another cart.

6/2 Update.  The business responded to me, but unfortunately you can only see their note below.  I was rather taken back by the fact that they said I \"insulted\" them because of their hard work.  I believe everyone in the food cart community works hard but there is also a great deal of competition.  I have tried BBQ all around town and I can honestly say that the Pickle Jar was underwhelming.  Rather than say I was \"insulting\" their hard work, they could take the criticism for what it is worth.  Their product, in my opinion is not as good as others out there.  Nothing stood out to me.  And rather than say it was \"insulting\" their hard work, they could realize I said nothing about the work.  Great work on making a food cart.  It still does not mean I thought your food was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ! The brisket is the best I've had in Madison and their pickles are delicious. However, the buns are nothing special and take the taste down a notch due to being hard and not tasting as fresh as the other ingredients. I also ordered the sloppy joe which had chorizo and beef. Everything tasted good except the buns."}
{"text":"i love brisket myself, and I happened to work nearby. The barbecue sauce was great. So maybe because I was expecting that to be stunning, I was a little bit disappointed that it came out a bit on the dry side. The bun was soggy. It's more expensive side for a portion that didn't fill my usual lunch stomach (It has other competing food trucks nearby too), so I didn't happen to return for a second visit."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork sandwich today, with a side of pickled cole slaw and cornbread. 

The pulled pork sandwich was excellent. The meat was tender, perfectly seasoned with a wonderfully sweet and tangy barbecue sauce, and topped with a couple homemade pickle slices. The only suggestion I could make here would be to maybe switch up the bun. I only took mine about twenty steps away to eat it, and by the time I got there most of the bun was soggy already. I would prefer a bun that held up to the ingredients in it.

The pickled cole slaw was a neat idea, but I wasn't really a fan. The flavor was more like sauerkraut, with slightly bitter notes and a heavy flavor of onion, as that was mixed in too. Some baked beans or a really solid traditional cole slaw would knock it out of the park.

The cornbread was excellent as well, a fluffy huge piece with slightly browned and crisped edges, with a sweet but not cloying flavor.

Overall, well done! I'll definitely be back and would recommend this cart if you're looking for BBQ in the downtown/campus area."}
{"text":"Wow.... Pickle Jar BBQ is the real deal.

Authentic Texas BBQ right here in Madison, who knew?  I tried the pulled pork which was excellent.  Perfect texture and moisture level.  The bun didn't get soggy between the time I got my food and scored an outdoor table at Union South next door.  Blueberry pie was also tops.  Next time I need to try the beef brisket.  Word is they sell out of that fast so get there early.

Both the sandwich and pie came in clam shell containers, I got plasticware, a napkin and my very own Pickle Bar BBQ sticker making the whole experience easy to grab-and-go.  Great operation, guys, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Pickle Jar about four times in the last 6 months -- partially based on convenience but also because they have a nice, sassy southern BBQ sauce that I like (as a departure from my usual preference for sweet BBQ).

I've had their brisket twice and their chicken twice and on my most recent trip I decided to try to beans... these are the items I'll review but they also have a few more menu options in case you want to check on those, too.

Brisket: The first time I had the brisket it was somewhat dry. I chalked this up to a bad day and the second time I obtained it I was proven correct. That being said... I wasn't crazy about it. It was alright but it just didn't scratch that brisket itch. I didn't feel like the pickle worked with the brisket very well, either. All in all it's a 2.5 - 3 star brisket and that's not too bad for a food cart.

Chicken: This is where itches for BBQ get scratched. Both times I had the chicken and it has been tender and delicious. The sauce really shines with it, too. Couple this with the Pickle Jar's signature pickles which did heighten the flavor of an already good sandwich... yeah. It's definitely a 4 star chicken sandwich which -- for something as pedestrian as that -- well, yeah. There's a reason that's probably what I'll be getting any time I visit them.

Beans: Oof. I did not care for these at all. Mine were a little soupy and some of the beans still a little hard. This was the reason I didn't go a full on four for these folks despite their great BBQ chicken. If it was like the brisket and they had an off day -- the day was really off. Off to the extent that I'd rather not try these again to find out...

All told -- they're a reasonably priced food cart, their sauce reminded me a little of trips to Austin, and while they stumble on a couple of things they definitely have their chicken nailed."}
