{"text":"The best pizza in town in my opinion.  If you like a good medium crust pizza with just a bit of chew to the crust then this is for you.  The toppings are also fresh.  They have a full menu of Italian fare and it's all good.  Very friendly staff and perfect ambiance for what it is."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here.  It is definitely tucked away, in the corner of Touchstone Shopping Center.  The outside is very nondescript and the interior is small but nice.  It took a while to get served drinks, but we walked in behind two larger parties. From there service was fast and friendly.  
Had salmon in a pesto cream sauce served over pasta. Yum, two large pieces of fish in a delicious sauce...took half home.  Barbecue chicken pizza was yummy...nice crust, tangy sauce...took half home.  Manicotti & Lasagna, hot, baked, and tasty...took more than half home. Obviously serving sizes are very generous.
My favorite was the garlic knots.  Yeasty, warm and delicious.
This is worth a repeat!"}
{"text":"Riccios is now open for Lunch with a special Lunch menu Monday-Friday 11am-2pm! Come stop by and check us out!"}
{"text":"Long time Charlotte restaurant. Some of best Italian around, and reasonably priced. Penne ala Vodka is favorite."}
{"text":"I had the Tortolloni Bellagio without mushrooms, and it was RIDICULOUSLY GOOD.  Oh my gosh is was some of the best pasta I'd ever had.  It did taste kind of like really good macaroni and cheese but it was of the gods it was so cheesy and delicious.  My friend had spaghetti with marinara sauce.  The marinara sauce tasted kinda strange, so it was just ok.  The garlic knots they serve you for appetizers are delicious as well.  This place is definitely off the  beaten path and most people wouldn't know about it.  Thankfully, it came recommended by a native Charlotte person as I moved here recently."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Charlotte? Debatable. But it's pretty darn good. They are definitely in my rotation of go-to pizza spots. The portions and ingredients are good. I will agree they have excellent service. The interior isn't anything special but it's not an eyesore either. Stop by if you're in the neighborhood and you shan't be disappointed.

Edit: They do not serve pizza by the slice. I definitely thought it was important to note that."}
{"text":"I just had the chicken parm and it was terrible.  The meat was lumpy and undercooked or something.  I had to actually spit out 3 bites until I gave up on it.  The tomato sauce was overly tangy in a weird way.  Last time I went it was pretty good.  Definitely wont return."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! We meet friends there regularly, and treat ourselves during the week. DO NOT MISS THE LASAGNA! It is rich and hot! Large house salad with chicken is very generous!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place...but they got part of our order wrong and forgot to bring my husbands wine. Way over priced for the atmosphere. They got  busy while we were there so some old lady cashed us out..never spoke a word or smiled at us. Just took our card, ran it, set it on the table, scowled at us and walked away. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good italian restaurant. Food deserving of 5 stars but service wasn't the best. Saw a photo on Yelp and asked to order, server wasn't sure. Owner came over and instead of being polite with suggestions, bluntly acknowledge the food pic but made no suggestions as to what it was, other than it was pasta someone picked there own toppings. Pizza was awesome but service was bleh. Owner asked everyone about their food but never came by my table to ask about my choice. Cute place but shitty owner!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough of how much we enjoyed our experience.  First time for my wife and I.  We had heard many good things about Riccio's and finally had a chance to try it.

We arrived at 6:30 to find an almost full restaurant, with a very nice ambiance.  My wife ordered the eggplant parm, which at first appeared to be pricey.  But the amount of food was plenty and very tasteful.  I ordered the penne chicken and sausage, which came with a generous amount of chicken and sausage.  The complimentary garlic bread was very good.

Portions are big, especially when you consider the complimentary garlic bread."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte from NY 3 months ago. I grew up on a block with 3 families who owned Italian restaurants. So I've been spoiled with good Italian food! This place is definitely compatible! 

We walked in and who I believe was the owner greeted us. He told us to make ourselves comfortable at the bar while we waited for friends. My husband wished they had draft beer but they had beer so he was good. I do wish they had more craft beers but as long as they were supporting the locals I was happy. The house Pinot Grigio was great. 

The dining room is small and tight. We sat close by another couple at first but when we asked to move they were more than accommodating! I'm a loud speaker so I didn't want to interrupt others. 

The complimentary garlic knots were good. They would have been SO MUCH better if they were served with a side of olive oil! Our server was amazing. He explained the menu and offered suggestions to my very picky friend. I've been craving eggplant so I went with the eggplant parm. My husband got the chicken parm. Our friends got the baked ziti and the linguine carbonara. 

My eggplant was excellent! It was thick sliced but not too thick. I'm picky with eggplant because some places don't take the water out of it before cooking and it gets watery. This was juicy but far from watery. It was perfect and the sauce was great. I mean... It wasn't MY sauce but it was pretty damn good. My husband wolfed down his chicken parm before I could even get a taste so I guess it was good! My friends liked their food and it looked great. The only thing that was a little ah was the carbonara didn't have pancetta it was bacon. 

Overall, can't wait to go back and bring my mom when she comes to visit! We'll be back next Friday for pizza! So happy to find a place that felt like home :)"}
{"text":"Love the ravioli and the lasagna. Everything is a 10 out of 10 I really recommend it for Italian lovers"}
{"text":"ALWAYS a treat. FRiendly service, best original pizzas in town. Tanya is a whiz at remembering your favorite drink, salad dressing and usually your entree'. Ricki always comes by to make sure your food is as you like it. VERY PERSONAL SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Still a huge fan 2 years later - they have recently updated the interior - has a really warm and fuzzy feeling now - Tanya is the best!  Great wine prices and the food is still 4-star - love this place!"}
{"text":"I visited Riccio's for the first time after a coworker recommended it. She raved about the pizza so we tried it. I must say it wasn't my favorite pizza ever. It was a veryyyyy thin crust pizza with a sweet sauce.  As we waited for our takeout the owner or manager came by and greeted us. He was very friendly and thanked us for coming in. I think next time I will try something other than pizza."}
{"text":"We have been a fan of Riccio's for almost 15 years.  We always have great service and have never had a bad meal.  They have incredible Garlic knots that our kids can't stop eating and I honestly don't blame them!  Pasta dishes are awesome and their pizza is probably the best in South Charlotte and top 3 in the Charlotte region in my opinion.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had not been to Riccio's in many years my wife had never been and wanted to try it.Server was very attentive and friendly. Food was ok but not the best Italian I've ever had. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.My wife and I are both Italian and have eaten Italian food all over Charlotte and in Italy. The big surprise was the cost. For 3 people, one having the nightly special, one having pasta and the other having chicken, one appetizer and no alcohol was over $70! You don't even get a side salad with the dinner at that price! Very disappointed and won't be going back....."}
{"text":"Garlic knots, is all that needs to be said.  Half a dozen for 2 bucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian Restorante' 

We shall return someday.........."}
{"text":"Hell, I'll go ahead and give Riccio's five stars, even though we had to wait awhile for our food! Read on to find out why.

Visited Riccio's this past Friday night. Arrived at 6:45 and were seated by 7. Ordered 2 pasta dishes, lasagne and manicotti, as well as some garlic knots. Prices seemed very good. Restaurant ambiance was nice. Wait staff was quite friendly.

The only issue was that our food took roughly 45 minutes to come out.

In that time though, our waitress took care of us. She dropped another 6 garlic knots off at our table, when she saw things were going long. We ordered another round of beers just before our food came. We'd been hoping to just have one beer with dinner but when you're waiting for 45 minutes, you get thirsty.

Our food finally did come, and I went from peeved to purely thrilled. The tomato sauce is different from anything I've ever tasted and the cheese on the top of the manicotti was crisped in such a way that it was nearly a light crust. I ate every single bite, even though I had eaten far too many garlic knots before it arrived. My meal was unreal. Was it \"Italian Authentic\"? I don't know. I've been to Italy three times and have never had manicotti that tasted this delicious so maybe it's not \"authentic\" but it's what I loved. That's all that mattered.

When we got our check I was kind of surprised at the cost. Surprised in that it was less than I had expected. Not only had our waitress comped our second round of garlic knots, she also comped our second round of beers because she had to wait longer than usual.

It's unusual you find a \"long standing tradition\" kind of place that's \"family run\" but is also this friendly and this generous. Riccio's is all of that, and to top it off the food is phenomenal - easily the best in Charlotte. The waitress explained that our long wait was an aberration due to a whole flurry of pizzas that took up the oven right before we ordered. I don't think it's a common problem, and I can't complain after all they did for us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. A must stop place. We're new in town and found the restaurant on yelp. Food was great and the service was awesome. This will definitely be a place we come to often for Italian food. A+"}
{"text":"Riccio's now has a great new loyalty program called BELLY!  Sign up and start earning rewards for great food and appetizers. Belly up ! We have been enjoying Riccio's since 1994. It is absolutely the best quality Italian food in town."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant with a friend and I had the spaghetti.  It was delicious.  The waitress was great too.  The prices weren't high either.  All I have to say about this restaurant is positive.  I will be going back for sure and you would be wise to check it out for yourself.  We went around 5:30 p.m. and it was very quiet.

S. Cooper"}
{"text":"Wouldn't honor 20% off... I followed the Click Here for 20% off, filled out my information and it \"checked in\". It gave me 4 hours to show the coupon to someone from Riccio's. Nothing indicates it doesn't apply to delivery. I called to clarify and was told the owner said that doesn't apply. Obviously this is a common question. The woman then told me this is a yelp coupon,  not Riccio's and she wouldn't honor the coupon unless I came to the restaurant. They have a similar deal on their site and all she had to do was offer that one. Instead she had an attitude. Won't go there again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.   Good service.  Good food.  And I especially like the crayons and paper table cover to write on. Hangman or tic-tac-toe are good fun while the food is prepared.  Kazoo bbq pizza is awesome"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered pizza and garlic knots togo last night and were completely underwhelmmed with the quality of both. Nothing about either item seemed fresh or homemade. The garlic knots were very close to being burnt on top, but were raw in the middle.. which likely means they were FROZEN and placed in the oven to bake.. We attempted to finish cooking them ourselves, but in the end we just threw them away. The pizza crust was flavorless and seemed generic.. reminded me of school pizza but with better toppings. The prices for this place match local pizzerias such as mellow mushroom, fuel and tony's in Ballantyne - however the quality and flavor does NOT.  I felt like I completely wasted my money."}
{"text":"This was one of my fav Italian restaurant in charlotte but lately the quality of food has gone down. I got the penne puttanesca (spicy pasta) but all I had was felt like a store bought pasta + some store bought pasta sauce with some veggies and crushed red peppers for $15. I could have make it better at home. Kids butter pasta was really good in the past but this time the pasta we got was all salt.... made $40 bill but got food which was well below par. One thing is sure, I won't be returning to the restaurant."}
{"text":"First trip tonight and we really liked Riccio's. 

Small and friendly interior. Service was the best I've had at a restaurant in a long time. Every server was so friendly and attentive. The owner/manager (?) was present and walking around chatting with guests (an important touch you often don't see anymore). The food came out very quickly and was delicious. 

The only low point was the ceasar salad. The lettuce was not terribly crisp, the dressing not very tangy and the croutons were clearly bagged. However, this was the only miss of the night and was far out weighed by the positives."}
{"text":"The best Italian delivery! Large portions and always good. Super fast delivery and staff excellent at handling orders. Salads are fresh. Which is hard to find in a restaurant that delivers."}
{"text":"Love their eggplant parm!
Its definitely on the pricer side but the food is on point! 
Nothing fancy, just plain good food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My boys love the pasta and meatballs. Their pizzas are also their favorite as well. For me the menu is endless. The sausage and peppers is especially tasty. The staff is always very friendly, professional and extremely attentive. I have been coming here since 2010and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The service was average.  The waitress made us feel very rushed. The staff dresses inappropriate for a restaurant setting.  The food was marginal. The chicken in my pasta was very dry. I did not eat it. My husbands lasagna was very mushy.  My Caesar salad was not cold and the dressing was watery.   The rolls were tough and no butter came with it . We won't be back.  Very disappointed and went here due to the rating.   There are better Italian restaurants in town. Go to one of those instead."}
{"text":"Thanks to LivingSocial I discovered this awesome restaurant. The food and service was excellent and I'll definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but not what I'd call outstanding, and seemed a bit pricier than comparable places.  No complaints about service or decor ( tho the waitress did seem a bit stressed keeping up at the beginning of the dinner time)."}
{"text":"Great family spot hidden away in a small shopping area. We are luck to have this little mom & pop shop for a delicious Italian meal whenever we want to take our 2yr old daughter out. She loves the garlic knots. They surprise you how great the are!"}
{"text":"We found this hidden gem when we came over a year ago while looking for houses in the area. We love the food! We were sad when they stopped opening for lunch. The lasagna and sausage and pepper sandwich are our favorites! The only bad thing is that they don't have the vodka sauce anymore, that was our favorite by far. :( If anyone from Riccio's reads this, can I have that recipe please?! :) Or can you put it back on the menu?! :)"}
{"text":"Listen I get that their Italian food is great.  Their pizza is ok and near me.  But am I the only one who thinks that their customer service when you order delivery is horrendous? When I order pizza from them I feel like I'm treated as an 'inconvinience' and not as a customer who is giving them my money.  No other restaurant has convinced me to download Yelp and leave a review, and every time I order pizza from them I regret it because of the way I'm talked to."}
{"text":"We bought a few catering dishes. Chicken parm was pretty good. Baked ziti was bland and kinda dry. Rolls and salad were basic. From a value perspective, it was certainly overpriced for the quality and quantity. They were able to accommodate a same day order for the catering trays. The location is off the beaten path. One and done."}
{"text":"The food here is simply excellent.  All fresh and handcrafted (they don't own a microwave:-).  And the value (price+portion size+quality) is exceptional.  Family run and they take great pride in their work."}
{"text":"I must admit for a small place. And also in the middle of nowhere. They have the BEST veal in all of the Carolinas. Nice milk white veal and always perfectly pounded and cooked. Also make great pasta and olive oil and garlic."}
{"text":"Great food, decent price, easily the best hidden gem of S. Charlotte.  The Tortellini Alfredo haunts my dreams, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food from a family restaurant! The food here is excellent and homemade Italian. I loved the heavenly garlic knots!  The bread is soft and delicious! They have an extensive menu of Italian specials. I liked the shrimp and pasta entree, great garlic seasoning. The catering is excellent also for special events. We had baked ziti, salads, garlic knots for a school luncheon and it was generous portions portions and great service. They set up the food with sternos and brought fantastic food!"}
{"text":"We have found our go-to pizza delivery that we've been searching for since we moved here!  It was off our radar since it's farther from our place, but our neighbors ordered and said they'll still deliver to us even though we're slightly outside their delivery radius.  

Some of the best pizza I've had in ages.  We ordered my guilty pleasure (usually we try to go with veggies to keep it *somewhat* healthy....) Large pepperoni + black olives w/ a side salad with Ranch.  How good your ranch dressing is sort of a benchmark in my book.  Fresh restaurant made ranch tells me a lot about the restaurant.  Outstanding ranch!  Definitely not from a bottle...

Pizza was fantastic.  Great dough, great sauce, great ratio of sauce, cheese and toppings...  All around fabulous pizza!  I've been searching for Riccios for a LONG time!  Yay for having found our go-to pizza delivery!  Looking forward to trying the Italian delicacies on the menu.  I am sure it's all great..."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!! WOW
They close at 10p on Saturday but welcomed us at 910 with open arms!
The garlic knots were the best I've ever had! (Fuel Pizza has no idea!)
Mozzarella SO filling, 2 big triangles.
Tortelloni Bellagio great, cheese filled tortellini w/a fantastic cream sauce. Ordered w/o mushrooms.
Baked Ziti was good.
Meatballs side dish so good! Bit of nutmeg taste.
So much food had to take the Italian Lemon Cream Cake home!!
Will come back ...and ask for Macon to be your server she was phenomenal !!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, pasta, lasagna, garlic knots. My wife and I order pizza from here often. The staff is always friendly and service is very attentive."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Very traditional Italian, loved it. I had the Lasagna it was very good, my husband had the sausage and peppers with spaghetti, wow they had so many sausages in it, and it was awsome. This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"Riccio's has been a tradition for my husband and I for as long as we have been together (almost 10 years). When Touchstone Village used to have a Food Lion in it, and a video store, he lived in the neighborhood behind it, and would walk from his house. Cue his current best friend that moved in 2 doors down when he was 7 and they would ride their bikes up there every weekend. 

Needless to say, our group of 4 is recognized when we come in. I know the original two waitresses have literally watched my husband and his friend grow up, and consistently order the same thing (garlic knots, house salads, and pizza). 

Even now we still order the same garlic knots, salad, and pizza, albeit our group is a bit larger. The food has never disappointed. The salads are always \"the best house salads\" ever, and the pizza is always fresh from the oven in less than 15 minutes even with a packed house. 

Although with recent renovations, the place has grown, and had a face lift this is still the family restaurant we have known and loved for years. You are always greeted with a smile, the owner will always be there and converse with every table, and you will always leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if not for the calamari. it was slightly undercooked. When you pull up to this place, it seems like a hole in the wall Cafe in a strange tucked away location.  But the interior is clean, simple yet updated. the baked ziti and lasagna were the best we have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Yhe whole family went there last night. Westarted out with the fried calamari. It was cooked just right. No rubbery at all. And the dipping sauce was excellent.

We had the shrimp with marinara, again cooked perfectly as well as the seafood in a spicy marinara. The puzza was delicious and the kids spaghetti seemed to be a hit with the kiddos.

Our server had alot of pwople seated at the same time but she did a great job. Overall a great place to take thw family for a night of italian."}
{"text":"Immediately was thrown off by who worked there and who did not. All staff were wearing casual clothing. My waitress seemed on edge and when she came to my table and I told her I was ready to order she told me to wait because she had to go to another table. We ordered chicken Parmesan but the marinara sauce was way too sweet. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have known for quite a while that Riccios was tucked away in the Touchstone shopping center  (along with Tuesday Morning and the Touchstone Yellow Rose) but haven't bothered going before now because I thought it was just another super casual pizza joint. 

So, when we saw the recent Groupon deal, we decided to go and check it out.  Needless to say, we were suprised when we walked in the door last Friday night and found the place jam-packed with people.  It was standing room only! However, Ricky found a spot for us to have a seat on some barstools back by the kitchen while we waited .  We waited no more than 5 -10 minutes and then were taken to our table.

We decided to start with an order of calamari and garlic knots.  The calamari was breaded and cooked just right - not rubbery or chewy. The marinara sauce was fresh and tasty.  The garlic knots were seasoned to perfection and quite tasty.  Our server was very helpful in answering our questions about various menu items. It was a tough decision though because they had a nice selection of pastas, pizzas, and entree favs like chicken parm, chicken marsala, eggplant parm, etc.

I was really torn between the vegetable lasagna and the Tortolloni Bellagio.  I ended up with the tortelloni which was served in a cream sauce with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, and chicken (around $15).  It was very good, but rather rich, so next time I think I'll check out the veggie lasagna or one of the pizzas.  (I saw several other tables with pizzas that looked really good.) 

Other people in my party ordered veal marsala (around $18), chicken parm (around $16), and chicken francaise (around $16).  I thought the chicken parm & chicken francaise (similar to chicken piccata) both looked good. Since I don't eat veal, I thought that dish looked icky. ;-)  

One of our friends had a birthday so we ordered a dessert to share and of course, had to go with the tiramisu. It was good - perfect texture and flavor. 

Overall, I was pleasantly suprised about our entire experience here. The food was good, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was friendly & comfy.  We ended up spending a little more than expected we would (the bill came to around $100 before tip for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert, and 3 beers) but the place was still reasonably priced.  We are definitely looking forward to our next visit.

Ricky came by to chat with us and we found out this is the same Riccios that was originally in Myers Park (started by Ricky's family) and then was over at Strawberry Hill for a while.  Long time Charlotteans may remember Riccios from one of the previous locations.  In any case, we hope they stay in this location for a long, long time!  

Oh, and as a bonus, we found out they deliver to our neighborhood, so SCORE for those nights when we're too lazy to cook or go out!"}
{"text":"Riccio's is a family restaurant.  It has a great neighborhood feel, the owner has been there on every visit. The food doesn't wow me, but it is a great place to grab something to eat moderately priced.

We had pizza, two good things to mention, it is thin crust and they aren't heavy on the toppings.  It is a very balanced pizza.   I ordered a glass of wine, it was just bad all together, the glass had an odor, the wine tasted horrible, so I asked the waitress to get me another glass of something different.  The second one wasn't any better.   I think I will stick to ordering by the bottle or drinking beer.  Other than that, we had a fun evening.  Service is always tops."}
{"text":"The expanded location is very nice. The food is just as great as it ever was.  I am a huge fan of pizza and Riccio's version should not be missed. Although pleasant, the service was painfully slow, but that's what you get going out on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and I just wasn't impressed. I'm an Italian food snob and will go out of my way for good italian food. This isn't it. It missed the mark on everything we ordered. Def not worth another visit"}
{"text":"Riccio's is my favorate spot in South Charlotte.  Great Italian cooking served in a friendly casual environment with plenty of parking.  And, it's priced right, too."}
{"text":"So happy to have Riccio's in the Touchstone neighborhood. You know the movies or TV shows with the local pizza joint that families always go to after soccer games or church? Enter Riccio's. 

It may be a little hard to locate in the corner of the shopping center off of Baybrook, but once you find it, it's easy to tell it's a gem. 

A quaint interior with tables and booths and plenty of smiling faces. My wife and I stumbled in to pick up a pizza and garlic knots. The service was so fast! Ready in less than 15 minutes!

Let me take this opportunity to blow your mind. Eggplant Parmesan pizza. Yes. Commence drooling. Fried eggplant, marinara and gratuitous amounts of mozz on a pizza. Holy cow. Amazing. Chewy eggplant with a light layer of seasoned breading. The garlic knots were the best I've had to date. Not coated in grease like so many other places. Dusted with garlic powder and finishes with a welcoming chew. The dough is wonderful. Great for sopping up extra marinara!

So happy to have finally visited Riccio's! Can't wait to head back to our new little neighborhood pizza place!"}
{"text":"I've been doing carry out here for about a year. Mainly pizza, delish and an occasional spaghetti. Decided to ditch the sweats and put on my big girl pants and eat in last night. Seriously, the food here is awesome. The service was just okay, even though the place was not packed. Our waiter was nice, but a bit absent. Honestly, once our food arrived, it didn't really matter. I ordered the Pasta Pomodoro and truly the BEST pasta I've ever had in a restaurant. I grew up in Chicago and in an Italian family and community and it's saying a lot. I'm very particular about my pasta and this was amazing. My husband had the Baked Ziti and our son went for the Chicken Parmesan. Their entrees were also good and large enough portions to take home leftovers for all. If you're looking for that truly authentic, tucked away, family Italian Restaurant, look no further. If you're a chain restaurant, Olive Garden type of person, you won't find that stuff here. Would give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Riccio's is a great example of a family owned Italian restaurant. The food is consistently excellent and authentic. The staff (especially Tonya) is friendly, efficient and well trained. The hands on owner Ricky, is always around either cooking in the kitchen or checking on his customers in the front of the house. We have tried most dishes on the menu from their excellent veal to the savory seafood. Riccio's is one of our favorite go to local spots and we will continue to patronize this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"If you want Italian, this is an amazing place to go. The lasagna was delicious. It was a stuffed lasagna, which isn't my favorite, as I like a lot more noodles, but it more than made up for it by being incredible."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for early Friday dinner. We had the bruschetta appetizer and chicken parmesan and shrimp diavolo for our entrees.
The service was excellent (thank you Tanya) and food was a solid four stars. I would recommend this place if you are in the area and like Italian food."}
{"text":"Rolls were doughy and undercooked even second batch  which started off evening not so great since was a Xmas thank you dinner to neighbors for their help. Requested chicken in boyfriend's Baked Ziti. Somewhat small portion and chicken not tender. My Fettuccine was good, but not much of extra sauce asked for. All in all was just ok."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  Service was great and my water was kept full.  I ordered the special of the day: portabella mushroom ravioli with choice of sauce.  I decided to be demanding and asked for 1/2 alfredo 1/2 marinara.  They put the sauces in bowls and allowed me to sauce it myself.
My friends mostly got the special as well, except one person got a greek pizza.  It looked really good.  I enjoyed the ravioli, but my friends weren't too keen on it.

they have a bar opening soon from what they were saying so Riccio's is expanding."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars because the service was friendly and accommodating. Pizza...2 stars, presentation...1 star. Why do all the places around here say NY style pizza? Not even close :("}
{"text":"The chopped salad was the best I've ever had! The chicken parmesan had little to no cheese so I sent it back. Ordered white wine and when it arrived there was red wine all over the glass. I couldn't tell if the glass was dirty or clean but since it was covered in red wine, I sent it back. Our waitress was very apologetic. The manager brought the new wine to me but didn't offer any apologies. He just said \"is this for you\" smiled, sat it down and walked away. Our waitress was Angela, she was awesome!!!!!!!!! Oh and the summer sangria was also great!."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Parmesan and the Tortelloni Bellagio. The sauce over the Bellagio is super flavorful and their house marinara is legit. So glad we found this place in our backyard. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent local joint tucked away. Chicken parm is huge and delicious. Pizzas are fantastic. Kids loved it too. Great service."}
{"text":"I love great food and great service...so I was excited to come here...busy, good energy....all the right stuff. 

But I didn't order pasta soup? 
I order pasta arrabiatta...full fresh veggies and thick sauce and it came out like soup, no flavor other \"heat\". They took 20 minutes to come back to the table and there sat my food. 

The waitress was really busy and sweet.,the food I sent back AND was charged for.

Not a second from me."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Had a very pleasant evening with fast service! I couldn't tell if the waitress was frustrated we were there or if she was just not having a good night. We almost felt like we were a nuisance either way :-/ She still got our order in and out quickly and our drinks were always full so that's why I am giving a 5 star. But the pleasant persona wasn't there :( I really love this place and I'm so glad they've stuck around with all the changes that have happened in this little shopping center!"}
{"text":"Super cute place, hidden in plain sight. The food & service were excellent.  Riccio's is perfect for families or date night. I had the Chicken Parmesan & it was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this little place...

A friend and I had dinner here on 2/2/14. He had been before, I had not. Apparently they expanded the restaurant which I think was a smart move. I noticed they had a small bar as well...not sure if this was because they now had the space but good for them! As soon as we walked in we were acknowledged, greeted and seated quickly. Immediately thereafter our drink order was taken and things only got better! 

The friendly server, Gabriella was pleasantly eager to take our order. We ordered salads, lasagna and garlic rolls. I ordered veggie lasagna. The salads were delicious. Just the right size. The lasagna was also very good. I'd never tried vegetable lasagna so I can't really compare, but the noodles were right, the sauce was right and yummy yum. Again, a great portion for the price. The atmosphere was very family oriented and everyone seemed very pleased.

Orders were flying out of the kitchen, the staff were managing it very well and seemed to work well together. The owner, Mr. Riccio working right along with everyone, came across like a nice guy and someone who valued every customer that graced his entrance. A great place for a cozy Italian dinner. Great job Mr. Riccio, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is average at best. Dough is chewy and sauce tastes from a can. Garlic knots were okay but could be better. I really can't seem to find a good pie in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The wonderful waitress I mentioned earlier in Tonya.  Wife and I had dinner last night at Ricco's and sat at the same table as before and there was Tonya.  She is truly super, accommodating and eager for everyone to have a great meal and experience.

First an order of four garlic rolls, which could be a meal alone.  Soft, chewy, flavorful and delicious.  Make sure you give them a shot.

Their pizza, our first ordered there, was great.  It was an artichoke, tomato, onion and garlic combo, a suggestion on their menu, and it was thin crust.  What flavor and the dough was wonderfully yeasty and pleasantly chewy.  No wonder there are so many pizzas to-go.

I had an egg-battered lemony snapper with a side of linguine.  To me, not so good, as it was too buttery.  Thought the sauce could have done with more white wine.  I was not paying attention when Tonya asked, \"marinara?\"   I said OK and when the nice sized pasta portion arrived it was mounded with their rich marinara.  Problem was that I really don't care for marinara so just picked at it.

Come time to clear the table, Tonya asked about the pasta. 

I came clean and mentioned as I did above and she replied that I should have sent the pasta back so that they could top the linguini with the lemon/white wine/butter sauce.  And that she would have had them put more wine in the sauce.

A great example as to how a good wait person can adjust your meal to your satisfaction.

My wife thinks that I was being too friendly with the waitress.  Maybe..."}
{"text":"In town for soccer tournament - great find and highly recommend !! Great food and service! Left my eye glasses there and they are so kind to mail them back!!  Will be back next time in the area."}
{"text":"Great service!! My boyfriend and I went to Riccio's for takeout. Since it was our first visit we asked for recommendations from the Riccio's staff. We ended up sharing a caesar salad (really big, definitely share-able), he ordered Tortolloni Bellagio and I got the daily special, Portabello Ravioli. It was SO good. Very creamy and rich. Excellent comfort food. The Bellagio was the standout. We were licking the takeout container after we finished. Sad that I lived in the area for more than 2 years before finding this authentic Italian ristorante. I HIGHLY recommend. Good for date night, dinner with the parents and takeout."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but sadly was very disappointed. The calamari was super dry and flavorless. The garlic knots are OK, but again dry and very little flavor. I actually do prefer mine with somewhat of a light butter on them (not soaking in butter or oil, just a little). Penne Elizabeth didn't have much flavor and I can't even remember the name of the 2nd dish we ordered which tells you how great it was. I did like the ceasar dressing. Would like to give this place another try just because of all the great reviews. Food did take awhile to receive and the place was packed on a Sunday evening so heads up during football season."}
{"text":"This is a sit down family restaurant focused on old school Italian food and recipes. It wasn't bad but it lacked flare. The server, I felt was so in a rush to take the order and leave. She really didn't spend the time to educate new patrons on their specials or specialities. If you want a platter of old Italian recipes, this is the place."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent.  Awesome Eggplant pizza, spaghetti - meat sauce and meat balls.  Salads are great, and so is the chicken parm.  Not my favorite pizza, however, if you want eggplant pizza - awesome.
Delivery is within an hour, sometimes within 30 min's."}
{"text":"This popular little Italian joint is a rarity, a family owned and operated restaurant in south Charlotte. It has anchored its hard-to-find shopping center, Touchstone Village, for at least the past 25 years after being started as a family business in 1962.

After a mediocre dinner nine months ago, my wife and I opted to give it another shot for a Friday night dinner. Its reputation alone and do-it-all, ever-present owner Ricky warranted such, and in all fairness, was overdue. Dinner is your only choice for dining here now as they no longer serve lunch. Chicken, fish and seafood entrees run $18-22. A conspicuously older clientele, many of whom were regulars, didn't seem to mind however as the place was again packed. As usual, Ricky tirelessly and cheerfully doted on diners between seating guests.

We ordered one of their specialties, the Chicken Parm at $21 and it was moist, delicious and plentiful. In fact it was  even better than our last visit, however the Chicken & Veggies with Penne was very dry due to the fact that the chicken was diced into small cubes which tend to dry out during cooking. We replaced it with the Vodka Pasta at $14 and it was okay but nothing special. We both got side salads at $5.50 each which are accompanied by garlic knots. Both were pretty good.

Our main gripe last visit was the horrible service provided by our server. This visit it was greatly improved in spite of the fact that we had the same server.

Overall, I feel it definitely earned an upgrade from 3 stars to 4. I will be back again but will stick to the chicken or veal parm or pizza."}
{"text":"Mine and my best friends favorite date night spot. We absolutely love it. I always get the ziti and they have a great wine choice but get there early, they fill up quick. Tonya is our favorite sever !"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was on point. We had wings pizza and beer. Another member of our party had the baked ziti. Everything was tasty and served to us quickly."}
{"text":"Not sure how me missed this place for so many years, but we are thankful we finally found a great Italian restaurant in the South Charlotte area. Great family atmosphere and great food! We have never gotten this much attention from a server...she was practically sitting at our table with us!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the authentic Italian. Particularly like the veal piccata over linguine and the pizza. My husband is a fan of the veal Parmesan."}
{"text":"Hidden gem: smashed between two gyms and a massive structure under construction, I never would have though the best pizza in Charlotte would be here. I have lived in Charlotte for 5 months and am from the Northeast. I have tried all kinds of pizza places and they have all failed. This Charlottean obsession with trying to make \"New York style\" pizza has to stop. No- your pizza does not taste good and it is certainly not New York style. I have searched high and low to find normal pizza in Charlotte, but it cannot be found. It's as though restaurants have forgotten how to make normal, regular pizza. It is so sad because Charlotte fails with food in so many other areas...

Anyway, back to Riccio's. Pizza was great. Ok, it was still thin crust, semi wanna be NY pizza, but maybe not. It was authentically homemade. The cheese- great. The crust- delicious. The toppings- quality. Not too greasy at all, but not dry and plain. We had mushroom and pepperoni- sticking to ordinary things. Flavor was great. 
Pasta was delicious also.

If I were staying in Charlotte, I would have found my pizza joint. Riccio's, you impress me. Thank you."}
{"text":"Here we have one of my Favorite, probably most favorite places to get Pizza!  The dinning room is comfortable and the service is relaxed and friendly.  The Salad Dressing is very good!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing authentic Italian food. It's a bit higher in prices but the foods flavor, quality and portions are WAY worth it. I had the snapper Romano and the plate was completely covered in pasta, sauce and the filet covered almost all the pasta. My wife had the lasagna and she didn't even put a dent in the dish before she was full. Well worth the price"}
{"text":"Awful awful awful. The bruschetta didn't even resemble what bruschetta should taste like. For my entree I ordered baked ziti and got baked...penne? When I asked the waitress where the ziti was, she said penne was \"all they had\". Seriously?? Would not recommend to any Italian lovers."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!!!  Don't let the location/building dissuade you this place is a hidden gem. I personally love their pasta but the pizza is also really good."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on yelp.  Service was very good.  Waitress was friendly, attentive and made great suggestion on the meal - go with the tomato cream sauce.  And the garlic knots were spectacular! Don't let them being a second basket or you'll eat them."}
{"text":"Riccio's has become our go-to for pizza and pasta. We've had delivery 3 times now and it's amazing how PIPING hot the food is when it arrives! We've had the pizza and I typically get the tortellini with alfredo sauce or spaghetti but today tried the fettuccine with the recommended \"pink\" sauce... sooooooo good! Love this place and their food and even their delivery is spot on! 
Never disappoints! 

PS do yourself a favor and get the garlic knots. Heaven!"}
{"text":"fantastic food and wonderful staff - and they deliver to ballantyne!!!"}
{"text":"My favorites: Chicken Marsala, house salad and garlic rolls... Love, love, love, great delivery service, food and atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in Charlotte. Tucked away in the touchstone neighborhood. Always friendly service."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant tucked away in touchstone.
The food is always good and the service friendly and attentive. 
My favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"ugh.  chicken parm. was awful.  chicken was like rubber.  I have never had chicken breast that bad.   We took it home and tried again the next day. terrible.  just like rubber.   garlic knots are not good.  please just have some plain Italian bread with nothing on it,  with butter.    pizza,  a 4  out of 10. 
Disappointed to say the least.   after going there for years."}
{"text":"So delicious. We walked in about 8:40pm after a day at Carowinds. We were craving Italian and this place got great reviews so we gave it a shot. SO GLAD WE DID. Our waitress was wonderful and the food was delicious. 

Calamari - delish. Flash fried and not greasy at all. Fresh and didn't need to bother squeezing lemon on top. Tender and perfect. Marinara sauce it's served with is great, too. 

Garlic rolls - hot, perfect little garlic morsels. The taste is not overpowering as some garlic breads can be. Be careful not to fill up on these guys!

Fried mozzarella - not a showstopper but good enough. May have been a smidge overcooked as there was a slight burnt taste.

I had the penne puttanesca - yum! Spicy and so flavorful and fresh. 

Husband had the fettuccine alfredo - creamy and coated The noodles perfectly. The Alfredo didn't separate and was perfectly seasoned.

We'll go out of our way to find this place the next time we head to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not sure when Riccio's changed their interior but it's much improved from 12-15 years ago when we used to frequent the restaurant for youth team parties. Food remains delicious. My husband had a huge piece of thick lasagna and I had an individual pizza. Lasagna is amazing and really enough for two people. Pizza was also delicious with a thin crispy crust and generous toppings. Will be back."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for lunch at Riccio's. Apparently serving lunch is a recent change for them. - both the Yelp website and Riccio's website show a 5:00 PM opening. As a result the restaurant was nearly deserted. I don't think there were ever more than two tables occupied while we were there. Still the food was good and the portions large. With the small attendance our server gave us a lot of attention, not only doing a server's duties but also visiting with us and exchanging experiences etc. Overall it was a very pleasant"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places! It's super hidden and I'm so glad we found it. Always good, quick service. Delicious if you love classic italian food. It's our favorite place to get pizza from too. It took us forever to find a good pizza place when we moved to Charlotte. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after searching the city for good Italian food. We hit the jackpot. Our waitress, Tina, was attentive and friendly. I ordered the Vodka Ravioli and it was the best I've had since moving to Charlotte. Overall, very satisfied with the food and service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best baked ziti in town -- and their Italian cream cake is outstanding. Waitresses are fun and friendly. The owner often stops by each table to check and see if everything is going well. Unpretentious and appealing  neighborhood place."}
{"text":"We ordered food for takeout here the other night and it was delicious! 
The dining room looks nicer than you'd think from the outside.
We had never been here before, so after perusing the menu, I chose the lasagna and my husband, the eggplant parm.  We waited at the unmanned bar (the hostess told us that it's bc they don't have a full liquor license yet- just beer/wine).  It was ready fairly quickly, maybe ten minutes. 
Get home, open the bag, and wow, everything looks great!  The lasagna is huge (i had thought it was kind of pricey until I saw how much food!) and smells amazing.  It had a classic yet unique taste- good quality ingredients.  Eggplant parm was good too.  The little garlic knots were tasty too.  Everything was hot and fresh.  We had ordered the garlic pizza bread thing since we didn't know about the garlic knots.  No need for that bc we were stuffed! 
Thanks Riccio's for great food and quick enough takeout.  We'll be back as we're right around the corner."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner on Saturday night, started with the antipasto on a huge bed of salad , followed by the chicken parmigiana for the Mrs and the snapper Romano for myself.
The chicken dish was very good and extremely generous in size,
The snapper Romano was exquisite , the best fish dish I have had here in charlotte.
For dessert we had cannelloni and tiramisu both delicious as well.
Our server an English lady was very attentive and friendly.
The garlic rolls are indeed a bit doughy but still very tasty.
All in all a very pleasant experience and we will surely return to this hidden treasure."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!! I just moved to Charlotte a couple weeks ago & love trying new / local places. It has an odd location that threw me off a bit, but we were so glad we still went in. Their garlic rolls are so soft, fresh and have the perfect amount of garlic. I had the cheese ravioli with butter sauce, my mom had the tortelloni bellagio, my dad had manicotti & cousin had spaghetti. Now how one would choose which of those dishes was the best would be impossible, because they were all so delicious I literally made myself sick eating so much! We went back again this weekend and everything was just as delicious. There was a shorter, blonde woman who seemed to be the manager. She was so sweet and welcoming both times and made sure everyone was taken care of with a smile. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Charlotte area in search for authentic Italian food with a side of amazing service! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, neighborhood feel, excellent service, what else could you want?! We met another couple here after moving and had a great time. Started with the garlic knots (rolls?) and they are to die for. Just get them. I ordered a chicken dish, hubs got lasagna, and the couple got carbonara and creamy ravioli and I wish I would have ordered one of the creamy dishes, they were both amazing! Need to come back to try dessert, great low key Italian place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food for a very reasonable price.  The menu is a collection of simple classics, but the execution is what sets a place like Riccio's apart from the Italian chains.  Terrific service too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Was here last night with the boyfriend after hearing a million friends rave about this place.  It was not crowded for a Wednesday night but while we were there four different pickup orders were processed so I see that it is a local favorite.  We had the Stracciatella Romana soup which is fancy Italian for delicious broth based soup with spinach, romano and I swear I saw some chives in there.  It was 4 bucks and completely delicious making me wish I hadn't insisted we share.  

For dinner, I had the Tortolloni Bellagio - I dont like tortellini at all but our super waitress recommended it so I said 'Sure'!  When it comes out you just have to be ok with the fact that you will weigh ten pounds more just looking at it.  It was heavy cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms  - delicious.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Parm which comes with a side of pasta.  I wish I had gotten that - the chicken breast was the size of his plate and the marinara was perfection.  

During the meal they also bring you these ridiculously mouth-watering 'garlic knots' or 'garlic rolls' which are hot out of the oven.  That is probably why I could only eat three bites of my heavy meal and claim I was full.  We were out of there for around 30 bucks and it was worth every penny since we will have a ton of leftovers for tonight!!  I am definitely going back to try their famous pizza too!!  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best neighborhood establishment you could hope for. Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is always fresh and consistent. I never been disappointed, and neither will you."}
{"text":"went twice for baked clams  both times very watery.
They had no macroni and clam sauce.

Service is good. Food rots"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, & friendly old world Italian. (1962) By that I mean, lots of tomatoes ergo somewhat acidic sauces. Minestrone was very bland, more akin to a tomatoey vegetable soup. Caesar was basically cold chopped romaine with tasteless parmesan (probably domestic) peels. It really needed garlic & a hint of anchovy to make it close to anything decent. Prices are commensurate with their quality tho if you're looking for relatively cheap eats."}
{"text":"This is old school Italian.  We've lived in Charlotte 8 years,10 minutes from this place but always passed by it. Not today, was in the mood for some traditional Italian. So glad we are here. 

We got the veal Marsala and pasta with vegetables in garlic and oil and everything was hot, presented well, and flavorful. We felt like we back in New York eating at a local joint that has been there for decades and with good reason. The food was just delicious. And or server could not have been nicer.

Don't let the outside fool you. Try this place, it's that good"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon deal for Riccio. The eggplant parmesan pizza is amazing and it has the best garlic roll.  If you want real Italian food, Riccios's is the place you want to go. It has plenty of parking space you can park. A great place for family to eat. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Riccio's has been redone on the inside. Really nice! They did a nice job. Only thing I would say is at twilight I couldn't tell if it was open from the parking lot.

The service is, as usual, great and the food is consistent and good."}
{"text":"One of those places that I'm bummed I haven't tried until now!

It's a small Italian restaurant in a little shopping center with nothing else really in it.  The restaurant atmosphere is very cozy, not fancy, with a nice bar area.  I loved the fact that they had paper over the tables with crayons because I'm kid at heart.

The fettuccini Alfredo was excellent and my husband loved his eggplant Parmesan.  

The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that the prices are a little high for the location and ambiance of the restaurant.  I will look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and found Riccios on Yelp and decided to try it!  It was a great meal, great service, delicious food and you can tell the owner and staff care a great deal.  It's tucked away, so trust your directions.  We would definitely eat there again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Such nice people, GREAT food, and they DELIVER!! Huge portions which you can have a blast playing with to make your \"personalized creations\". Can't go wrong here, we're so happy we found them. LOVE the veggie lasagna and that special pasta dish called \"Penne with chicken and vegetables\".  We prefer a lighter amount of oil & garlic and they were happy to customize our order. WE ARE FANS!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strange stripmall. Walking in, I sure wasn't expecting much. Let me tell you, this place rivals places that I have eaten in Italy. The food is great. We have been here multiple times and will be back. Extremely good and authentic Italian."}
{"text":"We were visiting my parents in CHARLOTTE and the usual Italian restaurant that we have been going to for the last 4 years stopped serving veal parmigiana and that is what my dad always liked to eat there.  So I searched yelp for a local restaurant that was reasonable and found Riccio's. We went on a Friday nite the wait was under 10 min.  The food and service was great. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and food came in a timely manner. We all had the veal parmigiana.  We also had house salad and fried mozzarella.
We will definitely be going back. I highly recommend this restaurant for good home style food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great birthday dinner. The Chicken Parmesan was exceptional. The staff couldn't have been more pleasant/welcoming and made this experience so very positive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place is somewhat hidden inside a village. It seems like it is more of a family restaurant.

Garlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering.   Calamari for apettizer was not even enticing. Bland and the marinara dip was lacking in flavor, too.
 
And came the entree. I made a mistake of ordering the shrimp marinara because it was the same sauce that came with the calamari. But how could i have known, we order the apettizer the same time with the entree. It was lacking that fresh italian herb and spices flavor. Although it was sprinkled with dried parsley and oregano on top. And it came with a ton of pasta! The chicken marsala was the only thing that tasted nice. 

I was disappointed, to say the least. It was out-of-the-freezer and out-of-the-can taste. I might as well reheat my Ragu."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. It always exceeds my expectations. The pizza is great and the bake ziti is one of the best in town. The place is hidden so it is easy to miss."}
{"text":"Riccio's was on my bucket list for a while and with a recent groupon I finally made my way to try the place with a friend.

My friend, Julia M, said they had expanded the place since her last visit and added a bar to the left and a few bar tables.  Even with the expansion, the restaurant is not that big but as we found out on a Thursday night, they certainly get busy.  This is a little gem.

The staff is really friendly here.  They are eager to give you their recommendations.  They will sit with you as they take your order and the owner himself will come out and talk to you to make sure you are enjoying your food. 

For dinner, I ordered a glass of Chianti, the lasaga  and a side salad.   The salad was beautifully presented and the lasagna was a huge portion that could easily feed 3 people.  The lasagna was very meaty and smothered with sauce.  It was the best lasagna I've had recently.  

This is what you expect from the locally owned places that have been here for years and have a large local following.  There's only a few problems I see with this place. 1--The shopping center needs a bigger anchor than Tuesday Morning so the restaurant gets more foot traffic.  There used to be a Food Lion here but it closed a few years ago.  2--The booths are kind of uncomfortable if you are a tall person.  The chair to table ration is a bit off and you feel the table should be a bit higher.  3--They should be open for lunch.  I would come more often then!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who's very picky about pizza, this place exceeded my expectations by. Far! In a weird shopping center but the food is amazing!! They also deliver."}
{"text":"Great. Have been here five times and love the veal parm. Friendly service. Will keep on returning. The best  food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"OK, so not sure it deserves 5 stars- probably more like a 3 in another City- I ordered the fish with alfredo sauce which sounds gross but is AWESOME.  The manacotti is really dissappointing.  I adore manacotti and was really sad it wasnt good, a friend had told me that it wasnt good here but I ordered it anyway- yuk. Riccios- if you hear this please revist this recipe and you could have a once a weeker in me.  Seriously- if you do change it send me a message and Ill yelp you again and spread the Riccios gospel.  BUT Im giving it 5 stars because they have excellent pizza- fish romano and DELIVERY!!!!!  Seriously Charlotte- WTF here, why does no one in this town deliver in the Southpark area??  So kudos to you for that.  Plus the delivery guy is great, really stands out!"}
{"text":"Oh Riccio's how I adore thee!  If you are looking for some good Italian fare then you should try this place out.  I've never gotten anything in here that was bad and most of the entrees are wonderful.

It's worth a trip there for the complimentary garlic knots alone...yum!!  I give them a solid 4 stars because while the food is great it's not really 5 stars great.  Also the atmosphere in the restaurant isn't the best in the world but considering it's in an older strip mall they are doing pretty good.

I haven't tried the pizza before but they seem to sell a lot of them and the wait staff and owners are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious pasta and bread! I wish I could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The kids always get the pasta and my wife and I usually get the pizza, although my wife likes to explore the menu, and she has yet to find anything she didn't like. As for me, I keep getting the pizza... it's fabulous, so why change?
The restaurant was recently redecorated and it looks great. Even with the new ambiance, it is a great place for the kids.
The garlic knots are great and the service is great."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service for a great price! 

We used a groupon and ordered garlic knots, calamari, and a large pizza (don't judge) everything was super fresh and delicious tasting. Their calamari is awesome...and so is the marinara it is served with. The portions are quite big so we had plenty to take home. The knots and calamari is enough for  a quick/inexpensive meal for two. The atmosphere is nice enough for a date, but casual/relaxed enough to pop in with the entire family. 

I wish it was a little closer to my house but when I am in the area I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  I was in Charlotte with my son for a scout event the next day and did not want to go to a chain restaurant.  Found Riccio's on Yelp and was so glad I did.  He had a small pizza, which had a perfect crust and left me drooling.  I had chicken parm and they did it perfectly, great sauce, good consistency, perfectly cooked.  Friendly but efficient service made it the perfect evening.  Would go back to Charlotte just to go to Riccio's."}
{"text":"Placed a carry out order and was extremely disappointed when I got home. My garlic knots and clams were burned.  I simply do not understand how a chef and server would allow extremely overcooked food leave the kitchen. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and am reducing my first rating as a 5 to a 2. You have to keep up the quality of service and food in order to keep patrons happy."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant but slow service. Waited over 5 mins before we even got greeted for drinks. Once we asked for drinks it took forever for the drinks as well as her coming back to take our order. Garlic knots were good. I got the lasagna. It was cheesy and the sauce was good. I asked her if the meatballs were homemade and she hesitated and said \"uh yes...\" Seemed like they weren't homemade with that answer. My fiancé got some Alfredo dish and the sauce was bland. He said it tasted like it was from a can."}
{"text":"Have driven by Riccio's everyday since moving to Chrlotte 6 Months ago and had heard good things so suggested my Wife and Son meet me there last evening to have a quick bite after work. Showed up about pm and we were the only ones in teh place, but within 15 moins it started to fill up fairly quickly. Wife ordered teh Lasanga and did not enjoy it. The lasanga noodles were thick and under cooked (actaully looked to be 3  noodles stuck together) and was pretty much tasteless. She only could eat 3-4 bites before giving up. I ordered the Spaghetti and meatballs becuase I couldn't stomach paying $21 for chicken parm.  There was something I didn't like and couldn't describe about the spaghetti sauce. Not sure if it was bad or just a sauce I didn't care for. Needed some more sweetness - very thick and dry. Meat balls were ok, but the ones at Hawthornes are miles better. My son eneded up with the kds chicken tenders which were very greasy and thin -- looking more like fried calimari. 
Service was lack luster as well - our server didn't seem particularly interested in being there and was handling the entire dining room so was hard to get her attention at times. All in all it was all just \"meh\". Not an Italian place to our liking and we probaby won't be back."}
{"text":"The family went to Ricco's for dinner. The service was good, but the food was marginal at best. We had the clams, lasagna and pasta with marinara. It was all too cheesy. I prefer Libretto's for a casual Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Riccio's. I love it!!! I have been going there since I was a kid and nothing changes so delicious and never disappoints! Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Ohhh, moan.
Just finished two slices of a 16\" pepperoni pizza, after eating the Antipasto A La Riccio with anchovies and blue cheese.
Best salad I have had in months. Should be able to share with at least two people. It was generously loaded with goodies and everything was so fresh.
My wife got the house salad and was quite content. 
1/2 a pizza to eat later tonight and tomorrow.
I simply love left over pizza!"}
{"text":"A Staple of Charlotte. The Best.
Riccio's is a Great Place for fine Italian food. When you consider the history of the time in Charlotte, NC- it rings true that his Flavors have stood the test of time. I first visited Riccio's in the 70's with my parents at its original location. Over the years locations did change, however as time grew on so has Riccio's. Better than ever, you Must have the Pizza. .
There are others but Only One Riccio's."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Chicken was chewy....one of the worst Caesar salads ever. Very overpriced. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice little off the beaten path place. Food portions were good but the sauce was a little too Chef-boy-R-D to me. Service was ok. Figure I would give it a try since I do love Italian food and it had good reviews. Now I've tried it. Maybe I just went on a bad night."}
{"text":"Came to this place to celebrate an important event with my entire family. The food was horrible!!!!!! My kids hated the spaghetti and meatball meal. It was so weird because that is my kids favorite food. I tried the sauce and it tasted like can tomato paste with literally no flavor! 
I ordered a clam dish and it was unsalted, watery, and super seafood taste as if the clam was about to spoil. The only food my family liked is lasagna but then again my teenagers have no taste of good quality food.

I'm giving one star for only the service. The server was friendly and took care of us. I will never come again and shocked that everyone gave this place high reviews."}
{"text":"First impression is that they want you know know how long they have been open. It's plastered on the outside/inside and the waitress told me in case I missed it.

The decor reminded me of a senior living center. Come to think of it the crowd did as well. But I'm thinking I've had plenty of good food at hole in the wall type places, but after looking around it just seemed like that keeping the place up was not a priority.

Was served relatively fast but overall it was poor. They were friendly but even while dealing with my table they seemed distracted and we're trying to do to many things. The service seemed consistent with my whole experience. 

Typical southern Italian food. My food was below average at best and so was my daughters.  Maybe they have the best pizza in the city and I just didn't order the right thing.  

I wasn't looking for anything fancy just something half way decent. Didn't find it here."}
{"text":"Family-owned where the owner is the chef. Got the manicotti and linguine with Alfredo sauce and both of them were amazing. Reasonably priced as well. Service was good, not great, but probably because they were busy and the server seemed a bit frantic every time she came around."}
{"text":"Been about six months since we were last there. Food and service remain great! And they have upgraded their dinning room - looks classier. They are also going to expand and add some outdoor dining. Wish they were closer to home!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for dinner for our second time, and it was just as good as the first. It's very out of the way, and can be a little tricky to find, but it's worth it. The food is great...fresh sauces, great flavors, and large portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Portion sizes are astonishing, prices are reasonable, and everything is delicious. The garlic knots are especially great. Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Man, this was great food! I'll update the review when we actually go to the restaurant for a dine-in experience, but I feel the quality of the food was well represented from our pick up order.

We got an order of Garlic Knots (half dozen, but there were more than 6... thanks Riccios! ), I got a Penne dish, and the lady got a cheese pizza.

The garlic knots were fantastic. This is what all italian places should aspire to be like. Doughy, good size, and had an awesome garlic flavor.

The penne with chicken and vegetables was off the chain, and the pizza was wonderful as well. Can't wait to return and try other things!"}
{"text":"Less than marginal pizza. I placed an order for delivery and my pizza arrived at room temperature. When I called because the driver was late, the staff member that answered the phone said \"he just left five minutes ago\" so my pizza should have been delivered hot."}
{"text":"First time  reviewing a restaurant without eating there.  
This was my second attempt to dine here. Reached here at 9:05 pm on Friday. Despite official time listed being 10 pm we were told restaurant is closed. Few people were dining , but reason was \"it was very cold and not many people here so we closed early\".  No sorry or apologies. 


Last year I had same experience at least door was closed so never had to get someone explaining. 


Really wanted to try their food based on all reviews but not sure third time I will hike to this location without checking."}
{"text":"Actually I feel the need to revise because after not being able to get my hero, we did stop in and have dinner. It was amazing, best I have had since we moved from CT/NY. I had the eggplant and my daughter had the chicken cutlet. Worth a try. Thanks for responding to my last review, but I still think you should have heroes on the takeout menu for dinner"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at Italian restaurants since I love cooking Italian dishes and am usually disappointed to spend on places I feel I can cook better. I was very surprised at the quality of the food. Very good!!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit a few days before the New Year and had mixed feelings after leaving. 

First, the place was incredibly busy when we walked in...don't mind waiting.

Took a while for our waters to come out...not a problem. 

Waited a while for the waitress to take our order....ok, i had great company so we will let it slide. 

However, the waitress communication with us when she did take our order was a bit choppy. When she did give us attention it was very minimal and I felt a bit unsatisfied with the experience. 

Calamari was solid along with the pizza we ordered.

It seems like they have their regulars and it maybe a family run establishment so we will give them another shot in the future but will keep this at a three star \"average rating\" until proven otherwise."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon that said for lunch.  Their website has no info about lunch hours.  Some other site stated 11 am - 2 pm. I have a few friends in & we go on a Saturday.  The place is locked up.  There's some sign that says they open at 5 pm.  

I email Groupon & they say the owners will call in the next two days.  They don't.  I get a refund.

I think livingsocial or similar had a deal afterwards & they at least listed the hours.  I think they are closed on weekends......so make sure you call ahead with their odd days & hours of operation.

And then these businesses wonder why they are eventually closed 7 days a week."}
{"text":"I do love Riccio's.

Back when we lived across the street (literally) from this little gem, we would walk over and pick up pizzas on the regular. Brought my dad when he visited from out of town. It's super small, run by friendly folks, and generally a wonderful hole in the wall location to grab a pizza. (It's in a strip mall next to Tuesday Morning and various other shops...oh, and the ever divey Touchstone Rose bar.)

My favorite item on the menu is the eggplant parmesan pizza. Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, but it's sheer perfection. Gooey cheese coupled with battered, thin-sliced eggplant and red sauce. When I'm hungry, it's what I crave. Can't stop eating...and a large pizza is gone in no time when split between the Mr and me.

I really appreciate that these guys put as much love into a take-away pizza as they do if you're dining in-house. The garlic knots are also winners.

I've never had a bad experience with Riccio's. So if you're in south Charlotte and looking for something to delight and surprise you with pizza goodness, look no further than Riccio's."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm very particular. It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Calamari were nicely done and tender. Tomato Sauce had a nice flavor. Our baked clams were way over done and my chicken Parm was toasted and covered up with sauce. Not horrible but the quality control wasn't there. The staff was very nice and attentive. I didn't return anything as I was starving so I just ate. I think I will try it again just to see if it was an off night. My dinner partners all said the same just ok. They wouldn't go out of the way to come there but all were willing to give it another shot. So net net all were ok with it."}
