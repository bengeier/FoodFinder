{"text":"I ended up there on Sunday night and had an enjoyable meal. I had originally planned to eat at Heart Sushi but that restaurant had a lineup, so I went next door to Boil Plus instead.   My meal consisted of the dinner for one with added sausage, and side orders of lobster chowder and sweet potato fries. I passed on the very interesting desert offerings as I am on a diet. My total bill including tax was about $31.   Service was fast and efficient and I was out of the restaurant in about 40 min. The server (I think that her name is Ashley) was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great customer service! They were very accommodating after we made a mistake on our order.   The lobster chowder was great! We also got the 1lb shrimp with signature sauce, and 1lb mussels with garlic. These were comparable to similar restaurants.   Menu has a wide variety of selections.   Would recommend this place to try out!"}
{"text":"Don't eat or order from this place unless you are ready to develop an addiction to their ramen! This is my new favourite restaurant for ramen and Japanese cuisine. Besides the ramen, I'd also recommend the baked mussels."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night for dinner, was seated right away. They have the typical iPad to order, I ordered the seafood combo for 1 which consisted of \"4 clams, 4 mussels, 4 shrimps, 4 sausages and fries\", I also got the lobster bisque. The server & Philip were both very welcoming and made sure everything was fine when our food came. The lobster bisque had a very good flavour, it was creamy and buttery, except, I had two problems with it, it was way too watery. It would have tasted much better thicker, also there was no lobster bits as most lobster bisques would have. The seafood was great, I tried the signature sauce, it has more curry flavour than the one at LA Boil. They are quite generous with their portions as well, I got more than 4 clams . I also requested to replace the fries with rice and Philip confirmed that with no problems. Overall, the spot is a bit small, minor adjustments to be made to the soup, but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place! good fix to my LA Boil craving, given that i didnt feel like driving all the way to Dundas. Customer service is great, we didnt feel rushed and Philip took care of our table and made sure that we had everything we needed. Best thing is that he made sure that we didnt run out of water, compared to other competitors that we had to keep reminding the server to NOT FORGET to top off our water... yet still being forgotten regardless.."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the last 2 months.  There's plenty of options to eat seafood in this place - from the bag to the sizzling plate, from boiled to baked, and there are items to please every member of the family, even the picky eaters.  Price is very reasonable from the ala carte to the set menus.  There seems to be only one main server in the restaurant but he makes sure every table is well attended and cared for.  Only complain is he smokes and he goes back serving his customers without washing his hands (witnessed this on my 3 visits).  Otherwise, this would be the place I'll keep coming back for the food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"The food was below average. For $20, we got 11 moderately sized crawfish which was extremely dry and bland. Definitely did not seem fresh...  For $6.95, the soft shell crab wasn't too bad, however I wouldn't get it again as it was heavily fried and most of it consisted of fried batter.   The cheese and macaroni dish literally just tastes like macaroni tossed in mayonnaise.   Clam soup was bland. Even the corn was bland (and not very fresh as the kernels were hard and it was not juicy).  The only good thing we got were the fresh oysters (6 for $12) which were decently sized and tasted very good :)     Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a couple times already and this has to be one of the best seafood places in Mississauga! The food is great and very reasonably priced, and the service is always quick and friendly! The combos are great so that you can get a taste of all the different kinds of seafood, it's great for sharing too!  Will definitely keep coming back and special shout out to Philip, who was very helpful with his suggestions and friendly conversation!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time for food to come! People started leaving because they cannot wait any longer. Food was okay, nothing special. Seafood fried rice was good, the rest are mediocre. Very unorganized. They served us food that we didn't order. If you ask for something such as water, you will have to tell them few times. I am not going back here."}
{"text":"Stopped for supper on curiosity and had a hankering for some seafood  Simple paper and bucket on the table setup that is very much unpretentious though to scope and scale of the decor and effort about to go down  - (also includes a hand washing station that is very much welcomed post meal )  Online tablet ordering a la cartel system which is easy to use and given it wasn't busy the owner took time to sit and chat   Calamari were well seasoned and breaded served on wood flats tapas style - worth exploring   Coconut shrimp were standard fare - neither over or underwhelming   The Lobster soup was nearly perfect and could double as a dip- both creamy thick and well stocked with lobster  that also made it doubly enjoyable while dipping calamari into it    The clam chowder is an admirable attempt that I'd prefer thicker to be heartier though it was well garnished and stocked with a balance of undersea goodies you'd expect I suspect a tad too many potatoes   The baked oysters , mussels and scallops and found happiness on a wood plank I've truly been without for too long - quite an enjoyable rich buttery  texture in each variation and bite that does our little mollusk friends justice but I'd highly suggest exploring and enjoying - and do so while it's warm and noble   The naked shrimp and snow crabs came promptly thereafter and prepared in garlic and butter in their own plastic bags - in a moment where you realize you're going to be pulling your shellfish from a bag - after the first bite you soon forgive the presentation .I normally don't enjoy shellfish in public given the labour and endeavour of pouring over every nook and cranny of extracting the sweet meat  but given the great market price and seasoning it's worth the effort - and I did use the bib and bare hands!   Dessert supplied via the Cheesecake Factory is a nice touch though after the copious butter I was ready for a fat nap  I'd actually suggest smaller portions at a better price point that would encourage sampling greater variety given the amplitude of choice  All in all -a fun and friendly place with friendly staff to enjoy some fresh prepared seafood ... just choose your company appropriately as it will get messy ;)"}
{"text":"Visited here on Family Day with my family and wait times were extremely long due to understaffing. Waited a total of 2 hours for all of our food to come out and it wasn't even that busy. My cousin had to catch a flight that day and had to leave early. Food was okay nothing special, broth for ramen was very light so I'd advise not to get it. Waiter's service was great because of how he handled the customers and actually told new customers that the restaurant was closed to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"You are in for a lot of fresh seafood in a choice of fantastic sauces when you sit yourself down to eat here. Do NOT be fooled by the clean, humble exterior when you pull your car up. Patrick suggested I get the single combination plate.  It had 4 BIG shrimp, good sized mussels, 4 clams, and 4 deliciously seasoned sausages.  Man, oh MAN was it delicious. They give you gloves, and you spread your meal on the plastic-covered table, then dig right in.  The signature sauce is distinct and complex as it accompanies the seafood perfectly.  I'm from California, so I probably won't be returning to this fabulous restaurant soon, but if you're in or near Toronto, you really should stop in for great food, clean atmosphere, and great personality from people like Philip."}
{"text":"After trying out Captain's Boil and LA Boil, my sister and I were interested in trying Boil Plus. The restaurant is quite small as it used to be a Subway.  We both ordered a pound each of the snow crab legs, 1 lb mussels, 1 lb clams, and Cajun fries. For all of our orders we chose the signature flavour. We were disappointed with the signature flavour. It didn't taste even close to good like the boil flavour at Captain's and LA. The kitchen forgot to add the Cajun sauce to the fries. We thought it would be Cajun seasoning and not a sauce. So they brought us a small container with Cajun sauce to add to the fries. The service was good but went down by the time we were done. Not sure why the service went down as it wasn't busy when we left.   We weren't a fan of this seafood boil restaurant."}
