{"text":"Obsessed with AZ Burrito. They have a great, authentic Mexican menu. The burritos are a must, especially the carne asada. Everything is super reasonable, but they definitely do not skimp on portions. Nothing else like it in the area!"}
{"text":"Best burrito shop in town. The machaca is amazing along with the green chili burrito. Great salsa and wonderful service. It can get packed at times."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos!  I always order the California burrito with carne asada.  It has all my favorite ingredients: carne asada, beans, rice, guacamole, & pico de gallo.  Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our go to places and I would have given five stars six months ago. I always order the veggie burrito enchilada style which runs about $10. I have no problem paying that amount for good quality but my last few experiences have not been good. My $10 burrito consisted of sour cream, rice, lettuce and expensive enchilada sauce. Gotta cross this place off our delicious list. Sigh."}
{"text":"Apparently their posted hours mean nothing to them. Bunch of kids closing up early on a Saturday night instead of treating their customers right."}
{"text":"#14 chorizo egg and potatoes. I've had 100's of burritos. I make my own chorizo at home. These guys nailed it. Everything is exactly as it is supposed to be for a pure, simple and classic breakfast burrito. And out the door for less than $5.00!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over a year and I absolutely love it! I always get a carne Asada burrito and add cheese. 
It's definitely better than filibertos. 
It's also a great deal, I get a burrito, chips and salsa all for $6! You can't beat that.  
The salsa is also amazing, if I could buy a big bucket of it I definitely would. 
The workers are absolutely pleasant to deal with, never had any problems with them."}
{"text":"Never really cared for 
Mexican food before. I am not a spicy food lover, so going to this place was an absolutely pleasurable discovery. You can make your own burrito and they don't even look at you funny! For the price and the amount of food you get, you can't beat it! I make at least 3 meals out of it..."}
{"text":"Really dry burritos. A bit overpriced I might add.  99 cent tacos are about four inches long, so not a very good deal. Bland. Staff is hardworking. I won't seek this place in the future."}
{"text":"I called in my order ahead of time...arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later...and it wasnt made. I had to wait while they made my order once I arrived which in turn made me late back to work. The outer layer of the tortilla was sooo rough I couldn't bite it off with my teeth. I ordered a carne asada burrito, the meat had good flavor but with everything else...I won't be returning."}
{"text":"To me, this place is almost like an upscale filibertos. It has a real quaint and nice home style environment that's very inviting. But sadly it stops about there. I tried one of the breakfast burritos because everyone else rants about them and to be honest it couldn't shake a stick at one from filibertos. The overall burrito was somewhat small and the potatoes were simply mushy, not really holding any form. I wasn't really pleased by my experience but I decided to try it another day (chips and salsa are chips and salsa, can't really mess that up)

About a week later I went back for a three rolled taco combo. Surprisingly, they managed to take the deep frying step and double the length of it I assume, leaving them in too long. I was at the end of the lunch rush is that helped any. What should have been crispy/soft rolled tacos turned into thick tough chips filled with meat.  I was too disappointed and just ready to wash my hands clean of the place so I didn't raise a fuss. 

All in all, it's a personalized filibertos that offers chips and salsa with most meals. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be healthy mexican food but either way it wasn't that tasty for me. I'm glad the rest of you had good experiences."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years... even better with the new location. My favorite is the beef chimi. Its always good food"}
{"text":"Just like any other Filiberto's. I don't see the big hype about this place. It's not authentic Mexican food. Anyone that tells you that it is is not an actual Mexican. Safe yourself the gas money & go to your nearest Filiberto's for the same food you'd find here. Prices & items are the exact same."}
{"text":"If you consider yourself familiar with the Tukee area... than you KNOW about the Original Burrito Co. Mainly I tend to go in the morning for one of their delicious breakfast burritos! Along with the burrito you get a small bag of chips and salsa... for breakfast you ask?! You betcha!! mmm mmm mmm. It does, tend to get pretty busy, so sometimes I call in an order ahead of time and pick it up to carry out. 

In response to Abe S's previous review, they are indeed moving to the formally occupied KFC. Mr. Delacruz, the owner seems to view this as an opportunity to expand and perhaps open a drive thru! YAY! I'm all for the drive thru expansion! Apparently \"spring\" is when all the major changes are happening... 

Don't forget your student ID, 10% off!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food, massive portions, and low, low prices."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot - been going there for over 15 years!! If you want in-expensive filling food - this place beats those \"other\" places by miles."}
{"text":"Bitchin place to refuel after shreddin Desert Classic. Salsa is holy grail material :)"}
{"text":"i came here for date night with wife - i was not impressed.  the food was very bleh...the price was ok.  One of the customer service ladies was a little rude and not sure about the menu but the other service lady was very helpful and corrected the mistake.  you can definitely do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious and amazing quantity for the prove you pay. Friendly employee. We will be.back"}
{"text":"Loved the #1 Red Chile burrito.  Cannot believe it's only $4.49.  I ordered it enchilada style ($2.75 extra) and it is VERY GOOD.  My wife ordered the Carne Asada - she liked it ok, but wants to try the Green Chile next time.  I am going to stop in one morning and pick up some breakfast burritos.  If they're anything like the #1 then I will have found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill!!! I know now why they get such mixed reviews. I'm thinkin y'all should read your reviews!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos hands down as well as tasty salsa to eat it with. I enjoy the egg, cheese, tomato, and union which you can substitute the flour tortilla for wheat."}
{"text":"The carnitas are to die for. And the tortillas are fresh... They have a salsa bar and also have a few daily specials like taco Tuesday any fish burrito Friday. I love the burritos chimi style as well."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I was in high school, about 7 years ago. It is super delicious and such an easy stop for a fast lunch/dinner or heck even breakfast. The staff are always so nice and welcoming. You can often find the entire phoenix police department stopping in their for lunch as well! Amazing place with good food and service!"}
{"text":"Excellent. We had the carnitas burrito which was really good. The green chili burrito was very flavorful but on the hot side, so if you enjoy spice this would be an excellent choice.  Great meal for the price and fast service. Would love to bring the whole family next time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to for burritos. My favorite is the #16. Have been going here for years and always try to stop by there for a meal when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burritos and tasty chips and salsa. Very good service too! Also a poke stop!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Although not as flavorful as Los Taquitos, they are at least very consistent and I can always know what to expect (and their horchata doesn't taste like it came out of a candy machine). Counter staff is always friendly. Oh, and the food is never too greasy -- always a plus."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food anywhere. The prices are very fair. The chicken burritos and Chimichangas are excellent. I have not tried the beef yet, but plan to soon. I am glad I found this place. It is near my work, makes an excellent place to have a quick lunch either dine-in or take-out."}
{"text":"I cruised to the Burrito Co. to try the breakfast burrito. I will have to say, the breakfast burrito is superior than the meat/bean burrito.

The breakfast burritos are a nice size, fresh and tasty. I would like to see more meat. I ordered my burrito with sausage and probably received the about 2 links of sausage.

The price is right, about $3.50 for the burrito."}
{"text":"To be fair, the food is ok. However, the service both on the phone and in person sucks!!! That's all folks. If you want to pay someone to give you unfriendly type service, eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place just off of 10 freewya and Elliot. Tortillas are best feature. Had a ham and egg breakfast burrito but could have done without the canned ham."}
{"text":"This restaurant was 1 i my favor place into we find cock roach in my taquito plate, I don't recommend this place anymore"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the Mexican music they played - it's fun and fitting. I hate going to an ethnic restaurant (e.g. Greek, Italian, Japanese, etc.) and they're playing top 40 lol. 

My order was up fast. Good food!

Simple menu, great combos."}
{"text":"Great food, the ladies at the counter are always complete bitches, they need to fix that!"}
{"text":"I have come here twice for breakfast. Both times the food was really good and the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is both times I have come the staff are very rude. They seem annoyed and appear to have a attitude. I would rate it higher if the customer service was better"}
{"text":"The Original Burrito Co. was another regular spot for us when we lived in Phoenix.  The portions were generous and the prices were more than fair.  They had a great variety of fare to suit your taste.  You can go authentic or a bit non traditional and it is always made right.  They make some of the most perfect breakfast combos you could want.
Since moving away we always use OBC as the measuring stick when we get burritos.  Still have not found any place that measures up.  
My favorites, the Fish Burrito, the Veggie Mixto and the Marco Polo.  But try them all!"}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place. They screwed my order up twice and the only modifications I asked for were no onions and black beans instead of refried. While I caught the black beans before I left I didn't the onions and it was loaded....ones that couldn't be picked out and were loaded in the burrito. For the $9 I spent it wasn't worth it at all. I will continue to keep driving by but I definitely wont be stopping anymore."}
{"text":"Dank"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable!  I stopped here for lunch after attending a meeting in the area.  Easy to find, just off Elliot and the 10.  Quick service, too.  You walk in and line up to order and then pay.  Find a seat and wait for your order to be called.  I had the Huevos Ala Mexicana - #12, the breakfast burrito.  I was sutffed, struggled to finish half, so you get more than what you pay for =).  Their green tomatillo sauce is delish and I thought it complimented my breakfast burrito perfectly. 

Definitely worth the drive if you want to try something different and don't want to break the bank.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Meh. The place is good.  Their salsa is no good though and that is the main reason I never crave this place.  Their California burrito and breakfast burritos are good though.  I hardly crave or request this place but it's edible and I wouldn't turn it down if someone wanted to go there.  There's better is all.  Casual inside and you order at the counter."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I ordered a beef taco with just cheese on it, made it a combo and when I got my order and bit into my taco I figured they must have gotten the order wrong because it didn't taste like beef and from looking at it I couldn't determine what it was. I went up to the counter and told them they got my order wrong and I was told that they mix their beef with potatoes so what I got was the beef taco. 1. I was not told this when I ordered it - had I known it would be made with potatoes I would not have ordered it. 2. When I sat down and looked at it closer I could not find any beef in the potato mixture. Not only did it taste gross but I feel it was a bait and switch. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. I didn't think you could mess up a basic bean and cheese burrito, but these guys did it. On top of the fact that the cashier was not friendly at all, but the ingredients were all separated. I spent 3/4th of the burrito eating just plain beans, then the last quarter had a bunch of cheese and a little beans. I won't go here again even if their other burritos are better. If you can't get a bean and cheese right, you're not even worth time of finding out more."}
{"text":"Good food even better service...the people there are very nice and the price is more than fare especially for the portion size...LOVE THEM!!!"}
{"text":"Best burritos around, and that's saying a lot from someone who can't get enough of chipotle. All of the burritos I have tried are awesome. Their tortillas are delightful, and the fresh salsa is to die for. My favorite is definitely the chicken burrito with green onion, peppers, and rice. The shrimp burrito is also grand. The staff could be friendlier, but service is quick even on their busiest of days. I love their new outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I don't even live in Phoenix, but when I am visiting, I go out of my way to eat here. The Veggie Mixto burrito is seriously the best burrito I ever had. I am utterly addicted to this place. The secret is the re-fried beans. Most restaurants just put pinto beans in their burritos, but the re-fried beans are key, and their flour tortillas are the best I ever tasted. If I could give them 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"The food was completely unimpressive. My husband had the carne asada burrito and didn't care for it at all. My kids had the tacos, but asked for refried beans instead of meat. Their refried beans were a disgrace. The only flavor you tasted was salt. They were way too bland. The other family we were with didn't really care for their food either, except the one that had the green chili burrito. 

Besides the food greatly lacking, the service was even worse! The cashier, a teenage female seemed grumpy. My whole family commented on her bad attitude. When I asked if there was chicken broth in the rice, the other cashier told her it's probably just water, just tell her water. The grumpy cashier at least asked, and we did find out they use chicken broth. I also asked for the kid's tacos to be ONLY beans and cheese. They ended up being a lot of the crappy beans, barely a sprinkle of cheese, and a ton of lettuce. Apparently that order was too difficult to relay...and that's probably why they say \"no substitutions.\" 

If you want good service and good Mexican food, go down the street to Macayo's."}
{"text":"I've been going to the burrito company for years. The #5 w/ guacamole, sour cream, and cheese is delicious. However lately I've noticed that they've started to slip with their customer service, and quality of food. Saturday 9/5/15 I came there with some friends, and we ordered our food to go, yet the lady that took our order gave half of our group their order to go, and the other half dine-in, and our receipts clearly said \"take-out\". That really wasn't a problem because mistakes happen. The issue was her attitude when we asked for our order to be wrapped to go. Clearly we didn't make the mistake so what's with the attitude??? Anyhow I didn't let that bother me I let it roll off my shoulders, and went back on Monday 9/8/2015. Before entering the facility there was a sign on the door that said \"Close early on Labor day at 2pm.\" We arrived around 12:30pm. We ordered the #5 (When made correctly is delicious), the cashier that helped us was very pleasant :)  However when we got our food it was COLD!!!! Now I expect the sour cream, and guacamole to be cold, however the carne asada was COLD, and hard!!! The cheese wasn't melted at all so that further let me know that the meat was cold. On top of that the tortilla shell was hard, and crispy...I was totally dissatisfied with my food. I wasn't going to write a negative review because I truly like this place. However yesterday's experience was disturbing. Remember they had a sign saying that they were closing at 2pm well patrons were trying to come inside, and order food but one of the workers locked the door at 1pm. Yesterday was a complete circus. I don't believe that I will be coming back here again. Which is sad because I've been coming here since 2002."}
{"text":"This 'company' serves burritos, cheap tortilla chips, with a butt-kickin' salsa bar. This is a lunch place in a low rent strip mall. I would only give this place 3 stars but their breakfast burritos are killer. Regardless of the time of day I usually get the chorizo, potato, and huevos burrito."}
{"text":"Decent food.
Useless staff.
Plenty of other and far better options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Fast, really good, watch how much you order because they are gonna load you up!!! Also you can take as much salsa as you want... fasy, real Mexican food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos! They make the burritos fresh to order, have awesome tortillas, and have fresh salsa to eat with the burrito or take to go. I haven't tried the lunch stuff yet, but I have had the breakfast burritos quite a few times and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a wee lad of about 10, and it's still one of my favorite places in town. The quality of the chips have gone down since they moved to a new building, but the burritos are still awesome. The only other bummer: don't have the free burrito punch cards anymore :("}
{"text":"I've been eating here routinely since 1997, so it pains me to write a poor review on OBC, but this is no longer the OBC where I've been a loyal customer for 20 years. I usually eat here 4-5 times a week between breakfasts and late weeknight dinners.

I can only chalk it up to the recent employee change, because I honestly don't know how else to explain the sudden drop in food consistency, accuracy, restaurant condition, and general service.

The past 3 times I've been in over the last two weeks, my enchiladas has been abysmal. The chicken is cut into big bulky cubes (never happened until recently), the innards are cold, and on the cheese enchilada, the cheese not even fully melted, but more a coagulated glob. (Let's forget for a moment this place actually charges EXTRA to get enchilada sauce on a flippin' enchilada. That's a long standing ridiculous added fee. IT'S AN ENCHILADA. IT COMES WITH SAUCE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT HERE!)

I also order 1 red and 1 green tamale every time I go in, they have been dry and cold as well, really tasting as though they were thawed and warmed up in the microwave.

I've been in twice now about 1.5 hours prior to closing on a weeknight. Both times the iced tea is not being refilled for the evening, which is a pain because they have good tea and I can't drink soft drinks or drinks with sugar. I don't think 7:30-8pm is unreasonable to think I can sit down and have tea with my meal. When I complained I was informed by the gentleman at the counter that no one will drink it if they brew up more tea at night and they aren't going to waste it for one or two people to drink. Seriously? I can't even fathom how little brewed tea costs, but to deliberately not have it available for later dinner diners is ridiculous.

I've also twice in the past month had an entree not prepared when my order was called. Both times the guy at the counter asked me if I was sure I hadn't already grabbed it from the counter, an asinine question since both times I hadn't even left the counter with my trays.

My other observation is they like to shut down one of the dining area trash cans an hour or so prior to closing, presumably so only one near the counter needs emptied at closing. It's rude if you're seated on the north side of the dining room, but whatever. The sad part is that repeatedly the only can left open is literally then overflowing with trash. Not just near the top. Overfilled, a nice mound piled well above the rim, with items beginning to spill to the floor and nowhere to fit my family's trash at that point.

I don't know what happened in the last two months, but I really am disappointed. This was a long time family favorite, and in a handful of weeks I'm now doubting how much longer I will keep trying to make this work out. Please, OBC, get back on track!"}
{"text":"Asked for no garnish and sour cream on the side, got garnish and no sour cream on my chimi. Nice job morons. Waste of $10."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars.
Had chicken, carnitas and carne asada soft tacos. 
All three meats were bland. As if it was cooked in lightly salted water. Chicken was not terrible but how do you go wrong with chicken? Carne asada was old and tasted like it. Carnitas was the worst. Super dry and tasteless. Service was ok. Not terrible. Just ok. Wait time was about 12 mins from the point of sale. 

I've only had things from the breakfast menu in the past and that I recommend. 

I don't enjoy making a bad review. I'm just so disappointed. They looked so good right out of the box!"}
{"text":"My lady and I went for dinner, last night.

I ordered a Marco Polo which is an egg, rice, shredded beef or chicken (I got beef) & pico de gallo burrito.  It was awesome, really awesome.

My lady ordered the Veggie Mixto which was beans, rice, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce & cheese. She loved hers, too.  \"Forget Chipotle.\", were her exact words.

These burritos were so good that I'm bumping this place up a star despite that as of 04/01/11, you don't get chips with breakfast burritos, anymore."}
{"text":"Bomb bean burrito! Salsa is really good too! Perfect amount of spicy. Absolutely no animal products in both pinto and black beans! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Winner of best food in AZ (my opinion) We come here just about every weekend, sometime even during the week to pick up the Marco Polo Burrito- we order with potatoes instead of rice and add cheese. The original burrito has always given supreme service with a smile and we've always gotten our favorite burrito cooked perfectly how we ordered it every time without fail. 

All the menu items are delicious you can't go wrong with anything that you choose. Be cautious on a Saturday morning you might have to wait a little due to the popularity of their amazing food... Trust me, it's worth the wait! 

Alternatively you can call in your order, when you arrive you won't have to stand in line and you'll be able to go right to the front to pick up the delicious food that is waiting for you don't forget to pick up a large drink the size is good for two people! 

This by far is the best decision to make when you're looking for a hearty delicious well prepared meal and great service to go along with it!"}
{"text":"$10 for a chicken and cheese burrito and a soft drink. Overpriced. I go to sit outside on the patio at night to eat and enjoy the nice weather and one of the employees comes to the patio and lights a cigarette while straightening up the chairs so I then had smoke blowing towards me with the misters helping it blow my way. Very unimpressed and very unprofessional for that to happen. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Earlier tonight I had a breakfast burrito with eggs and chorizo from here, and thought it was great. My family comes here often to quickly pick up some dinner to take home and eat. I am never disappointed with the food and it always meets my expectations. Their quesadilla is amazing. It's a little large and greasy, but it is one of the best quesadillas I've had and the cheese is delicious."}
{"text":"This place seems to be very popular with the locals, everyone that came in knew what to order, that being said is a good sign. It's a small place, I would not call it a hole in the wall, plenty of tables inside, big menu on the wall, a division the best part you can create your burrito as I did, the service is quick and attentive, bilingual, lol, so I ordered the #12 but instead of egg I requested papas (potatoes) instead, the burrito is made from a 14 inch flour tortilla, not sure if they make them here, but they taste good, the burrito is big and filling, my Burrito had Papas, onions bell peppers green and red, through papas were some what aldente, but I like them that way, if you like them well cooked you might have to request it, as all is done fresh, the bell peppers and onions were the same crunchy delight, they had red and green salsa, I am a sucker for the green and it did not disappoint, tomatillo bliss. Can't wait to try the meat burritos, and they offer a big selection from meaty to veggie. I would really recommend this burrito joint."}
{"text":"Had the California burrito with carnita meat, was a good meal. I would prefer to any other Mexican food the state of AZ.  has!!! Guess I like tex mex,cause the sinoran food here just sucks!!!"}
{"text":"People that live in the east valley can sometimes talk fondly of this place. I never really realized it, since my only experience was of those occasions when I popped in and bought a quart of the red salsa, which is amazing. 

So we decided to give it a full on evaluation. Chicken tacos and enchiladas, was a solid baseline.. or so I thought. Here is where it becomes tricky. The tacos was completely tasteless, and could go unnoticed completely if it wasn't for that super duper hard taco shell that surely did not improve the experience. Rice and beans did nothing for me, and the enchiladas - which was the highlight of the meal - was flavorless and uninteresting that too. 

Now, I must start to evaluate why people raises this place to the high heavens and I conclude that there are two possibilities. Either it used to be the bomb and quality has degraded severely. Or it used to be the bomb out of pure lack of competition, and people climb to it's former relative greatness that simply doesn't hold up to today's standards. 

Either way, if you like this place - don't worry, I will not be holding you up in line. I will not be there."}
{"text":"This is a solid burrito joint. Over the years they have crept up on the prices but the quality remains the same.  All food comes with salsa and chips. No thrills, no frills just decent food to fill you up on your hungriest days. There's no drive-through so I recommend calling ahead and picking up your food if you are in a rush. The service is average, and most of the time they keep the tables clean during lunch rush.  My favorite is the Barbacoa enchilada style (about $7.50), it's filled with tender Mexican BBQ beef, green onions and tomatoes. After eating this I usually sleep at my desk for the rest of the afternoon. PS- they don't accept AMEX."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, alternating between tacos, barbacoa burritos, and the chimi.  They've all been fantastic, and the place is just a nice quality little mexican spot.  

If you live near here or have the opportunity to stop in, it is probably one of the better places in Arizona."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite. Grabbed the chimichanga plate (beef) it came with beans and rice. Their salsa was very good from the salsa bar and the meal came out with chips for under $10. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here! Stay away! Got our entire to go order wrong and had to wait 20 minutes after i got there which was 10 minutes after phone call for the food we were looking forward to but never got. Crappie food for the wait. Friends had eaten here before and recommend to us. Placed order by phone and prepaid by cc. Got there and had to wait cuz they forgot one order. Ordered beef tacos combo but got bean n no combos. Went down from there and not very good food anyway. Will never go back and hope my friend got his money back since we never got what we ordered."}
{"text":"Best carne asada burritos and homemade salsa I've ever had!!!! Authentic and I love the salsa bar when you eat in. If you're in the mood for Mexican, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place was so cheap and so good. This is how you do it. step up to the counter order from the easy to read menu and pick up your food when its ready (chips & salsa included free). You can get your burrito Fried, Wet (enchilada style) or regular. I recommend the red chili sauce.  I will be back very often."}
{"text":"The new digs look pretty nice and are somewhat of an improvement over the old spot.  When I say 'somewhat', what I'm alluding to is that there is often a certain charm that remains in the details of any original establishment. 

In this case, the little patio area with the fountain is no more.  But on the whole, it's a step up.

Chorizo, chorizo, chorizo.  Somebody in the talk forum started a thread about chorizo and another yelper mentioned The Original Burrito Co as having the goods.  I had to find out.

The verdict: it's good and I like it.  

Their chorizo is about what you expect when you close your eyes and conceptualize what chorizo is supposed to taste like.  It has a subtle spiciness but is not too vinegary or salty.  When folded into eggs dashed with papas everything works together in a complimentary cloud of Sonoran awesomeness rolled into a tortilla.  

I had '#14:The combination - chorizo con huevos y papas'.  No regrets.

Two salsas are available in the salsa bar, a red and green, along with sliced, pickled jalapenos.  I like the fact that they give you a small bag of chips with your order.

I'm definitely coming back to try their red and green chile as they boast both of these entrees to be made with a New Mexican flair.  That could be a critical turning point in my criteria but I'll remain the optimist and base my return on the delicious breakfast burro I got here."}
{"text":"Ok. This place needs to be on TV. Its also one of those places-for those of us who live in the East Valley-that is a #STAPLE. Worthy of its own hashtag even. Worthy of Best Of Phoenix. And quite frankly, the reason why you should never go to Chipotle, or any other imitation. This place is real.

Real enough to run into the owners of a business that has been around for 30 plus years. It makes a difference when the ownership cares so much, and it shows up in the service. I've never not once experienced less than super friendly service. Customers are welcome here, and there are plenty of regulars as a result.

My writing won't do the food justice, so I'll just say that you are getting the quality of food normally you would have to sit down and wait for; not to mention, the kind of food that would give your wallet a beating. However, you'll leave this place with your wallet not having as much as a scratch. Its all because they know how to offer value here.

Lastly, expect authenticity when you eat at this clean and comfortable establishment. The flavor that lands in your mouth from their artfully made carne asada burritos is no doubt due to REAL recipes. This ain't no \"On The Border\". 

Plently of mexican restaurants to choose from in the area. Plenty of perpetrators. Stay away from those and eat here :)."}
{"text":"Oh, Burrito Co . . . you are SO not helping my waistline by being two blocks from where I work . . . 

Their carne asada burrito is big and delicious.  The carnitas burrito was so-so when I ate the first half, but 7hrs later when I ate the second half, it was excellent.  Maybe it just needed some time to jell.    

The beef hard shell tacos are very good.  The beef enchilada is a great deal at only $3 bucks

Their taco salad is also a steal at $5, it's a two meal salad.  Nothing fancy, but delicious, and the shell is perfectly fried and ungreasy

The red salsa is fantastic with almost enough heat.  Very fresh tasting, with plenty of cilantro and some diced onion.  

I've gotta remember to try the horchata and the tortilla soup the next time I stop in.  

It's probably the safest place in town at lunchtime, because there are almost always cops eating there, which is a good sign"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Salsa made fresh everyday! My parents have been coming here since they opened over 25 years ago before I was even born. And my husband, who is of Mexican descent, also loves this place. Must go if u love great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Hello ppl, im from out of town and saw this place on yelp. The comments are great and i came to see it for myself. I just should have stayed away. The food was cold and it took them a long time to have my food ready. The food was so bad that i had to run into the rest room before i went home."}
{"text":"So I've gota bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over. I broke that mold the other day and decided to get a green chilie burrito.

NOT. DISAPPOINTED. DELICIOUS.

Quite honestly, I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this place. They are always friendly, always quick, and the food has always been good. Are people mad that they have to pick up their food at the window or something?

I still love the salsa too.

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Dirty floor, filthy salsa bar, gastly restrooms.  I'm thinking this place is over due for an inspection *nudge *nudge

Look past all that, get your food and it was so-so.  I was over expecting due to the extreme yelps.  

To each there own right, maybe it was just hard to enjoy the meal with all the screaming kids & parents that hardly noticed.  Or the messy setting.  We'll never know."}
{"text":"Ordered burrito with \"fresh NM Green Chile\". Sadly I received only green bell peppers. Reported order made incorrectly but was told bell peppers are Green Chile (not even close). Posted by a native New Mexican that recently moved to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yuck, something has gone downhill here.  Tried it for the first time in a very long time again today, and it is not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy! 

It is right across the street from work so I go here once or twice a week. They have really good breakfast burritos for around 3 bucks. They're pretty filling, so it is a great value. They also have good lunch burritos, also reasonably priced.

The staff is always REALLY friendly. I usually pick up to go and it is pretty quick. You wait a bit longer during lunch rush, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It's a dive and it has delicious food. I go almost weekly. If it was cleaner it would definitely merit five stars.

I love the 36. Love it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The chicken burritos and the carne asada burritos are amazing! My family has since moved away from the Ahwatukee area, but any time we are in the vicinity, we make it a point to stop there."}
{"text":"My brother and I stopped here in the half an hour interim between his soccer practice and my school's musical. I had heard good things, but was a little wary about it. I was wrong to have avoided it!
We walked in, and the menu was large and obvious right in front of us. My brother looked and looked for something he wanted, and finally settled on an option, but had originally had his heart set on a breakfast burrito. We got up to the register (no line, yay!) and I saw that they had breakfast burritos, but was unsure if they were still offering them at 6:30 PM. My brother asked (and he is very shy about asking people things, so he speaks quietly and a bit unsteadily) and the woman behind the register was incredibly patient and kind. 
He got his breakfast burrito (eggs and bacon and nothing else in a tortilla, and he absolutely loved it) and I got a BLT burrito (which sounds odd, but is fantastic. Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) and everything was great.
Their seating area was cute, and had the patio not been under reconstruction, it would have been perfect to sit outside.
Go to the Original Burrito Company, because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had!"}
{"text":"Wickity wickity whack!

Couldnt and wouldnt finish our meals.

The chicken in the rolled tacos tasted like mush.  We thought we were given mashed potato taquitos but it was just really blended like chicken.  Gross.

The fish taco was bland.  No sauce, thick tortillas, piled high with cabbage.  Not worth 3.50.

The cholo burrito was okay.  Shredded beef, guac, and lettuce.

The chips were hard and not fresh.  The salsas were uninspired.  

Do not accept Discover Card the only credit card company in America that doesnt out source its work over seas.

I would not come back and will not recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Burrito CO is Okay...

How can you go wrong making eggs, bacon, sausage throw some canned chiles together whip it up in a flour tortilla then charge 6 bucks. It's a combo hard to screw up, I go here when I don't want to cook, and don't want Dennys or Ihop or don't have the time, and stop in and get a breakfast wrapped in a tortilla to go...

convenient yes,,, the best breakfast burritos in town? No..."}
{"text":"Another recommendation by a fellow co-worker of mine!

1. They need to wipe down tables and clean up messes in the restaraunt more often, because of the volume of people coming in and out, it's pretty gross to not be able to find a clean place to sit down and eat.

2. FYI: They only accept credit cards for purchases of $5.00 or more. Weak.

3. Their Carne Asada plate (#21) only comes with ONE, yup, uno flour torilla for the entire place. What?!  : / Good portions of food, it came with rice and beans.

B+"}
{"text":"Great Mexican place. Been in Ahwatukee forever. Great menu and fantastic breakfast burritos served all day, all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love this place. I also love that if you have the Door Dash app, they will deliver from here. My favorite is the green chile burrito. The chips are pretty much like you would get anywhere, but their burritos make up for that! The breakfast burritos are great too!"}
{"text":"All hat no cattle.  Boy has the quality here went down. Breakfast burritos here this morning. Bacon egg and cheese was ALL egg, very few pieces of bacon bits and had to really search to find a small small bit of cheese. Same with sausage burrito. Very bland no flavor. Been coming here for years...no more"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite before jumping on the 10 to head back home. The hubs and I both had the chorizo, egg, potato burrito. It was really good. Usually chorizo can be greasy but this was not. The salsa bar was yummy as well. If your looking for a quick bite come here and give it a try."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp reviews!  I would have never given this place a glance set back in the corner of a strip center - what a find!  It's a regular lunch stop now - I'll never be able to enjoy Chipotle again!

Excellent burritos at an equally excellent price - I'm working my way through the menu.  Everyone that works there is very nice, salsas are excellent, and a great patio to sit outside and not feel like your in a parking lot."}
{"text":"I have some mixed reviews about this place. I had the red chile pork burrito. It had good flavor, but when you take it to go the chile settles to the bottom, so it is best to eat it on a plate. Lots of meat and chile in this large burrito. Definitely good for two meals. Wish it has some cheese in it. This visit we were greeted my the most unfriendly cashier. Older lady with glasses. She did not seem welcoming, or in anyway too happy to answer any of our questions. My friend and I did notice that she seemed to be very nice to all the men. Women, had to go to the other staff there to get their needs met. She told my friend that her burrito did not come with chips when the menu clearly states that chips and salsa are included. I got a tiny bag of chips, and my friend got a much larger portion. Inconsistent. The salsa is tasty but does not really bring the heat.

I did try the carne asada burrito with guacamole another day that week. AMAZING!! Huge and definitely can take you for two meals or you can share it. 

The following week work brought in breakfast burritos for the staff. I had the egg and sausage. Not a fan. Too much egg, did not like the sausage. I would not order this again. 

The prices are reasonable. If you use credit cards, you do need to spent at least $5.00 or you won't be able to use it, or even a debit card too.

I did not ask for a container to take salsa away because I'd already been warned not to ask."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the raves are about.  I ordered the fish burrito - thin fried fish inside my burrito and just OK on the flavor.  As my husband & I were sitting at a table waiting for our order to be called - a worker was walking by every table around us sweeping the floor.  Probably should wait to do this when there aren't people eating at tables - kinda gross.  My biggest issue is that I LOVE carne asada fries so I ordered them here.  Well as I posted in my pic - I got uncooked floppy fries covered with a thin puree of avocado with cotija cheese chunks mixed in, topped with about a 1/4 cup of carne asada and pico de gallo.  The floppy fries killed me.  It's unforgivable.  They can fry a decent tortilla chip (maybe their pre-bought) so why not fry a crispy fry?  I cannot revisit this establishment sadly since I cannot get the taste of uncooked fries and liquid guacamole out of my mouth.  Sorry Original Burrito company."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, and affordable mexican dishes with fresh ingredients. Perfect to stop for a quick take-out."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible customer service. I continue to give them business because it's close to work but otherwise I wouldn't bother. Nothing like being treated crappy while spending your hard earned money. Several of my co-workers have had the same experience."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos here are amazing. I always get the #12 with potatoes. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they charge you extra to substitute things, charge for extra salsa, etc...otherwise, my co-workers and I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I live close to here so it is easy. But I kick myself in the butt every time I go. Every time I order to go, I get home only to find out they short my order. Tonight I ordered a taco salad. I think I had maybe a 1/2 cup of lettuce hidden under a blob of sour cream and blob of guacamole. Don't get me wrong...I love everything that is part of the salad. But key word...salad. It was one big mush. I won't say I will not return. But in the future I will ask for lettuce and sides."}
{"text":"The only gripe I have is that it can be hard to find for someone who is eating there for the first time.  I've lived in Ahwatukee all my life so this is not a problem for me.

The Original Burrito Co. is a great little mexican restaurant located in an otherwise forgettable strip mall (A liquor store and Gold's Gym being the anchors).  The food is priced well and you can easily feed two for under ten dollars.  The burritos themselves are generous in size and tasty, to boot.  I really like their green chile and carne asada offerings.

The inside is very small, looking more like a take-out place than a real restaurant.  You can sit outside, however, and I would recommend this is the weather permits.

There is no other place in the area I'd rather get a quick mexican meal, for sure."}
{"text":"I loved the carne asada burrito! Guacamole is by far the best I've had regarding any Mexican restaurants!!! I would've gave 5 stars, but yet didn't have the selection of sauces to add to burritos. Overall I would still recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is a go to place for us for breakfast since they allow dogs on the patio. We love the breakfast burritos with peppers and tomatoes. Chips and salsa are sometimes light on chips. There can often be a very long wait on Saturday mornings. Sunday mornings are better."}
{"text":"First time coming here and just a spur of the moment find as my dad and I wanted food before heading to Tucson. The prices are amazing- so reasonable. And the portion size of the food and taste, wow! He got a breakfast burrito and I got a Hatch New Mexico green chili burrito. Spicy, good, hot and flavorful. I topped it off with sauces and jalapenos from the condiment bar. It came with some stock chips, nothing good but the salsa made them edible. The burrito however, yum! Fast service. Seemed like a hopping place, lots of people coming in. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"meh, wasn't anything impressive.

Breakfast burrito was ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. I was in from out of town and I have to say we definitely have better burritos in LA than here.

Make a change Burrito Co! put a little more love in there!"}
{"text":"Burrito Company is one of me and my fiancee's favorite places in Ahwatukke. Especially now that they moved into a new, larger building, they are super fast and have delicious food! Something that sets them apart from other places is that they offer whole wheat tortillas, an option that I really like.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and we love that you can call in your orders for pick up! I would definitely recommend the Burrito Company and would also recommend that you try the #5 (carne asada burrito)!"}
{"text":"There is a note at the bottom of each page of their menu that reads\"No Substitutions\". They are not kidding at all. That is a deal breaker for me. 

Sorry, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos here are excellent. Green chili with eggs and potato or the chorizo burrito is the way to go. Good enough that I may try dinner here again... Maybe"}
{"text":"Viewing all these great reviews, leads me to one conclusion, people don't know what a good burrito taste like. I had a machaca burrito and it was way too dry. The meat was shredded but it was clumpy (is that a word?) and would stick to the roof of my mouth. My boyfriend had a taco of each of their meats, and he was surprised that even the carne asada was bad. Who messes up carne asada?

Take it from a Mexican who knows Mexican food and skip on this joint."}
{"text":"This place charges you for EVERYTHING!  You're better off ordering your enchiladas with NO SAUCE (just to avoid extra cost)! You want chips? Guess what....it's gonna cost you too! And not to mention the quality of there food has been a disappointment. I really liked this place, but over the past few months I have kept my hope up that things will get better. But unfortunately we have to part our way....."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I don't feel that they lived up to the reviews. Everything was fine....but not spectacular. I love salsa and they charge for extra \"to go\" salsa. :("}
{"text":"Had The #62 Carne Asada Tacos. Ewww so freaky greasy, I picked it up and the tortilla fell apart from it being so soft from the grease. The rice had no flavor what so ever. The beans were ehh. The chips were flavorless. I don't know who is cooking this food but it's definitely not mexican food. NO BUENO!!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for about 4 years now and so far this is my go-to burrito spot. A buddy of mine lives out in Ahwatukee and I make it a point to get some burritos here every time I'm out there. The ingredients are extremely fresh and NOT GREASY, which I like. 

Try ordering french fries in your burrito, it is delicious.  

The salsas are very fresh and perfectly spicy."}
{"text":"Best place for burritos for many years now. They have excellent breakfast burritos and great carne asada. The salsa is fresh and full of flavor. Everything we've tried has been great."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for breakfast burritos. This was the best chorizo burrito I have had since moving to AZ. The salsa was tasty, not too spicy but with lots of flavor. Loved the guacamole and I am pretty picking when it comes to my Guacamole. I will make the trip again just to eat here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time in August 2017. We got burritos and 2 soft tacos. We thought all of the food was good. Not greasy at all. It's nice the burritos come with chips! We thought the green salsa and red salsa were very tasty.  I was so full. We would definitely good back."}
{"text":"The salsa was just not for me. But the burros were good. Would come back for more. The green salsa was ok. It just wasn't hot but had a good taste but it was missing the spice. The burros are huge-ish but good.

Second time coming here was great! Loved the burro! 

Now onto my 3rd time for breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Fish burrito is a no go, I can't imagine any dish they have with fish would be good. But I love their shrimp tacos and burritos. Pretty pricey, $2.75 for one taco(?) it's a nice once in a while place to dine though."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices! I've been going to OBC for the last 17 years. 

2 stars cuz since the recent past, asking extra plastic cups for salsa togo is frowned upon."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito and they got my order wrong! Also , it wasn't good at all . Been here a couple times and can't complain at first but this time it was bad ! Flavor wasn't there....probably won't be back plenty of better burritos places out there for sure !!"}
{"text":"First of all the service is horrible when I ordered food on the phone the lady seemed to be annoyed when I went to pick it up she seemed like she hates her job know about the food it was one of the nastiest burrito me and my husband ever had and the tacos nothing but veggies a small amount of meat and no taste I was hoping it was going to be good but it was a fail for sure I will never go back"}
{"text":"We were here when there was a happy hour special on carnitas and carne asada tacos. The place was pretty busy so we were surprised that the meat was over cooked, as if it had been sitting out awhile. 

I ordered my taco without onions but it arrived with red onions on it. The cashier insisted there weren't onions on it. It went so far that I picked out an onion and put it up to her face and said \"smell it! It's an onion!\" (Meanwhile my husband is enjoying a good laugh) She did smell it, apologized and asked the kitchen to remake it. I know minimal Spanish but I could tell they were arguing about it with her. Then they smell it and agree to make me a new taco. Seriously - couldn't you SEE the red onions or at least look before arguing about it?

The hatch chile salsa is spicy but good. Red was typical, nothing special. My husband said his carne asada was dry and bland. 

Based on dry meat and arguing about what they're serving me, not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Burritos are decent. I've had some horrible tasting ones from other places. This is the 2nd time I've order from them. The first time they were very helpful and friendly, however, today, 11/29/17, the gal that answered at 9:00am was extremely short and rude. Ugh!!! Now I don't know if I want to order from them again. Why do mean people work with the public??"}
{"text":"Omg such bad customer service first off! Secondly all of the booth tables where dirty had to clean my own!! Order was wrong! Me and my boyfriend ordered two enchilada combos only got one but we were both hungry so we shared and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse! Ain't covered the overflowing trash.."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was in high school....and I love this place! You can't beat their breakfast burritos. They are like $3, they are HUGE, they taste amazing (tortilla, eggs, cheese, meat...how could you go wrong?), and you can get them any time of day (my favorite part). I always stop by this place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great Burros, interesting creations and all at a good price."}
{"text":"I wanted a chicken quesadilla for lunch today so my husband went to get me one. When I got home I started eating it and discovered it tasted weird. I opened it up and there was NO chicken and barely any cheese . I called them and the girl said they would remake it and I asked for sour cream on the side. They even made my husband return the messed up one I had already bit into. He gets home this time they didn't give me sour cream . I gave up at that point . Doubt I will go back ."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here twice now, and I've tried three different burritos. The burrito with machaca and eggs is by far my favorite. The service is a little bit slow, but everything is made fresh. It's a family-owned and family-run restaurant, which I like a lot-- I like to support local businesses. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for a year now, and these are the best burritos in town. They are amazing every single time! I live in North Scottsdale, and I drive down to Ahwatukee every couple of week."}
{"text":"Very great authentic Mexican food. I love their salsa and any of their burritos.  Family owned restaurant, great people.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I will not eat a burrito anywhere else.  The number five, cheese, sour cream and guacamole is hands down the best burrito ever.  I eat here at least once a week.  The homemade salsa is to die for and the employees are great!"}
{"text":"I hate to add this review, as this HAD been one of my favorite places, but wow, the quality (AND THE QUANTITY!) have gone way, way downhill here, while the prices have gone up. Sadly, the last few times I've ordered my food, the meat had been dried (burnt carne asada one time) and the tortillas soggy. The guac was NOT fresh, and is more of a ..cream? now instead of actual guacamole. 

I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food, which is a lot more authentic and flavorful than your typical Mexican restaurant. The burritos are great as well as other items on their menu. Their salsa bar is fresh and flavorful. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order on the menu.  

The Original Burrito Company is in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you. The food is served in red plastic baskets and the cleanliness is about what you might expect, verifying its authenticity. Still, the price is very right for the meal. The employees are all really cool too. 

This is a local favorite for Ahwatukee. But if you are expecting a bombshell, you may be disappointed. The Original Burrito Company is good and reliable. You can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos around at a great price. Ordered 30 for a company event and they were ready on time as promised!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burritos.   we came 40 minutes before closing and they where wrapping things up even though they were busy, no tea no salsa bar.  

My wife's veggie burrito was stuffed with rice like they we're getting rid of left overs.  The beans where dry.

My carnitas burrito was okay but little meat.

Won't come back."}
{"text":"It was minutes before a long flight, and I was quite mad at the airline, I figured what better way to get even than the aromas and after effects of a huge burrito!

I was surprised how busy this little store front was on a Saturday at 7. It is not fancy, it is a step above your average berto/beto experience. There is a large menu on the wall that takes a bit of time to get a handle on. there is indoor and a large patio for seating. 

I went with the fish burrito that some of my fan boyrito friends suggested.  less than $5

My burrito came the tortilla was soft yet had a nice crust from grilling, the burrito had a sufficient amount of fried fish, lettuce and the fresh taste from peppers and onions. It came with some nice thinker chips. There is a salsa bar with some great salsa to compliment the chips but to my chagrin no drinkable picante style sauces.

Also note they are moving soon to a remodeled KFC in the same complex so the patio arrangement may change.

There was quite a wait conciderign the natrue of this plaace,"}
{"text":"Came for taco Tuesday! The carne asada street tacos are awesome!!  ^_^ Also had a chimichanga which was probably the best one I had, the meat seemed a little dry, but since it was deep fried I suppose that's why.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"One of my first stops when I come back to Ahwatukee! Best burritos ever! If you've never been here you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened. The food is usually spot on and delicious.  Over the years they have moved locations to accommodate their growing popularity. The food has taken a hit unfortunately and isn't as good as before. Probably because they are so busy now a days.  However, I still love their food and love to see Margaret in the kitchen after all of these years :)"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada burritos. The nachos are good as well,  a big enough order to share with another person.   Call in your order for fast service especially during busy lunch times."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I live right around the corner, so I go here often. Their California burrito and carne asada fries are amazing. They put cottage cheese in their guacamole which sounds weird, but it tastes great. Their salsa can be spicy (which I like), so beware. Just a tip...if you use your debit card, your purchase must be over $5."}
{"text":"One of my fav places for good Mexican food. Authentic music playing and it always smells like something wonderful is cooking. The interior is decorated with nostalgic Mexican and gives a slight feel of Mexico. Their menu is plentiful with choices and everything can be modified to your own tastes. Be sure to have some nopalito in your burrito!!! Employees are super friendly and always happy! Burritos are big and one is almost too much for one person. This is my go to place for burritos!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sorry Yelp, but Burritos are a food group! Especially for ME!

I just starting working in the area and have been in search for a place for breakfast, lunch and good eats. So I went to my trusty Yelp app, and was not disappointed to find The Original Burrito Co.

I have found my new Favorite Breakfast Burrito of all time! Number 12 Huevos Ala Mexicana: Eggs and some veggies and cheese. It is truly a well put together burrito, hits the spot every time. 

Don't forget the salsa! It is one of the top salsa's I have had!

I have ordered a few more items off the menu and I have enjoyed them, but nothing as wonderful as the number 12!"}
{"text":"Normally you get two to go salsas for each item that you purchase.  Ordered two burritos to go and got two baby salsas and then was charged $.70 for two extras!"}
{"text":"Old faith. 
Excellent Mom and pop establishment. Delicious! Food is fresh and authentic, warm, welcoming customer service. Neighborly vibe."}
{"text":"Have been going here since I've been a freshman in high school , and have not stopped . Definitely a good quick Mexican food option . My personal favorite is the carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"This place used to have great burritos but it's gone downhill. Increased the size of the tortilla and decreased the amount of the contents.  Burrito is all tortilla in nearly every bite.  Prices ok but maybe that's the reason."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and got the #38 fish burrito... So delicious. Good price and huge burrito. Food was ready pretty quick. Also tried the Green Pork burrito... Try only if you like it spicy!! This place is so good that my friends visiting from Ohio have demanded this daily!"}
{"text":"Overall we were really disappointed with the quality of the food here. The bright yellow corn chips reminded me of store bought taco shells. The salsa was spicy, but not flavorful. The beans and rice were bland. The quesadilla didn't have enough cheese which made the edges dry and hard. The El Cholo burrito had hardly any lettuce or tomato and the shredded beef inside of it was very salty. The guacamole appeared to have been made with cottage cheese which I really did not enjoy. As regular customers of the local \"-erto's\" chains, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, could a burrito joint in Ahwatukee be that good? YES. The salsa is fresh and everything I've ordered from the menu has been fingerlicking good! I've recently discovered the green chili burrito and it has been my favorite item thus far! Each item comes with a serving chips regardless if you dine in or take it to go. During the holidays, I was able to order a half dozen of frozen tamales which you can just pop in the microwave or steam in a pot. They tasted almost as good as my mother in laws!!"}
{"text":"Not goood, number 40 isnt as good as the people here says. The fish isnt fresh either. Will not go to this place ever. Number 40 was dry. Number 38 was not as juicy as they say. Not going to try again-_-"}
{"text":"What a load of poop!  could not find the meat in my burrito, your better off going to a real Mexican restaurant. I have nothing else to say but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live within a few blocks from here over ten years ago. We are here ALL the time. After moving to Chandler when we are in the area- WE STOP IN! This place is consistently phenomenal and we miss eating here once a week like the old days. I'm glad to see their relocation and thankful that the food had not changed."}
{"text":"Burritos are great.  Taco tuesday is a household ritual.  I've been eating here since I was a kid, and I always come back.  That should say something."}
{"text":"love their salsa!

love their tortillas!

love that it's both local and family owned!

love the great prices!

and, i love the new location!

overall, yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this business family owned and operated. Love the new digs..although I did like the old place just as well. We get the LA POCHA enough for two...but I don't share : ) You can ask for the whole wheat tortilla to make you think your making a healthier option....but well worth every bite."}
{"text":"Very slow.  You have to be willing to spend sometime to get your burrito and when I got home my order was wrong.  Don't ask for salsa to-go without expecting to pay for it.  Make sure to have sometime to spend if you intended to eat at the place as well.  I would go to Los Taquitos down the street, much better service and timely food."}
{"text":"Food was marginal. I had a chicken taco plate and burrito that was flavorful and could have been worth the very long wait if their wasn't better available nearby. Nothing special here folks. Glad we didnt move to Ahwatukee for the food."}
{"text":"Oh yeah.. best little mexican place in these parts.  Breakfast burrito's ROCK!!

Very friendly staff, seems like family owned because I always see the same two ladies working.  

Their salsa is so good too, and you get a little salsa bar to play in too.  And they've got the best horchata I've ever tasted, but I'm a white guy so why listen to me... go try it yourself :)

Hard to see also but they have a back patio that could be good for small to medium sized groups.

Fail comes in when I want food on Sunday... no dice, closed on sundays..."}
{"text":"Solid all around - I've had their carne asada smothered burrito as well as their tacos and breakfast burrito... all were authentic and tasty.  The service was good and so were the chips and salsa.  I don't have anything super clever or original to say about this joint, most of the time if I'm in the area I hit up Los Taquitos.  That said, this is a solid option and nothing I tasted wasn't good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and we finally did 2 weeks ago (and again yesterday). Great Mexican food!!!! Friendly family atmosphere, clean, fast, great prices, and delicious! First time I ordered a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w/side or rice. Homemade corn taco shells were great! Very hearty taco. Beef was flavorful and juicy. The enchilada w/green sauce had a nice bite to it. Loved the garnishing on top - paired well together. Authentic rice! I love Spanish rice and this was legit! My husband loved his macahca burrito! 2nd visit I ordered the taco salad. It was GIANT and hearty! Delicious, flavorful shredded chicken with perfect toppings. Their guacamole is great! Horchatas are good too! Nice kids menu options. Definitely our New Mexican food go to eatery. The staff was very friendly and welcoming on both visits. And they do Taco Tuesdays for .99!"}
{"text":"The food is great!!! Love their green chile and breakfast burritos.  Large portions you get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"How is this the first time I've tried this place in the 10+ years that I have lived in Ahwatukee? SO GOOD!! Best breakfast burrito I have ever had, by a long shot. Their green salsa is pretty amazing too. The lady up front was so cute and witty and definitely made the experience complete.  Can't wait to come back again :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was sub par. Everyone was busy but I think they forgot their smiles at home"}
{"text":"This was my first time to The Burrito Company and it was pretty good. It is exactly what you expect it to be. A large restaurant that specializes in different burritos. They serve breakfast all day so I had the sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. I took the liberty of adding potatoes, tomatoes, and guacamole to it to dress it up. It was pretty delicious. My only issue is there wasn't as much meat in the burritos as I thought there should be. Other than that it was delicious. Bring your appetite because they are huge."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are outstanding and their iced tea is the best I've had! The place is always clean and the service is fast, even during the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"Mention The Burrito Co. to anyone who is from or lives in Ahwatukee and they know exactly what you are referring to. Now that's name recognition. 

Centrally situated between Tempe and the beginning of Ahwatukee, B-Co, as I like to call it, is a stone throw from the Elliot exit on I-10. 

I'm very accustomed to eating at Amados, so I'm very much an enthusiast of the cheap burrito. B-Co knows how to make a good burrito and charge just a hair more than the Mexican all-night quick stops like Amados.

It's justifiable though considering you can eat on their private outdoor patio or inside where one has the luxury of a television and staff is okay if you change the channel to what you want to see. There are even customer bathrooms outside. 

The downside to B-Co is the hours of the restaurant. It does not open on Sundays and if you plan on grabbing a late night snack after the club, the restaurant will be closed.

The Burrito Co. is also pretty skimpy on the amount of chips it gives out, which are by the way never greasy. Meals also take longer to cook than at Amados so you find yourself waiting around with your little number slip in hand moving strategically around the seating area trying not to get in people's way as they navigate the salsa bar or the fountain drink machine. 

Still, service always seems to be friendly and having a punch card means that your hundredth or so burrito is free. And free is good, even in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Carne Asada by far the best thing in the menu and the people are always so kind. I myself love this place and would love to go back"}
{"text":"They \"ran out\" of .99 cent street tacos on Taco Tuesday...by 7pm. Makes me think the sign is more of a luring gimmick since they definitely still had all the meats...and tortillas....but at 2.99 a taco. If it were true they ran out of mini tortillas they could have just filled their regular smaller ones with less meat."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on the hunt for the best breakfast burrito in Phoenix.  Well the #12 at the Burrito Co comes close.  We always call in our order for 2 #12's on our way home from the dog park.  The burritos are consistently delicious and there salsa is out of this world."}
{"text":"Now that I tried this place again I will not go back. The older women who was at the front was really rude. I got a chorizo egg and cheese burrito and I could make a better burrito at home. Not impressed. Not that good. I agree with other reviewer. Los Taquitos is way better and just a block down."}
{"text":"you can catch me there every tuesday! $1 tacos and the tomato based salsa is amazing and there guacamole with the crumble cheese is great. but they break the Mexican spot law by charging for chips and that really grinds my gears lol 75c for 10 15 chips is crazy! come on now free chips for everyone who makes an order not pick and choose what does come with free chips!! but i still pay cause that salsa is like crack for me!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The breakfast burrito is just what I need in the morning.  Call your order in and pick it up on the way to work or home.  The folks here are so nice, the food yummy and plentiful and the patio an added bonus."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  M brought be here for bfast one morning after he had his O experience with their humongous burritos.  I ordered the chorizo, potato, egg burrito and added cheese.  You can ask for a whole wheat tortilla as well.  M had the bacon, egg, cheese burrito and they chopped up the bacon, not like some places that use 2 long flimsy half cooked bacon strips in their burritos.  Plus our burritos were under $4 each!
You order at the counter in the front and listen for your number.  The place was simple, self serve drinks/ coffee.  There were enough tables, booths, plus some outdoor seating to accommodate the morning crowd.  
Next time, we will share a burrito."}
{"text":"My review is entirely based upon the breakfast burros.  I haven't tried anything else here yet, but the word on the street is just stick to the breakfast burritos and go to Los Taquitos down the street for your other meals.

Meal:  I always try a new breakfast item when I am here but I think I have cycled through all of them already.  Don't judge me too harshly, this place is right on my way to work!

Taste:  I believe it is a well known scientific principal that no breakfast taco can taste bad.  But that isn't to say that all breakfast burritos are created equally!  The OBC's burros are magnificent creations that make all things in the world right.  10 out of 10.

Value:  The burritos are slightly bigger than what your would expect for the price.  Any bigger, they would be impossible to consume without a knife and fork.  And honestly, who eats burritos with knives and forks?  5 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Maybe I don't put a big enough smile on my face when I walk in but the person who takes my orders always seems to be in a rotten mood.  Sometimes it takes a long time to get my burro and I have lost tracked on how many times people who put their order after me and got theirs before mine came out.  If it happens one or twice, I understand, but almost all the time?  Come on, man!  6 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  Nothing special, that's for sure.  There is really no way to comment on their atmosphere when there really is no atmosphere.  1 out of 5.

Overall:  If you stick to the breakfast burritos, you will be safe.  Going outside of the safe will only lead to a broken heart.  22 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Some coworkers have been hitting up the Original Burrito since our office moved, so I thought I would give it a try.

Went their around 12 and noticed lil bit of a rush, but the line moved fast, so I wasn't worried.

I ordered the carne asada burrito with beans & guacamole, the guacamole was extra, because with the burrito you can choose either or, and I just was in the mood for beans, but also in my mind a carne asada burrito always comes with guacamole or avocado, pico de gallo and the tasty meat, so the chance to throw in beans, that made me happy. Just wondered why they would make you choose between the 2.

The flour tortilla seemed very fresh, the meat was delish, the guacamole, which was more like avocado and Mexican cheese blend was perfect, the beans over powered the burrito, next time I will pass on them, and it was lacking in pico de gallo.

The burrito came with chips & salsa, the chips were great, and the salsa, it was great with flavor but a little runner than what I like. I think I will go back and try something different. 

I enjoy trying new places for lunch, and happy to add another on to my ever growing list."}
{"text":"Good burritos but not always consistant. The cashiers on the weekends are always so sour and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem."}
{"text":"This is their new(er) location in the old KFC freestanding building, next door to their old location that got torn down and replaced with a Walgreens.

Hadn't been here in 10+ years (had a bad experience; sometimes that all it takes for me to avoid a place...even though I pass by EVERY day and see the parking lot full of cars). Really glad I gave them another try because my Chicken Chimi was super-yummy, with melted cheese, a side of sour cream and tomatoes, as well as rice and beans. I also got a side of chips and guacamole. Good stuff. Good prices. Efficient service too (in other words, the cashier spoke English, rang me up (complete with special instructions) very quickly, and the order came out exactly as I intended. Yay!

I'll definitely be back with my Mexican-food-loving-husband soon."}
{"text":"The Best Taco Tuesday hands down and the salsa was incredible will be back. Had the pork and beef tacos where excellent but that salsa when I came back to work I was cheated because I only packed 2 of them I haven't had a salsa that good of of a salsa bar in a long time it reminds me of Garcia's salsa. Defiantly call your tacos in because there is a wait."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place in search of brunch. Breakfast burrito was great and pork green chili was tasty too! Great value!"}
{"text":"So irritated that they are closed today on Mother's Day. No sign on the door, nothing. Just closed. Boo!"}
{"text":"Worst burritos I've ever had, not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito, asked for guacamole, which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?

The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude, the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain."}
{"text":"Let me just save you some time. If you have lived in San Diego and you know what good tacos taste like, forget about this place. If you are really craving Mexican food, unfortunately, this joint is about the only place in a 10-mile radius that is not a national chain (except Los Taquitos, which is much better than this place). Only good thing I can say about it is that the salsa is not bad. And if you are in need of a breakfast burrito, they aren't bad here either. Breakfast burrito is the only thing I would eat here. If you want tacos, though, and you are stuck in the Phoenix area, go to Los Taquitos near Safeway in Ahwatukhee."}
{"text":"the food is decent and fairly cheap. The only complaints I have about it is the place is pretty small and can get crowded, they don't serve liquor (eh, but there is a liquor store next door, so I can eat and then get a beer, but sometimes it's nice to have a margarita with your burro) and not always, but sometimes one particular lady that works there can be kind of rude and can mess up your order. 
Though I do enjoy their food and it's within walking distance of my residence."}
{"text":"This place had great breakfast burritos. They are huge so they are definitely worth the price. I hate that I don't live close to here anymore or else I would go every single day. Delicious food for cheap."}
{"text":"Amazing every time. Homemade EVERYTHING. Inexpensive and quick but wonderful consistent at the same time. This place is my husband's guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I like two kinds of breakfast burritos, depending on which mood i'm in: 1) A burrito loaded with spicy meat, peppers, cheese, potatoes, eggs, everything! Usually doubles as lunch. Usually hurts afterwards. 2) A super breakfast-y eggy, cheesy burrito with a decent yet not overwhelming amount of meat, and a more stomach-friendly amount of spice.

Burrito Company is the latter, and they do that type of burrito well! I like  to order the egg, bacon, and cheese, then add in as much salsa as I'm feeling like. The salsa here is thin but full of flavor, and also cilantro. It will clear your sinuses but not burn your mouth. The chorizo is also yummy, but the orange grease isn't all that appealing. 

Aside from breakfast, the food is good but not authentic. Think Filibertos but not as greasy and no russian-roulette food poisoning games. The Super Nachos are loaded with cheese, salsa, guac, and sour cream and will be appreciated by nacho lovers everywhere. The box it comes in weighs over a pound. The quesadillas are made on the giant tortillas folded over and over. Tasty and almost sure to induce a Mexifood-nap. 

Burrito Company is worth a visit for a breakfast burrito, and is one of the most well-known spots in the area- it is one of the oldest businesses in the strip mall in which it resides. Stop by, support a local business, and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try and chose something different. Much better experience all around. Food very good.  I wanted to eat there again the next day. My only real complaint this time is that the salsa bar is only for dine-in use. You can't take your salsa or peppers with you, and they charge $0.55 for each additional tiny salsa.  I usually go through about 4 or 5 with every burrito."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and everyone is so friendly and the horchata is super good but the food is weak. I can't seem to find anything I like and its always dry. The portion size is good though."}
{"text":"Too bad their food is good because there is one Hispanic lady I don't m ow her name who has horrible customer service and is just plain rude!!! And you only get 2 hot sauces per meal any other place you don't have a limit. Also my husband walked up to the counter and asked for a bag and she said \"what do you need\". How rude and horrible disrespectful! I will never be back and will never recommend this place to anyone.!"}
{"text":"Our family eats here often. It's always good and always fresh.  We love the California burrito and Carne as Ada burrito."}
{"text":"What a cute little place !! It's very casual
And very Delish . There are 2 kinds of salsa, A basic red and basic green. Both were yummy . I had the carne asada burrito which comes with a side of chips . It was huge !! It was filled with meat, guacamole & cheese . Really really tasty . My bf had the carne asada nachos . They looked amazing and he stated they were one of the best he's ever had . You serve yourself and bus your own tables , but everything on the menu is dirt cheap so it's totally worth it . I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Cashier could be a little friendlier. More variety of salsas. Overall the food was tasty.."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos all day long. They are quick, the food is good and tasty. I love the #14, add cheese and sour cream and if you feel fancy, make it enchilada style"}
{"text":"This place is one of those little gems that when you find it, you know you've struck gold. My friend and I found this little shop this past Monday when hunger struck us in the AM and we needed to grab a quick bite. The staff is extremely friendly and the prices are crazy cheap. You can get a breakfast burrito for about $3 and they are huge! They'll even give you free chips, and you can head over to the salsa bar and indulge as much as you want. 

So far I've tried the Sausage, egg, and cheese b-fast burrito (add potato) and the Carnitas burrito, which has provided comfort given the ongoing Chipotle debacle and their nationwide shortage of \"Properly Raised\" pork. Will be back to try more :)"}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good breakfast burritos, this is the place to come to! A lot of burrito places have greasy burritos that make your stomach hate you afterwards but the Original Burrito Co. does a great job at making everything fresh to order with a clean, non-greasy but most importantly, delicious taste! They offer two different types of salsa, a green tomatillo salsa, and a red tomato salsa with cilantro and green onions that has a nice kick to it. Personally, the tomato salsa is my favorite over the green salsa but both are fresh and good! All of their dishes (including burritos) come with a side of chips however their breakfast burritos do not."}
{"text":"LOVE their nachos and chicken rolled tacos! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Gross! Should be ashamed. Chips were stale. Hardly any meat in the tacos and had a chemical taste to it all."}
{"text":"So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking.
Opened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight.
I still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.   Mmm mmm.
And here I wasn't very hungry.
This place is consistently good.  
Fresh salsas.
Green Chile Burritos.
Breakfast Burritos.
Thin, crispy, tortilla chips.
And the staff is courteous,  knowledgeable,  and have been pleasant every time I've been there.
It all keeps me (us) coming back for more."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend.  Needed a quick spot while in Tukee and I was very skeptical.   But to my surprise it was very good.  It has that hole in the wall feel.  Carne Asada plate was very good.  Chips and salsa were both standard and good."}
{"text":"Just another burrito shop. I had heard this place was good and had higher hopes. No special tastes here, standard average Americanized burritos."}
{"text":"A CALIFORNIA BURRITO is not chicken, pico, rice and beans. It is carne asada, french fries, and guacamole. Nevertheless, I ordered a green chili burrito and it was fabulous."}
{"text":"Where I work they have burrito Friday where they make a run here for breakfast so I have eaten many burritos from here... I always go with the #2 Green Chile (New Mexico green chilie with pork) or one of the breakfast burritos they tend to be on the dry side so always get a side of sour cream. It's a lot of food if you eat the whole thing it will be a gut bomb you will be full... I split one for the most part so I can still eat lunch."}
{"text":"B-CO!  This places never fails. Great burritos, great service. Went in today and the manager was there. He bought lunch for my  family and I as a thanks you for coming in. Way to show hospitality and generosity! I will continue to return.

And if you've never been here, get the Barbacoa"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to The Original Burrito Co. and it id not disappoint. I got the #40 which is a burrito with eggs, cilantro, shredded beef (or chicken) and rice. I also added guacamole because well, I love guacamole.

The portion size was huge and it came with a side of chips which I didn't end up eating. My boyfriend also ordered some Carne Asada fries which were nothing special. 

They have a lot of choices which I usually don't like but when it comes to burritos I don't mind. When we went the first time around 12pm there was literally no where to sit, it was jammed packed. Today we went around 1:45pm and not to many people were there."}
{"text":"I had a delicious burrito. It had onions and tomatoes in it tho. dont care for those. but other than that :) yum. I remember it was #36 lol but not its name. california burrito or something. idk"}
{"text":"Yes, its pretty descent Mexican food joint. However, i think recently it changed hands and quality went down. Food IS plentiful but unfortunately not all that exciting. Their Tamales were by far the bestest thing i had there.
All in all, its not bad at all but do not expect anything special.

\"Its alright\"

Eugene"}
{"text":"The BEST burritos I have EVER had!  Fresh tortillas, Mexican Coca Cola and hot HOT salsa! AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum, I love this place! My review is based on their tacos and bean & cheese burritos because that's all we really ever eat. Our food is always hot, fresh and tasty, and the ladies at the counter are always nice and friendly. I personally really like their homemade salsas because they use extra cilantro and green onions. I also like the fact that they don't overdo the salt - unlike other places where you feel like you need to drink a gallon of water after your meal. I didn't realize this place was a staple in the neighborhood, and I only came across it because I got tired of being ripped off for skimpy burritos at Los Taquitos and America's Taco Shop. The interior is nothing special and can use a makeover, but where can you feed a family of 5 for under $30 - HERE! Today we came in for our burrito fix, and everything was great as usual. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Love this place . The tostadas are amazing . Breakfast burritos are huge ! I like their old chips though , these new ones are too thick but besides that I one of my favs."}
{"text":"Decent food for a great price. 

Andrew C. and I dropped into The Original Burrito Co for a rare workday lunch (he works nights so it's almost impossible to enjoy this). 

We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito with the guacamole on the side.

Both the red and the green salsas on the salsa bar to enjoy with your chips while you wait were very flavorful. 

While the carne was cooked to a perfect consistency, it seems whoever is cooking in the back is afraid salt, pepper and other seasonings. Come on, man . . . Don't be escared! 

I found myself dumping additional green salsa onto my half and smothering it with guacamole, which was fresh and delicious. 

Came back a second time for the Pork and New Mexico Green Chile Burrito. 

This was a much better option, that pork was incredibly moist and flavorful. And while the chile had a nice flavor, I wish it were spicier. The kind that comes close to ripping a hole in your tongue, but still possible to enjoy. 

Again, this is a decent option in Ahwatukee for fast-casual Mexican, but there is certainly a better place in the neighborhood for your Carne Asada *insert burritos, tacos, etc.* fix."}
{"text":"The burritos are some of the best around.  We decided to get their taco plate last night and it ws not so great.   They filled the taco shell with mostly mashed potatoes - then just a little meat.   I like potato tacos....but I did not order a potato taco.  I will be back, but I will stick with the burritos!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but this place is nothing special. I'm not sure why so many people love it. For one their salsa is garbage. The green chile sauce isn't even made correctly. It's like it came out of a juicer and what they serve you is the left over stuff in blender. I mean that's not real Mexican salsa. I'm from San Diego and even the worst taco place has better salsa then this place. Also they even have real red salsa.  I gave them 3 stars because the breakfast burrito is pretty good but without good salsa it's no Bueno. If any of you want to try great Mexican food go to Señor Taco their the best by far in AZ. Their originally from San Diego. Big portions and priced reasonably 

So I have given this place another chance and tried their green chile pork burrito and I have to say I give that 4stars. Really good and spicy! Love the spiciness of it. I also tried their red pico de gallo type hot sauce and that's pretty good. Too bad they can't improve their green hot sauce because the red sauce isn't the type you can put on your breakfast burrito or carne asada burrito. At least I wouldn't."}
{"text":"Food here is high quality at affordable prices. Love the burritos and tacos  --- the homemade chips are delicious and the salsa bar is scrumptious stocked with two types of freshly made salsa which is simply AMAZING! So why 3 stars? theres a disconnect between order taker and when order is prepared and twice my order has been wrong. Also, they seem not to care about ways to be relevant. when I want there for national taco day expecting there to be a taco discount/specials, there was none. The manager, who is taking my order, said she didn't even know it was national taco day and was laughing about it. totally not funny when I could've gone to Cafe Rio or another mom-and-pop taco place. Also, if you want to order your food ahead of time you can only call it in. They are not associated with Uber eats or any of these types of apps. Also although there is a physical drive-through attached to the building, the drive-through has been converted to a patio so you have to get out of your car. Needs work on modernizing and customer service for sure. I just checked my receipt and realized they charge me for lettuce and cheese I did not get. Again customer service and accuracy of order is paramount. now downgrading to two stars."}
{"text":"For gods sake....I've tried to ignore their HORRIBLE customer service for almost a year now. I just can't do it....seriously, even when they're not busy they're miserable and have trouble managing a simple conversation or order. Will not be back and from the look of those waiting for their food, I'm sure I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place ALL the time in high school. I would go there for lunch almost every other day, and grab burritos for myself and friends (about 20 burritos LOL). Back then it was great, and it was consistent. The thing that drove me nuts about this place was the salsa. Very cilantro-ish and it did a great job on your nasal cavity.

Carne asada fries, egg potato cheese burrito, barbacoa burrito, and the carne asada burrito are all very good. My all-time favorite is the $18, eggs potato cheese. VERY GOOD. this is my standard for breakfast burritos everywhere else I go.

The only reason I give this place a 4-star is because recently the salsa has been very inconsistent. One day I went and the salsa was extremely watery and gross. The chips are consistently gross, but what good is that without amazing salsa. They moved like 20 feet, and the new place is much nicer, but the food quality has gone down a bit. Last night my GF and I went close to closing time, and we didn't get very good food. The steak was more like barbacoa, and the potatoes were more like mashed potatoes (we got a steak potato cheese for my GF). Not very appealing.

This place used to be a staple for me, and I wouldn't think twice about going there. But recently, I don't know what has happened. The old lady that works there is very nice, but I just don't know what is going on to what used to be my favorite non-chain mexican food place in phoenix.

*sigh* I hope they find their consistency again. For a place to be 5-stars for me, it HAS to be consistent. Right now, its lacking."}
{"text":"The good was decent but the staff didn't seem very friendly here. They really like to nickel and dime you here for everything it seems like. It was clean at least. They don't really offer anything that would make me want to come back. Go down the street a block to Los Taquitos instead."}
{"text":"Always great. Always consistent. Great friendly people. Not to mention awesome food I will continue to be a regular and introduce my friends to it that haven't gotten the experience the deliciousness"}
{"text":"They have cheap Britos and they're pretty good.  It seems like a it's like a cheap Chipotle but they have a lot more choices."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come here I get shredded beef chimi plate with fresh green chilis and green chili sauce. PERFECT. Even when we get to go it's still hot and crispy. My only compliant is they are stingy on there salsa. They make you pay extra for EVERYTHING. Some of there people are a little cranky too.....but the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"When I first heard original burrito, it made me think that this is where burritos were invented and that all other burritos (and burrito companies) are just straight up posers.

Anyway...

I rolled in and immediately took note that the Marco Polo was like a shredded beef breakfast burrito, so I went with that since eggs, rice, beef, and tortillas are just my thang.

Pros: Large burrito, eggs were cooked quite well, fair price and value (~$6).

Cons: Nothing exceptional in the quality/flavor department.


All in all, a little bit on the higher said of 3 but not quite a 4.
That being said, I do want to come back during breakfast hours to try a potato/chorizo burrito (yeahhhh buddy)."}
{"text":"Was excited to go here, but slightly disappointed. I ordered a California Burrito and my chicken was cold. It was just a basic burrito. Nothing special about it. The salsa was really good. I will continue to look for a good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh Burrito Company... no more...  I visited again and this time my experience was down right awful. I picked up a chorizo breakfast burrito to go. Super rude service and they charged me for extra salsas that weren't in the bag. I asked for the burrito to be double wrapped since I live in Maricopa and when I got home it wasn't, the burrito was cold. There was a hair wrapped into my burrito and to top it off I got really bad food poisoning and had to miss several days of work. Thanks burrito company...I won't be back.  I'll be taking my business to Los Taquitos, Rubios, Tortilla Fish, Chipotle or any other good Mexican food locations nearby that don't offer crappy service with a side of food poisoning."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. Really good breakfast burritos and tacos. However today I found a short curly black hair nestled in my machaca burrito and had to throw it away immediately and now I feel ill. This really sucks since I liked this place a lot and its the closest burrito place but now I cannot eat there anymore. I did see someone not wearing a hairnet in the kitchen, please up your health standards."}
{"text":"Amazing number of burrito choices!  I had the green chili burrito (only $3.65!) which was standard chili sauce, with chunks of tender pork.  There wasn't a LOT of meat, but for $3.65, it was a nice value.
I also had their Mexican Chicken Soup, which was fairly unique.. it was very flavorful, and included a generous amount of cheese, and crema fresca..  
My parents had fish, and shrimp tacos.. those tacos are HUGE! heh. 
The staff didn't quite seem to be firing on all 8 cyls, and the dining room needed a serious sweeping/wipe down.  I guess they are in the process of adding a patio, and doing some remodeling, so that may have something to do with it.  Also, I was impressed with their tea selection.. two types of Tazo iced tea! :D Great place for a quick, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"cute little lunch place - pretty quick service for being so busy"}
{"text":"I live near by.

I love me some burritos.  

I love me some carnitas. 

I love me some carnitas burritos. 

I have a healthy fear of carnitas, but not from here.  

Lil' dirty, (not like nasty, but obviously not OCC about shit here), little hokey inside ('cept the bathroom door - art nouveau shit is tiiiiight) - putting my Bob Ross hat on for a min... I'd say a wee bit o' nepotism is prevalent; e.g. someone's neurotic auntie got the nod to hang their interpretation of modern 'Mehican'.  Regardless, I'll be god damned if I'm not here at least once a week.  

Open at the butt crack o' dawn (6:30am)  slinging chorizo and egg 'ritos, delivering scrumtacular nacho-quesadi-lladas at night  (like 5:30pm - 9:00pm...ish).  Set the bong down, and give em' a call.  
 
Repeat after me:  'I'd like the carnitas burrito'

{"text":"We paid close to $45 worth of barely cooked tortilla dough.  That's what we got, mostly a gigantic empty tortilla with a shrivel of what we ordered. The \"burritos\" were pretty much empty inside, more than half was just dough very carefully rolled so that the \"burrito\" would look as if it was full.  The machaca was dry, old,  tasted and had the texture of cardboard.  I will not waste another penny there.  What a shame, they used to be good, I wonder what happened."}
{"text":"I had the Fish Burrito. After paying, I asked them for extra tartar sauce. The young girl at the register said that they do not have tartar sauce. How can you not have tartar sauce with a fish taco or burrito.  I decided to try it anyway. After putting my prejudice away on not having tartar sauce with a fish burrito, I was not pleased with the burrito. I let the girl know about my concern and she brushed it off like I'm crazy. I told her that it's the same thing as having pizza without red sauce. You must have tartar sauce with fish taco or burrito. I give them 2 stars because of the non-existing tartar sauce, the I-don't-care-what-you-think attitude from the cashier, and the lack of fish in the oversized burrito."}
{"text":"I want to be impressed with this place.  I really do.  I will give it one more shot.

I liked the flavor of the green chili, but as with most places there is always too much tortilla and not enough meat or insdies.  Its beans and rice people - fill it up.

The Salsa offerings were okay.  I would have like my tortilla chips when I paid so I could dig in while waiting for my burrito.

I like the decorations, it really fit the type of restaurant.

Burrito Co, if you're reading this - more on the inside will give you less tortilla.  Or you could just rip us off and make the tortillas smaller."}
{"text":"Three stars for food only ! I went last night and had a horrible experience with the woman who took my order.  Sadly I'll go back for the food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ahwatukee Restraunt! It's damn good. 

I've been coming here since I was a kid, and I've never even tried any of their plates! I only ever get a b-fast burro, #12 with guac! Their salsa is fantastic, I could eat it with a spoon!  (and I have...)

Dfinately give this place a try! Mmm!"}
{"text":"We are in town visiting and we decided to try this place and it was so good. Great flavor! Good burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. 

This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.

I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest."}
{"text":"Heard such great reviews and was so excited to try their breakfast burritos this morning. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The burritos tasted more like egg than anything else. I couldn't even taste cheese that was supposed to be in there. It was just so bland and lacking that special flavor I was expecting. The green salsa was also blah. I was just not impressed with my entire order. Not as good as all the great reviews I have read and heard. I'll give it one more try to see if I just picked bad items on the menu but that's it! Grrrrrr!!"}
{"text":"Chorizo, egg, and potato with cheese and sour cream... every time. I have a gluten intolerance, so they make mine and give me corn tortillas. Excellent prices, always consistently good, and HUGE portions. Ladies can be a bit grumpy at times, like us all...."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this high quality quick service mexican restaurant.  We placed a to-go order for Barbacoa Plate and California Burrito with Carnitas.  Overall, a great dinner!!  Interaction with employees was good.  Took us a while to get there, but will definitely be back to order more."}
{"text":"As Mayor on @foursquare, I'm obligated to review this place. Favorite is the Veggie Mixto burrito. I add pico and green salsa and salt to the inside though, as I think they're salsas are bland."}
{"text":"Their service has gotten so bad. Food is good, but not worth going for the terrible treatment. They've lost my service for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of our family favorites for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We usually stick to the breakfast menu, which by the way is REAL food!!!  Not like fake, drive-thru egg burrito things!  We have tried EVERY breakfast burrito and other items off of the Menu, all of them have been Tasty!!  They are usually very fast, however, sometimes if you Call It In,  the wait can be long because they ARE very popular.  Easy to find in the EOS parking lot next to Walgreens with plenty of parking.  Portions are FANTASTIC for a GREAT PRICE!!!  Staff is mostly friendly, and more friendly the more they recognize you.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  When you have out of town guests over the Holidays, consider ordering breakfast and bringing it home!  Fairly priced, big portions, lots of flavor, easy clean up!  Mom says YES!!!
PS I really LIKE their salsa:)"}
{"text":"This place nickle and dimes you $19 for two burritos and a side of chips....really? They charged us 35 cents per salsa when we said to go yet people dining in are dumping it on their plates...really salsa? Come on. Asked for guac on the side when it came on the burrito and they just didn't give any... Beware they are looking to save $ any way they can come on really? I support small business but come on guys. Treat us right and we would come back...not anymore"}
{"text":"The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa."}
{"text":"I am very passionate about this place. I've been coming here since I was in grade school. The #19 Bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito is by far my favorite. Great salsa and chips too. You won't regret eating The Original Burrito Co."}
{"text":"Moved out to Arizona about 11 years ago and this is still a favorite for our family. I drive out from Maricopa City just to get the carne avocado burrito. Love their breakfast burrito's as well."}
{"text":"Seriously this is possibly the worst breakfast burrito I have ever had! I ordered a breakfast burrito to go and when I asked for extra hot sauce I got a huge attitude but, that aside I was excited to try it out. It looked like it would be pretty authentic . I came in and cut it in half only to discover mashed potatoes drenched in butter, the egg didn't look like egg and the salsa was horrible. Maybe that's not there specialty but, I'm not going to go back. I had to toss my burrito!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada Burrito was yummy. We also got some Rolled Beef Tacos as well. Food and service was good, the woman behind the counter was very courteous. The Salsa was just so-so. The Salsa Verde was very runny and not much kick. The Red Salsa was mild at best, with no option for Hot (only one flavor). They had lots of Jalapenos present, but that is a given. The new location seems to do much better for them."}
{"text":"Burrito Heaven. I'm really getting behind on my Yelping, but I had to at least get to my review for the Original Burrito Company.

When I looked them up here on Yelp and saw slightly under four stars I was taken aback. Who could give a low rating to this place? Even if the Soup Nazi was the owner, the quality and quantity for the money should put it over four stars. I NEVER go to the same restaurant twice in two days, but yesterday and the day before I stopped here--the second day because I was just curious about the other stuff on their menu. I should mention I live about ten miles from here. 

It started on Monday when I was bringing my son back from the doctor near Ahwatukee. It occurred to me as we left that I had lived in Ahwatukee twice before (I'm now in Tempe) and never tried the Original Burrito Company. I decided to rectify the situation.

I don't think this place is ever slow, but I caught them at a good time. There was no one in line in front of me, though the counter person was doing other stuff and took a couple of minutes to greet me--more on this later. I opted for the carne asada burrito. It arrived in a few minutes and it was AWESOME! When I think burritos I typically think FLATULENCE because 9 times out of 10 they are 50% beans at the very least. Here, with this particular burrito, they give you an option of either beans or guacamole. I went for guacamole and it came out to about 85% carne asada (yummy), 10% guacamole (good), and 5% salsa verde (excellent and spicy). This was $4.50 including chips. 

The next day my wife and I stopped by. I had the red chili burrito and my wife had the pollo con chili rojo y arroz. Mine was $3.65 and hers was $4.45, including chips, and both were awesome. Again, both were stuffed with the main ingredients and not a bunch of beans and other fillers. Somebody here mentioned that they are skimpy on the ingredients, but I have found the exact opposite to be true on my two visits. Maybe when that reviewer visited they were training a new employee. 

The only drawback that I can find is the service. It is not bad, but not super friendly or real attentive. No one greeted me when I walked in and both times it took the woman behind the counter a couple of minutes to say anything to me. But once she started taking my order all was well. 

For anyone wanting no-frills Mexican--burritos in particular--this place is Heaven."}
{"text":"The most unimpressive version of Mexican food this side of Mexico.  Chipotle knocks it out of the park better than these guys.  Nothing they make is even worth mentioning...and they have a menu that's quite extensive.  I did like their fork dispenser system which ended up being the saving grace.  OBC is like a one night stand in which you sneak out of the place, disgusted that you had a sample of the product.  In either case you never come back."}
{"text":"You'd think it's hard to go wrong with a burro. Well, I've had my fair share of bad ones. But the chili rojo I got at the Original Burrito Co. was done right! Pork, rather than beef! Lots of it! Lots of the spicy sauce! Deliciousness abounds!

Also, take a note from me and be sure to read before doing.

Clearly, I don't pay attention as much as I should, but....

...When I see a bar of salsa, my first instinct is to run...toward it. Then of course I realize that there are only paper cups without lids to put said salsas and pico in. When you've got an order to-go, this could be tricky. Then you might notice the sign that says that salsa comes prepackaged with your to-go meal. I am such a ditz sometimes.

Anyway, after a few mix-ups, and me being a nervous and easily embarrassed person, we finally got home with the goods. And like I already said, everything was pretty solid. The salsa was nice and spicy with good flavor, although I thought the tomatoes in the pico were a little mushy. The tostadas looked pretty nice, too.

The menu was also pretty expansive, and I'm sure any of their burritos, platters, or tacos are excellent."}
{"text":"Love the local feel of this place. Their green enchilada sauce is outstanding. I try to come here as often as a I can when I'm in Ahwatukee. I always get their #2 Green Chile burrito... Consistently amazing."}
{"text":"The Burrito Company is casual, authentic mexican food with top-notch flavor in a hole-in-the-wall environment.  

The carne asada is amazing - try the California Burrito with Carne Asada.  Flavorful meat, spicy pico, refried beans and rice wrapped into a fresh flour tortilla.  Another favorite is the chicken chimi with chicken that tastes like it's been stewing in spices and vegetables all day it's a wonderful dish.  Its basic, but vibrant, flavors are complemented by the sour cream and salsa that comes with it.
All dishes come with fresh tortilla chips and salsa is help yourself at the salsa bar.

The Burrito Co. also has great breakfast burritos from egg, cheese and potato to chorizo - they have everything you could want."}
{"text":"I just tried something different for the first time in years (and this was the first time I have been there in probably a year as well)... 

The machaca was so dry and stringy that if you didn't know better you would assume it wasn't even food. The burrito was actually impossible to eat and I really want to like this place. I'll leave at 2 stars because I want to believe they'll be good again one day but as of now I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a chicken soft taco for lunch and a taco salad for dinner, taco salad was still very good when I brought itoout to eat. Great job."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this burrito Co for years. If you like breakfast burritos, they have the best. I've never liked their guac but I would recommend pretty much every burrito on their menu. My favorite was always the California burrito with beef, rice, sour cream and cheese. It's not on the menu anymore but they'll still make it if I ask;)"}
{"text":"Original burrito company is the bomb!!!!! Love it. Amazing food. Amazing people. Salsa rocks! Burritos are amazing. Mmmmmmm good."}
{"text":"This is not the place for me. I would probably give them one star but I did have a soup here I liked. My gf likes the place. For me the food just wasn't good. I didn't like it."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Call ahead so you can walk in and pick it up. Green chili pork is good. 
Casual fast food type of place. Seating isn't comfortable, they do have a patio."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced but my carne asada burrito was a little tough. Also my husband's machaca chimichanga had way too much egg vs. meat. I will probably still come back, but order something else next time."}
{"text":"Had a machaca burrito. Tasted like pot roast, the meat was dry and chewey. Salsa was nothing special. I guess they are known for the breakfast burritos so I might give em one more shot, but I say go right down the street to Los taquitos. Never been dissapointed there."}
{"text":"Love their tortillas. All around great Sonoran style eatery.  Best in this part of town.  Just wish they served cervazas!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 20 years.  The best green chile burrito I've ever had!   Their breakfast burritos are very good as well.  My only knocks  are the extra charge for to-go salsa (it's really good salsa though) and occasional slow service.  Other than the charge for extra to-go salsa,  prices here are great."}
{"text":"Go in with an empty stomach , the burritos are huge. The price is very reasonable. Salsa is good, friendly service, and pretty fast service."}
{"text":"I used to stop here for breakfast burritos on my way to work all the time (the #12 veggie), but now that I'm laid off, no more burritos for me.  I've had most things on their menu, the fish burritos are really good if you eat them right away while the fish is still crisp and as for everything else, it's all good, but my heart belongs to Filibertos.  I like everything here, but I like it better at Filibertos.  Since there isn't one around and if you're near the Original Burrito Company, stop here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid. Came here Sunday morning for breakfast. Burritos are around $4 for a nice large burrito filled with yummy goodness. Both me and my dining companion got #14... which is egg, chorizo, and potato burrito. I ate about half of it and was full... I saved the other half for later which was a delicious treat. It is not really in a location I go to regular but if I am in the area and craving delcious burritos I know where to go!"}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with the flavor.
Service was good but food wasn't really. Not saying it was waist of money but didn't worth the money I spend.
I could have better.
Anyway not going back again."}
{"text":"I think the definition of two stars sums it up perfectly - \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Everything we ordered was decent and edible but nothing was fantastic, nothing stood out, nothing will bring me back here when I know there are better options around."}
{"text":"Gave it 2 stairs because the food is really good. The one thing that could be better is the service. The ladies are very rude and don't seem to like there job. They should quit or be fired. Not very welcoming"}
{"text":"We were in the area to get our car fixed and as soon as my husband saw burrito in the name we had to stop in. The tortillas reminded us of the homemade tortillas his Nana makes. They were really good. The green salsa was my favorite but the red one was really good too! We definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Come here regularly, spend about $250 annually, but no more as the service (or lack thereof) makes one scratch your head...just for some average Mexican burritos and fare. Why? When you order a custom $8 breakfast burrito don't ask for some chips. If you do, expect a cold stare and a only-if-you-pay smirky remark, and then when one protests, better have your receipt ready to show proof it was a custom order or they'll charge you extra! Really! I had to prove I actually ordered what I ordered for a few, free mediocre chips. My family and I will never be back, nor will we recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"The burritos here are huge! The flour tortillas that they wrap the burritos in are very large and good.
Anything you order is delicious and homemade. 
Many days you will see policeman or fireman meeting up there to enjoy a meal.
The same Mexican family has owned and run this business since it first opened in 1982."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place when I was craving a breakfast burrito. Meh, not that great. Just your basic breakfast burrito, nothing super special. I had to ask for a customized burro and ended up not getting everything I ordered on it. It almost feels like a cafeteria more than a restaurant inside. Casual is kind of an understatement. Felt a little dirty, Plastic tablecloths that smelled of mildew and less than adequate dining furniture. Oh well. It's been there a long time so maybe I am in the minority here!"}
{"text":"I dream about this place sometimes. I've been going to Burrito Co for over a decade and just love it. The salsa is so good, bean & cheese burro's delicious! They also have other great burros, but I am soo down the with this B&C that I hardly stray. 

Prices are pretty decent and the staff is nice. That being said, I am not a huge fan of the new building. It doesn't have the same charm/ambience as the original and I miss it."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, their breakfast burritos are the size of newborn babies and cost less than $6.00! Flavor was good and had none of that greasy stuff to get in the way. The salsa is really good too. I caution you, bring a friend and split the thing or you'll have a lot of burrito for leftovers."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. Tried it three times. Today I had a chicken California burrito. Mushy rice, bland beans, flavorless chicken. The frozen tortilla wasn't warmed up all the way. Chewy and dense. Friendly staff, fast service. The chips are good if you can overlook them being stored in a dirty looking trash can. This place is not for me."}
{"text":"First time trying this place after hearing so many great things about it and it did not disappoint!! I called in my order since I was going in on my lunch and good thing I did. I wanted to just get a plain carne asada burrito with rice but the employee advised that I should get the California burrito with carne asada and boy was that a great recommendation. The burrito was so good and had so much flavor kinda reminded me of a burrito back home (Los Angeles). I'll definitely be going back real soon!!"}
