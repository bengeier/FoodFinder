{"text":"Came here on a Sunday in a blizzard. Nearly shit myself when the drinks came before we even settled in. Ordered 3 $5 steak sandwiches before winning on the VLTs. All the steaks came completely as ordered.. A miracle in itself. Waitress was cute and friendly. I would definitely recommend this bar for food."}
{"text":"After being extremely indecisive on where to go for dinner, a friend advised that she had a coworker who has been to Mr. Schnapps and said it was good, we decided to give it a try. 

We chose to sit in the dining room and after hearing nothing but silence, we should've took that a hint to leave. We were seated by a friendly hostess, however, the restaurant had 2 other tables that were occupied and she sat us directly behind the hostess station. There was no music or anything playing, just silence, so we felt we had to whisper the whole time. Our server came and took our drink order 5ish minutes (again, thoughts of running were discussed while waiting). She brought our drink and didn't return for another 15 minutes for our order. She was maybe 8 feet away from us but was too busy standing and eating her dinner to notice us. When she did return, my friend ordered a chicken sandwich with a side caesar salad and decided on a thin crust wild mushroom pizza. Our food took about 20 minutes which isn't unreasonable, however, we sat with empty drinks for a majority of it. Again, the server was a few feet away from us eating and chatting with the hostess. Another person brought our food out, the pizza looked like a frozen pizza that had been overcooked and the caesar salad was drenched in dressing. We had a little chuckle and a moment of why didn't we run while we had the chance. Our server came and we asked for refills and salt and pepper. She returned with the refills but no salt and pepper. We had to constantly ask for refills which is annoying as literally there was only one other table at this point on the other side of the restaurant. 

The server and hostess were busy sorting money and chatting which it totally fine as long as clients are happy. I said to my friend that the entire time we were there, she hadn't once checked in on the other table in the restaurant.

The bill came and she did separate them for us so that was nice. We felt obligated to leave a higher tip than wanted as we paid with the debit/credit machine at the table. All in all, it was a hilarious night filled with wtf moments and this actually can't be happening moments. 

The food and service was something to be desired. On our way out we noticed that the front door had a height measurement chart so that should've been our first clue! Do yourself a favour and just go to Ihop instead!"}
{"text":"the only reason why i gave a one star because of the service.   the food was horrible.....that is understatement.   the hollandaise sauce was more like butter. the asparagus was overcooked and the steak was so cheap it was mostly fat.  the combination made it completely inedible.  the pizza was extremely greasy and undercooked.   we won't be going back.....ever.   management was a joke.  didnt even bother to come out and face us either then they had the nerve to only discount our bill by 15%......which was told to us by the server.  it wasn't until we bitched that a meal we didn't eat that it was taken off.   the server we had was absolutely fabulous....it was the only thing good thing about this place.   it was cold, in need of modernization and only about half the bulbs over the tables were working.  so in a nutshell......horrible food, mediocre atmosphere but great service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the pork loin special.  2 boneless chops with ample roast potatoes and garlic toast for $10.  A very filling meal and a decent price.  Service was quite good as the restaurant side later in the afternoon was not busy.  I would have rated the place more but a lunch companion did not like their meal."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time the other day. It is showing its age but the food was pretty good. We had calamari and dry ribs, i was pleasantly surprised! Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"We Have been looking for decent pizza since our regular place closed down. Having not eaten from this restaurant in 10 years we decided to give them a try. The pizza was garbage. We ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza, ham and pineapple pizza and hot wings. Firstly  I'm quite sure they are using a cheap prefab previously frozen crust which is never a good idea. The pepperoni  was not pizza pepperoni so it was thick, uncaramelized, greasy and bland and as for mushrooms... we couldn't find any. The cheese was terrible. By far the cheapest, poor quality cheese I have ever seen on any pizza when it cools it has a similar colorization to lard. Secondly the wings... they were more like bones with franks red hot, we decided to see how little meat there really was and managed to pick off and weigh 2oz of meat from 14 wings... pretty laughable. Finally $5 for delivery?? Then your driver expects a tip too... here's a tip don't work for a company that charges so much for delivery."}
{"text":"We used to go here Wednesdays after hockey but due to the poor wait staff moved over to OJ's."}
{"text":"This is one of our families favourite places to go.  It's not to expensive. You leave really full as the portions are great and their Caesar salad dressing is the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Mr. Schnapp's is a goodie but an oldie. For a long time, as a vegetarian, I was really limited as they didn't have much for those on non-meat diets. Now, as a pescetarian I have more options, but I still go for the pizza at Mr. Schnapp's.

Monday night is order-in half-priced pizza. The pizza is phenomenal. I always make my own--pineapples, mushrooms, and green peppers. 

The restaurant itself is very quiet, and a great place to have a leisurely dinner without having anyone prod you to leave.

I've heard good things about their other food from my family, but can't speak to that myself."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there after a weekend to canmore. I ordered a Philly cheese steak special ( 11$) itS a daily special. And my husband ordered the 8$ daily steak sandwich with fries (7oz) there was also a 4,95$ 5oz steak sandwich special with fries . First my Philly cheese steak sandwich was huge... Filled with onions, peppers .., a full, uncut, 7oz steak cooked to my perfection.   Well this sandwich was awesome! I replaced the regular fries for yam fries and they were awesome! The chipotle dipping sauce that comes with the fries is just simply AMAZING. My husband really loved his steak sandwich. The gravy was really tasty ( did not taste like flour) ...and the steak cooked rare was rare just like we asked... Big servings .., really good. Will be back for sure to try everything else on the menu. Oh and I had the French onion soup to start ( a lot of cheese and tasteless croutons) but not bad for 5 $"}
