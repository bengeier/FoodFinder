{"text":"In my opinion, The Cathedral Buffet is the best buffet in Ohio! For decades, it has always been a very big attraction, and longtime lunch/dinner favorite for busloads of area Church Groups. 

The Buffet is owned by the dynamic Television Minister, Rev. Ernest Angley, who raves about it having the best fried chicken and ice cream in the vicinity. 

Additionally, they have the best (seasonal) ham, BBQ Ribs (cooked outside), cakes, cookies, and cupcakes around. 

They also have a large soup and salad bar, coffee (with a original or french vanilla cream machine), a variety of other hot and cold beverages, wheat and white rolls, a variety of tasty vegetables, baked and fried fish, baked chicken, stuffed green peppers, etc. 

Be sure to check out the Gift Shop, and the beautiful \"Life of Christ\" Display on the premises. And if you so desire, you can take a short walk next door and attend a church service in the beautiful, historic Cathedral Church. 

After night church services, the buffet opens for two hours--for a late night dinner (usually around midnight). The price is only $6.00, but the menu doesn't include the entire regular buffet items."}
{"text":"Come for the crazy televangelist memorabilia but do not stay for the food. This more closely resembles prison food than a buffet. This place may be good for people watching but strongly discourage eating the food."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken around. Fish was  good, carving station. Deserts OK, salad bar was pretty good always fresh. Very clean but dated. Workers were very nice and kept things filled. Parking lot is a mess holes everywhere crumbling concrete. I am surprised it was never fixed. Much better than the big chains!"}
{"text":"Love love the cleanliness here!!! Look around. Everything is so clean!! They seem to really take pride in their restaurant. 
The food is delicious and fresh. A lot of the items seem like homemade. 
The people are very friendly and attentive as well. 
No complaints. For the price , the Sunday buffet is a steal. All you can BBQ ribs (homemade) and the potato salad??!? Yummoooooo. Come try for yourself!!"}
{"text":"There was an OK selection of food for dinner and the place is kind of creepy inside. Its creepy because the staff who comes and takes your dishes act like a bunch of zombies because you never hear them talking or anything. They just walk around to other tables and grab the dishes. It was really dark in there and the desserts were not the best. The cupcake I had was terrible and tastes like its been sitting out for a while and the cookies were dry. The only food I really liked was the pasta salad and the chicken. There is also a basement where you can pay to see some Jesus statues which I thought was creepy to have in a restaurant and there is also a gift shop there. Even though the food was not the best, it was very clean inside and I also noticed there were a lot of older people there. I would not recommend this place for someone to go to except when its close to Halloween because its that creepy."}
{"text":"First the plus sides..

It's all you can eat.

The drink is included in the price.

It's a no tipping establishment because it's completely self serve.  The only people you see are bussers who grab plates every now and then. 
It was $58 and some charge total for our family of 5 which is cheaper then we normally get away with in non-fast food places.  


The down side..

The food is \"meh\", and I'm being really generous calling it \"meh\".  It's like institution or bad school food.  I feel like they had a goal to make the food edible but not very good to keep you from eating much so that they could keep costs down. 

 The plastic table clothes are a little bit sticky.I made sure to keep my utensils on a napkin and not directly on the table at any time. 

 I had go back and grab a 2nd spoon because the first one I grabbed had food and lip smears on it.

There are dusty fake flowers and bad religious decorations all around. 


It was ok but I doubt I'll go back.  I'm a fat girl who loves buffets so I'm a little bummed it was that bad."}
{"text":"Sad to learn this place closed. This was one of my favorite places to eat when I was a kid. I live in TX now but would try to go every now and then whenever I came back to visit.  One more thing I enjoyed as a kid I won't get to share with my pen kids now."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Cathedral Buffet yesterday for Easter dinner. We were expecting to have to wait in line for an hour but we actually only waited about 10 minutes. I was so glad we didn't have to wait in line forever! And the line was inside the building the entire time, no waiting out in the sun! There were actually two lines going so it moves quickly. I do suggest though that if you have a difficult time walking, to bring a wheelchair. It's a long walk from your car to the dining table. 

When we walked up, I noticed a couple big signs that said that your entire party must be present before you can get in line. I think this is wonderful! The last thing you need when hundreds of people are trying to get in is trying to accommodate people waiting on other people to show up. I also like that the parking lot is huge and there are plenty of spaces. I had to park pretty far away from the building but I was still in the lot.

When you walk in, you suddenly realize just how large the building is. It's massive! We got in line and along the path, there were several people asking how many people were in our party and wanting to know if our party was all there or if we were waiting on more people. 

We eventually made our way to the register. The price for an adult was $12. I forget how much it is for kids but I think it's reduced. 

Then we were seated and told to help ourselves. There is a large salad bar in the middle of the room. There are also several drink and silverware stations. They had a bunch of different soda options and coffee. There may have been tea as well but I didn't look for it specifically.

We then got in line to get food and as I walked down the line to fill my plate, I quickly realized that this buffet is full of what I like to call \"old people food.\" Now, I don't mean that in a negative way, but when the food is mostly mushy items, that's just how I classify it. 

Here are some of the items on the buffet: rolls & corn muffins, mashed potatoes, gravy (white and brown), mashed sweet potatoes, green beans, corn, cooked carrots, collard greens, rice pilaf, cornbread stuffing, roasted chicken, baked fish, fried chicken, roast beef, ham, and assorted desserts (including sugar free). Most of the food was good. I didn't care for the fish (overcooked) or the cornbread stuffing (I prefer bread stuffing). I had ice cream for dessert which was pretty tasty!

I didn't try any but my nephew (he's 4) loved the fried chicken. He was gnawing on the bare bone and I was like, \"Hey, I'll get you more chicken! Jeeze!!\" He's a character. Anyway, the family really enjoyed the meal. The staff were friendly and took our used plates away promptly. I'm sure we'll be back next year. Of course there are better buffets out there with better quality food but if you have a large family, you really can't beat the price here. Other Easter buffets in the Akron area are about $25/person (based on my extensive research).

If you're wondering the time frame, we were in and out of there in 2 hours. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Wife and I returned here with a church group. There were approximately 30 of us. The large table area was at the most 2/3 full, and I would really estimate closer to 1/2 full. I state the fullness due to the fact, that they had our group packed in like sardines. There were 10 of us seated at tables that would have normally sat 8. Again the furniture still hasn't been updated. It appears that like Rex, Ernest is more interested in the profits than the atmosphere. Our entire group mentioned the rips in the chair seats and backs. I don't think any of us had a chair that didn't have stuffing falling out of the rips. Sad to have a place open to the public and that serves good home style food, to be in such deplorable shape. It's almost like Angley figures since many if not most of his customers are senior citizens, he doesn't need to replace old worn out furniture."}
{"text":"Okay the food is good and all but you need to drink the coffee.  Its from Indonesia and its the best coffee I've ever had in the U.S....possibly the world.  I've had coffee in Colombia and this stuff is as good or better.  I'm not crazy.  I'd come here and pay buffet price just to drink a few cups of the coffee.  Ignore the televangelism and drink up."}
{"text":"This place should be condemned. This is called a Buffet. I would get better food at my school cafeteria. The food looked to be sitting out far too long and was starting to get warm in the right cases and cold in the others. The seats were old and probably  not properly cleaned.  The place probably has not been updated in 30-40 years. It probably has not been cleaned in that long either. I caught one of the managers replacing napkins. They are from GFS not Sysco or another restaurant provider. How much other stuff is from there. I mean I was just totally in shock. Why did I go here you ask? Because I was invited. I would not give this place or its owner my money on my own accord. If I could give this place multiple 1 star ratings just to lower its overall yelp rating I would. The veggies they used were giant veggies, usually used by restaurants for soup. As they are grown giant so they can be cut up. The desserts look slapped together by someone who was putting together a two year old's puzzle. Im sorry I am not a good cook nor baker but at least my desserts would look presentable. Must have high school degree to make dessert here. Guess not. Must have elementary school degree to make dessert here I mean this place is worse, let me repeat worse than Golden Corral and that is saying something. Seriously don't go here. The whole area that surrounds this buffet is in flux right now. Old and poorly kept shopping strips torn down. Piles of dirt that should be a new shopping strip by now waiting to go up. Its kind of like the bad area that is trying to re build itself. You wanna know why that area is struggling its because scams like this are sucking the hard earned cash out of the innocent people in this area. You can buy ...BUY  the same foods at GFS and prepare it yourself for less money."}
{"text":"The Cathedral Buffet in Cuyahoga Falls is one of those places that I should be embarrassed to enjoy so much, but... here we are.. 

I am bummed out that they no longer do the awesome Saturday brunch. My friends and I used to make the trip semi-regularly to stuff ourselves on delicious deep-fried french toast sticks, bacon and fried chicken, all covered in maple syrup, before heading downstairs to check out Jesus feeding the masses with two fishes, painstakingly depicted in one of many life-like dioramas. 

America!

All kidding aside, the food IS really good, and I have to say that the Life of Christ exhibit and the rest of the museum downstairs is well done and fascinating. The employees and volunteers are all extremely kind and friendly as well! It's a winner!"}
{"text":"CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Cuyahoga Falls televangelist Ernest Angley and a buffet he owns in the Akron suburb to pay more than $388,000 in damages and back wages to a group of employees that the U.S. Department of Labor found worked as unpaid volunteers.

U.S. District Judge Benita Pearson wrote that testimony at a trial held in October and November showed that Angley and his managers at Cathedral Buffet encouraged members of his church, Grace Cathedral, to work at the buffet without pay. The for-profit restaurant used volunteers to save money and the volunteers felt pressured to provide free labor, meaning they should have been paid for their work, Benita Pearson wrote."}
