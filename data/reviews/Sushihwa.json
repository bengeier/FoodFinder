{"text":"I ordered take out through their website - food tasted good, like any other sushi place on Bloor! Happy to have them open near my house."}
{"text":"Smallest tako sushi I've ever had. Taste is average but it seems not much love was put into making it.  Don't rely on the menu online because the price has gone up, and the restaurant opened only a few months ago. (Please update your online menu or else I will assume I was ripped off) Very disappointed with spicy tuna roll, which has so much panko crumbs as filler that I could not taste the tuna. Unagi roll has good flavour (maybe because of sweet sauce?) but the portions were too small and roll pieces were unevenly sized, which is a bit weird. Nothing about it makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"This new place was a convenient stop on our walk to Casa Loma.  Although it appears a bit divey from the exterior, the décor is terrific - open & bright with a skylight to add light to the back of this place.  I did like the service.  The food, however, was ... fine.  It was solid - good but not special.  If I lived in the area, it'd be a good place to grab takeout, but not a destination (or date-night) stop."}
{"text":"Update: went back this week, the rice has definitely improved and everything tasted great. Especially the miso soup. They also seem to get a lot of take out orders.   Glad to have a sushi place walking distance from my place! Prices are decent.  We had the sushi platter for two. Honestly, it wasn't the best or worse sushi I've had. They need to improve the rice texture. Their miso soup tasted great. We also got the chicken karage, a bit overpriced for the few pieces of chicken received. I'll be back just because of the location"}
{"text":"Quick service, calm, fun atmosphere, very calm and reasonable prices. I came in for take out, ordered a miso soup while I waited and they brought me tea. Very modern decor too, recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Some delicious sushi. Glad they had different sushi in their menu from other sushi places. Tired of the same recipes, but not this place. Thank you for making my life better!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food. Not stingy on their portions. Bento box deal is phenomenal. They just need to remember to add the calorie count to their menu."}
{"text":"This place is unfortunately really mediocre if not outright bad. Its a shame because the decor is nice but the service and especially the food is sub par. Hope they can find a way to turn it around as the location is great.."}
{"text":"Love this place - I have had a lot of sushi in my time, but the freshness and tastiness of this place is amazing!! Try the crunch roll for something different, and the Bento Boxes are great value!"}
{"text":"I like the food. The sushi is simple.  The combos don't come with salad which is disappointing to see when everywhere else does.   I can't eat a certain type of sushi and usually substitute for something less expensive so I don't get any push-back but here I'm charged more money  for something that costs less money on the a la cart menu which makes no sense to me at all. When asked why that is the response is something akin to \"that's the way it is\".   Just doesn't seem like a place I'd like to return. Like most reviewers say, the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Not much to say here. It's a cute little place and it was raining so we stopped in for a bite. The sushi left a lot to be desired. The tempura was good. I ordered a second order and axed the sushi. Service was a bit slow considering we were two of the three people there, but there was only one waitress so we get it.  Husband had the Spicy chicken and  gave it a 3 on a 1-5 scale. So, adding that into a total including my tempura, a 3 it is. Prices were reasonable so that made me less disappointed over all."}
{"text":"This place only recently opened and it is my understanding it aspires to be an Izakaya restaurant. We went on a Friday night around 5 pm and it was moderately busy.  The main reason for my 2 star review is the service was very slow, not very polite and the food was average. Many of the tables were left uncleared. My wife and I are vegetarians, they had one bento box that mentioned veggie but They neglected to list a price. They had various a la carte options such as avocado, yam and asparagus which we ordered.  We also ordered veggie gyoza dumplings as an appetizer not realizing they came in our bento box. Our server didn't seem to know what was in the food he was serving or at least wasn't volunteering anything. When he brought soup to our table my wife asked whether the soup had benito to which he replied no. I then asked him if it used fish stock to which he said yes. Even though all of the items we ordered were veggie he now asked us if we were vegetarians, when we said yes he ran back to the kitchen which leaf me to wonder if anything on their menu was vegetarian. Curiously our appetizer gyoza, the gyoza in my bento box and the gyoza in my wife's bento box were all cooked to different levels some almost beige others a golden brown. The rolls were ok, average size nothing special. In the half hour we were eating dinner there were screw ups coming out of the kitchen such as a women getting 24 yam rolls (4×6) instead of the 4 she wanted, granted the rolls come in groups of 6 but the server probably should have verified that she wanted 4 ORDERS of yam rolls, that's a lot of yam for 1 person. We never got our tamago rolls and our server never came to check on us. A number of people came in to order take out and all hovered around the cash and things got very busy. People waited for nearly 10 minutes just to order food. I could see people wanting to pay waited for 15 plus minutes before getting frustrated and walking out. I saw people who sat down at a booth and waited a very long time before the server took their order. We saw these developments and our infant son was starting to get restless. I told my server we needed to pay asap because we needed to get home and put our son to bed, he said nothing, no apologies, no explanations. I went to the cash register to pay, but it still took me 5 minutes to pay. A man who had ordered take out walked out as he had been waiting 25 minutes and they still hadn't started his order. If this place hadn't just opened I would have given it 1 star. Here are some tips. Hire some competent servers who have some communication skills, have more than 2 people serving during the dinner rush. If you get slammed and fall behind discourage take out orders or at least inform people it is going to be a really long time and make it up to those inconvenienced by offering them a discount or free dessert. This place currently doesn't have a liquor license. This place was disappointing and given how many sushi and Izakaya places are out there I personally wouldn't go back."}
