{"text":"Food here was awesome. This place has just as much options as your local Staryucks :) and way better quality as well. Ran by a married couple mom and pop shop you can't go wrong! Also Dave Brisket is to DIE for."}
{"text":"I eat here every day some times twice a day. I have not had anything that I don't like. My favs. are the sweet dessert panini and the tuna with artichoke panini. You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"The owners make everything fresh and to order. They are super friendly and even deliver to your office. I've had their iced rolo macchiato (Susan makes it better than her husband lol), a chocolate raspberry shake (delicious! With real chocolate bits), the Old Staple (made with a slice of real cheddar cheese), and a chicken cranberry wrap (delicious but I think a whole cranberry sauce would be better than dried cranberries). Their waffles are also made fresh and sooo fluffy. It's super convient and reasonably priced. I enjoy ordering from them when I don't bring my lunch."}
{"text":"I stopped in there for breakfast today and ordered a capuccino and breakfast sandwich. The coffee wasn't fancy,  but tasted good, as did the sandwich. It was just the breakfast I needed and definitely worth what I paid for it."}
{"text":"A little hard to find hidden in the center of a business park, but definitely worth finding.  Hot, freshly made breakfast sandwich was delicious. Owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"The food and service are great!  I recommend the tuna melt and veggie wrap, although everything is good."}
{"text":"This place is just plain good food with great hospitality. Susan and Dave serve up an awesome panini with lots of homemade goodness. Would definitely come back to try another entree."}
{"text":"Lunch was great! We tried the Cuban and the Reuben sandwiches. Both delicious and worth coming in for."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I've passed by this place a hundred times and, because it is tucked in an office complex suite, never knew it was there. I had the BEST breakfast quesadilla of my life this morning - chock full of goodies, cooked flat so everything stayed in place when I ate it and seasoned perfectly with some excellent salsa on the side. I'll be back to try the rest of that menu soon.  Mom and Pop shop, cooking to your order and friendly. Oh, and there was this great looking guy (Pop?) at the counter -wink, wink."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is super friendly and the food/coffee is great! I have ordered delivery from here multiple times and I am very pleased!"}
{"text":"The name says it all, it's a hideout alright. So I had some trouble finding it but they were so helpful. He came out to the parking lot to help me out. From main entrance of buildings (red tarp) you'll walk through that way, make a left then take the walkway on your right and you'll see it on your left. Or you can park in the back which might be easier. 
Customer service is great! The food is so good too! I got Susan's breakfast quesadilla. Lots of veggies and cheese and eggs too! Now I know why they have 5 stars! 
So go on an adventure and find the hideout cafe."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today.  The food was excellent.  Good portion size for the price.  The staff were extremely friendly and easy to talk to.  They have a very nice dining room too.  The only drawback I can see is that they close at 5.  But if you're looking for a good place for breakfast, lunch or an early dinner,  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been in a couple times and the food and coffee were excellent. The atmosphere is nice and the owners are good people. The Hideaway part of the name is somewhat accurate, but it's definitely worth finding"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service! The owners are fantastic. STRONG coffee! Just like I like it !"}
{"text":"You guys. When I say I had the BEST chicken salad of my life I really mean it. I am so glad I discovered this place. The sandwich was delicious, the potato salad was amazing and I had a chocolate raspberry milkshake that was to die for!!! 
They were super friendly and fast too. Highly highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast on Yelp and happily found this spot. It's tucked away around the back side of the complex, but we found it pretty easily. The food was really good. I had the hashbrown casserole and French toast and my daughter had a breakfast sandwich. We both tried the nitro coffee and it was so good! The owners were both there and very friendly. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had a couple sandwiches and a drink delivered earlier than expected and everything was still perfectly warm and fresh. Excellent food and a friendly driver. Will order again!"}
{"text":"I had the Big Ben sandwich - egg, sausage patty, country gravy, and hash brown on a flaky croissant.  It was great, check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly owners, great service. 
Amazing variety.  Super cute out of the way place."}
{"text":"It's a nice spot for a breakfast bite- the staff was friendly. I had a bagel & cream cheese which was delicious."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the lakeside hideout cafe. The area is very clean and inviting. The owner's magnanimous attitude is displayed in their quality work. They will do their best to cater your meal to your wants. I had the barbecue pulled pork panini, and I'm pretty sure it was the best panini I've ever had. If you're not in the mood for an unforgettable meal they have a very uncommon nitro-infused coffee. This coffee isn't available anywhere (YET!), so skip Starbucks and give it a try! I'm not from the area, but the next time I'm close I will be heading straight in. If I could rate this higher than 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Great little spot. This place makes amazing breakfast sandwiches. First time in was today and I got the \"Big Ben\" which consists of a giant flaky, butter croissant with hash browns, egg, cheese and fried chicken patty with sausage gravy to wash it down. 

This is a little joint known to the employees that work in the building. Judging by the traffic they make a lot of good stuff there. If you live close, give them a try. Better food than what's by metro center and cheaper too. Our sandwiches were around $4 each and were huge! Keep up the great chow guys!"}
{"text":"I had some business to do in the same property around lunch time, so I stopped by to have lunch. I honestly wasn't expecting much and I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a family owned business. The owners, Susan and Dave, are the ones here cooking and serving. They have a very large menu with all kinds of choices like: pizza, tacos, burritos, salads, vegetarian options, soup... they have a nice breakfast menu, icecream treats and even a Nitro infused cold brew! I had a turkey sandwich with tomato basil soup. The rye bread is a high quality dark rye and the soup is amazingly very tasty. If you work around here, this is definitely the place to go!! Plus there is a beautiful lake on the back of the property! Nice to see cafes like this! I definitely prefer to support a local family owned business! Great job!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered delivery for a business meeting and the entire order was a hit.  We ordered a number of sandwiches and a salad.  The food came and was still warm.  The office will definitely be ordering from Lakeside Hideout Cafe again!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer, as they are located in my work's business complex. I highly recommend the hashbrown casserole, which is my \"usual\" dish, as well as the pizza.  Susan and Dave always give superb customer service! Anyone who rates them 1  is obviously looking for a free meal, bc I've never had an issue. There are some things that I'm not a fan of... Tomato bisque and the stuffed French toast. I tried them, but didn't care for them. They were made properly, it's just my personal tastes and at no fault of the owners. I LOVE the Chicken Parmesan soup! Also try Susan's quesadilla! Want to save some $?  Ask them for a punch card. After your tenth purchase, your next one is free! Can't find them? They'll deliver to you. I'm not sure what their radius is though. You'll have to ask."}
{"text":"The only thing better than my food were the personalities of Susan and Dave! Great place to start my day"}
{"text":"If I could give you guys 0 stars I would simply based on the fact that the owner is absolutely in the wrong line of business. Placed an online order via GrubHub and was sent out to be delivered at 11am. 12:10 comes around and heard nothing from the driver. Contacted the cafe and spoke to the owner herself and was completely befound by her reaction to our issue. We informed them that we had not received the order and she said it was on its way and she can't help we need to contact GrubHub. We have no contact number for grub hub driver. She stated that this isn't her problem and hung up on us. Also, about 10 mins later, we find that they cancel the order! This is literally the worst customer service from a restaurant store OWNER I have ever experienced. Please just do yourself a favor and stay away because you might like the food but the customer service is most important."}
{"text":"The tuna artichoke salad sandwich was so bad my sister could t even eat it. When I told the owners they went back and  tasted  their batch and said it was good... It tasted as if the tuna had turned and the tuna had a grey color!!!  They did t even offer a refund for a whole sandwich not even eaten.... I would t be back"}
{"text":"So good!  This is a small little cafe run by 2 awesome people in the Lakeside center building.  You can dine in, pick up, or if you are in the area, they offer to deliver.  I typically order their omelettes, the Mom's Fav, and... gosh, everything off the breakfast menu is good.  

Their coffee is Mmm... a good pick me up for any day.  They also have snacks in case you get the munches while you are working in the office or just the 'emergency food stash'."}
{"text":"Delicious!  First time ordering even though I work right across the street.  Ordered through Yelpeats and got a Little Red Rave breakfast sandwich.  It was absolutely one of, if not THE, best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  Coworker also said the bagel and cream cheese was great. Now I'm scared because this place is so close and I'll be ordering all the time.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I work above the cafe and they are always quick to bring our meals and drinks to us! They are GREAT PEOPLE and their food is above average! Susan's tuna melt is the bomb! She makes it with olives and it is one of the best things on their menu! Their nachos and Reuben panini are so good and breakfast is awesome too.  I can't choose because it's all so good and always above average service! I will without hesitation give Susan and Dave a five star rating. They are my coffee and breve saviors because we don't have good coffee in our office. If you want a breve that is out of this world and just good food with good down to earth folks I will recommend Lakeside any day! Thanks Guys for always having above average food, and great service! You rock"}
{"text":"First time ordering through grub hub the other morning. Breakfast delivery was a godsend!! We ordered a waffle, bagel and a coffee! Delicious coffee. The waffle smelled the house all day! Great food. It got here pretty fast! Genius idea to deliver breakfast!! Some mornings you just need delivery!!"}
{"text":"I HAVE FOUND HEAVEN !!! I am just impressed with every little thing that makes this place so delicious and welcoming. Looking forward to my next visit. Maybe tomorrow ."}
{"text":"Susan and Dave are super friendly. The 10 inch cheese pizza was only seven dollars and came out in less than 20 minutes piping hot. It was so hot I had to wait at least five minutes before eating. They have RC soda which is really hard to fine. The whole meal was only nine dollars well worth it. Will definitely be going back to try their French dip and other foods."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a challenge to find, but well worth it. They have a good selection of breakfast food and pizza. There Coffee is amazing and they have just as many options as the local Starbucks at half the price. They also have nitro brew! I would highly recommend this spot to pick up your daily coffee, or sit in and have a nice breakfast. Also you can take your food and drink to go and sit on the benches outside overlooking the lake. Pretty neat!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through eat24 and food arrived hot and neatly packaged.   food was delicious! London fog coffee was perfect and still piping hot upon delivery. The hashbrown casserole was full of flavor and attractively placed in box(Not messy, like most casseroles).  

Food  arrived a little past estimated time but well  worth the small wait."}
