{"text":"This restaurant has quickly become my favorite place for sushi in Calgary. Friendly staff, excellent service,  and well prepared sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequenting this restaurant since they were Wa's. Staff take service to the next level. Always fast and efficient. The fish is the freshest in the city (or so my husband says, I eat mostly veggie), and often have unique specials. One of the servers noticed that I only ordered vegetarian and made an effort to point out things in the menu. Definitely the best Japanese restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Sushi rice was overcooked, the sashimi I ordered was not fresh despite being told they get it fresh daily. As someone who has eaten sushi for more than 10 years I know what's fresh and good and what isn't. This was not. The California rolls I got oozed mayo and everything fell apart in one big mess. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. Rather than accept responsibility and apologize the manager was horrible about it and asked me if I had any proof from a doctor. I ate food ordered from there and was ill within 30 min, they were clearly at fault.  Stay away from the avocado tempura, it tasted odd and I am willing to bet it's what made me ill."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for sushi and cooked foods. This is definitely one of the better and more authentic sushi restaurants in Calgary. The fish is fresh and always has been on all of my visits. The cooked foods are also well executed. I don't find the prices unreasonable either although the bill does add up quickly if you order a number of dishes.   My favorite lunch box is the mackerel lunch box and it's super filling. You won't leave hungry. For dinner, you'll be lucky if the deluxe chirashi is available because the portion is very generous for the price. I suggest going with the nigiri or rice bowls vs the rolls which I do find on the pricier side.   Service is average but they are happy to meet your needs. The restaurant is small so I would recommend reservations for dinner. They are a kid friendly restaurant for families."}
{"text":"I've been here  twice within a 3 month time frame. The staff seem very warm, friendly and efficient. The menu choices lean more to traditional style Japanese comfort food . Today we got a chirashi and a katsu currydon.  The chirashi  was very flavourful with a wide variety of fish toppings, they season the rice with seaweed  flakes and thin strips of tamago. The curry was plentiful and on point, it's exactly what you would expect if you have ever had curry in Japan. In terms of pricing I would say it is fair, however if your expecting to stuff yourself silly on sushi, you can expect a slightly higher bill as the sushi here is a higher quality which will reflect on the bill. If you are on a budget, I would suggest getting a cooked main and picking out a few of your favourite sushi choices on the side. Another option is to go for lunch, they have an amazing lunch selection for a great deal.  I think this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is what I'm talking about...a restaurant that remembers me and asks \"it was you that wrote the review about the volcano, right?\" I was back in there last night, and they let me know that the sushi chef who is the Volcano Master has passed along the knowledge to the other wonderful chef who is there on his days off. VOLCANO 7 days a week now!! So happy...  Thank you for being awesome Sushi Bistro Anzu!"}
{"text":"Aunthentic Japanese restaurant, chef and server are Japanese, i've been to Japan many times and this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Quality over quantity. Thats not to say that you leave hungry, but very satisfied. Easily, one if the best sushi/japanese cuisine locations in the city. And please try the rice bowls; you'll look at it, think \"Ok, this is kinda a hot mess\", then take a bite and proclaim to your table buddy, \"I'm totally coming back here. You can come if you want.\"  Small location but not squashed at all. And a small semi-private area if you're entertaining out of town friends.  Oh, and if they still have it, try the the black sesame ice cream. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for lunch this week. We had our 4 month old with us & the staff was very kind and friendly. They were busy at lunchtime but the service was fast & attentive. I had the sashimi lunch special; good selection of fresh fish, rice, small salad, pickled vegetables & daily side dish for $14."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this restaurant and decided to try it out. The wild sockeye sashimi was on the frozen side. I wanted to order the deep-fried squid legs but they were out. We weren't blown away. Very quiet atmosphere, needs music. However, service was 5 stars."}
{"text":"#116 With the same location and phone number as the now defunct and famous Wa's Japanese Restaurant, I had to see what happened to my former hangout.  The interior is the same as before except with a new yellow paint job.  Turns out, it is again a sushi restaurant, well bistro type restaurant.   Price and menu are nearly the same.  Six fusion rolls including Lobster Roll (lobster tempura, crab meat, avocado, tobiko mayo, and unagi sauce), Spider Roll (soft shell crab, lettuce cucumber, avocado, mayo, and tobiko).  Some of the roll prices are cheaper such as the California roll, stampede roll, spicy salmon and tuna roll, and spicy tuna hand roll.  Otherwise, really no difference either good or bad.  I have attached a picture of the hours and the house special roll; last call 15 minutes before closing."}
{"text":"I was pretty sad when Wa's closed but I have to say Anzu is a pretty good replacement in the same spot.  They do traditional Japanese cuisine and has specials on fresh fish flown in occasionally.  I find the prices slightly high but they don't cheap out on portions and definitely has the quality to back up for it.  The staff is super friendly and remembers us only after two visits! Their lunch specials are very reasonably priced with great selections - they are definitely becoming one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm partial to the cooked food at Anzu. The tonkatsu was thinly breaded and crispy, hot off the fryer. The chicken teriyaki was different - I like the sauce, which was light and subtle. Not that tacky generic stuff you can get out of a bottle (or on wings at your local pub). The chicken had this puffy, soft batter. While it doesn't sound appetizing, there was something pleasant about the texture (at least for me). I can see other people thinking it's too soggy but I think it might suppose to be soft.  The sushi and sashimi I sampled was fresh. I tried red tuna, salmon, white tuna, snapper and surf clam. The little side dishes were yummy.  Portions at lunch were generous. Price is actually on the low side for Calgary. Service was good. For those who want to be in the know... for every $10 you spend, you get a stamp. After 10 stamps, you get $5 off your meal.  I spied with my beady little eyes lots of unique deep-fried dishes. Take a look at the specials on the board. Also, the tempura here looks really good. Long pieces of shrimp, snow white batter, and again, the price of their tempura is below average in this city."}
{"text":"We went for dinner yesterday and we were able to get a table without a reservation for two.  We ordered some shitake sushi, inari sushi, vegetable sushi roll, spicy salmon roll, okonomiyaki, sansai udon (wild vegetables), chirashi sushi, volcano and veggie gyoza.  The highlights of the meal for me was the vegetarian dishes; the sushi and the udon was very tasty. We would come back just for the vegetarian dishes. The spicy salmon roll was also flavourful and the sashimi in the chirashi sushi was very fresh.  My least favourite dishes of the night was the volcano but its because we're not sauce people and this dish had a lot of sauce. If you love sauce; you will love this dish.  The okonomiyaki was very sauce because it was also drenched in sauce.  The restaurant is cute and reminds me of Wa's. We will be back for the vegetarian items."}
{"text":"My love for Japanese food at this location has been resparked! I had the longest love affair with Wa's in the past, and was very glad that this restaurant served a similar menu.  On a gloomy Thursday, the bright yellow walls were the perfect pick me up for lunch.   I've been on a Japanese binge for the past week and this has by far been the most traditional, cute and best value so far.  The service here is quick and efficient. We easily did lunch under an hour here today. I loved their special lunch sets, as they give a variety of items to choose from. They even have grilled mackerel as part of their lunch sets (which is very rare).    As we waited for our meals, I took some time to appreciate the little details here. Their chopsticks are covered with the cutest little vegetable printed sleeves, and I could see the care the sushi chef put into assembling our sushi, it almost appeared like he was looking at the sushi with love.   We opted for their Set E: Mini Chirashi + Tanuki Udon ($13.95), Spicy Salmon Outside Roll ($6), and Set A: Tempura + Sushi + Chicken ($13.95).  Portion sizes were more than we expected. Both the sets were presented on the cutest plates and platters. Portion sizes were great for lunch, nothing that would throw you into a food coma when you get back to work. Everything tasted so fresh, using soy sauce would have ruined the purity of it all.  Great value compared to other restaurants I've been to this week, as I have paid more for just a bowl of noodles that weren't even as good as the one I've had here.   If any one wants to take me out to eat, you know where to take me!"}
{"text":"Came here at lunch on a whim and will definitely be back. Small but nice atmosphere, good service from the staff, and it's Japanese staffed.  Had the Gyoza and the Chicken Katsu Curry, both were excellent. Too many places don't get a good crispy skin on one side of the Gyoza, but here is was perfect. The katsu was clearly made fresh and not pre-processed and frozen, and the curry was very tasty.  My lunchmate had several pieces of sashimi and was quite happy with the freshness and quality. We'll both be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food with friendly service. The place has decent, fresh sushi and rolls - but the best are on their specials and cooked food. The ramen had just right flavour in well-developed pork broth. I hate those uncontrollably salty ramen places. Deep fries and other appetizers will never fail. Little hidden gem!"}
