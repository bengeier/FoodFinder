{"text":"Location: North Shore, in the oldest part of St. Eustache. The street itself is a cool little strip, with historic homes that have been around since Charles Auguste Maximilien Globensky oversaw the land (he was the seigneur + Mayor). You can visit the beautiful house he lived in - it's still standing!

Service: No complaints here - we got there around Noon and didn't have to wait for a table. Our wait staff was quick and friendly. 

Food: The first thing I'm going to praise is the potatoes. Hot damn, they're good. There's nothing particularly complex about them - but they offer up the exact level of flavor I'm looking for in the morning. Yumm-O. I ordered a veggie omelet, which came with the infamous patates, fresh fruit, toast and coffee. They delivered up a sizable portion that I had difficulty finishing; in fact, it kept me satisfied until around 7pm when I realized I should probably get myself some dinner. Overall, the food is very good - they menu us quite varied and you can order up a basic breakfast, some healthier options, some waffles - take your pick. This isn't a gourmet restaurant so don't expect anything fancy. They serve breakfast the way it's meant to be served. The coffee is so/so.

Price: Very, very reasonable. You can eat fur under $10 if you get the early bird special (not sure they offer this on weekends). My breakfast cost me $13 tax in, and I had ordered a side of sausage to go with it. 

Stuff: The restaurant itself is very clean and bright (I love me some natural light), and tables aren't stacked on top of each other so you don't have to get to know your neighbour while you eat!"}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast food.  Had the crepes with bananas and chocolate drizzle. I am a big eater. I couldn't finish it. Fast. Friendly. French speaking staff but friendly to us English speaking Americans.  Definitely the place to go in this area."}

{"text":"Went there on a sunday morning with my family.

The restaurant is located in a nice neighbourhood. 

We all ordered classic breakfast plates: eggs with bacon or sausage or ham. We all loved the food!! It's tasty and their plates are huge,i couldn't finish mine.

Our waitress was very sweet. She was kind and her service was perfect. 

Definetly recommend this place, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Large portions. Extensive menu. Only negative thing I have to say is they don't have English menus. Our waitress helped us through the menu. Food was good."}
