{"text":"Amazing restaurant with extra amazing food. Service was fast and efficient! The best thing on earth is the butter chicken; a MUST try! I live in mississauga and came all the way to from there just from a friend's recommendation and it is actually worth going. The reason why i gave a 4 is because once we went there for fish but they sadly said its not marinated and suggested us to order something else. Its always worth going! :)"}
{"text":"I get my naan and eat here frequently.  The lady at the counter is nice and even though the ambiance isn't the best, they make good food. Ate halwa puri 2-3 times with my family and it was pretty decent.  But the naan they make is what seperates them from other restaurants.  The naan they make is big and fresh. It smells so good and two naans are good for 2 people's meals."}
{"text":"We've tried their halwa poori special on Saturday mornings numerous times and it's just finger licking good comes with 2 HUGE puris, some aaloo ki bhujia and some sooji ka halwa ! There's a little bit of pickle also on the side ! Do try it and I'm sure you won't be disappointed :) just remember to come early morning on Saturday or Sunday like around 9 am otherwise it'll take too long for your food because as is their service time is way too slow ....but it is worth it when you taste that heavenly puri and aloo enjoy"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this take out joint for a year now. For anyone who is looking for  authentic  chicken biryani, this is the place to be. The quantity of the biryani is really good considering that you're only paying 7 odd dollars for it. Their kebab/tikka  rolls are good as well."}
{"text":"I mean.... I don't understand why they are charging you so much considering it is a take out place that is so filthy. Haleem $10.50 same goes for Paaya and other curry items. Are you effing kidding me???? Don't tell me you are superior than Shaheen Tikka and Kabab House or Tandoori Times. Both do not have sky rocking prices like you guys."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for lunch with my husband.  We both ordered butter chicken, rice and another chicken dish.  We also had 2 peices of naan bread.  Our food came to 43.00.  I asked the person working there why the price was so high and he then  began arguing.  Needless to say I will NEVER go there again!!!!! The order took 15 minutes.  Considering it's a buffet style restaurant it shouldn't take so long.  I asked if there were peanuts in the sauces and he acted like he didn't understand english.  He clearly does because when I asked him about the cost of the food he spoke perfect english.I have a severe peanut allergy.  The place is dirty and I feel the person ripped me off because he saw that my husband had a 50 dollar bill.  Dirty and dishonest people!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is no sit down restaurant. It's a take out restaurant if you are craving for Indian food. The masala in the food is not as per the Indian spice levels but this is a popular joint if you are coming in there to watch a movie at the Albion cinema and want to get a bite. The prices are reasonable. I tried the Chicken Roll which was not like a Kathi roll but a naan wrapped in chicken. The Biryani is okay but not that great. Don't go there with a lot of expectations and you will be good!"}
