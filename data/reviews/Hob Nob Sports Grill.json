{"text":"It seems to me that this place could be more user friendly, buy some new TVs and spend some money on the large projector side, most of the booths aren't for watching a game, which is why we come here. Foods OK for a bar."}
{"text":"There was an issue with sending the sound in the right places but the owner rectified that very quickly.  Gotta love a place that has 3 sounds zones to accommodate all their guests and gets it done in a timely fashion.  Food was good and no issues with service!  Def will be back!"}
{"text":"I reserved a table for a special sports event, was told that I would have a table set aside for me on that day.  When I showed up the bar was packed as expected, I told the server that I had a reservation.  She went to check for my table and the owner gave my table to someone else.  I was offered another table that was supposed clear out soon and I stood waiting for more than an hour before anyone offered me a drink or further assistance.  I told the owner that I would not be back and that I would tell everyone I know how horrible my experience was at their establishment."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar with good happy hour. Wings and loaded fries are good and staff is welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from Hob Nob so I come here quite often. Since day one, I knew I would be coming back.  The girls on staff are all incredibly friendly and will come and check on you before you realize you're almost out of beer. The owners, Andy & John, are the most hardworking guys you will ever meet in this business. Not only do they make sure every single aspect of your visit is great, but they also will bus tables, fill orders, and make sure you always have a full drink on your table.  The other patrons are all incredibly nice as well. Never once have I seen a bar fight go down here. Everyone gets to know each other and after awhile, they all seem to feel like family.  I would recommend this place to anyone. Great atmosphere and super diverse. Hob Nob may scream for Chicago, but all sports fans will be welcomed and treated with respect."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall joint. Lacking in ambiance, tv are alright. My beer was not cold at all, almost lukewarm. I ordered a burger and fries and it was just alright, typical bar food. Hubby got a club sandwich. Again, just alright. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Went there the other afternoon, like that it is a Chicago bar. Moved from Chicago almost 5 years ago. The service was fast and friendly, a lil nice dive bar we have been looking for! We will be back."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had at any sports grill. We sat down & waited for a server to take our drink order, after receiving our drinks , I looked around for our server to ask for menus. We waited...and waited. No server. So I went myself to get a menu. We finally placed our order, a cheeseburger medium and a steak & shrimp, medium. I received my burger very very heavily well done with a measly serving of fries, I mean you should have seen the table next to me, fries were falling off their plates! My boyfriend ordered the steak & shrimp and his steak was just as burnt. We sat & waited for our server who seemed to have disappeared again, in the mean time I went to the bar myself to get refills on our drinks because I had lost hope in ever getting our drinks in a timely matter. The server never came back around and my boyfriend ended up eating his steak with no sauce and no silverware. I was so upset with the service I barely touched my cold, burnt food. I was very disappointed with the service. I would have asked for a manager but we probably would have waited another hour to speak to someone again. Not even worth a star but I can't seem to post my review without selecting at least one star."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst bar I have ever visited. .  I went there because I saw a great review on the news during world series.  The bartender was a bitch.. (check your phone much)... and the owner seems to like the people who frequently visit; instead of new customers.   I realize those drunks make him money.  But that owner needs to rethink his business plan.  Bar was filled with drunks...not somewhere I would ever go  again.  Sad old people... dark dungy and happy I had no food... could only imagine what the kitchen looked like.  I won't even give it one star yelp made me."}
{"text":"Staying at a nearby hotel during an annual drive across-country for Christmas, we wanted to find something within walking distance that had salads and sandwiches and had a sports bar atmosphere. Bingo!  Hob Nob fit the bill.  It was quiet when we got there but filled up quickly on the Saturday before Christmas. We sat at the bar and had plenty of TVs in view. My husband had the cheeseburger and fries he wanted, which was cooked to perfection and the fries were great. I needed a salad and ordered the chicken Caesar salad.  Yes, it comes on a plate (which is pretty common in my experience) but it was a very large, very full plate with a perfectly grilled chicken breast over Caesar salad with just the right amount of dressing. And pita bread points rimmed the plate.  A glass of Chardonnay went perfectly with the salad. Our bartender/server was attentive and friendly. We are very glad we discovered Hob Nob and hope to return again next year!!  PS. I would give it five stars but haven't yet found the perfect place....  This was darned close tho!"}
{"text":"What makes a great sports bar?  1.) Lots of beer on draft? 2.) As many tvs as there are sports games that day? 3.) Darts, pool tables, and other bar games so you can also feel like an athlete? (or Drunken athlete....) 4.) Munchies to keep you fed and happy throughout the halftime shows and commercial breaks? 5.) How bout owners that can be a variable sports encyclopedia when the arguements get heated over stats and team accomplishments?  Yea these make a great sports bar and every one of these describes the HOB NOB... From its roots outside of Chi to the up and coming city of Chandler, AZ this bar and bar family has a history that make it the type of niche sports bar that'll bring you in for every big game...   Kick back, pick your tv, pick your channel, pick your beer, and be a sports fan!!  OPA! (oh yea theres a bit of a greek influence for all those saganaki and gyro fans)"}
{"text":"I have been to this bar on a few occasions, the last was on Christmas Eve. The staff was fantastic and the food was great, I like the atmosphere and the entertainment options."}
{"text":"Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff.   If time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob."}
{"text":"Great bar feel. The poppers were delicious and the beer on tap was great. Great service . TV s at every table was a plus. I'll be back on Sunday for football."}
{"text":"Pretty chill environment plus best wings in town the lady's at the bar are not so bad either I would recommend this place anyday if you come on Monday you can try the wings half off"}
{"text":"Great service and the chicken ranch sandwich was very good.  And since the special was chicken sandwich it was only 5.50. I recommend this place for a nice lunch. I have not been here after 4:00 so I can't comment on the food and service, and the clientele in the evening but the lunch crowd seems pretty mellow. Check it out ."}
{"text":"I loved their chicken wings! They were so delicious and my husband got a cheeseburger that he said was amazing! The lady who was working was also very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"PLASMA SCREEN TV's,  are everywhere you look!  If you head out on the patio to have a smoke there is one placed just inside the window so you do not miss any of your favorite game.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere fun and accepting.  I have been here several times and have enjoyed the wings (better than long wongs), the nagasaki (sizziling cheese caught on fire in front of you and served with Pita) and of course their mouth watering sliders!  The excellent service, partnered with the friendly owners who make it a point to say hi to the patrons add the final layer of icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"So I saw the reviews and triggered by the recent power outage I decided to go have dinner and a few cold ones at this place.  The selection is good enough and the price is fairly cheap. Now the quality fits the price point. When it's cheap one should not expect grandeur, and I didn't.   Chicken wings - alright, nothing special at all. Plus for the choice between breaded of naked, and they are half off on Mondays. Cool. Gyro - you know what, for a sports bar I do approve of this dish. I mean, if I want a great Gyro I would not come to this place, but for a spontaneous choice over a few cold - it was surprisingly fresh.  Fried cheese curds - my first time. I thought it was alright.  Onion Rings - not by type. This was the heavy breaded pre-fab kind.   For a sports bar a decent amount of TVs and I felt quite left alone, in a good way. I can see this place having an appeal for people, and I could see myself going here if I wanted to see a particular game or fight. But for a staple in my book, this place will not make it in. The service was alright. I have no complaints, but I wouldn't rave about it either. Run of the mill, and that is not necessary a bad thing. It is a standard sports bar."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere...great prices...great food ( rib night on wed-- $8.95 for a 1/2 rack dinner!) and the gyros are huge and authentic! ( ru kidiin' me?!? the owners are greeks from chicago!) plenty of tv's....nice patio for the smoker's music once a month with chuck e. baby and the all stars acoustic jam (2nd wed of the month). poker on wed, too.  dj on the weekend.nothing fancy about this place, but not a dive like some of the other sports bars in chandler : (like nate's 3rd base-- that place sucks!). the hob-nob is a great place for lunch , dinner, or just to hang out. be careful on bears game day! the place is packed!"}
{"text":"Wings, burgers, beer ... lots of sports ... all high quality with a friendly attitude"}
{"text":"Awesome little Chicago Sports bar. All the teams, lots of cool decor. The chili was very good and Chicago like! They allow kids and have a good friendly atmosphere. Prices are average. If you go during a Bears game you won't forget it."}
{"text":"In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice."}
{"text":"http://hobnobsport.com/  these people are horrifying! food is gross. oh wait its because their staff is drunk the whole time! my husband who is black, not normally as issue with us, goes to the bar waits literally 10 minutes to get me a glass of wine. then i say let me go up next. we time it and i get my drink in 36 seconds, im white. not normally an issue again.  we start thinking, could this be a race issue? because it was so weird that no one else waited that long as we watched from our table - so we couldn't help but wonder.   this time we decide to give them the benefit of the doubt my husband goes to the bar, i see her talk to the person next to him, then walk all the way to the other end of the bar after making eye contact with him, no acknowledgment or anything.  he looks over at me and i motion to him that i see, because i have been looking the whole time. i go to stand beside him and then she decides to pour the wine finally  but instead of handing it to my husband, she hands it to me. even tho i wasnt the one who went up there in the first place with an empty glass.  so at the end of the night, my husband goes to get one more drink and the check as it is last call seeing how we only got there at midnight. everyone around him saw him with the glass and were looking at him almost in dismay like why isn't the bartender serving him.. it got uncomfortable  my wife comes up and the \"manager\" or \"owner\" is in the bar area and as weill wait with no drink no tab, he looks at me and i say \"worst bartender ever\" and he comes up in my face and says shes a great bartender blah blah blah and if you dont like it dont fucking come back\"   wow  not certain if that guy was really management we called when we got home and asked for the manager and were told that no manager was available that they had all left and they also said well we only had one server so we said does that make it okay to tell a customer to \"just dont come back then\" - then after getting hung up on i called back and the \"owner\" answered and i told him what happened and he said basically sorry but im short staffed and youre gonna just have to deal with that kind of treatment.....  omg  are you serious??  this is horrific!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I often pop in here for happy hour during part of our daughters volleyball club practice just around the corner. Scotty, a server and bartender remembers our names. Often we just snack on fried cheese curds. I like the fried chicken  wings and I thought their fish fry was some of the best I've had-not too much breaking. Hubby says the gyro is very good. We like that they will put on any sports channel at the private TV at your booth. People really seem to enjoy trivia night. They get a nice crowd of friendly teams. Very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Haven't been back in four years plus. This was my first bar I went to in Arizona when I was working nearby. It was packed for the ASU vs. UA football game then, but not so raucous at a recent happy hour. No idea what I ate that night, but on my return I enjoyed some pretty incredible hand breaded mozzarella sticks for only $5 at happy Hour. The large 22OZ domestic beers were fairly priced at $3.50 per pop and the bartender was not only very friendly, but probably should be modeling somewhere. It is a Chicago bar, but that happens alot in Arizona, but I was able to watch the Yankees game with no issues. Good bar if your in the area for happy Hour."}
{"text":"Another dive. My friend used to bartend here so we came here while I was in town. At least they had my usual Grey Goose fare. They had a DJ that is really, wedding-DJ status, playing songs from A-Z whatever their genre may be. Nice guy though. Pretty much nobody dancing. Lots out in the patio smoking. A decent place to come grab a drink and be a bar fly. OH and there are Poker tables. Not sure if their were tournaments going on or the \"guys\" just get together here and use the table."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in this place and waiting on someone to take my foot order for almost 30 minutes now. Wait staff is useless. Sound is up so loud I can't even hear myself talk. I'd leave but I need to pay for the drink I ordered and have finished while waiting to order food. Quite possibly the worst place I've been to in years."}
{"text":"What a great sports bar!!! Finally something with a little class rolls into the neighborhood.  Flat screens at every booth with HD in your face!  The wings are to die for - I prefer getting the sauce on the side - try it... it is amazing!!!  As for the Saganaki or whatever they call it - a little fried cheese appetizer, it is out of this world good - just make sure you are ready for the presentation!  Hopa!  Burgers are freshly made everyday and half-off on Tuesdays!!!  Two Greek brothers own the joint and swear by everything \"Chicago\" so be prepared for a little culture while your there.  Top it all with great service, and this place is for real...  I frequent whenever I can to enjoy the great atmoshpere."}
{"text":"Great home town bar with real people, real food, and really good service.  The blonde bartender is the sexiest chick I know... and the DJ rocks!!!!!"}
{"text":"On Saturday I had done a bunch of painting in the house, so we decided to spend the night out at a hotel and let the house air out.  We stayed at the Hampton Inn right across the street and walked over to Hob Nob.  It was a difficult decision to not go to Rudy's trust me.    Hob Nob was a pleasant surprise.  I thought we'd just sit and have a couple of drinks and some apps, but the food turned out to be good and on par with some of the other good sports bars in the area.  We started with a Moscow mule for me ($6) and a gluten-free beer from WI that my husband wanted to try just to see what it tasted like.  It was a nice, crisp pilsner.  We shared the small nachos with ground beef and those were good and cheesy and the salsa was nice and spicy.  That brought on a 2nd round of drinks.  Mules all around.  Then I had the patty melt with 50/50 o rings and tots, and he ordered the pulled pork sliders.  I thought the sliders were a great deal getting 5 per order.  The buns were Hawaiian-style which is always good, and the pork was fine, but tasted like it came out of a plastic container.  The pickles helped.    My patty melt was excellent.  The burger tastes like good 80/20, and I really liked that you can get 50/50 of fries, o rings, or tots.  The onion rings taste EXACTLY like Dairy Queen's.  Exactly.  Danelle was our server and she was friendly and fun to talk to.  We got a kick out of the guys playing pool near us with all the smack talk going on.  Pretty entertaining.  They have some dart boards too, and TVs everywhere.  Overall, I would definitely return to Hob Nob, in spite of it being a Chicago sports bar.  (GO RED BIRDS!....I don't know about anyone else, but I am so ready for baseball season)."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood bar with lots of hardcore sports fans.  Went in there on a Sunday and had their daily special, the rack of ribs, which were really quite outstanding for being from a neighborhood sports bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for Chicago sports, thanks for bringing that to the area! The food is just OK, but also cheap. If this place could somehow bring in food from Lobby's Burgers Beef and Dogs in Tempe it would be a 5."}
{"text":"After about 7 hours drinking here I can now properly review this establishment  The service is excellent, food good,  overall experience was very good. Will definitely be back.   Met the owners, Andy & John,  and they are customer oriented and are definitely working the business to make sure their customers are happy. Prices for beer and spirits are in the low end for the bars in the area. Happy Hour prices for beer are 2 $ 2 - $4 and spirits $ 3.50 - $ 5. We drink rum and their best is Captain at $ 5.  Most establishments in the area don't carry a large upscale selection of premium rum brands. For great selections I have to rely on my home run bar.  The facility has TV's located over the bar and even at the booths. There is great seating and no reason not to be able to see your favorite sport.  The bar is billed as a Chicago bar, so they have all of the Windy City sports when they play. Don't let that stop you from visiting this place it is a fun bar and the people are friendly. They have entertainment on weekends. Since this was my first stop I will be checking in on their schedule to see what other nights have to offer."}
{"text":"Delicious fall-off the bone ribs -Sunday special. $16.95 for a slab-includes salad and fries. Hand made mozzarella sticks -yummy# Fun Chicago decor. Bartender was very friendly and helpful. Dart boards and many tvs to watch sports. This Chicago girl was thrilled to be there. Thank you for sharing Chicago with AZ."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to socialize if you are lookin for one . I was in town for a few days for training and stopped in to get a bite and a drink the people are very friendly ans the food is great . I was served by Megan and she was great very nice and friendly .It's packed during evenings and sports on all the tvs . Drinks are reasonable and they keep you filled . I will defiantly be back when I come back in town ."}
{"text":"Great place for Chicago transplants.  Good times and good place for Chicago sports fans.  Not too many healthy food choices on this menu, but hey, that's not what we're coming here for!"}
{"text":"Went here again the other night, and Hob Nob seemed to have lost a bit of its luster. The place reeked of stale beer. Someone needs to go through there with a mop & bucket ASAP. Not very appetizing. We also tried something new: the potato skins. Completely flavorless. Kind of a letdown.  Don't get me wrong, I still like this place, but after a couple more visits--most notably the last one--I think 4-Stars is a more accurate rating for Hob Nob."}
{"text":"A few notches better than your typical dive bar, but we come here for the atmosphere. It's an official Chicago Bears bar!! Win, lose, or draw you're surrounded by family.  BEARS FOR LIFE!!!"}
{"text":"This sports bar had a great Chicago atmosphere and was fun to watch the game. The food was also much better than I expected. That being said, I ordered a tall bud light off draft and it was rather warm. I then changed to a bottled 312 in hopes that it would be colder, but alas, it was not."}
{"text":"This place is legit nothing fancy but they have a great happy hour on drinks and food.  Two Chicago style hot dogs and french fries $4.95 on Monday's which is the night we were there.  $5 shots.  $3.50 for a very tall glass maybe ( 30 OZ ??? ) of budweiser and bud lite drafts my choice of beers.   Draft was FRESH  and they had half price wings on this night.  Two pool tables.  Two dart boards.  One of those newer jukeboxes that you see in a lot of bars now.  It appears they have karoake on some nights.  I don't smoke but you can still chill out on the smoking patio because they have this sucking ventilation that sucks the smoke out I guess.  Very chill. All the patrons at least on this night were very laid back and fun to be around.  Staff were cool and quick with the drinks.  Jenna the bartender was sexy.  I live on the Westside but this is a great east valley bar.  We only came across this bar after meeting some guests at the nearby hotel we were staying at for a quick get a way.  Great time !"}
{"text":"I wondered in, looking for the traditional comfort, bar type food. I received a perfectly cooked burger and delicious onion rings. The beer is cold and refreshing from the tap. The service was on point and friendly. Definitely a Chicago fan bar with a great atmosphere. I will eat here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicago bar in Chandler. Good beers, darts and pool tables.  Love the Chicago decor.   Going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd and last time I will ever buy a beer or burger from Hob Nob. Apparently this weekend the owners had a 9 year anniversary party... not knowing until we sat at the bar... spoke with Andrea and she stated  that they have a pig roasting out back.... so... just to check it  out... yup. It was there.  Curious about the food buffet...I asked one of  the owners...He stated that this party was for regulars and that it would cost 9.95 per person... So, we ordered wings and fries with a couple of beers.  I was astonished...The owner singled us out and was very rude in the process.  I don't care if Hob Nob had 9 years or 2 months left. Absolutely rude owner.  Should you want to swing by a bar..  in East ahwatukee.. I would not recommend Hob Nob."}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer, lots of Chicago fans. It's a really fun place to watch a game and slam coldies."}
{"text":"Horrible service!   I was in town on business last week and was looking for a place to get a beer, some food, and watch the Warriors game. I walk in, go up to the bar, and order a drink. I didn't know the Blackhawks game was about to start, and it was showing on every screen. I asked the bartender if any screen would be showing the basketball game, and that I was willing to move to another table to watch it. She said yes, and another bartender directed me to a booth which was showing the basketball game. I paid for my beer and moved to the booth.  Twenty minutes goes by. I finished my beer, and NOT ONE server has come by to check on me, give me a menu, etc. The place wasn't even crowded. I got up and left. I went to the Hurricane Bar & Grill down the street where the service was excellent.  Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Went to SLOB Nob last night and our group of 5 had two tabs that were closed out earlier that night. One of the people in our group decided they weren't ready to leave yet so they decided to get TWO more drinks. The bartender then comes up to us and says we hadn't paid for our drinks and shows us an itemized bill of drinks that we already paid for and closed out. We asked to speak to the manager and he didn't even want to hear what we had to say. He immediately came to our table and said we had two choices; either pay the tab or he is calling the police. We told him to call the police and shortly after, they arrived. Long story short, we had our receipts which showed proof that we paid and the owner still only removed half of the drinks from the bill. In summation, the owner tried to rip us off because he and his staff were taking shots while on duty... this place is TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for easily being the best fan-based sports bar in Phoenix. This place is crawling with Cubs fans in support for the World Series chase. They are playing the audio and appropriately themed music between breaks. Thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"I moved out here from Chicago about 7 months ago and some friends of mine that live in my apartment complex told me to check out this bar.  It is what it is.  It's a freaking dive bar that smells like farts.  For anyone familiar with the Chicagoland area, it reminded me a bit like Bridgeport.  That same peanuts and nasty fart smell that occupies stank ass Bridgeport and Stickney.  Needless to say, I love sports but hate dive bars.  There's no disguises here.  If you're looking for a dive bar/a place just to stop off and grab a beer without looking your best, come here."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible. Ordered chicken tenders and fries & my boyfriend ordered Texas Burger - the chicken had absolutely no flavor to it nor did the actual meat to his burger.  His bun was cold - obviously taken right out of the packaging. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is rough sometimes, but the owners are always very friendly! I frequent this place regularly."}
{"text":"Projection TV's, table TV's, pool table, darts, awesome specials, decent bar food, attentive and friendly staff! Grand Slam, even if it's a Chicago bar"}
{"text":"The food is OK bar food but if you are a Chicago sports fan you HAVE to check out this place. Everything Chicago, and the people are rowdy and fun, even if you are rooting for the other team. My wife and I went here to watch the bruins because they were our second team (after the yotes) but have been converted to Blackhawk fans instead. The songs they play between periods have new lyrics to promote the Chicago team playing that night and there are bunches of TV's to watch the game. Five stars for atmosphere and fun!"}
{"text":"Place for Chicagoans to go when they're homesick or want to watch a game.  The atmosphere here is what makes it a 4 instead of just a 3.  The Chicago sports memorabilia is EVERYWHERE!  There is even a stuffed bear here.   We came here for a few Blackhawks games as well as the Stanley Cup game.  The last time they won the cup I was on Clark St. in Chicago (ya know the street they show on the news after the win).  So I was not expecting the celebration that erupted at this place to be on par, but it really was!  Aside from the riots in the street it was just as exciting here at Hob Nob. I love the TV's at the booths, the projector and the fact that the same game is on every TV.  This is something I really have missed since moving to AZ.  There have literally been sports bars here that have refused to change the TV from girls softball to an NBA playoff game...uhh ok?  This place actually understands sports. They do lose a star for their lackluster menu.  Nothing on the menu is great.  It is all just OK.  The spinach dip and cheese curds are my best recommendations, but even those are pretty standard.  I say you definitely come here when there's a game on, but skip it for your dinner date."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night with two other friends. We were all greeted by the rudest waitress I've had in my life. We were all in agreement that she seemed angry that we were there. Not friendly at all and for this I'm giving a zero star review. Management needs to pay more attention. I will not return."}
{"text":"After attending a spring training baseball game in Goodyear, we drove south and stopped at the Hob Nob Sports Grill for a early dinner.  My wife had the Fiesta Bowl (similar to a taco salad) and I had the rib-eye/3 shrimp dinner.  Both of the meals were good but not great.  If you like the charcoal flavor on a steak, you will like their grilling.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Hob Nob I am so happy to have you in my life :}  This is the place to be for GREAT food and GREAT football! Da Bears have the ultimate den here!  But not ONLY do they have the Chicago passion for football, but they also stay true to Chicago's passion of food! The chips and salsa had great flavor, the chips weren't some paper thin rice cake they had substance! and the salsa had just enough spice to keep you coming back for more!   They claim their gyros are the best and I have to AGREE 100% tender meat, full of FLAVOR (not salt) and the pita never got soggy. MmmMMm  Some of my highlights from tonight: - GREAT food - Da Bears fight song whenever we scored - Da Bears shuffle and other Bear-tribute songs during half-time - All the Chicago fans - The owner coming out and giving high-fives to all the Bears fans even when things were looking bleak. :}  Thank you Hob Nob, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Jenna is the best and bartender in the world!  Pours a great drink!  Can't miss her. She is the one with the beautiful eyes!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Sports Bar in the west Chandler/ Awahtukee area this is the place. It is the old First Round Draft Bar that we use to go 20 years ago and hasn't changed much on the inside, But the food was a pleasant surprise! We tried their wings which were tasty and huge! Also tried the pork Sliders and they were good as well. We liked that each booth had its own T.V. besides all the big screen TVs around the room.  On our second visit the wings were as good as the first but we tried the Honey BBQ wings and the originals; 7 of each. I did preferred the original over the honey this time. Since the wings are so filling we split a 1/2 rack of ribs on the suggestion of Jenna our waitress/bartender and it was perfect. The meat literally fell off the bone and it was a nice side portion and came with a salad and fries for $11.95. Looking forward to trying something different next time."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have really enjoyed the food, drinks and staff. Pool table and soft-tip darts a plus."}
{"text":"I'm a die-hard Bears fan and I've lived in this area for over 10 years.  I stumbled across this place on Yelp and had to try it out.  It was a Sunday and Da Bears were playing Green Bay.  I figured I'd get there about 20 minutes before kickoff to get a seat at the bar.  WRONG!!!  This joint was packed wall to wall with some of the most loyal Bears fans I've seen since Chicago.  I  ended up having to stand since there wasn't an empty seat in the place.  Of course like others mention, the Bears fight song after each touchdown, Sinatra singing Chicago at half-time.  I was home for just those short few hours.  The bartender ( I swore I'd remember her name but forgot) was so cool and always had a smile on her face despite being slammed two deep at the bar.  Didn't try the food because I had no where to eat it, but plan on going back again and again.  I've been going to my local bar around the corner, but this place is worth the extra few miles for me."}
{"text":"The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!! TV's everywhere, if you love sports and beer this is the place for you!! The nob has events all week and food specials to go along... the ribs are amazing!! however the GYRO is good as it gets!!

{"text":"Good food and great service, giving us from Chicago a place to call home. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Karaoke, drink specials, pool, questions game, and much more! This place is fun for groups and very entertaining! Everyone was very friendly and down to have a good time!"}
{"text":"Tuesday. $3 Coronas, 1/2 price Burgers that were good, super nice people working there and watching games and a quick walk from the Hampton. Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"What a great spot, my wife and I are traveling and this place hit the spot. Their happy hour selection is great, I had the pulled pork. Try build your own tacos!"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar. It has it all! The DJ is great, always playing some great tracks and there's even a little dance floor for you to shake your booty. The food is really tasty too. Bar food is hit or miss and this place is a real hit! You must try the nachos! They have Ginormousize nachos which are just that, ginormous!! They use real melted cheese not like that gross cheese sauce that other places use. The Mushroom Swiss burger is soo good!! They have daily specials that are only for dine-in and trust me, they're totally special! This place is great to hang out with friends, catch a game, and just have a great time!"}
{"text":"Decent sports bar. It was close to my hotel & wanted something laid back with food. I had a buffalo sandwich. It was bigger than expecting & tasted great. The service could have been a little better but it was during the week & a little busy. The server had another customer that wouldn't leave her alone...so understood to a certain degree it wasn't all her fault. Overall, if I stay in that area again, I'd go back :)"}
{"text":"I've only been in for breakfast, so I think it's okay to still hold that last star hostage...  Their breakfast menu is brand-spankin'-new and INCREDIBLE.  Their chef, Adam, knows what he's doing.  I met up with some girlfriends for brunch there last weekend and WOW. Absolutely the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.  There's a grilled avacado snuck in there, and the Hollandaise sauce has a cilantro kick (not a cilantro fan, but this is way mild).  Then there's the red pepper sauce that's drizzled over that.  My mouth is now watering and it's 10pm. And I haven't even mentioned the Bloody Mary.... eh, make that plural, it was brunch.  I also managed to snag a bite (or several) of my girlfriend's Strawberry Pancakes. For the record, I despise pancakes.  She said they were different, and the best she'd had, so I trusted and tasted. And then tasted about 5 more times.  ::sheepish grin::  I don't know what sort of miracle he whipped into that batter but DAMN! The guy knows how to make a stack of hot cakes.  Since the girls and I decided it'll be a monthly event, I'm going to beg Adam weekly to have a Nutella-stuffed French Toast waiting for me next time.  He stuffs French Toast with everything else!  I'm stoked that football season is about to kick into full gear - I'm guessing beer and whatever other surprises Adam starts whipping up will be beckoning me.  And then, that, with the Raiders on massive TVs, Hob Nob will receive that coveted 5th star."}
{"text":"First check in on 4sq every time you come. Penny beer every 5th trip. It's all about the naked grilled  wings. I get mine hot. Not a fan of the breaded wings, but naked with no breading are fantastic. Also say hi to Eva behind the bar. She's great at what she does."}
{"text":"My fiance and I go down to Hob Nob almost every Thursday. 1/2 off chicken sandwiches and $5 domestic pitchers = AWESOME! Trivia and Karaoke. Jenna the bartender is great! Lots of TV's with sports :) I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Very quiet local bar dedicated to Chicago. They have a decent number of TVs. We went for happy hour. The beer came in a huge glass which was cheap for how much they give. We ordered the artichoke dip and Chicago dog. The artichoke dip was okay but the Chicago dog wasn't that good (we had better at a food cart in Austin, TX). We wouldn't mind coming again for a quiet, low key hh."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for happy hour 5 dollar burgers. I noticed there was only one waitress and it took a while for her to get to our table to take our order. They did not seem to be super busy. We first ordered spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress said it was not home made. And, well it tasted like something you could by at the grocery store. I ordered a burger well done with fried onions and it ended up being medium rare. I sent it back and after another long 20/30 minute wait the new burger I had was medium rare with no onions on it. My husband's food ended up okay. You do get a huge portion of fries/onion rings. The manager came over and apologized and said he had new cooks that just started, and the waitress was very nice and apologetic. I guess their entire system crashed so things were chaotic. They did not charge me for the burger, but I did not eat any of it anyways. But, I am thinking a cook that does not know how to cook a burger will definitely not help the place. As far as the décor, it is all Chicago sports themed which makes it unique. I was disappointed at the outside seating. There were only 4 tables that were enclosed in a tight area and 3 of them had smokers sitting out there so being a non smoker I chose to eat inside, even though my husband and I planned on eating outside on our way there. This was our first time trying the place, and I am not sure I want to go back for the food unless they get different cooks."}
{"text":"Great late night Chicago style car and grill. I often am working late or play hockey late. This means I don't get a chance to eat sometimes before 10/11 or even midnight. Hob Nob has standard late night menu but it has three things going for it :  First, the appys are actually good. I had the mozzarella cheese sticks and they were both massive and tasty, plus the marinara sauce that came with was perfect. Our table also had 21 of their hot wings which were equally excellent.   Second, they keep the late night foods available until 1:30 or 2am. Most grills close their kitchen as early as midnight or even 10pm.   Third, the staff was awesome and responsive. Quick to welcome you when you get there and attentive whenever you needed something.  Definitely a place I'll be going back to!"}
{"text":"Really cool locals only hang out. If you are a South Chicago sports fan you are in luck. No worries they don't hold it against you if your not. The food is quite good for bar food. The artichoke dip is excellent and burgers are tasty. Nightly specials make it all the more better. Service is better then most bars. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pricey. The salads are served on a PLATE! So you don't get much for $10...  They do have several nice hot sauces.  Chicago Bears, Bulls and Sox bar, which is nice.   Can only see one TV at each bar seat.  Pool, darts and poker.  Patio has a nice TV."}
{"text":"Came here today at 1:30 pm and sat at the bar. There was one Server here Aaron - absolutely gorgeous who had the bar and tables but she came by over and over to check on my drink. Incredible service and I got the BB ribs - cut with a fork off the bone - no mess. Next door to my hotel - saw on Yelp and went for it. Could not be more satisfied. Ordered a special drink and it was made to perfection. Felt sad having to leave. Lots of locals here and  Aaron knew them all. Cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"The Hob Nob Sports Grill is on of the best places to watch your local sports team in action.  I believe during Suns games they offer half off of their wings (insider tip: order these wings sauce-less and get the sauce on the side, trust me....you won't regret it).    The owners are from the windy city, so if you're looking for a place to watch the Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks or the SOX, this is your place.  The beers are always cold, the liquor is always flowin, the DJ is usually spinnin and maybe if you're lucky, the owners just might let you play some beer pong or WII on the big screen!  I also recommend the burgers here, they hand roll their patties, the burgers are fresh and juicy, just like dad's backyard BBQ."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sport grill for about three years now. I work across the street and this has been our go-to after work place forever. The happy hour prices for drinks cannot be beat, and they have a wide variety of appetizers for half price. Seeing as how their happy hour is pretty much all day you'd be hard pressed to go here and spend more than $20. The appetizers are about what you would expect from a sport bar, a deep fried oasis of golden brown. However, there is some hope: if you are more adventurous, you can come in during lunch on the weekdays when they have specials, and get a half priced burger, or chicken sandwich for under $5. They have some traditional geek food as well (i think the owners are greek or something). Their gyro is delicious and they have some good chicago style hot dogs as well.   Overall, this is a great place to hang out and have a good time without spending a ton of money."}
{"text":"Don't. Order the chicken tenders got no flavor and there using old grease ordered a strawberry cheesecake couldn't even eat it suppose to be soft not frozen way too many dudes in here"}
{"text":"Fun place to drink and have fun! There's a little dance floor and DJ which I really enjoy. There is also pool tables and poker for the non-dancers. The food is great, along with the service. I liked that there were individual TVs at the tables. Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends and eat some good food!"}
{"text":"had a little cricket cross my path in the restroom. that's supposed to be good luck, right?  if you like dive bars, you'll be just fine"}
{"text":"Two and half stars at best.  Ordered cheese burger and drink, when delivered that was the last time I saw the waitress/ bar keep until I was finished.  No checkup on my food or drink.   The cheeseburger was pretty bland, not memorable.   When it came time to pay the bill the ink pen was dried out, no ink. I went to the bar and it took a long time to get her attention I needed another ink pen.  Won't be back!! Unpleasant experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Deals on food only apply to dine in customers.   I don't llike arbitrary rules. if you have a deal on eats, honor it and I will be a returning customer.   oh well."}
{"text":"I ventured into enemy territory to watch my detroit lions take on the chicago bears. And I came here because I couldnt think of any other establishment that would be showcasing a game between 2 of the shittiest teams in the nfl on a sunday morning.    I was a little concerned at first that I might not like the environment too much because it comes off as really divey and you never know how football fans will behave.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The fans were very friendly while cheering intensely for their team.  The $8 all you can eat breakfast buffet that goes til 11am wasnt bad, I enjoyed the eggs, bacon, potatoes, & toast.    This bar does alot for their fans & it's really entertaining to watch all the patrons sing a long to their Chicago Bears song whenever they score.  I'd definitely recommend this place to any football fan."}
{"text":"We came tried fron being at the NASCAR race all day.  Great food and service!  Has everything for the whole family."}
{"text":"For a sports bar it has great food. Both the pineapple chicken sandwich and the gyro was delicious (side salad not so much). There was live music. SUPER FRIENDLY staff. Entrees from about $7-$16. Kitchen is open until 1:00am. There is an outdoor patio and a TON of TVs."}
{"text":"Owners are incredibly nice at this Chicago sports bar.  White Sox and Blackhawks only... Cubs fans need not apply. They definitely know how to pour a stiff drink here which is a positive. Order double shots of Jamison and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"There a foul beer smell as soon as I walked in and there is no pool table here, please update your ad that you have a pool table"}
