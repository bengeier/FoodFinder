{"text":"Relocated to Five Points in Amherst. Fast service, decent pizza, but honestly pretty greasy. I liked the sauce. But...it's still Olde Town for me"}
{"text":"Lousy pizza, outstanding breadsticks, grumpy proprietor.  I do not recommend this pizza or this restaurant.  They are only a block from the best two pizza places in town, don't know why they would try offering lousy pizza at the same price with no concept of making the customer feel welcome or at ease.  
The high school kid waiting on us was the exception.  He was not a good waiter, but he did his best to make our dining experience less miserable."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance to this pizza place and Old Towne and 9 times out of 10 we will chose D'Tut's. More expensive than pizza Hut or domino's, but significantly better. I will be a repeat customer for a long long time. Try the meatball stromboli!"}
{"text":"For all of my almost 40 years I have had a love affair with all things pizza. This pizza reminded me of a pizza from my childhood in Akron, Ohio. It's more expensive than the chain pizza shops but well worth it. Not going to be everyone's most loved pizza but everyone should give it a try."}
{"text":"As a follow up to my previous review, an owner called us a few days later and apologized.  She offered us a free pizza for our trouble and it was very, very good.  The crust was really quite spectacular and the pizza was composed of high quality ingredients.  We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Pizza, wings and apps have all been great. I'll explain why it's 2 stars and why they've lost my business. This review is for the Avon store. I've ordered 4 times. 2 times I've picked up, 2 times I've had it delivered. Both times delivered its been 20 min late and the latest time was 45 min late. Still new, yes, great food yes but I just can't continue to support a shop when it takes 90 plus minutes ordering food at 430pm ."}

{"text":"Phenomenal pizza. First experience was getting their GIANT pizza to have at home, and we were hooked. We even posted pictures of our kids with the monster-sized pizza. Their dining room is extremely family friendly, and the complementary pepperoni bread is delicious."}
{"text":"Such a great experience! Brought my family here for something a bit different (we usually get takeout). The server was awesome and the food was amazing! I highly recommend the stuffed crust!"}
{"text":"Almost every single Friday my mom orders pizza here medium pepperoni and mushroom , I go there as much as possible it's harder since it's a long drive for me , but so worth the drive the pizza is made with love it is always so fresh they use the best quality cheese , sauce , dough meats and veggies. The salads a huge and greatly priced . The wings are also greatly priced and so good and meaty. The service is always great. The cheese bread is to die for with a very comfortable dining area. Truly a great small town pizza place doing big things . Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My first visit to D'Tuttenelli's. I had been seeing so many awesome pictures of their pizza on social media, I had been looking forward to this visit for months. My first impression... Employees were far from friendly, let alone hospitable. Hospitality, something that we all look forward to when dining out! So, I ordered their \"Pizza Supremo\"... Which I'd supposed to have FIVE toppings. I couldn't believe it when I opened the box in front of D'Tuttenell's employee... I immediately told her how disappointed I was, pointing out to her several slices of pizza that had barely anything! For $19.99, I surely expected a significant amount more toppings than I saw! Employee went & got the \"cook\" to address this issue, THIS employee just came right out and told me, \"well, that's the way we make our pizza!\" OK, I just indicated how disappointed I was, silence. Then, I asked if we could enjoy our pizza on their porch, which had tables & chairs, & they said, \"yeah\". Never offering us plates or napkins, SO unprofessional... I NEVER felt so unwelcomed in a restaurant, in my life. My reviews are mostly positive ones, because that's usually the impression that I receive, my visit to this establishment was extraordinary... #UnsatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Veggie pizza was delightful, artichokes were not artijoking. Also got the 'choke dip-no complaints here! One thing I feel very strongly about is how we're charged 2.50 for being \"out of the area\". We're 3 miles out. A friend who is of respectable moral aptitude is a mile away and is also charged this \"out of area\" charge. What a racket! Call it delivery charge and call it a day. PS great teriyaki wings. PPS all the delivery drivers know me by name. PPPS we like to call it dtutes. Hope it catches on. Take care."}
{"text":"Great pizza. A little pricey but worth the money. It's perfect for that evening when you want something other than boring Marcos pizza. We were very impressed with what we got and we will be visiting there again. Another plus is that they also deliver. When you have kids at home, that is a huge plus for us! Thank you for giving Amherst something to look forward to. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I definitely plan on coming back in the future. D'Tutanelli's has one of the best pizzas i've had in this area. I only wish it was a little closer to my home (i live about 15 minutes away, which isn't terribly bad).

The service was good and the food was great. I really like D'Tutanelli's Pizza."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was just ok.  I was not liking the price.  $18.99 was a little steep in my book.  I just don't see myself being a regular"}
{"text":"It was pizza.  Noting that stood out that was great, but it wasn't bad either."}
