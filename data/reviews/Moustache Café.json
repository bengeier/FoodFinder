{"text":"Endroit intéressant, café très bon et dans les prix.  Table dans le milieu, intéressant pour les étudiants."}
{"text":"Just turned into little Italy and they have a fab outdoor area and good communal table for cafe working. 

We had cold brew, chai latte and latte! The foam is the best I had!"}
{"text":"Great Coffee. Slow Service.

There's not much to say about this place other than it's small, intimate, and the coffee is wonderful. The staff *does* tend to move at their own pace, but you still don't wait that long.

However, don't count on getting a seat. The place is often full of students studying/working, so there's nowhere to sit, but if you're in the 'hood, it's definitely worth a stop to grab a cup of joe on the go."}
{"text":"I've been there yesterday to have a mid-afternoon coffee!
I ordered a cappuccino, it was good, excellent price!
My friend ordered a Chai Latte, this one was really tasty, it was served in a cool personalized mini-mustache-jar (photo).
We also had a banana bread slice, also good, nothing exceptional about it though!
The ambiance is really chill and calm, excellent to read a book, study, work, etc.
I'm definitely coming back for a Cappuccino and to do my work over there!"}
{"text":"The big drawback that keeps me from going too often is the big communal table that everyone shares. 

It is definitely not the spot for chit chatting since everyone will hear it, people seem to be working or studying.

Most people seem to like it that way but the outdoor seating works best for me since it lets me get some sun, some street life and can talk without bothering others.

The coffee is pretty decent, but oddly served in a water glass from Ikea. I tend to prefer takeout anyway."}
{"text":"Le service est impeccable. Un endroit sympathique. Un personnel attentionné. J'y suis allée à 2 reprises.

Le café (1ere visite) est bon, bien relevé.  La 2e visite m'a permis de découvrir les smoothies. Le choix est impressionnant. Il reste que c'est le meilleur smoothies à vie.

Je dois y retourner une 3e fois pour découvrir les gâteaux!"}
{"text":"Great café for some laptop time. Join the laptop line on the big central table, enjoy the best smoothies and cold press juices in town and pet the giant lazy Bernese dog. They have great cakes and muffins with vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"Beautiful coffee shop in the Mile-Ex, this place serves sandwiches, pastries, juices and coffee.

The place is  a cute and cozy establishment, completed with wooden furniture and floors. The WIFI is strong, they don't bother you and have multiple cable plugs.

The sandwiches are inexpensive and filling, the coffees are delicious, from the lattes to the cappuccinos, and the pastries are excellent. I personally never tried the juices but my friends think they are great.

Only small downside are the chairs can get quite stiff after a few hours.

Also be nice to the staff and don't buy an espresso and sit there for hours on end. Try to buy something every 2h or so at least."}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour étudier, être entre amis pour déguster un bon café ou pour casser la croûte. Et pourquoi pas se laisser tenter par une petite sucrerie. Smoothies à essayer!"}
{"text":"A small, local and cozy café located by St-Laurent street, close to Mile End. It's been newly renovated. I love their selection of coffees, home made smoothies and sweets. There is usually choice for vegans, which I consider an added value. I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Cute concept! Ambiance in a lot of Montreal cafes are either minimalistic, chic, modern, and/or nifty, but this is probably my favorite one by far! We ate there in order to check out their signature mustache mason jars, and it was adorable that when you drink out of it, it looks like you're wearing the mustache too!

My boyfriend got the solar power drink (vegetable/fruit smoothie I believe) and I got an iced vanilla latte with almond milk (they have many milk substitutes for my lactose intolerant pals out there). I thought the solar power drink was pretty unique and refreshing, so I wish I actually tried something new instead of settling for a basic iced latte. 

Outdoor seating and Wi-Fi are available too, and the tables outdoors have umbrellas so you can find shade from the sun. Many customers in the café seem to be there for studying off their laptops or reading, and I realized that this café was quiet and perfect for those types of customers. Definitely check this place out if you're in town!"}
{"text":"This coffeeshop is stylish, and while it's a bit small, it feels cozy rather than cramped. I ordered an almond milk latte that was delicious and my friend was even able to get a little cup of water for her dog without any issue. I will definitely come back here when I'm in the neighbourhood again!"}
{"text":"A Yelper friend suggested that we should hang out here before a Yelp event and I'm happy we did. The Cafe's name is moderately amusing at first but then it gets outright comical. So many Mustache puns can be had.

I went with a cappuccino, paid at the cash and sat down on the very large community table where a dozen patrons or so can sit down and enjoy their orders. There are also many smaller tables around the bigger table if you're the introverted type. The Cafe is small but the environment is warm and intimate. The decorations on the wall are obviously coffee related with the possibility of purchases such as coffee beans, coffee equipment and so forth.

The Cafe offers a variety of coffees and treats that was duly noted by my part for future visits. Everything is... well Mustache related and looked good. 

A few minutes later I got my cappuccino and I'll admit, it was quite excellent.

We sat down and chatted until we left, with the warm embrace of Moustache Cafe trailing behind us.

Oh and the FREE WIFI password is AMAZING."}
{"text":"The Moustache Cafe is a little coffee shop that is located off of Beaubien.  I wanted to stop by, due to the fact that there was a cute little 'mustache' sign that just enticed me to come in.  I'm glad that I did!  This cafe is small and has a limited communal seating arrangement and offers a variety of coffee beverages, tea, smoothies, and pastries.  I tried one of their fresh smoothies, the Brass Monkey - this contained fresh bananas, caramel, honey, etc.- it wasn't too thick, but a perfect thin creamy consistency that wasn't overly sweet.  I enjoyed it!  They also have a cute coffee serving set for sale, as well as their own brand of coffee beans.  The place is cute, with friendly staff and a nice vibe.  Free wi-fi also available!

+Brass Monkey smoothie :D
+friendly staff :D

{"text":"Neglect my review if you are not going to use their wifi. Read this if you plan to do work there

Went there to study but the wifi is very sloooow and disconnect very often..maybe it was a bad day:/ sandwiches are a bit pricy imo but great atmosphere and the music isn't too loud. 

Bottom line: DON'T go to study/work"}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee. I stop here several times in the morning on my way to work and they never disappoint. Most of the baristas know my order when I walk in. :)"}
{"text":"Avec une amie, nous avons pu profiter de la mini terrasse extérieur pour prendre un dernier bain de soleil estival. Les serveurs sont vraiment sympa. Il y a beaucoup de choix de boissons, hormis les cafés, notamment jus et smoothies fait maison dont je me suis laissée tentée!
Je ne me souviens pas de sa composition exacte (abricot et lait d'amande entre autres) mais il était vraiment bon! On sentait les produits de qualité et en bonne quantité.  
Bref, du choix, de la qualité, des gens nice!"}
{"text":"Un bel endroit pour travailler en paix ou organiser une rencontre. L'espace petit ne se remarque pas car une grande table au milieu du café permet d'accommoder plusieurs personnes.  La décoration est charmante et aérée avec des peintures sur les murs à vendre, beaucoup de bois, des ardoises, une entrée vitrée  et des petits objets surprenants comme une machine à écrire turquoise.  Cela permet de pouvoir travailler à l'intérieur durant l'été sans déprimer. L'ambiance très décontractée fait changement aux cafés bruyants remplis de gens pressés.  Une petite terrasse en avant et un immense berger allemand, si je me trompe pas de race de chien, contribue au charme de l'endroit. 

Pour ma première visite, j'ai essayé le smoothie \"Le vert\" aux concombres, pommes et kale. Il est très léger, rafraîchissant et pas du tout amer. Les nachos sont excellents aussi."}
{"text":"I still like this cafe! It's ok! The big fluffy puppy is worth a zillion stars! But the smoothies have lost their magic for me, I don't know what gives them a kind of gelatin-y quality but it's not my fav, and the sandwiches are totally ok but maybe not more than that. They still have some very tasty baked goods for sure, but I don't love the coffee there, maybe just because I love a light roast cup of filter coffee rather than a dark roasted espresso. 

It's really good and really friendly and I like the vibe for working or reading!! Glad it exists in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and big table. the coffee jugs with Moustache a nice touche."}
{"text":"This is a really nice cafe, as echoed by all the Yelpers below me.

As a non-coffee-drinker, I thought I would be hard-pressed to find something to drink, but amazingly they have a wide selection of smoothies and fresh pressed juices to choose from!

I've tried the Popeye, and the Brass Monkey so far, both were very delicious, and I look forward to trying the rest!

I've only visited twice, but each time I've been warmly welcomed by the staff and they were eager to help me make a smoothie decision.  They really care about patrons having a good experience, and I really appreciated that.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Montreal has an abundance of excellent coffee shops at its disposal.  In fact it can be hard to narrow down your choice when in need of a caffeine fix.  After seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Moustache Café I knew I needed to venture down to Little Italy and give it a try.
 
The cafe is warm and inviting.  Seating is at a premium here.  There is one large communal table and a handful of smaller ones so during busy times like weekends you might not get a table.  I went with a latte and slice of banana chocolate bread.  I really enjoyed the latte but the banana-chocolate bread was slightly stale.  The price was competitive and in line with what you would expect to pay at a place like this.  I will definitely be adding Moustache Café to my list of coffee shops that I like to frequent."}
{"text":"They have almond, soy and every other alternative milk available PLUS vegan/gluten free pastries. What more could you want in a coffee bar?! The ambience has a chill Brooklyn feel and a big community table. I will definitely come back! What a gem of a find in a cute neighborhood of Little Italy."}
{"text":"Café fort sympathique à la sauce \"hipster\". Le café est bon et il est préparé par des baristas qui savent ce qu'ils font. On nous offrent la possibilité de choisir notre lait favoris et pourquoi pas adopter une carte fidélité. Si vous n'aimez pas le café, ils offrent aussi des smoothies absolument délicieux. Parfait pour étudier en toute tranquillité. On peut même y manger une petite bouchée avec un menu de sandwichs qui vous plairont."}
{"text":"Nouvelle dans le quartier, j'ai découvert ce petit café assez récemment.

Dès l'extérieur, une petite terrasse toute mignonne nous accueille. L'intérieur est joliment décoré et serein par ses tons très pâles. Pour ce qui est de leur café, il est tout simplement excellent et le service est très sympa. J'ai hâte d'y retourner pour une séance d'étude !"}
{"text":"If I lived in Montreal, this feels like the perfect place to get work done or just enjoy a rainy afternoon. I enjoyed a simple coffee before moving on my way for a long walk through the city, but I absolutely loved the chill ambiance and lax yet funky personality of this spot. I wish I could have spent more time here."}
{"text":"Super café pour travailler solo ou prendre pour emporter et se promener dans le quartier. 

Leurs smoothies sont incroyables. 

Viennoiseries & café: 10/10 !"}
{"text":"Cute cafe in the Italian District. It was hard to choose what to eat or drink, as the display was overwhelmingly delicious looking. There are tons of sweet and savory options, as well as sandwiches they can make on the spot. Also, don't forget the smoothies and juices!

There's a large communal table, great for group working or sprawling out. In addition, there are a few tables and chairs outside of the cafe for al fresco dining and chit chat. 

Definitely thought-through decor without being over the top. I'm glad I had the chance to enjoy some kombucha while people watching on the street."}
