{"text":"We have come here about 5 times over the past year for Happy Hour. We usually come with other family members and have a great time. The prices for food and drink are very reasonable. The food and service are always good. I would recommend coming here and we will be back.  i would say this is a good place for a date night. it looks nice inside and the food looks fancy."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and one time I came in and the waiter didn't even speak English. Had trouble ordering."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. We had rolls from the happy hour menu and some specialty rolls. All were great. Friendly staff. Nice environment.  Would definitely recommend this sushi to anyone in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really like this place for dining-in. They're always friendly and quick, they have great prices and the food is pretty tasty. I don't like them for take out because they totally skimp on the serving sizes! It feels cheap, like because I'm leaving I won't be able to say anything about it. I've ordered the same dishes for eating in and taking out, and the portions are way better in."}
{"text":"I love eating here during happy hour! Definitely great deals & the sushi is delicious & fresh!"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour and sit at the bar. Poke salad is delish as is spicy tuna roll, waitresses leave much to be desired but the chefs friendliness makes it up."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Style for years. There food is amazing at very reasonable prices and that is why I keep going back. If it wasn't for the food I would probably never go back ever again. Almost every time I have been there or called for take out I have had an issue. At this point \"oh my gosh I'm so sorry\" is no longer acceptable. With this many issues there is a flaw in the business and employees. Don't get me wrong, some of the employees are wonderful and great at there jobs but as a consumer I feel responsible with sharing my experiences. Tonight I called in for to go and ordered 2 chicken fried rice with extra egg, tonkotsu ramen, and steamed gyoza. I got there and it took 19 minutes for them to figure out their card machine. I asked again if the gyoza was steamed and was assured that it was. While I was waiting on the card machine to work, I witnessed a server apologize to her table for any mistakes because she is new.... she has been there at least a year! The hostess who was working on the card machine told another server it was down, to which he replied, \"why is she telling me, I don't care!\" Then when I get home I find that the gyoza is fried and the ramen was sent without broth (it comes with broth). This is just one of many other issues I have experienced here and feel like some changes really need to be made. I called and shared my feedback in a polite way because I know it isn't just one person's fault, but I want to ensure my feedback gets through."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite sushi spot in the North Valley! The servers were very attentive, the sushi was fresh and delicious, and their garlic edamame sauce.....I could seriously eat cardboard and think it was a gourmet meal with that sauce on it.   Reverse happy hour is from 8pm to close and the prices cannot be beat for the quality. We will absolutely be back.......like tomorrow."}
{"text":"Never Again Went in for lunch, sat at the Bar.  One of the Sushi chefs began arguing with another staff member when we sat down, the argument escalated, and it was really awkward.   The sushi chef (calling him that for lack of a better word)  even began to say things like \"fuck this\" and so on...... While all of this is happening he is kind of making our sushi, he does have gloves on his hands, but begins to cough.  He then pulls fish out of the cooler, uncovers it looks at it, smells it clearly hesitates and then tosses the fish in the garbage.   Now he has coughed and grabbed bad fish with the same pair of gloves on his hands, he begins to make our sushi. We walked out.   Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Decent sushi and bubble tea at a reasonable price. We ordered from the lunch specials menu, which was rather limited and repetitive. Be sure to ask which rolls have mayo as some don't list it as an ingredient. The wait staff was nice, but not especially attentive. I paid with US currency as we had not yet gone to the exchange and they did not offer the exchange rate as other sit-down restaurants did."}
{"text":"Today was a total disappointment.  We ordered chompon, the seafood noodles. We waited half hour for it and I knew something was wrong.  And it turned out to be a big bowl of instant noodles with cheap spicy soup stock. Terrible, terrible food. Can't believe they charge over ten dollars for a bowl of instant noodle with just scarcy octopus in it."}
{"text":"Utterly top-notch quality for all the years I've been going. Across the United States and including all of Asia that I've sampled over the years, this is my #1 favorite Japanese place. The sign says \"Sushi\" and what they prepare and serve is unquestionably the very best. But there's far, far more. I'm a ramen fan; a nice big steaming bowl is just what I need some days. My favorite is the roast pork--someone in that kitchen sure knows what they're doing! My wife prefers the Bento at lunch time and always has enough leftovers for another meal. My recommendation is to check the daily specials on the white board to the left of the sushi bar. Several of my favorites come up there from time to time. The Kobe beef--yeah, you read that right, Kobe beef--with a very hot stone where you cook each bite to your preference was my final order today. Utterly indescribable other than \"I can die now.\" You can go cheap during happy hour and have your fill of fabulous sushi and be out the door for not a lot more than what you'd spend at a fast food joint. Or you can go all out and have a meal you will remember for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for take out lunch. Ordered the chicken teriyaki bento. They didn't skimp on the portions even if it was take out. It came with the usual miso soup, salad, California roll, 2 pieces of yam and shrimp tempura each, 2 pieces of gyoza, 2 small scoops of rice and the chicken.   The food was ready promptly, fresh, tasty and hit the spot. Friendly service, good value for money.  I've also had special sushi rolls here at dinner once and I found it to be fresh, well made and tasty as well. It's good that they don't use lots of rice to make the rolls seem huge. The sushi rice had a good taste too."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas roll was bomb! The miso soup was simple but delicious. I also really enjoyed the spicy crab roll. The reverse happy hour(8pm-10pm) was decently priced and we got a lot food for about $10 per person."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very friendly environment. Excellent sushi spot with great service. My wife and kids come here at least once a week, for the past 3 months. The owner recognizes us and hooks us up with free appetizers.  Defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sushi quality and freshness was amazing... On this visit my wife and I enjoyed a Vegas roll, crunchy roll and a rainbow roll.  All three rolls just tasted great... We will definitely be coming back...  The only reason I didn't give them 5 starts was because we had a coupon that was NOT honored by the owner because it didn't apply to \"Happy Hour\". The coupon didn't state that it was not valid during happy hour from 4pm to 7pm.  We would practically have to come in at 8pm to 9pm (closing is 9pm), in order, for us to redeem such coupon.  Big fail on their advertising but hey on the other hand they did make me come in to try the sushi..."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. I didn't think it was possible to have bad sushi, unless of course it caused you to become ill. But this is the first time I've had bad sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've found in the north valley, possibly all of AZ. Incredible food (got gyoza, spicy crab and las vegas rolls), will be back to try everything on the menu. The service was freakin great, fast as shit, fair price, and I am so happy I finally tried this place. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"James is a bit of a smart ass who does not seemed to be too concerned with customer service. I sat at the sushi bar and watched him take our menu with a gloved hand, hand it to the chefs in the back, take a sip from a cup, and proceed to take rice out of the bowl and touch the fish, WITHOUT removing the dirty gloves. wtf??  Twice I have gone in there and there has been no hostess and no one to come up to seat you.  Acknowledge your patrons, even if it means a quick, \"I'll be with you in a moment\".  The sushi is decent, otherwise."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix. Very fresh Sushi and their prices are very reasonable. The sushi staff and servers are great."}
{"text":"I love the neighborhood sushi place!  It is very comfortable and chill atmosphere.  It's high quality without the pretentiousness that's usually associated with quality sushi.  Perfect for date night, girls-guys night out or work functions!  Staff is amazing and chefs prepare nice dishes on and off the menu!   Recommend coming in try it out, you will fall in love with sushi again!  Happy hour and reverse happy hour prices can't be beat!  Drink prices are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"From out of town and was really impressed. Happy hour deals are killer. Service was good and we got our sushi within 10 minutes of ordering. Food was fresh and delicious. Some of the best sushi I've had"}
{"text":"Very good very fast service and very friendly we arrived 30 minutes before closing and we still received great service without being rushed!"}
{"text":"We go to this place for over 7 years at least once in a month , always order a lot for more than $100. It is very convenient close to our house , restaurant has decent happy hour after 8 PM. Customer service has been decreasing every time we are there. Owners must be blind!  Few months ago they tried to explain us that soft shell crab doesn't have to  have crab in end pieces of the roll, it will depend on the size of the crab.  ????  Then we were charged couple of extra $ for uni sashimi with explanation from the waitress that they forgot to change price in menu. What?  Are you ready to loose customer for your own mistake?  Last weekend we came at 8:20 Pm , twenty minutes after happy hour started.....restaurant was packed with just couple of seats still available, some people had starters still .Hostess came immediately and told us that they were very slow and we had 5-7 minutes to order and eat, they wanted to close earlier.... on Thanksgiving weekend? with another at least 6 people who wanted to get in and been rejected for the same reason? We had been told no manager in restaurant right now so we could not get an explanation better than \" Business is too slow with packed restaurant\"  Three of us would spend easily $150 and came back again at least every 3-4 weeks. Well , we are done with this place, doesn't matter if they would be even super great . We have been in many Japanese restaurants and know few with great food and exceptional service . We own few businesses and know how important customer service is . We know that at least 10 people won't be back to this one because of luck of any.  Pretty sad!"}
{"text":"Usually enjoy this cozy, neighborhood sushi bistro delivers great service and food,, but, after making a reservation 24 hours in advance for a party of 3 for outdoor sofa seating at 12:45 PM, we were told to wait a while to see what happened and then after ten minutes passed, we turned away with this remark: \"Well, we've had people sitting there since 10:30 this morning and we really don't want to ask them to move....\" They weren't even eating, just sitting. It seems a thoughtful management would have procedures in place to honor the reservation and the other customers as well. As  long time customer, I'm now having my own reservations about returning."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and every time I've been there it's great!  Their happy hour prices are the best, for high-quality sushi it's definitely a solid choice.  In North Phoenix there are a bunch of little holes in the wall for sushi but this place doesn't make you feel like you're going to get food poisoning when you leave.  The Climax Roll is a main staple when I go, it's never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"What a great sushi bar!! I love that it is very casual and the staff is so friendly. Sushi was really good and you absolutely cannot touch the happy hour prices.   I believe I now have a new favorite restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times during happy hour with friends.  We love sitting on the patio when weather permits. We have never had anything that wasn't fresh and delicious.  Even if you think you don't like sushi, you should give it a try.  There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour but the service could use some work. The sushi always tastes great but seems to be quickly made -too quickly- because it falls apart very easily. If you don't mind waiting for a server longer than usual this place is OK."}
{"text":"Place is amazing went here the other day waitress was nice  Food was amazing  My sister and niece loved the food  They even had the Lil practice chop stick plastic piece for my niece to use  Was great"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here. We always go before 7pm to take advantage of their happy hour. I believe they have a reverse happy hour as well later in the day.  The place isn't very big, the atmosphere is that of a small intimate bistro, and they have a very nice patio area. It's the kind of place that's equally well suited for meeting up with friends or for a casual date.  The food is consistantly fresh and delicious. We've never had a bad meal here or had something we wouldn't order again. The happy hour menu has a great selection of sushi, both nigiri and maki, as well as appetizers, and of course beer and sake.  My wife doesn't like sushi. They offer a full menu of traditional Japanese soups and entrees. This place is great even for people who don't like fish.  I have two personal appetizer recommendations, the ribs are amazing as are the potato wrapped shrimp.  The happy hour pricing is fantastic. Every time I get the bill, I'm always a little shocked by how little it is for the amount of food and sake bombers we consumed. It's a great value."}
{"text":"Good food, crappy service. They're open during the in between hours (most sushi places close between 2 and 5) which is the only reason I would ever go there anymore, even so I dread it. The servers are rude and idiotic and it's always a horrible experience going in there."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this location with a co-worker for a bite during lunch.  Always on the lookout for good sushi, we decided to give this place a try.  The results were less than stellar.  We both felt the service lacked somewhat.  Not on the server side, but on the food delivery side.  We both felt the service was sort of slow, despite the restaurant being mostly empty.  I ordered smoked salmon nigiri, seared tuna tataki salad and a baked scallop roll.  The Tuna salad was large, but seemed to be doused in a lot of sauce that was sort of vinegar-like.  It was too much for me.  Additionally, the tuna was brown with visible white connective tissue veins.  I did not finish this dish.    The baked scallop roll was one of the lessor examples of the dish I have had.  Using what appeared to be regular US-style mayo, straight, and little, if any additives made for a roll that any untrained person could execute at home without any flair or problem.  On the flip side, the smoked salmon nigiri was tasty and well portioned.  I also ordered a desert I had never heard of, tempura or deep fried cheese cake.  This peaked my interest and I explored.  Once delivered, it dawned on me that I was looking at a close cousin of a churro drizzled with chocolate sauce and whipped cream (see a photo I have posted).  It was initially tasty, but lost its attractiveness as I consumed more.  It's high sweetness load, combined with the outer \"fried\" layer made for a bad finish.  This is a desert that would probably appeal more to children at a party.  Overall, not my best sushi experience, but not my worst.  Since I always believe that everyone has a bad day, I will keep this one on my second chance list."}
{"text":"The reverse happy hour here is amazing. Sushi is alway fresh, servers and chefs are friendly and amazing, and the flavored sake is fantastic. In the happy hour they have full size rolls for $4 & $5 dollars, specials on drinks, fast service. The also have fresh wasabi if you ask for it for $2. If you have never had real wasabi (green paste is not wasabi it's horseradish with coloring) then definitely ask for it."}
{"text":"Found this place last Thursday and was so impressed I went yet again today. I tried the \"sweet thang roll\" which was tasty as well as the coconut shrimp appetizer. I can already see myself coming here more often since its close to my one and work. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I moved down here from Cali a yeah ago and I know sushi. This place makes some of the best sushi I've had since I moved out here great place"}
{"text":"WARNING THIS PLACE MADE ME SICK!!!!! Sushi came warm and the fish was not fresh. After eating a few pieces of sushi I felt like I was going to vomit and had to go to the washroom. Called to complain, the manager pretty much told me to F!@# off. DON'T EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to Sushi restaurant. The service is excellent, great atmosphere and the food is Amazing. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and a sushi place that is actually open when I want sushi. Highly reccomend!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, the most horrible service that I've ever had. If you're ok with sitting an entire meal with 5 waiters and waitresses glancing at your empty cups (4 of them) and never once asking if refills were needed let alone if the meal was ok, come here. I've recommended this place to a few people and I'm not so sure I did them a service. I am so disappointed in this service..."}
{"text":"I live in this area, and have always seen this little joint by the Target and wondered about it. When a girlfriend at work wanted to go for Happy Hour I decided to pick this place- one for its proximity and two, for the fact that their Happy Hour goes until 7 pm. For a workaholic like me, who doesn't ever know if I have to stay late- that's totally a WIN.   So me and my friend roll into here at the tail end of happy hour and it's pretty busy. Clearly the locals are in the know about the happy hour deals at this place. We wait a little while- not too long, and get seated in our own little booth. There are two sets of menus- the happy hour one, and the regular one. We order off of both and wait for our food to arrive.  First off- cocktails. She got the sangria, I got the Tokyo Tea. Both are great- the Tea is DEFINITELY pretty strong, so be warned. It's apparently their version of Long Islands, with Midori added. Good to know. I lucked out with it being good- the cocktails had no description and so I picked blindly, hoping it would taste decent.   The sushi came out very promptly, and was decent for sushi. Nice portion sizes, fairly fresh. I unfortunately can't remember what exactly we ordered, though.   Interestingly enough, we note after we finish our first plate of sushi that we're missing some. We flag down what I'm pretty sure is the Lady Boss, and she apologizes profusely- and brings back out for us the Happy Hour menu. Even though it's actually AFTER happy hour at this point. I was quite impressed, to be honest. But we tell her no, we had orders on the regular menu, and she brings that out instead, we mark down what we got and reorder again. This had a bit more raw fish- I believe we got the Cherry Blossom roll, and the... white something? My memory fails me, but it had white tuna, and mayo, and was awesome. I also got my standard Ikura nigiri, and that too was okay. It can be too fishy if not fresh, but this was good.   For all the sushi we ate, and the drinks we drank (we got an appetizer AND miso soup as well) it only came up to about $30 a person. Pretty gosh danged decent, given that us two ate enough for 4 people. So definitely worth a stop in, and for me- repeat visits, if only because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Tried to order food. Never showed up. After 2 hours we canceled the order. They just kept lying, telling us it was on the way. Horrible waste of time."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay. Nothing special and a decent price. Service is not great  though. Delivery is very hit or miss . We live 10 minutes away and it consistently takes between 1.5-2 hours. A few times they have called to say that the driver is stuck in traffic.... how?  Twice, we called to check the status of our order and they will say the same thing \"traffic\".  Delivery men are rude.  Sushi is not worth the service"}
{"text":"First time dining here and I noticed first, place was full...Good Sign! Our server was friendly and courteous. Couldn't beat the reverse happy hour prices from 8 to close. Ordered a few rolls off of that menu. Ordered a couple more off of regular menu. Favorite was the \"First Love\" roll. Very tasty with good acidity. We'll be back to try more rolls! Oh Sopporro's were $2, a plus!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place with great prices! Check out everyday happy hour before 7pm everyday!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi you'll get on the North side of Phoenix. Tonight I ordered to-go from this new restaurant, and I chose 3 different rolls, the lion king, the baked scallop roll, and the caterpillar, in order to sample some items. All of the sushi was delicious. I normally go for the raw rolls or nigiri when I order sushi, but the baked rolls at this restaurant were outstanding. I highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone in the North Phoenix area...delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi of 2015 award goes to....sushi style!!! So little fish on rolls that my fish-obsessed cat did not notice I was eating fish. Honestly, the slices of fish were the diameter of a quarter and paper thin. Also, the rolls were supposed to have avocado, but the amount of avocado was the smallest I have ever seen. Gyoza were raw. Nothing was very tasty and there were extra sauces on things (to cover up the poor quality?). So disappointed and feeling like I was taken advantage of- I may as well have lit my money on fire and watched it burn.   Be forewarned and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place. Everything we've ever had here is freaking awesome. I'm from California, so I'm used to outstanding sushi... this is the only place I've found in Arizona that compares. Great staff, great service, outstanding sushi."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place! Happy hour and reverse happy hour make it very affordable! The hour in the evening not covered by happy hour is from 7-8 I believe. I love the Spicy Tuna Roll. The fish is fresh and the last time we were in we had the best server! She was cheerful, smiles easily, brought out food out fast, and was very attentive without being obtrusive. There is plenty of parking, outdoor seating, and a full bar."}
{"text":"Living in Southern California, I've had some pretty good sushi. Though, while on a recent vacation to Phoenix, my boyfriend and I were craving sushi! I was a bit skeptical of having sushi in the middle of the desert, but the reviews this place had received seemed promising. Once we arrived, we were shocked at how cheap the rolls were! We happened to come during happy hour, and were pleased with the selection and prices. We ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll and the Godzilla roll and were in sushi heaven! We even loved the Godzilla roll so much that we had to ask for a second roll of it because it was that great. Our waitress Taylor was awesome and super nice, which made our experience better (because who doesn't love great service?) After we finished our rolls, I decided to order the deep fried ice cream, and I'm glad I did. It was hands down the best deep fried ice cream I've ever had. Overall, if you're in the area, you're lucky! Stop by if you're in the mood for some great and inexpensive sushi. I wish we had a Sushi Style out here in Southern California!"}
{"text":"The fish is very fresh. The sushi chef's are very knowledgeable and personable. They also have a killer happy hour including different rolls and sake bombs. My girlfriend and I do sushi night once a week and we don't usually venture away from this place. If you are not into the raw stuff they have amazing fully cooked dishes as well."}
{"text":"Great place. Good sushi, nice and clean, friendly staff, an all around good time. So happy to have a sushi place so close by. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Ordered a 48 piece veggie set, and a 8 piece cucumber roll. What I received was a 48 piece set without the cucumber roll I paid for. After being on the phone with them for 15 minutes of them arguing it, saying their menu was wrong. The 48 piece set is actually a 40 piece set and the cucumber rolls i ordered are in there, that's why there are 48 pieces. Would not refund my money for the extra set I didn't receive, didn't care nor understand the issue, and said it was my fault. Ridiculous. After fighting forever with them, they finally gave me the cucumber roll I paid for.... except it wasn't cucumber rolls at all. It was rice unravelled with cucumber pieces all over the place. I'm sure the chef obviously saw that the pieces weren't rolled!??!  I'm not even talking a bit of spillage here, i'm saying all 8 rolls weren't rolls at all. It was a container of rice and cucumber. Absolutely ridiculous. Will never go back, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm- the end of the happy hour which is from 4-7pm.  We ordered crab puffs, 4 happy hour rolls and a sake sangria.  A few minutes after the server took our menus he informed us they were out of crab puffs.  We said that's fine and did not order a different item to replace it. The sangria took about 5 minutes but was ok when it arrived- not too sweet.  Very drinkable.  We got 2 if our 4 rolls out after 30 minutes.  The Las Vegas roll is typically one of my favorites but this one was room temperature and the tempura was slightly soggy.  The Philly roll was typical.  Our second 2 rolls came out after we ate the first two.  The crunchy crab and spicy tuna were both just ok.  Something really small that I did notice was the nori seaweed wrapper seemed chewy-er than I've ever noticed before.   All in all- I didn't hate it but they don't even have to cook the food!  It should come out quicker then that!"}
{"text":"Despite other yelper reviews, I came here wanting to try the sushi burrito, as a takeout item.  The young lady was very friendly but I was surprised at how slow the service was, considering the restaurant was half empty.  I ordered the sumo burrito (Salmon,tempura shrimp,crab,cucumber,avocado,mixed lettuce,cheese,spicy mayo, fish egg ,eel sauce) - it was overly sauced and too lettucy.  It could be that i just don't like sushi burritos (ie:  no over sauced rice rolls, imitation crab and lettuce in my roll).  But in general, I caught myself wishing that I had opted for something else.  This was a skip for me."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is the best! I got two rolls and sak for under $20!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for the happy hour specials a saturday afternoon and gotta say we were less than impressed with the first visit. The server took almost an hour just to take our order and the food came out in weird stages, but the drinks were cheap and the sushi was good so we decided to give them a second chance. On our subsequent visits the servers were very attentive and the food was great so I'm giving them five stars and counting the first visit as a fluke."}
{"text":"Visited for first time during their happy hour.  Tried some stuff on happy hour and off.  I like my sushi and avoid most rolls.  The Nigiri was good.  Tuna was a little pbland but the salmon, yellow tail and snapper made up for it.  Great deals on their happy hour (4p-7p every day) -  a Big Beer and Big  Hot sakes are $6.    Service was prompt and friendly.  Love the reusable Sushi Menus!  My asks - close Monday and open Sunday.  Put some cold sake on Happy Hour.  Will be back"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  Terrible service.  Waited outside in the patio for 15 minutes and no one came out to greet us or give us water or take our order.  There were plenty of employees standing at the bar talking to each other and watching tv.  We left.  Terrible service.  We come here a lot because it's 4 miles from the house.  But with terrible service like this we won't come back.  You shouldn't treat your customers like this. There were not many customers either so that wasn't the problem.   I will not be coming back. You have lost a costumer."}
{"text":"I have admit that I can be a high maintenance customer! But my waitperson ALWAYS indulges me and takes great care of me. It's especially fun to sit at the bar and watch Kevin's effortless genius. Getting special items off menu makes me feel really spoiled. By far my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. Several are closer to my home and work, but it's worth it to go a little bit out of my way for this treat."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's right next to my friend's place so is very convenient. The server was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Lindsey is the best server I've ever had here and was very kind and considerate to our needs. We had a great time here. It's all because Lindsey and her great service. She made the the night :)"}
{"text":"My last experience wasn't pleasant. However, today was much different.  My service was good and the food was great. One thing I must say is that the food (sushi) is consistently good."}
{"text":"I'm in heaven!!! I had been searching for a great sushi place for awhile now, something that was close to home, and boy did I land the mother load. The pricing is awesome, happy hour even better. Great variety to select from. They even have Jalapeno rolls...my ultimate favorite. They are spicy and hot, so if you like that, you have to try them. Taylor was our waitress. Super friendly, efficient and offered awesome service. They even have Green Tea Ice Cream, outstanding. Keep up the good service and food Sushi Style...you have a patron for life!"}
{"text":"Based on the food and the alcohol, this place deserves at least 4-5 stars. The sushi was great, and the sake and beer was everything you can assume it would be. However, the waitress we had was the downfall. Very forgetful, had to continuously ask her and remind her for things. And as she wasn't old enough, she had to ask other servers to bring our drinks which extended our wait for those. Despite the constant wait, it was a overall pretty good experience. Maybe the girl was just having a bad night."}
{"text":"This place has great lunch specials! I've been a few times with my friend and we've gotten a ridiculous amount of sushi, miso, an appetizer, and tea for about $15 each. The service can be a little slow, but the sushi is tasty and you can't beat the lunch prices."}
{"text":"Definitely found our new sushi spot. Drove 40 minutes here from a recommendation from a friend and it was worth the drive.  For an appetizer we started with the calamari which was amazing. Perfectly crispy and served with a spicy and a sweet sauce. Both sauces were soooo delicious.  We ordered the tuna and yellowtail shashimi which I was told it was the best shashimi they have tasted and was so fresh and didn't taste fishy. (I don't eat that but my table did)  We also ordered the crunchy roll that was on the happy hour menu which was really good.  Last we ordered the Climax Roll (my favorite), Guilty Pleasure, and the Baked Lobster Roll. The guilty pleasure has Hawaiian white tuna on top which I wasn't a huge fan of but the roll was still pretty good and my table loved it. The baked lobster roll was amazing and had a ton of lobster on top.  The service was just okay, but the sushi made up for it. It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday night and we had to keep asking our server for more water but he was still nice, just could have been more attentive.  Happy Hour is from 2-7 then 8-close everyday so that was a plus!  I definitely recommended and we will be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come to this place because of the sushi burrito and left feeling very satisfied. It was a pretty good portion, almost like a foot long sub, that fills you right up! I recommend the shrimp tempura burrito! The only bad part was the presentation, it was very messy and hard to eat, and the atmosphere of the restaurant! Otherwise, a yummy meal that I would have again!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good, but the salad and miso soup fall short in taste. I have gotten more for less at other places. Just an ok place to eat."}
{"text":"Always a great place to relax and enjoy fresh, perfectly made sushi. Great outdoor tables, aways top notch service. Choices, oh....the choices!"}
{"text":"Came here on a last min. right turn and I'm so glad I did, all the rolls we had were delicious and everything was so fresh. Chili garlic edamame is where it's at. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here for the first time. She had a tempura dinner and I had shrimp tempura for an appetizer and chicken yakasobi for a entire! All was yummy and well presented! We will be BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I've been hunting for my favorite sushi in Phoenix and is easily the best, most affordable sushi. Newton is the best server ever. Just don't come between 7-8 because that's the only time they don't have a happy hour!"}
{"text":"We ordered the sushi lunch special $6.95 for  two rolls (we got salmon and yellowtail) a red dragon roll, and a soft shell crab, hot tea, miso soup, and a lemonade. The total was $34.55. I would recommend the crab but not for the price (7.00) it was VERY SMALL. The soup was just warm not hot but good. The tea was good and hot but they did not have any tea cups and they served it in saki cups. The salmon was good and the red dragon roll was good. The rice on all the sushi was very sticky and just slightly hard :("}
{"text":"My sister and I went for Happy Hour around 5:30. We were afraid that it might be busy because it was happy hour, but it wasn't bad - plus the restaurant is a decent size with patio seating. We were sat right away.   The waitress was really nice and attentive. Our order didn't take too long to come out, and everything came out at once. The HH prices are great. Also, I enjoyed the fact that their spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy because of a spicy mayo, rather the mix itself was spiced. The only thing neither my sister or I liked much was the spicy tuna appetizer - I forget the name. The base of it is like a rice hash brown (deep fried rice ball), and I don't think it added much besides sticking to my teeth haha. Besides that, +1 for the HH experience."}
{"text":"Been here several times with friends. LOVE it. Not outrageously priced for sushi. Even when packed, great, fast and friendly service. One of our favorite sushi spots in town!"}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday lunch. Only 2 other tables were occupied.  No hostess to greet us until serveral minutes after we entered. She did not ask if we have been there before or if we had questions on the menu. From the time the 1st order of our group was delivered to the last order, it was over 35 minutes. The waitress said there was a huge backup in the kitchen. \"A huge backup with 4 patrons and two already served?\" The waitress asked if there was anything she could get for us implying to the group she would take care of it. She brought out two edemame which she charged us for.  The person whose birthday we are celebrating got there meal second too last. It was awkward because no one wanted to eat out of respect until everyone got served. I am never coming back. Great job, that's 7 customers you'll never see again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour prices are great! $3 large sake?!  Love it. Ordered a Tootsie Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll, both were just okay, but I LOVED how fresh the wasabi was. Service was great - the right amount of attentiveness, but also left enough time for a full conversation without being interrupted. Cleanly. Relaxed atmosphere with seating inside and outside. My mom swears this is one of the best new sushi places on the north side. No wifi :("}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI RESTAURANT IN TORONTO. The wait time is so long, service is crap and sushi is mediocre.  Ordered takeout and waited 45 minutes for my order to be completed. The Asian owner inside not once said sorry for waiting 45 minutes and was extremely rude.  The food is awful and tastes like poor quality sushi. I am so disappointed and I hope no one will encounter this. I wonder how this place is still open with this type of food & service.   I will never come back again.  Don't waste your money here, there's 20 more sushi restaurants nearby with better sushi and service !!!  Awful awful awful experience!"}
{"text":"So my wife loves sushi, and we found this location. Service was on point and quick, Lindsey took great care of us, so friendly and nice. Definitely highly recommend and will be back soon."}
{"text":"-1 star because they are slower than plate tectonics, but everything else is great. If you got 1.5+ hours for lunch, this place rocks. Oh and fresh wasabi for a buck. Like not horseradish and mustard dyed green like 99% of sushi places (though they have that too).   Bacon wrapped scallops are evil in the best possible way as well."}
{"text":"Excellent! The shishito peppers had tremendous flavor, love that they char their edamame rather than just steam it. Could have been as I ordered the spicy garlic edamame. Hubby had the himachi collar and the raw Wasabi octopus, both excellent. I had the amberjack tataki which was yummy! Wait staff and sushi chefs attentive and knowledgeable. Will def return!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is sometimes slow, which is why I gave 4 stars. Happy hour is great..till 7! Gets pretty busy around 630, so try to get in before then. Staff is friendly, but you need to get their attention most of the time to get things. We go back often, so definitely try to go if you are low on funds but want a decent sushi place."}
{"text":"Sushi Style is a good place to go if you want a filling lunch/dinner without sacrificing too much quality. Obviously you're not at a high end sushi place, so you get what you pay for. It's moreso quantity over quality, but its pretty tasty so I'm not complaining.   I usually get the bento boxes for takeout. It includes shrimp and sweet potato tempura, 2 gyozas, some sort of sushi roll of 6, miso soup, salad, and your choice of protein (I get beef or chicken) with rice. They come up around 10 dollars but it's filling for the entire day.   Another choice I would choose if I don't feel like carrying all the takeout boxes is the chicken Katsu don.  It's fried chicken and egg on a bed of rice with a really nice sweet sauce.   I've also ordered the dinner for 2 special with udon noodles, miso soup, salad, green dragon roll and gyozas. It comes up to be about 11 bucks per person but you definitely get a lot of yummy food.   Those would be my recommendations! Ive seen they've upgraded their sushi burrito (it used to be small, unfilling and expensive for what it's worth), but with the sushi burrito highly trending, I may want to try this very soon."}
{"text":"Their sushi is fresh & inventive. They take traditional & give it a sushi style twist...... Hence the name I suppose. Service is always great which I thoroughly appreciate-  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sitting here after a few happy hour rolls and I think I just had the best service I've ever encountered at a restaurant.  All the girls here were absolutely amazing and working their butts off together to make sure everyone was happy in a full restaurant.  Food was great, prices were super fair for HH and service was out of bounds A++++"}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant! The edamame sauce is to die for. The sushi is everything! I can't believe I haven't been here prior to this. Every roll was perfect and the service from our server Sep was amazing! So exceptional."}
{"text":"Happy hour was excellent! Rolls were delicious. The salmon was a little fishy than the other sushi places I went.  I had great service and the sushi chef came by and made a bird out of the chop stick paper"}
{"text":"I love this place & I love their happy hour. This is our go to spot for my aunt and I. Whether we're eating inside or outside or just getting takeout, the service is always fast and amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly, the sushi was AWESOME. And the prices are really good too, I've never been to a place with such a broad happy hour! We had about 8 rolls and didn't pay more than $45. The place was quaint, pretty relaxing. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the service. There were 2 servers (that weren't our server) that walked around and were pretty friendly and offered to take some of our plates and refilled our water. The young man who greeted us at the door was kind of rude and seemed like our presence was an inconvenience to him. He was rude at the table, and interrupted me when I was trying to inform him I had a severe food allergy. Overall the sushi was awesome! And I'll be back for that reason, I just hope I don't get that server next time, or he has a better attitude."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they've opened and I will always go back, but to the bar top.  The servers are friendly and always make me feel like I'm a \"usual\".  The sushi is good, but my only complaint is that there are a lot of items that are covered in eel sauce.    The first time we went here the service was mediocre, the food was ok, and the wait was horrible.  I also didn't like that we got the food out all at the same time instead of as it was ready.  A little weird for a sushi place.   I gave it another shot because it's very close to my house and was very pleased with my second visit.  It's nice to have a moderately priced, decent sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi styles a various times, where The food has been delicious, and mouthwatering. In addition, the service is great, the staff are friendly and nice. However, the negative to this is, if you order a appetizer in addition to your main entree, you have no time to eat your appetizer, your food comes within 5 mins after your appetizer is there."}
{"text":"Pretty decent little joint.  The staff was very pleasant as we came for a round of sake bombers ($5) and a few rolls during their reverse happy hour which starts at 8!   Even though the venue is small they have a nice environment and the food was very good.   I will definitely be returning to this sushi bar for their delicious sushi rolls and happy hour menu,"}
{"text":"Bleh.  The seaweed they used in the sushi was chewy and gross.  I had to take it out it was so unappetizing.  I would not go back for sushi.  The restaurant smelled weird too... Like floral cleaner.  It wasn't too inviting.  I'll stick with going to Sushi Kee where the Sushi is done right and it is always amazing."}
{"text":"My server zack was so amazing! Although he was new he was still on top of things while serving other people. The sushi was so yummy! 100% coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Not the best in town, but we will definitely be going often to the happy hour as it is very close.   The salmon was delicious melted on my tongue. The Philly roll was probably one of the best I've had at any of these west side sushi places, even better than Yen. Yen has asparagus in it which makes it weird. They have cucumber AND avocado. Any Philly roll fans would say that's a little piece of heaven.   Very clean inside and staff is attentive"}
{"text":"Best happy hour prices ever! Had 2 Las vegas rolls for $5 each and a cali crunch for $3 I think. This place was jam packed Friday night but they moved everyone along quickly and didn't make us feel like we had to leave as soon as we finished. Very nice servers too!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. I've been looking for a place that has gray sushi and service close to home. I've finally found it!!! highly recommend. Brittney was awesome to us!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the sushirrito for a while now and just had to try it when I found out this place serves it. Definitely disappointed though, the portion of fish inside the roll was small and it wasn't fresh. They also put some REALLY spicy ginger and wasabi inside the roll. The asparagus was fried tempura style but it was hard and just did not taste good. The roll fell apart after 2 bites and was just a huge mess. Still on the hunt for a delicious sushirrito :("}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh fish, cold drinks and a great happy hour. Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"We just had an absolutely inedible meal, completely destroyed by Foodora's rider, and probably past due before it was even sent.    Unreal - Foodora and Sushi Style combined for the worst meal I've ever had the displeasure of paying for.  Sushi that's been sitting all day prepackaged, and then smashed up  inside the boxes.  We had to throw it out - absolutely inedible. I still can't get the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Try minkeybrain. Do not order takeout, they will mess up your order. Service is ok, reasonable price. Best thing about this place is sitting outside."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Food was reasonably priced and delicious. Large menu with unique rolls. Very friendly staff that was happy to customize rolls too."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are here every week sometimes twice a week I have a sushi addiction! I love this place tasty sashimi and love the two piece sushi and how could I forget the sake bombers! Happy hour is great for our wallets! And the manager there, Kako, is such a sweet lady! Thank you Sushi Style!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery service from this place many times and I haven't had any major issues! This isn't five-star sushi - this is your typical quick and easy Downtown Toronto sushi joint. It's not gonna blow your mind, but will definitely satisfy a sushi craving!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and yummy sushi! The service was very friendly and quick. They have a large selection of food and rolls so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was stellar, thanks to our very considerate waiter. All of the rolls were delicious, except the Lovers roll. It was so weird and packed with mayo that I couldn't eat it. The spider roll and Las Vegas roll were excellent, and my chocolate martini was just right. However, my date and I ended up feeling ill after our meal, so I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place! We recently moved from San Diego and needed to find a new local sushi joint. We went for happy hour and the rolls were very reasonably priced and delish! I love sushi and have tried many places and I was impressed by this place. Server was so friendly and efficient, refilling our drinks constantly. They also passed out a dish \"on the house\" to all the tables for us to try, which was nice. Looks like we found our new local sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour !!! great prices and the quality of the fish you get for this prices is very good !!! we had like  8 rolls dont really remember the name but they all were good plus miso soup which was pretty good too. their happy hour sake bomb is a great deal !!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted by friendly faces. We were seated promptly and the menus and water were brought over. We went for lunch and they have a great priced lunch menu where you can choose two or three rolls, which we ordered. The sushi was very fresh and tasted delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try other rolls."}
{"text":"We went back for a second time, Weds night 6pm during happy hour.  Place was more crowded this time, which we see as a good thing because we want it to succeed....BUT....they really need to work on their service model.  There are no bussers or hosts, and only two wait staff who, I hate to say, are not the most experienced or efficient.  We watched about three parties come in, look around, stand there, and then turn around and leave.  They were never acknowledged by staff.   There were tables available but they weren't bussed, so having a busser or at least an extra server would help them keep the flow going and not make a bad first impression on walk-ins!  We still like this place, glad it's here, but they have some kinks to work out service-wise.  Not well-oiled."}
{"text":"Great sushi at very reasonable prices!  They also have a pretty good happy hour until 7pm, which includes $6 saki bombs (and a very generous amount of saki)!  My friend and I didn't order sushi off the happy hour menu, but instead ordered the sushi combo for 2 for $35 which was a nice assortment of rolls, sashimi and nigiri, mixed tempura, and miso soup and salad for each of us.  Lots of food at a great price!  Love that there is a good sushi spot in the neighborhood now!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Amazing service!! Wonderful atmosphere!!!! The prices are good as well, we will be back every time we venture south from Prescott. Annnd the music is awesome.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place used to be SO good - what happened!?!  When I first moved to the area 18 months ago this place was amazing.  But the last four times I've been here have been really bad...and I mean really bad.  Have you ever gotten a bone in your salmon nigiri?!  Neither have I in 25 years of regular sushi consumption but guess what, it happened here last time I was there.  It's so disappointing because the location is great for me but I've had to take my biz to Nori in desert ridge even though I hate desert ridge, I hate bad sushi more..."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time tonight. Sushi was not very good. They were mostly all rice--I didn't enjoy anything except the seaweed salad. Service was pretty bad too."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Style me and my boys eat there all the time. I love their spicy crab rolls and shrimp tempura rolls. The staff is very pleasant and the bar is really nice."}
{"text":"Neighborhood sushi. The food is really good, tempura shrimp and ribs are great. Great happy hour. I gave it 4 stars because service sometimes is not 100%. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house and I love it. They have great hh prices and specials and reverse hh from 8-10. The menu is simple and delicious and well worth the prices. The edamame is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Not too crowded, clean and festively decorated for Halloween. Wonderful lunch specials. Today I had a Bento Box which included soup, salad, teriyaki chicken, a spicy tuna roll, edamame, and a side of rice all for $8. I was so full after this delicious lunch! Will go back often!"}
{"text":"Took my son this evening for HH. It was good. We had Philly, Tootsie, and baked scallop rolls. Service was friendly but slow getting my credit card back with sign slip. Bring a sweater if you get cold easily. I was freezing by the time we left."}
{"text":"Turns out i had been driving from north Phoenix to north Scottsdale, a 20 min drive and paying way to much for a roll that I loved, until today. I asks for them to make me a golden California roll with eel sauce, spicy mayo and sriracha, just like the one I had been getting in Scottsdale. They made it even better for half the price and I was spared a drive. Yay sushi style! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here several times as it is a convenient location for me for a la carte sushi   Pros:  - good selection of sushi, ranging from sushi burritos, bento boxes, sashimi plates  - sashimi tastes good for the price  - waitstaff are nice (not exceptional service)   Cons:  - lunch specials are advertised as \"specials\" but does not come in a filling portion ($7-8, see my attached photo) - bubble tea tastes overly sweet; they use powdered flavouring to make their fruit flavoured bbt (don't expect fresh fruit) - sushi burritos range from $7 to $10, but small in size  - small space; not ideal for large groups"}
{"text":"Finally, a sushi place in moon valley with not only AMAZING sushi, but also an amazing atmosphere and friendly staff! If you love sushi, please check them out. They also have their liquor license, which a few in the area do not. Clean and beautifully set up. I am certain that I will be coming here every week. They have a very wide variety of sushi and other menu items. Their sister store fresh wasabi has had obvious success as well, they definitely know what they're doing! Also, great happy hour offers!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is on point. Good environment and great servers. Also every time i come here i get goose bumps from the crunchy roll when it hits my taste buds. Overall 5 star sushi."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was such good sushi near me! Tried sushi style out because I honestly was too tired to cook and the happy hour was great. Stopped by with a friend and sat outside. Great weather and good ambiance. The drinks and service were good for it being busy."}
{"text":"We love Kevin the sushi chef and his delicious scallops... Tuna lover rolls and spicy tuna hand rolls! Yum"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food, good ambiance. $8 for perfectly grilled salmon, 8 piece spicy crab roll, edamame, veggies, and white rice for the best bento box ever! An added bonus - their beer was super cold!   I'm never in this area except for getting an oil change and it was really a great find!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday evening because I was passing by and it looked decent. I got a box with chicken teriyaki, California rolls, gyoza and a couple of other things and I enjoyed them all. The price was excellent for the amount of food they included with the meal. They were very friendly and I would definitely stop again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Great little stop with a welcoming vibe, energetic atmosphere, and solid food.  The sushi meshi had a subtle flavor, served at body temperature; just right when so many fail.  The fish was properly aged and was of good quality, veggies were fresh and crisp.  The food did not knock my socks off, but I'd come back again as they are doing it right."}
{"text":"We ordered for Miso Chicken Soup and shrimp fried rice.  Both were true to its taste ..   Service was fast and the hostess was really helping with smile and care !  loved it .. will surely try this place again !   Thanks"}
{"text":"I've been coming here every week since I've moved to Toronto 3 years ago, until I went in last week and saw a dirty open box of meat just sitting on the floor. Their floors are not only disgusting but the uncovered meat was in a cardboard box with holes it in. See ya!!!!"}
{"text":"For having such great reviews I was really expecting more from this place. We had the Las Vegas Rolls the spicy Tuna roll and California rolls. The Las Vegas rolls tasted battery and were luke warm for made to order food! It's like they had been sitting out or pre -made. We also tried the beef yakasoba noodles, to sum them up they tasted like a TV dinner. Overall I was not impressed, The waiter appear to be stones and after asking us a question would stare at us for several seconds after we responded. Will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab some sushi, when you get there ask for Lindsay, cute little blonde server, just don't ask for a happy ending"}
{"text":"I hardly write reviews. This was the first time I ate sushi and was absolutely hooked ! Spicy crab roll is so far my favorite. lots more to try though and a very good reverse HH !"}
{"text":"Sushi style is a pretty cool place.  Nice patio to sit on during the shoulder season.  Went with the family and sat out there.  Good fish.  but...the hot tip is to sit at the sushi bar, on the far left side, and let the chef who works that station (younger guy - forgot his name) surprise you - he does some really great stuff!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an inexpensive drink option, you can get both a saki and beer combo for under $5.00.    Sushi was okay; not great, but not terrible.  Cucumber salad was sweet and I prefer more vinegar.  Service leaves a lot to be desired.  I have dined twice.  On both occasions, waited to get drinks, refills, and anything you may need after initial meal delivery.  Service is slow.  We sent a dish back this time and the server was pleasant and voided the cost of that dish.  We ended up getting something different and it was just okay!  One last note, where I'm from, they don't include wasabi in the sushi but instead only offer it on the side.  This place actually puts wasabi in the rice and or sushi ( we confirmed this with the waiter since I had never seen this done).  If you don't like wasabi, ask for them to leave it off the dish!"}
{"text":"Good sushi- it was the service details that will make it hard to come back again. Out of one of the things we ordered (charged for it on the bill)- we didn't get half of them! We didn't get the 2 orders of cucumber salad we ordered...  And they were out of the shrimp shumai. So we ate 3 rolls and that was it. Bummer we never got to eat the other 3 items we ordered- even though they tried to charge us for them!"}
{"text":"My friend and I the other day decided to try this place since it's one of the only places that has sushi burritos in Toronto. We were expecting lots but the burritos were very disappointing. My friend got a spicy california burrito and I got the shrimp tempura burrito. Nothing seemed fresh, quite sloppy and it was quite pricey for the portion and quality. However, it was pretty decent customer service and our order was very quick. We got take-out, but inside the restaurant looks very clean and organized."}
{"text":"Good sushi!!!! Very good happy hour menu. Took my friend here last night for her birthday and our server was awful. She didn't know how to take a drink order, she rushed us and my salmon nigiri was really tough and chewy (no problem, happens sometimes) and she wasn't going to take it off of the bill until my friend asked her. We felt totally felt like we were bothering her. She had absolutely no knowledge of the menu and was all around rude. There was a male server working who was massaging female server's shoulders ect...we are 2 servers ourselves, previously at sushi bars too. The only reason I rated 3 was because our server made the experience sub par."}
{"text":"Website menu doesn't even show the sushi selection, makes it very difficult to order via phone not knowing the menu... door dash menu also has zero sushi options in it so can't order online either... fix your website and update your delivery menu for door dash... also was on hold for over 20 mins, that's pretty ridiculous too!!"}
{"text":"Sushi style gets 4 stars because there are unique sushi items, always high quality fresh fish and VALUE!  I've been to happy hour here 5 or 6 times and cant wait to go back.  You have to give the Hawaiian white tuna a try.  I really can't say there is anything about this restaurant that should keep anyone from trying it.  If I was to criticize anything, it would be that it is in a strip mall shopping center (like most restaurants in AZ) and the bathrooms access is kind of interesting.  But they don't deserve to lose a star for that.  This is one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I finally decided to check this place out. Slowest wait staff ever. Below par sushi, pretty expensive and not worth the agonizing brutal service."}
{"text":"Had the $8 lunch special that included a sushi roll, miso soup, a bento box with chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, edamame and an orange.  It was insane.  There were different choices for the sides.  I give it 4 stars just for the price alone!!"}
{"text":"Love going here for happy hour.  You really can't beat the prices and they have a pretty big selection of sushi to chose from."}
{"text":"Really good Sashimi with delicious rice and thick pieces :)"}
{"text":"As a college aged kid I'm always looking for ways to get more bang for my buck, here you can do just that. I've been here 6 times and at lunch. They have a lunch special that is $8 where you get to choose between a meat, a sushi roll listed and an appetizer. As well as that, there is a small miso soup and salad that comes with it! My favorite meat that the offer in this deal is the salmon! The food is really fantastic and never disappoints but the service does. Every time I've been (6 times) the service is terrible and they wait until your glass is almost empty to refill it, lunch is a busy time and the lobby is full and they only have two servers. The decorations are wonderful and well thought out, there is an option to sit at the sushi bar which is cool. I come back for the lunch deal each time- I guess I can wait a long time for my food- I'm a patient person."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food for a great price! If I ever want sushi this is usually where I go due to it being so close to home.  Their bento box lunch special is amazing! It's $8 and you get so much food!! An orange, miso soup, a salad, some sushi, and a protein choice! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  The sushi is so good and it's fairly priced.  I think the our server was having an off day yesterday because the service was slow.  He's usually on top of it.  He's really good at what he does. Ialways get the Las Vegas rolls which were delicious and AppleTini which are also delicious.  We of course will be back!  I forgot to take pictures of the food but got some pictures of the menus."}
{"text":"Very casual, fast paced sushi restaurant. Friendly service and fantastic sushi & sashimi. No regrets!"}
{"text":"California crunch, Vegas , volcano, Philly and a shrimp tempura roll. The rolls were delicious. Service was a little slow when we first arrived but our waiter made it worth our while...Thank you Alex"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews and things were very good. Our waitress was friendly and fast. We had the gyoza, cucumber salad, seaweed salad, and the following rolls, climax, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, spicy crab. There is reverse happy hour from 8 to close and it's definitely a deal.  The food and service was good and fast. I would return here in future visits."}
{"text":"Went last night based on favorable reviews. Ordered the special Tuna Tartar and got a tuna Salad. Then Specifically said do not bring the Tartar... Guess what brought that as well.. Truly a language barrier the rolls did not tasted right and my Tuna Sashimi was dry and fell apart as I picked it up."}
{"text":"After visiting Sushi Style for the first time a couple of weeks ago I will not go back.  Food is way over priced for what you get, and there are tons of other sushi restaurants with far better quality ingredients.  Ordered a chicken yakisoba dish and a couple of kinds of sushi rolls. Unfortunately frozen store bought yakisoba tastes better than what is served here... The sushi was presented well but didnt taste fresh and tasted as though it had been sitting on a counter for a while."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town!! And the prices are right in the middle. I don't usally eat here..I just find it to be crowed and not a very relaxing atmosphere but the food is AMAZING! I usally order take out..the salmon nigiri is a classic must try at sushi style!"}
{"text":"Not really good sushi or service.  Skin was left on yellow tail sashimi, the salmon was warm and the place had a fish smell.  Should have left at the fish smell from the start because the more upscale sushi places do not have this problem.  I do not think they know what they are doing and they allow customers to be too loud.  Staff should be able to politely remind clients they are not the only ones in the restaurant when this happens or they should remove the booze from the table as a hint.  Lunch time should not suffer these problems.  The price discount for the shoddy fish, atmosphere and service was not equal.  Rather eat the sushi at much more expensive place or out of dumpster and avoid this place altogether as my other options."}
{"text":"Good sushi for Arizona, especially in the North Phoenix area. Prices a pretty fair. Definitely get the salmon nigiri or sashimi."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi for a fraction of what you would expect to pay. Great happy hour specials on sushi rolls and excellent service!"}
{"text":"The sushi is always good  They have a crazy good Chili edamame  The best edamame I have had The out side is dirty and not welcoming  The place is in the most empty and the still work extra slow  They messed up my order 2 times  The serve me sushi with lemon and the Rhine was on it  They need to upgrade this place ASAP  They serve was nice after all that's why the 3 starts"}
{"text":"The sushi is decent but we used to come here cause it was cheap. They raised the prices recently on the plates but the quality of the sushi didn't make an equal jump. Not bad overall but I would rather get better quality at these prices"}
{"text":"I love this place. I probably went there around 20 times so far. It's a great spot for first dates ;P Their Happy Hour is great and it's definitely my first pick for sushi in Phoenix. Service is super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews were pretty strong and consistent, so I decided to stop in when I was in the area.   Very fresh, perfect amount of wasabi in the rolls, happy hour pricing. Nice place! Loved the iced green tea as well. It's weird how some places either don't have it or its some cloyingly sweet fountain drink.   Seriously fresh, fresh, fresh, tuna!   Service was very courteous as well. Overall great experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I recently visited sushi style. While this was not our first time here, we hadn't had good experiences with the service in the past. I gave sushi style 2 stars because the sushi was not bad, but not great either. The service and attitude of some staff members was horrendous! Our waitress didn't seem to know the answer to anything we asked about on the menu. I ordered my son noodles with chicken. He dropped a few noodles on the floor while eating. (sidenote: I always wipe up under the table when my kids make a mess at restaurants.) The sushi chef then goes on his break, walking right past me, stops to look at our table in disgust, shaking his head and muttering under his breath \"unbelievable.\" I have seen adults make bigger messes! We were still eating our meal. This sushi chef was rude and nasty!! I am not bringing my family back here again."}
{"text":"Had an affordable dinner at this tasty sushi place with a couple of friends. All three of us were drinking, had an appetizer, a couple of rolls, and some nigiri. Only $75 and it was all delicious! Happy hour and reverse happy hour available, and I do like to be happy!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the sushi is always great! The wait to be seated is longer than usual in the evenings but totally worth it! I was very disappointed with our server when my family and I went there for dinner two nights ago. He was very rude, checked on us one time just to get us refills that we had been waiting for, for approximately 10 minutes. My boyfriend would ask him a question and he would walk away as he was answering, maybe Alex was just having a bad day. Regardless, we will always come back because the sushi is delicious! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff! The waitress we had was all over our table making sure we were well taken care of! HAPYY HOUR Sushi is awesome!"}
{"text":"Waitress was great and made great suggestions...sushi was good...sake bombs were good...can't ask for much more"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place. Reverse happy hour is where it's at!! Volcano roll!!! SOOO yummy!! I would give the service 4 stars....good, but there are a couple servers that are not the greatest...but the sushi is some of the best I've found in all of greater Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time as a student for cheap bento boxes and great service to boot. But apparently the nice cashier doesnt work here anymore cause the new one just laughed out loud cause my card got declined once. She gave me the dirtiest look from the moment i walked in and just generally looked like she hated my presence. Get a new front-woman please"}
{"text":"Love this sushi joint! Always friendly, fast, SUPER affordable and very good sushi! I highly recommend this restaurant and love that I live so close by!"}
{"text":"This place has a great Happy Hour menu with good food and prices! The Teriyaki beef ribs are a must try, very tender.   Service is always quick and friendly. We've visited with our family 3 times and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Food was good for the Valley's standards, however I have experienced better. Our server \"Young\" had a comment for every request we made and gave us not so helpful answers. I asked about how sweet/dry was the house sake and she replied \"It's sake. Sake is Sake. It has no flavor\". After that I asked about what exactly was in one of their happy hour drinks and she replied \"It is a cocktail drink. It has alcohol in it.\". - Really?? I would like to give this place a higher rating, specially since it's so close to my house, however due to it's poor service I'm forced to give a 2-star rating.  I will have to continue looking for a good sushi place that is close to my house. SIGH..."}
{"text":"Great! Their happy hour prices are very reasonable, and the $3 salmon nigiri was delicious! Plus- they had a lot of \"cooked\" sushi options for my mother who is scared of raw fish.  Silly mom."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. The happy hour prices are very reasonable and you are always greeted and served with a smile, which can be hard to find anymore. The selection is quite vast, but is wasted on my wife and I as we always order the sashimi (tuna and salmon) as well as a role or two. We do try new roles, but we love our sashimi ;-). We frequent this establishment regularly, although not as often as my wife would like. Hahaha."}
{"text":"Great surprise in the hood , no more driving to Scottsdale , tried several rolls , all well prepared , and happy hour 4-7 and 8-10 ., I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not good... Prices are outrageous and quality is below par. I got a basic salad, spicy tuna and some other roll (forgettable). All I remember was the lettuce was brown and wilted on the inside. I was like \"really\"? I dropped over $20.00."}
{"text":"I usually don't give 5 stars to a place I've been to once but sushi style is an exception.   They have a great selection of sushi rolls, sashimi and ramen noodle bowls. All at very reasonable prices.  Oh! & they have Sapporo on draft for $5.   Our server was really nice and took great care of us during our first time there.   Try the monkey brains, too!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. The sushi is good. We had 4 different rolls and some Gyoza for lunch. There were around 7 tables including us, and only one waitress, but we never waited longer than we would have anywhere else."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé frequent this place at least once a week or once every other week. We moved to the area and wanted to find a sushi restaurant. We tried other places and they were okay or just plain bad, but here is amazing! The staff is friendly and the sushi is fresh! If you can get a spot at the bar, do so! 10/5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The staff asked if it was our first time there (which it was) and hooked us up with a free signature roll.  For being so far from the ocean, this place was good.  I enjoyed it.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We regularly buy from this sushi place. While normally are in and out by grabbing Togo, today we decided to dine in and it was a pretty good visit.  Crab puffs are on point with the sweet chili sauce. Pretty typical. We had numerous rolls and a couple ichibans and life was good.  Service was a little ho-hum and lifeless but didn't really matter too much."}
{"text":"Pretty decent prices and fast service. I ordered a sushi burrito once and it was pretty good (not amazingly good but good nonetheless). It's a good place to come and stop by if you're on the go and super hungry."}
{"text":"Taste like the sushi you get at a Chinese Buffet.  The salmon roll tasted a little fishy, nasty.  The red snapper roll was decent.  The spicy tuna roll was decent as well. All in all, buffet quality sushi.  Prices are very cheap during reverse happy hour so I can't complain too much. Staff is nice and friendly.  It felt really boring in there.  I wish they would play some music.  Not the best ambiance for a date.   I am used to very good and extremely fresh sushi but I often pay a higher price for it.  You won't find that here."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times withy girlfriend, always great good and great service, presentation is awesome, fresh, great sushi, have not had anything bad, love the rolls and the variety"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. Jalapeño poppers. Love them, great with the sake bombers!!  Korean ribs are delicious!! Love this place!! Wait staff very helpful with the menu!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers on lunch break. Service was fantastic, gave us plenty of time to order, eat and cash out within 45 minutes. The food I had was fantastic, I got a bento box lunch special with salmon, cream cheese rangoons, california roll, miso soup, salad and rice for just EIGHT DOLLARS! I love me a good deal. The sushi roll was great, but granted it was just a california roll. 4 stars for now, will definitely be back to try the other sushi rolls then will update the rating."}
{"text":"Food was great! This our second time coming to this location. The only reason we are giving 2 stars is because of the happy hour and great sushi! They deserve a 1 star this time because my mother-in-law got rice and took a bite only to have a toothpick in the rice! When we told the manager, he was uncaring! He looked at it, took it away and later came back and said \"do you want me to just take it off or get a new one\"? You would expect a little compassion especially since it could have cause a lot of damage!"}
{"text":"5 stars!  Excellent service!  Great rolls!  Played just Timberlake and Danity Kane!  I really love sushi and I really love 00s hip-hop."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week now. Great bentos. So much more than just sushi. Really great for the whole family or a night out with friends. Sometimes I pop in for just a quick drink and bite before I head home. Amazing atmosphere. I used to live in New York and loved my local sushi place. Honestly happy hour is a steal. I've never had bad service and the manager is all over the place making sure everyone is happy. Awesome location. Super clean inside and out. Really can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This hidden gem might be our new favorite spot. Their happy hour sushi prices are a great deal and my husband said it was really good too (I don't eat that stuff lol)!! The ramen wasn't anything spectacular but the pieces of pork that came in it were amazing, and whatever you do, make sure you try the Chili Garlic Edamame. You will not be disappointed :) Service was great, our waitress was very nice and friendly. We will definitely be back and soon!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the ribs - delicious fall off the bone and it's on the Happy Hour menu special. Try the Cherry Blossom. Every roll is on point.  This place has enough staff to take care of everyone. Fast service, Happy Hour till 7pm, and Sushi is good quality.  I will come back on my next visit to Phoenix.   H2Oh!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, since it's a branch off of Fresh Wasabi in Glendale (which has great food). Went here for Happy hour and got seated right away. We ordered from the HH menu - two Raspberry Teas (their version of a Long Island with raspberry flavor), calamari, and four sushi rolls.   Calamari was chewy and had no flavor, teas were a little weird but strong and effective, and rolls were small and mostly consisted of rice. Oh, and they left the cream cheese out of our Philly Roll! That was a first for us.   All in all, we were pretty disappointed with Sushi Style, and would probably not come back :/"}
{"text":"Was recommended by my cousin to try this place and it did not disappoint! I'm not thee biggest sushi lover (I don't eat raw sushi just the cooked, lame stuff) but my husband loves all the flashy colors and raw fish. This place pleased both of us, we ordered the booty booty, the Vegas, the crazy horse and the bell roll . All were delicious but surprisingly my favorite was the bell roll which had one little piece of raw fish (that I didn't notice in the picture when ordering) it was really fresh and delicious ! Our server , the big Hawaiian-esque guy with a low man bun, Newton, was hilarious and very entertaining with his witty banter and sarcastic remarks. Will definitely come back here to enjoy the food and the servers !"}
{"text":"I am writing this follow up for one reason.  I have gone back...tons of times and never again has there been any conflict to be seen.  The food is still amazing and it's still my go to place when I eat sushi.  When I move next month, it will be hard to leave this gem behind!"}
{"text":"Tried a sushi burrito for the first time and was happy with my choice.  Not as good as regular sushi but pretty cool dish.  Not a bad price also."}
{"text":"A good little sushi spot. The happy hour menu gives a good number of options that are decently priced. The sake sangria isnt too sweet, and doesnt take away from the sushi we had.    The sushi options, the cucumber salad, and the tempura ice cream were all very good and definitely made fresh to order.     Likely to check them out more often."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I've found my new favorite sushi place! The happy hour deals are great. $1.00 for a good-sized bowl of miso soup.   We received excellent customer service from our waitress (I think her name was Rachael), the hostess, and even the sushi chef came out to make sure that he understood our very complicated order. He was very nice and didn't try to make me guilty about all of the substitutions I asked for in my roll.   Our food was served quickly and our waitress was attentive, friendly and welcoming.   I will definitely be back and would highly recommend trying out Sushi Style."}
{"text":"Found our new sushi place! The California roll is really mayonnaise-forward which I do not like, but every other sushi roll we had was fantastic. You get 8 pieces of the rolls and they're smaller so you don't have to fight to fit them in your mouth. This is true for most specialty rolls as well. The eel sauce is quite good (I'm partial to this as my sushi condiment of choice). And they have red bean ice cream, which makes me super happy."}
{"text":"Only go here for happy hour with family.   The saki sangria is delicious and a good happy hour drink.  I started off with the cucumber salad and it was great.  I love the sweet vinaigrette dressing that they put on there.  Between the three of us we normally split 4 rolls.  Crunchy shrimp is my favorite!  Tootsie and salmon sushi-mi are great too!  The service this past time was great, before we have had some bad service but that's because of the servers age and culture I am sure.  If you want great happy hour sushi check this place out.  Our bill is never over $40!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Plain White T's - Hey There Delilah)  Hey there, Sushi Style What's up with your Sashimi? I'm a couple miles away But boy, tonight I feel so hungry Yes I do  No Sushi joint can shine as bright as you I swear it's true  Hey there, Sushi Style Don't you worry about the distance I'm right there if you get new ingredients Give this song another listen Close your eyes Listen to my voice, it's my review I'm Bo Bites Hi!  Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me What you do to me   Sushi in Style!  I can appreciate anything in style!  I'm no sushi connoisseur, but when it comes to good eats I'm your man!  I came here on a whim one day for lunch.  Apparently it was the wrong day according to one of the sushi masters Kevin.  Fresh and new ingredients on Thursday & Friday.    Needless to say, I trudged on to order starting with the Opaleye nigiri since they were out of Geoduck....my favorite.  Then with some Tuna Tartar, raw Octopus with wasabi sauce, and bacon wrapped scallops.  The Opaleye nigiri was pretty good, but I still had my mind on Geoduck (get past it already....right!).  My favorite of the day is probably the Tuna Tartar and raw Octopus.  The tuna was meshed with some caviar and rested on a fried wonton shell while drizzled with what appears to be a mayo/wasabi aioli (I could be wrong about the sauce).  Once you get past that it is raw, the Octopus has the consistency of a pickle with a jerky-like chewiness.  The wasabi sauce gave it a slight kick while the welcoming sesame oil really brought out an aromatic punch and taste.  I didn't really care for the bacon wrapped scallop since it didn't mix well with what I ordered I guess.    Overall, a solid sushi place and totally nice spot for a happy hour gathering.  Good prices and the layout seemed like it could carry and good after hour vibe with a nice outdoor patio.  Kevin and James, the two sushi masters were welcoming and informed me well about the ingredients.  Service was somewhat slow unless you sit at the bar. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there with a guy pal during happy hour, and was pleasantly surprised.   We had the salmon and tuna nigiri and spicy tuna roll.   The prices for the nigiri are really reasonably priced.   The fish is fresh and firm, the rice not dried out and hard.  We tried some of the happy hour drinks.   Not to my taste.  Too sweet.   I don't like my drinks that sweet.  The restaurant is tucked into a shopping center, and it was full during the time we were there.   It gets quite a crowd.  Especially for what we get, I would definitely return.   It's a great happy hour nigiri choice."}
{"text":"Good sushi, decent prices and happy hour, good service!  I tried this place out just one so far and it was good!!  Godzilla was good.  Loved the baked scallop roll."}
{"text":"What a great sushi establishment.  A very close friend of mine and I would always treat ourselves at least once a week here with the best they have to offer.  A nice welcoming atmosphere where the customer service is very friendly."}
{"text":"The fish isn't the highest grade around but the stuff they serve is fresh and nicely proportioned.  Prices are more than reasonable and happy hour is a pretty good deal.  Nice casual place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"In terms of happy hour prices and quality, this place is top notch. They have a great variety of rolls on the menu, it was actually a bit overwhelming but what was nice is that the menu had details and photos which not all sushi places have. The fish was fresh and the service was good. I would like to come back and try more things."}
{"text":"I come to this complex a lot and have probably walked by Sushi style 100s of times!  I finally decided to pop in for lunch, and am I glad I did!  Prices are great and the sushi is amazing!  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Calamari tender not rubbery at all, sushi fresh, service was quick and friendly. You should try it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and like the sushi style (no pun intended ) restaurant and cool sushi bar! Nice lunch menu , hot sake , and the chef was super courteous (like the accent)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Their happy hour is awesome, the staff is friendly and the food has always been delicious. I lived around the corner and would always walk and now I live 15-20 minutes away and still find myself coming here a couple times a month because the sushi is awesome and the prices cannot be beat. Sushi style is the only reason I wish I still lived at my old place!"}
{"text":"Sushi style has the outward appearance of another stripmall restaurant; however, their food certainly does NOT adhere to that judgement. My wife and I love getting the Hamachi Kama as an appetizer. It's the jaw of a yellow fin tuna and is super tasty and comes with a ponzu dipping sauce. You'll find yourself exploring the bone to try and find more fish! They have a large selection of different sushi rolls and our favorite is the soft shell crab. The prices are definitely fair. They serve alcohol as well which is also not bad on your wallet. Sake bombs with a 24 oz import will run you about 9 bucks. Beyond the sushi you can also get some other dishes. I have had the yakisoba noodles a few times but wouldn't recommend for everybody as they can be very salty. Overall always a great place to eat, so much so that you may find yourself waiting 15-20 minutes during peak hours but it's worth the wait as there isn't a better place close by."}
{"text":"5 of us came for happy hour and to celebrate another birthday!  The wait was only 15 mins.  We were seated and greeted by our server quickly.  It is a cute place and super friendly service.  I got the gyoza (6pcs deep fried japanese style pot sticker).  They were ok, a little bland.  Must be eaten with soy sauce.  Got the Tonkotsu ramen (pork broth based ramen noodle with soup).  It was bland too.  Loved the place and service.  I would like to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"My spot every Wednesday! Love there rolls! Service could be better... They always forget details, but they work hard, sometimes seems like one server for entire resteraunt..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times and overall their bento boxes are very good. A great source of variety. The only thing that sometimes can get bothersome is the noise level and how crowded it gets in there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in last night and the service was absolutely amazing.  Kam was our server and she was attentive and friendly that we will most definitely return to see her alone.  Now on to the good stuff...The food was delicious and.  We had the eel roll and the toro sashimi special, The Toro portions were huge, it is rare to see the good stuff get portioned as such.  We also had the skewer appetizers, the bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp, and asparagus.  The skewers were smaller for appetizers so sharing 3 for two people was appropriately sized.  I would recommend this place to anyone and it was a perfect spot for date night.  It is very reasonably priced and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"We have taken our staff  times for lunch here in the last 2 weeks.  Everything we have  had is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I would say this is your everyday, run of the mill sushi joint; nothing great but not terrible.   My friend and I each ordered the $9 lunch combo, plus an order of tamago (egg) and one additional roll (Chimichanga roll I believe). The combos came with Miso soup and a salad; the soup was very good and the salad was average.  The combo we each ordered came with 16 pieces of Spicy Tuna roll, 16 pieces of California roll, and a piece each of shrimp, salmon, tuna, and yellow tail.  The four pieces of fish were very tasty, but the California roll was fishy tasting and the Spicy Tuna was bland and tiresome after about 5 or 6 pieces.  The other roll we ordered separately was also conceptually a good idea but unfortunately a bit bland.  Finally the egg, which is something I order at every Japanese restaurant I go to, was tasty but had a very weird consistency I have never encountered.  Honestly, it was mainly the soup and the wonderful, friendly, attentive staff that earned this joint a 3.  If you are looking for good service and a good atmosphere this is a decent place to go."}
{"text":"This place is special. Great signature rolls!!! Not pretentious. Fresh wasabi available."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi with a good ambiance that is also low-key compared to Scottsdale.  Service was fast and the sushi was fresh and cold. They also have a good beer and wine selection plus a full bar."}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for 6 months and just recently decided try it. I am kicking myself for not going sooner.   My fiancé and I go in and are seated almost right away. We got there around 8pm so the reverse happy hour had just started. I should mention that happy hour is from 3-7 and reverse happy hour is from 8-close. This is part of what makes this place so awesome. We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops, crab puffs, 2 Miso soups, edamame, a golden California roll w/cream cheese, and my fiancé got the teriyaki chicken. On top of that we were suggested to try the potato wrapped shrimp, and we obliged.   All of this cost us around $30. BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS. I don't think I have to say anything else about that? The crab puffs were some of the best I've ever had. The roll was delicious, of course, and was drizzled in a very tasty eel sauce. Now, to the potato wrapped shrimp. Holy (insert obscenity here). When I think shrimp, I don't think of it wrapped in crispy fried potatoes. Now I dream of it. WOW. I wanted to stand up and clap for the chef. Probably the best thing we ate there.   This place is amazing if you like nice little sushi bars with awesome happy hour/appetizers. If you've considered trying this place but are on the fence, don't wait like I did. Go. Now!!! ....or when they're open."}
{"text":"This is a decent reverse HH! I mean where else can you get two Coors Lights, miso souo, a Philly role and a Vegas roll for under $20?! The sushi here is delicious and flavorful. So fresh and tasty. The staff is also very attentive and on point to paint attention to your needs. For a strip mall sushi spot, they got it going on!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot. It mostly for to go dinner. Tonight was great. Shout out to Kevin for the new experience. Kobe beef cooked on Himalayan salt block and watermelon with goat cheese! Wonderful.... while waiting for my to go order!!!"}
{"text":"Handy location  Great happy hour, is a regular for us. Well priced when you love to eat sushi on a regular basis"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi Place. I really like the fact that they dont feel the need to place that krab stick in all there rolls. Perfect Happy Hour prices and all my fave rolls are on it. :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and it has a great look inside and always has fresh food. It also has a nice patio and  I have personally seen the kitchen and it is very clean, no problems. I would recommend eating here to everyone."}
{"text":"Lindsay took GREEEAT care of us!!!!! The staff is as good as it comes!  Absolute best \"hidden\" sushi spot in Phoenix. Amazing staff and the freshest sushi you can find. Better than any chain, by far. My husband loves the music and sports that are always on."}
{"text":"Never again.  Long strands of hair in my roll.  Sushi is usually made with bare hands...  If something as long and obvious as hair makes it in, what else is getting in the rolls?  Nope.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in North Phoenix! If you like sushi in a small bar setting come down and see Kevin, and the gang at Sushi Style. I've been to nearly every sushi restaurant in the valley. And this is by far my favorite. Great atmosphere and value! You can't go wrong with Sushi Style!"}
{"text":"My Wife finally talked me into trying a new sushi place that's super close to our home...Sushi Style did not disappoint.   Our server, Danny, was awesome. Very friendly, personable, and helpful with menu questions.   The food here was also excellent. I'm a big fan of ahi and salmon. All of their fish was very tasty and well prepared. I'm not a fan of yellow tail, but it's included on their rainbow row and it completely changed my opinion of it.   My Wife and I will definitely be back. On a side note, the prices are great especially for the size of their rolls. Happy hour 3-7 and reverse happy hour 8-close..can't beat it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner. Had a chicken teriyaki bento, and wasn't a fan. Chicken was fatty, with watery sauce that just tasted like black pepper and the tempura was soggy, with shrimp that had not been deveined. Not for me"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and was seated right away. The environment is nice... clean and intimate. They even have outdoor patio seating available. Our waiter Alex came right over and was very pleasant and efficient. It is hard to find good service so I always appreciate when I do! The food was delicious and fresh! You can't beat the prices! So happy to have a quality sushi place in the neighborhood that provides great service, great food and good times! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every since moving to AZ I have been in search of a good sushi spot and this is it! Great sushi, attentive staff, and amazing happy hour. I have and will continue to recommend Sushi Style to my friends."}
{"text":"Simply some of the best sushi I have ever had.  We have had many items on the menu and they are all fresh and tasty.  Try the alaska and the amigo roll, they're great"}
{"text":"Good sushi.  Executive suite was my favorite. Sushi I've ever had, outside of Japan itself."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Sushi Style for the first time this past Tuesday for Happy Hour with the hubby. We loved it so much that we went back last night for reverse happy hour!! The hubby is rather new to sushi but really enjoyed the cream puffs,philly rolls and spicy tuna rolls. This is a good place to go if you are an experienced sushi go-er or if you are a beginner. We also enjoyed the full bar. He had 3 saki-bombers and I had a rather strong martini ;) Stop in and ask for Alex. Prices outside of happy hour aren't bad either."}
{"text":"What a great little Sushi spot! Prices are great and the flavor is even better.   Passed by this spot a few times and decided to finally give it a try this past Saturday. I came around 12:30 pm. I thought it might be busy and would have to wait, but surprisingly it only had a few other families eating there.   As I entered I was very pleasantly surprised at how updated and well furnished the restaurant was. I was half expecting to see old decor and old original tables, chairs, and booths, but everything looked updated. I liked how this place didn't seem cluttered with too much wall decor or \"Asian\" statues or nick nacks. All empty tables were cleaned and nicely set. Floors were clean as well.   The weird thing for me though was the fact that none of the workers that I saw there were of any Asian descent. They were all white Americans! But the hostess and my waitress were pleasant enough. My waitress could have been more friendly. She seemed like she didn't really care to be working that day.   Now for the food.  I ordered a California roll which cost $4.50. It was the freshest California roll that I have ever had! I would come here again just for that. I also got the Shoyu Ramen which cost $8. They gave me a large portion, enough to share as I only was able to eat maybe half of it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, the liquid was well flavored, and the other items in the soup were just the perfect amount. Another item I would suggest if you enjoy Ramen soups."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it. They have a huge selection on sushi. The spicy edamame was sooo good i ordered another one to take home. Loved the cucumber salad however, the Tootsie roll was my favorite. Excellent service our server was super sweet and friendly he made sure we were happy. Will definitely come back real soon."}
{"text":"Sushi Style has a decent happy hour after 8 pm. I've gone here twice and both times they had good service. The sushi is really good. Tonight I had the Golden California Roll and the Vegas Roll. They have a variety of options on their menu. The music they play creates a great atmosphere and the patio is nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is delicious and the service is excellent:) they bring your food out within 10 minutes every time"}
{"text":"Had really good sushi and a wide range of sake and Japanese beer choices. Happy Hour prices are not great, but they do have it everyday."}
{"text":"Lets start by saying that i have eaten at many different sushi  places in Toronto and this one i woild sat is my least favorite. 1) the quality of fish are not fresh + the quality if the rolls. They do not take pride in appearance at all where u can easily notice that they opened this restaurant  just because they see sushi places are popular but forgot to hire good staff and spend a bit more on the food quality itself.  2) customer service is below par. The girl behind the cash is just there for a cheque and i already told u about the giys making the food. 3)over priced foe the level of quality.  Ive said this b4 and ill stand by it. Not being racist again my kind but you want good sushi, from experience, goto places that are owned ans run by korean or japenese workers. In Toronto at least what i see."}
{"text":"I recently went there for lunch to enjoy their shasheme.  It took them 10 minutes to ask me for my order. When I asked the waitress what the fresh catch was she said she couldn't tell me. She didn't know so she asked the manager who came to my table and rudely told me that she was unable to provide me with what they're offering other than the high caloric rolls that they serve. She got upset with me when I asked her how can I find out what they had to sell and she walked away from me mumbling to herself. Needless to say I did not stay around. It's too bad, excellent quality but served with a major attitude. Who needs it."}
{"text":"Gave 10% discount for cash orders the waiter was very nice and the food is very filling!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi , edamame was the best I've had .. Hard to explain but the beans popped right out , juicy and just enough salt .. Clean cool atmosphere . The reason for 3 stars is the EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE ... About 40 minutes to get the sushi , we were literally sitting there bored with our hands on our cheeks .. (Not busy either).  Scared to order dessert (fearing we'd wait another 30 mins) but we did and waited for 15 minutes for a scoop of ice cream.  If your starving or on a time schedule I would not come here .. But if you have time to spare its worth a try."}
{"text":"Food was alright, service was horrid not sure if she had a problem with serving us but coming from someone who works in food business I was not impressed. We observed her being way nicer to other guests and also she acted as if anything we wanted was an inconvenience. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"HAHAHA,  the place is exactly what i thought. I wanted to try this because hey...i want to give all new places a shot before passing judgement.  When we went in no one sat us down for 5 minutes, but it was completely empty...finally a hostess came sat us down and then didn't bring us any menus...I was fed up so i got up and grabbed menus myself from the hostess stand.  Just by looking at the place i knew it wasn't going to be good. The salmon was warm slimmy and rubbery...yeah three traits your \"fresh\" seafood should never be..guess what happened 4 hours later...I will spare you the details and let your imagine play.  Anyways, pretty typical poor quality sushi place, with inflated prices. They don't even use real crab for their quality roles.   Whatever gets the suckers to come in and spend money thats fine..  won't be back...second chance has been revoked for this place"}
{"text":"To correct one of the top reviews/tips, happy hour is from 4-7, and reverse happy hour is 8-close."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for a good sushi restaurant but always end up at one about 20 minutes from the house. It's my birthday today and a work night so we didnt want to drive too far so I looked at Yelp and we decided to go here tonight. Well, no need to drive so far anymore because Sushi Style is about 5 minutes away and some of the best sushi we've had! We got the sashimi sampler which was so fresh and flavorful. We also had the Vegas roll, shrimp and salmon sushi ($12.50 for the 3 with happy hour!!!) school bus roll, climax roll, and the untouchable roll. SO amazing! They have a kids menu with a ton of options for the kiddos - my kids, 5 and 8, loved their chicken and beef teriyaki bowls. They have a huge menu, a bar, good music, inside and outside dining, and friendly staff. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the wait staff is nice despite how slammed they get during happy hour. I'd go nuts having to work that hard but they always seem to pull it off! My son and I frequent their happy hour for a regular dad/son dinner date. He's a picky eater and loves Sushi Style... That says a lot in my book. I love the variety of rolls but always enjoy the spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Nice size rolls and a large selection of rolls to choose from! Great service :)."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!! And even better prices!!! We always are very happy with the food here, I would consider us regulars! The only downfall is the customer service, the past few times I've been they seem to be short staffed causing the servers and hostess to all be rude. Last time we waited 20 minutes to be seated when they had 8 open tables. Obviously I've never run a restaurant so I don't know the logistics.... but this doesn't add up to me. Moral of the story, service sucks but the food is great so I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We have sushi here 2-4x per month, always during their late happy hour that starts at 8pm. The dragon roll is awesome as is their soup. $4 for a huge Kirin is a good deal as are the rest of their happy hour prices. Tonight the servers were a little late getting to us so they gave us 10% off without us even asking or complaining! :)"}
{"text":"Great experience. Loved the rolls we ordered and the prices were reasonable  and our waiter was attentive but not overly involved. All in all wonderful place."}
{"text":"My husbands and mine favorite sushi place! Right down the street from our house...they have great sushi at even better prices! Their happy hour is awesome!! Servers are also always really nice and accommodating, once we showed up late and they all stayed late and didn't rush us at all with our dinner which was actually really nice of them!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and delicious food!!  Defiantly will be my sushi spot!   Got to enjoy some amazing sushi with my niece!"}
{"text":"Good little sushi place. We missed reverse happy hour by about 20 minutes and will be going back to try during this time. Sushi was fresh and pieces were very reasonable size and came with 10 pieces in each roll!"}
{"text":"The service here was terrible.  My husband and I came in for dinner and ordered 3 rolls and 2 bowls of ramen.  After receiving the first two rolls, the food stopped coming.  We checked with our servers and they forgot to put the rest of the order in!  It took another 20 minutes to make the ramen.    After we finally got the ramen, we checked again on the last sushi roll with multiple servers, who reassured us that it was just a different kitchen and would come out soon.  It never came out.  The servers never even checked to see if the order was in.  The food was OK, but the service was just terrible.  I've eaten at roadside hot dog stands with better service."}
{"text":"This place is very close to home and a quick place to treat my sushi cravings at time. The prices on their menu is very affordable. However, quality of food and service, I have definitely had way better Japanese food. This place is actually Chinese run Japanese place, for those that are interested in this tidbit of information.  I don't know why, but they cut their sashimi really, really thick so you can't really eat it in one bite. Don't get me wrong, I like my sashimi, but they just cut their fish way too thickly. D and I have been here twice (I think), and I have to say their Sushi and Sashimi Dinner combo for two people is at a really good value.  So if you are in the mood for sushi and don't want to pay too much, this place is good but don't expect the same level of quality and service at a high price point sushi place."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since the last time I came here in regards to service.  The food quality is still good, however there are plenty of other places where you can get good quality of food and service! The staff is on the younger side, most likely high school students. Our server was nice, but she didn't write down our order and then forgot one of our dishes.  Also, as we were sitting there waiting for the check we were asked multiple times if we needed help.. I realized they had a wait and lack of tables so I could tell they were waiting for us to leave. One girls in particular that was not our server kept clearing our table and asked us to hand her our drinks before we were finished with them.  Having worked in the service industry I completely understand the pressure of putting guests on a wait. But to pressure your current guests to leave is going to make the business bad.  I won't come back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact I worked in sushi for 4 years... This review is for the food not the service. I got two rolls for roughly $18 and they were so small. The soft shell crab aka spider roll tasted burnt. There was only a small amount of rice on the roll as well. The rolls were bland with not much going besides the sweet unagi sauce flavor. On top of this they don't have any special sashimi dishes tuna tar tar or bbq albacore which is my favorite. I'm super disappointed because this place had pretty good ratings. Maybe the sushi in Cali is just better"}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is slow, and I've had much better.I go here sometimes, but it's definitely not my first choice."}
{"text":"Normally this is my go to for takeout but after tonight, I might have to find a new place. I was on hold for 15 minutes before I hung up. The food is good but the service is going downhill."}
{"text":"This is a review that will be updated after a second visit.  The first review:   After a few months since opening, the atmosphere was chill, laid back, and easy going. We walk in, and within a few minutes, we are seated and given our menu's and options of available drinks.  Drinks came briskly and promptly, I have to say, my drink was alright, maybe a bit far too much liquor being as it was a mixed martini.  The Appetizers, Miso, Cucumber salad (I was craving Seaweed Salad, however they were out) The Miso as  expected, was delicious. However it was lacking the much needed ingredients for a perfect broth. The salad was beyond depressing for my tastes. Bland, almost entirely too sweet, something def to pick at western tastes, had a bit of crunch due to sesame seeds. The slices themselves were thin, too thin, and were wilted, soggy and again bland. Little vinegar, but more sugar.  The Main Course: Spicy Tuna, Spicy Eel Roll, Slices of Tuna & Salmon Sashimi, Two Eel Pieces.  The meal is expected of a new hip joint for sushi & sashimi. I will say I enjoyed it, however the much needed moisture and air when eating sushi, should always have a crisp, and sumptuous flavour of the fish itself. This was a bit lacking due to the need for almost everything we got came with sauces. (On & Off to the side) The rice was almost way too dry to truly enjoy thoroughly. Some of the slices of eel were to me shrunken or seemed to me, they shrunk in size, think of the moisture being sucked out of a piece of meat. The tuna & spicy eel was similar, but they were both tasty and suited my craving for some fish that day. The slices of sashimi were thick, not too thick, but may change due to price as well as the availability of said species. Plenty of Daikon, heaps of it. The two eel pieces, they are supposed to be dripping with flavour, I was sorely disappointed with this one, they were dry, lacking in eel sauce, barely a spoonful was laid upon it.  The Service: Our overall service at the time was very mixed, we kept getting the wrong dishes, they'd send us over someone else's order, and they seemed as if they never actually wrote down our order which really put my pal & I off. Our overall waiter was incredibly nice, I think they started a week ago at the time, but that is no excuse not to write down and order, be it our waiter or someone else's. In total, we had 4 times a mix up of orders occurred. We were given a complimentary dish of fried fish skin with 3 types of sauces on it, not even on the side. I touched nothing, and my partner only ate 1-2 of the 7-8 slices we were given. It was beyond mediocre.  Overall I will be visiting this place again to see if anything has updated since then, and hope that this time I can give them a full 5 stars. However if you want an actual home style sushi experience, I recommend HaNa Sushi. A mom & pop place as well as an eatery that will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Server did refill our water but never cleared a plate (we sat at the bar and space was super tight). We found ourselves strategically stacking out used plates to make room.   Sushi was ok.  I've always lived on the coast so this was my first \"inland\" sushi experience.  There seemed to be a focus on deep fried rolls and rolls drenched with mayo and other sauces.  Not a fan.  The sushi chefs themselves were very nice and offered assistance should we need it while picking out our rolls.  The fish did not seem super fresh, but definitely hadn't spoiled.  Maybe that's just what you get when you live hundreds of miles away from the ocean? The restaurant appeared clean and it was quite busy for a Wednesday evening.  They do have a Happy Hour here and there are quite a few drinks and rolls you can select between 4-10 bucks.  Had to track the server down for our check and it was another 15 minutes before it was brought to where we were sitting.  I did like the Vegas roll which is on the Happy Hour menu and my friend had the Coffee Mochi which was very nicely presented.  She said it was delicious."}
{"text":"I can't really think of anything to say about this place.  It was dull.  I stopped in because I switched work locations again, and craving a veggie roll hard.  I ordered to go.  Miso soup- Bland, it was eh. Decent portion, just not really anything that I'd purchase again.  I gave the specifications of what I wanted which was veggie tempura roll, they were out of broccoli which was :(.  The roll came apart, the rice rolled on the inside which I'm not a big fan of.  It was kinda a waste of money and I do not plan on coming back.  Oh, and it was really cold in the place."}
{"text":"This review was really hard to write. I really liked the vibe of Sushi Style and everyone was pretty friendly, I'll give it another shot a little further from closing time I suppose. Here goes.. My Bf and I walked in around 8:30PM on Friday night and it was pretty packed, we waited a full 15 minutes for a table and we're sat at a small 2-person table along the wall next to the restrooms. At first the service was great (although we weren't offered water which was odd), we ordered a seaweed salad, a cucumber salad and received those fairly quickly. The salads were good and simple as expected(reverse happy hour menu). We then ordered a large sake bomb and shared it. Still no water. After the salads, we ordered a few rolls(a tootsie, a vegas and a California). I specifically asked for all rolls to be sent with soy paper and only 2/3 had soy paper. I hate sending food back so we just ate as is. The rolls were pretty decent, pretty small but I figured they were small since they were on the reverse happy hour menu so no points docked for the size. We ordered a second tootsie also, tootsie was the best of the three.  Anyway.. after we receive our third roll our server disappeared. I wanted to ask for a couple glasses of water and another beer for so long but I didn't see her so I bugged someone else and they brought them to me. By this time it was almost 10PM and we wanted to leave but didn't have our bill. After asking someone else for our server they brought our tab for her, we paid and poof! She appeared! She snatched the payment so quickly and vanished. During this time there was another server helping to clean up our table and she spilled soy sauce all over my boyfriends brand new phone, his wallet and his movado watch. I was so upset but we just wiped everything, signed the receipt and left. They apologized and giggled and left. It was just a disaster toward the end because the customer service went straight out the window. All they were concerned about was getting out of work it seemed. Anyway.. we will probably be back but not close to closing time. :/"}
{"text":"Our second visit to this place. Their sushi is good and tastes fresh which is definitely a plus when ordering raw fish in the desert (Phoenix). We love the patio and the service has been great both times.  Bento boxes are great for lunch. Las Vegas rolls are great anytime."}
{"text":"This place nails it every time! The food, service and prices can't be beat. The fish is always fresh and not that icky dyed frozen stuff! Talk to Kevin at the sushi bar, he's amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for reverse happy hour and had 4 different types of sushi along with their crab ragoons... everything was excellent, we will definitely be back, and on a regular basis. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch! I got the bento box. It was good. Only eight bucks and worth every penny. The teriyaki chicken was really impressive and the salad and soup were great. Tons of food!   The drink cups are minute but service was so good my glass was never empty.  I would be back in a heartbeat to order this again, it was well worth it. The only gripe would be that a huge massive chunk of wasabi was placed/hidden under my teriyaki chicken...I hate wasabi, I=I ate it, almost cried, thought I was going to die, lol."}
{"text":"This place rocks with great music and the best sushi Happy Hour in town! The Happy Hour menu offers more than most when it comes to sushi, rolls,  and drinks! My son took my husband and I for dinner tonight and the three of us ate five sushi rolls, two miso soups, and one cucumber salad with no drinks for $30 plus tip. I enjoyed the Las Vegas roll which was a 1st for me but all their rolls are superb. I know this shows as 1 check in for me here on Yelp, but this was my 3rd or 4th time eating here and it's all fabulous!"}
{"text":"It was fun, cMe here on a whimmmm ok service and sushi. It's the only one around, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here...fish is fresh... we always order the same thing salmon skin rolls, salmon shashimi,  hot sake and a cold beer.... we keep it simple but we have always enjoyed everything we've experienced here!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is close to my home and I've been wanting to try it and finally did.  I was surprised at how good it was.  We had an excellent meal with cucumber salads and several of the sushi offerings off of their happy hour menu and some green iced tea.  All was fresh and tasty.   We had excellent service and will be returning."}
{"text":"Great place! We went for lunch! Decent prices.. Huge menu, menu has lots of options... They have pictures of majority of rolls on menu which is nice with full description.. They have lunch specials that a great prices. Waitresses are very attentive! Close to my house so thats a plus! Will go back again!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has low stars..... They need to improve their menu and start going to other sushi restaurants and makebtheselves more competitive...."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch on a Tuesday. I sat at the bar and the chef was nice and  server was attentive.   The sushi was average nothing extraordinary. Good presentation but average on taste. More of a traditional style with little fusion. I prefer fusion style sushi along with traditional sushimi.   Would I come in again if in passing by and in the mood for sushi perhaps, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Yelp to the rescue again!  This place is great!  Great sushi selection, killer happy hour, excellent service. And the sushi was yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for your local sushi restaurant. Love coming here to get take-out sushi and rangoons. The patio offers great seating when the weather cools off."}
{"text":"The food is good, not the best sushi I've ever had but definitely not questionable. They have a happy hour from 4pm-7pm and then a reverse happy hour from 8- close. The calamari tempura is good and I enjoyed the miso soup. The rolls came out quickly and my table ordered six. They were decent   The real problem I have is the staff. I've come and waited her for my bill for 20 plus minutes. Asked the other staff to bring it and they just said they'd tell our waiter we were ready. Finally one of the other girls brought it. The waiter was not personable. Get like he was at work because someone made him. I get it, we all have bad days but come on dude. He had to be asked to take away empty plates. Tossed most of the food on the table. Didn't even tell us his name.   I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We love this place. Generous portions. Excellent basics like salmon nigiri, love the baked lobster roll--tender, flavorful. Riley was our server tonight and she was excellent,  friendly, professional and attentive. Happy hour til 7 is nice so we can go after work sometimes."}
{"text":"My first sushi experience and it was the BOMB! LOVED the Climax and Las Vegas Rolls. One area of opportunity is waiters and waitresses being more attentive. For a good 20 minutes we hadn't even gotten acknowledged until we flagged a waiter down. Alex was excellent from the time I got in the place. He made the BEST Appletini ever! There was one waitress that was really rude and she almost turned me away from returning but I will give them another try in hopes that service has improved. Looking forward to returning this weekend and I will let you all know about that experience."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Style restaurant for a quick meal. The restaurant is a plain ordinary restaurant that serves food at a reasonable prices. I ordered the chicken fried rice and spicy salmon burrito.  The spicy salmon burrito was pretty good for 8 dollars. It is sort of like a sharama roll, but use seaweed as the wrapping. It was filled with rice and several chunks of salmon. The chicken fried rice was okay.   The people who work in the restaurant were quiet and shy. My waitress didn't say anything until I finished my meal. The service could be more friendly.  Would I go back? Probably since the burrito was  good."}
{"text":"Just a weird experience there.  The food was average or below.  The tempura was soggy and just not good.  Service was ok, People hovering over us the entire night.  I have spent a lot less for sushi for a much better meal.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here with the bestie and her tot and were pleasantly surprised.  We shared edamame and a few rolls- tootsie, salmon, and what I think was called the sunrise roll (Cali roll with salmon and thinly sliced lemon on top), which was super tasty.  Fish was fresh and rice was cooked perfectly with good seasoning.  The servers were also very attentive (maybe a bit too attentive since it was slow, but I guess that's not a bad thing).  We came during lunch and they had a special on certain rolls, 2 for $7.  Good deal! We didn't go too crazy on the raw stuff because my friend is still exploring, but what we had was great.  Even her daughter liked the salmon roll!  Prices are decent and they have a great selection of creative rolls and other Japanese foods for those non-raw fish eaters."}
{"text":"Yummy food and a decent price! Fast service, nice and friendly staff. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food great service really good on happy hour. I would recommend the barbecue ribs I would recommend the jalapeno poppers I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Waitress was super sweet and helpful! She recommended the double climax roll, it was a little pricy yet amazing. For our appetizer we had the baked muscles, which were perfect! Also had the crab claws (they gave two big pieces of meat on each roll) compared to other sushi restaurants we were pretty happy about that! Of course, spicy scallop rolls were amazing too.   We went at a perfect time, because it was pretty empty and we had extremely quick service. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I used to like this place until I got food poisoning the other day (3-9-16).  I can't say for sure if the food poisoning came from Sushi Style or from a previous meal.  I understand this can't always be prevented (especially when preparing a dish with raw fish) and the food poisoning itself is not the reason for the 1 star review - the reason for the review is the way the manager handled my phone call the next day following the single most miserable night of my life.  I started feeling uncomfortable about an hour after my meal.  2-3 hours later I was either on or hugging the toilet the rest of the night.  The manager chuckled when I suggested it may have come from this restaurant \"because food poisoning doesn't happen until 12 hours after a meal.\"  Wrong, it can happen as little as 30 minutes after a meal and almost always occurs within 12 hours.  She tried deflecting any and all blame, didn't take down my information, and almost didn't even ask what I had to eat."}
{"text":"Was so hyped about the sushi burrito, but disappointment. This things like thrown together like a sloppy joe..... They do not care. Its a total mess when opening the packaging sauce is dripping, the salmon is cut poorly, everything is not good.  not worth 8-10$ for a burrito"}
{"text":"Went with friends on a busy Friday night. Every one was friendly. Food was fast. Four of us gorged ourselves on rolls, sashimi , beer, and saki and had a tab under $100."}
{"text":"Not very good I've eaten at many sushi spots at various places throughout phoenix and this was one of the worst it's not that it's terrible tasting or that the service was bad it's just the food was not very good"}
{"text":"This place has a fabulous selection of sushi and I enjoy the openness of the restaurant.  The staff are friendly and are always on top of things.  I highly recommend this place as the sushi is always fresh and appetizing."}
{"text":"After countless excellent experiences, I had to update from 4 stars to 5!  Thank you for the continued excellent service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in North Phoenix that's in cahoots with sushiholic. Happy hour is a great deal, lots of options. The four seasons roll was really good, had salmon, ahi, and yellowtail all rolled into one. Server staff was really nice and attentive. Overall a great spot to drop in after work, chug some Saki and rolls with the quickness and head home. I did see a board of specials so when I head there for dinner I might change my review to 5 stars but for now solid happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I'm not here as often as I used to be, but the food here is A1  so is the service (:  Lindsey-- our server, has always been my mom and I's server and she is phenomenal. Never have I or my mom have had any problems w the food or service. The suggestions she have made as well are  good too. Always gonna come back here (: keep it up, Sushi Style!"}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over the world. Sushi Style is not only the best sushi I've had in the valley, but some of the best sushi I have had on my many travels. Great happy hour, great servers, very reasonable prices,and great sushi chefs! For great sushi I will go no place other than Sushi Style!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet efficient and great happy hour... Super cheap and great food... everyone is really nice and you can't beat a $5 Kirin light"}
{"text":"The sushi here is OK. I would only come here if you want something quick and cheap (lunch special). Not that great to be honest."}
{"text":"Just got delivery from here, and it was super fast and really good! And they gave me extra on the house!   Really good options too, and very nice staff. Love it. Will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered through Tasteaway with a good discount code. The rolls were falling apart, though the rice was well seasoned. The soup was very salty. We got only a few slices of ginger. Not enough for 40 rolls.  The delivery was quick, but here is the problem: The driver harassed us for a tip.   My husband forgot to grab some change on his way down and just as he was going to explain, the driver asks \"can I have a tip?\" Husband comes back up. I decided the man had forfeited his tip. I was getting dressed to go down and speak to him about his rude behaviour and he buzzes us again claiming he thought we weren't coming back. I educated him that especially when you already receive an hourly wage, you shouldn't expect tips. Tips come with good service, not because you shake people down for them. And that you don't press the issue further by essentially begging.  The nerve!"}
{"text":"Quite surprised by the quality of this place. Fresh and flavourful sushi for a reasonable price. Clean and well decorated restaurant and fun presentation of dishes. Bento boxes have the best value, recommend the salmon teriyaki box. Service is above average. Menus with Google images and misspellings are a good laugh while you wait."}
{"text":"Love this place - kevin (chef) serves up his own creations / speciality plates if you ask for it. Daniel is my fav server - she is fantastic. Best sushi in Phx."}
{"text":"My favorite locally owned sushi restaurant! Their bento box during lunch is amazing! It's a huge portion, tastes great and is a great price! The staff has ALWAYS been friendly, even if the service was a little slow. I'll take happy, outgoing servers with slow service any day over rude servers with fast service. They have always been incredibly accommodating when I ask to sit inside with my 90lbs working German shepherd. Anytime I have a lunch meeting I always suggest we go here!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here just about weekly since we found this place last year. I enjoy the salmon sashimi as well as the cucumber salad. The crispy spicy tuna is very tasty with just the right amount of spicy and sweet with the jalapeño slice on top. Yum! The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town. We don't have a good sushi restaurant where we live in Lake Havasu City. Wonderful service wonderful pricing nice patio. Good lunch spot. Very happy to have found sushi restaurant. I highly recommend the restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and great prices during happy hour! The rolls were really good, my favorite was the booty-booty!"}
{"text":"Heard good things from people who have been here and thought I would check it out and as a sushi fanatic I was not impressed at all.  The service was rather slow, the waiter rarely checked in on us and seemed distracted most of the time although the place was not really busy. He would take one order then come back 7 minutes later for the other. Also we waited a good 15 minutes for our check after we all decided to leave some kind of signal we were done by stacking our plates together.  Onto the sushi: most of the sushi was fresh, however the avocados were not ripe enough and were slightly hard. All throughout the dinner, I had this very unusual undertone taste to everything I ate. After several experiments we discovered it was a mixture of the dirty soy sauce bowls and the soy sauce that made everything taste like you were eating a latex balloon.  Between the service, the weird taste and the high priced food ($14 for Beef Yakisoba? It's just ramen with little tidbits of beef!) we figured we can go to Sushi Station near Desert Ridge in the future for a much better meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for dinner after our pedicures. I loooooove sushi, he does not but, he went just for me. When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated. Before we could glance at the menu a separate waitress came and asked us what would we like to drink. We informed her that it was our first time there and we needed more time to look at the menu. It was happy hour for food and drinks and the restaurant had a good amount of patrons outside on the patio and about seven to eight inside not to include my boyfriend and I. I ordered a small hot sake, rainbow sushi roll, two shrimp rolls and tempura calamari. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki and a soda. The salad, miso soup and drinks arrived quickly. The soup was flavorful and so was the salad. Moments later our meals arrived and we dug in.    I noticed my boyfriend become quiet during our meal and seemed upset. We were almost done eating when I notice the calamari hadn't arrived. I waited for the waitress to come by to ask about the appetizer. She said \"Oh, you ordered calamari? Do you still want it? I forgot to put the order in.\" All of this was said in a matter of fact tone. I kept what I wanted to say inside and told her, \"Don't worry about it.\" I was really upset because I really wanted the calamari as going to Pappadeaux's just for fried calamari would never happen (I would've ordered all of my favorites). She said \"ok\" and went to the table to my right. My boyfriend was done and asked for the bill. He promptly paid and we left. Once outside he told me that the table to our right was having an inappropriate conversation about black people and Mexicans. That is what caused his mood to change.    I don't believe that I will be back thanks to the waitress who was so nonchalant about not placing an order and the type of conversation that was overheard. The food was good, but I will try other sushi spots in the area in the future."}
{"text":"The most delicious sushi I have EVER had! We ordered four rolls of sushi and only waited 10 minutes. The environment is nice, modern, and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre sushi at reasonable prices. Service is awful though. Came by for takeout for two vegetarian rolls and waited almost 30 minutes. Was also the only person waiting for a take-out order. There was no explanation for the delay. Service might be better when sitting in but the sushi didn't leave a particularly good impression on me that I'd want to return."}
{"text":"This is not my first lunch at Sushi Style, but it was the first time I decided it should be added to the lunch rotation. The Bento boxes are $8 and include a choice of five proteins(teriyaki or katsu) several varieties of sushi rolls and 2 piece sushi,   and fried appetizers, edamame or salads. Each comes with Iceberg green salad and miso soup + rice and sauteed vegetables underneath the protein entree. I ordered the chicken which was pounded extremely thin and cooked till tender, but lacked flavor. Dining companion had the salmon which was beautifully grilled till the skin was crispy. the cucumber salad was perfectly prepared, crisp tender, slightly sweet,  slightly Tangy. Reports are the seaweed salad was well prepared as well. Service was good, but it was not busy at the early hour when we dined. I do recall on other occasions service was a challenge. This place has a booming happy hour business, and the lunch Bento for $8 is a fabulous deal, and a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This place was solid to say the least. I had the Champon Ramen and the octopus threw me off for a second I really enjoyed it. Staff was attentive and quick when they needed to be. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in at happy hour with my wife and 3 kids. We ordered a beer and several orders of rolls. Then.... Nothing for 45 minutes. We saw that it was busy, but about 30 minutes in I told the waitress that we needed to be somewhere in 15 minutes. She said she'd check on it. As we were getting up to leave she brought us the ticket and I told her that I would not pay full price for this and she said she'd see what she could do. Then she gave me 10% off. I told her that was unacceptable since we had no food and our kids had patiently waited too long already. The manager came out and said she could give me any more discount or else they'd not make any money. I told her that they had lost a customer and many more that I tell because the poor service and poor response to their mistake."}
{"text":"When I crave sushi, this has been my go to play. The price is pretty decent, especially during happy hour. I've had a different server every time but most have been pretty friendly and attentive. I love sitting at the bar and watch the chiefs work. They are a pretty friendly group. I enjoy the sushi and the service."}
{"text":"Despite some of the bad reviews on yelp, the quality of the sushi was a little better than expected. Sushi was fresh, price is reasonable, and portions are decent. On the flip side, service was garbage and it took almost 30 mins to serve us a small party tray."}
{"text":"Comfortable place with good sushi and fantastic happy hour pricing.  I have been there twice and both times the service was pretty good. Clean dining room and restrooms.  Don't be afraid to try this best kept Moon Valley secret."}
{"text":"Service could have been a little more friendly, but the sushi was good.food came out quickly.not my first pick if I'm looking for sushi but not my last."}
{"text":"Pretty bomb sushi for Phoenix. I don't know if this place would be considered a hole in the wall but I definitely wouldn't have known this was there if it wasn't for my wonderful sister in law. The rolls were pretty tasty. It wasn't super slammed when we came in so that was cool. We sat at the bar which I don't know if I would've or will again. We could hear the workers bitching and complaining a lot. Not something necessarily good for business. Also our waitress was kind of hovering over us. Besides those little annoyances all in all our tummies were satisfied."}
{"text":"2nd visit,  even better than the first.  Their cucumber salad is perfect, great miso soup, Philly roll, yum!  We shared beef fried rice as well which was very good.  Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a sushi snob, so I really enjoyed this place. The server was wonderful and super friendly, seating was immediate and the place was packed. We loved everything we ordered. The server even gave us everything on the happy hour menu and saved us about 20 bucks! Im kind of a novice so perhaps those with an advance palette would turn their nose up, but whatever, just means quicker services for me ;)"}
{"text":"I have tried sushi at a lot places and this is definitely one of my favorite places to go for sushi! My favorite is the gyoza appetizer, viva las vegas roll which is spicy so good,booty booty roll, climax and second climax roll, and guilty pleasure!!!! OMG delicious! I just wish thry had a better drink menu the one I saw was just beer, sake and wine. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came in with a hankering for some sushi and such. Friendly service and a great menu. The selection was fresh and tasted great. I will be back for more craving killers."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... I really do! The times where I had the sushi burrito from other places, it was always a big hit. It could have been so promising since it's right near work and I can order quickly from the take out Grabb app.  I ordered the Max burrito (tuna, avocado, cucumber, eel, crab, eel sauce, spicy mayo) - $12 - The raw tuna was kinda fibrous and very chewy. This was a bit off-putting as the fish didn't seem fresh. I think it might have passed the taste test on smaller rolls where the fish would be cut more finely but it's much more pronounced in a burrito.  - The taste was fine from the other ingredients and I wasn't sick afterward from the fish (phew.. so A-OKAY)  With so many sushi burrito and poke bowl places opening up, they really need to step up their game in terms of their food quality. I had a $5 discount from the app but for full price, it's not really worth it.   I picked up my order around 1:30pm. The server asked what did I ordered, which at that time I forgot the name of the burrito. She just handed my order, the Max roll. Every restaurant I ordered from the app, the restaurant was able to identify my order by my name and really aim to make sure my experience was good. It didn't seem like they put much effort on customer service here and didn't really pay much attention to identifying the customer. There were no customers there at that time.  But this was just how I felt from the brief exchange.   Overall the Yelp ranking here seems to be consistent with what you would expect in terms of food and service. I was hoping my experience would be different."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in town!!  Creative rolls that actually taste good!  Sushi Chef Kevin is totally willing to custom create what you want...I wanted the Alaska roll but was turned off by the imitation crab inside and asked to sub spicy tuna, he did and now it's my favorite roll, which I \"invented\"... I asked him to name it the \"Rebecca Roll\"...he's not THAT accommodating...yet!!  Maybe a few more times ordering it here and you too can eat the Rebecca roll."}
{"text":"Food is really good, customer servise is ok. Nice small place good for lunch dinner and happy our!!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for the price. We ordered a sushi party platter and they offered 10% off for online orders."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the the service was great as well. I wish i the waitress checked on us during the meal, but thats because i wanted to tell her how good the food was. Thanks for great food."}
{"text":"I'm not a sashimi girl so no review on that but the rest of their food is consistently DELICIOUS. I live close so am a frequent patron.  Service is always good, really friendly and cool like you want them to join you for a cocktail and chat. Dig the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great Lunch Specials with unbelievable prices!  I had the Katsu Bento that was accompanied by Salad, Rice, Gyoza, and Cali Roll.  Fit the bill in more ways than one!  It is hard to find such a hearty Japanese lunch with such quality for reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"More a happy hour quick cheap sushi.. Definitely a strip mall sushi place. Have to say Pei Wei has better fresher sushi with just their few options."}
{"text":"I used to like this place until tonight.  The first issue I had was that the fat sushi chef behind the bar was very unprofessional in how he was talking bad about customers and there needs.  Then my server Adam took a 12 minute smoke break out on the patio while I sat there with an empty drink.  I may not have noticed if the other two female servers would have filled it up on 4-5 times that they walked by me.  After Adam decided to come back, and actually do some work he decided that it wasn't important to wash his hands.  Keep reading it gets better.  He finally came by to grab my beverage so he could refill it, and while walking back with it and holding it by the top, I was thinking to myself if I should ask him to stir the sugar into my iced tea with his finger since it really couldn't get any more disgusting.  I can only imagine what their kitchen and walk-in coolers look like if this is what they allow the staff to do. The presence of an owner or any type of management is non existent.  Its like watching the insane running the assylum.  With over 18 years as a chef and restaurant consultant my suggestion would be to terminate all of the staff and start over with professional people that may look out for the good of the restaurant.  Also get a real manager that will hold the staff accoutable for their actions.  This place doesn't have a chance for longevity with how it is running currently."}
{"text":"Really great little sushi find and the reverse happy hour 8-10pm was a surprise bonus! Everything we had was fresh and tasty, and we left very happy. It is in a strip mall so if you are looking for nice ambience this probably isn't your place, but if you want a solid sushi place with a large selection of tasty rolls you will probably be in sushi heaven! We have been looking for a go to sushi place with good sushi and reasonable prices and have found our little sushi spot! :) In case you can't tell, we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here about three times now and this was by far the best experience I've had, thanks to Lindsey! The first few times I came here the service wasn't so great. I had problems with waiting over half an hour for our order, and quite a while to get the check too. The food was good, so I decided to give it another try. I'm glad I did, because the waitress this time was totally on top of it. We ordered a dish that we weren't specific enough with ordering, and she had it remade exactly how we like it. It's so nice to come back and get good service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This first time I went it was phenomenal! The second time I went my rolls were extremely dry and terrible. Plus the house salad is made with like a soy sauce base and not even the normal ginger sauce, it was a disappointment. I had to get rid of all my food the second time and couldn't even stomach it. :/ I'll most likely try one more time and see what happened."}
{"text":"Time for selfish confessions.  I have purposely not reviewed Sushi Style because I didn't want to share my fantastic find which would possibly lead to bigger crowds, longer wait times, and less sushi for me.  I said I was selfish...  It all began when Kampai, my favorite sushi place for over ten years, sold to new owners.  The search for a new place led me to Fresh Wasabi at 6645 West Bell Road.  After enjoying a wonderful omakase experience with owner, Masa Kim, I was confident that I would become a regular there.  When I mentioned this to Masa, and lamented the distance from my house to Fresh Wasabi, he advised that he owned another restaurant that was closer to my home called Sushi Style.  I literally went to Sushi Style the very next day and many, many days since.  If I am not there once a week, I begin having withdrawal symptoms.  The most I have gone is 4 times in 7 days and I am not ashamed to say so.  I would venture to guess that I have been to Sushi Style over 100 times in the past year.    What's so incredible to me is that I have never had the same meal.  Every visit is unique, amazing, and delicious.  I rarely order anything unless I am having a serious craving.  I feel completely safe in the hands of all of the sushi chefs.  Kevin, Danny, and Rafael have all created unique chef's choice dishes for me that were fabulous. Some of my favorite bites include:  Hamachi Kama (aka Yellowtail Collar, a cut of fish that many throw away, seasoned and grilled or broiled, served with a delicious dipping sauce and lemon); Asian BBQ Ribs (not listed on menu, just on a tiny sign near the hostess stand, but almost always available); Shishito Peppers (only one in ten is spicy hot, sauteed in the most delicious sauce and topped with bonito flakes); and White Hawaiian Tuna Ceviche Style.    I have made so many great friends here. It is not unusual for me to know every person sitting at the sushi bar on a given evening.  I tell anyone who will listen that this is the best sushi bar in town.  I can't tell you how many people I have sent that came back to me bragging about the wonderful experience they had.  If you like Japanese food made from scratch with authentic flavors and lots of love, then take my advice and get your butt in here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have finally found a sushi spot close to home with a great happy hour! We had cucumber salad, miso soup, California roll, rainbow roll, 2 piece sashimi and a shrimp crunch roll for $31 And a Kirin. Everything was top notch and hit the spot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, until I found hair in my sushi! Unacceptable!!!  Brought it up to the server, and was unresponsive, didn't even offer to take it off the check or anything. Very disappointed. Never going back!"}
{"text":"ordered take out as it was nearby and i was starving. to-go service was pleasant but the rolls (spicy tuna and godzilla) were so, so disappointing. too much rice and the rolls were not cut well, causing them to rip. the fish had an odd taste to it and just the overall presentation seemed as if it was slapped together haphazardly with no sense of pride from the chef. wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best in the area! I moved back to California recently and I find myself craving their sushi all the time. Do yourself a favor and eat here!! The Climax Roll is my all time fav along with the New York roll and First Love roll and their Las Vegas roll is a flavor bomb in ur mouth.  So good!!!! The service could have been better at times however they offer take out so problem solved! I miss this place."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, excellent service and ambience, inexpensive lunch specials...what more can you ask for! Sushi chef Danny is a master of his trade! Indoor and outdoor seating...cool origami hanging from the ceiling. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour Monday around 6pm. Wasn't too packed and we were greeted and seated right away. Our sever was friendly and attentive and the sushi is good and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Made my roll vegan by asking for no   crab in the California roll . Only $3.25 on happy hour and super yummy. The service was great too . Definitely reccomend"}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour - aw yis.  Then, deep fried rolls for the omg factor.  Chimichanga is my favorite.  It is like a sunset rolled into a harvest moon tied to Mozart's 5th symphony and then slathered in orgasm sauce."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Sushi restaurant before so for my first experience it went really well. Everyone there was very friendly and nice. Yong was our server and she made me feel comfortable and explained how everything goes and what's what. I do not like Sushi but my fiancee loves it. She enjoyed the Sushi and I enjoyed a chicken lo mien dish. We both had a blast and enjoyed the music and low lighting. It's a perfect place for date night or a girls night out!"}
{"text":"At first the server was a bit busy so we had a wait,  but this happens. Once the drinks and food arrived it was great.  Pricing is quite good for lunch menu.  I look forward to trying happy hour /dinner."}
{"text":"I like going to this place for their ramen.  There aren't that many places around us that serve ramen and when I have my craving, this is where we go.  If we are there during happy hour, we also order a few sushi rolls, which there are none that we have not liked.  Service is really friendly and there's always a table ready for us when we arrive.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by Sushi Style today for a bite of lunch.  Even though it was lunch hour and a lot of places are jam-packed, this sushi restaurant was busy but not to the point you had to wait for service.  The waitress was fantastic.  Before I even had settled fully in she had brought a delicious glass of fresh iced tea with lemon. I've been to places where you just have no idea if the tea has been sitting out for hours and is beginning to sour and it's not a pleasant experience.    I had a tootsie roll which was very good..the eel sauce combined with the crunch on a crab California roll was awesome.  I also had an Arizona roll which was again, awesome.  I will most likely be back very soon again for lunch or dinner.  My husband and I only go to one or two places for sushi, and this place gives Yen Sushi a run for its money with its broad menu and great service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet as I go here every couple of weeks. This is my favorite affordable sushi place. I always get the climax roll and tootsie roll as they are incredible. Flavor is on point! My 4 year old loves their tootsie roll and yakisoba noodles. The servers are so good, I haven't met one that didn't provide excellent service. Even, after my daughter spilt a whole juice all over the floor. They were gracious. We are truly lucky to have such a delicious sushi restaurant in Moon Valley!"}
{"text":"I use to really like this place. But, the new waitress was rude. While I was eating a fly sat down on my roll. I told one of the employees and she just looked at me. Didn't say a word. I asked another employee for a different plate and she brought me one. I didn't eat my roll and still got charged. I paid and left"}
