{"text":"Order the Tom Ka Gai, wich is the coconut soup. It is delicious. I also always order the beef salad. In fact I always order the same items when I go there."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food, medium heat has a good kick go 2 if ya want mild. No beer or wine! Bummer."}
{"text":"I ordered the sea bass & it was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent!! My wife had the Seafood Delight with a mild spice level & it was delicious!! I ate every single bit of the sauce! We had crunchy shrimp appetizer that was also excellent!! The garlic & black pepper Sea Bass was prepared like a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"I Love All the food I've had Here! Quality ingredients cooked perfectly. I'm pretty picky with my Thai food, b/c I use to live down the street from Thai Town in Los Angeles, and I can easily say this has been the best Thai food I've had in Henderson and Las Vegas, NV!"}
{"text":"Was craving Thai and decided to try this (right next to Meat and Three) ... Tom Kha was good, loved the broth but the shrimps were funky textured so chose not to eat them. My 8 year old had the pineapple fried rice which she devoured and ate the leftovers for dinner the next night...Hubby had the Massamon Curry which he liked better than Pin Kaow which was very surprising! We also had the appetizers combo which was good... Portions were huge and tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is great here and customer service is fantastic!!  I always order take out from here and im happy everytime! Lucky to have some good authentic thai so close to home! Beef salad and the soups are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their rating... the ownership recently changed and I've ONLY visited this restaurant under the new owners. I've been about four times and have been pleased with my meal every time. I've had their papaya salad, massaman curry, tom yum soup, tom kha soup, chicken larb, and beef salad. I've loved it all! I highly recommend any of those dishes... especially the chicken larb."}
{"text":"Thought the food was great, but service was terrible! There were only 3 tables, one guy, on a Wednesday and everything took forever! We both had curry- yum, and spring rolls as an appetizer- also yum. I hope they add more staff and update and clean the bathrooms."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!  The food is so delicious.  The restaurants is so clean and so inviting as well as the staff. Everything on the menu is perfectly prepared. My compliments to the chef and the staff!"}
{"text":"Very happy we tried this place out. Amazing food and service. We had beef yellow curry medium spicy,  shrimp pad thai, chicken satay to start. Everything was spot on, hands down one of the BEST restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"I went to Thai Thai tonight and found out that it has a new owner. The food was great and the service was excellent. Anisa waited on us. She was very attentive and we felt like we were well taken Care of. The food was great! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had."}
{"text":"It wasn't just a kitchen remodel...menu has changed; they took out some of our favs and 'simplified' a lot. We will go back for another try but I truly hope they haven't taken the guts out of a great place..."}
{"text":"Their food is great as well as their service. The food is authentic, the waiters are very friendly. Service is reasonable but a little on the slow side, however it is a nice way to unwind after a day of work. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. We live close by and frequently order here. Love to get their panang curry. They are always welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"I found myself in the area with some time to kill while I waited for my car to be detailed and decided to go on a walkabout in search of some late lunch.  After passing both a Vietnamese restaurant and a Japanese one I found Thai Thai and decided to give it a try.    Entering, I was immediately impressed with the appearance.  It was clean and orderly.  At the recommendation of the waitress (who I later came to suspect is co-owner/owner's wife), I ordered beef kung pao.  Just as she was about to put my order on the table she said \"uh oh.\"  The dish had been made with chicken instead of beef.  I said it was just fine as I really did prefer the chicken (for lunch) and it would go better with the glass of Chardonnay I had ordered.  I am no critic of either Thai or food in general, but my kung pao tasted pretty darn good to me!  Just the right combination of tender chicken, vegetables, peanuts, and a tasty (not too spicy - at my request) sauce.  Served with rice, it made the perfect lunch.  When presented with the check the waitress said she had taken off twenty percent of the bill.  (Don't know why but I presume because my dish had not been made as ordered.)  Didn't really matter to me though as I left the $20 as planned.  But it was a nice and thoughtful addition (or subtraction!).  I don't know that I would drive all the way across town to visit Thai Thai again.  But if you are in the area, I recommend.  They seem to be nice people.  I wish them well."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here, the staff could be a little friendlier and quicker. Otherwise really good place!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Thai place I've found in the LV area. Ordered the Pad Thai, and my wife got the Spicy Basil.  Service was good, and the food is to die (or kill) for.  Definitely looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews I see that there was a ownership change however looks like the food remains the same.  I haven't been for quite sometime however they had an eggplant chicken dish that is to die for.  I was diagnosed by my doctor as gluten sensitive so my visits to restaurants has drastically changed.  This is a 5 star rating from my past experience."}
{"text":"The food at Thai Thai is good across the board, although I don't think anything is great.  The one thing that pushes this restaurant up to four stars is that they aren't afraid to play kill the white boy while spicing up their dishes.  Medium spicy gets a nice sheen going on your forehead and going full Thai hot causes sweet, endorphin-pumping discomfort.  Service is very attentive, although I have never seen the restaurant slammed.  If you are in Anthem and don't feel like making the drive to Pin Kaow or Naga, it is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"We love Thai Thai! We order take away about once a week, on the weekends and has become our weekend family tradition. The food is excellent!   We like to order:   1. Pineapple Fried Rice ~ Fantastic combination of textures and flavor; Sweet and  Savory. My husband says it is nearly as good as the rice in Bangkok.   2. Green Curry w/ Chicken ~ I could swim in it! We order #1 spicy and I like \"spicy\" be conservative on the spice level you choose, their curries are very tasty and the spice level can be a \"barn burner!\"  3.  Mongolian Beef ~ Generous and richly flavored with lots of prime beef 4.  Chicken Pad Thai ~ Silky and full of Flavor.    The serve is wonderful, we will eat in on occasion and although it is usually quiet the serve and servers and gracious, friendly and fast. The place is clean and well presented.  As mentioned by other reviewers they have -10% Discount for cash and specials for take-away orders over certain amounts.    Truly a great place to have here in Anthem / Henderson."}
{"text":"The Thai tea is amazing!! I've went to different places with Thai tea but the best one is here! The green curry is so delicious!"}
{"text":"We were very regular delivery customers of this restaurant through three incarnations over the past seven years, but we will not be ordering from them again. Customer service is not a priority of the new owners, and while the food was good (if not a bit pricey), I don't patronize businesses that treat their customers rudely and casually."}
{"text":"I love Thai cuisine and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this restaurant has a new owner. It is a family run establishment. The staff is friendly, very attentive and the food is fantastic! Change can be a good thing and in this case, it certainly is.   I prefer vegan food and they are very aware of exactly what that means. So far I've not been disappointed. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This one of my favorite Thai restaurants! The pineapple fried rice and basil fried rice are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place so far! I have tried a few other places and this is the most convenient for me and the pricing is like a dollar cheaper than other Thai places. It's a small place but very cozy and the food is delicious. sometimes I order takeout, but I have eaten inside the restaurant once and the server was great. I always enjoy having a full glass of water and he kept makin sure my glass stayed full.  The food took a little long to come out but I assume that was because it's cooked to order. It did come out piping hot and delicious.   I also enjoy the Thai tea that they have. Sometimes while going to different Thai places the flavor isn't strong enough for me but here it is great and the promotions offer to check in and receive a free one, how could I pass that up?"}
{"text":"Thai Thai may be my new favorite Thai restaurant. The restaurant is elegant enough to have a nice family dinner, but also simple enough to just grab lunch on a normal day. The menu is complete with the best appetizers in town and delicious entrées.   Most people I bring here will eat a entrée like Pad Thai or one of their soup pots. While I prefer to explore their extensive variety of appretizers. Their Roti with Curry is a must try here. I love this dish whenever it's offered at other Thai or Malaysian restaurants, but the Roti with Curry here has to be the best I have ever tried. My only complaint about this dish is that I wish it came with more Roti slices. Their Raw Shrimp dish here is a must try if you're into it. I have to warn you, it's extra spicy! Their Thai Jerky here is also a must try, it is very tender and tasty unlike most place where it can be dry and tough to eat. Their Pad Thai here isn't my favorite, it's decent enough to eat, but I prefer to stick to the appetizers.   The presentation of the food here is really spot on. This may be one of my new favorite thai restaurants in town, just wish I would of tried it sooner! Lastly, don't forget to check in if you try this place, you get a free thai tea!"}
{"text":"We stopped in because of the reviews. We will be back. The food was great.  We have a great curry dish with Persian spices and a noodle dish.  Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Today I learned just how deep being mediocre can be. It seemed everything here was exactly that, to such a degree any further usage of the word \"mediocre\" will be lacking.  The food is bland but cheap, so it's ok. The service is present but not attentive. The place is clean but not inviting or enjoyable. It's certainly a cheap lunch spot with ample seating, but I can't imagine thinking that this would be the place to go for Thai food. Just head north and have a better experience!  The soup set the tone. Cucumber and egg in a clear broth, through and through devoid of any real flavor. The yellow curry I had was unremarkable in flavor or texture, not very spicy even though it was 5*. The pad kee mao was also wholly unremarkable.  In fact, the only thing remarkable about the place is how consistently they were unremarkable in all categories.  With the price, it's hard to complain. If it were a dollar more, I'd give it two stars. I'm still tempted to give it two stars just to offset the rating, but three is more fair. I can't imagine I'll return, as I have to drive past several other good options on the way there."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service & very affordable! Food & drinks came very fast. Definitely coming back. I can highly recommend their pad Thai and Thai iced tea-so yummy"}
{"text":"This beautifully-decorated restaurant serves one of the best Thai food I've ever had in America! I'm from Thailand so I know what I'm talking about. The food is authentic and very tasty. I enjoyed every spoon of the dish I got. My husband and parents also loved their food! The lunch special comes with soup, crispy egg roll, salad and fried wonton. The portion was good, not too much food but enough to fill your stomach. The Thai iced tea costs only a dollar! The service was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were careful and paid attention to our requests and made sure the food came out how we wanted (no onions+garlic). They also play beautiful easy-listening Brazilian and French songs which created a cozy cafe-like atmosphere. More than anything, we love the decoration. It's really cute! We absolutely enjoyed our experience dining at Thai Thai. If you come to Las Vegas and look for a restaurant with good atmosphere and serves delicious food, this is the place to go to! Easily 5 stars out of 5!"}
{"text":"The go-to spot when we're craving Thai food.  Good food, fair prices (discount if you pay by cash). Nice clean and quiet restaurant. We usually order Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Crab Fried Rice, Satay and Fried Tofu. It may not be as \"fancy\" as the other Thai restaurants out there, but their food is good and gets the job done."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Thai places in Henderson with great prices compared to other places. It's a cute little place with friendly staff. The food is always great. I normally get vegetable ginger and basil fried rice and neither disappoint."}
{"text":"Just love the food especially rad na and Tom yum soup! If you like raw shrimo, their naked shrimp with the spicy sauce it's brilliant!!"}
{"text":"Ordered off of their new lunch menu. Food was good, however when I ordered my food to go the person taking my order had no idea what item off the menu I was talking about. I had to repeat it to her several times and tell her where this item was located on the menu. Also since I ordered from the lunch menu I thought I was going to get the soup, salad, and egg roll as advertised on their menu however when I got home I realized I did not receive any of those things. Overall I like the food but the service seemed like it was lacking."}
{"text":"Thanks Thanks, Thai Thai for being an awesome lunch place in my hood. The lunch specials at $7.95 at this hidden gem are great! Plus with your Facebook or Yelp check in you get a free Thai tea with your meal. Not only are you getting a delicious meal at $7.95 you can get a free tea to boot! Yessss!!!  I ordered the yellow curry with chicken. It came with soup, salad, rice, egg roll and fried wonton wrapper- All not bad for the price! When you order you can adjust the spiciness from 1-5, I ordered 4 but I think I could of ordered the 5. Please don't think just because I could order a 5 means that it wasn't spicy, it just means that I've probably increased my spice pallet over the years or burned the \"hot and spicy\" taste buds on my tounge.   All in all, for $7.95 the meal plus \"yelp\" tea is an extraordinary deal! Now I need to come in for dinner"}
{"text":"Unlike the every block sushi bars, Chinese take-away and multiple pho restaurants in this little corner of Henderson, finding a Thai restaurant is like finding a needle in a haystack. For the neighborhoods of Anthem, Seven Hills or Horizon Ridge Thai Thai seems to be the only real choice for Thai food for those who live above St. Rose.   For Thai food I am pretty standard as I stick with the noodle dishes of either Pad Thai with or the Pad Kee Mao with those yummy fat noodles! I can be a creature of habit so I always add beef and tofu to either of those dishes.  I have tried both of my habitual noodle dishes at Thai Thai and they are pretty solid for the price.   Like at any Thai restaurants you can kick it up a notch or two or five or ten by using their hotness scale. No, not how hot you think you are but how hot you want your food. My general rule is one or two numbers before the top number. I do like it hot. Chica en fuego!  For those of you who live on the edge and I mean the edges of Henderson, check it out. For the prices and the quick service, Thai Thai is good for  that Thai fix."}
{"text":"Terrible,  gross,  smelly,  dirty.  I love good food,  what happened to the great food they had before here?   I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai lunch special,  it came with veggie Tom Yum and a veggie egg roll.  The Tom yum was watered down and the Veggies where beyond limp, there were two pieces of broccoli that where a nice shade of dead brown. The egg roll was nice and crispy.   The Pad Thai noodles where under cooked which made them plastic like, inedible. The Shrimp seemed boiled and unseasoned.  The little sauce in the pad Thai smelled of rotten fish. I told the cook when he walked out and all he said was,  so sorry and walked away.   So much for the lunch special, $12 later I walked out having only eaten the crispy egg roll."}
{"text":"Happen to stumble upon this place while driving around looking for a place to have lunch. Service was great and the the food was even better. We started with the Thai Dumplings and the Crab Fried Rice (Real Crab not imitation) and the Combination Panang Curry. Finished it off with the delicious Sweet Mango with Sticky rice. Prices were reasonable and everyone was very friendly. Definitely coming back and bringing more people to share my experience with."}
{"text":"Thai Thai is a great Thai restaurant.......everything we ordered was delicious and so much food we got to enjoy it again the next day."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for Thai and it just happened to be around lunch time. I looked on Yelp and have already tried all the other Henderson Thai places and many in Vegas.  We walked in to Thai Thai and it was small but very nicely decorated , the waitress Bo was super helpful and very nice. We ordered form both the lunch menu and the regular menu. We had the Tom yum goon shrimp soup ,the Sa Tay pot stickers ,  Thai beef fried rice , egg rolls , my son has the pad Thai off the lunch menu and I had the yellow chicken curry also off the lunch menu ,,, and can I tell you  I've had Thai all over the states and Vegas and this is by far the best I've ever had . Every single thing we ordered Was delicious , fresh and came out quickly  . We'll be back real soon , strongly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the service & atmosphere of this little joint. The food is delicious :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that my local Thai food joint is under new management. Food was adequate, but had better. Service was excellent, even received a complimentary thai tea for Valentines Day visit. Rating 3 star for taste of food. When you want a quick fix to satisfy your craving for Thai food check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!  Had pad Thai and mum had beef green curry.   I ordered 4 spicy and it had a bite spicier than the other Thai I used to go so I'd do 3 for spicy next time.   Also LOVED green curry sauce and will order that veggie next time!    Serving was enough for 2 meals, although we used our own rice for leftovers."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated place. I ordered basil fried rice and got a free Thai iced tea with Yelp check-in. The Thai tea was pretty good (not sure if it's especially better bc it was free lol). Basil fried rice was good but not the best of what I've had. Very friendly waitress.   Will go back and try their curry dishes next time."}
{"text":"Very average Thai food. Have had better @ Archies & way better service. Waitress acted like she was put out because she had to wait on our table at 12pm during the middle of the work week. Would not go back & pay money to be treated the way we were. Much better Thai places that treat paying customers better."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food was great. Not quite five-star, so we will keep looking for our #1 Thai stop."}
{"text":"Big fan of this Thai restaurant.  The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the incredibly slow delivery time of the food.  Otherwise I would highly recommend this place! The beef salad and papaya salad are exceptional.  I always get it at the spiciest setting and they never fail to deliver an incredible dish.  I dare say... This may be the best thai place in town."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai with chicken. Warning: I got a level two spicy (they offer one-five, one being mild) and I would have personally rated it a three. I enjoy spicy food so it wasn't a bad thing, just be sure to get a level one if you aren't a fan of heat! My girlfriend ordered Pad See Ew with tofu and she was served chicken instead. She isn't a vegetarian so it wasn't a problem but that was a large mistake that a lot of people would complain about, especially considering her dish came out five minutes after mine. This was an error on the kitchens end because our receipt said she ordered tofu and not chicken.  There was one woman serving/bussing the entire restaurant. She was also handling carry-out orders. Her service was great and she was very polite, I could tell she was working very hard. The service was just a little bit slower because she was handling everything herself.  I would definitely recommend this place. Lost a star because of the mishap with the chicken/tofu. Don't let the worry of slower service scare you, the food is worth every minute of the wait."}
{"text":"Quiet and cozy restaurant with delicious food and excellent and friendly service. We just keep going back for more!  Try the Thai dumplings and the eggplant entree. The best!"}
{"text":"Spicy and delicious!!!  I'm always impressed by the level of satisfaction I have with Thai food in Las Vegas but this really knocked it out of the park!  It's a small, cute, hole-in-the-wall location like most good Asian restaurants. The decorations are nice and the atmosphere is welcoming. We came here for a casual date night and it fit our purpose perfectly.   Started off with the crunchy and fresh vegetarian egg rolls. They came out hot from the fryer and hit the spot perfectly. We are Pad Thai addicts! So I ordered chicken pad Thai with a medium spice (5 out of 10) and my boyfriend ordered pork Pad Thai (8 out of 10 spicy). It came out quickly and you could tell it was straight from the pan! (I hate when food has been sitting for awhile in the kitchen and it's almost cold by the time you get it). The noodles were cooked to perfection and the spicy level was on point! I may be kind of a baby, but mine tasted hella spicy but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it.   I highly recommend this to any Thai lovers!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant with good food.  We had the curry dishes which were very good.  Reasonably priced and good service."}
{"text":"I eat alot of Thai! This has been a great little find. I will certainly return to try the rest of my favorite dishes. The sisters were very nice, friendly, funny. They shared their favorite dishes on the menu as we ordered. I saw a lot of delivery orders being taken and to-go orders being picked up but not very many people dining in (worth the effort to sit down). Small place, great food!"}
{"text":"Under new management but still delicious! We ordered pineapple curry. Pad kee mao. Chinese broccoli w crispy pork. Fish cakes(meh) . Coconut ice cream w roti...all delish! I already know what im coming back for!"}
{"text":"Second visit to this restaurant but the first under the current ownership. Since our last visit the food remains very tasty and the service was fantastic. My two negatives are they do not yet have a liquor license. They said they are working on that and well, you know how city permits and such work so I can not really fault Thai Thai. They will get it soon I predict. The thing that really throws me is the decor. One would expect a Thai vibe inside a Thai restaurant right? Here, it is obvious they have gone to much effort to make the restaurant look very nice yet it feels more like a fancy boutique or something as you can see from pictures others have taken. Fancy, but not Thai. I would strongly recommend the owners try again in their decor choices."}
{"text":"Dined here a few times. This restaurant is located on Eastern and Sunridge Heights.  Ordered the pad see ew, on a '4' out of 5 spice scale - for me that was nothing, I should have ordered a 5 spice dish to actually feel a kick ! Noodles are flavorful , with plenty of veggies - and service was quick. My food came out in just a few minutes.  For dessert , I had their roti w/ coconut ice cream. Their coconut ice cream is legit.  Their lunch specials come with a salad , soup , rice , egg roll and fried wonton wrapper - pretty good for price of 7.95$ !  Only thing that upsetted me was that they charge for brown rice. No where on the menu does it say I will be charged for brown rice on lunch menu , it just says entrees comes with steamed rice. So , steamed rice = white rice only ? I feel when a customer asks for brown rice , the waiter should tell them it will be extra . .  I told my waiter that , but no apology or anything. I try paying with two cards - one for my lunch , one for the brown rice. One of my cards didn't go through , so he didn't charge me for the brown rice. If I paid with one card (mind , I always pay with just one card at restaurants except for this one time) , he would've charged me for brown rice.  Good Thai food , but the hidden brown rice surcharge is a big negative to me.  Bathrooms are located at the far back, through a lengthy hallway."}
{"text":"Its the best and  cheap thai restaurant near my house. It's usually my go to place for take out. They have many different items on their menu, but the I love their pineapple curry or spicy basil leaf chicken. Each item is around $10 and you will always have left overs for next day. They can make the food very spicy based on your pallet. I've also noticed that they have good lunch specials, which include salad, half-entree and a spring roll.   Service could use a little bit of improvement, but overall its excellent. (Score: 4/5)"}
{"text":"Well, I'm really disappointed to post this, but Thai Thai is now under new management.  I printed out an online coupon, and presented it before ordering.  I was told that the coupon would not be honored, even though it's expiration date was still six weeks away.  Next, I tried to order my favorite dish, which was still on the menu, and was told that it was not available.  It seems that things have gone downhill with the new management, and now I won't be returning to my old favorite restaurant for Thai food.  Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Wifey found this little gem in Henderson. What great food and service. The yellow curry medium heat was excellent. Wifey had the Basil duck. That was delicious.  And my sister in law had garlic pepper pork. She is rubbing her belly right now and that means it was onolicious. Don't forget the crab rangoon and the grilled jumbo squid for appetizers. Just tell the waitress to grill it more so little bit charred. A must eat place before you die. I would imagine other items would be just as good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I ordered the Pineapple Curry with 3 on the spice scale. Came out perfect! Just Spicy enough to leave a tingle on my tongue (and a slightly runny nose!). Hole in the wall places really are the best! I found new favorite place when I'm craving non-traditional food!"}
{"text":"Was excited to get the fresh rolls. Lady said they were out of them. It was lunch time and they were not busy. How could they be out because they are only good fresh made to order. Got the green curry lunch special. Salad was basically cut up lettuce. Hardly any dressing. I think the dressing was just vinegar. Soups was cold. Not pleasant looking. Ordered green curry with 4 spice level and I think it was a 1. Green curry was less than par. Not very flavorful, but was colorful. Egg roll was best tasting.   Won't come again."}
{"text":"Food quality continues to be good at Thai Thai, but recent visits have been disappointing. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My hopes were high when reading some of the reviews posted below.  Food Quality:  Marginal / Fair at best  Service: Slow and a total inability to communicate at any level. I was amazed by how long people getting \"to go\" orders had to wait for their food. Even the service at our own table was shoddy.  Ambience: Needs vast improvement  Prices: Not outrageous, but simply not justified by the service, ambience or food quality.  Likelihood I would return?  10-15%. Maybe with a 75% off coupon."}
{"text":"After trying Thai Thai we have officially met satisfaction. Not only are the prices great, but the flavors were amazing and FRESH!! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's not closed!!  Reopened with new manager. Lee is super awesome and service is great.  I  loved all my dishes  ... so great!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I've been eating here for years. Awesome service and very good food. Their soups are delicious and my go to is always the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I had better.  I had their lunch special which is overly priced and not updated on their menu.  Their large chicken satay appetizer was overly cooked.  $13 lunch special was not worth it.  Definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here. Everything in the order was correct upon getting it home. A few of us had the papaya salad, which was good. I ordered all of the them at a spice level 1 and a few in my party thought that was a bit too spicy still, though I did not.  I also had the panang curry, which was great. Not too spicy and the perfect consistency."}
{"text":"This is my third time here. Food is good, but not excellent. Service is very friendly, but hit or miss.   The first time we ordered Chicken Basil, but the chicken was ground chicken. Appearance with the ground chicken was not eye appealing. It put off my wife, and now we now order everything with tofu to be safe.   It's not the best Thai I've ever had, but it's good and nearby.    The decor of the restaurant is not perfect either; lighting is too bright and the decor is not Thai.    Attention to detail!"}
{"text":"Great menu design. Cozy modern Thai restaurant and everything we ate had amazing presentation! Definitely recommend anything with curry.   Sooo yummy"}
{"text":"Most delicious Thai in Las Vegas!  Pumpkin curry is the best I've ever tasted.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Such a cute Thai restaurant. Amazing service and food.  Will come back again!! If you live near this area. Definitely come check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chinese orange chicken lunch special with fried rice and house dressing on my salad. The dressing was really good!! Taste like coconut! The orange sauce for the chicken was very orange tasting. The fried rice was flavorful."}
{"text":"The photos are SO enticing.  My food experience... Highly disappointed.    First off service did not suffer.  I appreciate our server.  The food arrived quickly.  Even received my free Thai iced tea. Thank you for that.   The beef jerky, too strong of a marinade for me to finish the whole thing.  Mediocre.  The duck bun was decent.  It isn't like Peking duck the skin was soft. It was the texture of a bbq pork bun, soft and saucy.  It was average.  The spring rolls were not bad.  Full of mostly bean sprouts.  Tasted very much \"of the earth\".  I'm always embarrassed to say this... But I watched my date pull a long hair out of his mouth as he ate this.  But that wasn't what made me lose my appetite.  The large prawn Tom yum.  It was so visually appealing. As soon as it was brought to the table I could smell the strong fishiness of it.  I gave it a go and the taste of these prawns...  Old and once frozen probably.  I tried to drink the soup. I hate being wasteful.  But it just drowned in fishiness.  So much so the taste the smell would not leave me.  She gave us a to go box and I couldn't even bring myself to pack it up.  Barely made a dent.  My stomach turned. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I really like Thai Thai! I had a bit of a cold and went in for some super spicy roast duck curry to open up the old nasal passages. It did not disappoint! We also enjoyed the chicken satay and spring rolls appetizers. My wife ordered the Mongolian Beef and said it was the best she'd ever had. I snuck a little bite and agree. It's FANTASTIC! I usually get the green curry with pork but was in a mood for some duck. It was flavorful, just enough fat (but not too much) and pretty spicy at a \"6\" like I ordered it. I'm usually a \"4\" or \"5\" guy, but the extra spice was just what I needed. The hostess is adorable and attentive. She was very busy with a pretty full restaurant, but we never felt neglected. This is our go-to Thai place close to the house and we'll keep going back. YUM!"}
{"text":"REALLY good Thai in Henderson!  Thanks to my friend Jared for telling me about it.  Cheap and fast. It's a tiny place, but the curry is SO good!  They do the spice level on 1-5.  Order one level lower than you think.  Trust me.  I likey the spicy and a 3 was PLENTY for me.  My wife likes mild and a 1 was too much for her.  Gonna try to get her a zero next time.  The server was lovely and kind.  The food was GRADE A!  Just go already!  Oh yeah, 10% cash discount.  Golden!"}
{"text":"Won't go back. Under new management and they changed the crab rangoon to be just like everyone else's.... nothing good about it. The chicken wraps had pieces of inedible something that you couldn't bite into. The stuff that you find in ground meat, not sure what it is & I don't think I want to know."}
{"text":"This place is listed on yelp twice under Thai Thai Restaurant & Thai Thai.  I unfortunately found it first under Thai Thai Restaurant which had them at 5 stars...the other listing is at 3.5 stars.  We went in for lunch today & will not be going back as Pin Kaow 3 down on Eastern is a better option.  We were the only ones in the restaurant.  A couple with a baby showed up later after we finished our meal...no one else.  I got the Spicy Basil with Beef & she got the Sweet & Sour Chicken lunch special.  Spice ratings are 1-5, I went with a 3, she went with a 2.    Our vegetable only Tom Yum soup arrives first.  It has got a fair amount of veggies in it.  It's sweet, not hot & sour like I'm accustomed to.  The salads come out & I pick out 4 wilted pieces of lettuce.  There is hardly any peanut dressing on it.  The eggrolls are nothing special & could pass for frozen.  There is little to no dipping sauce for them.  My \"Spicy\" Basil dish is lacking in spice & basil.  It would've been more appropriate to call it Salty Beef with 2 Basil Leaves.  It was fairly oily, I chalk that up to low quality ground beef being utilized.  I had to ask for hot sauce/chili flakes as the spice level was more like a 1/2-1...not 3.  This was the blandest (minus the salt) example of the dish I've had anywhere.  Her Sweet & Sour Chicken on the other hand is more like a Spicy & Sour Chicken...lot's of heat.  Too much for her actually.  She wasn't able to finish it due to it being spicier than what she is comfortable with.  Maybe the chef got our 2s & 3s mixed up?  Also, their website which is linked on yelp apparently isn't theirs (anymore).  They won't honor some things on it such as a Thai Coffee or Thai Ice tea coming with your lunch special for $1 more.  There is a 10% discount if you pay with cash.  I had none, so I payed with a debit card.  When the waitress returned with the bill & my card, she neglected to give me a pen...a great way to end our lunch.  Looks like this place has had a name change as well as management change in the last 6 months alone.  They need to change the quality of the food if they want to stick around."}
{"text":"Yay Thai Thai for Valentines! The service was great and so considerate. This place is friendly for vegetarians and they are flexible with their dishes. They even gave us a valentines coconut ice cream dessert, really hit the spot. 10% off for paying in cash."}
{"text":"So my favorite Thai place got new owners, found out picking up food today, it would be wrong to say that the food i picked up was bad however it was not as good as it consistently have been over the last few years, it has been incredibly consistent and incredibly good, as i said i am hesitant to say the food is not good but it is not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. A clean, with today's trend restaurant tucked away in the Sunrise Village Plaza shopping strip mall. The Fresh Ginger entree with chicken was very tasty. Also enjoyed the pineapple curry also with chicken. It was a quiet night and we were the only table in the restaurant so the service was good and the food cane out quickly. The reviews are accurate - try Thai Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, fast, friendly.  Everything is tempting.  If you are looking for a positive dining experience, please dine at Thai Thai.  It's great for vegans, too.  They will make your food without eggs.  It's easy to make dining at this restaurant a major habit.  I am grateful to have Thai Thai as a dining option."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! From the service, food, and environment. I wasn't planning on coming here, I was driving around and came across this place, I made the best decision by coming in because I discovered the best Thai restuarant! I got the beef salad and it was simply the best I've had, very authentic."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Pack with food quality and quantity with affordable price. We really love the specials menu with 1. Salad. 2. Soup 3. Appetizer 4. Main course.   Depending on what meat you get the price start from $ 9.95 - $ 12.95.   If you have time and want to try authentic food. Please come here!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and you'd never expect it based on its nondescript storefront. I order from here at least every other week!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent thai food. Love the pumpkin curry... yum yum.  But sometimes they are not consistent with taste especially with delivery.  :("}
{"text":"Food was great!  Except for that salmon fish with same sauce.  Service was slow,  1 server for the whole restaurant.  He takes all the calls, he's the host, and also the cashier.  We were the first customer and the last on to get out of that place.  One reason was he forgot to ring one of our too.  Toilet was clog that nigh too."}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from here using Uber Eats for a while now and had the pleasure of eating there in person last night.  What a nice, cozy little place!  The owner Lee is an absolute sweetheart and gives the best customer service.  The food is was all delicious (which we already knew from ordering there before).  We ordered the spicy basil chicken, pineapple fried rice, papaya salad, and calamari.  Nothing disappointed.  I would love to see the restaurant so well and stay so please go bring your friends and family and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very memorable to me at all. I had the yellow curry but honestly nothing really stands out. There are so many better Thai restaurants in the area. Just a few that come to mind are Siri, Pin Kaow, and Naga.  What I do remember is how cold it was in there. Really can't see myself coming back. There are just better options."}
{"text":"The appetizers are big and the entrees are big. Nice portions to share. Great atmosphere and close to home. Authentic Thai flavor. ;) CCWMaggie"}
{"text":"First off this place was good, now there is a new owner / chef and it is even better. Curries and Soups and are amazing the best and most flavorful better than Lotus for the usual suspects. Place is the best in town for regular thai food, as in you won't find anything here you never heard of.. BIGGEST complaint no more stuffed chicken wing! And why is there no crispy rice salad??? Anyways I eat here at least one time a week."}
{"text":"We order from here about twice a month and have never actually eaten at the restaurant but really enjoy the food since the new management took over. For us, the food is more flavorful than previously but I can only speak of the handful of dishes we consistently order. I've ordered at numerous Thai places in different cities and can't really say there is a vast difference from place to place. Everyone seems to make some dishes better than others. The ONLY exception to this is Lotus of Siam because of the regional style of food they serve and it is what I've experienced as the closest to what I've been told is true Thai food.  Our usual items - Spicy Basil leaf with ground chicken, Pad Ke Mao, red and green curries, Garlic Pepper chicken, Cashew chicken, & Tom Yum Gai.  All very good and full of veggies and flavor. Curries are nice and thick and red curry includes a good amount of eggplant. Pad Ke Mao is stir fried with just the right amount of spicy, sweet, soy sauce flavor.   The only dishes I didn't really like too much was the soup and eggrolls. Their version of the Tom Yum Gai didn't have the lemon grass or galanga root flavor like other places and tasted off. It was too sweet, didn't have the slight sour flavor or much of any other flavor I was used to from other thai places. Eggrolls are pretty much fillers but their version is lacking in any flavor.   All in all, really like this place, it's closer to where we live, and prices are in line with pretty much everyone else (Pin Kaow, Gaati, Ping Pong)"}
{"text":"Recently received a menu through the mail for Thai Thai and thought I'd give them a try.  Ordered carryout and arrived to see three couples seated throughout the dining area at 7 PM on a Saturday night.  Carryout order was ready as promised and when opened at home food was hot.  Mrs. ordered soft shell crab fried rice ($16).  Crab was fried in heavy batter and sliced, placed on top of fried rice, if that's what you'd like to call it.  No scallion, searched to find evidence of an egg and fried so lightly, it's color was lighter than brown rice.  I ordered fresh ginger entree and added beef as meat selection, heat level 3 ($10).  Ingredients are ginger, mushroom, celery and onion.  It did have ginger and onion, but instead had red and green pepper, broccoli and carrots.  Beef slices were good.  No hint of spiciness, small portion, came with side of white rice.  Spring rolls were expertly fried and delicious.  Other reviews have mentioned orders were  screwed up and to me that is the linchpin to a good restaurant.  Sounds like dysfunctional kitchen.  If dining, you may have your order corrected, carryout, not so much."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm Thai.  I've been living in Vegas/Henderson over the past 15 years and  been to my fair share of Thai restaurants all over town.  I can honestly say Thai Thai is hands down the best one I've been to.  I love everything they do here.  Food is exceptionally well prepared.  It's not greasy and over seasoned yet still flavorful.  The ingredients are fresh and authentic.   I ordered spicy soft shell crab ssalad and it was heaven on a plate. Shrimp Pad Thai and Pad Se Eiw were done to perfection just like they are in Thailand.     The place is rather small but welcoming, clean, and cozy.  The service is conscientious and prompt.  The owners are always very nice and accommodating to our requests.  This place is a MUST and deserves a 5/5 rating.  A must try in Las Vegas/Henderson"}
{"text":"Great Thai food restaurant.  We made take out and they wrapped very well and easy to eat.  Tofu soup was too much soup, but didn't have much tofu inside.  Overall great food"}
{"text":"I am VERY impressed. Cannot wait to order here again.  Order thru eat 24 .com, prices weren't amazing but I split a few things with a friend so it made it worth it. After I tried the food, it is so worth the cost.  The food arrived 20 min before they said it would be which I thought was awesome!!   Now the food omg, coconut shrimp was delicious, pad Thai medium  and the egg rolls were the best egg rolls over ever had, seriously.   Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE!  Ordered and waited 2 hours before it was confirmed they were not bringing the food. At 40 mins was told a driver was 10 mins away and again at an 1 hour 15.  Never ever had service that bad."}
{"text":"I found this place by surprise and I'm so glad I did! I originally go to another Thai restaurant but the woman on the phone told me their was a huge order placed before me so it would be a hour wait. I was so hungry so I thought I would do my research and find another place. This restaurant was the closest to my house so I ordered shrimp pad Thai and crab Rangoon when I arrived to pick up my order...the place was a little empty so I thought to myself \"hopefully I made the right decision and this taste good\" when I got home and took the first bite...I was surprised on how good it was! Extra spicy just like I like it and the shrimp was a good size! The crab Rangoon was delicious also! The pictures on here just don't do this restaurant justice! And I only hope more people find out about this place so it can be busy like it's supposed to be! A must try!"}
{"text":"Horrible.... I ordered take out and got crab Rangoon, curry with chicken, and shrimp chow mein.... crab rangoon was burnt on the top.. I asked for mushroom on the chow mein, paid $2 extra for them , and it was 3 mushrooms sliced in half  not cooked... also I only got 4 small shrimp and was made with spaghetti noodles... and the curry only had 6 small pieces of chicken... never again!"}
{"text":"Very average Thai meal - if i lived down across the street i'm not sure if i would frequent this place.   I feel you can pay cheaper, go to an Archi's and get better.  We ordered a Thai BBQ chicken which was was dry and lacked flavor.  I think if i google'd a Thai BBQ chicken recipe and attempted to cook it myself, it would turn out better.....and i don't cook......at all  The rest of the dishes were decent.   It was edible.  But with so many other options in this area, you're better off somewhere else or if you're really craving Thai you can do much better."}
{"text":"We love Thai Thai - the best Thai we've found in the Vegas area yet and super convenient for people who live in Henderson / Anthem Highlands.  The eggplant basil is really delicious and they give you free veggie spring rolls if you order takeout.  Be sure to take cash for the 10% discount!  It's a small space, so not great for huge groups.  They can fit one, maybe two big groups in there, so be sure to call ahead of time if you have a lot of people with you."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, but the service was on top of it! She was sweet & helpful. We ordered the duck bun, but they were out of buns on a Saturday night so we had to skip that. We ordered hor mok which had lots of different seafood but for $16 was way too small, more of a 1 person dish. The pineapple fried rice was good, but lacked a lot of pineapple. Our final dish of basil duck was interesting and different for a Thai restaurant, but I probably wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"We picked up some combination pad Thai on our way home tonight and it was super disappointing. No peanuts, no lime, bright orange sauce, almost no bean sprouts, lukewarm. My boyfriend isn't crazy about spice so we went with a level 2 heat which was more like what I would expect from a 3+ level and was definitely pushing his limits. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Its pretty good food and reasonably priced. Staff is friendly enough. Got the yellow curry and it was good."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by Yelp . Food was so amazing and real authentic Thai. Service was so great . I definitely go back again. Love it !!! This place will absolutely be my fav restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like this gem in a strip mall. They have a spring roll with shrimp but I don't like it with shrimp so instead they add strawberries and green apples. Fantastic! This is a first and I've been hooked. Their Yom won sen is delicious and the grab Rangoon's are .  I hope they continue to stay open and I'm kind of glad they aren't slammed with business. They are really nice when I go in and do take out. Always eager to please and just all around great customer service"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant with quiet atmosphere. The interior is kind of kitschy and very local. I ordered the Penang curry with tofu and it was very tasty. However the pad see ew and pad Thai were too dry for my taste. The takeout experience was very smooth and my food was waiting for me at the allotted time."}
{"text":"As a lover of quality foods and flavors, I was happily surprised to find this place. Good service and clean dining room. Then the food- Perfect Massaman Curry and Shrimp Pad Thai. Large portions at fair prices. Mango with sticky rice dessert was just right! We will drive to dine here and wish them great success! A+"}
{"text":"Fantastic soup, good cut of meet on the beef salad and right level of spiciness on the yellow curry.  Good quality at a good value.  Comfortable atmosphere.  New customer for as long as I live in the Vegas area.  Super glad to have found your location."}
{"text":"This place is yummy. The lunch specials are awesome, and even dinner is very reasonable. The panang curry and larb salad are my favorites. I'll definitely be adding this to my list of Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow, not sure why this place has good reviews. Maybe because there's not much Thai places in this side of town, so there's nothing great to compare it to. First of all, it's completely overpriced. Second of all, the portion sizes are literally half of any full portion size from any other Thai restaurant out there. Half size portions for double the money. Food is completely OK. Nothing to write home about, but definitely something to write on Yelp about from the disappointment."}
{"text":"Good size portions. The Seafood Lad Na was okay. Good amount of seafood in it. Gravy was okay. Nothing amazing, just okay.   The spicy basil dish was okay, too. It's not terrible, just okay.   The beef jerky was pretty bad. Super burnt. I felt like, someone scraped off the bottom of a used bbq grill and served me whatever they found down there. Burnt meat that fell of the grill mixed in with charcoal. It was terrible. I would give 2 stars because of this, but left the 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt. I'll try again one more time to make up my mind about this place.   Overall, just okay. Meh."}
{"text":"My favorite for lunch.The server is fabulous really knowledgeable. The food is great. The prices are reasonable. They have specials where you could combine their different entrees so you could actually taste and create an astounding meal for less than 10 dollars. It is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and easy to pick up on the way home, therefore it's been one of our go-to places. They have some good lunch specials that are well priced, but I generally don't make it for lunch,m. My dinner it usually a Thai basil chicken dish and they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great amount of food for the price. Lunch specials especially. I've been there about six times. This time, though, it took quite a while for water to be offered and I sat around for quite a bit longer gazing at my phone and waiting for someone to take my order. Once ordered, the salad and app came out right away. My Thai tea was delightful. My Pad Thai on the other hand was one dimensional and sweet. Weirdly sweet. No break in flavor amongst ingredients- the bean sprouts tasted like the egg that tasted like the noodles. And everything was drenched in a sweet sauce. No my favorite. I feel like the basil and spicy dishes are their wheelhouse.  They give a 10% discount for cash payment. But my bill was very reasonable even with using a card."}
{"text":"The place is small and intimate. I would suggest making reservations for large parties. We had the soft shell fried rice and Seafood Delight: Sauteed combination seafood with bell pepper, basil leaves, pepper and chili. They were delectable. Both the dishes were flavorful and you could tell the freshness of the ingredient. The portion is not very big however. The Thai coffee was delightful.  The waitress was very attentive. The restaurant was very clean. They do not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Like the food presentation and flavor. Squid, crabmeat fried rice, chicken Penang, shrimp phase Thai. Great food"}
{"text":"Used to be called Pat Thai. I enjoy everything I try here. My usual order is yellow curry or their delicious Pumpkin curry! You can't go wrong with their Pad Thai either!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Thai food. Under new management and we are impressed with the quality of food here. Great food and super reasonable.  Everything we have tried have been so good. I'll be posting some of their dishes and must try. Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery yesterday for dinner. Great customer service on the phone and prompt delivery. Ordered the pot stickers, which were tasty. Got chicken pad Thai, which didn't have very much chicken and not very much peanut flavor and no actual peanuts. I would say it was mediocre. Also ordered chicken fried Thai rice and that also lacked meat and flavor. Overall, I would try this place again at a later date."}
{"text":"This place is right in my neighborhood, so I feel for some Thai food, I know who to go to. I ordered a ton of food because I had a voucher from restaurant.com that practically cut the prices in half. If you check into the place on Yelp, you can get a free Thai tea. I love how it looks very contemporary and sheik. There's a bar in the center too. The plates and silver wear are set formally as you are seated and cold water already served immediately as you take a look at the menu. At least that was my experience. When they come out with the food, they were all prepared as a presentation for people who love to take photos of their food. My favorite dish was their coconut curry served in a coconut shell with the edible skin still intact. Overall , the place was clean and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Beef Pad Thai level 3, crispy pork, and crispy garlic shrimp, all amazing! Came here on a whim and accidentally found our new fav Thai place. Service was excellent. Restaurant was clean and comfortable. The flavors were so rich and amazing. I'm so full and I'm already planning what I'm going to eat next time!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little place I've been so lucky to go to.  The staff is wonderful and the food is excellent.  I always get the Pad Thai and Tom Kha Soup.  Great and quiet atmosphere, especially after dark.  Couldn't be happier with Thai Thai!"}
{"text":"I came here bec if the reviews and it was Very disappointing. Pad Thai was way too sweet and sticky and seafood tom yum lacked flavor"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm told by waitstaff that this restaurant will be closing today as management will not be renewing the lease. Currently unknown what will replace it. I was never the biggest fan of Thai Thai, but it's never nice to have places close especially when there aren't a lot of similar restaurants in the area.  I'm told the chef will be moving to an existing Thai restaurant on this side of the valley. Will update when confirmed."}
{"text":"So I think the food here is actually really good - 4*, possibly even 4.5*. My favorites are the war wonton soup, the larb, roast duck curry, salmon panang, and the basil seafood plate. Also, the crab fried rice is definitely among the best fried rice dishes I've had anywhere, and I do love my fried rice!  That said, this place has gotten pretty popular especially during lunch hours and the service gets really poor when it's busy (and to be honest, even when it's not busy the service is not great to begin with). Also, the food takes forever at these times... it took more than 30 minutes to get our entrees once. So if it's busy - not a good place if you're not allowed a generous lunch break.  Additionally, one time the salmon was just not fresh at all. We didn't get sick or anything (although granted we didn't eat much of it), but it was just clearly not fresh.  One last thing is that management is very bad about notifying customers when the restaurant will be closed. We basically go every week and we'll still sometimes show up and the place will just be closed, so they're giving minimal notification if any at all. Particularly annoying was the week of Christmas, when they were closed on Monday but the note on the door said they would be open Tuesday and Wednesday, but when we went back on Tuesday they were still closed anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent little elegant Thai restaurant. The food was five stars. I had the Scallops Chu Chee which was amazing and last time I had the Pad See Ew which was also great. The service is also five stars because the girl handling the dining room is friendly, clean and professional. I really appreciate a good place like this. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely I love Thai Food.., and I love this place   This one of the most authentic Thai food I ever had in Las Vegas. I really recommended Thai Thai Restaurant on Eastern cross streets at Sun Ridge Heights.  Their wonderful to present all of Thai food and the taste is amazing! Cute decoration. We really like their Special which was Scallop Chu Chee, Salmon Basil, Grilled Jumbo Squid, Crispy Shrimp and Wowww! !! It was such a flavorful dish. I very love it!   The staffs is friendly and very nice clean restaurant service is good. There are plenty parking spaces.  That's why I would give 5 starts to Thai Thai Restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food. Very spicy, so order lower than normal spice level, or you'll be sorry...:)"}
{"text":"Officially our new favorite Thai restaurant in Henderson/Vegas. We've tried Lotus of Siam (what's all the hype about!?), Pin Kaow (both locations), Krung Siam, Gaati Thai, Siri Thai, Kung Fu, and Archi's. We always order the same thing everywhere we go, so I'm comparing apples to apples...or Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with chicken :)  Thai Thai is intimate and well-decorated. The service is always great and the portions are substantial. Whether you go at lunch or dinnertime, you won't leave hungry! We rarely order dessert at restaurants, but the sticky rice with coconut ice cream is crazy good.   We've been about 6-7 times now, and the food and service have been consistently good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant Recommend it to anyone who loves Authentic Thai food.  Food is delicious as we had Jumbo Shrimp Tom Yum noodle-(Hot and Sour soup with lime juice), Duck Bun-(Serve with Ginger),Coconut curry with seafood -(Shrimp,cat fish,scallop,mussell,octopus),and spicy fatfish. And our sesert was sweet sticky rice with mango.  Everything was fresh,testy, and shot cuts are not taken.  We enjoined everything we had here perfectly spice and excellent service.  We defiantly come back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Quaint ambiance. One of the few places in town that doesn't have gaming or tv screens. A fantastic venu for a date or family dinner. Love it!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple times before over the last 3-4 years and thought the food was good and the staff/owners were trying very hard.  When there before we saw few other customers and the owners were pretty aggressive about encouraging is to get a discount for paying cash and coming back.    At this visit (last week), there were more customers, nobody suggested a cash discount (i.e., they no longer appeared to be desperate for customers), but the food was disappointing.  I had one of the day's specials, a giant shrimp soup.  It looked good but it had a fishy taste to it and the first shrimp I dug into was pretty tough.  I guess that would be expected with shrimp in a hot soup - impossible to just cook it lightly.  One of the other of the 3 shrimp (I'm not complaining about the number - they were truly giant), had similar texture, was maybe a little less tough, and the third was totally mush.  If that was from overcooking, it must have been simmering in the soup broth for days - not likely - and you'd think all three would be the same.  Whatever the reason, yuck.  I didn't eat that one and kind-of lost my appetite for the rest of the soup.  The broth tasted good except for the kind-of fishy smell and there were tons of noodles although they turned to mush the next day in my leftover soup.  Our curry was fine and the Tom Kha soup not bad, but had less flavor than we like.  The restaurant has a rack of wine glasses on the back wall but don't serve wine.  Hmmm.  Bottom line is that there are a lot of Thai restaurants in this area and this one hasn't drawn us away from those we like better."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!!!  We ordered lunch special, salad, soup, small appetizers and main menu.  Cheap and delicious.  We'll come back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is authentic and fresh. The waitress always makes us feel like we are their number one customer. The Thai tea and Thai coffee are always fresh and not watered down."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food i ordered. Nothing was what i thought it would taste like. The fried rice with shrimp was under browned and over cooked and pad see ew with beef was terrible and sweet i didnt understand where they were going with it. And also the tom yum soup was even bad i had to add my own flavors just to make it edible. I wish i could get my 50 bucks back. Potstickers were ok but the sauce was awful."}
{"text":"Such an unexpected surprise! A friend suggested we try this place out. I guess the place has been under new management since his last visit but we were pleasantly overwhelmed with the lunch special deals nonetheless.   There's a weekday and a weekend lunch special, we visited during a weekday. Each lunch special is under $10 and you get a salad, an appetizer, choice of side, and your entree. I THINK. We both ordered a lunch special but were almost full even before our entrees came out.  Wonton soup was nice even on a hot day, standard salad with peanut sauce (still good though), potstickers were plentiful. My yellow curry with tofu was nice and clean at a low spice level haha. Creamy and full of flavor.   I normally make room for dessert but couldn't manage to free any room! I have to come back to try the sticky rice and mango dessert.   Great value and will be back. This place NEEDS to be bookmarked!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area. The duck buns, duck curry, and papaya salad were absolutely stellar. Delivery was quick and convenient. I must try for Thai!   FYI- they do have brown rice available for substitution!"}
{"text":"Had the green chicken curry. Ordered it medium & that was the perfect amount of spice. The actual chicken was skimpy as well as the side of rice."}
{"text":"I have tried this a few times and I've been disappointed.   The Tom yum soup is good.  The beef salad and noodle salad lacked that sour spicy dressing that you want"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and staff. Great pineapple fried rice. Try their milk with green syrup; it's not a popular drink in the US but it definitely is in Thailand. Can't wait to go back there!"}
{"text":"Hands down this the best Thai food I've ever had. The staff is so sweet and the red curry was so yummy!  Can't wait to go back more often to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here once a week, The food is exceptional the service is always great. I always get the garlic pepper chicken and most recently I have tried the potstickers and egg drop soup... they are amazing. I would highly recommend this place and have brought many friends here for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The best thai food in Henderson!! Haven't tasted food this good since leaving Seattle!! The best peanut sauce!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant, flavored food, impeccably clean. The place may be small, but warm/cozy and very welcoming. Very friendly humble service crowning best Thai food around. I discovered it just last week and I have been back for more already. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Intimate place with home style flavor food.  The service is  a bit slow cause they only have one server and chef but the food is with the wait.  The roti with condensed milk was great!"}
{"text":"This small, 32-seat restaurant had only 6 seats occupied on the Tuesday night of our visit. We started off with an order of crab rangoon - fried wontons with a cream cheese and crab filling that was devoid of crab flavor.  For entrees we shared orders of Pad Thai with shrimp that was drowned in too much sauce and the spicy catfish entree that was very good, but again, oversauced."}
{"text":"A great spot for lunch if you're in the area! Located in the shopping center on the corner of Eastern and Sunridge Heights near other wonderful establishments. Their lunch specials are an amazing deal! For $6.95 you receive a bowl of their Soup of the Day, a small salad with choice of dressing, Crispy Roll, and choice of entree. So, lots of food for $7? Yeah. If you're really hungry, they have another lunch special for $9.95 that includes a couple additional items.  We had their Cucumber Soup and It tasty and refreshing! The salad was fresh and I loved the peanut dressing (basically their peanut sauce that would typically accompany satay, which I am addicted to) on it! The Crispy Roll was a fresh and very crispy spring/vegetable roll. For my entree, I chose the Tofu Pad Thai (with level 3 spicy, out of 5). The tofu was fried, not my favorite preparation, but at least it was nicely cooked. The noodles were well-flavored, but overcooked and not my favorite version of the dish. Level 3 was a bit spicy for me, so it was difficult to eat - I'm definitely going with level 2 next time.  Overall, it's not my favorite Thai food in town. It wasn't horrendous and for all the other reasons (insanely cheap!), it might be enticing to return. Service was wonderful and if you pay with cash, they offer 10% off your bill!"}
{"text":"Sadly after many years of enjoying the best Thai food this side of Bangkok, this restaurant has changed owners and worse changed the chef.  The food now at best is mediocre and I will stop patronizing it, despite the location was proximate to where I live.  I will be looking for another Thai restaurant, but I doubt I will find any approaching  the old Thai Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, and this is our first experience since the management change for this restaurant.  I had the pad Thai (no peanuts) and the other two in our party had the som thom thai thai special and at first I thought the portion size was small but it was just an optical illusion of the container. I can't even finish it I'm so stuffed. The flavor on all three orders was good but slightly bland. After adding a small amount of coconut palm sugar it was exactly what it needed. The vegetable portion of the som thum was also missing garlic. They are very generous with the portion of sticky rice. We will definitely order again. :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here.  The food is great, the price is right and the ambiance is is calm and serene.  We've had pineapple curry, pad Thai, Sweet & Sour thai chicken.  All were great.  The mango sticky rice is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The food is greasy now and does not taste fresh. I also found a rock in my egg roll. Disgusting.   Also the last two times I ordered takeout they gave me the wrong food. I will not go back here any time soon."}
{"text":"What a good find. Just happened to drive by but instead of going to Burger Joint next door, I decided to try this place. I Highly recommended it. All the food we ordered was great! The Crab Fried Rice was especially good with REAL crab! Panang Combination Curry was also just as good. Almost addicting. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Just got back to the office after eating here for lunch, and all I have to say is: Wow!  I used to come here every so often before the new ownership, and while it was good then, it is significantly better now. That says a lot too, as I would've considered the restaurant under the old owners to be the best Thai food in Henderson. Now it's at an entirely new level, and completely affirms my opinion that this is the best Thai restaurant in Henderson.  The service was prompt, courteous, and overall just exceptional. The server was kind to me, and made sure that I always had a full glass of water, and offered refills on my Thai tea when it was getting low. And honestly, it got low pretty quickly because of how delicious it was; easily the best Thai tea I've had in a long time, if not ever.   Onto the food: I ordered the yellow chicken curry lunch special at a spiciness level of 9. The lunch special came with the curry loaded with vegetables, steamed rice, an egg roll, and a soup or salad to keep you satisfied during the wait for the food. The soup today was a vegetable and tofu soup, and while simple, was very delicious. The curry was actually spicy, and I want to make this point very clear. Most Thai places will give me something spicy, but not spicy enough, if I ask for a 9 or 10; this place gave me something that was exactly what I had expected when I ordered it. Spicy, flavorful, and filling. The rice that came with the meal was the perfect texture as well, and complemented the curry well. And even the egg roll was great, especially with the sauce that comes with it. It was a perfect meal in every sense of the word. And also just as important, the lunch special prices are incredibly reasonable.  Overall, this place is awesome. As I stated earlier, it is without a doubt the best Thai restaurant in Henderson. I'm definitely coming back, and I highly recommend it. Try it yourself, and I promise you that you won't be anywhere close to disappointed."}
{"text":"OK I gave one more star than it deserves because the food here is just so good!   Normally, if a restaurant offers above average food but below  average customer service, it would not get more than three stars from me.  I think when you go to a sit-down restaurant, the service is equally as important as the quality, but rules are meant to be broken...   I have been here twice and both times they were empty. Once, it was an hour before their closing. The other was a carry-out order at 7pm and not a single table. It worked out great because I ordered on my way to the restaurant and I was there within five minutes and my food was already waiting for me!   The pad see ew (stir fried noodles with Chinese broccoli) is a must try. The flavor and noodle-broccoli ratio are in perfect harmony. The bits and pieces of the scrambled eggs really tie it together. Try it with tofu because their tofu is awesome - not over cooked like most places.   They also have a delicious duck curry. I intend to frequent this place more often and try more of their dishes even though I have to suffer through the one girl that works there who never smiles. In fact, from the look of her face, you'd think you created an inconvenience for her by patronizing her establishment!  And I know for a fact it's not a culture thing because most Thais are extremely friendly!   Side note: since the restaurant hardly has sit-down patrons (I am assuming they stay open with mostly take out orders), this makes for a great restaurant for dates. At least you will both snicker about the rude-looking server and connect on a deeper level with delicious food..."}
{"text":"Although the place is under new management now, I recall coming to this place when it was Pat Thai and not feeling like it stood out. It still really doesn't to me. I had the chicken cashew and chicken satay. Both were legit, but I'm not over the moon about it. The chicken cashew didn't have very good quality chicken and was packed full of veggies that I don't care for. Baby corns. Who eats baby corns? Not my fave, but I have to give them props on the thai tea. It was legit."}
{"text":"New owners. Tightened up the atmosphere. Do feel the spicy chicken cashew lunch special i frequented and loved is not as good as it once was. Used to have red rice. Specials are still a huge value though. 8 bucks etc. Not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Was wondering what to eat for lunch one day and was suggested I try Thai Thai.  It's a newer Thai restaurant located at the corner of Sunridge Heights and Eastern, in Henderson, NV.  Ordered 2 different lunch specials, yellow curry with tofu, and red curry with chicken (medium spiciness).  Both curries were exceptionally made but the red curry was so delicious, it had just the perfect amount of spiciness with each bite.  The $6.95 lunch special came with rice, a salad, egg roll, and supposedly a free drink.  We had ordered take-out and the drinks were not packaged with the rest of the meal.  A slight disappointment but not something that would prevent me from coming back again to try other dishes.  Will be back for sure to dine-in and see what else this restaurant has to offer.  In my book its off to a good start in an area deficient of good asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow!  Really enjoyed this place. I have come a few times before to this place when it was under different management.  Back then. I would give the place a solid 3 star.  I would come because it was close.   Today under new management I give the place a 5 star rating!  Everything here is on a scale of 1-10 spice. But the waitress warned it is really hot.   Service is great, presentation outstanding and the food is very very good.   We had yellow curry with sliced chicken, spicy eggplant with ground  pork,  pad kee mao and basil with ground chicken.   I find that when a Thai place can do their meats ground, it adds to the flavor and texture. Some places will only do ground pork. Here they did the chicken for me too.   We ordered everything at level 1 except the basil at a level 7.  They also brought out slices for me if I wanted it hotter.   Everyone has to try this place. It was great in all aspects."}
{"text":"I wanted I try this place as I got their low priced menu in the menu and more importantly I wanted to try something other than my fav place Siri Thai!    1.  I was impressed that the first part of the menu had steamed fish with ginger and onions. Very hard to find I. The burbs! -  4 star  2.  There is a great combination of Thai food and also chinese food, so a nice flexible menu.  Let's face it, some are turned off by the heat / spice of the Thai food. - 4 star  3.  Service - Very nice and family style - 4 star  4.  Ambiance - New, low light, clean, plenty of room. Tables kinda small. That made it a bit uncomfortable.  Nowhere to put all the stuff like your keys, glasses, phone and all.  OK, I guess I have to buy a man purse? Overall very nice. 3 star  5.  Food - Not bad at all.  I would say that it is pretty darn good, perhaps not exactly memorable, but just pretty good.  I will be going back to try more.-  3  star  GK says, I am going back to this place to try out the diverse menu a bit.  Just right now cannot think of anything that is like calling my name...."}
{"text":"The cashiers are not trained to give customers the perka code on the receipt. They just throw it away. Missing out on building repeat customers. Good is good."}
{"text":"Favorite little Thai place in Henderson! I come here almost every Monday around 2-3 and it is always excellent.   The great thing is that the food always tastes so fresh. There is usually only the same one waitress but she Is very kind and quick.   Spice is true to #."}
{"text":"This place was extremely mediocre.  The sea bass with garlic was cooked perfectly, sadly the accompanying sauce tasted completely undoctored and out of a jar. Other Thai restaurants have fresh chopped garlic and chilies to liven up the dish and this is what I presumed I would be getting (have eaten Thai style garlic seafood 5 dozen times). It wasn't bad, just wasn't authentic.  The garlic shrimp had a too thick almost tempura batter. The only thing garlicky was the dipping sauce. Again, a little disappointed. Not like what they serve elsewhere or in Thailand.  The pad Thai was also mediocre. The sauce and noodles reminded me of the Thai Kitchen brand noodles and sauce that you can make in 5 minutes at home. I love pad Thai when done well, this just wasn't it. There was also no flavor of any fish sauce being used which is a key ingredient in making pad Thai.  On a bright note, the service was friendly although there was only one waitress in the entire restaurant. Once she had five tables, things slowed a bit but not her fault...  Overall, if you are inexperienced with Thai cuisine this place could easily satisfy you...I know for myself better options exist and I won't return."}
{"text":"I can't even get over how fresh and good quality this Thai food is. We've tried countless places in the area for take out and found some decent places ... But there was always something not quite right. Thai Thai is on point. It's not greasy. Super fresh and downright delicious. Love that they have the order online option for delivery."}
{"text":"Great food ! Excellent service! This place is a hidden gem ! Give it a try and you will love this place"}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the old management.  they have a new cook, higher prices and the food is below average.  they no longer give a discount for cash either.  i'm sad"}
{"text":"Sadly,  this establishment has changed owners.  With that change, there is a new cook, they no longer give a 10% for cash, the prices have gone up and the food is mediocre.  there is no reason to make a special trip here anymore.  I'll have to find a new place:-("}
{"text":"Going back today for a friends birthday food great service excellent a true sleeper Erica Hamilton"}
{"text":"Just ordered for the first time . I am sure it will be the last. I ordered tom ka soup which was meh. Had a really weird chewy vegetable in it and was kind of watered down. Also ordered tofu pad Thai it was inedible. I took one bite and spit it out it was sooooo fishy tasting. The tofu wasn't too bad  I tried that first. But the noodles ewwww. $25 dollars in the trash. Yuck! So angry I spent that much on garbage"}
{"text":"We love love LOVE Thai food. This place delivers every time. Every single time. The curry is crazy good! The spice and flavors are magnificent all the times we order. We love the soups, the red curry and the crab ragoon!!! This place is AMAZING!!!! Try it, you won't regret it!! So good....."}
{"text":"I can say for certain that Thai Thai has definitely fixed any minor issues I had before. It has gotten so much better that I don't go anywhere else for Thai! There's really no point because not only is the food always fresh and tasty, but they haven't messed up an order in who knows how long. The person who answers the phone now speaks English just fine and they're always pleasant. They even remember my husband. Most of the dishes are roughly $8-9, depending on what meat you choose.  TIP: if you order over $20 worth of food they give free egg rolls. Over $40 they give an entire box of free chicken fried rice that actually tastes really good. Over $50 they give you a free order of shrimp tempura. I also believe that if you pay cash they take 10% off (not certain since I always use a card)."}
{"text":"This location has been changed owner many times. I used to come here and tried this restaurant. I had a lunch here. Food was so so. Small portion with uncooked potatoes. I've been many Thai restaurants  here in Henderson. This is worst one I know. This is closest my house, but I'll never back."}
{"text":"This place is very close from my house.We've been many times.We like to go for lunch.It's reasonable and good enough to come back.We tried many dishes in the past and most are tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered pad see ew, pad Thai, friend shrimp spring rolls, and wontons. The wontons were decent kind of fishy. They didn't give us our spring roll, and the pad see ew and pad thai was only spicy. It had no other flavor. It was flavorless noodles. I wanted to like it but it was not good & I'll never go back."}
{"text":"NASTY NASTY NASTY!!! don't order the coconut shrimp, there is no coconut!!! It's just breaded shrimp!! The duck curry is watery, and the green curry tastes like an old man!!! Eww I added scallops, bad move!!! Rubber!! For $11!!! And its pretty hard to mess up crab Rangoon, they did!! Tastes like undercooked wonton wrapper... I wasted $70!!!"}
{"text":"Service has gone way downhill. The food is just ordinary where it used to be outstanding. Delivery used to be rather quick and now it's an abnormally long wait."}
{"text":"Food was quite tasty. We ordered:  Tom Yum Seafood Soup - $16.95 Fried Tofu - $6.95 Chicken Pad Thai - $9.95  The soup was well done but a bit overpriced for what it was.   The fried tofu was about perfect with a tasty dipping sauce that was just a bit too sweet.  The Pad Thai was delicious and there was nothing to complain about.    The place is tiny but cozy.  10 tables or so but clean and tidy.   The service was adequate but a little slow.  The soup arrived less than a minute after the fried tofu appetizer.  The timing should have been better but we adjusted.    If you like Thai food this place is worth a visit if you are in the Henderson area.  I would not go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Went here on a whim after a hike and stumbled upon this gem. This might be the best Thai food I've ever had.   Ordered the Massamon Curry and the Beef Pad See Ew. Also tried the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and the House Fried Rice. Everything was DELICIOUS. Seriously. The curry was super flavorful, the noodles were chewy and yummy, and everything had the perfect amount of heat. I'd recommend the Massamon Curry and the Pad See Ew forsure. The portions are huge too!  Definitely a little hole-in-the-wall place that serves amazing Thai food. Don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Food: $7.95 lunch special, chicken red curry (mild) with salad and it comes with an egg roll. Hubby had the chicken pad thai with soup. I thought the pad thai was just ok and I would not order it in the future, but I really enjoyed the red curry, it was similar to pagang curry which is my go-to, but they didn't have that on the lunch special.The vegetables were very fresh and crispy and the salad was a large portion with a very fresh ginger dressing.  Ambiance: Traditional, casual, but some weird quirks. Their placements belong in an Italian restaurant and the dish they used for the egg roll sauce was a shot glass with some sports team for North Carolina. Totally bizarre - like how hard is it to get a little dish? Literally no one was in there as lunch, we were the only customer for a while so I was getting worried, but as we ended our meal, the tables started to fill and they get a fair amount of to-go orders.  Service: One waitress (possibly the owner), so it may be a bit slower at times when business picks up.  Location: this is super convenient to me located in the same plaza as Kumon and Lazy Dog Grooming.   Will put this in the rotation! And would like to try dinner to experience more dishes."}
{"text":"Great Curry. Too bad they charge $2.50 extra for a 4oz portion of brown rice. Not a side order just subbing for white rice.Sorry not justified. Could have been five stars, and I won't be back. My bill was $13.44 for tofu and curry and rice."}
{"text":"I ordered the bean curd noodles and pond soup with tofu.  I'm not a vegetarian but need a break occasionally with crisp, clean food.  They really need to clean the pans and friers more often;  everything tastes like old fish.  Throwing out $30 of disgusting food."}
{"text":"I got delivery. Pretty good food. I also got the fresh rolls and while they were good... I gotta say I've never had strawberry slices in them before. I'll order again."}
{"text":"Their lunch special is legit, prices and service are excellent! My favorite place to recharge on some really good food when out running errands."}
{"text":"After working a full day outside at WOC, I went to Thai Thai Restaurant and was so pleasantly surprised.  I started with the Tom Kha Kai soup (which is one of my favs) - the broth was so flavorful; the mushrooms weren't overcooked, they were wonderful and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  I opted for a level 2 for spice and I could have done 4, I think.  The pad thai was amazing.  Check in with Yelp and get a Thai Iced Tea -- which was great."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Food takes a while to come out. Thai iced tea isn't that good and so as the pad Thai. Both lacks flavor.  Beef rad nah is on point. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"5 stars for packaging in recyclable, to-go plastic containers.  Then it's just downhill from here... The Thai ice tea was way too sweet and I could hardly tasted any of the tea in the sugar drink. This was pre- mixed, so lowering the sugar was not an option. The only upside is check in on Yelp and get it for free, because it's going right down the drain.   The pad see ew had no hint of sweetness or spice and nothing but salt. The chicken breast were great, but the soy sauce level needed to be dialed back.  I did enjoy that they used Chinese broccoli, but some pieces had inedible stalk.   The average dish is about $10, I'll gladly pay more at Gaati Thai for a much more satisfying and authentic Thai meal."}
{"text":"Probably my 2nd favorite Thai restaurant in town. A few of my favorites are the Pad Thai, Red/Yellow Curry, and their Thai tea. The food is so flavorful and the prices are great. The lunch combos are around $6-8 and come with a choice of a salad, appetizer, and entree. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"What is up with all the hype? It definitely was not all it was cracked out to be. First and foremost when we get there, there was hardly any customers and the server could not even greet us or get us seated? I think the menu was a bit pricy and when we got the food, it wasn't great, i would rate it at barely edible...not even worth taking it home in a doggy bag. If you are craving thai food, you are better off hauling your stomach to Pin Kaow or Archies, better atmosphere, better service, better food. Sorry... I just have to be brutally honest."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Such great flavoring to the dishes. The restaurant is cutely decorated and the music playing is very relaxing and current."}
{"text":"Quaint, cute, quiet and  delicious . Green curry is amazing! Go low on your spice number even 4 is hot. Crispy tofu is perfection with flavorful seasoning . Lee the waitress will take great care of you and you will want to come back again and again. A must try!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in the valley! I worked at one of the best Thai restaurants back home on Guam so it's been quite a journey to find a place that can even begin to compare. Their curry was without a doubt delectable and after speaking with the owner it was confirmed that it's all about the coconut milk. The service was AWESOME as well! I have definitely found my go to spot for Thai food. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu. =)"}
