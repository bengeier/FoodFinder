{"text":"We were walking at 6 in the evening last June 21 from Marriott Grand Chateau to MGM Grand to watch Ka, while keeping an eye for dinner possibilities. The temperature was sizzling at 46 degrees celsius. Passing a row of establishments, in a hurry to get out of the oppressive heat, a glass door swings open and the loud and cheery \"Come in! Come in! Very hot outside!\" wafted to us. Seeing it was an oriental restaurant, we entered and were promptly seated. The staff looked solicitous and attentive to our party of 8. Sadly, our very nice experience ended there. 

The food that eventually came either fell short of the taste we were expecting, or tasted off or odd, or was too greasy and overcooked. We wanted so much to like the place because of the friendly staff. But, there is just no getting over the bad food. Sorry. 

Would have given at least 2 stars, but when our bill came we were amazed at the large gratuity already added to our bill. We found the place overpriced compared to the oriental restaurant we went to in San Francisco, considering the size of the servings, the quality of the ingredients, the execution and the taste. Not recommended, so sorry."}

{"text":"Very bad experience, I ordered bubble milk tea which was $3.99 with ahhhhhhhhhh taste, but the final price was $5.6 with extra $1 for bubble, so tricky. The noodle was fxxx gross, never come back again."}
{"text":"Really bad service and food. I ordered the duck noodle soup and one cup bubble milk tea. The noodle soup is bad taste And the milk tea is much over price. The bubble tea is just like water. The boss is dishonest and charged us 20 percent more tips without our permit. I will never come again."}

{"text":"The food was good. We ordered the House Noodles and dim sum:  Shu Mai and the Har Gow shrimp (not sure of the spelling). Everything was really good. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The food was fresh and tasty - the House Nodles came with chicken and shrimp, and the chicken didn't have the yucky chicken-y taste I hate. The dim sum was very fresh and tasty - didn't taste frozen at all. I also had Thai tea, which wasn't overly sweet."}
{"text":"I'm rating this 4 stars because it is pricey. I could get the same thing off of the strip for $8- as apposed to $14- but hey, it's the strip. Only place around my work that I can get something vegetarian. This is my second visit here getting the same thing. I'm sure all of the food is pretty consistent. They are quick at lunch. Not sure about dinner. They charge 50c for using the credit card machine. Everything seemed clean in dining room."}
{"text":"I really wish I hadn't had to Google this place as that's when I found all of the bad news about it. The other reviews are right: you're probably better off spending your money elsewhere.

Truthfully, the food wasn't bad. It wasn't good, but I didn't get sick from it, which is something I look for in a dining establishment. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and a Bubble Tea. I found the Ma Po Tofu to be pretty average and the bubble tea to be sub par due to the overcooked tapioca pearls. My dining companion ordered the General Tso's Chicken. She seemed to be pleased with her food. We definitely overpaid for it, but didn't much care until we got home. Our receipt wasn't itemized so it was hard to figure out the cost of each item. I Googled this place hoping to find the menu and the prices, but I was greeted with news about it just about failing an inspection from the Health Department at the tail end of last year (gulp!). I called the place to get the prices of our items and, after several phone calls were disconnected, I got through. I had to use some chicanery to get the prices. There's still about $5 unaccounted for. 

Lesson learned. I feel like getting away with my health and slight disappointment in what could've been a truly awful situation is worth the $5 mystery fee. I just don't plan on ever returning."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. It's super expensive and food is really bad. The waiter added tips for a 2-person meal automatically and a plain noodle soup became $15 each after he included tea and services."}
{"text":"I'd like to recommend this restaurant, especially its spicy dishes! The Szechuan flavor is authentic! Try!"}
{"text":"Horrible food!
I don't know how much soy sauce they put into the food, but it's absolutely disgusting. The place is very dirty, probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever seen. The place has no waitresses and the meat was cold and raw when I first got it! Absolutely unacceptable for a basic Chinese restaurant. Very disappointed in the food, but also super slow service due to lack of workers."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good Chinese food at a reasonable price.  I had the Mongolian Beef with a bowl of rice and a watermelon drink.  The meal was served very quickly and the meal was excellent and reasonably priced.  

The wait staff seemed very friendly and eager to please"}
{"text":"Horrible service. It took forever for them to get my order and bring my food out. Tasteless Thai tea with no straw. Noodle soups with no chopsticks (sure they thought we could eat noodles with a spoon). No napkins. Whenever I asked for those, they said ok and never brought them out. I had to went to the counter to ask for it. The owner had an attitude. Tasteless food."}
{"text":"ONE OF VEGAS'S HIDDEN GEMS!

The food here was fantastic! AUTHENTIC FOOD! If you are not a big food adventurer you might not enjoy the food here. People who enjoy fusion or Americanized cuisine find it hard to appreciate food that look different form what they are used to. THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL/LOCAL TAKE OUT! 

This place definitely hit the spot on my way in. WORTH EVERY PENNY! The food is cooked and served family style so one dish can feed two if you wanted but with the variety on the menu you won't just order one item. 

MUST ORDER THE TRADITIONAL NOODLE DISH! 

Keep in mind they include your tip at the end of the bill so don't worry about tipping."}
{"text":"WARNING! DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE! DISHONEST AND BAD SERVICE! ???????????
I usually do not rant on Yelp. But people should be alert of this kind of shitty service and not give your money away. 

We visited on Dec 20th evening, I wasn't even planning to eat here, just walking pass-by and saw the board outside says milk bubble tea in Chinese. It was late in the evening, and a bit chilly so I decided to get a cup of warm bubble tea. 

5 minutes after I ordered a hot milk tea with bubble, I couldn't believe I was still engaged in conversation with the owner. It goes like this: 
Me: I want a hot milk tea.
Owner: Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes.
Owner: Do you want it hot or cold?
Me: Hot, do you serve hot?
Owner: Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..
Me: (interrupts) so do you make it hot?
Owner: If you insist, I can make it hot..but most people want it cold you know. Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes. How much is it?(taking my money out)
Owner: it's 75cents extra with bubbles, so 5.75 without bubble, and 6.5 with bubbles.
Me: (not happy with this overpriced tea, but it's tourism area, so i put my money on the table), ok, i want a hot milk tea with bubbles.
Owner: so you still want it hot?

Back to where we began!! And while conversing, some customers entered, so this owner just left in the middle of our conversation and turned to attend those new customers who apparently wanted to dine(so potentially worth more money than me), i've never experienced server this rude. Btw, the restaurant was pretty much empty. They had at least 3 servers out including the owner, so he didn't have to attend to those customers.

Meanwhile, another server who was pouring tea (yes they do have a hot teapot I saw that) behind the counter, asked the owner what I wanted in Chinese. I can understand them the whole time, it basically went \"ok, what does she want? she wants milk tea, hot\"(very impatiently). I asked my last question: \"so do you serve hot milk tea or not??\", owner again murmured: \"Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..but if you insist i can make hot\". OMFGGGG, it's a matter of 6 dollars, if you can not offer what you say you can, just DON'T SAY YOU OFFER IT! 

So 15 minutes of unpleasant conversations and wait later, I stormed out without milk tea.  And did I mention that on their milk tea menu on the wall, there was no price at all?? Obviously they like to charge whatever price they have for ya. It's a shame that they try to fool tourists especially Chinese tourists. I didn't pay anything in the end, but I believe other reviewers were right about them adding extra for tip. Of course they will.

{"text":"Good authentic food, no MSG, no super salt/sugary stuff, fresh ingredients.  More like a mom&pop place but located right on prime spot on the strip. Hours on Yelp are not entirely accurate.   Service was decent when we were there (the first people ordering)."}
{"text":"Humble and straightforward place with well-prepared food. Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge. Although the decor and half-empty beverage fridge are a bit underwhelming, the place is spacious and clean. I really enjoyed the the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"The chicken chow mein is very oily, and the chicken smells old. The beef noodle soup had very little beef and bok choy. The cod filet was mildly flavorful but bathing in oil. The shrimps were miniature and salty. The taro and mango boba slushes were mostly ice and used powder. The pork dumplings were disgusting; they smelled really bad and were probably the worst item we ordered. Service was alright. The restaurant had a gloomy, cafeteria-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was tired and hungry from walking on the Las Vegas Strips. So I walked in to this restaurant.  
The waitress seated me and gave me a menu. She asked me if I would like some hot tea and I replied her sure. I order the spicy taiwanese noodle soup.
The noodle was ok but my soup was no right. I wanted spicy but the soup was sweet and unappetizing. I only eat half of it and ask for my bill.
When my bill came I was so shocked that it was more then I estimated. She charged me $4 for the tea she offered me. She also added the gratuity in my bill.
This place is crooked. They want to robed from their customers. I'm not coming back anymore.!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I was hungry from walking the Vegas Strips all day. She wanted some Asian cuisine. We saw a sign outside that said boba ice tea. 
When we walked in the restaurant, it was completely empty. I though maybe they were closed. But soon we was greeted by a waitress with some menu. 
After reading the menu, my wife order the Taiwan noodle soup and a pot of hot tea. I order the chicken pad thai and a boba milk tea. 
My wife said her noodle was nice and chewy, but the soup was just ok. I was surprise as well, my pad thai was ok also considering being made in a chinese restaurant.
We finished our meal and ask for our bill. But the bill was written in chinese, we couldn't read it. The total was way more then what we had figured.
We were in a rush so we pay the bill and left her a tip.
When we came back to our hotel, we were curious about our bill. We study it and we were shocked and angry that they charged us for the hot tea and they included the gratuity in our bill without telling us.
This is the last time we would ever come to eat at this restaurant ever again.!!!"}
{"text":"Scam alert!!!!! Hidden fees and charges for sub par food. Do not eat here!!! Charged over $50 for salt and pepper squid, king pao chicken, 4 small bowls of rice, and 3 bubble teas one of which was buy one get one free. 

 Was supposed to be around $35 don't know where that extra $15 added fees came from.  Charged gratuity for no matter the size of the party. He was very rude when we asked about the bill. 

Worse dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's really good Chinese food! ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????Nice??????"}
{"text":"This place is bizarre.

We walked in, and after we got the menus and were about to order, the waiter told us that we really should be ordering from \"the Chinese menu.\" We said what menu, and turns out there was a sign by the cash register (which was quite far away from us) with speciality items listed in Chinese. This resulted in this weird back and forth dance that we had to do to go back and read the Chinese menu there.

We ordered some dishes, and overall they were decent but generally not worth the money.

The dry cooked green beans were really delicious. The sauce was on point, and it was so flavorful. I couldn't stop eating these, and my sister agreed that this dish was really good.

The spicy wontons were a bit of a letdown. The inside of the wonton tasted funny, not enough meat or something. The sauce also just tasted like soy sauce and wasn't that spicy or flavorful.

The bubble tea tasted like powdered tea. The tapioca was also really hard. They also gave it to you in a plastic hard cup (not like the disposable ones you normally get at bubble tea shops) so the presentation was off. It was also really expensive, like $5+ for a mediocre drink.

We ate some other food but it's late and I forgot the exact dishes, so I'll write them in later when I remember.

When we got the bill, we were shocked for it to be $70 for four people. I'd also like to note that THEY AUTOMATICALLY ADD GRATUITY TO THE BILL even if you have a party of four. They don't make any mention of this until you get the bill. There was barely any service either!

I was incredibly turned off by the service here and how expensive the food was given the quality of it. Normally I would give these types of places 3 stars, but I'm knocking it to 2."}
{"text":"They charged us gratitude fee in force! But didn't provide so much service to us! Feel so angry about this! never come again! And never recommend to our friends!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Chinese food and stumbled upon this place by accident.  Great location and prices.  Portions are large and food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a total ripoff. The prices are ridiculously 3X more expensive then other restaurants outside the Vegas strip. Food is mediocre. They just add the gratuity amount on the bill in Chinese and expected my wife to give the waiter tips"}
{"text":"The food smell like fecal matter, skip this place I order a simple beef and broccoli, carry out order and the beef had a smell I can only describe it smell like rancid  disgusting. I was already home so I just trow it in the trash and eat a ham sandwich"}
{"text":"Located in the Hawaiian Marketplace off the Las Vegas strip. Ordered Boba here. Just okay. Very overly-attentive staff right when we walked in. Otherwise, staff is friendly. Boba over priced in our opinion. $3.95 turned into $6.00 somehow. 

Will stop by in a pinch if it gets too hot walking on the strip! They have AC. 

3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant was advertised by being voted the best casual Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. The votes must have come from the \"Tasteless Buds Society\" convention, because anybody who has eaten half-decent Chinese food would involuntarily regurgitate this food. Our order was wonton soup, chili shrimp/pork wonton appetizers, hot tea and Thai iced tea. Cost before tip: $28.76 and the waiter said he's supposed to add on a service charge, but I guess because he saw a 3/4 full bowl of bland tasting wonton soup that was served luke warm with 1 piece  bok choy, 2 nasty tasting wonton and dilapidated noodles and a full plate of the chili shrimp/pork wonton (5) appetizers, with the exception of 1 that had been chewed on and spit out, he decided to be generous and omit the service charge. What I thought was the normal triangular shaped fried wonton was actually the wonton used in the soup with some chili sauce poured over it. Needless to say, we left this restaurant hungry, disappointed and out $31.00!"}
{"text":"Not very honest about the bill, my granddad went there last week. He is not fluent in English and was his first time in Vegas. When the bill came, he asked what that $8.10 was for (see photo), it's written SER - Service charge. They explained to my granddad ( in Chinese) that's state tax, and the  $ 4.05 (in addition) is Sales Tax. So my grand tip them another $8. See photos."}
{"text":"My mom and I shared the Chicken Noodle soup and it was SO good! When we got it, it was at THE perfect temperature (wasn't too not and not too cold). And the fact that my mom really enjoyed it too is amazing because she is VERY picky with soups so the fact that she really liked it tells a lot in my opinion. Also, they were really nice and gave her extra broth to take home with her."}
{"text":"The place was dead on a Thursday afternoon, which scared me a bit, but I was feeling like some Asian food. We ordered the chicken low mein and BBQ pork buns. We were literally the only people there so the food came out pretty quickly. The low mein was  bland. I had to add soy sauce to it to give it some flavor. The pork buns were mushy. The texture was kind of weird, but the taste was good. For the location, I thought there would at least be some other patrons, but seemed odd that no one else was there. Maybe they would work on advertising to get more people into their restaurant."}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food with ehhhhhhhh taste.  I ordered a scallion pancake, and there were about 10 or less scallion flakes used.  Usual scallion pancakes, the scallions are all over... with the one here... you need a microscope to see.  I also ordered a wonton noodle.  Nothing special.  My friends' meals were pretty bad as well.  Never again.  Do yourself a favor, drive off the strip if you want better Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"The owner is very dishonest and added 18% service charge on top of my food bill and state tax. You have to review the bill then pay, or double tips."}
{"text":"The food is okay but a bit oily.  The food is priced higher ($10+ per dish) than your normal takeout restaurant.  They are charging prices akin to a larger dim sum restaurant but the food quality is not exactly comparable.  Plus there are extra fees that they would add to your bill.

Be warned, they will charge you extra $1.50 for rice which was not included in the Kung Pao chicken that we ordered, $2.95 for hot tea (read the menu carefully), and add gratuity to your bill. The other reviews are correct with this respect.

This place deserves one star but I am giving an extra star because the waiter seemed attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great. Right on the strip with good prices and tasty food. Can you ask for much more!? It's not even fast food but authentic Chinese.  I just got some dinner with my husband for $11 a dish each.  That's a bargain in this area. As an additional plus the women owner is super friendly and welcoming. I read a review below about weird extra charges on the bill so I double checked and it's absolutely correct with the menu price plus the standard 8% Las Vegas food tax. No issues here.

I recommend!"}
{"text":"To expensive for subpar Chinese food. Bill came to $65.40 for fried rice,  chicken noodle soup,  and salted  pepper shrimp, two tea drinks and a coke. Waiters and waitresses are aggressively trying to get people inside to eat. If you look at the menu outside, they'll literally run outside to try and convince you their food is good. Two came out at different times to try and make us go inside. We told them we were going to just get it to go but they insisted to come in and sit down. They don't tell you the tip is already included in the bill even though we're only a party of 3. While we sat inside, it was almost comical watching them run outside to pressure people outside that were looking at their menu. Don't go in. If anything, leave and come back several times to get them tired from running out to pursue you. Watch how fast they run."}
{"text":"Very good food and service!
Tasty and comfortable.
We enjoyed and we will come again."}
{"text":"I was so surprised when I got the check. Never ever again go to this restaurant again, even I'm a Chinese."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad at all. It was just overpriced. We had the General Taos and Sesame Chicken. Chicken was moist. Flavorful with the right balance of sauce. Pieces could have been bigger for the prices that were asked. My mother had the Taiwanese Noodle Soup. That was very flavorful. The rice noodles were cooked well. The beef was succulent and flavorful. Fall off the bone moist. Only reason why I gave it those place three stars was because of the prices and the dull atmosphere. A service was as expected."}
{"text":"This is a good place for relatively cheap,  good, hole in the wall authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"It was a decent fix for authentic Chinese. I was surprised that the soup had vermicelli instead of yellow egg noodles typically used in wonton noodle soup and there were just three little wontons. The soup base was tasty. The fried rice had ample ingredients though it was a little heavy on the oil for my preference. Washing it down with a bottle of Tsing Tao and some hot tea did help my homesickness."}
{"text":"TL:DR: Avoid this place at all costs if you care for your wallet or hold standards of any kind for customer service, food quality, or honesty. 

-------

Our party of 3 was lulled in by a sign advertising a 2 for 1 promotion on Boba.  When picking out drinks, we were told the promotion actually only applied to their Longan tea.  Okay, looks like the sign misled us, but we would go ahead and try it anyway. We ended up ordering a beef noodle platter, a bokchoi dish, some servings of rice, the two longan teas, a Boba, and a lychee slush. 

Hungry as we were, the beef noodle platter and bokchoi dishes were just barely passable, if not too oily.  The noodles were a bit stiff and starchy.  Overall the portions were remarkably disappointing given the hefty price. 

The drinks, however, were absolutely unacceptable. I love milk tea and am normally generous with my Boba standards, but Ru Yi managed to serve drinks so egregiously insulting that we actually had to send them back. 

All drinks were loaded to the brim with sugar and ice. The Boba tasted like powder and the pearls were dry, starchy, and long overdue. The two longan teas might as well have been giant glasses of honey water mixed with ice.  They were all served in plastic coke cups, leaving much to be desired in presentation. Not that presentation is a deal breaker, but they literally have a standard Boba tea cup sealer machine in the kitchen in plain sight and decided not to use it, because we didn't order to go.

At least our meal would be easy on the wallet, right? Wrong. 

My jaw dropped when the waitress brought to us a $53 bill, on which she had already factored in her own gratuity charge of $7 (the nerve!), for a meal you could find on any dirty street in the slums of China without the absurd overcharges.

We felt compelled to have them reexamine the service and quality of food they offered, and ended up coming to terms with \"only\" shelling out $40 for the pathetic excuse of a meal that they have the nerve to serve people.

THE VERDICT: With mediocre food, horrid drinks, an overpriced menu, and dishonest service, I found Ru Yi's lack of integrity and (lack of) commitment to standards of any kind, to be an utterly disappointing experience. Please don't waste your lunch on the Las Vegas strip at this dump."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 7. No one was in here so my boyfriend and I were kind of worried. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the food. We ordered a beef pho, Taiwanese spicy noodle soup, bbq pork bun and a strawberry boba tea and all was good. 

beef pho was good, not too much meat though. Pork buns were tiny but still delicious. The boba is more like a slushy, just FYI. It was ok. Least favorite the of the order. The Taiwanese noodle was the best thing we ordered. I recommend trying this if you come. It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy! It worked so well my boyfriend and I ending having  to share the dish!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Good food for the price, considering it's on the strip. Waitress came by often. Pretty solid. Theres2far worse service you'll find on the strip thats for sure."}
{"text":"The noodles were extremely good in the soup I ordered. That's huge for me. The decor leaves a lot to be desired but I liked the place anyway and will return. They asked me if I wanted \"a drink\" when I went in and I said \"no\" based on what I read in the reviews about getting charged for tea. They brought me a glass of water which was exactly what I wanted. I did not receive a service charge, just the bill for the soup. Maybe they include the gratuity for groups. Yes it's a a couple bucks more than other places, but it's on the strip. I did not want to get in a taxi, just wanted a bowl of soup. Perfect for that and cheaper than a taxi. I see more noodles in my future."}
