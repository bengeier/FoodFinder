{"text":"Was greeted with a FREE freshly made donut! I can't really say anything about Krispy Kreme since every single human being loves this awesome place! Thanks for being a part of our lives!!! Doctors should prescribe Krispy Kreme for patients with depression since every bite of their donut gives you joy! Thanks to Dawn & Deanna for their hospitable service! Great crew!"}
{"text":"Bummed I didn't read the reviews prior to making the drive, this is not the real deal. The original glazed seemed like a store bought donut put in the microwave. I'm giving +1 because the iced coffee wasn't bad - however their large iced is smaller than a Dunkin' medium iced."}
{"text":"Decent doughnuts, coffee is strong as hell! I drank one and a half cups and was up all of the following night! :-)"}
{"text":"When I called to get information about store hours employee sounded like he was laughing at me.. and told me that the hours were on the website... which I looked on the website first but the page said not found. I found him to be extremely rude."}
{"text":"Only cockroaches and KK can withstand a nuclear bomb.

Anyway, odd experience. Teenage lovers arguing in the parking lot and in the doorway. 
No greetings from any of the 3 employees there tonight.
Donuts must have been sitting for hours and hours yet still tasted fresh.
Dozen donuts, 1 milk and 1 water was $13 and change."}
{"text":"I would definitely not recommended this donut location to anyone I know.I'm very disappointed with the customer service I received on my very first and last visit to be."}
{"text":"The customer service here is ridiculous. We pulled up to the drive thru and all the guy said was \"what can I get you?\" Naturally since we had 4 people in the car I asked if we could please have a second and he said yes. 
After figuring out what we wanted, I started ordering. First, they didn't have the Easter ones.... Why advertise if you don't have them. Second, he was being short and rude with me. 
We pulled up to the window and he gave me my total and then gave me the donuts. I had also asked for a drink, which he did not give me nor charge me for. Then he walked away from the window and started talking to what I'm assuming was his coworker. I was irritated so I just left. 
When we got home I was so excited to eat these donuts! Too bad he completely messed up the order. I asked for 2 custard filled, he gave me 1 whipped creme filled. I asked for 3 sprinkles donuts, he gave me 3 chocolate glazed. Thank god the rest that I asked for were original glazed because I'm sure he would've messes those up too! 
If you're going to work in customer service, 1. Make sure you pay attention when people ask for something. And 2. BE NICE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. 
I don't think I would've been as mad if he at least got me my custard doughnuts. 
If I could give them less than a star, I would."}
{"text":"Serve reheated donuts as \"fresh\" when the hot now light is on. Not worth the cost when you get dry, old donuts."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Like the drive-thru option.  Fun to watch the donuts being made through the big glass window.

My very favorite is their simple glazed, especially when fresh, within a couple of hours of their creation.  When you come in, you get a free one of those, and I always buy more :)  Their coffee is tasty."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are delicious and very well priced! You can see the yummy confectionery being made and buy from the comfort of your car! What's not to like?"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this is definately the place for you!


 Although I have to say I havent got a sweet tooth particularly, and have found most doughnuts of the various types nice but far too sweet. It is also quite pricey and I hear that in America they are much cheaper!


 I do however LOVE the original glazed doughnut, its just lovely- the glaznig is very light and doughnut has a good fresh flavour, which is perfect in terms of sweetness, so its very satifying for my quick sugar fix!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a good experience at all! The girl who took my order in the drive through, Sarah, was very rude. She couldn't hear me well and said \"whatttt\" instead of \"I'm sorry, what's that?\" Or \"can u speak louder\". When I got my \"hot original Kreme latte\" it was cold! Like not even room temperature, just cold! But served in the proper cup for supposed got drinks. The donuts weren't fresh, weird for a Krispy Kreme. Won't go back."}
{"text":"So sad @krispykreme I remember the time when you bought warm and fresh donuts..not today at Main & Dobson Road (Mesa Arizona) location. 84 year old dad very disappointed after buying an entire dozen. We will try the other location by the Superstition Mall. 
Two stars are given in this review because the Krispy Kreme employee was very nice."}
{"text":"Warning: don't venture into this place unless you've got either a very empty stomach or incredible self-control!!! Krpsy Kreme doughnuts are soooo delicious and moreish that you'll struggle to limit yourself to just the one; they're pretty expensive but worth every penny. You can watch the conveyor belt to see the fresh doughnuts being made, and, if you're really lucky, you might even get a free sample. You can also pick up your doughnuts through the drive thru window."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in town. This location is very convenient. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Drove around 30 trying to get some doughnuts found this place and my wife asked if they had sugar free doughnuts , the lady told us we had the wrong place in a hella rude attitude..."}
{"text":"Otimo lugar para visitar e fazer um lanche rapido em um passeio por Manchester."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme doughnuts are the Rolls-Royce of doughnuts...so why did I feel like I had been for a ride in a cheap Dacia?

After a bit of shopping in the Trafford Centre with my brother, we made a decision to stop by the 'Flag Ship' Trafford Krispy Kreme store for a coffee and Donut each.
After seeing how big the queue for the drive through was, we decided to go into the store and have our little treat inside.
When you get into the store, you are faced with what can only be described as Donut lovers Heaven!
Behold, for before you is a conveyor belt of Donut, after Donut, after Donut, just floating on by towards a waterfall of Sugar Glazed Utopia...
or in other words Spin class, after Spin class, after Spin class worth of goodies that would need to be burned off the next week for all of you watching your waistline! 

Bearing this in mind, we both opted for a Regular Hot Drink combo [which comprises of a reg hot drink and any 2 donuts Â£5] rather than a dozen. 
We were served within 5 minutes and made our way to the seating area....
now, i understand that it was probably a busy time on a Saturday evening, but it doesn't excuse the fact that there was rubbish on at least a third of the empty tables and half eaten donuts and paper on the floor.
It took at least 10-15 minutes before someone came out to clear the tables.
Its a shame the eat in area was like this actually, because the donuts and Latte we had where delicious! 

Over all my experience of the actual Krispy Kreme donuts where fantastic, this store just needs a member of staff just tidying up non stop. I'm not the first person I know to mention that it was untidy when they visited at an earlier date either! For that reason, I'm giving KK 4 stars just on the strength of the actual product they sell!"}
{"text":"This was my most favorite visit to a Krispy Kreme. Dawn provided exceptional customer service and was a delight to speak with. Thank you from NJ."}
{"text":"Amazing beyond description!
My Birthday party this year will just consist of Krispy Kreme doughnuts, I assure you.
You have never lived until you've had a caramel dreamcake!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning 9am, 4 employees and 1 customer in front, one behind me.  Wait 3-4 minutes to even get acknowledged, no biggie.  They had a hard time figuring out what assorted meant... not all glazed... not all non-glazed.  Everyone seemed still asleep or working at half speed.  Not what I remember KK to be.  Glazed coming off the line, but 5 minutes later when I finally tasted they sure were cold.... hmmm.  I'll stick to Bosa's... better tasting, fresher and bigger."}
{"text":"I've been to this location four times in two months and they always are out of doughnuts unless you order original. I think I may be done buying doughnuts here."}
{"text":"I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person in the world who hates Krispy Kreme doughnuts? I'm all for a bit of junk food but these are just vile. Over-rated, over-priced and over-processed. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Fraudulent store! Employees are super rude and they turn their \"hot\" sign on even when they aren't making donuts in an order to get more customers."}
{"text":"This is probably the closest Krispy Kreme to me and has always been somewhat okay to go to. Not great not absolutely horrible but this trip was a mess. I had a coupon for a $2 latte and donut and came with a one dollar coin and some more change to pay. The girl working in drive thru this morning did not know how to count or did not realize I had a one dollar coin and told me I didn't give her enough money. I counted before I left the house. I had enough money. I let her charge my card .70 which wasn't even worth it at that point, but I had to anyway. Thanks for being incompetent, I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Monstrously stupid people must run this place.  Who keeps the outside doors closest to the handicapped parking spaces locked?  Do they not understand that the handicapped have mobility issues?"}
{"text":"mmmm Doughnuts.


 Doesn't get much better than this! Its a Krispy Kreme drivethro!! You can watch the doughnuts being made, and staff regularly give out freebies when there is a queue.


 The creme filled are the best and no other doughnuts come close to this.


 It it located next to asda and across the road from The Trafford Centre."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times in the evening. Doughnuts were dry and small sized. I prefer Cravin Donuts on S Rural Rd near ASU."}
{"text":"Yummy. I try to avoid junk food but this place is one of my guilt pleasures. A dozen of your favourites for Â£9.95; personal favourites include the new millionaires shortbread, chocolate custard, apple cinnamon and strawberry gloss.

The decor is typical american diner, comfy enough to stay in and enjoy with a coffee or just use the drive through. As soon as you walk in you see the donuts being freshly made on the conveyor belt. It takes a lot of willpower to walk in and just buy one!!! The delicious smell alone makes me want 5 or more!! The staff are patient and helpful; only downside, a little slow at making the coffees."}
{"text":"Human being is never been 100% perfect all the time. I hope we may understand people that made a mistake. Sometimes those mistakes is with excusable reason."}
{"text":"Bad times were had...again. It seems this location can never manage to open on time. They open at 5:30 and I showed up around 5:35. The manager and employee showed up about a minute after I did. On a previous visit I showed up at 5:45 and was told they weren't open because their clock only said 5:15. After that I was rudely told to leave."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Krispy Kreme. These doughnuts are the best I've ever tasted especially freshly made. They are expensive so it's a rare treat for us. So many different choices, so little time! The staff are great & it's worth staying to watch the doughnuts being made as they sometimes give you a freebie! The kids love being able to watch them being made to. 
Also very clean & I like the fact I can see where the doughnuts have been made."}
{"text":"Fast wifi, coffee is barely warm, no paid/free refill. I asked to brew a new pot, they were nice to do so. Customer services depends on who you deal with... mixed result.

[UPDATE after 5 mins]
I gave 3 stars now 1, zero is possible. I sat close to the door and he spray Windex cleaning, no warning what so ever. all fallen on me, my coffee, laptop screen. What IS this place?"}
{"text":"I went in here this morning at 5:40a to get my work friends doughnuts, and what do they tell me \"We are out of doughnuts, we do not have any at all, and do not expect to for another hour and a half\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You are a doughnut place, all you do is sell doughnuts and you're telling me you have NONE? what a joke, do not recommend, i love the doughnuts but their customer service sucks."}
{"text":"Not even started writing my review and I'm already craving a glazed KK doughnut ok, ok! a box of them. Great pick-me-up for PMT, needing to make friends in the office quick or just a treat. 
Love them too much. Do not venture in on an empty stomach as previous reviewer mentioned, I totally agree, else you'll come out with 3 boxes and no change.
Nice touch that as you wait you can watch them being prepared, dipped and boxed. I recommend leaving the kids in the car if you don't want pester power as it can be a bit frantic on a busy day at the till."}
{"text":"This is the best krispy kreme! Doughnuts are always fresh and everybody is always super nice. Way better than some of the other locations I've visited"}
{"text":"History lesson: Krispy Kreme is recovering from going out of business you would naturally assume it was because they had a poor product and the business suffered the consequences. That is not true in this case. From what I am able to determine the major shareholders voted and made it so that only a major shareholder could start a franchise they then ran the franchises for 2 years and sold the franchise back to the company for the purchasing price. That is like I bought a car from you and got to drive it for 2 years and then sold it back to you for the same price I bought it for. Hmmm. Needlesss to say this is a violation of GAAP (generally accepted accounting practices) and completely unsustainable. The company collapsed and thousands lost their jobs. In fact the only people who were not hurt in the collapse were the franchise owners/major shareholders, yes the people who caused the collapse and misery made millions while everyone else was hosed. Now the franchise owners/major shareholder are at it again.
       
 To the review: This store only makes glazed donuts which are good but every other donut is made off site. Does dunkin donuts or rainbow donuts just down the street do that? I don't know. the donuts they make fresh were great just not worth the almost 2 hour drive to get them. I remember them being larger and better tasting."}
{"text":"Honestly, since i'm new to the Area, I had to try Dunkins Donuts (which I tried in Henderson) and this location of krispy kreme(my first time here) just yesterday.

It wasn't that good, or memorable. I was honestly super disappointed with my experience at both, overpriced for what you get, and the doughnuts are only okay. I've had better at AL'S Donut Shop on Azure, and you get a lot more for your money, and for a quality product. 

The most expensive donuts i've ever had. $12.99 for a dozen! I come from a city that overpriced as is ( outside of Nevada) and no one would pay this much for a dozen donuts back home, and with so many reasonably priced and so much variety in Las Vegas, i'm surprised people would here."}
{"text":"Only putting ONE star because that Asian blonde girl totally turned me off!!! But I love their donuts! I came here with my friend to get the buy one dozen, get one free promotion for the Hero Appreciation thingy. My friend ordered hers first, then it was supposed to be ME, and THEN this guy who walked in AFTER! But nooooo! The girl totally blew me off and took the guy's order instead! Like, you see me in line ALREADY and I'm right in front of the counter! Like I've been there!!!! Wtf?! So I didn't wanna order anymore & just left without getting my donuts! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place!

The staff are always helpful and very pleasant. When I first visited a week or so after it opened I thought this service won't last! But no I was wrong even now they are still cheerful and helpful. 

It's a great place to sit off and talk with friends while watching the staff make the donuts and watching the machinery that makes the donuts. Well I enjoy seeing that side of production anyway!

Donuts are great, now and again staff will give you a free original glazed while you are ordering. Right off the conveyor while it's still hot. Yummy!

Have used drive-thru once and service was fast, efficient and totally different. I mean it's not a McDonalds or KFC yet there's a drive-thru?! 

Definitely worth checking it out. Kids will love it being able to watch the donuts being made. It's not cheap though compared to your normal sayers/gregg's and supermarket donuts."}
{"text":"I walked in and walked out they have bugs all over the donuts fucken gross. I asked they have bugs the girl says yea, like really. The donuts are not in closed its open for bugs to get in..... there's no way to put a quarter star so had to put 1 star."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.
Had to visit after a trip to the Trafford Centre. Couldn't believe it when I saw a Drive thru!!
A small queue so the lady was handing out free doughnuts while we waited.
Very busy but served quickly. Bought a mixed dozen, which we can vouch for, all lovely and fresh!
Slow making the coffee but overall excellent."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme is far too pricey and far too unhealthy, like, ridiculously so on both counts. However, it produces wonderful doughnuts, so I tend to turn a blind eye to the hit I receive on both my wallet and my waistline. The store at Trafford is easy to find with parking available. All the workings of doughtnut-making are on show through a glass screen, which is entertainment enough."}
{"text":"Well this wasn't the donut trip I was expecting. Let me tell you what was wrong with my visit. Although the donuts satisfied our cravings the customer service wasn't satisfying. We weren't greeted when we walked In, the girl who took our order was kinda slow, we had to repeat ourselves more than twice so she can get our order right and at the end she gave us the wrong donuts. She also seemed very annoyed making me and my boyfriend very uncomfortable because she was staring at us the whole time like hurrying us up and even gave us a weird look. Once we were done she checked us out as fast as she could again in a very rude way with no \" have a good day\" or anything. I don't think she was happy to be there."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme doughnuts are the pinnacle of all sugary, baked goods. I have tried a large variety of doughnuts here and have the waistline to prove it! All products are fresh and made to a very high quality.


 Coffee is good to but don't have a sweet coffee as it'll be taken over by the pure sugary goodness that is the glazed ring doughnut.


 Expensive but worth it, no other doughnut is even close to tasting the same as a Krispy Kreme - try the Chocolate Dreamcake, I have sacificed much to celluliteus for this godly doughnut."}
{"text":"We bought a dozen assorted doughnuts from this location and almost $15 was charged to my card. Make sure that you check your receipt before leaving the store."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Friendly staff and Katrina, the manager, was awesome!  She was terrific with our kids on the tour and everyone had a great time!  Donuts were fresh and delicious, we will definitely be back!  :)"}
{"text":"These doughnuts are about two and a half times the price of, and half the size of, doughnuts from e.g. Greggs, and much as I wish they weren't, they are worth it!
So fresh and light and amazingly tasty - don't buy a box unless you have company with you there and then, because if you buy them thinking you'll share them later with friends, just know they will not last.
I have to stay away or I would be bankrupt and have severe diabetes.
Did I mention they were good?"}
{"text":"Wanted to find out what the fuss was with these donuts from across the pond so i walked in their outlet in Manchester City Center Piccadilly bus station. I bought a dozen i couldn't wait to get home and have them with my tea.
This is one of most overrated, over-hyped American food i have ever eaten, these donuts are so sweet you might as well have had a tablespoon of icing sugar every time you take bite. If you have kids please do everything in your power to keep them away from this rubbish!!"}
{"text":"So the BF decided to take my daughter and I for some fresh Krispy Kreme donuts after our St Patrick's Day 5k run last Saturday.  I know - totally defeating the purpose of a 5k run but what the heck.  Noone can believe I have never been there prior to now.  As I am not a donut girl, I was more in the mood for a bagel but decided to roll with it for this time as there was this special donut I was to be introduced to- says my BF.  Hmm.  I'm so intrigued.

As we walk in, there is a family ahead of us and immediately the lady behind the counter offers us a sample.  To me a sample is a BITE Krispy Kreme!  A BITE!  No I was handed this warm, soft, sweet, right out of the oven goodness.....mind you it was not a bite it was a whole glazed donut!  Wow what the heck now??  Eat it and leave?  No....do the right thing....order what you came here for. LOL  By now the 300+ calories I just lost by running just added that back and then some....and then out of pure nice obligation I ordered a cinnamon roll.  Tear. Guilt.  Pleasure.  As we devoured (I didnt eat the whole thing btw) the 2nd round of donuts I must say that I was quite impressed with this melt in your mouth breakfast (I guess thats what you call it). haha

The people working were very nice and helpful. How could you not be nice and sweet when you put smile on people's faces every day.  The place was clean other than the floors were super sticky....I guess that goes with the sticky sweet donuts or its just their ploy to keep you stuck there. 

While I am not a sweets girl and would much prefer a bagel, I would have to say it was the best dern donut I ever had!  There you go!  We wont be making this a 5k race tradition...just sayin."}
{"text":"Went there this morning. Three people working, they were moving like turtles on slow. I've seen faster funeral processions. Drive through full, lobby full and their attitude was we just don't care. I left so I can't say how good donughts were."}
{"text":"Ok I like Krispy Kremes, I've already said so in my review of the centre branch.

But I would honestly say the last thing Manchester needs is a drive-thru doughnut store. I mean come on! 

It's not hard to get out of your car and go into a shop! I can't believe anyone would go to the drive-thru! It's ridiculous!

Although I love the doughnuts, I cannot rate this store due to the fact I think it's ridiculously unnecessary."}
{"text":"There come times in everyone's life when you simply must have a doughnut.  While I normally try to eat healthy foods, sweet pastries are one of my weaknesses. I may be able to suppress the desire for months at a time, but sooner or later I cave in to the temptation.

Among my very occasional guilty pleasures, I count the original glazed, and chocolate-iced glazed doughnuts from Krispy Kreme.  Served fresh and warm, they are so soft that your fingers sink into the doughy pastry as you pull off a bite, and the sticky sugar-glaze melts in your mouth.

It's probably not possible to make a truly healthy doughnut, but Krispy Kreme has at least taken steps to make they're delicious doughnuts less unhealthy, and they've done this without compromising the taste.  Namely, Krispy Kreme has reduced the amount of trans fat in all their doughnuts to half a gram or less, which (per U.S. FDA guidelines) allows them to advertise the doughnuts as having 0 grams of trans fat.  However, bear in mind that if you have two or three doughnuts in one sitting, you're probably consuming at least a gram of trans fat, and you should know that's not healthy!  

If I rated Krispy Kreme on taste alone, I would give it five stars.  But I'm going to treat doughnut shops the same way I treat a fast-food burger joint.  Because both types of establishments have limitations on the quality of their atmosphere, service, and nutritional content, my highest rating is four stars.  So that's what my favorite doughnut shop gets."}
{"text":"Let's start this out by saying that we don't get donuts very often but I had a yen for them yesterday so we stopped here. When they handed me my $NINE DOLLAR DOZEN of donuts through the drive-thru window they were hot to the touch,  but when we got them home and tried them, they were STALE....obviously RE-HEATED DAY-OLD donuts. So beware of them passing off fresh donuts for stale ones!! (Excuse the crumpled receipt, but i really didn't think I would be needing it.)"}
{"text":"Beyond annoyed this morning when I drove 30 minutes across town after I specifically called and was told hot now hours were from 5 AM to 10 AM every day then after arriving at 5:30 AM they said no hot till 6 AM with no apology. The voice recording is incorrect and they need to change this so future customers don't experience the same inconvenience as I experienced this morning. 

When I specifically called to find out what time they serve hot and then I'm told otherwise with no apology when I arrive is a shitty way to run a business"}
{"text":"Long drive thru waits for nad service and there always out of donuts and its a freakn donut place like how do you run out of donuts if the day just started"}
{"text":"Never go to a Krispy Kreme that don't make donuts on site! This one does and that free warm donut fresh off the conveyor is always amazing!"}
{"text":"I waited at the counter for 6 minutes alone, all alone. 4...yes 4 workers looked at me, one said hi and yet no one asked if I'd been helped. No one bothered to take my order. 

Finally after saying, \"excuse me\" twice the drive thru lady came to help. It took about 4 more minutes to get to the paying point because she was sooooo overwhelmed by myself and one drive thru car that she couldn't even focus. I ordered one donut. It's not that hard. 

The two stars are because I love those damn glazed chocolate things."}
{"text":"The donuts taste like, well, donuts. I prefer mine cold and they tend to only serve theirs hit, though. What really irritated me was the fact that their iced coffee is a joke! It was so watered down and tasted like they just poured their hot coffee over ice before they served it to me. My husband got the red velvet iced drink, and he said it was great. So I guess if you want a fancy, sugary drink with your just ok donuts this is your place! I definitely still prefer Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"Rubbish, heart attack inducing rubbish. Man handled by some bloke and then sold a donut I didn't want nor ask for, this will be the only time I visit this trashy hole."}
{"text":"I called to place a large order feeding around 400-500 people. Typically, it is $11 per glazed dozen. I needed 35 dozen donuts and she quoted me at $580. Instantly, i thought her math was incorrect. That would make it over $16 a dozen. I asked her why it was so much and she gave me attitude and said that for bulk orders they charge more... that makes zero sense. I will definitely be going elsewhere, considering i can save $200."}
{"text":"I absolutely love getting the blueberry cakes.  The ones today I got were so good, soft, and moist and I just couldn't get enough.  Service in the drive-thru is always friendly and prompt and they never leave me waiting to take my order.  The only thing I would like to see better is when giving me my receipt say thank you or something.  I'm not complaining but think their customer service needs a little touch up."}
{"text":"Right on the money! Service was fast and friendly, and the donuts were fresh and tasty. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"If you deserve a guilty pleasure this is the place to be! 
Delicious, Scrumptious and Delectable Doughnuts..enough said!"}
{"text":"The only thing I ever get is the hot glazed donuts, so I can't speak to the quality of their other donuts.  Nor can I speak to the interior bc I only use the drive thru.  They always have hot donuts (the sign is always on), so you may have to wait a few minutes at times, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Krispy Kreme experience ever! We came here around 9:45 to get two boxes to take home on the evening of Black Friday. The lady that helped us was incredibly rude. No matter the circumstance, and I don't even know if she worked an all day/night shift, she should have been friendly. That aside, I notice some man mopping the floors, water going *wooosh* inside where the donuts are just laying there on the machine. I could not believe my eyes!! The labels did not match the donuts on display and when we asked her to clarify, she gave us a long speech about how they distribute donuts to the gas stations and blah blah blah. I was honestly ready to walk out but we were lucky enough to just pick out the donuts on display that were at least covered by a glass door. I will not come back here... ever"}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't try to order them from grub hub they we ordered chocolate lover and assorted, they called and said out of assorted ok we make a new order of chocolate lovers and glazed sorry we are out of chocolate lovers not sure why grub hub uses them I am pretty sure they just cancel your order wether they have it or not"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Krisy Kreme's. Won a year's supply of donuts from here last year and am really gutted that it has ended. Love the donuts, especially the limited edition ones that they bring out for different occasions, eg. halloween, valentines and xmas. Definitely worth going to the one at the trafford centre, if only for a free taster donut on arrival!"}
{"text":"FAST,FRIENDLY & GREAT customer service. We went through the drive-thru & Andrea was so sweet the whole time, held a smile & was so courteous. They were so quick to get our freshly made dozen glazed donuts out. Had an awesome experience here, place was clean inside & out!"}
{"text":"Original glazed!!! Need I say more?? I usually go to KK during its peak hour. Because these donuts are so much better when they are fresh off the conveyor belt. Its like perfect combination of dough, sugar, and warm oil. 

Sometimes I imagine myself going through the tiny cascade of donut glazer, lying supine on that conveyor belt and get covered. Except the frying part. Of course. Only donuts should be fried. 

I've noticed about bad service in previous reviews. I am like who cares, give me a free sample and take my money already!!"}
{"text":"I walk in around 9am no one is in the counter so I tried to do some sound to get somebody's attention one girl look but didn't do anything so I waited around 5 minutes then the lady working on drive thru show up and ask for sorry and say I'll be right there and I think the other girl went to bathroom after certain of time the other girl came back so I give my order 4 dozen so total 4 boxes and I paid then after that she's giving me the 4 boxes so I look at her and ask me do you want plastic bag and I said off course it's much easier to carry right that's what I told her definitely not going back to that branch"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years, mainly because my kids love to watch the fresh doughnuts being made. If you are lucky, you might get one right off the belt, their original glazed.. OMG that's like DEATH BY DOUGHNUTS!! 

They have a great selection, some of our favs are chocolate glazed, sugar and of course the original glazed which is our all time favorite. Now they have a Vegas Golden Knights - VGK doughnut!!

If you take your kids report card to them, they give you a free glazed doughnut for every A, maximum you can get is half a dozen. How cool is that!!"}
{"text":"I am not a sweet tooth kinda gal, but I simply cannot resist Krispy Kreme original glazed and Cronuts! I love the staff here. They are so pleasant and always eager to give customers their free glazed donut! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love Krispy Kreme and eat far too many of these. I have a horrible habit of buying a dozen as its such good value and it means I can have all the flavours I want! I can recommend the classic glazed raspberry but I also love apple pie.

This Krispy Kreme always seems quiet so you get served quickly and the staff are friendly and helpful (although my requests to limit my consumption are always ignored!). If anyone wants to set up a Krispy Kreme support group I'm up for it, I'll bring the donuts......"}
{"text":"After my visit today and not buying donuts  Dunkin' Donuts and bosa Will be the places I go to for service Krispy Kreme has shitty drive-through service and even in the lobby bad experience all around"}
{"text":"How is it your Krispy Kreme with no doughnuts! How is that bringing in business! The machine was broke! And the left overs were days old! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I love eating doughnuts .  I like Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, because I alway stop by to buy their doughnuts very time I near by one.  Today I drove by Krispy Kreme on main and Dobson road, the services was great.  The girl who helping me is excellence.  I asked her to do the original glazed with just half of the glazed and she so helpful with  my request and it come out so great.  If you want good doughnuts and great service, come here and you will like it."}
{"text":"Original glazed fresh out of the oven is my fav!

This location has friendly staff and area is relatively clean. I've been here 2-3 times and all those times they were making the fresh doughnuts... so either I'm lucky or they make a new batch every hour or so. 

Sometimes there are coupons that give buy one dozen get the second dozen free."}
{"text":"Bought 1/2 doz donuts today at 1:30pm. We were excited for the treat since we hadn't had their donuts in many years.  We ate two donnuts, a glazed and raspberry filled.  Both of them were raw, the glazed was greasy on top of it.  The glazed was warm and had been taken right off the glazing rack.  Not sure we will be able to eat the remaining. Six bucks down the drain.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever. Hands down especially when you get them fresh right when they come out and ready and glazed. I love Krispy Kreme donuts more than any other place!"}
{"text":"We went on a Krispy Kreme doughnut splurge. Just one of those notions. So 24 bought in 24 hours. That's it for at least six months. They are filling, the jam and apple ones are well stuffed with fruit and not overly sweet. The cream type fillings are generous too. I'm not a fan of the chocolate they use as it's rubbish. They ain't cheap either, at Â£12 for 12 if you choose your own selection. You'll save Â£1 for 12 if the store imposes 12, which are mostly unfilled ring type doughnuts. I prefer Dunkin Donuts but they aren't back in the UK........yet. As for its origins: Vernon Rudolph didn't set out to be an American doughnut king. It all started for him when his uncle bought a general grocery shop and paid a Frenchman, Joe leBeau, who was a river barge cook on the Ohio river, for his yeast based doughnut recipe. Joe had a reputation for light, fluffy doughnuts. Vernon then opened his own shop in 1937 and using his uncles purchased recipe began selling his own Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts, first to other stores then to customers who called for hot doughnuts during production midnight to four am. Thereafter he began franchising. Fast forward 78 years and we have a company with a near half billion dollar annual turnover and a wheat product suitable for vegetarians, is certified halal and claims to be kosher, but not yet so certified. For all this progress the doughnuts still have artificial flavours, still aren't made with free range eggs, they have trace trans fat but advertise as trans fat free as U.S. regulations allow companies to round to zero any product with 0,5 grams or less trans fat per serving. They are fried in a mix of palm and sunflower oils - but the oils aren't all from sustainable sources and this matters when you produce millions of doughnuts each year. Still an occasional guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Yeah this is just a chain donut shop but still, getting another dozen free for buying a dozen make us feel good. That is #DayOfTheDozens - December 12 (12-12) every year.

The two dozens went to my wife's coworkers, but we scored another two pieces for ourselves - for free!

It's a bummer that their donuts contain trans-fat - something I have to keep out from my diet. That is why having Krispy Kreme is a rare occasion, but when I do, I enjoy it a lot."}
{"text":"Not complaining.  Came here for my birthday freebies.  Fast in and out, polite employees too!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite donut place. It has changed. I suggested to a few friends today to stop here for a little afternoon snacks. I felt a little embarrassed after wards.

The price went up. The place is a little rundown. The service was just bearable. The worst thing was the donuts somehow does not taste as good as before.

I don't think I would come back here again unless I am desperate."}
{"text":"Yes, I sniffed out a KK in Vegas!

There must be crack sprinkled in their donuts because they're so addicting! Luckily, the nearest one is about 20-30 mins away from where I live, so I don't/can't go there as often as my cravings would like to. It's kremey krack!  

One of my favs is the oreo creme one (NOT the cake one). The oreo cake one is just like a donut made out of cake. I ordered that one on accident.  
Oops! 

It's unfortunate (fortunate for my gut) that there's no more kk's in the valley like there used to be or else I'd be a big fat fattie!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in after my son's indoor soccer games on Saturday and Sunday morning. I've never seen this place crowded and they always have an excellent selection of donuts. If you're craving donuts, Krispy Kreme is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Had the cookies and cream filled doughnut and it was very delicious! On the other hand, I purchased a vanilla iced coffee and it did not taste anything like vanilla. Besides the coffee, I definitely will recommend the doughnuts here."}
{"text":"Came in for free coffee day. Who says no to free coffee? Well anyway, I only drink it iced so I had to pay $1. No biggie, I got two. The kids wanted some donuts so I picked up a few. It's been years since I have had an original glazed. It was alright. This location doesn't have the full frying/glazing contraption that I have seen at other locations. They must come in frozen.

If you need to use the restroom, be sure to ask for the key from the front. Understandable given the location."}
{"text":"Great donuts as usual, awful customer service at this location. They were short and rude in the drive thru, never told me my total, wouldn't accept the coupon, and we're just generally very rude.. While doing a mix and match dozen I said how many do I have left over?? (Trying to order 12) and she said \"what, you weren't counting.. 2 left\" in a rather annoyed voice. Not cool. 

But glazed and apple fritter. Delicious."}
{"text":"A 5 star rating for a chain donut place? Yep!

When the hot & ready sign is on I believe it's a sign from up above to slow down and pull into their parking lot! You can smell the sugar in the air the moment you get out of your car...

You walk in and you see the glistening, hot donuts smiling at you as they come down the conveyer belt and watching them get coated with glaze is slightly erotic. Maybe it's just me? I don't know but I don't care because I can watch this procedure until they ask me to leave :)

There's really nothing like a warm original donut and it's so light it begins to melt to the  touch of your fingertips. Dear Krispy Kreme people, please never ever stop making hot donuts, sincerely one of your biggest fans.
I would also like to thank you for your free samples. It's such a nice gesture and this is why I love you!"}
{"text":"Usually the donuts are really good but today I got fresh donuts and the bottom of them was extra crispy .. Guess I'll change locations next time"}
{"text":"Pulled up to get the dozen doughnuts for $.80 and sign on the door said out of doughnuts... This happens every special event. When are you guys going to be better prepared. This is one of the main reasons I stopped coming here there are too many other doughnut places to choose from"}
{"text":"Krispy creme doughnuts what can you say near the Trafford Centre. This outlet is a drive-through and they make the doughnuts there for many of the supermarkets and a shop that is in the city centre. For a doughnut it is quite expensive but it is quality and very nice.  lots to choose from and you can get drinks hot and cold."}
{"text":"I like Krispy Kreme a lot, but I do not like this location.  The donuts here don't taste as good as any other I have had at the franchise, and I have had Krispy Kreme in NY, PA, Puerto Rico and other AZ locations.  Also the staff here, at least when I have gone, haven't been the smartest individuals. I came here once with my family through the drive thru, only to find a sign that read \"Out of Order Come Inside\". Not the most polite note.  When we came in although the red sign was on in the window (the one indicating that fresh donuts are being made) when we walked in we noticed that many of the lights were off. We figured perhaps it was a energy saving initiative.  We waited online for about 10 minutes before an employee comes and tells us that the electricty is out and that all that was available was what was in the glass. We were bothered that the young man who was at the register and saw us come in and saw us waiting for 10 minutes didn't inform us as soon as we walked in but let us wait on line and that another employee came and told us. It was a waste of our time since we came specifically for fresh glazed donuts, which we understandably believed to be available because they left the red signage on in the window. I guess they had a back up generator for the outside signage."}
{"text":"Tried to get a dozen glazed donuts for a coworkers birthday and got to the drive thrust 5:45 am and was informed they had no donuts ready as they are making a bunch for another event and wouldn't have anything else going for 40 minutes. Didn't get my donuts.  Maybe you should plan ahead and accordingly for big event orders so regular customers can get donuts too."}
{"text":"This is the first K. Kreme I've ever been too... I like it:) fresh donuts, delicious coffee, and polite service.  Can't complain... Worth the drive from Central Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to get the new Reese's Peanut Butter donut.  Read the reviews and saw the YouTube videos.  But the reality was sooo disappointing.  Less than a teaspoon of filling, very little chocolate frosting and no lines of chocolate and peanut frosting across the top.  So I called the manager today because if I was unhappy others would be too.  She was defensive.  Never apologized.  Blamed it on the \"processor\" person. Offered to give me two donuts free. Which is nice, but I was hoping she would want to correct the making of this donut.  
My suggestion is just go to the market and buy a filled donut and put peanut butter chips on top.  
This was a waste of money.  So sad."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot every morning for coffee and doughnuts. I signed up for the Krispy Kreme app recently and have been racking up points quickly. I get a free dozen any doughnuts after like every 10 visits. If you do have the app the scanner at the drive thru doesn't work and neither does the other scanners at times. So make sure you them double check to see if it worked before they charge you. I love the holiday and seaonal doughnuts they get. Right now they have one called Santa's belly that looks pretty cool and some other christmas one. My go to doughnut is the cake batter, hands down the best. All the workers are nice and friendly but Carmen is the most awesome out of them all. She always gives great customer service and deserves a raise. Bye bye dunkin donuts! Hello Krispy kreme!"}
{"text":"Out of all cake donuts by 10am on a recent Saturday AM. Hot and fresh glazed donuts tasted cold and oily 3 minutes later. Almost 12 bucks for a dozen of those donuts was ripoff. Only the free dozen coupon saved face, but then again this is a tiny store and the employees either cannot make donuts fast enough or don't care to keep up with demand."}
{"text":"The Original Glazed is decent if you can get one just as it comes off the conveyor belt.

We usually don't bother with the other kinds of donuts here, as it's a crapshoot as to how long they have been sitting on the shelf.

I'm not a coffee drinker, so I can't say if they have decent coffee drinks here (they have a number of flavored coffee drinks). I usually just grab a bottle of milk from their cooler.

Maybe we've just been lucky, but the cashier here was pleasant and friendly every time we visited this location.

The drive-thru is open 24 hours a day, so it can be fun to stop here when we're on our way home late at night, but again, you gotta time it just right to hit them up when the Original Glazed donuts are coming fresh off the line or you're probably gonna get stale donuts."}
{"text":"My friend mosh used Google to find this place and he told me it closes at 5:00am. I came here and it wasn't so terrible service thx enjoy my review -best regards"}
{"text":"This was the worst dozen I have bought . I do not recommend  this location. They we're not done all the way. The other half of dozen was cold.   So much for hot and ready."}
{"text":"I went to drive thru just now. I paid $3.25 10ct donuthole cake on a cup. She gave me not fresh, taste not good, cold donut not warm or hot. 
I was expecting a fresh hot or maybe warm good krispy kreme. 
I should just go a regular donut shop.

4:40am - i came back at the drive thru. The drive thru lady is not friendly. I asked to exchange for regular size glaze & she gave me 2 pieces only for the same price of $3.25. 

I will not come back to this store & i will not recommend this store."}
{"text":"The problem isn't the product. It's the service. There is always a long line with no one around trying to help or coordinate people. It's left to one person to get doughnuts and check out customers, while never apologizing for the long wait. 

Don't ever expect just to quickly run in and get a donut and leave. It's so disappointing to have such poor customer service."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme Doughnuts are the best, and I am telling you right now, you need to go when the red fresh light is on, because when you get a glazed that just rolled off the belt I Kidd you not, it will literally melt in your mouth! Krispy Kreme Kleans the Kompetition!"}
{"text":"Went here today and they told me they had no original glazed donuts, no chocolate donuts, and no cake donuts. So...um....why are you even open?"}
{"text":"I usually stop here on the way to work Saturday mornings. The lady at the drive thru is always super sweet. I get a dozen assorted donuts and I let them do the picking because I am in a hurry. I have never been disappointed with their selections. My favorite is the original glazed, but it has to be fresh out of the dryer , and the chocolate iced kreme filled. A dozen donuts runs just under $10. They also have hot coffee and iced/blended coffee drinks as well."}
{"text":"As always, great friendly service. Delicious donuts. Just an all around good place to eat."}
{"text":"Wouldn't let me keep my souvenir golden knights ticket when I went to get a free dozen donuts, really? Over $6 worth of donuts. That's a shame"}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible. I waited at the drive thru window for 7 minutes. No one said to hold on, or even acknowledged me. The donuts are always okay, sometimes burnt, and the coffee isn't so great, so 3 stars are for the service and quality of the donuts combined."}
{"text":"i love how people are trying to get free stuff and when they dont they put that it is a bad place. it is krispy kreme they serve there doughnuts hot and fresh if you want old doughnuts go to the supermarket. I went in i got my doughnut off of the belt and it melted in my mouth and was what i expected"}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme doughnuts! The best doughnuts ever! The customer service was great!! I was having a difficult time figuring out which doughnuts to get for everyone and had to make multiple stops.. The customer service suggested that I just get 3 1/2 dozen and what a great idea! Everyone will be enjoying doughnuts as I stop by and make my deliveries:) too bad Krispy Kreme doughnuts doesn't deliver to homes! Ha!"}
{"text":"Came here one weekend expecting to get a few dozen donuts for my friends and family but the facility was closed due to a water pipe being broken.

No water, meant not business.

I had to go elsewhere.

Just wish, they had notified the public of the closing.  I wouldn't have wasted my drive.

At least I was able to use the NFCU ATM that was next door."}
{"text":"I went into the store at 7:30 a.m. one work day.  I was highly impressed with the cleaniness of the interior. Two ladies were behind the counter adorned with smiles and eager to toss some hot donuts into boxes. 

Too, Krispy Kreme is running a sweet deal...basically 2 dozen donuts for the price of 1!"}
{"text":"When I was attending ASU I would pass this location several days a week.  Sometimes I would get lucky and the Red Light would be on.  Which means it's time for a treat!  I've read the other reviews for this location and I was surprised.  I've always received fresh, tasty donuts and good service."}
{"text":"Really? Sold out of half your donuts at 930 on a Sunday? Also, customer service was severely lacking."}
{"text":"We had to get the dozen of course with all the best flavors. Raspberry filled and this oreo kreme filled are probably my top two there forsure. Nice workers and little spot to grab some soft doughnuts."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Krispy Kreme Doughnuts? This place has the doughnut maker so I was able to request for a doughnut right off the press! OMG... it was so soft and chewy! I loved every bite! The workers were friendly too! Too bad I live so far away!"}
{"text":"Dawn was the coolest lady! Super helpful and quick! Interior is really nice inside, and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fast service , accurate polite and nice. Doughnuts were amazing as always. Needed last minute breakfast for a work meeting and they were very accomadating."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings on this Krispy cream. 

I would have given it four stars but I just went back a day later and received horrible service. A two star at that.

The first visit was wonderful. The young gentlemen explained all the favors, pricing and let us even sample a couple options. It was my first visit to a Krispy Kreme (I know, crazy!) and he was really awesome and even gave my friend, daughter and I Krispy Kreme hats. That was really the cherry on top. When I got home I saw he gave me a free donut. Score!

The donuts were delicious and sugar inducing coma status for sure.

The next days go back and it took 10 minutes for any employees to even help us. I guess drive thru comes first. By the time they helped me there was a line with three others behind me. 

Next the lady was rude and u had to keep explaining which ones I wanted. She kept picking wrong ones even though I said the name correctly. 

Lastly when I went to check out she said it came to six bucks. I gave er my debit card and she charged my 60 bucks! She didn't even tell me she made a mistake and instead just stood their dumb founded and then went to the manager. They took forever to reverse it and then said the money would be back in my account in 7 to 10 days. Um wtf. I just don't get how someone makes that type of mistake. Tey never even said sorry or anything. 

This experience makes me uneasy about coming back here"}
{"text":"1st and last time here.  Went into the inner city to see a friend.  Stopped by the drive thru.  Seriously no one was inside ordering.  But it took them over 5 minutes to hand me 1 dozen glazed donuts! Cashier was not friendly,  was more like a robot.  No expression,  kid get a job you like."}
{"text":"Donuts Were Good, but customer service wasn't. I wasn't greeted when I walked up to the counter and the guy just stared at me like \"Go ahead and order.\" Then He Rushed Me through the whole order."}
{"text":"Well I'm just a fan of Krispy Kreme though I don't remember the last time I've had some prior to this visit.  Back in the day, this is a true story, after our stay in Vegas we would order boxes of Krisy Kreme and carry-on them on the plane back to Hawaii.  I'm sure we weren't the only ones who did this especially if there wasn't a Krispy Kreme there. So what's the funniest thing you've carried on to the plane when vacationing?

I use to like watching them make the doughnuts and seeing how cool it was going through the whole process from dough to my mouth.  Today I picked up a dozen of the fresh warm original glazed doughnuts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/krispy-kreme-doughnuts-las-vegas-9?select=qxUOgM4Ou5jQfX7cFMJR0Q#nqByqzZcVfHQXmiOqn5dRQ You can never go wrong with the good stuff.  The girl there even hooked me up with one extra doughnut to eat right there.  I inhaled it before I even got rang up.  What's better than having coffee and doughnuts on a nice morning in Vegas. 

Don't forget to pick up and use your buy any 10 dozen doughnuts get one dozen original glazed free.  She gave me 2 hole punches instead of 1 AWESOME."}
{"text":"It was really cool to see the process of the baking of the doughnuts! They were fresh and good! I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have always been crazy about this location. It's a sweet deal...you get to buy these sweet lil bites of joy. And what u spend won't break your bank. And if u take them home they last like 3 to 4 days. I enjoy mine with ice cold milk. This place is always clean. The people who work here always have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Strange...stopped by this morning and was greeted with a sign on front door..\"Broken Water Pipe. Closed  Until Further Notice\"??"}
{"text":"While I was feeling a little homesick one day,  you could only imagine my delight when I happened to come across an honest to goodness Krispy Kreme store!!!  Needless to say, I rushed right in and immediately ordered a dozen little rounds of heaven.  As I sat there and dived into my krack kakes (that's what some of us like to call them back in the States) I was able for at least a little while, imagine that I was back home.  

My only complaint is that they don't offer the kreme filled dougnuts, whether they be chocolate iced or glazed, all the time.  :-( Those are ALWAYS on the menu in the States and my absolut fave.  

Also don't forget, you can always take a dozen glazed back home and pop those bad boys in the microwave for 8 seconds and VOILA! You have the melt in your mouth goodness of doughnuts fresh out of the fryer, right in the comfort of you own home."}
{"text":"3 stars because they didn't have fresh doughnuts cooking. I love them right as they come out. If they had them I would have gave them 4 stars. I asked and the guy said not until 5pm. It was only 3 when I was there. Not waiting 2 hours."}
{"text":"The problem is that here, unlike most other locations, they don't actually make their donuts fresh. They just reheat and glaze them. You can really tell the difference."}
{"text":"Used to love KK donuts but they've slipped BIG TIME! Couple employees at this store are borderline rude for starters. Punch in pass code to use restroom. Donuts are now small & overpriced ($14 a dozen, I'll pass next time) The apple jelly filled had only a smidgen of filling in them off in the corner too! Donut wise there's a lot of competition in this town & very fairly priced too! Was not impressed"}
{"text":"Delicious & classic donuts. The specialty coffee is excellent too. They lack options for a half a dozen and it's kind of pricey if you just want a couple donuts."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, kinda off the main road from Rainbow. 
I cant speak how the morning rush is here since I only come as a late night snack after work after the hours from 6-8pm.
What I can say, is at this time, the place is very clean, not busy at all. Im usually 1 of 2 people here. They ALWAYS provide fresh off the line glazed donuts!! SOOOOO DELICIOUS

My favorite person here is Dawn, She always has a smile on her face and was so helpful and jolly.

HINT: Download the Krispy Kreme app and every year on your bday they send you a FREE donut (any donut) and small coffee or soda!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see this new Krispy Kreme.  I took my kids the same day I noticed it.  It looks like the Hot & Ready sign is always on.  When you walk in there won't necessarily be donuts on the belt, however if you ask them to they will put the donuts on there for you and in about 2 minutes you will have hot, melt in your mouth deliciousness.  One of my daughters wanted to try the cookies N cream doughnut.  She didn't like it but did like their original one that was hot.  Also, we bought 2 milks for $1.69 each and found out that you get a free original doughnut with a milk purchase.  Score!"}
{"text":"A month long birthday extravaganza always means extreme indulging. My boyfriend and I were hurting from the night before, so a Krispy Kreme doughnut was just the exact thing we needed. 

What better way to grab doughnuts when you're hungover than through a drive thru! So genius. 

Of course we ordered an original glazed, it's the best one there! Plus we were feeling a little wild so we also tried the chocolate with custard filling and the chocolate glazed. 

The doughnuts were still warm in the box! We ate them immediately (you kind of have to). The chocolate ones were just not my thing, also the custard was tasty, but still not my thing. The original wins them all! It's seriously the best thing ever. Next time i'm going to order 4 to myself, it's way too good to share. 

We also ordered a large iced vanilla latte (which looked like a medium). It was alright, the coffee flavor isn't strong and prominent like I would prefer. Also, the vanilla flavor was nonexistent. It was very light, milky and great for those who don't like a strong coffee flavor."}
{"text":"The donuts are sweet the service is bitter. I enjoyed the donuts and coffee I got a glazed and lemon. Both were devine. The coffee was very acidic and needs cream. The cream isn't fresh, just the little cream cups. Bosa's coffee is way better. The person who served us was rude and seemed sick. If your employee is sick send them home. We wanted to upgrade the Krispy Combo and none of the employees knew how to do it even though it says on the menu to ask how to upgrade the combo. At checkout they had no clue how to ring it up. We paid full price for the upgraded donuts when they told us it would be 10-20 cents for each upgraded donut. Over all Krispy Kreme needs to take better care of their employees so we don't have to be served by grumpy sick people and give them better training so they know their menu."}
{"text":"really tasty doughnuts cut like they do at the seaside where they fry them so they are served warm with a slighty crispy outer bit. they do some really nice flavours which you can get in a mixed box so you can try all the different varieties, but the sugar ring ones are nice aswell. they also do coffee and drinks aswell but as this is a new shop when i went the staff werent very well trained on the coffee machine and for the price of it i could have done better myself. the doughnuts are pricey but very nice, id go somewhere else to get your coffee to go with it."}
{"text":"The worst Krispy Kreme we've been to. The doughnuts were small and uneven. The coffee was subpar. Disappointed because Krispy Kreme is usually amazing."}
{"text":"Their service is really good here. The cashier was talkative and nice! Fresh donuts too. I always get the chocolate glazed ones, raspberry jelly filled, and the blueberry ones. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Well AFTER going last night, I read some reviews and OMG- someone posted 8 days ago- there was bugs on the donuts?!?!!!! Wtf omg ew!!!! 

Anyways besides that, we went around 10pm (drive thru) , so an hour before closing, the donuts werent hot , the sign wasn't on, but they were ok. Nothing too exciting and for almost closing time we didn't get any free donuts which they probably would be throwing out at the end of the night? I guess I e just always had lucky with one free donut a visit at a Krispy Kreme. 

Probably won't come back because it's far from our house AND I read the big review omg!!!!"}
{"text":"The donuts are fine.  Every once in a while the donuts are a little deformed but they still taste the same.    The staff that works at this Krispy Kreme seem miserable EVERY TIME we've stopped by.    They're not rude but they do look like they don't want to be there.  The place looks clean but as soon as you walk into it, it always hits you with a strong bad odor.  Never had an issue with the drive thru orders."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. The service sucks and they never have the doughnuts I want. The coffee is ok but small. I would never return to this location based on customer service alone. I even wrote to corp and they responded that it was in review and never any follow-up! It shows why the employees are that way if corp is!"}
{"text":"I've been on a donut kick lately, so I've been seeking out many of Las Vegas's donut shops.  I have found that Krispy Kreme offers the freshest and tastiest donuts that just melt in your mouth! Get them while their hot! They have got donut  making down to a science! You can't go wrong with any donut you choose. Here's a tip, don't go through the drive thru, a staff member may give you a free donut from time to time. :)"}
{"text":"WHAT?!!  Sour cream glazed is back?  ZOMG.   And Pumpkin SPICE?  And they were fresh as they should be.

So I lived in Winston-Salem where Krispy Kreme HQ is and I can tell you that there are a few things that are amiss here.  First, there should have been napkins given at the drive-thru window.   Who the hell eats donuts with no napkins.  Second, the price in Vegas is like $2 more for a dozen than in Winston-Salem.  So I question whether or not that's an excise fee because the ingredients have to travel further?   I would imagine that the prices should be the same everywhere, but I guess not.  In any case, that did throw me off a little.

Overall, Southerners know that Krispy Kreme is king when it comes to donut chains.  Unless you happen to be a Yankee and then you'll love that Dunkin/Winchell's.

This establishment is okay but then again I don't really go into places if I can drive through them.  Wait.... that didn't sound right."}
{"text":"This location is a bit rundown and generally it's not an ideal location in the Phoenix area, but of the two times I've been, I've had generally good experiences. I keep on as a repeat customer because of the availability of specialty doughnuts (the cake batter, Reece's and pumpkin spice!)
The staff is a little lax and slow, yet friendly...which is a saving grace for me. On my last visit another customer experienced a lot of frustration as the girl attending to her was finishing up behind-counter mopping and showed no signs of washing her hands when turning to handle orders, and the customer had to repeat her request for the attendant to wash her hands twice after back talking the customer--luckily, this wasn't my experience in the moment, but something that I'll lookout for in the future.
Overall, I've been to locations that're more friendly, attendant and clean, but the doughnuts are of fine quality and are what keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"When your kids make the grade...krispy kreme rewards students with a free original donut per A grade. Step son got 5 A's and a B. So he got 5 donuts but scored 2 donuts from this older looking man who couldn't chow the last 2 down and it was straight from the belt, still warm and melts in your mouth.

I too decided to get some donuts since I was there. Only thing, it seems like they were limited on varieties. Why I rated 4 stars. 

Still, their donuts are awesome! Happy eats!"}
{"text":"On July 11 Krispy Kreme ran a special, buy one dozen donuts and get a dozen glazed donuts for 77Â¢. We arrived at 2:30PM and waited only a minute or so to be helped. I ordered a dozen chocolate covered and a dozed glazed. The nice girl helping me told me they were out of glazed but she would give me a second dozen chocolate donuts for the special price. I accepted the offer.

Before she could box up the two dozen donuts, several other customers had entered and placed orders. 

The short version of this story is they RAN OUT OF DONUTS! I don't mean they ran out of chocolate donuts, they had NO MORE DONUTS AT ALL! I looked in the back (you know how you can see the donuts being made?) and sure enough there weren't any donuts cooking. That's some pretty poor planning.

I asked when they expected more donuts to be ready. I was told after 4:00PM, over an hour later.

So, my one star rating is because I never even got to try the donuts! 

To be honest, I'm sure I'll go back to this location at some point, but I won't go out of my way. It just isn't worth it when I run the chance that they won't have any donuts."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme is my all time favorite. Their donuts are so moist and creamy. They literally just melt in your mouth. I've always been satisfied when eating a Krispy Kreme donut."}
{"text":"This is 3rd time I've come to this Krispy Kreme and left disappointed, slow and rude customer service, and why if it's free donut day you say I can have ANY free donut but then charge me for the donut of your choosing which is least costly and says that it has to be that one. Just bad then forgets to put the correct donut in my box, never patronizing again"}
{"text":"We had a very good experience here. We were on our way come from a foster parent training class. Since our three foster kids were very good during the two class, we decided to give them a special treat. Tell you the truth, only reason why we came here. Because it was still opened.
So all five us came in and ordered a dozen. My favorite has always been the chocolate glazed whipped cream filled. Kids had there favorites, then we all tried some of the fancies. 
It was a good time, service was good, place was cleaned, price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like classic glazed donuts fresh and hot!

Krispy Kreme is a great donut place and a nice change from any other.  Although there are a few local donut shoppes that are really good and slightly better, you can't go wrong with the classic donut from this place.  As for the people who gave one star based on the donuts being cold, most donut shops serve their donuts \"cold\", so I'm not sure what the problem is.  This place is different because they make original glazed donuts nice and hot every hour, and when you see their sign turn on, get in line.

It's great for late at night or a quick dessert, in my opinion.  I'm not saying that I'm a fan by giving 4 stars, but they are better than A-OK.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"While waiting for my credit union to open up next door, I thought I would kill some time with a Krispy Kreme chocolate iced donut and a regular coffee. This store has been open for about a year in an old Taco Bell location on Dobson and Main in the Safeway shopping center. 
Parking is easy and close to the door. The store is very, very clean and the employees are OK. They have free hats on all of the tables.

It has been a while since I have had a Krispy Kreme. It was odd that this store, my coffee, and donut all seemed identical to Dunkin Donuts. KK used to seem fresher and better that DD in the past but now seems interchangeable. Have they changed, or have I? I don't know for sure, but I think I will stick with Bosa donuts in the future. Bosa has a larger selection and the donuts just seem bigger and fresher."}
{"text":"I came here the other day and the service was horrible and I swore up and down I wasn't coming back, but then today I got my cravings and didn't wanna drive across town so I gave it another try. Was reluctant to hit drive thru cause that's where the service sucked last time. We were greeted, which was a first for us! The lady this time was very patient and repeated my order back to me at the order box and at the window. It was such a huge relief knowing that only one of their employees sucked. Huge shoutout to Diana for making my experience so much better! Will definitely be coming back during her shifts!"}
{"text":"My first Krispy Kreme experience and it is good. Cake Batter donut is tasty with lemon freezer. Pumpkin spice and apple fritter is delicious as well. I spent about $10 and service was friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from Alaska and never had Krispy Kreme before. My boyfriend and I moved to the area and figured we'd try this.

1) drive thru closed. 
2) 8:40 and they were closing the inside (mopping floors - with water everywhere as kitchens do at the end of the night, usually when it's closed??). I felt like we couldn't have been shoved out the door quicker. if it was 9:30 or so I'd be understanding but the place doesn't close til 10, cmon.
3) out of pretty much everything. I went in wanting a classic glazed donut. nothin. I settled for pumpkin spice which was eh and a chocolate glazed, also eh. The donuts were small.

I was expecting so much more! I was thinking fresh like they do at Fractured Prune. Even QT has good donuts. Step up your game!! ALL YOU DO IS DONUTS!!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and ordered a dozen FILLED assorted.  I emphasized the word FILLED. The girl on the speaker asked \"You want me to pick 'em?\" I said \"yes, please, just filled\" knowing it shouldn't be too difficult with only about 5 or 6 to choose from. I should've known better. As I got halfway home, I tore open the box and there were 2 of each of the most undesirable stale, unfilled donuts...2 cinnamon sugar, 2 pink frosted, 2 pink sprinkles, 2 maple, 2 chocolate frosted, 2 orig. They were all cold & old regardless of the hot & fresh sign.  I very seldom splurge on donuts and this was a terrible let down...especially on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"The store was easy to find. It has its own parking lot and is stroller friendly. Inside the store, is a big window where my son really enjoyed wearing his complimentary paper hat and watching the donuts be made.

The staff was friendly and patiently waited while my little picked out his favorite donuts. They also waved at him while  he watched them work.

There was a large selection of donuts to choose from and the prices are reasonable. The kids love them and the quality is consistently yummy! We will return."}
{"text":"I experienced my 1st Krispy Kreme here before it ever made it to the SF Bay Area.  That trip, I ended up bringing some back on the plane, and everyone was jealous.  It's always good....even though it's a major sugar rush.  The glazed raised doughnuts cannot be matched.  What can be better?  A side of free WIFI, that's what!"}
{"text":"First off our first time to this location. We're from California and visit to see my parents all the time. Stoped by last night At about 11pm. We ordered our half a dozen donuts. Pulled up to the window to pay and we didn't get a greeting or anything from the man. He opened the window and straight asked if we saw the movie \"IT\" that there was a clown in the parking lot watching us. THe employee was in his 20's and a red head."}
{"text":"National Doughnut Day is on the first Friday of June each year. So of course this year, on Friday, June 2, we had to go to Krispy Kreme! When FREE doughnuts are involved, who can resist?! 

I've been to this location a few times before and have never seen the drive-thru and parking lot so busy!

As we walked up (around 8:20pm), I was dreading the line we would find inside the store. The interior of this location is rather small so the line was to the door. Thankfully that meant only a couple handfuls of people (15 or so) were in front of us. 

Phew! 

The line moved quickly and we were out within 5 minutes with our FREE, warm, and freshly glazed doughnuts -- We ate those deep-fried pillows of goodness in less than 60 seconds!

Service was extra friendly that evening. An impressive feat considering how busy they were and must have been all day. Kudos to Krispy for continuing this awesome tradition that started back in 1938!

IMPORTANT INFO: For your evening doughnut cravings, this location's lobby area closes a couple hours before the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I went in for a dozen and after waiting for 20 mins, the lady behind the counter tells me they can't fulfill ANY orders until their \"big order\" is done. She offered an IOU but neglected to provide anything for this. Horrible service and I'm sure the line of people behind me weren't thrilled either. This location needs some serious training and performance evaluation."}
{"text":"Showed up at 5:30 in hopes of hot fresh donuts. Only to be served OLD donuts. I feel punished for waking up early for donuts."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot donuts. Good selection. Great service. Fast service. Hot coffee. Convenient in and out."}
{"text":"Advertise buy a dozen glazed get a dozen free by 930 in the morning they were out of glazed. You would think they would prepare more."}
{"text":"Review at the bottom-- Picky Much?  I love thats theres a Krispy Cream on this side of town now ! Drive thru is a plus donuts same delicious qaulity , customer service is fair Im happy there coming back way better than Dunkin in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm amazed by the way the manger handled my situation. I was upset with the drink I had and my donuts being cold so she made me a different drink and explained why the donuts are cold!! She was amazing and I wish all mangers took a lesson from her."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts! Staff are nice! They really do make sure the donuts taste fresh and if u got an issue they take care of it"}
{"text":"What's not to like.  Free samples. Warm glazy soft fresh donuts. Perfect standard issue for any cop."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. The people working were very nice. I don't think they necessarily knew how to make the specialty drinks. The donuts were fresh, but just not good. We ordered an iced coffee with vanilla flavor and it was just vanilla creamer, so that was gross. It was also a little sketchy of a location because all the other customers were either high or drunk - at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Too bad we didn't like this place because we were really excited when we saw it."}
{"text":"The donuts were amazing as always! I'd have given them a five star however the place could have been a little cleaner and the employees were arguing when we got in on who was supposed to be working which shift. However back to the products. The donuts were amazingly fluffy and perfect every bite. Something you don't get many places."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. 2 hours before close and already out of 3 choices. Then open up the box of donuts they did have and they look like they were made an hour before they opened. What happened to freshness and keeping up with items you run out of. Obviously to much to ask for even with your minimum wage increase. Do better or just close the doors."}
{"text":"What??? There's been a Krispy Kreme Donut Shop at Dobson and Main for two weeks and I didn't know about it?? I immediately canceled my errand on University and pulled into the Safeway parking lot. I've been craving a cream filled donut for weeks! But I thought the closest one was at Superstition Springs and I hadn't gotten out that far this trip. Okay, now to enjoy...."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Krispy Kreme and its sweet glazed goodness.  BUT I had to deduct stars because they gave me an incomplete order.  

My mom went in the other day ordering  a dozen varied donuts, but asked for the dozen to be split into two boxes (with six donuts each).  One box was for us, and the other was for a friend.  We ate one on the way because we couldn't resist the temptation.  When we got to our friend's house with the other untouched box, there were two donuts missing!  We couldn't even go and grab our box to switch it because we had already eaten one.  It was so embarrassing to bring a spacious box with four donuts (that should have been six!) to their house as a treat.  It made my mom and I look like we had eaten the two, and just gave them the rest.

Not cool, Krispy Kreme.  Maybe it was our fault for not double checking before we left, but we trusted them to place the 12 donuts we paid for into the boxes. :("}
{"text":"Today I was in the mood for doughnuts, but apparently at Krispy Kreme in Mesa AZ near Dobson and Main they stop making donuts at 9pm even though they close at 11pm. To top it off, they didn't give me the donut holes I ordered with my 2 dozen doughnuts. That's the last time I go to Krispy Kreme. Dunkin Donuts from now on."}
{"text":"Rude! Poor customer service. On top of that.. Ya'll are known for your glazed doughnuts.. How do you not serve them?!?! I asked nicely how long the wait is, and she replied, \"we are NOT serving them today.\" Probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(190/365)  \"Is The Light On?\"

If that light is on, I'm always tempted to get some original glazed doughnuts hot out of the fryer since we don't have a Leonard's Malassadas on the 9th Island. This trip, no light, no go....BUT...

I needed something real quick for a little potluck contribution we were having at church, and my first choice, Ronald's wasn't open, so this was plan B. The drive thru was very quick, efficient, and I just told the lady to throw a mix of flavors together, was on my way, and was a great choice. Good service, great price, and a definite hit!

Who doesn't love doughnuts?  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Delicious as always. And still adding new flavors great work everyone.  I am waiting on your take of the bacon maple doughnut.  I know you would do it proud."}
{"text":"Disappoint to be here and waist money for this .It doesn't matter about food but the customers service is rude and bad .."}
{"text":"I was sad when Krispy Kreme left Az and then was ecstatic when the stores were brought back. This is a pretty big location with a drive thru. There are only 3 locations in the valley. 

They do not offer the free donut when their light is on. (Bummer) this was a popular thing back in the day. They only offer bottled soda. But iced coffee and smoothies are offered as well. Service has always been nice and quick. My favorite thing is that they are on Uber Eats. (Sorry Yelp delivery) this has been a handy thing for me, for when  I have needed  donuts right away. 
My favorite donut is the chocolate glazed with sprinkles. I like how they change the sprinkles based off of the holiday or events going on. Still delicious as always.  Just buy some milk so you won't have any calories regret while you eat the delicious donuts."}
{"text":"Only reason i like KK is the taste of really hot and warm doughnuts. The ones i got were cold.  was really looking forward for some fresh doughnuts m. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The big draw for this particular Krispy Kreme store is that it is one of the \"hot light\" stores, meaning that periodically through the day, you will see the production line in action, and see the way the donuts are created right in front of you, and sometimes you are offered a fresh donut straight off the conveyor belt, just after it's passed through the glaze waterfall. Warm, goopy, vanishes in your mouth! Yum!

The donuts are great quality, and there's a good selection, with specials and limited editions occurring regularly. They also do a good range of hot and cold drinks, some American confectionery, and even Krispy Kreme merchandise.

The venue itself is big, bright and open plan, as it was purpose built. It only has a single (disabled-style) toilet though. It has plenty of seating, from booths, to tables and chairs, to bar-style seating, and seating outside. 

Being an American company, the staff are given training to ensure they have that perfect, friendly, American style customer service attitude, which makes you feel welcome, and happy. The staff are superb, and do their jobs excellently. 

This store also has a drive through, for if you want a sneaky coffee and a donut on the way home, but as it's open so late, you might as well pop inside and take your time!

My only slight criticism aside from the toilet issue is that the 'bar' where you get your sugar, milk etc, is well stocked (including sweetener, not just white/brown sugar), but only has napkins and doesn't have any wet-wipes, which with the type of glaze used on the donuts, would be very welcome indeed, as sticky fingers and paper napkins don't go well together! Come on, KK, if KFC can do it, surely you can!

The most fun thing to me aside watching the production line, is that there are free 1950's soda-jerk style hats around with the Krispy Kreme logo on, so grab one and put it on, especially if you're grabbing a box of 12 to take out... you need to look the part when bringing donut joy to your friends and family.... (unless you keep them all to yourself! OM NOM NOM NOM NOM!)"}
{"text":"Having a good customer service can go a long way,thank you Wesley for giving us an excellent service..."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this Krispy Kreme. Visiting Las Vegas and we wanted the hot original doughnuts, so we drove clear across town, get there, the hot light is on, sweet, get inside, ask for a dozen of the hot originals, we were given cold ones even though there were hot ones that had just come out, we were told those were for the free samples, counter help was rude and not accommodating at all. I would not recommend this Krispy Kreme location."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!! If it were possible I would have given no stars. They wouldn't give us the hot doughnuts even thO the hot sign was on and there were fresh doughnuts available. After asking for 1 dozen of the hot glass the worker grabbed a box from a rack in the back of the shop."}
{"text":"I came here on their 77th anniversary. Pretty good deal. Bought a dozen assorted donuts then the second dozen was all glazed for 77 cents. Can't beat that price!! Customer service was alright and placed seemed clean. Closest krispy kreme to me so if I ever get a craving for a nice, hot melt in your mouth glazed donut I'll be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars, but I don't know how to count. Kind of like how your employee doesn't know how to count donuts."}
{"text":"While waiting in a short line we were given a free donut,  delicious glaze.  Many varieties  from lemon glaze,  traditional,  chocolate etc.  Pleasant workers.  Stop on by you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Slow lines really slow lines, they don't offer the free donuts off of the conveyor belt arrr. This was one of the highlights of us visit in Phoenix area since there's no more Krispy Kreme donuts in Minnesota and my kids have never tried it before the staff here was kind of blasÃ© just shy of rude. If you're in the mood for Krispy Kreme try to find a different location."}
{"text":"So I made a mistake by coming back here thinking things would have changed. I had a craving for a maple glazed doughnut and stopped by. I figured it's 3:00pm on a Sunday they should have plenty. Well, I was wrong again. Shame on me for thinking they would have made any improvments."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Krispy Kreme in VA., I wouldn't even compare this location to VA.. The service, let's not go there, one word, terrible! I don't even know why they have a HOT NOW sign, does HOT NOW even exist here? This particular location needs new management or it needs to shut its doors for good."}
{"text":"I arrived here to try this location on National Donut Day, which is kind of like going to the mall on Black Friday, so I was definitely expecting to be a little patient. The line was 8-10 people long when I got there and it took about 25 minutes to be served. This was not too bad, like I said I was expecting a wait, however with only 1 staff member at the till when I first got there, which turned into 2, it seemed that for an anticipated busy day, there would be more staff available because after I arrived, the line only got longer.
Despite that, the ladies serving were lovely, smiling, asked about our day and did not let the busy day affect their rapport with the customers. I was served by the lovely Cymphony (can we take a second and appreciate the prettiest name ever!) and she got my raspberry filled glazed donut and hot cappuccino.
What I also liked about the serving process is that there is one area to choose your donuts and another to get your drinks and pay, so it's never too claustrophobic. 
The products are great! The small coffee is actually quite large (I'm British so it may just be the sizing I'm not used to) and therefore good value and the donut? Wow! I went here at 9am so just wanted to have a bite and save the rest for later but it all went! Just the right amount of glaze, the donut was soft and the best bit? The jam inside was very generous. It was full of jam and tasted amazing!
I drop a star because they could have had someone else to squash the line faster, but also the customer in front of me asked for a specific donut they said they were out of, but as soon as he left, a colleague showed up with a fresh tray. The communication between staff would have been nice so that all customers left with their perfect choice if it was possible.
Love this place and the staff though. Will return for my coffee and donut fix soon!"}
{"text":"I use to love this location. No matter what time I came in to buy doughnuts they were warm and fresh. Now I come in even in the am and I get cold hard seems like days old doughnuts. So sad..."}
{"text":"The employees are great. Sadly they removed the giant donut machine! The only thing that made them different from other donut shops. I took my kids to watch some donuts being made and buy them but the fun was gone. 
I ordered a coffee and a cappuccino. Worst tasting coffee of my life. Literally. Circle K is better. Their glazed donuts are delicious however all flavored donuts are gross compared to Dunkin Donuts and of course Hurts Donuts. Sadly with these things, I will no longer be a customer."}
{"text":"With a line out the door, National Donut day at this Krispy Kreme is certainly not being celebrated! They're running out of donuts, no fresh donuts coming off the conveyor belt and a lack of staff. Poor planning....shame on you guys."}
{"text":"Krispy Kreme!! Who doesn't love this place! The donuts are ever-so welcoming and always of course Kkkreemmyy as ever!

It's a great place to sit and relax and have a little sweet bite, while you see the fresh donuts make their way into the display shelf! If you're lucky to sweet-talk the staff, you might just get a hot glazed donut straight off the conveyor belt! Deliciousness personified! 

Kids love it, Adults love it and basically you're mood can never go sour or bitter!"}
{"text":"I waited in line at their promotion today for over an hour and they ran out of doughnuts before noon! Beyond angry I wasted 2 hours  on my day off work."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a few donuts and milk. The line was short inside. Received a free glazes don't while waiting. Very good service and all the donuts were fresh."}
{"text":"The worst ice coffee ever !!!!!! Bad Coustmer service ever ! I had told the guy I didn't like my ice coffee and I seriously tried to be nice , until he started giving me his attitude ! I had to walk out and throw that nasty shit away .!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I LOVE Krispy Kreme, but this location is not up to par. They do not make the donuts here, so you never get those fresh, warm, and delicious donuts that Krispy Kreme is known for. So if you want top notch donuts, go to the Superstition Springs location."}
{"text":"I was raised on real Krispy Kreame doughnuts. I grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana and was so excited to see Krispy Kreme come back to the valley. I live out in Goodyear so one opening up on 35th ave was a joy because i will drive for a good doughnut. I am so disappointed...This location gets the doughnuts in already made and sends them through a warmer then into the glazing machine. Yes you can serve hot doughnuts all day long but they are very stale..Ive tried this location at least 4 times and all 4 times it was at least a 15 minute wait and my doughnuts were not fresh at all. Boo to you Krispy Kreme for trying to cut corners because you cut all the quality out of a very yummy product. I just got back from California today and on the way home stopped at a real Krispy Kreme and my doughnuts even now after making a 6 hour trip are fresher than the ones i get at this Indian School Rd location."}
{"text":"It is a total shame that this company has any representation or relationship with the Golden Knights. The \"customer service\" was so foul I had to review. Very sorry that the Knights handed LA a donut last night. So sorry I drove 20m to your store to find a line 10-cars deep. So sorry that this marketing ploy drove so much business to your store that you ran out of doughnuts. The customers are why you have a business...not a harassment to the easy work shift you were hoping for."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts and speedy friendly service. Picked up a few donuts for some kids at my child's school who were great little helpers.  Who doesn't love a soft chewy chocolate donut with sprinkles?

Nice big KKD factory with windows to see the donuts being made!

$1 donuts, $7.99 for a dozen, not the cheapest but at least they're sweet and tasty."}
{"text":"Great donuts, easy to find and they were giving out free samples of whole donuts fresh off the belt from be oven!
Most of the employees were nice but one gal seemed to be having a bad morning and it showed through her attitude towards customers and her co-workers and I was surprised to see the baker in the back eating as he was preparing donuts."}
{"text":"It is Krispy Kreme for sure, but I was pretty disappointed on the taste of the donuts. They tasted like they have been sitting there for hours upon hours, and we showed up around 8am. They did not hav ethe \"fresh\" feeling that other KKs have been like. I am from the Winston-Salem area, where store #1 is, so maybe I am just a bit jaded."}
{"text":"I can eat half a dozen in one siting if I wanted to... do I ever? No, but knowing I can is impressive, right? ha! 

I know there are a lot of donut shops and flavors out there, but the Krispy Kreme plain glazed is the best. Simple, light, airy, and sweet. None of this too much frosting business going on with the original glazed. 

This location has a drive through if you don't feel like walking in to the store. 

Lastly, if you feel like being mesmerized, go into the store and watch the donut machine in action. It's quite incredible how simple donuts are to make, but maybe it's just the fancy machine they have."}
{"text":"I would have given a no star for this store but my review cannot b posted so i gave one star.

I came to this krispy kreme in the corner of Main st & dobson to claim my birthday coupon & buy also some donuts for my grandson.

The drive thru cashier said i cannot get soda becoz they only have bottled soda. I told her that all other krispy kreme branches would give soda whether in cups or bottles free or with charge.

Even dunkin donuts would give free soda
in bottles even if its a birthday coupon.

I dont know if she asked the supervisor but she came back twice to tell me i cannot have bottled soda. 

Krispy kreme gives ths gift as a customer service promotions. Whats the difference anyway?

I go to krispy kreme all the time. Its just that for a few cents, this store made a big deal about it. 

I came to this store feb 11 at around 2:15pm & they rejected my birthday free coupon. What a shame!

I hope management would read this comment & try to improve your system."}
{"text":"I drove though to pick up the double dozen for a client and they advised me the machine was broken so they had no glazed donuts. How is this possible and how did the make the other donuts?

Ended up driving straight to Winchell's."}
{"text":"It took 15 min to take my order through the drive thru and the worst part was there's no line and I paid $10 for 3 cold donuts and one melted drink. Was not worth my time. The service sucks. I love donuts. But wouldn't come to this location again."}
{"text":"Third visit the same young girl didn't offer the free sample. Yet after buying a doughnut and coffee I sat there and watched the next 9 people get handed (not even asked) a free sample by the nice older black woman that works there. Customer service is in the eye of the beholder.  In this case one has it.   The other will loose business for this location because it is strike 3 for me.  I am not the type to make a public scene and call attention to it over such a matter. But I am the type that  won't go back.  I will take my business elsewhere.   The workers there need consistent work policies to avoid offending customers.  But how can you complain about something conceivably free. Hmmmm."}

{"text":"great doughnuts, service and yummy coffee. good place to enjoy a relaxing coffee if it is not crowded! we got free doughnuts too."}
{"text":"They always have hot, original glazed donuts coming off the line and they always taste great. There is always a trivia question on the whiteboard and if you guess the right answer they'll give you another original donut for free. Coffee is pretty good too. I'll keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I dont like these place! Ppl are rude and mean! And take really bad care of customer service"}
{"text":"Took the kids here for some fresh donut while we waited for my mom at her Dr's appointment nearby. Should have just taken them to a grocery store for something MUCH better! Krispy Kreme is not what I remembered them to. Donuts were cold and overpriced. I don't ever mind paying a lot for some tasty donuts, but DAMN! What the hell happened to this place?! $8.99 for half dozen of the coldest donuts in the valley! Never again!"}
{"text":"So I love this Krispy Kreme.  I always get great customer service here.  They always have smiles on their faces and are ready to help you out no matter how busy they are.  Even late at night, they are very friendly and accommodating.  I think it is really important to instantly greet customers with a smile on your face for the customers to see.  It makes the whole experience a pleasant one and you leave with your doughnuts happy.  

I always get the glazed, they are delicious, and they always give me fresh warm ones.  I have yet to try their other flavored doughnuts, but the lady recommended the Oreo filled doughnut which was one of her favorites.  

They were very patient with me and nice to me while they were waiting for me to choose whether I wanted to get glazed or a different kind of doughnut, which I really liked because I don't like being rushed into make a decision especially when it comes to food. They even gave me a free doughnut for buying a dozen. I will always be coming here from now on! This is pretty much the only Krispy Kreme location I know of in the South West side and I am happy the staff are awesome too!  I give them an A++ for their customer service, cleanliness, and efficiency."}

In any case, got their 2doz deal, a dozen regular and a dozen assorted

have a friend that loves their Kreme filled one, not the boston cream, but their icing filled one! added a few lemon filled, sour cream, and maple ones to fill the mix

nice, quick, fresh doughnuts, what more could you want for a morning treat!"}

{"text":"God bless America!!!!!!!! No really, the mere thought of Krispy Kreme makes me want to belt out their national anthem!!! Sarah Anne M I respectfully whole heartedly disagree about the drive thru mockery!!! Are you fricking kidding me??!!! 

Drive thrus are absolute genius!!!!! The notion of too lazy to walk is slightly confused and rhetorical.... It reminds me of people who order a big fat donner kebab and a diet coke to go with it!!!! I'm sorry remind me aren't we buying doghnuts here??? Getting out your car and walking a few paces there and back isn't exactly going to compensate for you eating 5 sugary doughnuts is it?!! Besides I happen to be neither lazy nor vertically challenged!! This is pure and utter convenience option which is there should you decide to use it!! No one is forcing you to use the drive thru!!! 

Back to the sweet sugary business of heavenly treats from here. This is the best Krispy Kreme in Manchester...in fact I;ve never been to one that is better, that's probably because I haven't been across the pond yet!! The selection here is exceptional indeed. The original ones are just out of this world, and when you sink your teeth into a fresh hot one out the oven, it really is an indescribably feeling. As you leave Ikea stores, the food shop awaits you with its dime bars and that delightful soft ice cream. When you leave trafford centre after a late night movie or shopping session this place is a God send. 

Imagine the scenario; you have just walked a good 3-4 miles chasing the women in your life around in the trafford centre. You're tired and that meal at Rice is a distant memory. Blood sugar level are down, energy levels are down!! I dare your eyes not to pop out of their sockets at the mirage appearing before you in the distance as you drive out of the car park. The neon rainbow illuminating the sign, its like a light beaming at you from the sky,  almost divine. Little pleasures like these in life make you feel alive don't they??? Cynics amongst us sneer at these little pleasures belittling them and failing to get excited about the smaller pleasures in life. How greatful I am that none of my friends contain no traces of this cynical disease, what bright positive souls they are despite the troubles in their lives. I advocate getting excited at all times, and I guarantee Krispy Kremes will help you on your merry poppins way!!!"}
{"text":"krispy kreme is well know for there customer service. This was my first time to this location and I must say that the standards are not the same. When I walked in with my mother and grandmother there was a family of 6 putting in there order for a dozen donuts. Usually while your waiting the staff would take the time to acknowledge you by welcoming you and offering you a donut while you wait. None of that happen. The employee that was helping the customer gave us a look of annoyance. Which you can tell the mother and father notice but ignored it to feeling sorry for thier children not making up thier choices in donuts.  We then proceeded to the cashier where we asked for 3 medium coffees and 5 donuts. Ones we where done we didn't get your usual thank you for coming by see you again soon. Customer service and consistency is king in every buissnes. You can be down on the strip, Summerland, North town or spring mountain and rainbow the service has to be the same."}
{"text":"Crowded space and very busy, but donuts were very tasty and well priced. \"Large\" iced coffee are equivalent of a medium anywhere else. But good for a cheap breakfast. The red velvet iced coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"Yuck. Why choose this location to start up this tired franchise again. It's in not the greatest neighborhood. Greasy  tasteless doughnuts situated in a very dirty establishment."}
{"text":"I do love doughnuts, but these are way too sweet for me. I know all of my friends love them. They are made well and are always soft and fresh.. Tons of types to choose from and with coffee I'm sure its delicious..
But way too sweet for me...
I'm sure if you love sweet.. this is gonna be pure heaven to you.
enjoy"}
{"text":"What the hell is happening here? They were out of half the doughnuts we requested, and the ones we did get were the smallest doughnuts I've ever seen! The Oreo doughnut fit in the palm of my hand. If I wanted to hold something cute, I'd go to the animal shelter. 

The taste could've saved them from a one-star review, but alas, the outside was hard. Their \"hot\" sign was also on (which was the catalyst for going in the first place); but what do you know, they weren't hot. 

We don't get doughnuts often and we'll certainly never get Krispy Kreme again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Krispy Creme donuts and they have the best coffee, hot or iced! We highly recommend Krispy Creme to everyone near and far."}
{"text":"Terrible service the past two times I've been to this location. They always have some excuse of why they have no raspberry filled or strawberry filled. I think it's laziness. Go to the Terrible gas station and they'll have a better selection than Krispy Kreme itself. I don't drive all the way to a Krispy Kreme to be told that they don't have any of their good donuts lol. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"First of all, I love that it's open 24/7!
I was craving donuts and I went on yelp to check out the reviews. They were horrible. I was a little eh about coming in here but thankfully I didn't experience what they experienced. 

It's my second time coming here now and the customer service is by far the best I've had in any donut shop. And they give out free FRESH warm donuts!!! YAY."}
{"text":"We went to Krispy Kreme today which is buy 1 dozen get the second 79 cents. I understand it was super busy earlier and it was 8:30 when we went but the staff was so unprofessional. They were ignoring customers, mumbling, acting busy, picking up donuts with their bare hands, forgetting things, and just being plain rude. We waited 20 minutes to get helped with 2 people in front of us. Just kind of the most awful experience  ever. The guy with brown hair was the worst one out of all of them."}
{"text":"As if you have all day. The franchisee really should have enough help on duty to service customers efficiently. One should think there would be an escape lane in the drive through so customers aren't held prisoners at the whim of employees. Service was poor today and backing out of the drive through is hazardous. KK is tasty but pure sugar and grease. What grease do they use?"}
{"text":"59 minutes left til closing an no glaze donuts????? Is this laziness or mismanagement at this location??"}
{"text":"These are hands-down the best donuts I've ever had I don't care what anyone says they're awesome. And to get one fresh Lee made and warm is like a little bit of heaven. A nice treat anytime! If you have not tried them, ?, don't walk here to get some!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service refer to my tip from today."}
{"text":"Do not ignore the pattern of bad reviews merely because the concept of a pumpkin-cheesecake donut was crying out to you \"eat me! eat me!\" and it seemed like a good idea to not tackle Ranch Market on an empty stomach.

At 7:30 on Sunday morning, the store was empty of customers, the case was full of donuts, and my pumpkin-cheesecake donut was stale, while the coffee tasted burnt. Clearly, they were prepared for a lot more people to have shown up much earlier.

On the up side, the staff was very nice and the place was clean. I would happily go buy donuts from these same people if they could provide donuts that taste fresh."}
{"text":"We came here last weekend to cure the cravings that my family has had for donuts. I'm not a big pastry eater myself, but I am supportive of the family and their wants.

We walked in to a clean store and we were immediately  greeted by a young man with a very cheery disposition who was eager to help us with anything we needed or any questions we may have. I love great service!

 When my husband was busy checking out the goods, the young man offered us a sample of the original donut. \" Oh my gosh!\"  It was so warm,  so fresh, straight off the conveyor belt and it seemed to completely melt in my mouth!! Is this what I have been missing out on my whole life?! I know I never cared for donuts before, but I may have been converted ! \"My name is Tiffany and I love Krispy Kreme donuts!\"

Once our dozen was picked out he informed us that the donut holes were now cheaper with the purchase of the dozen donuts. Sweet!

Clean store, fast friendly service AND able to convert this gal, how could I do anything other than recommend this location?! :) Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I honestly have never had a bad experience at this location or Superstition springs.  The staff have always been helpful and friendly.  The last visit was at this location.  I came around 9pm through drive-thru and ordered a dozen glazed, I couldn't resist since the Hot light was calling my name!  No one ahead of me and one car behind.  I pulled up to the window and I know I was there less than five minutes, didn't seem long at all.  The young man handed me my HOT donuts and apologized for the wait and said, \"These are on the house.\"  Who does that!  Customer service at its finest.  5 Stars for this location. :)"}
{"text":"I went to Krispy Kreme at 7pm which is within their advertised 5pm-10pm hot doughnuts now light time. The light was not on and they did not have fresh doughnuts. When I asked the lady at the counter she said she didn't really know what time they did that. Anyway I ordered an assorted dozen and let me tell you these doughnuts were so stale I had to toss them when I got home. They were so hard the crunched when you bit into them. This is actually the 3rd time this happened at this location so for me 3 strikes you're out. For someone who is from the south I take my Krispy Kreme very seriously but this place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"not sure why I'm doing this......  Everyone knows Krispy Kreme Doughnuts are the King....    but anyway.....  as soon as you walk in, you see all this machinery....  then see the racks of doughnuts just waiting to be automatically deep-fried, and as you walk up to the counter to pick out a doughnut (or 2), an employee behind the counter asks if you would like a free sample, and reaches behind her, grabs a fresh, hot doughnut which had just got glazed about 30 seconds before, and hands it to you,  then you take the first bite, and let it MELT in your mouth......  and you are HOOKED.   \"I'll take a dozen, please\"....   THEN you see that they offer more than just the plain donuts......   the hardest time you will have is to pick out which one(s) you want.  Then working it off the rest of the week.  :)"}
{"text":"I am quite pleased that there is still one around at this point. In San Diego, they were all converted to Chic-Fil-A (however we don't have one of those here and they are the bomb). We used the drive-thru which was speedy but when I got the the picture covered drive-thru they did not have the Glazed Kreme filled listed as one of the choices. I asked the guy in the drive thru speaker if they had any and he said no. I asked if they had been discontinued, but he didn't respond. He then came back and asked how many I wanted, and I asked how many he really had. He responded 4, and we took all four. I am not sure why they told us that they didn't have any, or why its not on the sign anymore but in the end, I got my fave donut."}
{"text":"Ran out of glazed donuts and offered no compensation for my drive.  Bad management decisions."}
{"text":"This jersey girl couldn't resist stopping here for some late night donuts during a trip to Vegas, even after having stuffed myself at dinner. The extra calories are so worth it. To be fair, I shared my dozen donuts with my husband and our friends."}
{"text":"Wesley was amazing! Great customer service received from him 
Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This might be the first time I've felt old writing a Yelp review. I'm going to be straight up and say Krispy Kreme is not the doughnut juggernaut it used to be. In the last decade, people would be lined up for 30 minutes to get their hands on a freshly glazed morsel. It was the gold effing standard of breakfast sweets for years. 

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Although I appreciate my order being made fresh, it just wasn't the same as I remembered. They're a bit greasier than memory serves. Additionally, I'd avoid the coffee here. A large iced will cost you the same or more than similar products at competing breakfast chains, and at the same time be substantially smaller, and loaded with whole milk. Lame. 

In the end, I can't really complain because my coworkers still loved them, and I even enjoyed one. I just can't get excited about them."}
{"text":"5/5 for the donuts. 

1/5 for service.
I just left this place. I got off of work at 5:30pm. It was a long day full of crap so on my way home I decided to stop by and get some donuts. Everything went good up until, I started walking out. I found this to be very unprofessional. As I was walking out the guy that helped me said to the girl that was after me that he was glad to see her smiling and that most people don't smile anymore. She then went along and said, \"yeah, I noticed that. I always smile.\" I seriously wanted to turn around and say something but I chose not to. I don't know if this guy expected all females to flirt with his a** but I certainly didn't go along with it. I may not have been super excited while I picked out my damn donuts, but there was no need to go on talking about me to the next customer. This idiot doesn't know what I may have been through this day. I hope management sees this and informs his employees to keep their damn mouths shut next time a quiet, customer walks in."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them 2 stars because of the name, the doughnuts are good better than the local grocer but the wait here is unbelievable, while standing in line I watched 3 people say screw it and leave and there was only a total of 8 of us in line to begin with.I left home 15 mins early to give myself time to get in and get out and still ended up being 20 mins late for work. This is the 3rd time this has happened since I've been there so I won't be back."}
{"text":"What you order isn't always what you get. Order a snickerdoodle (which I paid extra for) and what I got was a plain donut. It was missing the sugar and cinnamon.  Why did I pay extra for a plain donut?"}
{"text":"Tonight they were out of donuts AGAIN. Apparently even glazed. THEN WHY AREN'T YOU CLOSED? No one is going to come get a coffee past 8pm.
Every time I come to this particular location, I'm faced with something irritating. They need to get their stuff together, really. Whether it's being out of donuts, or employees being sour and rude. I'll just drive down to the superstition springs location from now on."}
{"text":"Thanks to the team at KK and a special shout out to Suzanne L for helping us with 27 dozen donuts for a corporate event! They were fresh, ready on-time, and beautifully decorated with our logo and corporate colors!!!"}
{"text":"Having discovered Ronald's Donuts Apple Fritters several years ago I haven't been to any other donut hole since.
 My daughter and I earned a reward and we both that reward should be frosted and have some sprinkles.
 Really glad we came back here. Their plain glazed are still a warm favorite. The Easter decorated filled were a treat as well. We watched several batches cook as we ate. It was a chill, warm way to enjoy a meal of sugar and fats.   :)
 Plenty of tables, good coffees, most donuts warm.
  Give yourself a break today , have donuts with a kid."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over 10 years to pick up donuts for the kids on the the weekends.Last night at 2:40am on my way home I had a craving for donuts. Pulled up to drive thru ordered half a dozen donuts mixed, 2 sugar, 2 glazed and two cream filled. 8 bucks for half a dozen! Wth? 
Ok so I paid for them and as started to drive I decided to take a bite of one! Yuk! I thought it was just one donut that was stale but as I took a bit of another one it was more stale! I drove back through the drive thru piste off! Asked the guy to give me fresh donuts for the $8 dollars, he agreed! Gave me another box, he gave me the same week old donuts! Disgusting! I said to him these are old too, their stale & dry!! He said that's all they had! The cream filled was like a frosting not like the fresh whip cream they used to have! I came home and put them in a zip lock bag so maybe they would soften by morning! They were so disgusting I threw them out! I don't know if they are under new owner-ship or new management but they first make horrible tasting donuts the kind u get at the grocery store, old and stale. they taste watered down, no flavor, like dried bread with sugar! Vomit 
Please avoid this store at all costs! We used to buy donuts by the dozens for school charities and activities.i will make all the mom's and schools know how disgusting this place has become! Owners should close the store if they are going to sell crap for these prices!!"}
{"text":"I think that the donuts are A-OK when they are the prepped one. Though some flavors are good, many are very sweet and I can only have a bit before it's too much. I still think they're better quality in general than the other donut chains. 

I'm a fan though because nothing will make me act like a little kid than being handed a hot glazed donut. It's like crack addictive. 

Came for a work meeting....and I threw open the box to get them hands around hot donuts....no hot leftovers....how I didnt buy one more hot one is shocking. It's just a different texture, pillowy, chewy donut and the glaze just melts in the mouth since it's still not solid. 

Look for the making hot glazed donut now sign and go see what I mean."}
{"text":"KUDOS TO KRISPY KREME!!!!  

I AM EXTREMELY disappointed in Dunkin Donuts this morning. They are reported to be opened until 8 p.m.  I tried calling last night at 6:30 til 8 p.m. and again at 5 a.m. this morning. No one ever answered the phone.  At 5:20 a.m. I walked into the store and confirmed that I had the correct phone # and the employee confirmed that I did. I told him no one has been answering the phone since 6:30 last night.  I looked at the display and they barely had 1/4 of it filled.  I told him I needed a large order 25 dzn donuts (I didn't even care what kind they had available) and 25 boxes of coffee, I'd be willing to do it in smaller batches and come back throughout the morning.  He checked with the other employee and all they could do was 4 dzn and 3 boxes of coffee (even though there were 6 boxes on the shelf)  While he assembled my order, I called the next nearest location and they too couldn't fulfill my order and could only do 4 dzn and 3 boxes of coffee and she told me she too didn't even have enough because they just opened.  So instead I called Krispy Kremes and they said no problem at all, it would just take a little time to brew the coffee but that was the only issue.  I arrived in 30 minutes and other than waiting for coffee to brew they were able to fill my entire order with no problem at all, AND had no issues with the person behind me getting 4 dzn donuts .  Their displays were full and you could tell they were ready to do business unlike the empty displays at Dunkin Donuts.  I spent $500 this morning at Krispy Kremes. Dunkin Donuts is definitely not ready to play in the big leagues like the other companies.  They are only good for selling a single donut here and there to customers, not dozens!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 78/100***

This is the closest Krispy Kreme for us, so naturally, it has been our go to location when the mood for melt in your mouth glazed donuts strike. I have no complaints on the products, they're great especially when the lights are on and they're fresh and piping hot! They have several varieties: cake donuts, crullers, donut holes, specialty and seasonal donuts like the pumpkin spiced and of course the ever popular glazed. So good that you can never eat just one and should come with warning labels as they are very addicting!    

This particular location is very lacking when it comes to customer service though, I've had one too many undesirable experiences here. As a matter of fact, I can't recall a time when everything was just smooth sailing and didn't come across a hiccup. There's always something! 

Last Saturday I woke up with a hankering for Pumpkin Spiced donuts so we decided to cruise to Krispy Kreme. When we got there close to 10 am it wasn't busy at all with a few tables occupied and only one person ahead in line which was a relief as this place often gets crowded. As we were waiting I noticed the pumpkin spiced donut container was empty and no cake donuts on display. Before I could wonder further, the girl asked us if we were ready to order and gave us 4 samples. I told her we wanted a dozen of the pumpkin spice, even before I could finish she rudely interrupts and said they were out! I was caught off guard and repeated what she said and muttered how could you be out it's barely 10, she just shrugged with no explanation. I told her to give us a minute to pick something else, I asked if they had cake donuts and she gives me this look like I'm stupid and says \"Ummm, yeah!\" and I responded with \"Ummm how would I know they're not on display\" lol. Some guy had walked in behind us so I told him he could go ahead as we were still deciding. He declined and said he needed time as well. This girl then had the nerve to tell me and my family \"if you don't want to buy anything it's okay you can go\". So insulting! Like she was insinuating we just went there to get samples. In which I replied \"I was set on getting pumpkin spiced donuts it's not my fault you guys are out and now need a minute\". I would've made a bigger deal of it had my kids and mom not been there plus it was early and I haven't even had my coffee yet JEEEEZ! Even my son commented on how rude she was and said \"Give them ZERO stars on YELP mom! Hahahaha.

Ended up getting a dozen of assorted donuts but I was sad because I really wanted my pumpkin spice, until I remembered Mavericks carries Krispy Kreme, lo and behold they had them there and all was well again LOL."}
{"text":"5/5 on glaze doughnuts but the HOT LIGHT hours sucks. They never follow through the hot light hours they posted by the door and drive-thru (which is 5am-11am and 5pm to 10pm). Been coming back here on those hours and hot light always off. It's a waste of time and trip. Now we're stuck but to buy what they have on the shelves. This is so un-professional and they'll loose customers for this."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and my last time yesterday will be my last. First visit we went in and well the lady was rude. If you dont like your job or dealing with people find another job. 2nd visit was 2 weeks later and we went through the drive thru. Not only did the lady NOT get the order right which by the way was 6 boston cream and 6 cream filled. She shorted us 2 doughnuts and gave us a variety of doughnuts none of which we ordered. 3rd time was yesterday which would be a month later from our 2nd visit. Again the person working the window could not count and gave us 11 doughnuts and well the doughnuts were hard. Not like cold hard but like day old hard doughnuts. We went around 3pm. If you go to this location make sure you count your doughnuts cause someone can't count. I prefer now to just go the extra mile literally from where I live to the one on Alma and Ray. Much better."}
{"text":"Not made fresh. Donuts are cold and they don't have a way to warm them up for you. You might as well go to Safeway and get their donuts there and warm them up at home."}
{"text":"This location was a few miles down the road from our hotel.  We decided to get donuts for breakfast on the road trip back to Cali!! We've only visited KK shops while we are in Az and have yet to be disappointed by the donuts, service and cleanliness of the store. The lady who helped us was SOOOO NICE she gave my little ones hats and even let them sample a donut hole because they couldn't decide if they wanted donut holes or a specialty donut... they ended up choosing the donut holes. My only negative comment is they don't have to huge donut making machine at this location  it looks as if at one point they may had one but this is no longer the case. The kids were a tad bit disappointed. All in all this was a pleasant experience and since we only get KKs while on vaca this everybody was happy with what they got."}
{"text":"I have no idea what's going on with the customer service lately but it seriously needs to be amended. There's two older women that work here and they are just as rude as you can possibly imagine! I simply asked for 4 original glazed donuts and a cup of ice water and they rudely told me to pull up the front. When the lady forgot my water and I politely reminded her, she scoffed at me and walked away from the window. On top of that, I asked for napkins and she practically threw them at me. I love Krispy Kreme donuts, but the staff here are so impolite and disrespectful."}
{"text":"In the words of Homer Simpson...\"mmMMMMmmm!  Doughnuts!!  aAARR!\"

We just picked up some hot, fresh-off-the-line doughnuts at Krispy Kreme in Chinatown - dessert for the keiki!  What made it more special this time around was that they had some of their tasty treats decorated in the spirit of the holiday, Halloween!  BOO!  As always, we bought a dozen so the kids can devour them over the weekend with a few of their friends coming over tomorrow - makes for a perfect snack!

I don't know how many of you may know this, but the Krispy Kreme on Spring Mountain is also one of their doughnut factories (not all KK locations are tied to their factories here in LV).  When you see their HOT neon LIGHT on, it means that their Original Glazed doughnuts are hot off the belts!  We try to make it there around the time they have their HOT LIGHT on!  They offer a freshly made, warm, melt-in-your-mouth Original Glazed straight off the belt...FREE!  Well, it's free if you are purchasing something.  What a treat, right?!?  So far, we've known them to make fresh ones right around 11am and 5pm; I could be wrong though (about the time).

So, for anyone interested in going in to a Krispy Kreme to see, or taste, what all the hype is about, visit when the HOT LIGHT in ON!  You will be able to sample one of the most tempting, sumptuous treats your mouth has ever experienced!  I know all you Hawaii people looking to get their Krispy Kreme fix on will be there!!!  Don't forget to bring your dozens back home to your family!"}
{"text":"I love love love krispy Kreme doughnuts, especially when you enter and take a sniff of the freshly baked doughnuts they are making and then they hand you a free original glazed.  Yummmy! 

I love their chocolate glazed doughnut, it is my favorite! I dislike their red velvet doughnut! I had to try it out at least once and it wasn't a hit for me.  

Overall, great tasting doughnuts and fast service.  What more can you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"Used drive thru for this visit. The light was lit. I had to stop. Ordered a half dozen glazed. Service was prompt and fast. Employees were nice and friendly. Doughnuts were warm. Tasted good. Very fresh. Very good experience."}
{"text":"Good donuts, fresh, always a treat to pick up a dozen or so to share with co-workers.  We first moved to Vegas, it was fun trying the different donut shops, now that we have been here a while, Krispy Kreme has stayed fresh."}
{"text":"You never know what a good doughnut taste like until you've had a bad one. This place rocks. Krispy Kreme always has really great promotional deals too. Make sure to check out their website and sign-up to be a part of their club/mailing list. My favorites are the original glazed, sour cream old fashion, old fashion, bear claws, lemon filled and raspberry filled. They are all really great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge doughnut fan but friends of mine are. We winged in for a box to go and everybody liked them. I thought they were OK and would've dropped 3 stars on KK but the girls were really friendly and deserved a bump up."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! This location has a drive-thru & everything is always fresh. Fast & great customer service!"}
{"text":"We had fun here tonight. My Significant Other has never been at a Krispy Kreme manufacturing store so we had a good time watching the dough travel through the stages of production.  We started joking about the mistakes- the blobs that weren't properly shaped, the dough that didn't brown on both sides, etc.  One of the employees saw us and came out to join us. He was so funny, and very knowledgeable about his work. He said it takes 41 minutes to make a doughnut, and described some of the process. It's great to know your food is being made by such an enthusiastic and positive person! He made our day.

Oh, and the doughnuts are HEAVEN."}
{"text":"I buy donuts for my school often and because Krispy Kreme had a great deal for teachers, I frequented this location. I went this morning to get the first 5 doz of my end of school week & the girl at the counter (Dorothy) informed me that they would no longer give a discount for anything less than 10 doz at a time. That was frustrating but ok. I handed her my tax exemption status and she still charged me tax. I don't know if this new policy will help Krispy Kreme, but looks like I'm shopping for a new donut place tomorrow."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever (don't even try to argue that Dunkin Donuts is better).  But due to health reasons, I eat maybe 2 a year.  My wife on the other hand can eat up to 4 in one sitting.  Its great that this place gives free samples so often when you go in to buy them as opposed to drive through.

The staff even gave my wife a discount on donuts a few times cuz they thought she was hot.  She once got 4 donuts and only got charged 75 cents and then another time they just threw in 2 extra hot originals in her bag!!  Crazy!!"}
{"text":"I was at work one day and a group of people came in wearing their Krispy Kreme swag. So naturally I asked them where my doughnuts were? Haha. One of the ladies actually said she knew someone was going to ask her so she came prepared and handed me and my co-worker a FREE dozen doughnuts coupon! Score. Time for some melt in my mouth original glazed doughnuts! 

When I walked in, I was quickly greeted by a lady who asked if she could help me. I noticed my coupon given to me a few days prior was expired. I explained to her one of the managers came into my work and gave it to me recently. The lady said not a problem and honored my coupon. Yaay! I order a dozen original glazed doughnuts and a small vanilla iced coffee. The coffee was delicious! And I took the doughnuts to work for my co-workers because if I took them home I would eat them all haha and I'm trying to watch my weight! But the staff and I loved them. They were a huge hit! But I wasn't surprised. They are melt in your mouth delicious! 

Pros: this location has a drive thru, their hours (opens at 5:30 am), the staff was quick and friendly, free samples!, the reasonable prices, and the window used to watch the doughnuts come off the conveyor belt. 

Cons: small shop, would've liked this location to be a bit cleaner 

Tip** the original glazed are a classic and the best!!"}
{"text":"This store has a huge attitude. I ordered a doughnut and a coffee for National Coffee Day. The ladies were rude and handed me and my daughter cold, hard doughnuts. I asked if we could have fresh ones and this one girl glared at me and told me that was all that there was. 
Then i waited in line for about 5 minutes waiting for my coffee. They claimed to be making more, but they were giving coffee out to everyone else.
When i finally got mine they just pushed it towards me and said \"here\" and went back to playing games and giggling even though there was a big line behind me. 
The manager (i think that is who he was) was very nice and apologetic. We told him about the doughnuts and he went and made us fresh new ones. He was the only guy that was kind at this store!
Because of the service from the 2 ladies, i will probably not go back, though.."}
{"text":"I came to this location because the one on Eastern was closed for remodeling. It was quite busy due to that. I was here at 7am sharp and the \"light\" was on, so I knew the original glaze would be super fresh! I ordered 4 dozen glaze for my co-workers since I'm an ass kisser, and like to keep the other employees I work with happy. This location is right off spring mountain in the Walmart shopping center. Clean and well kept just like the others I've reviewed in the past. No complaints whatsoever. I'm sure I'll be back since the one closer to my job is closed for the time being."}
{"text":"They are usually never open on time, after 7pm they are out of most of anything popular guessing because they don't make it actually at their location, sometimes they are not even open when the online site says they are. Needs new management or owners to revamp it's name because it failed me twice now, will I give them a 3rd shot most likely not. I'd recommend going anywhere else other than this location or you could be making a trip for nothing.   Duncan Donuts is not far hate to say they've been having way better selections all throughout the day!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place! The food was hot and fresh. The service was fast and incredible friendly. I enjoyed. A nice little laugh here with my wife on our date night. Paul was very helpful for us. I was asking questions about the machinery they use to make the donuts and he was very knowledgeable about what they have at several locations. Truly an enjoyable conversation. I don't normally fill out surveys online but I will definitely be doing the one they offer on the receipt so I can receive a free box of donuts next time I visit. Highly recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome selection of goodies. More than helpful and fresh on the spot.  Store crew was helpful for there are some treats we haven't had...birthday cake and the brownie batter?  Yep, surely can't be a bad way to start the morning. Don't forget the milk!"}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm in the mood for some donuts. I'll be honest here, I'm not a big fan of sweets, but boy do I like me some fresh warm cooked donuts when I have a sweet tooth. I like the idea how they have a little observation area where you can watch the employees (or should I say machine) make the donuts and watch the employees pick out the fresh donuts.

I will never buy donuts anywhere else besides this place. Gotta have the known glaze donuts every time I come here. Not much of a chocolate or sprinkles fan, but my son sure loves all those different toppings on e'm.

NOTE: Don't for get the milk!"}
{"text":"Worst donuts!!! I came 26 minutes before it was supposed to be closed. And as I walked to the door. The workers turned off the lights. Apparently they don't want business. Will never come to this place again.  As a result of them closing early I have called corporation. If this is a franchise I hope it gets taken over."}
{"text":"(Yay My 40th Review!!)
Ok just to set the record straight MOST corporate donuts suck! They are certainly special because of there recipe that makes 'em' feel like you're biting on a cloud but they scream Heart Attack!! As I'm sure you're thinking a kid my age shouldn't worry about that but I am just pointing it out for everybody. Not only that but about after 4 you get a little sick."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience. I don't think I'll be coming back here for a while. 

The plan was to use the drive thru and get a dozen assorted donuts for the office. Also, get a cup of coffee too (pretty easy, I thought).

What resulted was a dozen plain donuts, no coffee, and no receipt. Plus it took so long I was late to work when I had left 15 minutes earlier for my commute.

Sucks that the poor kid, looking stressed and overwhelmed, didn't even know my order. Felt bad but the problem seems to be as simple as poor management."}
{"text":"They were out of original cream flavoring for my latte and then I ordered a batter doughnut and original glazed doughnut both were served to me cold through the window and I asked if I could have them warmed up and the gentleman looked me dead in my face and said \"we can't do that\"  #underwhelmed #disappointed #alwaysfreshNOT"}
{"text":"The glazed when warm are my hands down favorite donut to eat. I absolutely love them. They are like little pillows of sugary goodness sent down from Heaven."}

Krispy Kreme!! I LOVE THE HOT DONUTS!!                                                               

I like going to this location when the light is on that the donuts are hot. They will give you one of the free glazed hot donuts if you ask for your sample!! 

Of course when you buy them hot and go out to the car your always tempted to have another!!

So gooey,light and soft & hot they are the best!! 

I don't understand why there are not more of these around town in more convenient locations. I am not always on spring mountain or wanting to go into a casino to get donuts. And I have bought in the convenient stores but just not the same! 

I am a fan of these! Nice to bring home a dozen or 2 and I freeze them pop them in the micro for a few seconds and it is like they were made fresh! 

There was only one time I remember going in this location that there was a rude girl working ever since I have not seen her. It didn't stop me from going in because of her. 
These donuts are a treat and it is not like I am having to deal with her on a daily basis if she still works there. 

I do however like a few others they make like the raspberry filled yummy! 

Keep the good donuts coming and don't let the competition take over!!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of these doughnut shops left so had to stop by. Very clean inside. staff was friendly and helpful. Well stocked for midday on saturday. The originals I got came from some special storage spot so they were incredibly fluffy and warm."}
{"text":"Donuts are way to sweet and tiny. The coffee is good, but you can't get free refills.
I rather have Bosa or Lamars donuts. The staff can be a little friendlier too.
       Also they were out of 6 kinds of donuts by 9:20 am. Including cake donuts."}
{"text":"I visited this location today and to my delight was greeted by Maria. I did only use the drive thru so I'm unaware of the conditions indoors, but from what I experienced in the drive thru I'm sure it's spectacular.

I pulled into the drive thru and it didn't take long to hear Maria's lovely voice over the speaker box. I asked her for some time to decide on what I was looking to pick up because I wanted an assorted dozen. (Mmm)

I was given ample time to decide and did not feel rushed in the slightest. So I said I was prepared to order and Maria was there in a jiffy just as prepared if not more prepared than I to take my order. 

So I gave her my order flawlessly and she received in perfectly. I then pull up and she had my total for me at the window. We continued the exchange as any drive thru exchange would continue until the very end. 

This is where Maria really showed that she and her shop are a cut above the rest. She leans out the very narrow drive thru window risking intense sun burn and heat exhaustion in this Arizona (nearly) summer heat to ask me if I need any napkins. I was impressed with her bravery and care. I requested just one napkin because I only thought I would need one. But Maria leaves and swiftly returns with my donuts and hands them over to me and then tells me that she has given me two napkins. Turns out Maria knows me better than I even know myself. Maria, You and your gracious heart have made my day and I will surely be back. 

Thank you Maria and the entire Krispy Kreme family."}
{"text":"I came in one person was ahead of me the guy helped her. I was waiting the guy skipped over me and started helping someone else. Another came up to help me and she told me the donuts weren't ready on the belt. I then asked do you have donut holes she said let me check and come back with them. There was two cashiers and they both walk away then the lady who came after me but was helped before me again, was helped but it took both cashiers to help her. I was ready before her. They then walked alway again for who knows what reason. I left I felt completely ignored. By multiple people on multiple occasions in one visit."}
{"text":"Typical chain doughnut store.  Very similar to Dunkin Donuts.  Average service and selection.  Since I've been to an original KK, this place is a little bit of a let down.  They do have the \"fresh\" light, letting you know when the doughnuts are piping hot off the line!  If you are looking for more creative and tasty morsels...try Pink Box or AJ's."}
{"text":"There are doughnuts and then there is Krispy Kreme. There are times I just want a doughnut and times I want a Krispy Kreme doughnut. And lately, it has been the latter. Something about a hot glaze doughnut just brings a smile to your face. While they are not as cheap as your local doughnut shop, the airy goodness inside of them makes up for the difference. Plus with the seasonal Christmas doughnuts they tend to have, it just makes it all that much better. 

Fortunately for me, I can only put down two to three of these before I want to run the other way. Something about how sweet they are I guess."}
{"text":"I have been deprived of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts for most of my life.

For the 20+ years that I lived in Hawaii, there was no Krispy Kreme location on Oahu. The only time I could eat these awesome doughnuts was during my rare vacations in California. I would say maybe a year or so before I moved to the OC, they finally opened a location on the islands! How exciting right? But it was on Maui, booo!! There were stores around town who sold Krispy Kreme that has been flown in, but seriously, it's just not the same!  So then I move to the OC, and of course there is no location in my city! The nearest one is about 9 miles away. *sigh* I have no other choice but the Donut Star that is near us.

Anyway, I just have to stop here at least once whenever we are in Vegas. Who doesn't love their hot and fluffy original glazed doughnuts that practically melt in your mouth? The employees here always have a smile on their face, gotta love it when the \"Hot Now\" sign is on and they hand you a free doughnut! It's also fun to walk in and see everything being made. They really are THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"As you saw in my picture a African American woman who works here saw me pull out a couple hundred $ to pay for my order and says \"been selling a little weed huh\" omg I've never been so appalled in my life. I want her fired I am a hard working college graduate & to have someone insinuate I'm a drug dealer is disgusting. I really wish the manager or some higher power would contact me. This is NOT ok"}
{"text":"Mal servicio, por parte de una seÃ±ora que nos atendiÃ³, ha todo decÃ­a que no, no tienen leche deslactosada, no habÃ­a popotes, las mesas de afuera sucias."}
{"text":"Great doughnuts!  Always stop by there, when I'm in the area.  So convenient and right by the light rail station."}
{"text":"We NEVER splurge on Krispy Kreme but did this morning.  I ordered an assorted dozen (I picked).  I went to the window and the snappy girl said you ordered the assorted dozen right?  I said yes but I picked what I wanted.  She gets pissed slams the window shut.  A minute later comes back with another box and I could see a chocolate sprinkle so I thought it was mine.  I pay and she hands me the receipt and says, \"Thank you beautiful.\"  I guess that was supposed to make up for the earlier snarkiness.  No one ever offered me a freebie for National Donut Day.

I get home and open the box- NOTHING except the chocolate sprinkles was what I ordered.  No sour cream glaze.  No chocolate glaze.  And the donuts we did get were not very fresh.

Last time we will go here."}
