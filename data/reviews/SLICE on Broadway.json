{"text":"I ordered the Athena pizza and I was very disappointed.  There was so much oil on the pizza.  The crust was soggy."}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pizza I've had in Pittsburgh no joke. The bottom was actually crispy too, we only got sausage and pepperoni but I'm really glad we stopped here. Everyone working there was cool to talk too as well. I will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Another stop in our quest for acceptable pizza, Slice at the ballpark was just fine on a Monday night. We had a margherita and a Frisky Billygoat. The pizzas were tasty, the people were nice.  The Pirates were not playing that evening, so I can't speak to what the atmosphere might be during a game. I am sure we will be back; This is really a 3.5 star review."}
{"text":"The South Hills of Pittsburgh already has a few staple pizza joints. They are each unique and delectable in their own right. Betos, Fioris, and Campitis just to name a few...So, the competition in this area is quite stiff. Though Slice on Broadway more than holds its own. It's new and fresh, and nothing like the others. Their margherita  pizza is what keeps us going back. When we switch it up, the Athena never disappoints. By far, they have the best salads of any pizza place that I can think of. They use fresh greens and spinach, and their portions are quite generous. They definitely have an advantage since they deliver too! All in all, the pizza is where the magic is, and this place has it. Definitely my new favorite pizza place in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I just now discovered this place ... had two perfect slices that would make a New Yorker weep with nostalgia. The next time I will order a whole pie! Go here ... eat!!!"}
{"text":"Your marketing people should be fired, if you have any.  You advertise in the Pirates booklet that is handed out at every game and offer 15% off.  This 15% is not honored on the days the Pirates in town....I'm sure you are very busy on game days despite this.... I am a season ticket holder and will never taste what you say is delicious pizza.  I will take my business to Atria's who also advertises in the same booklet and doesn't have fine print like you do.   They are using their advertising dollar wisely."}
{"text":"The crust is awesome - really special, with a fabulous chewy texture and yummy sourdough-like flavor.  They use baby bellas for their mushroom, which I really liked, and their sauce is quite good (needs crushed red pepper, but most places do).  Their delivery area is huge, so I'm thankful they deliver, just keep that in mind - and if yours has arrived with a soggy crust, order something with just a topping or two next time, you'll be happier."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience. The pizza is made with a lot of attention to detail and has fresh ingredients and the proper proportions of each element. It's definitely one of the highest quality pizzas around the city. The owner is incredibly friendly and generous, and the staff was very nice. They really care about their business, and it shows."}
{"text":"Its ALL about the cheese. My hands down favorite pizza regardless of the toppings. This pizza takes me back to the delicious imported cheese pizzas of my youth. Mouth watering taste and enough cheese to cut your dough intake in half! This is a pizza that keeps you coming back for more."}
{"text":"We ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza. Flavor wise it was okay. The main turn off how how greasy the base was. My hands were coated with grease and afterwards my mouth felt all greasy."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Super bonus points for using fresh mushrooms. I love the chewy crust and sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while we were staying in Pittsburgh. Staff was friendly and the stuffed pepper pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"Good, solid pizza place. Its now my picky significant other's new favorite pizza place.

Their pizza is good. It a thin crust and very crisp. So crisp, that when you take a slice there's no fear of ripping a delicate piece it because it just snaps. The sauce is bright and sweet. Their sauce to cheese ratio is heavy on the cheese and light on the sauce. Good quality cheese and overall good quality of toppings."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaiian. The crust was chewier than I expected although that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The ham was sliced thin but was too long. Taking a bite into the pizza, more of the ham came along and I ended up with sauce on my shirt. There was so little cheese I thought it was a cheeseless pizza at first. Really, what kind of a pizza place skimps on the cheese?"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh. When a place is called \"slice,\" you'd think the slices would be something special.  Instead, they have pre-made plain pizza, add whatever toppings you want, and stick it back in the oven.

I think I would like Slice more if people would stop calling it the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Had their cheese and their pepperoni slices definitely good pizza nice flavor good size slices for a couple bucks you can't beat it. Definitely worth coming back to"}
{"text":"Other pizza in Pittsburgh doesn't even exist. This is it. Slice has the best selection of pork products to put on your pizza as well. The staff is also incredibly friendly. Now I never have to set foot in New Jersey ever again because there is finally great pizza in the city. Apologies to New Jersey you also have many cured pork products I enjoy."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Pizza and hoagies I have ever had. Stopped back in the old neighborhood an found this amazing place. I now drive more than 30 minutes for pizza... Ya it's that good. I've had the Guido, veggie, and the cheese Steak pizzas and the Caprese hoagie. All fantastic. I usually don't get excited about pizza but I have eaten pizza all over and this is some of the best anywhere. Go to slice if you like pizza!"}
{"text":"First time customer,ordered a salad ,regular pie w a few toppings and the Fancy Pants pie...all were excellent ...a must,especially if you like thin crust..the salad was all fresh greens with lots of veggies"}
{"text":"This is without question the best pizza I've had in the city.  Great ingredients, great staff, great philosophy of quality.  Just go."}
{"text":"We've ordered the Slaughterhouse Five pizza twice for home delivery. The toppings and sauce are delicious but the crust is always way underdone, totally floppy, can't even pick it up off the box it's so dough-y.  I had to finish cooking it at home and by then the toppings were overcooked. I don't see why this place has so many good reviews, their crust needs some serious work because it's limp, tasteless and nearly raw.  I will not order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh toppings, friendly service. Very good salads and the hoagies are not your typical pizza shop sandwich. They're top-notch."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had.  My husband is a native New Yorker and this is better than any pie I have ever had in NY or anywhere for that matter.  The staff is wonderful and the delivery drivers are friendly and professional"}
{"text":"Great customer service and even better pizza. We had 2 specialty pies, the slaughterhouse and the buffalo chicken... Amazing

Everyone needs to support a local business like this, we will be back again."}
{"text":"Slice is the best thing that's happened to Beechview, and to Pizza! We were greeted by a super-friendly staff, and were able to order a sub a la carte fro my son who has celiac disease. The ingredients were fresh, the food delicious, and the experience fabulous!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and the pizza was NOT in my top 10 in South Hills let alone the top in Pittsburgh. Asked for something specific. When delivered, it was wrong. When we called, the person who took the call was rude. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get some lunch and this place had great reviews. Their great reviews are definitely for good reason.  We were warmly greeted upon arrival, and everybody was extremely friendly. We ordered a large sausage pizza which was outstanding, a anti-pasta salad which was gigantic fresh and delicious, and a really top notch toasted Italian sub. I am pretty sure that the guy helping us was the owner, which was really great to see him working on New Year's Day. Even the delivery guy asked me if everything was all right with my meal as he walked past. That kind of service and friendliness is what makes this place a five star rating. Highly recommended. Oh yeah, and the little pizza rolls they sell are killer, I could make a whole meal just out of those..."}
{"text":"With out a doubt the best pizza in the Burgh. And moving here from the NY tristate area I know a great pizza from your gazillion cut wee tiny pieces Pittsburgh pizza."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I moved here a couple weeks ago and have our temporary licenses. When we went to buy a beverage before the pirates game the lady said it was their \"personal policy\" not to serve anyone with temporary licenses. I didn't know restaurants could trump state laws. The lady was very rude, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I also heard other customers complain about how they were being treated during their visit. The customer may not always be right but they're the one paying your pay check.. might want to remember that if you're going to run a successful business."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Carnegie. Love the NY style thin crust and generous toppings.

This is a highly recommended lunch option and is great food for a Sunday football party."}
{"text":"Came in after the Bengals V Steelers game and girl at the front register stated we're trying to close. When I asked for a menu she stated cheese or pepperoni. She was very rude and didn't care for the fact she was talking about the customers right in front of them. Don't come to Pittsburgh often but it's the last time I come here."}
{"text":"We have always liked Slice and have supported it since it opened. The hoagies are very good (especially the Luca and the gonzo). The salad is wonderful. All of the pizzas are delicious (the big Lou and the Athena).  We enjoy mixing and matching and have a few favorites. It is so nice to see good toppings, even premium toppings, at a reasonable price.

Recently, however, I am wondering if their popularity has made them have growing pains. There is now expanded seating and you can get beer by the bottle. You can take out beer as well. They are always busy and there seem to be an increased number of employees helping to cook and deliver and serve. Sometimes it is just very hectic there.

Last week, I tried to get a take-out order and ordered it as I walked up to the cash register. I kept waiting and waiting and people who were after me got served first with their order. Finally, I guess as I was looking a little bewildered, someone asked me if I was being helped. When I explained that I already had put in my order and it paid for it and have been waiting for it, they checked and it was not even started yet. I had to wait a long time and eventually receive the order. To compensate for their air, they did give me a little bit extra. Fine.

I went back the very next day and called in order on the telephone. I doublecheck to make sure that they got the order right. When I got there, I still had to wait longer than they promised. I took the order, paid for it, asked the man at the checkout register if it was the right order. He said it was. When I got home, and opened the box, the order was wrong. It was  red pizza instead of white pizza even though the toppings were right.

All of this is just to say that, Slice is a good place. I will continue to go there. Just please doublecheck your order, be patient, and don't leave without making sure the order is correct."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place!!  Great pizza and bigger better portions than the chain pizza places. And cost less!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh.  The ingredients are very fresh and their specialty pizzas are delicious.  Their salads and hoagies are great too. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been in Pittsburgh since '93 but lived most of my life (20 yrs.) in New York. 
Just want to qual my pizza resume.  This is the best Pizza I have had since moving here and I am a pizza whore.  This is a group of people that are working their asses off to provide the most delicious, creative offerings in pizza and sandwiches.  You must go, you must experience!  This place is the real deal and I freaking love it."}
{"text":"This was a great pizza for a great price. It was a thinnish pizza but the flavors of the crust were really prominent. They also have great ranch."}
{"text":"Went with my boys... and we were pleased to find NY style pizza in east end without having to drive up to Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time and I have to say I am pleased with everything I ordered it was a deal a huge pizza two toppings,two hoagies,large order of bread sticks,& a 2liter of Sprite!!"}
{"text":"Anyone that has given this place less than 5 stars has no clue what good pizza is supposed to be like. Slice is consistently great, timely, always friendly, and one of my favorite pizza places of all time.  Crunchy crust, thin pizza but not so thin it falls apart, perfect cheese to sauce ratio, not overly greasy, sauce is there but not overly present, cheese is the perfect blend of saltiness, gooey delicious perfection. It's like the pizza from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon from the late 80s/early 90s came alive and tastes just as amazing as you thought it would when Michelangelo downed like 8 slices in 3 bites. Try it, you will love it. And if you don't, go back to Chicago you thick crust loving freak."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Loved the crust especially.  Will definitely be back again.  Worth crossing town for."}
{"text":"Owner and employees exceptional.  Pizza was fantastic.  Service was quick.  Price was appropriate."}
{"text":"Today, Sunday, March 22nd, in the year of our Lord 2015, we visited what too much time on Yelp has led us to believe is the last pizza place anyone in Pittsburgh need ever visit. We visited SLICE on Broadway.

We were immediately faced with a choice here, and I hoped that we would not falter.

'Should we get one of their specialty pizzas everyone raves about or go the route of a standard pizza with some Italian meat on it?'

Entire seconds passed as we agonized over this most important decision of the day. We chose the latter. Specifically, we ordered a small hot soppressata pizza to split, as well as a pepperoni roll and a steak and onion roll.

We appeared to be the only people dining in at the moment but we headed upstairs to check it out anyway. What can I say other than that it's really obvious how that location used to be a house and how oddly endearing that is.

Our rolls were brought to us very quickly. They were better than expected. They set expectations for the pizza crust very high. Most pepperoni rolls I've had have had too much dough and not enough payoff. These were essentially perfectly balanced to the point where the sauce and ranch we got for dipping were nearly redundant. I will say that the steak and onion roll was amazing and noticeably better than the pepperoni. I would absolutely order a few of those again.

Our pizza was not far behind it, coming up the stairs for us probably only 10 minutes after we sat down. It looked beautiful, the meat atop it most of all. And who can say no to the little pockets that sometimes rise from a pizza, announcing their home slices as prime eating. My first impression of the pizza was that I was impressed by the sturdiness of it. They make them pretty thin here, but the slices hold up very well en route to face. The next thing I noticed was that each element of the pizza worked together so well that it was a full unit. It became difficult, in a good way, to differentiate between sauce, cheese, and toppings. It was like eating a Professionally Manufactured Pizza Product - this too is a compliment. The crust tasted to me like it was very light on flour and perhaps heavy on cornmeal. Is that a thing? I don't know, I'm not a Professional Pizza Manufacturer. Either way, my mouth was telling me that it was tasting corn and my mouth has no reason to lie to me. PAULA did not agree with this analysis, so your results may vary. It was only a couple of hours ago that I ate this pizza, but I am struggling to tell you anything about the sauce or the cheese. They were both perfectly adequate but did not excite me. The soppressata was the only non-crust highlight. And honestly, while the crust was remarkable, it wasn't my favorite either.

Bottom Line: I enjoyed the pizza at SLICE. It did not change my perception of pizza as a whole or convince me that I need to return for more. I am willing to accept that ordering a specialty like the Fancy Pants may have been a wiser move, but I like to order pretty similarly across each pizza place for the purpose of comparison unless there is a specific style or topping that a shop is known for. Like 'you may as well not even go to X place if you don't get their sicilian'. From reading reviews, I did not get the impression that I needed to go that route at SLICE, but my lack of enthusiasm for their soppressata pizza may prove that their specialties are the way to go, at least for me."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this pizza at all.. barely any cheese and little taste. Also got a steak hoagie, for the price it was small and tasteless as well. Both the pizza and hoagie bun were extremely hard to chew. Might as well chew on cardboard."}
{"text":"Slice on Broadway is my Favorite pizza in the area! I love their sauce and crust. Delivery is pretty quick and it always arrives hot and fresh. I have only ever had delivery except for the location inside PNC Park. I absolutely love their pepperoni rolls! They are semi garlicky and delicious. Slice offers a lot of specialty pizzas. I love the Hawaiian but with no onion. You can order delivery right here on the yelp app! I would recommend slice on Broadway to anyone looking for some good pizza!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today to get a pie.. love the pizza.  I am never disappointed. When I arrived at the check out to pay for my pizza..my eyes couldn't help but to check out everything that was behind the display case..so many delicious variations of pizza.. I decided on the meatball and banana pepper roll.  It looked good!  So I purchased that.   I brought back to the office and couldn't wait to try it ..  theres very little meatball or banana pepper.. it was all dough? (see picture)   
I certainly don't expect it to be oozing out of the roll but should be at least enough to see or taste it? Well the dough was good -  seasoned with a lot of garlic and ranch was provided.   I am just gonna stick with the pizza from now on."}
{"text":"We went to Slice on Broadway with the kids around 9pm on Saturday night. It's a part of PNC Park and the Pirates were in away in Detroit (kicking butt I might add) so the place was pretty quiet. Food was great, pies are big, and slices ample on their own. They have take-out beer too (Headhunter!) 
Bathrooms were clean and sterile when we were there, but very creepy at night. Kids refused to go by themselves. You exit the back of the restaurant and the vestibule (where the bathrooms are located) is outside, not well-lit, and has a wrought iron gate closing off the park. Inside, the bathrooms are huge, all concrete, and, on this night, the lights inside were flickering a bit. It happened to be a full moon, so the kids were causing mass hysteria over these bathrooms. I personally thought they were fine."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. One of the best I've tasted and it feels like home. The guy's at work here rock ! Always keep me coming back for more. The price is great too. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"The standard pizza is fairly thin with a nice big crust. I often go here for lunch and get the big pepperoni or cheese slices which they reheat in the oven right in front of you. Pizza runs around $3/slice roughly and there's also hoagie options. For lunch I get a Coke but they also have beer if you're stopping by for a Pirates game etc. The location has indoor (with a small bar seating area) and outdoor tables but also connects to PNC Park. The staff has always been pleasant and is quick to take orders. I also noticed they are on the \"uber eats\" app for delivery. They do not have any French fries or homemade chips etc. which is my only gripe because I like having fried side options, especially with a hoagie."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, knowing ahead of time that it had good reviews. We were pleased that huge slices were available along with rolls. We both got pepperoni slices and agreed the crust was very good. Nice thin but doughy body and a handle that was crisp on the outside but soft inside. The cheese was high quality and the right amount. The red sauce was on the thinner side but flavorful and definitely noticed on the slice. We tried a meatball and pepperoni roll, each served with a side of sauce. Both were tasty snacks. Will definitely be back here or to Beechview."}
{"text":"Not sure if the other reviewers are shills for competitors in the East End, but if they are, I wouldn't be surprised. If I owned a pizza place and Slice moved in near to me I'd be terrified. Fortunately, I'm just a huge fan of Slice from Morningside, so I am thrilled they have opened nearby.

Pizza at Slice is clearly made with incredibly high quality ingredients. These ingredients come together to make a thin crust NY style pie that rivals many of the pizzas I used to get back home in the New York area. 

Unlike the doughy and bland pizzas that you'll find at most Pittsburgh pizzerias, Slice has a flavorful sauce, that perfect level of grease, thin crust, and their pizza is baked to perfection. I would gladly put Slice up against any pizza in this city!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I own a paintball field locally and we use them regularly!"}
{"text":"Great brick oven-like pizza! Tasty, thin crust with super fresh toppings! Locally owned."}
{"text":"Spectacular! The folks that took care of us (we ate upstairs) were more concerned about our business than most high end restaurants we've been to. Then the pizza was delicious as well. Great Job!"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting pizza. Many different varieties. I come here often for lunch during the work day. Friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"Wonderful night out, friendly incredible staff, Great slices and appitisers excellent wine mead and Beer selection...."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time from the Carnegie shop and its the last time, the pizza tasted like cardboard with tasteless sauce, I know what good pizza tastes like and this is not it. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else !!! P.S the other reviews must be from the owner or his workers !"}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for a NY style thin crust pizza and Slice definitely does it right. It is the one pizza place in Pittsburgh my husband and I both agree on and we've certainly tried them all - Fiori's, Campiti's, Mineo's, Beto's, but I think hands down, Slice has them all beat. But, again, I'm partial to a thin crust which is why I love it. Before they opened their Carnegie location, we frequently drove to their original location on Broadway. 

If we stop during the week and I need a healthier option, their salads are also great. I know what you're thinking, why would you come here for the salad? But, I just love their house-made balsamic dressing and their spinach salad. And if I'm really still craving the pizza, they have perfect little pepperoni rolls that are delicious, as well. 

They have a lot of variety for a pizza shop and use all fresh ingredients. There are alos specialty pizzas and sandwiches and they deliver in the Carnegie area. And, now I'm craving Slice after writing this review... :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been searching for a pizza restaurant that makes both of us happy and Slice was just that. Through trial and error in the South Hills (Beto's, Bado's, A Pizza B'Adamo, Little Nippers, Fiori's), Slice was recommended to my husband. We went during the week and were pleasantly surprised. 

When in Carnegie, it is easy to drive by as it is a small location. You order and pay at the counter. There are about 5-6 tables in the restaurant. It is also BYOB, however they only provide plastic cups, which didn't bother us at all. 

Since it was our first visit, we ordered and eight cut pizza. You can order \"jumbo slices\"  and various rolls (pepperoni, spinach, meatballs, etc) at the counter. The wait was a little long but the staff was incredibly helpful when ordering and pleasant to all customers. 

The pizza was beautifully tossed: thin all around except the robust crust. The sauce was not too sweet and balance with a perfect amount of cheese. We will absolutely be back. This is our new favorite pizza place!

As we were leaving, the place was filling up!!!"}
{"text":"Great hoagies and salads! Definitely try the Luca or the spicy Italian hoagie. The employees are great and super helpful. If you want to give their pizza a try, id suggest trying the fancy pants or the buffalo chicken, but their slices of plain and pepperoni are good too. I'd give this slice on broadway 5 stars"}
{"text":"Slice has the best Margherita pizza, and the staff is always super friendly. This is our favorite pizza spot in town!"}
{"text":"The newest pizza spot in East Liberty is a hit!! Although not new to Pittsburgh, it is new to the area and it is a great addition. Slice offers a menu of unique pizzas and hoagies that are delicious! The pizza comes with an extremely crisp crust and packed with flavor. I also tried the spicy Italian hoagie and it didn't disappoint! Service was quick and kind, there's a lot of seating, the interior is clean and sharp, and it's BYOB!! What more could you need?!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite pizza places in the burgh. It isn't an overwhelming amount of cheese like Fioris or Mineos (which I love both). If you're looking for a thin, tasty pizza that won't put a ball of cheese in your tummy, this is the place. Good toppings, and pretty cheap. The one in dormont is super small though, so don't expect to come there with a party and all be seated. More of a take-out spot. Their pepperoni is awesome."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch several times.  Always fast and friendly service.  Pizza is pretty good, not the best I've ever had but a solid choice for a few slices before a game or quick lunch.  They give it to you piping hot so let it cool before you shove it down your pie hole."}
{"text":"Wow. First of all, when I walked in, I immediately saw all of these amazing pizzas. I had a hard time deciding which to order because they are massive slices (as big as my head), so realistically I could only eat one. I chose well because the 5 cheese pizza was one of the best pieces of pizzas I've ever eaten. I'd compare it to pizza I've had at fancy Italian restaurants, except it was way cheaper. It was that good. The slices are huge and packed with delicious toppings, in my case-5 cheeses. The crust is thin and crispy. They have several locations, and one that will deliver to my office in Green Tree. I will most definitely be back to try the buffalo chicken and barbecue chicken pizzas. They looked so good!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago and have been ordering pizza like it's my job. Yinz like your pizzerias!

SLICE has been my favorite by far! I ordered a Margherita pizza and it was fantastic. I could tell the ingredients were fresh and high-quality. The crust was the best part! So perfectly crispy and with great flavor."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh! The slices are HUGE and the price is right. I order Slice at least once a week and have never been disappointed - delivery, pick up, eat in....you name it.

MUST TRY: buffalo chicken pie"}
{"text":"I order pizza once every few years. This reminded me why.  I won't be ordering from Slice again, don't believe the hype, worse than your average neighborhood Vocelli-type place. If you do make the mistake of ordering from here, please drive there and pick it up, don't rely on delivery.  It will arrive hardened to within an inch of its life!  Calling to ask why delivery arrived 1/2 hour after they said it would be there will get you an \"I'm sorry\" but nothing else... Really pretty awful.. Disappointed and in a salt coma after less than a 1/4 of a sub, and 1 slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice!!!! Need I say more? haha

This place has outstanding pizza, great service and very good location. Went for two slices, and ended up coming back for one more. Check them out if you're in Carnegie."}
{"text":"I ordered two large pizzas from this location and spent $32.75. One was a standard red, and the other a specialty white. I was extremely disappointed with the product.

The sauce on the red was tasteless and generic, no spice was added to enhance any flavor from what seems like a typical canned sauce. The pizza dough was chewy and borderline undercooked. The white was incredibly dry. The little cheese that was on the pizza didn't even come close to the edge and all of the toppings were pushed towards the center as well. There had to have been at least an inch of crust that was bare. Toppings were clumpy. 

I struggle to find a decent pizza in Pittsburgh, especially here in the East End. The search will continue as I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I work at a diner but my Co workers and I wanted pizza,  first we thought we would just have pizza Hut deliver, but I suggested how about I pick us up slice on Broadway,  and everyone said yes!!! And wow were we glad we did!!!! Everyone loved the pizza, the person that made the pizza was steven very polite and nice. The chef at the diner is from new York and not from the area,  he said that is one of the best pizzas he's had since he's been in Pittsburgh,  said it taste like new York pizza,  I'm so glad we ordered there, even though it was just extra cheese and pepperoni and half supremo, still delicious,  I took menus we'll be trying other items for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am struggling with exactly what to say about this place because I see so many rave reviews on how fabulous their pizza is. I just brought home an 8 cut with a couple toppings and an antipasto salad. The pizza was of decent quality sauce and toppings wise but the amount of topping is scant to say the least and the crust requires some healthy chompers to chew. I mean it is brutal. To boil this down I guess, for me, it is a matter of value. This 8 cut could have been folded in half and eaten like a taco. Very small pizza for a price of over $13.00. The salad was fine. Fresh and crisp with a nice selection of meats and so forth. Again, not very big for a price of over $9.00. I guess what I am saying is if you plan on feeding a number of people you had better order a lot of stuff and be prepared to drop some cash. I guess to bottom line this I would say the food is average, at best, and the value/price ratio is poor. Won't be going back only because I can get better for less and more of it. By the way, as a matter of safety, be careful after dark at this location. Carnegie is not a great area to begin with and this shop is located in one of the less attractive parts of the borough."}
{"text":"I am stingy with 5 star reviews but this pizza earned it. Im from an area that is highly critical of pizza. Perfectly done crust. Great selection of toppings. Allowed you to do half and half specialty pies. We did margarita pizza and whatever the meat selection was (the guys wanted that). The have a nice selection of rolls with different things in them. Hot peppers, cheese steak, pepperoni. With side of ranch and tomato sauces for dipping. Very good. The music on in the restaurant reminded me of the 80's it was a nice throwback for me. Come here for pizza and you will not regret."}
{"text":"Great pizza & hoagies, try something new every time i'm here, staff always freindly & helpful, always working hard"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this location, and the pizza was good, but I had much higher expectations for the number of Top 10 lists Slice was listed on."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. I stopped at the beech view location a few years ago when it first opened for a couple cuts, and I've been hooked ever since. These guys put much passion into their pizza and it shows in the food quality. The crust is thin and chewy but with a perfect crisp on the bottom. The sauce is exactly how it should be, loaded with fresh basil and fresh tomato flavor. Of course the cheese is the real deal. This is my favorite pizza in town, even better than Fiori's . TRY THE NEW THICK CRUST PIZZA! It's effing unreal. The best pizza ever!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give these guys 10 stars but it wasn't an option.  Hands dahn the best pizza in the burgh, heck I'd even say the state.  Way better than fioris  (which is good also), Mineos, and I'll put Betos here even tho I don't think they should even be in the same breath as these 3 heavy weights of Pizza but many people seem to like their pizza."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to grab a bite by PNC Park. Conveniently located at PNC park but with an outside entrance. We were here for a ballpark tour, really hungry and running late- Slice on Broadway just hit the spot! Very friendly service and VERY good pizza. We loved the crispy crust, no slappy pizza here! and the Supremo just had the perfect amount of toppings. We all loved our slices, hangry status was averted and we made it to our tour on time. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Service was great. I ordered an Italian hoagie with the works and it was delicious and dressed perfectly. They use quality meats and that makes such a difference. My dining partners all purchased pizza by the slice and garlic knots and everyone was very happy. I look forward to trying more items on the menu. 

This location appeared to have bottled drinks only. 

There is street parking and a metered lot very close by."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed after reading the rave reviews. Pizza (plain/cheese) was slightly above average. A little dry. I was expecting a challenge to Aiello's in Squirrel Hill, but to no avail. Garden salad was pretty good. But in the end I can't see myself returning any time real soon. 

Best of all though were the employees. Super nice!  Give it a try at least once, maybe I'm wrong."}
{"text":"I'll give SLICE a nod, it definitely crosses a unique bridge between traditional South Hills style pizza and artisan pies.  After wanting to try it for a few years now, we finally made a random impulse stop on our way home on the the T.

Having remembered positive praise about the \"Fancy Pants\" pizza, we decided to give one of those a whirl.  As others commented, super thin, crisp and chewy crust (note, don't reheat these pies in the oven or you'll be greeted with a brick), but definitely no where close to my favorite dough.

The toppings seem to be where SLICE shines.  Inventive mix-ups, quality ingredients and portion control (yes...  I said it, not every pie needs to have 10 lbs of cheese and sauce on it) create an overall enjoyable bite.

I don't know what it was, but our party just wasn't digging it.  Even as I look back, I can't tell if I liked the pizza or if I was just hungry.  Given SLICE delivers, well likely give that a try next time we're in a bind for food, but I definitely don't think I'd actively seek it out with so many other great pie joints in the South."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time this past weekend, and being a pizza and specifically (Fiori's) lover.. Not talking smack.. But Slice is seriously good.. Like really good. I like the toppings selection better and I think it might be my new go-to!!!!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place from the day they opened but just recently they drastically raised their prices which is problem number one. problem number two is I ordered a pizza and was not told of the price increase and they had not sent out flyers reflecting the price increase so I thought I was paying a lower price.
 I talked to two managers who would not let me talk to the owner who would also not call me back and who refuses to even give me a small credit for my confusion and for the benefit of the doubt.
 I was rudely hung up on and told that nobody there really cared what I thought.
The pizza there is better than average but it is definitely not on the level of Mineo's or Fiori's and places like that.
I'm extremely disappointed needless to say I will not ever patronize this place again."}
{"text":"Loved the pesto sauce Green Monster pizza. Also like the pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. Great service."}
{"text":"Good pizza but a little on the pricey side. Cool atmosphere though especially if you are heading to an all game."}
{"text":"They don't deliver to the DoubleTree hotel. The shop was easy to find and clean. The pizza and sandwiches were amazing!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. It's a shame that other places can't seem to get it right.

I have only ever gotten slices from here. I am sure a whole pie would be good too.

The crust was crisp without the whole dough being over cooked. The sauce had a sweetness to it. The cheese was solid. 

Simple ingredients but put together and cooked the right way can make all the difference. 

The parking around the place can be busy so off hours may be better times to go."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to eat really quickly, and Slice on Broadway does the trick. You can look at the pizzas before you make your decision, then they will bring it over to you when it's hot. 

I love the outdoor seating, it's a wonderful location. 

The pizza is okay, just not my favorite. 

The staff were helpful and quick."}
{"text":"Slice on Broadway is a teeny tiny, heavenly smelling spot on Broadway Avenue in Beechview.  Since I had recently just returned from traveling, I decided that takeout would be easier and more convenient than sitting down inside to eat.  I phoned in my order while stuck in traffic, and the young man who took my order was very understanding when I inquired how long it would take to prepare my order.  He said 25 minutes tops, which was perfect; I placed an order for a large (12 slices) Slaughterhouse Five pie and a Florentine hoagie.  I arrived in about 15 minutes, after navigating through a neighborhood I never even knew existed, and nabbed a prime parking spot right in front of the restaurant. 

Slice on Broadway is situated on a street that has a few small mom and pop businesses, houses, and a live track for the T (watch out!).  They were finishing up my order when I walked in, but I was happy to wait a few extra minutes if it meant I was going to walk out of there with a piping hot pizza.  My total came to $25 for the two items... the pizza itself was extremely reasonably priced ($16) given the quality of ingredients and overall size.  The Slaughterhouse Five is topped with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, capicola and prosciutto -- I basically died and went to Italian heaven.  I can't quite explain to you how hard it was to drive the extra 15 minutes home with that pizza in my car.  It took everything I had in me to not grab a piece right out of the box at a red light!

The Florentine hoagie ($8), was good albeit a tad disappointing.  I thought I was guaranteed a home run by selecting this proscuitto, mozzarella, spinach and pesto mayo combination, but when I got home and we opened the bag... wah wah wahhhhh.  The sandwich was a rather petite 10\" baguette and the fillings were skimpy.  My boyfriend said he loved it, but I thought it left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps it could've used some more proscuitto and spinach... whatever it was, it definitely could've been a little more substantial for the price.  On the positive side, they do use fresh Breadworks baguettes, which are a nice and tasty touch.

If you need any evidence that I will go back to this place again and again, I can tell you that two days later, we had a conversation about what we should get to eat, and Slice on Broadway came up. Twice.  Whenever we do decide to go back, I know the Slaughterhouse Five will be on the agenda, and possibly another more generic pizza as well, so that I can really experience all this place has to offer.  You know, just in case that first delicious, perfect pizza didn't completely convince me."}
{"text":"Good pizza, most always clean, it can be crazy during lunchtime so I would advise calling ahead."}
{"text":"Rico makes the best pizza in town. I used to work for him as well, great boss and never cuts corners when it comes to quality. When I crave pizza I order from Slice :)"}
{"text":"A great value for lunch.  Meatball and bellpepper roll for the win."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, but the sandwiches are even better.  The high quality ingredients they use really make the difference.  These guys really know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that this place has fallen in my esteem from best pizza to eh pizza.  We got the regular pie with half meatballs and half pineapple.  There were several pieces that had neither topping on it at all!  The pineapple was canned and the meatballs were tiny pieces of ground beef with minimal seasoning.  There was hardly any cheese at all.  I will say that the crust is still well done and the sauce is still good, but this place has been going downhill for a few years now and I sadly think this will be the last time we order.  Sad days in a pizza lover's heart."}
{"text":"A friend and I showed up around 7 on a Thursday evening and within 10 minutes we received a piping hot pie. We sat at a table on the sidewalk in front of the shop and watched the T roll by. Occasionally the owner/pizza maker/ waiter/ cashier/ dish washer popped out from behind the counter to chat and see if we needed anything. 

The crust is what makes this pizza fantastic. It's super thin, crispy and coated in a light dusting of cornmeal. For how thin the crust is it is surprisingly sturdy which in my opinion is a MUST. No one wants to try and dangle a scalding hot slice into their mouth as all of the toppings slide down you chin. The sauce is slightly sweet but tasted mostly like fresh summer tomatoes. Top that off  with fresh mozzarella and fresh picked basil and you have a pizza that can't be beat. A large pizza and two Cokes was $15. 

If you're in the South Hills stop by SLICE, the owner and the pizza is great. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This pizza place is located in the Pittsburgh Pirates Stadium. In the back was a door that you could enter the stadium with.

It's clean and modern with seating outside. You can buy pizza by the slice or the whole pie. They have other Italian food as well.

My pepperoni pizza was ok, I've had better. The best thing about this place is its location."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good pizza.  The crust was good, the toppings seemed fresh, the sauce was good."}
{"text":"My first time at this location and it was great! 

Service: The staff went above and beyond what a normal pizza shop usually does. They made sure to attend to every need and we're happy.

Food: The vegetarian pizza was amazing, the veggies all mashed to create a yummy salad like topping on the pizza. The veggies were a plenty, but not overloaded. I really want to try the green monster pizza next time I come.

Price: the price was average to low, definitely worth the value of the pizza and drinks.

Overall: This place is great with a selection of sodas, beer, and pizza. Eat upstairs for a classic feel."}
{"text":"We used to love Slice. The pizza was thin and crispy. The past few times, it's been very chewy. It's like crust that's been reheated in a microwave. Not sure what changed. But hope it changes back! Miss that crispy crust!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've ever had. When I lived in Beechview I ordered from them constantly. Now that I've moved I'm sad that I can't order from them anymore. Their pizza has won numerous awards, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Scary that this place is rated as high as it is on here- don't be mislead, this pizza is AWFUL."}
{"text":"Had pizza and beer while seated outside.  No baseball game that evening.  Food was good and sitting outside was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Slice On Broadway. Their pizza is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy and the right balance of cheese and sauce and their slices are huge. 
A plus is they deliver to Mt. Washington (even though their website says they don't). 
Slice On Broadway is a must try!"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup on a Saturday. Small pepperoni, small thick crust spicy sausage, and cheesy bread sticks. The food came out of the oven when I picked it up. Flavor of the crust was doughy (in a good way). The sauce wasn't to sweet as some places are. The sausage could have been more spicy but the taste was good. Would order a larger size of the regular pizza as its thin and not super filling. Somewhat expensive at $32 for all 3 items. Don't like that they charge more for thick crust. The staff wasn't overly friendly and seemed a bit shady. But, overall the pizza was flavorsome and will order again."}
{"text":"This was pretty bad pizza. I decided to try it because a lot of reviews said it was like New York pizza... But the sauce tasted like ketchup and the cheese did not taste like real mozzarella. The crust had cornmeal on the bottom, which gave it a little bit of a crunch but a bad taste.  Garlic knots were OK. If you are a student looking for a pie I suppose this place is fine..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place. I haven't ordered for awhile and I did tonight.   The food took 1 hour and 50 min.   The expectation was about an hour, hour and 15 min.  We got the Italian hoagies and pizza.    Everything was cold.  The lettuce soggy.   Not worth the price.   Should have stuck with my usual."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Hoagies.... best in the city. Also very friendly staff. The sauces are awesome and hoagies are huge. If you are in the beechview area, you need to order here. it's a must. Grab a SLICE."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a quick meal.

Ordered 2 slices of pepperoni - Bill $5.35.

Waited 8 mins.

Pizza passed the stand test.   Please note that the slice was about 12 inches long and about 5 inches wide at the crust.

Taste - Awesome!

Best NY Style Pizza in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but they didn't have as crispy and crust as promised. This could be because the veggies sogged it down (and there were a great load of veggies!) but still just wasn't outstanding. Expect 45+mins for delivery."}
{"text":"Slice is the best pizza Pittsburgh has to offer.  Thin NY style crust and excellent sauce.  The Capricosa is one of the most delicious pies I have ever had and we order it every time.  Hoagies are great also.  Service is always super friendly.  Try it if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"We ordered some pizza for a quick dinner after arriving back into town.  They deliver, which was a huge and welcome surprise!  No charge for delivery!  We tried the green monster that I had read about.  The large pizza is definitely large!  There wasn't much pesto, but I really enjoyed the pizza!  The artichokes were yummy and plenty of peppers and feta!  It was a winner.  My fiance got a pepperoni pizza and said it was good.  Not the best ever, but he enjoyed it.  The pizza crust was my favorite part!  Nice crisp and chewy!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype: Slice is really, really good. It's the real deal.

Being married to a former New Yorker who treats a good pizza shop like a temple, I can say that this shop is as close to a New York pizzeria as we get in the 'Burgh. Slices on display in a case at the register, cooler full of pop (including really yummy root beer) on the wall when you walk in, pies of a million different varieties to order for take-out or dine-in.

The crust is nice and thin. The slices are huge. There's just the right amount of grease and crispiness to the pizza, and a healthy dose of cheese and toppings. It's basically what a perfect by-the-slice slice looks like. (They also have a hearty stock of pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese, and some little jar at the front labeled 'magic garlic stuff' that is really pretty magical.)

Also, since the downstairs seating is itty bitty, there is a second floor seating area as well. Just place your order at the counter and they'll bring it up.

The staff is super nice (which, okay, maybe disqualifies it as a *real* New York pizzeria), and they're patient with you if you take ten years trying to pick what slice you want (sorry about that, too many choices!).

Yes, it's a bit out of the way for us cityfolk (the South Hills? But don't we have to cross a RIVER and use a TUNNEL to get there??), but it's absolutely worth going out for. It's right off the T line, and we had no trouble finding street parking on a Saturday night, even though the shop was packed.

We may not make the trip to the South Hills very often, but I have a feeling that any journey we make out that way will include a route that passes by Slice."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you are a fan of very thin slices.  The ingredients are definitely fresh which makes for a great flavor.  Also, the pizza is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp.  They also have a great house made ranch which goes well with the pizza.

I also had the breadsticks and a buffalo chicken roll.  Neither of these were very good, so I will stick to just the pizza when I come back.

On top of the good food, the service here was great for a pizza shop.  Every worker was extremely friendly with the customers including myself.  They check to make sure your order is right and also made sure to hold the exit door as people walked out with their food."}
{"text":"Can't believe we waited so long to try their pizza! Quick delivery, friendly staff, and really great pizza! we ordered an XL traditional pizza - half pepperoni and (fresh) mushrooms, half sausage and onion.  The thin crust:sauce ratio was just right, sausage is a little spicy, but delicious. Overall, some of the best pizza we've had in Pittsburgh!
This is our new pizza place!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is arguably the best in the city.   Funny thing is, I would have passed this place right by had a friend who lives locally not recommended it.  Oh, and did I mention the Italian hoagie? One word BOMB!   You will not be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Extremely over salted pizza and horrible customer service! At first I liked that joint, but today I was completely frustrated how they deal with theirs mistakes and how they treat customers, I have been in bed not able to eat or walk for 5 days and I was starving so I ordered pizza from them with extra garlic to bust my immune system however they did not tell me it's not a garlic it's basically salt and garlic in end pizza was awfully salty and really bed for my kidneys pain which I suffer from, they even did not apologize or offered another pizza, so I left hungry. Why???? U guys treat ur regular customers?????"}
{"text":"Ordered online and I went there on time but they told me to wait another 30 min because it is not them who set the time. Doesn't seem like clean enough because everyone does not wear a mask or hat while cooking and also talks while cooking. I won't use this restaurant again. When I asked if my pizza was being cooked, the owner said yes but it was a lie. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Greasy, yet extremely delicious. Good sauce, cheese, and crust all stood out. Slices alone are good sizes and the 12 inch can be shared by two perfectly."}
{"text":"Was told that this is like NY pizza but I'm not too convinced. Slices are huge and a little floppy. Pizza tasted better the second day, but this isn't my favorite slice in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love Slice specialty pies and they deliver!  Great pizza and they have great salads, even the side salad is excellent (think it's the homemade croutons and dressing).
Only once did I ever have any issue, just kid working with bit of attitude.   Who knows maybe it was closing time?"}
{"text":"Customer service is rude and short on the phone. Also they do not stay open past 10 on Friday nights after pirates games, so clearly not run by very hard working or smart individuals. 

Never had the pizza."}
{"text":"As the other reviewers have said, I was initially very excited about having a new pizza place opening in East Liberty. But I was quickly disappointed.
First of all, the prices are very high - I spent $9 on two slices of pizza. Apparently, they charged extra for toppings (including pepperoni), but nobody thought it was necessary to let me know while I was ordering.
I would have been okay with such a high price if at least the taste could justify it, but it just added to my disappointment. My slices were slightly burnt, the crust was dry and too thin, and the cheese didn't taste like mozzarella at all.
Look, I'm all about some crappy, late night pizza, but it has to be cheap. Since I didn't find this in Slice on Broadway, I'll continue getting my late night pizza at Pizza Perfectta."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had.   And if the owner blames it on the people working that night it's still his fault for hiring them.   For as thin as it is how could it ever be under cooked."}
{"text":"We love SLICE. We usually do pepperoni and mushroom. Nothing fancy. Always good. We ordered online and the pick up time was spot on. Big thumbs up to the antipasta salad too. Generous helpings of good stuff. House made dressing was solid."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pizza spots. PNC park location is awesome for lunch. Really glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, under staffed. Ordered 2 salads took 1 hour and 45 minutes and were wrong. Manager blamed new staff. Steak Salad was dry and mostly large leafs of romaine. Steak was dried out cardboard like pieces. \"House balsamic\" was gross sludge. Their pizza is fine, but better pick-up if you want before bedtime."}
{"text":"I have had the pizza here and its pretty good. First good thing to mention is that you get 20% off your order when you have your first check in! I work within walking distance from the federal location at PNC Park so its really convenient to get to during lunch time. They are also fast with their preparation. This particular visit i had the Steak Caballero. its was sliced steak with mozzarella cheese and provolone, jalapeno's, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and a spicy ranch. Different from a regular cheese steak hoagie that I would have normally ordered. it was good. A nice kick to it but not too spicy."}
{"text":"closest to the river of the PNC Park offerings, Slice on Broadway is a sure bet! Fresh hand tossed pizza and related delicacies - garlic knots, bruschetta, focaccia and the like - with fresh pesto, tomato, or white sauce! Tasty ranch too! Wide selection of beers wines and liquors, Coca Cola products and lemonade! Definitely order up a pie for pickup or drop in for a drink, sure to please your palate!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good. It's not really authentic New York pizza but it's a solid choice if you're looking for something outside of the usual mineos or fioris pie."}
{"text":"Darren ordered some of their pizza for us on moving day and it was excellent!!!! Keep in mind I don't usually order pizza, but this was good."}
{"text":"Since moving to Pittsburgh about 6 months ago, I have been searching for a pizza place I like. Slice on Broadway has ended my search! The most critical part of pizza is the crust and Slice rocks the homemade, hand tossed perfect (in my opinion). Not too thick, not too thin, just perfect. Next comes a good variety of delicious fresh ingredients. Slice excels in providing high quality cured meats, cheeses, vegetables, and pizza standbys like roasted red peppers and kalamata olives. Both the pesto sauce and the red sauce are full of flavor. I haven't tried the white sauce yet. Slice has three locations, but I'll be excited to frequently visit the one at PNC Park whenever I attend a Pirates game or just need a good pizza fix!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, definitely a top 3 option when you're looking for a quick lunch in Carnegie.  I ordered a slice of white pizza and a meatball/banana pepper roll for lunch. It was ready a few minutes after ordering which is always a plus. 

The white pizza had spinach and tomatoes,  very thin crust (I'm usually not a fan but it worked well here) and the meatball /banana pepper roll was excellent. 

Very clean looking restaurant and the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Delicious slices of pizza! 

I thought $4 was slightly pricey for a slice (to get full you'd need 2), but the flavor was awesome. The crust was slightly crispy and the sauce was simple. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Not a super huge fan of thin crust but I find Slice to be pretty tasty anyway. My favorite is just plain pepperoni or a delicious Hawaiian (add bacon, duh). We've ordered from here a few times even though we don't live in Beechview (the in laws do and order from Slice all of the time). Agreed on another review that they should add more of that delicious sauce; sharing is caring after all. Also slightly disappointing that the pineapple on the Hawaiian isn't fresh. Still, we'll definitely continue to order an occasional Slice."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I didn't find this place as soon as we got to town because I am afraid that I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else. The day we found it we went for lunch and then back for dinner. The pizza and pepperoni rolls were both fresh and hot. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were there on a Sunday during a Steelers game, but the service was still plenty fast. If you are looking for a great meal with fresh, homemade ingredients then this is your place."}
{"text":"We came here for an event and the food was great. I have pretty high expectations of pizza and it met those expectations. The pizza had a good crust with toppings that worked well together. The garlic knots and other Italian appetizers were also all on point.

The event itself was a lot of fun and we got to go back and make some pizza. 

I am looking forward to going back during regular business hours to be able to comment on the regular service."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best pizzas and hoagies in town.one of my favorite pizza spots. Employees are extremely helpful"}
{"text":"i love this place. closed thing to new york pizza outside NY/NJ.  Prime location in PNC park."}
{"text":"Nice little pizzeria. Big thin NY Style slices. Love that they have Sriracha on the tables. I'll stop back for a Slice for sure. I was in and out and spent less than $3. Not sure I would order for delivery but it's ok if you just need a quick bite."}
{"text":"The other night while a bit inebriated, my friends starting talking about ordering a pizza and I started looking forward to eating a delicious slice of NY style plain cheese.

The opted to go for Sicilian crust. I was crushed and started fantasizing about NY style and this desire was still there when I woke up!

So a couple days later, I search Yelp for the best NY style pizza near me.

Now, I have my go to pizza places for \"in-between\" crusts, but not for thin.

(My totally personal understanding of pizza crusts is as follows:)
NY style: difficult to hold with one hand. Super thin, cheesy, greasy, yum
Inbetween: A fair amount of crust but not overpowering. Capable of holding multiple toppings
Deep Dish: Self explanatory and generally not my bag

Now, to satisfy my NY style craving, sources pointed to Fiori's, which I love and grew up on, but wasn't in the mood for, and Slice. I opted to give Slice a go!

They don't deliver out my way (bummer,) so I drove 10 minutes or so to pick it up. The inside of the restaurant is small, 3-4 tables and then the counter. The other patrons were friendly and talkative and made me wish that Slice had been open when I lived in Beechview as I'm sure I would have been a regular. Service was also very friendly and fast.

Did the pizza live up to my 2-day long daydream? Not quite, but it was still very good. I'm still on the hunt for my favorite thin crust but this was a pretty good contender. But what's really going to keep my coming back to slice are the hoagies! I'm not typically a huge fan, but the description of the Italian sold me and I was not disappointed. From the varierty of meats and cheeses to the baguette style bun it was served on, it was delicious. Will happily order again."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely excellent pizza place. Last night I learned that during Pirates games you can actually enter the stadium via the restaurant. And the dining area technically becomes part of the stadium. 

This new pizza place here has nothing to do with the old corporate one that was here previously. Slice opened here in April of 2016 and has expanded on their original two locations in the area. 

The owner is super friendly and totally passionate about his work, and you can tell. Because of his positive attitude the staff has a positive attitude and the food reflects that as well. 

The pizzas are NY style and absolutely excellent. I can't wait to come back for a slice in the summers or any other time I'm in the area. 

Pro tip: the little spinach rolls are amazing."}
{"text":"Good pizza nice spot when at the game or out on a boat.  Bunch of slices to choose from"}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza and there were dough bubbles which were burned and the bottom was burned pretty badly. I lost my appetite. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza at PNC Park comes from this Vincent's offshoot. Located on Federal Street and is open even when the Bucs are pit of town. You can buy a whole pie or just a slice or two. Thick slices, good amount of tasty cheeses, I usually get black olives and mushrooms. Sweet sauce, hints of garlic. Good pie! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why the place is packed at lunch time...the pizza is AWESOME!  Dropped by before a ball game and we really, really liked it.  Tried different slices - BBQ, pepperoni, buffalo chicken and plain - they were all great. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner with my wife and a friend of ours. The inside of this place has a decent setup with a bar (not the alcohol type) to sit at near the front window, then 4 or so tables behind that in the heart of the restaurant.  The coolest part is that it looks like this location used to be a bank as the vault area is still there and you can actually sit inside of it.  We thought about doing just that before ultimately deciding that the lack of windows and enclosed feeling wasn't really worth it.  The employees here were also really nice and pleasant to us the whole time that we were there.  I think that they had a good sense of humor too as when the three of us were leaving we were talking about heading to Fiori's, another local South Hills pizza joint, the next time we met up.  The last thing I heard right before the front door shut from two of the gentlemen working there was how we had just said the F word (Firori's of course) so I got a good laugh about that.

For our dinner we decided to go with one of the specials from their flyer and ordered two large one topping pizzas.  For the first pizza we decided to have the traditional red sauce with sliced chicken on it while for the second pizza we chose the green sauce (basil pesto sauce, made with fresh basil, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pecorino Romano cheese, and pine nuts) with pepperoni as our topping.  After ordering we proceeded to our seats for the little wait before our pizzas came out.  The pepperoni with green sauce came out first and it was followed shortly thereafter by the traditional pizza with chicken.  As with all pizzas these two can be broken down into their three main components: sauce, cheese and crust.  The crust is easily my favorite part of Slice's pizzas as it is thin and has a good crispiness to it.  The two sauces for the pizza were quite different from each other but I think that I liked the green sauce a little more than the red sauce.  The reason for this is that I think that the green sauce stood out a bit more to me with its basil flavor although they were both good and had some nice spices in them.  Last but not least was the cheese of which there was an ample amount and it had a good flavor to it.  The only thing about our visit that I wasn't a huge fan of ended up being the amount of oil that ended up on the last pieces of our green sauce pizza.  You see we started eating the pizza from one side as most people do.  As we ate more and more of it the pan started leaning towards the now much heavier side and so the large amount of oil from both the cheese and the pesto sauce ended up covering the bottom of our last few slices.  At least you could tell that they used a real olive oil in their pesto!

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here again in the future.  It has both a good location and setup and its employees always seem to be friendly.  Of course there is the pizza too which is quickly becoming one of my favorites in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I have stopped by here twice now, once with my father for lunch and most recently a couple of Tuesdays ago with my wife for dinner.  Both times we were enthusiasticly greeted by the person behind the counter immediately after walking through the door.  SLICE on Broadway is actually located inside of an old house.  The room that you first enter into is a smallish dining room with a window to order your food on the right and some coolers with beer, soda and water on your left.  What I really like about the place though is that you can walk up the stairs (watch your head if you are over 6 foot as I have hit it on each visit while walking up) to another dining room that has seating for 22 and a TV.

Both times that I have come here I have ordered the ginormous pizza (20\") with a topping, sausage on the first visit and pepperoni on the most recent.  The pizza is brought up the stairs by one of the workers and served to you.  As with all pizzas this pizza can judged on it's three major parts: the crust, the sauce and the cheese.  My favorite part of this specific pizza is the crust.  It's fairly thin which means the bottom gets a bit crispy which I loved and it also has some good taste.  The cheese and sauce are both harder for me to describe since I feel like the toppings covered the flavor.  However they were in good proportion to each other which led to the cheese not falling off and it not being dry.

The bottom line is that this is quickly becoming one of my favorite pizza spots and I will surely be back here again in the future.  Not only is the pizza superb but the people that work here are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Slice on Broadway is a mini chain of slice shops in and around Pittsburgh. This branch seems out of keeping with the sleek modern new food places around East Liberty but they do a pretty good slice of New York style pizza. This particular branch has friendly counter staff and while the restaurant isn't dirty it's a little beaten up and lacking in charm. I had a slice of mushroom pizza which was piping hot with a thin crisp base and tasty sauce. All in all it was a pretty good slice, on a par with what you find in NYC, but I would say that they skimped a little on the mushrooms. Prices are on the high side for Pittsburgh - comparable to what I would pay back home in NYC. It's more of a 3.5 Star place for me but I rounded it up because I did enjoy my 'zza."}
{"text":"Really great tasting pizza can be found here at this location. The prices seem a little on the higher side but I think that it's on par with the size of the food that you get."}
{"text":"Just okay, given how great I'd always heard it was. I had two slices and a soda at the Slice in East Liberty this week. It cost $9, and I gave the guy a dollar. It isn't bad pizza. It just isn't great pizza, especially at the price. The slices are large, at least. Next time, I'll probably just have one."}
{"text":"Came in on recommendation from the beer bar across the street even though I've been to PNC Park about 10 times never tried your place... Had a small pie with meatballs fresh goat cheese roasted red peppers and mozzarella and I will tell you it was killer !!
I am from the land of Pizza Southern New Jersey and I know my Pizza and this was damn good so good I ate the whole pie."}
{"text":"Chewy/crispy thin crust, good sauce, appropriate amount of cheese (unlike most Pittsburgh pizza). Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Slice on Broadway is one of my favorite pizza places around! Living in Dormont, there are so many delicious pizza option but so many places do not deliver. Slice is one of the few places that will bring a decent pie to my doorstep. I have tried so many different pies and they are all good. The Frisky Billy goat is one of my favorites with meatballs, goat cheese and roasted red peppers. I also really like their hoagies. Both the Gonzo and the Luca are really top notch. The only complaint, if you can even call it that, is that I wish they made their specials of the day known. Ocassionally I will see something on instagram but I think it would be helpful for the consumer to post them on their website. Although, really, I couldn't care less. It is good pizza and that is really what matters."}
{"text":"We ordered a large cheese pizza, which was DELICIOUS! I also ordered the little guy salad, which had a little too much spinach for me, but otherwise was a nice little salad. We ate in, but there were no plates. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I stopped in this little shop on my lunch break yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I kept it simple and ordered two slices of cheese, but it was the best local pizza i've had! The staff was super friendly and my food came out fast, fresh, and hot. I have already highly recommended this shop to my coworkers and plan to go back later this week to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Maybe the original location is better? Or maybe they need more time to find the groove? In the meantime, go to caliente or somewhere else. Pizza (fancy pants) was soggy and weirdly undercooked. Hoagie (Venetian) was just awful. Disappointing, but rooting for them!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent sauce and the crust was delicious 
Best thin pizza I have had in while 
Moderate prize but well worth for the taste"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I've never left a review online before pertaining to food. I'm pretty easy to please. That being said, it's pretty hard to mess up pizza. However, I want to take this time to congratulate Slice for accomplishing this daunting task. 

Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it took a little under an hour and a half to arrive and was cold and hard as a rock when I opened the box. Flavorless and difficult to chew. Almost inedible. I'm tempted to compare it to pizza flavored cardboard, but that would be an insult to pizza flavored cardboard. 

They were closed by the time I tried to call and discuss the \"pizza\" that they had delivered, so I can't comment on their customer service. 

...but the bottom line is that I could have made myself a better pizza using the stale hamburger buns, ketchup, and near expired shredded taco cheese in my kitchen. 

Save yourself $20 and the 20 minutes you'll spend trying to reheat/revive the \"pizza\" before throwing it away and giving up. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"The pizza is always a hit here, never has been a miss. Their pizza dough is thin. The red sauce is smooth (bear with me as I try to describe it), but it's like they pur√©ed the tomatoes, allowing the sauce to stay thicker and chunkier. It is definitely homemade. The toppings are well distributed. The specialty pies are also very good. Next time I have one I will give details. 
   The bread sticks are thin, brushed with a garlic butter, with oregano and parm. You can order the sticks with cheese for extra. However, I fancy just the regular sticks.
   Slice on broadway offers a big menu of specialty pies, hoagies, and salads. They also offer a \"Ginormous\" pie that is 20\" 16 cuts. The prices are very reasonable and this place is one of my favs! Minimum free delivery of $10 orders, can pick up, or dine in."}
{"text":"As you can see the slices are huge. The crust is perfect. Cheese tastes good. And finally a place that heats your slice up hot but not so hot you have to wait 10 minutes to eat it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza I've had in a very long time! Tried a sandwich here the first time (about a year ago) and it was OK, but then had Pizzaa few days ago... Wow!  As good as I remember from a local Pizza place in Colorado from many years past. There are so many Pizza places around Pittsburgh to try, but Slice will be my fall back and, since I now live here in Carnegie, my home town favorite.
 Priced right too! Try it... you'll like it I'm sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a plain slice for lunch on this sunny day. The service was great and very friendly. The pizza slice was huge and the base is light and airy. The sauce and cheese was the right amount. They also have sriracha which I put on top of the crust. 

Very good pizza and good option for us working on the North Shore. They also have outside seating. Will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I've loved Slice since it opened and am really happy for all of their success. I think I've had every type of pizza. The supremo and big Lou might be my favorites but that's a hard decision. All are so good. Their breadsticks and salads are also quite tasty. Their customer service is great too. I wish I could order there weekly (which is what I used to do) but the healthy diet doesn't jive with that so now it's only a special, much-enjoyed, occasional treat."}
{"text":"Great pizza, slices are always ready and fresh ...plus service is always quick/friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious NY style pizza. Plain cheese or a one-topping mushroom pie hits the mark. Their supremo was a bit salty and the thin onions did not look appealing; looked like worms to be honest. Advice to them is to cut onions into diced cubes or bigger rings."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this pizza after reading all the rave reviews. But this was bad. We picked up their Veggie Pie specialty pizza. It was not well made. It was kinda raw. I told them no olives but they put it any way. There was hardly any sauce. The crust was very flimsy and again tasted raw and very very difficult to chew. Sorry but we will never get their pizza again."}

{"text":"Yum, yum and more yum!  Amazing pizza and they deliver :)  Nice thick & crispy crust, plentiful toppings & just the right amount of pizza sauce & cheese.  Kudos to Slice!!  We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Discovered Slice after we moved into our new house. I can't get enough. Everything about their pizza is heaven. The cheese, the crust, the sauces, & the ratio are all superb. They do a New York style pizza and they do it well. Also have tried their breadsticks and they are super yummy. I've gotten take out and delivery. Both ways have been. Great. Delivery has always been quicker than they said, except for one Sunday BUT it was a Sunday and the Steelers were playing so I don't hold that against them. The prices a slightly higher than some other pizza places, but I personally think that it's worth it for the quality of the pizza you get. Dang. Now I want Slice pizza immediately."}
{"text":"Um, not sure how this place got a 4.5 star rating. The staff is nice but the pizza I had was pretty average.

I had two of the pepperoni rolls. They were reheated (as all the pizza appears to be) and maybe lukewarm. The bread was good and seasoned well but there wasn't that much meat or cheese in the roll. My mom's salad looked decent. The garlic knots are good - they come in threes.

Maybe it scored some points for being attached to PNC Park and serving beer. I'd come back, it's good, but it's not a 4 or 5 star pizza place."}
{"text":"I have never had a disappointing pizza from Slice. I love their specialty pizza concoctions and rarely venture outside of the house pies. The Green Monster is a favorite, along with the Capricciosa (add banana peppers). The pesto sauce is SO GOOD. The crust is perfect, crispy with the perfect amount of chewiness. The hoagies are good too, though I usually go for the pizza. The four stars are due to the continually terrible time estimate - several times I've shown up at the estimated time and they are just adding toppings to the pizza and getting it ready for the oven. Once, I waited 30 minutes after arriving for my pizza. However, I will continue being a patron of Slice as the quality of pizza is so great."}
{"text":"Our family was attending Movie Night at PNC Park. It was a lot of fun and a great time for a family. We planned to meet at the Park early to eat dinner. We chose Slice. My husband and I had eaten at the Slice on Broadway in Beechview and liked it so we knew what to expect. There are a few tables inside the shop and several outside. It was a beautiful night so we sat outside. They have a pre-game special of a large pizza and two drinks for $25. We ordered that with two extra sodas. We got half cheese half black olive and sausage. It didn't take long for 4 adults to eat the pizza. The sauce has a great flavor and has a nice portion of cheese. The crust USA little chewy and a little crispy. It's a great bite of pizza. The nice thing is that you can buy pizza inside the ball park as well."}
{"text":"GO HERE!!!  I live in DC but drive to Pitt once a month to visit family. Slice on Broadway is DELICIOUS!!  I've had Mineos, A'pizza Badamo, Fiori's (my 2nd fav), Beto's, Aiello's, and Spak Bros.....Slice on Broadway is number one. Thin, crispy, sauce not to sweet...and tasty. IMO - to determine the best pizza place..try the plain no frills cheese pizza. If that holds up against others...that's your winner. Also, Slice just knows how to run a business - floors, tabletops, and bathrooms were spotless...uber clean and not something I expected from a pizza joint. The cleanliness is a bonus...the pizza itself earned 5 stars on it's own. Pic here is my personal fav - extra cheese."}
{"text":"I've been putting this off but,  I'm posting it because I'm angry and can't stop thinking about it.   Missing This!?!  I saved this and keep looking at it.  I got a Pizza a week ago from the Carnegie Location and pulled this out of my Mouth while eating Your Pizza.  Your lucky I didn't swallow it!!  The Pizza Sucked to.  I have no clue how this place is recognized best Pizza in the Burgh...  This is some of the worst Pizza I've ever had anywhere.  Frozen box Pizza is way better than this."}
{"text":"It's a miracle! We have FINALLY found a 100% great pizza place in Pittsburgh! This is it! 

We've tried soooo many places and have been disappointed so many times. Even more expensive places have failed us. Slice is actually affordable although considering how good it is, I would totally pay more to get pizza this good (glad it's affordable though for real).

They were SUPER accommodating about my slightly odd order, and even called back a minute later to double-check something to make sure it would be 100% to our preferences. I always really really appreciate when places do this.

I can't even explain in words how good this pizza is. The dough is incredible in so many ways (perfect crispness, perfectly chewy inside of the crust, FLAVORFUL unlike most pizzas around here..), FRESH mushrooms thank god, a great variety of toppings and great quality as well.. I get sauce-less pizza so I can't quite vouch for the sauce but I'm sure that's good too! They even have 3 sauces to choose from. Also it even reheats well! You know it's a good pizza if it tastes good hot, room temp, OR reheated *thumbs up*. Just literally the pizza I've been dreaming of finding for uh basically my whole life! 

THANK YOU, Slice!!"}
{"text":"If there is a more perfect pizza, I do not know what it would consist of: Slice on Broadway provides a pie with a delicious crust, cheese, and sauce, and the tables include containers of grated cheese, pepper flakes, and fresh oregano.  The staff is generally pleasant and accommodating and works well under pressure during busy times.  At $17 for a large plain pizza including tax, the product is not overpriced and offers value by ballpark standards.  The young gentleman who appears to be the manager is always welcoming and gracious to me and my companions.  I miss Slice on Broadway during the Pirates offseason and the restaurant makes my visits to the ballpark much more enjoyable: bravo!"}
{"text":"I dined at the location at PNC Park Friday night, 15 April 2016.  There is not enough seating.  One must arrive when the gates open to be assured of securing a table and the only tables have high chairs onto which one must climb: not for everyone.  Although it is thinner than I prefer, the pizza was good; it looks delicious and it is.  The sauce, crust, and cheese combine nicely, and are good quality. The only facet of the pizza that was poor was the \"steak\" topping; it resembled and tasted like \"Steakum\" frozen product. I object to the presence of a tip jar for counter service for a $24 pizza.  I should not have to provide a subsidy to an employer that does not wish to compensate its employees adequately."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! I've been going to The Slice now for almost two years I believe and it is considerably the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you like pizza with a thinner crust then you will thoroughly enjoy the pizza here. All of the toppings are tasty with my favorite being peperoni and sausage. Their hoagies are also very good here, though they are slightly on the smaller side of a typical hoagie. Lastly the staff at The Slice is always very friendly and great at doing their jobs. Consistently good food and great service!"}
{"text":"I used to love Slice's pizza, but it's definitely not anywhere near as good as it used to be. The last few times I've ordered, it's been over cooked and dry, and way too light on the sauce & cheese. I tried the pepperoni stuffed breadsticks last night and they're pretty awful- not actually breadsticks but pepperoni folded btwn tasteless pizza crust. The hoagies are small. Not sure I'll try again."}
{"text":"I really like Slice. The regular pizza is always great, definitely thin crust. This time I tried the Margherita for the first time, and it's my new fave. The sauce was tangy, with the perfect amount of basil on top. The crust (like their regular pizza too) is oven-crunchy. My only complaint is that I don't think the cheese was buffalo mozzarella, it wasn't that deep white.... looked like regular mozz. The pizza was still great tho, I'd get it again for sure. They also have the blood orange San Pellegrino, which adds bonus points in my book.  Delivery is always fast and the drivers are always nice."}
{"text":"The first few times I had pizza from here it was either delivery or someone picked it up and I loved it. Then we went to eat at the restaurant yesterday and I seriously felt like I had lunch at a close friend's house. They were so nice to us and everyone else I saw come and go."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the BBLT. It was quite delicious! They also have a menu that you can get just a slice or two! They are big slices and very reasonably priced. I eat here a lot as they are just down from my business. If your looking for some good pizza shop fare in the neighborhood, I recommend Slice!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Burgh. Great selection of specialty pizza.  The hoagies are delicious.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza and pizza place. Today, they really showed me why. I went late and was telling them how my son received an A on a hard test and as a result, he can pick anywhere to eat. They wrote on the box \"Congrats on your A.\" For being a 7 year old, he was so happy. Thank you to the wonderful, young lady who did that for my son. 
Their pizza has always been perfect and the service has always been excellent. I can't say enough about them."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza - but I just wanted a slice... Slice On Broadway filled my craving and left me wanting more! Staff was exceptional and pizza was amazing will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice big slice of pepperoni pizza $3.75 and $2.50 draft. Not bad priced for being attracted to stadium. Good place to stop in and kill time. Will go there again before a game when in town."}
{"text":"Good guys and the closest to NYC pizza your going to get in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I always order delivery or have a friend pick it up on their way over. Slice is my go to! 

My boyfriend loves the soppressata! The cheese, sauce and crust are delicious, crispy and classic."}
{"text":"Considering Friday night's weather and SLICE's proximity, we were left with no choice but to order in. 

SLICE has a slew of \"specialty pizzas\" with foreboding names such as The Slaughterhouse Five, The Supremo (images of a 50 foot tall oceanic beast wrecking Tokyo are conjured), and The Green Monster...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGP9r1yElg

 We tried the Frisky Billygoat and were astounded by its successful gourmet aspirations, none of which were lost in delivery.

On a rapier-thin crust, the FB is topped with the standard red sauce and mozzarella AND fragmented meatballs to bring the beef, goat cheese (!) to bring more hot , baked cream to the procession, and roasted red peppers for the char and natural sugars. Trolls beware, this billygoat will knock your petty, whiny, finicky ass (did yer ma cut the crusts off of yer pb&j's as a kid?) from the bridge but quick. 

Kay and I also shared one of SLICE's myriad hoagies in The Venetian. With a name that sounds like the title of an independent film, The Venetian gets those who order it a bounty of fixings and fillings that include sopressata, Genoa salami, mozzarella,  provolone, artichoke hearts, fresh spinach, sliced red onions, and a singin', swingin', stingin' house balsamic vinaigrette all held together by a Breadworks baguette. While I could have used more meat in my hero, I was gastronomically impressed with its astronomically imaginative build enough to not mind. I kept thinking I had requested delivery from a cafe, not a pizza parlor. 

Roll the dice, and try SLICE. They put most of their competition on ice. Order twice, thrice..."}
{"text":"The slaughter house pizza was very good. Thin crust but piled high with toppings. Came in on a Thursday afternoon and there was no wait at all. Walked in ordered, grabbed a pop( Boylan Birch Beer) and sat down. Looking over the rest of the menu I will be most likely go out of my way and come back here. 

Pizzas come in 3 sizes. Small, Large and ginormous. I ordered a small and ate half of it and was full. 

I would check this place out sometime. It's worth it"}
{"text":"Slice has opened up at a second location in Carnegie.  Get the same good pizza.  Check out the funny named specialty pizza or order it your way.  The pizza is a thinner crisp crust which I prefer.  The sauce is pretty good too.  The Slice philosophy is to make as much as possible from scratch and use good fresh ingredients. 

The shop is in a little store front with about 5 tables and a few seats in the window.   Also a little room with a big bank type vault door in the back.  It was pretty hot in the shop since it is not air conditioned.  So at this time of year you may want to take out. 

The take out menu states that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pizza.
Liked the tomato sauce, better than some of the more popular places nearby. Darren is correct TKO for sure!
Crust is thinner and crispy.  
Tasty pepperoni."}
{"text":"I live just a couple blocks from Slice on Broadway. It's not my favorite local pizza place but sometimes I'm just really in the mood for it. 

Their pizza is a thinner crust and is 0% greasy. The pizzas are also very reasonable priced. The ginormous pizza is a great value, and man is it huge. 

Even though I live walking distance from the pizza shop, I sometimes get delivery if I'd been drinking or if I have company over. Their delivery services are not long and have never taken longer than estimated. 

They also have lots of coupons that I get in the mail fairly often and they are usually some sort of combo. They're a great deal. 

The workers are also very friendly and are very hard workers. 

I recommend their steak salad, garlic knots, and pineapple pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. You won't be disappointed 
You'll want to come back often
We've stopped in to get the pizza and when we're too tired to drive we have the pizza delivered 
Either way the service is great"}
{"text":"Stopped here while doing some heavy laundry at Sip& Spin.  Walking distance, which made eating pizza guilt free!

Really good, nice atmosphere and beer selection."}
{"text":"Good pizza , these guys usually come through with great food but last night  we ordered a caprese hoagie and couldn't believe how small the portion was ..very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crispy, yet chewy crust, fantastic sauce and all fresh ingredients...

Best pizza in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Delicious and inventive specialty pizza! The hoagies are amazing...Slice always satisfies!"}
{"text":"Went there last night. Seemed like the employee that was helping me was in training. I was the only one in line and instead of attending the register or the customer who was on hold on the phone he was preparing to-go salads WITHOUT GLOVES! It was gross to think he was handling people's food, moving around ingredients in the box, without gloves. After he took my order he dropped one of the slices on the floor and replaced it before putting both in the oven. I thought they were in there for a while but decided not to say anything. By the time I came home, one of the slices was burnt and flavorless. Decided to throw my meal away."}
{"text":"The pizza was not very good. In my opinion the best pizza is in New Jersey and New York. This pizza was sloppily thrown together and messy. The toppings were uneven and the flavor was not good.  I will not order from there again."}
{"text":"Never mind the fact that we live right across the street... but the pizza is amazing. The Fancy Pants is by far one of my all-time favorite ever. Spicy thinly sliced prosciutto, goat cheese, and spinich... Mmmmmm! Funny enough, my second favorite is plain cheese! 

The guys that work there really are the finishing touch on a tasty pizza place. Always nice, friendly, making suggestions, busing tables (even though they really dont have to!) They always remember us, and even bring out \"nice\" glasses when we show up with a bottle of wine. They are true Beechview supporters too, which is what makes Beechview the special \"hidden gem\" neighborhood that it is. 

The newly renovated upstairs makes it a much more spacious place: Sit downstairs for a quick \"slice,\" Or go upstairs with your family for a nice sit down.  In the summer, they put a couple tables out on the sidewalk. 

Hop right on the T when you're done, or wave to it going by!"}
{"text":"Slice On Broadway is a relatively new pizza joint but they have already carved a pretty solid reputation.  I have eaten their pizza a bunch of times now and I can attest to the fact that the pizza is very consistent and you can expect that it will be made the same every time (probably because they have the same pizzaman working there every single time I have been in, he must pull 60 hours a week at least).  They have a little dining room on the main floor and I think there may be a dining room upstairs too but I can't imagine it gets much use.  I ordered a large cheese, which is 16 inches and less than $12 which is a solid price for the quality of ingredient, but truthfully I would have rather paid an extra dollar to not have gotten such a skimpy pie.  


The pizzas are made the traditional way of sliding the pies straight onto a brick oven, the pizzaman is very good at keeping the pies nice a round too.  They do use a bit too much corn meal on the dough and it ends up a bit on the sandy side, also you get some charred black dust remains on the bottom of your pie because they don't clean the oven enough as they go.  The pie was well done and crispy with a nice dark brown color.  This pizza is close to being really good but unfortunately they are a little too skimpy on the everything and what you end up with is a really really dry pizza.  I'm talking Jesus' bones dry.  If you are one of those fat assholes who dips everything in ranch dressing than this pizza very well may be perfect for you but I am having a bit of trouble raw dogging it. 

The dough is pretty plain but it tastes fine.  It doesn't have too much of a distinguishing taste aside from a slight salty breadyness. They are stretching it pretty thin so it is hard to gauge it but it seems like a medium density, slight airiness, a few healthy bubbles in the dough and no doughiness.  The salt in the dough combined with the saltiness of the cheese and the general lack of other flavors ends up making the whole pie a bit too salty.  The dough is a bit on the dry side, which may not have been a bad thing if the rest of the pie didn't follow suit.  Despite being really thin it actually help up very well, you could hold the slices straight without them drooping. I feel like it would not have help up as well if the rest of the pizza hadn't been so lite in the pants.  

The sauce is actually really delicious but they are so brutally skimpy with it that you don't get to taste it at all.  I tried to order it with extra sauce once and instead of putting extra sauce on the pie they just made it as normal and then pooped 2 or 3 odd dollops of sauce oddly in the middle on the top of everything else. The sauce has a really nice garlic sweetness with nice pieces of high quality tomato.  Unfortunately they do the bullseye sauce distribution pattern like most shops around here.  I guess since we are in western PA their thought is that God will distribute the sauce while the pie is cooking.  Keep praying fellas!

They are using high quality mozzarella with some provolone in the mix too, its a nice blend.  The cheese coverage is pretty much perfect too.  They use the most appropriate amount of cheese of any pizza shop in Pittsburgh and it would be awesome if they weren't so stingy about the sauce.  

All in all this place is still better than most of the shops in Pittsburgh just based on how consistent they are.  I wish they would just put enough of their delicious sauce on the pizza.  I hope the 10 cents per pie they are saving on the sauce is worth having such dry pizza, I really do.  I hope that there is a guy in the Bahamas right now just swimming Scrooge McDuck style in all of the tomatoes that didn't end up on my pizza.

{"text":"Okay, what did I do wrong people?  I am going against the grain... I didn't like the pizza... Is there a secret to ordering here?

I had to go El Boro with a regular pepperoni and mushroom pizza to please the masses.  Should I have ordered something else?  I admit, I do like Chicago style, deep dish the best, but I've had my share of thin crust that I've dug.  

Now, everyone's really going to hate me... the pizza crust was like cardboard, the cheese was rubbery and there was hardly any sauce on it.  There, I said it.  Sorry!

So is there something else I should be getting here or did I just come on an off day?  I'm open to suggestions... this place is in my hood and rocks so many of your worlds, what's the secret!?"}
{"text":"They have gone downhill recently. Burned crust. Cold late deliveries. This is specifically the Carnegie location."}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza place in this area! I love going in for a slice or two or ordering from home. All the people that work there and deliver to us are really kind and the food is consistently awesome. They have the best ranch as well!"}
{"text":"Overview:
We were passing through on our way to Chicago and stopped to see a few sights.  We asked a local where the best pizza was and he sent us to Slice on Broadway, and are we glad he did.  I couldn't stop thinking about the crust, the pizza was cooked perfectly and they seem to pride themselves on high quality ingredients. 

Pizza Shop:  Great shop, very clean and welcoming feel to it.  I like that the kitchen is mostly open to the dinning area.  Unique \"vault,\" from when this place was a bank, creates a special private room for a family of 4 or 5 to dine.  The kids loved it.  I also always check out bathrooms, because if a place wants to cut corners the bathroom is a good place because not many guests see it.  These were spotless!

Service:  The staff was second to none.  Our order was taken promptly and all food came out accurate.  They were very friendly and attentive all while giving us space to enjoy our great meal. 

Pizza: I like that you can get pizza by the slice here and that was one thing the local pointed out when sending us here.  That way each of the kids could get their own topping and the slice would be ready for a quick grab and go.  We were so charmed by the staff and setting that we decided to eat in house. 

     Crust: awesome, made the biggest impression on me, perfectly crispy without being over cooked or too well done.  It was some of the best crust I have tasted and I still think about it. 
     Sauce: Good flavor, could tell that it was likely homemade.  
     Cheese: nice blend of mozzarella and provolone.  Perfect amount.  
     Toppings: Pineapple was standard, then again, who the heck puts pineapple on a pizza! Sausage was good.  I prefer sliced over the crumbed but the benefit of how this place does it (crumbed/clumped) was that you had a good sausage flavor in every bite.  

Salad:  Above average pizza place salad, no iceberg lettuce, good veggies

Usually I have something negative to say, but this was such an overall positive experience that nothing stands as negative.  This would definitely be my pizza shop if I was a local and is also a great stop for anyone passing through that wants to grab a slice!"}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh on Sunday to shop at Ikea.  Asked Google what the best pizza in the 'burgh was and the Slice was listed among many others.  I crave New York style pizza with a passion, and Cleveland just doesn't have any I would consider good \"New York\" style.
Man, am I glad that we went here.  The pizza was awesome.  Thin crust and crispy, just the way it is supposed to be. I had the pepperoni, while my wife had the margarita.  We both loved it.
Now about the atmosphere.  It's a simple hole in the wall.  But the music is great, and the cooks were singing along with the Italian music that was playing.  We simply loved it.
The best part was, while getting a box for the leftovers, I added another large slice and a Coke Zero for the ride back to the 'Land, and the manager added it for no charge.  Free, in other words.  Awesome!

Highest recommendation.  Can't wait to go back to the 'Burgh for some more great pizza."}
{"text":"Slice you did it again!  Friendly service, fast delivery, and delicious food!  PLUS they offer cheesecake now!  We ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  It was probably one of the best I've ever had.  For our entrees we got two ultra mega chicken hoagies.  They are grilled chicken, onions, banana peppers, bacon, provolone cheese, and spicy ranch all on a freshly baked hoagie roll.  Their bread comes from a local bakery, so it's always nice and fresh tasting!Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, then MAYBE I could give an honest review. 

We ordered two salads at 5pm and were told there was a 45 minute delivery time. At 6:50 pm, our salads arrived, and....they were wrong. I asked for no onions or green peppers and instead got heaping piles of them. I wanted balsamic dressing, but I guess they wanted me to have ranch instead. Although after seeing the sludge they call \"balsamic dressing\", I may have lucked out. My boyfriend's salad had this dark grey meat that was allegedly \"steak\" and unfortunately he had the sludge-y balsamic dressing.

We did call the restaurant and were given some pathetic excuse about a \"new guy in the kitchen\". The manager offered 20% off of our next order, but....there won't be one. Thanks anyway Slice.

There are many other decent pizza/salad/sandwich places that deliver, and in under two hours too!"}
{"text":"I love Slice so much, and I wish I lived closer to any of their locations.  I get a whole pie with just hot soppressata. Simple and perfect.  Ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes at lunch time."}
{"text":"Let's face it. Pizza is always pretty good no matter where you get it from. However, every time I get a SLICE at SLICE on Broadway, it tastes better and better and better!! And the price can't be beat for the quantity and quality. The restaurant is bright, nicely decorated, and clean and has a few tables/seats so that you can enjoy your food there, or take it to go. They also have delivery service on the weekends if you prefer to have your food brought to you. I'm a big fan of their hand crumbled spicy sausage for the toppings, and the specialty margherita pizza!!
I am really happy to have a great business run by good people in my neighborhood like this and look forward to enjoying a Slice on Broadway for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Yo, these dudes is weird son. I was exactly two blocks away from them and they deliver, but not to the place I was at. Even though I gave them exact directions from google. Oh well, that $32 order and $8 tip went elsewhere. I used to be okay with their in-store slices but I guess I will be giving them a pass as well in the future. So sad, too bad. PS \"what would jesus do\" ;)"}
{"text":"Today I ordered their Veggie Pie which is a combination of fresh baby spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, black olives, green peppers, roasted red peppers, and sliced red onions. Vegetable pizza is almost sac religious for some but this was absolutely AMAZING. The crusts even stayed very crispy which is usually a problem when you order lots of veggies on a pizza. I would think their other pizza options are just as fantastic. SOB is my new pizza delivery go to."}
{"text":"I once ate slice on Broadway two days in a row and didn't even feel guilty about it. This place is hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. The crust is thin and crispy and the sauce is perfectly zesty. I always order a standard pepperoni pizza and I have never been let down- quality is consistent and honestly for the price (~$20 for an XL) you can NOT beat it. 

Each time I've called to order delivery their staff has always been friendly even in times where I assume they are extremely busy. I never feel rushed by them to place my order and you have the option to pay over the phone with a credit card which is extremely convenient. 

The ONLY downside is their delivery seems to always take about an hour or so, which has me impatiently hawking at my door awaiting the arrival of the delivery man. However,  I assume that's because they are making everything fresh, which takes time, so I can't knock them for that. 

Id eat this pizza hot, cold, luke warm- whatever temperature, anywhere, any day, anytime- it's seriously that good. I love you slice on Broadway, never change."}
