{"text":"Excellent food!! We're Dutch and know our German food! This is so authentic!! Loved the schnitzel and the Wurst Platte. Furthermore, my daughter has a dairy free diet and they were very flexible about that. That is really very rare,so we would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Guten appetit!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last week. The food was great but the service was so-so. The waitress was so neglectful that the bus-boy offered to fill our drinks and take our plates. We will definitely try it again though. The food was worth it. :) P.S. The German potato salad is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty!  Kind of an 'early bird special' place but the food made up for it.  Schnitzel was very good!"}
{"text":"Had the veal paprikas, perogies and 2 on tap beers.  You know when you first see a place and finally eat there for the first time you have expectations.  This place was better than i ever could of dreamed of.  I love this place.  Try it.  You will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"Very authentic German menu. Great Schnitzel and potato pancakes! Very tasty german potato salad! Great Warsteiner Ratler! Great Beer selection and Garden! The complimentary bread is fresh, tasty and warm."}
{"text":"Four taps is a fine amount of beer but not when it's all oxidized. Super bummer. Food was mediocre at best. A solid meh if not for the prices. Too high for bad food and stale beer."}
{"text":"Very good food! Loved the atmosphere and service also. My husband loved the red cabbage. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just went here again, service was amazing, and the food, omg the food!  If you aren't going here, why not?  It's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My family from Florida came to visit us in Ohio, and we decided to do German cuisine one night.  Found Das Schnitzel Haus on yelp, and decided to give it a try.    The service is the first thing to evaluate in my opinion.  We were seated rather quickly, and the server was friendly.  It seemed there were times where she was a bit overwhelmed with servicing other tables.  So because of that, we had to wait for quite some time on drinks, and our appetizer.  Other than that, it was pretty decent.  The food was very tasty!  My nieces, and nephews loved the potato pancakes, and the schnitzels were pretty good, but not blow you away type stuff.  I really liked the German potato salad, but the spaetzel was probably my least favorite item.  It was a bit dried out with really no flavor to it.  My brother in-law absolutely loved the red cabbage, and said it was the best he ever had.  All in all, the food was well done.  I would recommend giving Das Schnitzel Haus a try.  There were many more things on the menu that sounded great, but will have to try later.  For those of you with kids, they do offer typical American foods for them.  Most kids are too picky to try something new like German food.  There are also plenty of beers to choose from for the beer fans out there.  Thanks Schnitzel Haus for a good time."}
{"text":"Great place! Been a couple of times. No one is let down.  Do eat here!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Excellent schnitzel (veal and pork were both delicious), we loved the pierogi and the sauerkraut balls!! Seriously, if you like sauerkraut you'll love these, fried to perfection sooo good! Service was friendly but a tad slow, and prices are a bit steep, but very cozy atmosphere and the food was great so can't complain."}
{"text":"Delicious food, family owned, Warsteiner on tap, comfortable environment? Sounds like perfection to me. I was a first timer at Das Schnitzel Haus, and I will definitely be back! It was quite crowded when myself and D. went, but it led to a pleasantly loud, festive atmosphere. We were served deliciously warm, crusty bread with butter along with our Warsteiners.    I got the jager schnitzel with german potato salad and spaetzle and D got the schnitzel platter with german potato salad and sauerkraut. My dish was fantastic! Creamy goat cheese, peppers and onions and a thinly pounded, breaded but not greasy pork. Potato salad was tangy, sweet and a little vinegar-y.. perfection. Spaetzle was just how my mom used to make. D inhaled his plate and talked about their sauerkraut for the next three days. The schnitzel was cooked perfectly, slightly crunchy skin and had a great flavor. Three Warsteiners later, we were perfectly content.   Waitstaff was great, very friendly and clearly gave us some great suggestions on what to order. Will I be back? Hell yes!"}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden gem. The food was great and home made quality. Dina was fantastic! We were in town for business and was looking for a great local non-chain restaurant. I would highly recommend if you love great German food."}
{"text":"We passed by this joint on our way to Seoul Garden to meet friends for dinner. My friend with me was so excited to see this restaurant and asked if we can go there next time because she misses eating german apple strudel and since I already bookmarked this place for my next food adventure- I said yes. yey!!  After having dinner, the group decided to get desserts. Instead of going to the usual applebee's, we decided to go here and make one of my friends' dream come true!:) (i fulfilled my good deed for the day)  Upon arriving, we were greeted promptly and then seated on our table within 10mins. Our server was very attentive and helpful. He forgot to refill our coffee but made up for it with a joke that guys can't really multitask.(i always thought that they can, they just don't listen..) anyways, the cheesecake was awesome, very fluffy and not too sweet. The black forrest though was ok but the cake is really dry.. my friend's apple strudel was of decent portion and was gone before i can even snap a picture of it, so i think it was really good. I'll have to go back here on an empty stomach so I can have a decent schnitzel experience which has pretty good reviews from other yelpers.:)"}
{"text":"Great food and a fantastic staff! The atmosphere was great and the beer was cold. I had the wurst platter and it was delicious. My wife had the chicken schnitzel with delicious cabbage and noodles. Oh and the bread was amazing!!! A solid restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here solo as I continue my search for authentic and delicious Hungarian goulash.  The food was very disappointing. Spaetzle flunked on taste and texture.  I knew when I got the meal that the highlight was the bread.   Service was atrocious and they were not very busy.  Only one waitress visit throughout the meal.  I would not go back except to try the Schnitzel or bratwurst to see if those dishes are better. But service must be improved.  I put blame on owner who was on site that day."}
{"text":"I had a great meal, I took my servers advice on the beer too,  its a shame I\"m only passing thru on business, or I'd certainly be a repeat customer,."}
{"text":"Now I have eaten German food more than the average Joe... I've been to Columbus, Cleveland restaurants, and even some German festivals/October fests.... BUT nothing beats the food they have here. Yes the restaurant was packed on a Friday night but with the food being so delicious I'm not surprised! Maybe next time I will make a reservation.  To start the staff is extremely nice and willing to answer any questions about the menu. When I was there I actually couldn't decide on sides and the owner (was was also the hostess) sent me a bowl of purple cabbage for free just because she thought I had to try it! They give you some great bread to start off with then the meals are massive! It was all so delicious though. Like I said, I think the best German food I've ever eaten.   I highly recommend you go here!"}
{"text":"I've been 3 times now. The food is authentic German and very good. I've had different Schnitzel dishes every time I've went and they were delicious. Portions are large and a good value. Service was fast and friendly. The owners were nice. They have a beer list and some decent beers but you need to ask for a list. Why not just have it out always? They give some bottle beers with the wrong glass. Wheat beer served in a KÃ¶lsch glass? There are reasons why the different beer have different glasses especially a wheat beer.  Perhaps they are not aware of this. Other then my beer snob glass issue, I enjoyed the food so much. I shall return soon!"}
{"text":"Very authentic food, loved all of it. The beer selection is great too.Our server was great and I realize it was a slow night but the other staff all had their coats on to go home and started putting the chairs upside down on the tables while we were eating. We just felt like we were visiting someone that was just waiting for us to leave. The server apologized and told us to take our time when I asked if we were holding them up. Kind of impersonal considering I go here at least once a month for the past few years."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, the server helped us pick out a couple entrees and even though it was slow, she was super high energy and engaging. I ended up getting the schnitzel platter, I'm not even sure what I was eating but it was amazing. Definitely a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Solid german beer selection and schnitzel was nicely breaded and browned but the spatzle...so so."}
{"text":"We took my mom and dad there this past week for Mother's Day. We had not been there before so we did not know what to expect. Overall we were pleased by the dining experience. The food was both tasty and plentiful.  The veal schnitzel was very moist and the breading was fried very crispy. They have have several German dishes to choose from and they offer a sampler plate if you can not decide on one dish. They also have several German and domestic beers to choose from. We will definitely be back, :)"}
{"text":"I was here once a few years ago and it was ok. Nothing special.  But Good Grief change ur sign once in awhile.  Seriously. .make your fathers day reservations up in September still?. I know Im a bit fussy but ready to climb the ladder for u. ok..update...went on sunday by request of family and had THE WORST sauerbraten ever. It wasn't even good roast beef in brown gravy. Dad couldn't eat sauerkraut because it was loaded with salt(he rarely turns away from anything). Want to like the place, just can't. Big portion,but went to waste along with the $ 15."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for Mother's Day. The server was very quick and friendly. We enjoyed the the patio. My parents enjoyed the authentic German dishes. Looking forward to a visit this summer again."}
{"text":"Wow, EPIC FAIL!   While we enjoyed the food, the service was awful! We sat down at 6:45, and waited 25 mins to see our server. She very rudely took our food and drink order before disappearing. She brought our drinks, bread, and my salad very quickly, but then disappeared again. We waited for over an hour for our food, and in that time our server never once came to the table to get us refills or offer us more bread, or let us know the status of our order.    Turns out she didn't even put the order in until 7:45, 35 mins after we placed it.  I've heard of holding orders to let the kitchen catch up, but this was extreme. When the food finally arrived,  she hurried off without getting us refills and by the time she came back to get us actually refills, we were all midway through our meals.    She made sure she dropped off the check as soon as we were finished eating, but then made us wait 30 mins before coming back to pick it up. When we requested to speak with a manager, her response, \"She's busy, can I help you with something?\" No, we'd like to speak to a manager. The owner's daughter came out, and when we told her how rude the server was, she apolgized, and told us \"she's rude until you get to know her.\" Now I'm not going to take the time to get to know her, I'm here to have dinner with my family, not become friends with the server.  The owner did eventually end up coming to see us, but she just made excuses. She ended up removing the sodas from the bill, but it wasn't enough. Now had it been just my wife and I, drinking and having nowhere else to go, we would have been fine with a 2 1/2 hour meal, but the fact that we had our kids with us really made the situation unacceptable.  As good as the food was, we won't be back, and I recommend you avoid the place.   Server Peggy = Someone who should be doing something that doesn't involve dealing with people!"}
{"text":"Holy mackerel. This place is crazy. As in, crazy good. Like, lose your Scheisse good.   Now, I'm the type of girl who prefers a salad over anything meat-oriented any day of the week, in general because I prefer green things and am vaguely health-conscious (or at least pretend to be). EXCEPT, of course, when I'm at the Schnitzel Haus. It's a good thing that I live nowhere near Parma, or else I'd have to start measuring my weight in multiple powers of 10. This is because the portions are ENORMOUS and the beer is FANTASTIC. Let me start with the beer.  I'd had Franziskaner before and was really looking forward to it on draught (not 'draft,' right?), but they were out, sadly. HOWEVER, my brief despair was immediately transformed into delight at the alternative: Koenig Ludwig. DELICIOUS. Get it on draught, and you'll be smitten forever. We also tried the Warsteiner Dunkel on draught, which was pretty amazing--but hefeweizens are my weakness, so long live Koenig Ludwig.  The potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer? is there a better word than that in the world?) are huge and make me lose my mind in their deliciousness. I can only compare them to what I've tasted in Eastern Europe, and these are by far the best I've ever had. They served them with applesauce, but since I am a little Hungarian at heart, I requested sour cream . . . and immediately died with delight. SO GOOD. The various sauerkrauts are also fantastic.   And the schnitzel, WELL. It's the house of Schnitzel, so it speaks for itself. Just delicious. Even my dad, who is notoriously sparing in his compliments (normally he'll grunt if you ask him whether he likes the food), said the schnitzel was \"very good.\" I mean, that's basically a triumphal hymn accompanied by brass fanfare and an organ processional. With Tchaikovsky's 1812 cannons in the background.  To echo a few concerns, service can be somewhat spotty, but we were there last Friday evening, and the young bloke who served us was great, so no complaints there.  Of course, there's another big asterisk next to this review: we didn't have anything green on our table, and (this goes without saying) meatless diets will have a tough time here. However, if your diet allows, go enjoy a hearty German meal and delicious, delicious beer!  Prost!"}
{"text":"We were traveling this summer near Cleveland and in the mood for German food...  So we stopped at Das Schnitzel Haus. Not only did we find tasty German food, but we were THRILLED to find Serbian/Hungarian on the menu. After a super fresh shopska salata and cevapcici, I didn't have much room left for German food, but sampled everything on the Deutche Platte and took A LOT of leftovers with me. The ayvar (served with cevapi) is delicious. The goulash tasted more like saurbraten, but either way, was excellent!! I didn't order the sarma (stuffed cabbage) because I was afraid I'd be disappointed, but judging from the quality, not to mention enormous quantity, of the other dishes, I'll give it a try.  Next time we're in Cleveland Das Schnitzel Haus is on the list!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times and have never had a bad meal. After my last experience I finally decided I needed to share this restaurant with others. The food is primarily German but they also have your standard burger, corned beef, reuben sandwich for the less adventurous. They do have a kids menu that includes chicken strips and grilled cheese among other items.   Below are the items I can recommend: Schweine Schnitzel Rinder Goulash Spetzel Wurst Platte  I was here on New Years Eve 2009 with a party of 15. It was packed in their main part of the restaurant so we were seated in their back room. The service was quick and the food was delicious. Even though they were busy up front they didn't forget about us in the back.   They also have a nice enclosed outdoor patio which is great. I definitely recommend this restaurant, give it a try."}
{"text":"Real German schnitzel and solid beer selection."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Really cool atmosphere. The staff is so friendly. The owner came around and asked us how everything was and talked with us. The schnitzel is out of this world! They have a great beer menu too. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This meal was absolutely amazing. Never really had a lot of German food prior, however I hope there is a place to mirror The Schnitzel Haus back in Baltimore.  Probably coming back here tomorrow for dinner again. Wiener Schnitzel Vom Kalb with brown mushroom gravy was one of the best meals I've ever had.  And if you decide to grab an appetizer, \"Kraut Kugeln (sauerkraut balls) will NOT disappoint!!!!!"}
{"text":"Homely decorated restaurant with friendly staff.  My husband said it was the best German food he has had since living in Belgium!"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The service was a little slow, but nothing terrible. The portions are ridiculously large (get a nice lunch the next day out of your meal!)"}
{"text":"So I had a day to myself and wanted something different.  I don't like chain restaurants much so I searched around and came upon this place.  Took the suggestions from an awesome server there and I couldn't have been more happy.  The food is amazing I don't usually say that.  The staff treated me like family.  I liked the food so much I got another order to take home to my wife.  If you are on the fence you owe it to yourself to try this place out it really is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Parking is a little challenging. First time there, so it was a little confusing trying to figure out how to get a seat. We had to wait for about 25 minutes to get a table, not a big deal but they were extremely busy. We started off with their sauerkraut balls. The outside was crunchy the inside was tangy, sweet and creamy, excellent! We got the Reuben Schnitzel and the Jaeger Schnitzel. The spatzel and red cabbage were also very good. Would most definitely come here again if back in town."}
{"text":"We went there for diner on a Tuesday night. The staff were friendly and was able to help recommend which schnitzel between the two I was thinking about. So glad I went with her suggestion. Their German potato salad is so yummy, the best I've had! And the bread  basket was so good we ask for more. The portions were large that we brought home leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"Large portions, large beers, and a very comfortable place. There is a nice roofed patio room outside for a nice time to relax, or a cozy indoor area which you can spend a nice long supper at. The Reuben schnitzel is probably my favorite food their. There are desserts available for the brave to try, but don't expect to finish your food. I love the bread they give at each table! It isn't cheap to eat here, at least $15 up approximately. Worth the price for what you get. Not the largest parking lot, watch for potholes in it. Very friendly servers. Bathrooms are usually tidy. I don't usually give a full 5 stars, but this place really has good food and makes me happy being at."}
{"text":"When I ordered scheine  schnitzel waitress had no idea what I wanted? Did get one with spaetzle and red cabbage. Meat was good quality and generous portion, breading OK, a bit greasy. Spaetzle was cold and cabbage a bit dried, went in around 5:30 so surprised! Service fine, facilities well worn, loud as more diners arrived. In town for business so might return but nothing to go out of my way for. Loved in Germany for three years so my expectations are based on that experience."}
{"text":"WTF?!?! I haven't reviewed this yet?!?!  Well, let's get this done. I'm not going to get all wordsy or long winded here....     If you love ethnic European food i.e. Schnitzel or Paprikash then you NEED to try Das Schnitzel Haus !! Period. The end.    No, seriously, what the hell are you waiting for? This has got to be the best Schnitzel in CLE. Hands down! This time I had the Jeagar Schnitzel and the wife had Veal Paprikash. Both were AMAZING!!!!      If you don't try this place, too bad. You've been told what you're missing."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken paprikash for weeks and finally found somewhere that had it! I'm so happy I actually gave this place a shot.  The exterior of the restaurant is super cute and so is the inside. They have an awesome patio section which would be great for the summer unfortunately it was too cold so we sat inside. Our waitress was very friendly and prompt! We ordered pork skewers for an app and thought 7 bucks was a bit much for just two but they were pretty good. They give you complimentary bread which is DELICIOUS! So then my boyfriend ordered the hungarian goulash and I order my paprikash. The portions were huge! I had dinner, a late night snack and then breakfast from one plate of it. I'll definitely be back asap."}
{"text":"The only downside of this restaurant is that sometimes service can be a little slow. With that being said, however, I love it here! The food is ALWAYS amazing. I love their veal schnitzel and mashed! I have taken several friends visiting the area here simply because we love it so much."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is fantastic.    The hold back on the 5 stars is just a few small items; but the food I outstanding.    So, bad news first.  They never brought a beir list as asked and the interior, while comfy and warm is a little too dated.    For the positives, the food is about as authentic as you are going to find anywhere.  I lives in Germany for 5 years and this is pretty dang close.  They have a pretty good menu selection without going over board and making things too complicated.  Keeping it simple and focused serves them well.    The schnitzels und wurst plates are perfect.  They will seem expensive on the initial glance, but the portions are big and the flavor is spot on.  The pasta and cabbage is worth eating on its own.  The sauerkraut is amazing.  The potato salad is German, but it is sweet.  I am not sure of the region.  My wife loved it, I did not.  Great place for friends and family.  No need to scream over the noise."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and decided to introduce my wife and 4yr old to it. My wife had the lamb shank special and was in heaven it was completely fall off the bone delicious. My daughter tried the schnitzel and couldn't stop. I had the Dautshe Platte and it was excellent as always. This place never disappoints and the staff are friendly and very efficient our food came out quickly even at 6pm on a Saturday. We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way, i enjoyed Das Schnitzel Haus. That said, there were some issues.  We showed up shortly after 8pm on a Saturday. The young man who would eventually be our server told us that he had a table available in about 5-10 minutes but invited us to sit out in the covered \"beer garden\" area where there was seating already available and heating.  That seating turned out to be patio furniture and the heating was a fireplace with 2 dudes sitting in front of it for way too long. if there was other heating it very quickly was not enough. Danielle was freezing. The owner/manager came over and invited us to move and placed a blanked of unidentified origin on D's shoulders. Gross. It got cold enough that others seated in the area after us ate fast enough they were done eating before we were so they could return to the warmth of their cars. Our fault, we should have opted to wait. The initial server who came by asked if we'd ordered and we hadn't even seen a menu yet (10 minutes into being seated). She brought us menus which we had just opened. We weren't even provided a beer menu and as a result I got an diet soda when she could have up-sold me on what i hear are great German beers.  We finally ordered. Danielle had the Schweine \"wiener art\" (Pork) Schnitzel w/ kraut and spaetzle. She really liked it. I had the Deutche Platte w/ is a sampler of sorts and includes Weinershnitzel, Bratwurst and Goulash. I got cabbage & noodles a German potato salad as sides. I should add that the reason i got this dish was that i wanted the goulash. what i got was schnitzel, bratwurst and pot roast/Sauerbraten. after looking at the pictures here on Yelp, that seems to be exatly what others got as well. It was delicious but i wanted goulash. Also, the potato salad was too sweet. I prefer my GPS to be more on the sour side.  I'm sure we'll go back. Everything was very good. Our server (Zach, i think) was very polite and friendly.  And I'd like to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Schnitzel was moist instead of dry as it has been at other restaurants.  Portions are large and the service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance and it continues to disappoint. Very expensive,  $16.95 for a weak Jaegerschnitzel that looked and tasted like cream of mushroom soup with rubbery canned mushrooms. The salad was not very exciting, a bit of iceberg and a tomato. Frankly I expected better at these prices. Additionally, the four waitresses were running around like mad, therefore the service was not attentive. Not going back."}
{"text":"A disappointment - I wish we had gone to the Little Polish Diner.  We came here for lunch on our quest for Pierogies at Rudy's.  The Yelp photos looked good.  I wanted a schnitzel sandwich.  When I found out another sandwich cam on a pretzel roll - I asked for a substitute, they obliged, but the sandwich was pretty dry.  I ordered it with German potato salad and sauerkraut (which had little pieces of Kielbasa in it, and was the highlight of my plate).  We had also ordered the Kraut balls - that come deep fried with kielbasa and cheese, but our waiter forgot them.  My husband got the goulash - which was also pretty underwhelming."}
{"text":"Best German food since my trip to Germany!"}
{"text":"Great German restaurant in Cleveland. The Goulash is excellent... The beef just falls apart. Pork & Veal Schnitzel are both good and recommend.   There are 3 great choices for German cuisine in Cleveland and this is one of them."}
{"text":"A group of us visited on a very, very busy Saturday evening. Parking was minimal. There was a 45 minute standing wait next to tables which were full of dinners and the line progressed out the door. The hostess appeared overwhelmed and lacked organization with taking names or seating correctly in order of arrival. It also seemed as though people who went in the patio entrance  were able to seat themselves. Our male server was pleasant and attentive. Our dinners were great; we all had the veal schnitzel. The beer .... delicious. The only food complaint: sauerkraut balls $7.50 for 4 were cold on the inside. I would definitely go again!  Visited January 2016"}
{"text":"Great food but disrespectful, rude servers. Second time here asked if bread came with meal last time it did. Server said that it does not come with sandwiches but last time it did. So no big deal until the server Nicky throws a basket of bread on the table without saying anything. Very rude and in a rush could not even enjoy the food. Rushed with the check.  If you decide to go here don't have Nicky wait on you."}
{"text":"My daughter and son-in-law recently moved to Parma. We had learned that the area is extremely culturally diverse. So we sought out something different, and discovered this wonderful gem! The German food was phenomenal! And more than that, the owner, Bronca and her staff treated us like royalty! Being that we were not familiar with the cuisine, she allowed us to sample certain items before ordering. Everyone had something different, and it was all wonderful! Two items which stood out that all mankind have to have from here are the German potato salad and the potato pancakes!!! Wonderful!!! My wife and I will be flying back to Cleveland in the coming months, and going to dinner here will be a priority!!!  Returned during a recent visit at Thanksgiving! Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Place is sophisticated in casual way, best. go for back room with the bar for a Cavs game and you are CLE select. you may even hear Gloria Estefan beats and strong old German bearded men laugh together, vibe. Recommendation when you have low risk tolerance for bs in ohio city or tremont. Schnitzel is one of my favorite dishes. how about pork schnitzel, cabbage and noodles, and the best german potato salad i have ever had. Gaffel kolsch is from Cologne and one of best beers in world, not much more to say for those who have not tasted one yet. my crew will run through here every now and again or I can go solo and enjoy bar stool for dinner. Bier garten patio is near perfection and look at all audis and bmws, i'd race you if i wasn't exhausted after all the pork schnitzel."}
{"text":"After not being able to find a outstanding German restaurant in the Akron / Cuyahoga Falls. We drove 30 mins to Parma Ohio. And we are glad we did. We were on the hunt for great Pirogi and we found just that at Das Schnitzel Haus in Parma.  The bread was fantastic and fresh baked. And the pirogi were fantastic. The sauteed onions were cooked perfectly and soft and delicious.  Next came the Wurst Platte but the Wurst plate turned out to be the best plate. The Bratwurst was perfectly cooked and delicious the knockwurst was also perfectly cooked and delicious and finally the Hungarian sausage was perfect as well. Add a side of perfectly cooked spetzel and home made mash potatoes and gravy and your in for quite a treat. I highly highly recommend you stop in for a visit. The service was outstanding as well except having to wait 20-30 mins to refill my water. Other than that outstanding service and friendly service. Plan your trip to Das Schnitzel Haus today .."}
{"text":"First and last time here ! Driving by saw a sign for stuffed peppers and it sounded great ! Sat down ordered and right away oh sorry we just ran out a minute ago ! Well the only reason I stopped was for the peppers I think maybe they should make enough to make it past 5 pm on a Saturday and remove it from the sign on the street"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here twice and both times it the experience was amazing! Fantastic customer service and amazing food. It is a small and very busy place so its best to have a reservation.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Come here for the authentic German food!  A friend and I came her and had a great meal.  I had the Hungarian Goulas, and she had the Jagrschitzel.  Both were really good, but I was jealous of hers as it was WAY better.  Servings are gigantic, and I highly suggest you get the cabbage and noodles as a side.    The beer selection was nice, and loaded with many German beers.  Some of which I had never heard of before."}
{"text":"The best German/Easter European restaurant in Cleveland.  Good German beers on tap.  Wonderful home-made bread.  And delicious, authentic German food.  One of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there about 6:00. We waited 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us by saying \" You'll have to wait\". After another 15 minutes my wife asked a waitress if we are supposed to seat ourselves. She says you can wait in the bar. I looked around there were tables open. At one table, the patrons were mad because they didn't get their check for 50 minutes, another was waiting for boxes, one table had their food and the rest were waiting for their food. I figured this place is in no big hurry to serve anybody. And the prices aren't cheap."}
{"text":"This restaurant is run expertly by a very sweet pleasant eastern european woman.  I ALWAYS get Hollsteiner Schnitzel, home fries and red cabbage.  Also great European draft beers."}
{"text":"Wanted try try this place after seeing it featured on New Day Cleveland and boy I'm glad I did!  I got the turkey schnitzel which came with 2 patato pancakes and my wife got the veal schnitzel with red cabbage and German potato salad. Both dishes were very good!! As stated in other reviews, the portions are very large so we both took some good home. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Relatively close to Cleveland Hopkins airport if you're craving decent, non-airport food, before or after a flight. Which is exactly how we ended up here. We had some time to kill and wanted some local pierogies and spatzle stat. This was the only place that was open at 11:30am on a Saturday so we gave it a try! Be sure to check out their daily specials for both lunch and dinner!   Fav: The food was good, as was the beer. Oddly enough, the gurkensalat (cucumber salad) was probably my favorite out of everything we tried.   Spatzle: The spatzle has swiss cheese mixed with it, which, as someone who makes this stuff at home, I feel is an instant copout. To those who care, it screams \"this spatzle isn't made to order!\" Sure it was tasty but come on. It had that leftover mac and cheese feel to it.   Sauerkraut: Behold, the direct route to my eastern European heart. To me the sauerkraut is the bottom line in determining the overall quality of a place. I'm probably the only person who feels this way but it works. Their sauerkraut is damn good. I really don't have to say more!  Pierogies: Ehhhh. Not bad. Also not great.    Beer Garden: The front beer garden area is great. I wish I lived nearby as I'd probably have every party in the future in that spot. It's an awesome space that was rented out for a shower when we were here. The guests seemed to be having a good time and the staff assigned to the party were super attentive from what I saw.   Accessibility: The only downside is the place isn't very handicapped friendly. Sure they have quite possibly the longest wrap around ramp I've ever seen in my life...I'm not sure if that's for accessibility reasons, or just for really drunk people reasons. Either way, if only they put the same effort into handicap accessible bathrooms, they'd get another star.   My mom uses a walker - getting her through the restaurant, down the few steps, and to the bathroom was an ordeal. On the difficulty scale it was probably an 8 because once we got to the bathroom it was still slippery after they mopped it up (they didn't have a sign - just an ajar door to air it out), her walker didn't fit in the bathroom, and I had to hold her to make sure she didn't fall. I feel horrible for anyone in a wheelchair because that's just not happening. While the food was good it's something to keep in mind if you're considering coming here for the first time!"}
{"text":"Really good german food. So difficult to choose what to order. But - the pierogies were just so-so. The beer selection could be a lot better. And it's kind of expensive."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. The big issue here isn't the food, which was fine (standouts included the house bread, veal schnitzel, and cabbage and noodles). The issue was service. Our waiter failed to put in our order of pierogi (apparently Cleveland pierogi come strangely fried and the size of your fist, not the usual finger-sized boiled or pan fried versions), despite multiple attempts to confirm. We ran out of water repeatedly and needed to flag down other servers to get refills. The same with our check. And despite being a mostly empty restaurant, several items came out to the table only lukewarm. In a city with better options, I'm not sure I would come back again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken paprikash and it was good but had  better though. Sauce was more runny then I like and I didn't taste no sour cream in the sauce. When you first walk in there is no check in place to give your name. Had to walk in the back by the bar where I saw other  people do that. They really need a hostess area. Other then that it was ok.  I would go back"}
{"text":"Another bookmarked place I've been meaning to try and am so glad I did. I even had dinner here with a Cleveland native who had never been, so I'm spreading the love. This is truly great German food, served in a setting that is both traditional and casual. I had the jÃ¤ger schnitzel, a pork schnitzel with creamy mushroom sauce. The sauce was great; not too creamy, so not a fat bomb, with mushrooms that I suspect were canned, but were still good, so I'm not docking them a star for it. The pork was perfectly fried and delicious. Two sides came with my main, and I opted for the purple cabbage and German potato salad. Both were tasty, with a bit of sweetness that was a pleasant counterpoint to the schnitzel. Yummy, yummy food. They cook with a skilled and restrained hand here, and nothing I ate could have been improved upon. I tried a bit of my partner's apple strudel with creme anglaise for dessert, and that was delicious too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having lived in Germany for almost a decade, I was looking for something close to authentic. This came pretty close. I had the Jagger Schnitzel  (fortunately there was a half order avaliable). The portion was large. It was delicious except the gravy was a bit thick, but overall good. I was able to get a side of Kartoffel Kueglen for an extra charge. Well worth it. I love a good potato pancake and this made the grade. I also had the red cabbage which was authentic and good.   This review warrants 5 stars but I must withhold one because of my experince. A lady who worked there (possibly an owner) came through the dining room and visited three tables speaking German to the patrons. Nothing deep, just asking how they were. She did not come to my table (which was one of the 4 occupied tables). I wasn't sure what to make of this, because I happen to be a woman of color. Maybe she did not speak English (this is me giving her the benefit of the doubt) and assumed I did not speak german. Had she stopped by my table, she would have found that I also speak german. My point - treat all customers the same. A smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"Being of German decent this brings me back to my moms cooking. Truly home made on premises. Right down to the red cabbage. I'm glad I don't live close, I would be the size of Oklahoma!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Las Vegas, wanted GOOD variety of German food so my wife and I decided to split the German plate.  The waiter decided we should pay extra for the split, where they generously divided it for us which resulted in extra portions of mediocre food when it was already more than we could eat in the first place.  I don't understand this logic of \"give them enough, they won't notice how bad it is\" nonsense.  I had a choice of 4 German places in the area, obviously we chose the wrong one.  Not the wurst (pun intended) German food we have had, but really close!  With the large German population in Cleveland area, we had much higher expectations."}
{"text":"Pretty good German food. Very large portions. Part of the restaurant is like a beer garden with a very airy enclosed porch. If you can convince the waitress you are German she might comp you with bottle of German wine. I was surprised when my brother, who was visiting from Germany, got one. Just go for the decent food -- really!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken paprikash and it was awful. The chicken looked and tasted like it was canned and the spaetzel was boiled and not fried at all so it was soggy. The flavor was off and the sauce was very thin. For a restaurant that takes pride in being a good ethnic place it's not for chicken paprikash. Also ordered the chicken schnitzel that comes in the lemon sauce, the sauce had no flavor and the chicken wasn't seasoned. Again soggy spaetzel. We were so so disappointed and are still looking for a neighborhood place that makes good paprikash."}
{"text":"I love this place and everyone teases me because it's an \"old people restaurant.\" It tastes just like the German foods my mom and my grandma make. The only difference is their cabbage and noodles has bacon in it and my family's doesn't.   I love, love, love the sauerbraten and the puten schnitzel. It's so delicious. And the potato pancakes! Mmm I'm about to start drooling. The only thing they have here that I'm not so big on are the sauerkraut balls. Instead of the warm sauerkraut that you'd get with a meal, it's more like coleslaw balls. Inside is a cold, creamy cabbage type salad. Not my thing, but it wasn't bad. I'll just eat more potato pancakes next time.   I wish this place would do some updating inside. The booths always feel kinda gross and sticky.  Also, the service is pretty slow. It's not bad if you have a beer to enjoy, but don't expect to get in and out really quickly."}
{"text":"Went to Das Schnitzel Haus for lunch today.  The person I went with did not want a full sized dinner for lunch so we opted to share the jaeger schnitzel. We were told there was a $3 charge for sharing, but the kitchen would be putting it on two individual plates. When they arrived,  it ended up being 2 full sized dinners!  The food was wonderful and the staff was extremely friendly! I would highly recommend this restaurant.   The only \"negative\" would be the inside is a little small and dark, but the food makes up for this."}
{"text":"Authentic German food!! So delicious. Been here a few times and have always gotten a nice staff member. Good atmosphere. I should also mention the warm bread they serve before your meal... Mmm!!"}
{"text":"Old, heavy, traditional comes to mind. Definitely an experience, if you are in the mood. I'm glad I went to mix things up. Great potato pancakes and their homemade sandwich bread is huge and fantastic."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was inviting and server was friendly but the service was very slow and inattentive. We were seated immediately upon arrival but it was over 10 minutes before we were offered a beverage and the server seldom checked with us to see how our meal was going. After we received the bill we waited over 20 minutes for her to return to collect payment, we finally had to go up to the host so we could pay, the server never came back to our table to take our payment. Once our orders were placed it was over 30 minutes before our food was served. The Turkey Ruben lacked flavor but was still ok. My husband had the Chicken Paprikash, the sauce/gravy was more of a mushroom base than a sour cream base but the dumplings were cooked perfectly and the chicken fell off the bone.   I've heard only good reviews about Das Schnitzel Haus so I am willing to give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  Between the two of us we ordered 4 meals, 3 appetizers, and 4 sides, and a salad (gurken salat was so refreshing) because we didn't want to miss anything lol.  The food was the best German I've ever had, and my date was hesitant to say it... but agreed.  She ran a German restaurant for 7 years and the cook/owner was a Master chef.  Wolfgang puck was not uncommon to show up as they attented school together.  But she stated they stood toe to toe.  Melissa was an great server and really made the great food an entertaining experience as well.  We must have been having fun because the owner migrated to our table and hung out.  I feel like I left with new friends.  What more could you ask for?  Get there this is a MUST!!  Oh I almost forgot.  They have a great patio that can be used in winter and summer but I didn't use it.  The beer list was very nice too."}
{"text":"One of the best Wiener Schnitzels I have had in the U.S.  The amount of food you get here is comparable to the price you pay. The Sauerbraten is also tasty.  Due to the distance from where we live we only visit Das Schnitzel Haus on rare occasions. With that said, we never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was overall good. My Bratwurst and Knockwurst came out pretty wrinkly and over cooked.The four very large potato cakes were yummy but could of been the entire meal. They really dish a ton of food for the prices. I wonder if Chef Ramsey would be screaming at them for that lol.  The outside\" Beer Garden\" is just a built on extension room next to the main road. I could clearly see the people in the next door residences go about their business.If you don't look past the walls its nice. I get their reasoning but poor execution. The service is poor. I saw only two servers and the owner (I am assuming). They were fairly busy and the one guy server was running around so fast we had to jump out of his way. He apologized and no worries. Unfortunately we had the other girl server whom was the polar opposite and took forever to acknowledge us and was absent for large chunks of times. In a nutshell. It is a worthy choice for a dinner.. as long as you are an extremely patient person with nowhere else you need to be."}
{"text":"Greta german food and beer selection. This is authentic food they cook and serve in this restaurant. Server is very attentive and great knowledge. There are too many good choices, and I will definitely back to try other choices."}
{"text":"I want to preface this by saying I have been here on multiple occasions and always had great food and good service. That is the only reason the rating is not a 1. I also rarely write reviews, but we hadn't even seen our waitress yet before I started jotting notes in my phone for this. The food ended up being great but the service was horrible.  We arrived at approximately 8pm on a Saturday, kind of expecting it to be somewhat busy but not bad. It was about half empty inside with another two tables occupied in the enclosed biergarten. The host approached us immediately (there is no host stand) and offered us a booth in the front corner. He returned momentarily with menus and utensils.  A couple of minutes later, he approached the table behind and across from us and asked if they had placed drink orders yet. They said no and he apologized, and proceeded to act as their waiter for the whole meal.  At this point, things started going downhill. We waited ten minutes for our waitress to arrive for the first time. She brusquely came up, seeming to be in a rush, and her opening line was \"what can I get you to eat, drink, whatever?\" It might have been funny if we hadn't been sitting there for ten minutes already. We placed drink (two waters), appetizer (potato pancakes) and meal (two \"Weiner Art\" [pork] schnitzels, one with fries and spaetzle, and the other with double spaetzle) orders.  Seven more minutes passed before we saw our waitress again, at which point we finally got our waters, bread and plates for the appetizer. That showed up a few minutes later. It was very hot and had clearly just finished cooking.  About 15 minutes later the meal arrived. Again, the waitress had not been to our table since dropping off the appetizer. She noted our water glasses were now empty and said she would be right back with more. After waiting ten minutes, the entirety of which my partner (who was facing into the restaurant) watched her stand conversing at the same table, she came back and apologized, saying that she had gotten caught up in conversation and felt bad since we were sitting over here parched. She asked if we were really thirsty and if so would leave the pitcher. I said yes just to make sure we had more water. She said ok, but very oddly like I had offended her with my simple answer.  She then immediately returned to the same table she had been gabbing at while we finished and then waited for her to return so we could have our check and get out of there. The other table finally left and she came back over. My partner wasn't feeling well and hadn't eaten a lot of his meal (unrelated to the food, which he really liked) and the waitress said \"Oh, were you just not hungry, or...?\" He said \"yes\" but said it in such a way it could have sounded like \"yeah, that's it\" sarcastically. So, finally showing some waitressing skills, she followed up with \"Was it really that you weren't hungry or was something wrong?\" At this point I jumped in to get her moving and told her that he wasn't feeling well. She said \"Oh. I'm sorry\" and abruptly walked away. The tone was just very odd.  Our check came and though the credit card was already out of the wallet, she somehow managed to walk away before I put it in the folder. I set it up so she would hopefully see it and she returned within about a minute and said \"How did you know to do that?\" I kind of shrugged and didn't really answer and she said \"Less than 1% of people know that. It shows you've been out to eat before. That's a good sign for a waitress.\" I was thinking to myself, it's going to be bad for you once I give you your tip.  I ended up leaving two pennies. She improved a tiny bit around the time of the check but overall the service was just bad. The host, taking care of the table behind and across from us, and the waiter servicing the table across from us were at their respective tables at least two to three times as often as we saw our waitress.  In contrast to some of the other lower-star reviews, this is not about the food, which was delicious and plentiful as always. Pricing is more than fair for the volume of food given. Hopefully next time the service will be on par with the food."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the Schnitzel Haus but was left disappointed. I was married to a German, have traveled all over Germany, have had German food across the US, so my expectations are high.  We started with the kartoffel pancakes, and they were delayed coming out. The cakes were huge, but oil oozed from them when slicing into them. Served with a small portion of canned applesauce and sour cream. I didn't care to eat more than one.  I ordered the jaeger schnitzel and while the cutlet was moist and had a good crust, it was also oozing oil. The jaeger sauce was bland without any punch. I would've thought the mashed potatoes were flakes until I hit a chunk of potato, so that's good, I suppose. I really love spaetzle and this was not my favorite. It needed to be fried in the pan more (to give a better crunchy texture), or it needed to be drizzled into the water at a smaller density. Instead, you just had large, chewy, flavorless curds. Normally spaetzle is the first thing to leave my plate, but I wasn't interested in finishing.  My wife had the seafood alfredo pasta and it was equally unimpressive. The sauce seemed to be nothing more than cream and a bit of parmesan and was one-note (I know, alfredo isn't much more than that, but this was pretty uninteresting). The shrimp was overcooked and the \"krab\" was imitation...so both items were rubbery.   I just got the sense that perhaps the food has been \"Americanized\" to fit the midwest palate."}
{"text":"First visit to Das Schnitzel Haus was a positive one.    We called an hour ahead and asked if we could have a table at 7pm.  The young lady who answered the phone seemed a bit unsure if she could get a table for us, but we overheard a man tell her to tell us all would be fine.  Parking is a premium.  The lot was completely full so we parked two doors over (at our own risk, signs everywhere about private parking, etc.. but the building there was closed so we chanced it).   When we walked in there was no hostess stand, no sign or direction as to tell you where to go.  This was a mild put-off.  A German grandmotherly-type woman came up to us and we explained we had called ahead.  All was good, but it'd be a little wait (which was fine because we got there quite early).   We perched at a tiny two-top at the bar and waited. It was close to 20 after 7pm when she took us to our table. The service here is a bit...  inconsistent, but not what I'd call bad.  It took some time for our initial table greet to come.  In fact, we had time to review the entire menu and make our selections.  The server came and asked if we knew what we'd like to drink.  She was not in the least irritated that we wanted to place our entire order.  After she left, no less than three different people came and asked if we'd been helped.  Odd.   After another moderately lengthy wait, the grandmotherly-lady came to our table and asked what we ordered.  Uh-Oh.  No worries, though.  Our food was ready, actually and it came 20 seconds after that.  Potato pancakes and pierogi.    You know that scene in Ratatouille when restaurant critic Anton Ego takes his first bite and has an ethereal flashback?   That totally happened.   Potato pancakes.  1981.  Mainz, Germany.  I was 5 years old.  Oh.  My.  God.    Everything was prepared with care.  The pierogi were good, but you can get those anywhere in Cleveland.  I had the pork schnitzel and my girl had the jager schnitzel (served with mushroom gravy).  They were especially crispy and delicious... and huge.  We're both used to a particular recipe of German potato salad- from the German ladies of Tennessee- and this potato salad was not exactly our favorite.  It was prepared well, but for us wasn't quite right for us.  Just a preference thing; I'm sure.  The cabbage was very good, though.  Next time I think I'll try a different set of sides with my meal; because folks, there's going to be a next time.  Oh yes, there will be a next time.    Das Schnitzel Haus really could use some work in the organization of their customer service, but they were all very friendly.  We enjoyed our visit and personally, I can't wait to go back for more potato pancakes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic German food cooked without pretense you can't go wrong with Das Schnitzel Haus. Here, it's all about the food. Lots and lots of hearty, traditional Franconian fare in all its slightly monochromatic beige to orange to brown deliciousness.  We paid them a visit on a recent Saturday evening around 6:30 and it looked like they were just getting into their prime time. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a smiling hostess. She led us through the main dining area which was packed with a table of 10 or so people who were clearly enjoying themselves toward the rear of the restaurant and into a smaller back room.  I've got to mention the atmosphere quickly before I move on. Not meant to be deprecating in any way, it reminded me a bit of eating in the basement of someone's grandma's house. It was neat and clean just oddly disjointed and bit haphazard - different sized tables, steins lining the rafters, starving artist-type sofa-sized oil paintings. There were even string lights hanging on the walls, probably a holiday thing. My simple guidance is to avoid judging the place by the decor.  The food is the main reason to come here and if you aren't interested in German food, go somewhere else. Sure, their menu has some non-German offerings like BBQ ribs, chicken parmesan, and a reuben sandwich, I would just rather get those types of dishes from a restaurant that specializes in them. If your ass is in a DSH seat you should be eating at least one of the following:  Schnitzel kraut Keuglen Wurst  We steeled ourselves against the oncoming carb onslaught. It was gonna be a big one. Our meal started with two of my favorite things on the planet, fresh-made, crusty warm bread and German beer. The bread tasted like it was made in an old-timey stone oven and the beer, my God the beer, was amazing. Hofbrau Dunkel and  Franziskaner Weissbier on tap. There's just no understating the brilliance of pairing real German beer with German food. Speaking of the food, here's how our meal went:  Kartoffel Kueglen - (4) potato pancakes served with containers of apple sauce and sour cream. Tasty, crispy and golden albeit a tad heavy-handed with the black pepper.  Wurst Platte - A bratwurst and a knockwurst served with two sides. I opted for the spatzle and German potato salad. When it comes to the tubed meats other nationalities got nothin on the Germans. The sausages were delicious, spicy and juicy. The spatzle was doughy and buttery and the potato salad had just the right combination of sweet and sour.  KÃ¤se Schnitzel - The chicken variety of the German pounded meat classic. Breaded and pan fried a crispy golden brown before being covered in a layer of ooey-gooey melted provolone cheese. My wife opted for sides of mashed potatoes and gravy and red cabbage. The cabbage slaw added some much needed acid to this gut-bomb of a dish and the potatoes were smooth and creamy.  Apple Strudel - This was the only culinary disappointment we experienced during our visit. Puff pastry filled with apples and dusted with powdered sugar. A ho-hum rendition, it was dry and barely warm. It needed a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead of an orange slice.  A brief mention on the service. Our server was very friendly and did see to our every need. Mainly, beers were refilled as were waters. My only issue was with the length of time it took between visits. While not painfully long (the beer did help) there were some noticeable wait times between courses. Don't expect fast food, just have another beer and enjoy yourself.  We walked out of Das Schnitzel Haus smiling and holding our distended bellies. Having just ingested more than a week's worth of carbohydrates and a multitude of hand-crafted German beers it was to be expected. Sure, the decor is a bit corny and the service a tad long in the tooth, but we didn't care much. Like I said. Here, it's all about the food. Make sure to come with an empty stomach.  P.S. There's a massive wooden patio with its own fireplace attached to the side of the main building. I've got a feeling we'll be back sometime when the weather's more bier garten friendly."}
{"text":"Great little cozy spot with good german beers and great eastern european food. Very Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Holy Schnitzel! The first bite took me right back to Germany when I last visited in 2014, now I want to go back. Curry-wurst was a big thing back then and I thought I'd never taste it again, but they have it here as an appetizer.  Other than Das Schnitzel, I'd recommend Das Sausage Platter, Das Spaetzle and Das Sauerkraut. Let me talk about this sauerkraut for a minute, it was not too sour, it was fresh, and had that homemade flavor -- very friendly to the palate. I mixed it with the spaetzle. This says a lot because I typically do not like sauerkraut, because the mass-produced ones tend to taste a bit too acidic and stale -- not this one. Sehr gut!  I thought I saw a Crispy Pork Hock in the menu. Ich komme wieder!"}
{"text":"Friday night my friends and I went to the schnitzel haus. The home cook food was so tasty. I had the jager schnitzel and a dunkle. Our server kaytee was very attentive and sweet. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful setting for delicious European cuisine. I had the Wurst Platte with sour krout and spaetzle.  Great flavor. Others had the chicken paprikash which was very good as well.  For dessert we tried both the apple and cherry strudel.  Both fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place when on the near west side"}
{"text":"Authentic German/Polish food, old school taste and decor.  A coworker and I were craving po' boy sandwiches and this placed popped in search for po' boys. The decor was authentic and the place was filled with cool signs and paintings.   After showing up and checking out the great specials, I actually decided on some other dishes. I went with the sauerkraut and several sausage like dishes. It was awesome. My friend got the po' boy and loved it though. It wasn't anything spectacular but the tastes were pure and authentic and that's exactly what we were looking for.  Swing by the Schnitzel Haus and try the specials, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"really good restaurant , they have good cakes too- especially black forest"}
{"text":"Ok so now since I've ate an actual meal from here I can give a better review. Which is exactly what this place deserves! The food is absolutely delicious!! I had the deutsche platte. The veal was amazing, the bratwurst was delicious and instead of goulash I opted for mashed potatoes and gravy, and yes, they were good! Sauerkraut was tasty and the spatzels were ok. The spatzels were maybe a little on the dry/tough side.   My friend had the wurst platte and it was very good too!! Bratwurst, knockwurst and semi-spicy Hungarian sausage that was unlike any sausage I've had! It's smoked and it tastes like your inhaling the smoke, but in a good way!!  Cabbage and noodles were tasty as well.   We had a few beers which I don't think I need to comment on, except for the Special Rauchbier. We picked two random beers to try and that was one of them. The beer tastes as smoky as the sausage! Definitely different but not too bad. If you're up for giving your tastebuds an adventure with beer, go for the Special Rauchbier!  If you're in the mood for some delicious German food I would highly recommend Das Schnitzel Haus!"}
{"text":"I always get the sausage platter with warm potato salad, kraut and spaetzle. I have tried the schnitzel and it is very tasty. The staff is super friendly and it seems like the bar is always crowded. My only complain is that they close the kitchen early on weeknights which is a bummer. I usually call ahead for take-out and they're very fast. I wish they had more sandwiches."}
{"text":"Come hungry.  Large portions that 'stick to the ribs'. Authentic taste and prompt service with a smile. Reminds me of my travels through Europe. My only complaint is that there's no place to take a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"This place has the best German Food ever! Portions are large, prices are reasonable and the food is heavenly! The service was excellent. My husband had brats and I had schnitzel with spaetzle. My schnitzel was cooked perfectly. I wish we lived in Ohio, because we would make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Holy schnitzel--I wasn't expecting this place to be this good!   Is it gourmet? No. It's Eastern European, homey goodness in your tummy. Just about the only thing that knocked the 5th star off were the lack-luster service (not bad, just not great) and the side salad was bagged iceberg salad. Other than that--this place is crazy good.   First, the potato pancakes. Okay--this gal grew up with some crazy good (and crazy weird) Jewish and Hungarian food. These potato pancakes were out of this world good. Think more along the lines of mashed potato and onion patties fried up perfectly crispy, golden brown rather than shredded taters.   The side salad was \"meh\" but the bread they served was warm, rustic and crunchy on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside. It tasted homemade, although I can't confirm.   And then, the rubin happened. Holy mother of corned beef. Like I said, I have some pretty hefty experience in this realm and I can't tell you I've had better corned beef than this. It tasted completely homemade, tender, the perfect brine and a dark crust on the outside. I could have skipped the bread, cheese and kraut--this beef was the star.   Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, excellent food, great beer.  The home baked bread is addicting.   Love their daily specials.   Staff is the best around.   Try their clam bakes on Friday or Saturday and you will not go anywhere else.    LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"The food was completely bland.  Her pierogis tasted like they just came out of the freezer and my Cajun chicken fettucine tasted as if it was microwaved.  The cheese in her French onion soup wasn't melted- 3 pieces stacked on one another.  The order was incorrect and after having to wait for an exorbitant period of time, we went home and noticed we were missing an item.  After going back to get the item I was never met with an apology and instead of bagging the item to keep it warm, the server just handed me the container.  Think twice before dining here.  The food doesn't justify the prices and the service is lackluster at best."}
{"text":"Had always wanted to try this place!  Delicious food but don't be in a hurry it did take a a while to get our appetizers and main meal."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here this evening.  It was busy & we decided to eat at the bar.  I ordered the Rinderrouladen, German potato salad, & purple cabbage. My husband had the Chicken Paprikash.  The food was absolutely delicious & authentic German!! Cannot wait to back !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Would love to see them put the crab cakes on the menu as an appetizer and not just a special. They were marvelous!! So we're the sauerkraut balls! Nostrovia!"}
{"text":"Where have all the Germans migrated in Cleveland?  I expected such an ethnic city to be brimming with brats and beer, sauerbraten, and kraut.  After an extensive search of places only open a couple of days a week, or over the weekend, I stumbled on Das Schnitzel Haus in Parma.  The restaurant looks like a 60's rambler ranch with a wood deck as large as the house perched on the front.  Lots of outdoor seating and probably a great place for beer drinking during the warmer months. The deck also has a couple of televisions for sports viewing.  The front dining room is the only dining room I've been in - but i believe they have an additional dining room.  It's a cozy place - not huge, but accomodating enough.  Good German food is the plllar of the menu - ribs with kraut, veal schnitzel, goulash, sauerbraten, cabbage rolls, Bratwurst, schnitzel sandwiches, and side dishes like German potato salad, red cabbage, spaetzel, cabbage and noodles,and cooked kraut, to name a few.  The kalb schnitzel is my favorite - an ample portion of tender veal, pan fried, with choice of sides - I usually chose kraut and red cabbage and an extra sde of spaetzel.  Th red cabbage is homemade and not overly sweet, and has a nice crunch.  The kraut hasn't been boiled to death and has a great sour flavor.  The spaetzel is likely from a box, but tastes fine mixed with the kraut and cabbage.  The pork and spare ribs are also excellent - the meat falls off the bones - just like eating New Year's Dinner. The cabbage rolls are also great.  There is also a sampler platter featuring a smaller pice of schnitzel, some goulash, and a bratwurst.    There is plenty of cold beer available.  Service has been spotty - uneven drink refills and sometimes some issues with coordinating food delivery.  The bread served with your meal is pretty uninspired as well - from the wrapper to your table so to speak.  It's not a huge problem, but probably the one thing the restaurant needs to work on.  The place is also small enough that your server can't disappear....  Desserts are so so  - they vary everyday - so really it's a matter of luck what you'll get to chose from.  I've had the apple strudel and unfortunately my piece had been in the cooler a couple of days too long.  But hey - have a second beer instead of dessert!  The portions are ample so that you won't feel like having dessert anyways.   The food is excellent - and worth a try if you like German cooking."}
{"text":"Delicious German and Eastern European food! Get the cabbage rolls! They are delicious."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOAH! If you are looking for authentic German/Hungarian cuisine, this is definitely the place. As you walk in, you feel like your stepping into another country! The ambiance is wooden with plenty of table and booths as well as an outside area in the front of the restaurant. We came in after the dinner crowd, around 8pm and had phenomenal service.   We ordered the stuff cabbage and side of mashed potatoes and cabbage and noodles. Unfortunately, the cook/owner came out and said she only had 1 stuffed cabbage left and we can add anything else so we got the gulosh (spatzels and pot roast). This was by far THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD compared to grandmas. The bead provided was also delicious and fresh out of the oven. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes as well as the homemade desserts."}
{"text":"Love the Food! Our family is part German, so I've been in search of some good German food, thats close to home. I've found it at Das Schnitzel Haus. My fav is the Jaeger Schnitzel and their warm German potato salad, YUUMMM. I was only disappointed once when ordering a beer, they were all out.  Wait staff is always friendly and helpful. Cant wait to sit on the heated patio once the weather is a little warmer!"}
{"text":"Party of Two:  food was good as always - had a huge party in the restaurant and our service was slow - but that was to be expected.  Waiter did not offer soup or salad to my husband - and ALL DINNERS COME WITH ONE OR THE OTHER.  I wanted to say something but my husband asked me not too.  Specials on the chalk board with full menu being offered also.  Raspberry was was way way WAY too strong...."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great service. Awesome food. Needs to have a beer menu. They have great selection of german beers but list was recited but waiter."}
{"text":"As a good German girl who grew up on grandma's Wiener Schnitzel and German potato salad I have to say this place is spot on! My meal was perfect...right down to the red cabbage! Thank you for taking me back to my childhood! Sehr gut!!"}
{"text":"Gave it another try and, again, the food was delicious.  The service this time was excellent.  Glad our first visit was (hopefully) a fluke.  Was happy I gave it another try."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, everything we got was delicious. Schnitzel, cabbage and noodles, and speatzle are the best. They use to have crappy service, but today's service was perfect. Also, wonderful selection of German bier on tap."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with friends tonight. It was very crowed. We had a 55 minute wait. The hostess kept us informed on the wait. I ordered the bar b q ribs with mild sauce and fries. To me the ribs were perfect. Fall off the bone and very tasty. The fries were hot and very good. My husband had the deutsch platte and enjoyed it tho he said the goulash was chewy not as tender as he likes. The sausage was great as was the red cabbage and German potatoes.  Pros: large portions of good food. And the food was hot. Attentive hostess who even thanked us for coming in and apologized for the long wait. Cons: very noisy, server not as attentive because it was very busy."}
{"text":"Warning their menu is not the same online as it is in the resteraunt, service was not good, and it was 37 dollars and something for 2 meals and a coffee and that didn't include our tip! Food was good and portions were large but we filled up on so much of the bread before we actually got the meal. Also there was a table in front of us getting  samples of food and different items that were not listed on the menu, that kinda irked me."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  Truly authentic.  Portions are extremely large.  I frequent many German restaurants, and this is a good one.  The staff is awesome.    Recommend the Jager Schnitzel (almost for 2)."}
{"text":"We've lived around the corner from here for years and we've never been! Came tonight. It was either over crowded or under staffed. The place was packed!! We finally sat on the patio -- thank God it was heated!   My husband had the Wurt Platta and it was delicious. His aides were german potato salad and red cabbage. All great.   I had chicken paprikash. The spaetzels were good but the chicken was dry and the sauce was runny m  Bread was great and my husband enjoyed his beer!"}
{"text":"Very nice venue! And such a friendly server, Danielle. She was eager to help us with any questions we had about the menu. The online menu is, unfortunately, not complete. There are many more items on the menu in the restaurant. Seems to me they should update to attract more people with a complete menu. That's why I can't tell you the exact name of what I had! I had a veal schnitzel. With it I had sauerkraut and home fries. All were quite good. Veal can be terrible quality so I am very cautious ordering it at a restaurant. This piece was very thin and tender and delicious, just like it should be! The sides were good as well. My wife had their version of fish & chips, not listed on the menu that way but the description was clear. Very good also but one of the two pieces was a bit overcooked. Overall, well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Not the best German place I've eaten at but it wasn't terrible either. I probably won't go back though. Just wasn't worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Excellant!  Hot fresh food! The bread was also served warm!  The schnitzel was fried to perfection.  Authentic German food and also other dishes.  My waiter was very attentive.  Good size portions. Looking forward to going back in a couple of weeks with some of my lady friends."}
{"text":"really enjoyed my meal there... sometimes ya just gotta have some schnitzel. It was pretty loud with children (not a fan ;) ... I'd suggest going after 7:30 if you want to be able to talk. Great food, good beer!"}
{"text":"The wife had the roasted duck and I had the Rueben schnitzel. Both were very good and perfectly cooked. The portions were very large and we had to get to go boxes. The perogies were perfect too."}
{"text":"Great authentic German food and atmosphere. Server was excellent and very attentive. Can get crowded, so call ahead. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and server were absolutely amazing. The management on the other hand was regretfully dreadful. Despite our server's best efforts and unparalleled hard work, he was clearly left to fail by his management staff. Short staffing and this type of poor behavior is negligent to each and every staff member."}
{"text":"gave up on dine in service months ago because lack of service.  to-go  had been adequate but my experience today has me looking for a new German restaurant.  2 sides and bread missing. the food kept me coming back for over 5 yrs now but with the consistent lack of any service (dine-in, or carry-out) just not worth it anymore not for $$$$$ prices."}
{"text":"I really debated how many stars to rate Das Schnitzel Haus. The food was really good, which surprised me. I don't eat red meat or pork, and have never been a huge fan of traditional German Food. However, it was a good friend's birthday, and this was the birthday girl's choice (she was pretty set on getting piergoies). A group of us headed there on a Friday evening. I was a little unsure of her choice when I walked in and the majority of customers appeared to be of the retired age set.   They have a pretty good menu. You may have a problem finding something that is tasty if you are vegan or vegetarian. There was more on the menu here that I would eat than at Fathead's, for the record (although I would be more than happy to just beer it up at Fathead's) - and both have wings on their menu. There's even a small portion of the menu dedicated to kids (although I remember stuff like chicken fingers on it).   I had the Kase Schnitzel with spaetzel and mashed potatoes with gravy, and a \"gringer ale\" (their spelling) to drink. Everyone's portions seemed rather large, which is not a complaint at all. Also, everyone enjoyed their food. We were having some amazing conversation, but you know that the food is tasty when there are several times when their was silence. I easily took home half of my meal. The mashed potatoes and gravy were the least tasty portion, and they were still pretty good. My gravy came with two small pieces of meat. The spaetzel is buttery, and paired well with my chicken. While my meal wasn't what anyone would regard as healthy, it was SO GOOD. Mmmmm. I'm debating heating up that bad boy right now and having a snack (err.... meal) before bed.   They let us bring our own dessert, and even stored it in their fridge while we happily enjoyed our meal. I only note this because another restaurant recently refused to let us bring our own dessert to a friend's birthday dinner. I get that places would like to sell their own food rather than cake from somewhere else (in our defense, both birthday ladies had desired a specific dessert).   My only complaints were that there wasn't a beer list (so I actually didn't even know that they had beer til the end of my meal when someone at another table ordered one) and an issue with the server. Our server was actually really good... but was trying to take care of us (and whatever other tables he had) along with a 48 person party up front. I'm not really sure why the restaurant decided it was a good choice to have 2 servers taking care of a 48 person rehearsal dinner, as well as their own tables. My friend ordered a salad with her food, which she never got (but they also didn't charge her for it). Luckily the portions are huge, so she wasn't too bothered by the missing salad. We may have tried to get it had we been able to find our waiter (or any waiter). I was ready for a box, and had finished both of my beverages while waiting for the waiter to check on us. When we had him stop back, he was always apologetic - but why wasn't someone else helping out a little more?"}
{"text":"Wow, the pork schnitzel was delicious. I was worried at first about the kraut because it had caraway seeds. But I didn't need to worry,  the kraut was phenomenal.  My husband had the smoked sausage and he loved it. We live about 40 minutes away, but we will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Euro! Phenomenal food. Service was just ok, but they were slammed on a Friday night and they were really friendly. Had the JagrSchnitzel, wife had Saurbraten, my Mother had some kind of Pork Hock dish, everything was excellent. Even the bread was homemade and reminded me of my Grandmother's.  Had a very simple chicken dumpling soup that I could have drank by the gallon, so good. I will be back.......often!!!"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of schnitzel. Veal, pork, chicken, beef . . . I felt like it was missing items or was let down in some areas. The German potato salad was seasoned slices potatoes . . . I've had German potato salad, I guess I just don't appreciate this version of it. The schnitzel wasn't as tender as it could have been in my opinion either. The spÃ¤tzle was decent enough. You find some interesting options for foreign beers, they had a personal favorite of mine, a dark dunkle. They of course also carry a Hefeweizen. The servers seemed friendly, and they have a patio, but it was regrettably still tied closed no fresh breeze for us.   My over all feeling after I left was that it was more expensive than it should have been and, while hunger satisfied, I just felt underwhelmed for some reason."}
{"text":"I don't have much experience with German style food. But my girlfriend is from the area - and while I was visiting Cleveland for work - she wanted me to try Pierogies!   I opted to sit at the bar in the rear of the restaurant. I ordered two kinds of Pierogies - plus a main course - Jaegar Schnitzel - also something I've never had! And paired up with a mug of a German beer.  The Pierogies - were well, like dumplings. They were interesting and tasty!  The Jaeger Schnitzel was thin, tender, and crispy! Served with a very tasty, savory mushroom gravy, and sides of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and gravy. Very good, heavy, and filling.  The staff was very friendly. Service was excellent!  #DasSchnitzelHaus"}
{"text":"I have been passing this place everyday for years now. We finally went in and I wish I could say I was impressed, but I can't. The food was very salty. From the bread to the main course someone went crazy on the salt. The server was good but it takes a very long time to get your food. It was more than 30 minutes from the time we ordered until the food arrived. We didn't get anything fancy or complicated. Chicken wings, french fries and stuffed cabbage. The stuffed cabbage was way too salty. So if you have patience and like salt this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite decent and has all your traditional Eastern European favorites.  I really dug their turkey schnitzel as well.  Great beer selection and yummy desserts like their streudel.  Service can be slow at times, but are friendly.  I do think it's a good establishment and will be back!"}
{"text":"The portions are HUGE! If you like real German food this place is a must! The patio is awesome too!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 for a first time visit at this restaurant.. It was very crowded at 5:30 pm. and the parking lot was almost filled up.  After leaving our name with the hostess, we waited in the attached enclosed heated patio room. While waiting a waiter brought us some hot crusty sour dough bread and butter to munch on...a very nice touch!  An hour later we were seated.  Our friends had the Kase Spatzle with side of noodles and cabbage and the special tonight, veal paprikash.  Both were very tasty, tho the veal was a bit on the chewy side.  Wife and I had the ribs and Deutsch Platte.  Wife really enjoyed the ribs, very tender with a mild bbq sauce. I enjoyed the D-Platte, The bratwurst and schnitzel were great as were the sides. The goulash could have been more tender tho. Unfortunately, after such great meals we were disappointed with the desserts; the cherry strudel was over done and dry and the crepes were under done and doughy.   Pros: Large serving sizes of good, home made comfort food. Nice mugs of cold beers at reasonable prices. Friendly server that took time to answer our questions. The hostess even came over to the table and thanked us for coming to the restaurant and apologized for the long wait time.   Cons: Very noisy, but only because of all the people there tonight. Desserts were a disappointment. A very popular place for good German style food. We will be back (but we'll get there earlier on a Saturday next time.)"}
{"text":"Excellent real german food and beer There was sooo much in the serving. Potato pancakes were great. People were friendly. They KNEW when I ordered mayo with my fries that I had been in German or lived there.  Portions were WAY hugh - go hungry.   from my Droid X Daymond"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience here. As long as you're in the mood for German food you can't go wrong. There service has been wonderful as well"}
{"text":"As a web developer I must say that my favorite part about this place might be their online presence - they have an impressively functional and well-designed website.  The service was okay.  I have a tendency to get the same foods over and over, so I tried to break that by getting a pork schnitzel sandwich (afterall, this is a SCHNITZEL house, and if anything, it's really fun to say).  It was HUGE!  The food was satisfactory - I think I'd like to come back in the summer sometime because they have something of an indoor patio that was lit up with string lighting.  It looked like an area to have a relaxing time with some drinks and good friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious bread. Had the German meatballs - something different. They were tasty. I was going to order schnitzel but I saw it at other tables and it looked too dark - either over-cooked or old oil. That's judging by sight only.  Their spaetzle looked store (SYSCO) bought. I like larger, home-made spaetzle.  Brewed tea. Friendly service. Pretty fast."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Best pierogies I have ever had! There is a little bit of a wait but it is well worth it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always eat here when I am in the area.  Just great food and old school atmosphere.  Get the Kraut balls!"}
{"text":"I am hard pressed to give this place any stars at all!    I have been here several times and find the food awful.  These folks are Croatian and Serbian... yet their Cevapcici is the worst I have ever had.  I ordered this on the special bread called lepina.  What I got was bread covered with some sort of lard or grease.  They should be ashamed.    A friend of mine had dinner there on the night they had music, he ate dinner and had several drinks... when the music started they asked him to pay a cover charge, even though he was already there... tacky to say the least.  I had posted this info months ago but it seemed to have disappeared."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 1-31-16 with four others and we all selected  our choices. The server was warm and friendly despite the place being very busy. We all loved our meals. The food was served hot, very tasty, ample quantity, and plated beautifully. Love the place and will certainly return. The owner/cook greeted us after we had eaten and asked how we enjoyed our meals. Very nice touch."}
{"text":"I love German food, so I was super pumped to eat at Das Schnitzel house. We had a big group with us and I'll say that the service was excellent!  We started with a few appetizers - stuffed peppers, sauerkraut balls, and potato pancakes. They were all pretty good. The sauerkraut balls were just ok, but we all really enjoyed the stuffed peppers and potato pancakes.  I was really excited for the chicken paprikash, but it was super watery and not at all how I've had it at other german restaurants in the past. It was bland and came out lukewarm, and the chicken was absolutely flavorless.  The holsteiner schnitzel (which is topped with 2 sunny side-up eggs) was  an improvement, as the breading was flavored nicely. The apple strudel was enjoyable, as it was not too sweet. Over all, I thought everything was just ok, especially compared to price."}
{"text":"I love German sausage, the beer and the perfect baked bread here. The waitress is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. The service may be a little bit slow. We came for lunch so it was ok for us. I 'd like to come again."}
{"text":"This was an incredible experience. The food and beer took me straight back to my trip to Germany. The food was delicious and authentic, and the service was fantastic! Definitely worth a trip out of your way."}
{"text":"How could anyone say no to pork hocks?!! The meat tastes like it came right out of a spit!  I haven't had pork that great since I visited a Dominican restaurant in NY. And the home made bread from scratch?!!! Wow blown away by the attention to detail on EVERY dish the chefs put out. The liver dumpling soul was phenomenal!  Was a cross between pate and meatballs. Even my husband (who isn't a fan of liver) loved it. Vinny was an outstanding server. Very honest about his recommendations, attentive and prompt. The beer list is decent as well and must try the German liquors too. I would love to see some more German beers and liquors please."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great German beer selection, and a bier garten, what more could you ask for?!  With great service, friendly staff, and an amazing menu with huge portions - this place is a great location for an Eastern European style dinner or heavy lunch."}
{"text":"We went here for a family members birthday. The food was not my thing, but that was not the reason that I won't be going back.  I was pretty convinced that the waitress was drunk."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this authentic German restaurant! There were 8 of us and everything was delicious. Food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Great food and beer that pairs. Restaurant serves up the most authentic German dishes and even though the price is on the higher side, the taste justifies. I've been here many times for the view schnitzel and I can guarantee I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Shared the sausage appetizer - OMG was it good! We had a table of 10 so we passed some food around. I ordered the Hungarian goulash - super tasty! Cabbage & noodles - yum!!! Tried the stuffed cabbage - good. Red cabbage - yum!!! Sour cream cucumbers / also good. And the lemonade Riesling vodka spritzer was amazing!!! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Was excited to find a German restaurant during my business trip to Cleveland. On a Wednesday night, the place was busy; being alone, I decided to sit at the bar. My waiter, while pleasant, apparently had too much going on so he wasn't able to be as attentive as I'd like. (There was no dedicated bartender) I ordered the Bavarian pretzel..what came out was a lump of bread that was shriveled up as if it had been microwaved. It tasted liked it looked, so i sent it back. Next was my Wiener Schnitzel. Huge portion, and I ordered the potatoes and spaetzle with it. Unfortunately, the potatoes were lukewarm and the spaetzle was cold. I sent the spaetzle back and 10 minutes later I had a bowl of small lumps of tasteless flour balls...very disappointing. They should have an egg noodle taste, usually sauteed in butter. Maybe I hit a bad night, as there are many great reviews here. Maybe I should have sat at a table to be served better.  As a side observation, at many restaurants I have visited lately, including this one, the staff seem unaware that diners would enjoy a pleasant QUIET dining experience. Staff is always talking at each other in loud voices, about things that have nothing to do with the business at hand. I'm not singling out this place; but managers should make their folks more aware of maintaining the decorum when out in the dining room, as well as in the kitchen"}
{"text":"long wait, took our order of corned beef, brought the dressing for it out to the table with our dirnks and 45 minutes later no food... now we hear no corned beef... should they have not told us right away...we went somewhere else for the corned beef... good bye."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the food and beer here.  I keep going back.  It's right around the corner from my house!  We weren't sure where to meet my folks for dinner, so they pulled in the parking lot and asked us to meet them at Das Schnitzel Haus (again).  I ordered my favorite Wiener Schnitzel with mushrooms, sauerkraut, and red cabbage.  We had the same ultra-smiley-friendly waitress as last time and she even remembered us.  I tried a special imported German beer that she simply called \"dunkel\" or dark, but she did not say what kind it was.  It was an unfiltered beer that might have been of the Wit (wheat) variety.  Anyway, I loved my big beer.   The meal and service were excellent, yet again.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with Saurkraut balls. I had the veal sandwich and it was delicious. I also had the seafood salad as a starter and the shrimp was very fresh. The house warsteiner was delicious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I come here we have a fantastic meal and Saturday night was no exception. We were unsure of what the crowd would be like for New Year's Eve but it wasn't too bad and we were able to be seated immediately at the bar. The service has always been great, the family who owns it are extremely nice and very accommodating. I had the special which was the Veal Oscar Schnitzel. A Schnitzel topped with Hollandaise and crab meat. My husband had the Italian Schnitzel. Everything was perfect, all the way down to the kraut and spaetzels. The portions are huge so be prepared to take a box home! I was surprised to see some of the bad reviews until I read them. First off, don't come here and order something like ribs or wings. While I am sure they are delicious, the point is that it's an authentic German restaurant. Any of the schnitzel dishes are amazing."}
{"text":"Party of 7 for a birthday celebration. For my wife and I, it was our first time. The place is old. Might have even been a house years ago. Anyway, my wife and I are no strangers to the Hofbrauhaus chain of restaurants. We love them. Not that we're experts in German cuisine but we enjoy that type of food. Das Schnitzel Haus did not disappoint. I had the pork schnitzel and my wife had the duck. The food was every bit as good as the Hofbrauhaus. Beer was great. My wife loved the lager and I had the Dunkel. Reservations are encouraged but not mandatory. Seemed to have ample parking but it wasn't busy when we went. We came away fans and will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing portions.  Very authentic. We went on a weeknight for a fun dinner and the place was bumpin' with some fellow schnitzel lovers.    We each tried a different variation of the lovable pounded pork, each with different sides.  You really couldn't go wrong with any of them.  And for dessert we had a couple of different strudels, the cheese was on special and it sure was special.    The Jaegar schnitzel was not my choice, however it will be next time.  Something about adding gravy make is that much more enjoyable.    I'd love to come back in the summer and see what that beautiful patio is about.  It's a very scenic part of Pearl Rd."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5-stars if the choice of German beers had been deeper, but overall this place was great.  Four of my colleagues and I had a variety of schnitzel dishes and everyone was extremely satisfied.  We even had a vegetarian who had an eggplant dish who thought it was great.   The server was attentive and very friendly, even voluntarily bringing out samples of some of the sides for members of our party who were unfamiliar with typical German dishes.   The place was very busy, but they didn't miss a beat.  I've been to Germany many times for work and I'd say this stacked up with anything I ate there.    Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I desperately want to give this visit a 5 star, but we were seated in the covered patio area this time, and I literally feel sick. I may call city hall tomorrow and ask them to check out this room. It was literally 90Â° with no air movement. We asked many, many times for them to turn off the fireace, or at least open a damned window.  The good was good, but the experience was miserable. The only one in our party who was comfortable was my 88 yr old father who is always cold."}
{"text":"We happened to be in Parma, and found this in Yelp.  I'm half German, and enjoy having a good ethnic meal now and then.  The place was quite busy at 6pm on a cold Tuesday night.  We were seated right away.    Good was delicious, huge portions.   But SLOW service. Painfully slow.   Everyone was very friendly. Not sure if they were short staffed."}
{"text":"Carb Party!!  This place is awesome! I love the atmosphere - it's so cozy and warm.   I can say, in the absence of hyperbole, that the warm, crusty bread with butter they served before our entrees was literally the best thing I've ever tasted.   Save room for dessert! We shared a slice of Black Forest Cake, and we both contracted diabetes on the spot, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"We came here right during the dinner rush on a Saturday night. We didn't think it was going to be that busy, but we were wrong. The hostess was running around frantically seating people, serving food and taking peoples' names. We waited about 40 mins to finally be seated. The server was nice and I got the jaeger schnitzel, which has mushroom gravy on top. All schnitzels come with two sides of your choice so I chose red cabbage and spÃ¤tzle. The red cabbage was pretty delicious and although I've never had spÃ¤tzle before, it was buttery and similar to pasta. Although the schnitzel was good, it was salty and pretty heavy. I couldn't finish both pieces on my plate.   Most people walk out of this place with big takeout containers, so be prepared for the big portions when ordering."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is good the spetzel is tasty the JÃ¤ger schnitzel is fantastic and it's german owner and operated. It makes me very proud and makes me miss my grandmother and reflex on my child hood. This is a very great place to go."}
{"text":"The service was very good. The food was good too but way overpriced. The bread was the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"We thought this place was a lil odd.  German talk radio played.  The food was decent, filling for sure, but a bit more pricey than we were expecting.  Good cabbage n noodles ."}
{"text":"The is a gem of a place that we just happened upon.  The service was friendly.  The food was great, Wiener Schnitzel and Liver and Onions.  There is an extensive list of German beers."}
{"text":"A group of 5 decided to head out to Das Schnitzel Haus last week. We were all very glad we did. The atmosphere is great. It reminds me of this place called Polish Villa 2 in Buffalo. The service was good. We had the back room entirely to ourselves which was pretty special. We all tried each other's schnizels. I have a new street name: Das Schnitzel. Thanks to this place. I ordered the turkey schnitzel. It was huge. Topped with a potato pancake and smothered in cheddar. I had spetzel with gravy as a side. I would not recommend a salad as a side. Definitely the weakest point of the meal. I tried the chicken schnitzel, jager schnitzel and the goulash. Out of the three, the goulash may have been the best. A very tough decision. I can not say enough about the place. It has a nice throwback vibe that I enjoy and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that my Grandmother was German so I am familiar with authentic German food. This was by far the BEST German food I have ever had! The spaetzles were delightful, absolutely done to perfection! I Schnitzel was also perfect. Crisp on the exterior and tender on the inside. The Schnitzel portion was huge, two very large pieces. It could definitely be split between two people. I ended up taking one piece back to our hotel room. My husband ordered the Wurst Platter with potato salad and home fried potatoes.  He said that both the Bratwurst and the Knockwurst were outstanding.  I tried the potato salad and it was delicious, just the perfect temperature and had a nice bacon flavor. Our server Nick S. was attentive and knowledgeable.  He said he had not been there very long but was so versed in the menu items that you would never have known. We had a crepe for dessert that we both shared. Again the portion was very large and we both enjoyed it. The manager came by the table and chatted.  Like everyone else who worked there she was just a sweet as she could be. I would give this place 10 stars if I could.  If I lived in Parma, OH I would eat here several times a week!"}
{"text":"Outstanding German food.  As visitors to the city, we were looking to find a good German restaurant.  We found it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service for years! This is a go to for me if I want comfort food. They haven't let me down once."}
{"text":"Usually, when I eat as much food as I did at this place, I am filled with a looming feeling of regret. All I was filled with after my meal here was happiness....and a lot of beer. It's been two days since visiting Das Schnitzel Haus, and I am still munching on delicious German leftovers.  The building itself is quaint and cottage-like; the inside is definitely welcoming and cozy. The beer list isn't huge, but it's full of some of the best beer you can get locally. I opted for a Hefeweiss, and it was one of the best I've had. My eyes lit up as the server brought out a towering glass of beer with the perfect amount of foam. For just $5, I was expecting a pint. The rest of my party were really happy with their beers as well.   The food itself isn't fancy; it's stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I ordered the pork schnitzel with spatzels and german potato salad. The dish came with two nicely flattened pieces of pork that were about the size of my head each. The spatzels were light and buttery, and the german potato salad had the perfect balance of tangy and starchy. I did also get to try a bite of the chicken paprikash, and even though I had my own meal to admire, I was wishing I had room for two. The service wasn't top-notch, but it was prompt. The server did forget a few items, but their absence was easily forgotten when we all started biting into the food. Trust me, the food and portions will make up for any errors or delays in service."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  The portions are huge.  Really a comprehensive beer list of Eastern European countries.  We had a kind, competent waiter who was accurate with everyone's order despite it being very busy.  The room is cheery but not upscale...fine with me.  The bread is incredibly wonderful.  Everyone at the table had a schnitzel and all were happy.  (Strange to see it garnished with orange instead of lemon, but there must be a reason for it.)  Next time, I'm going for the potato pancakes as my main dish, they were THAT good."}
{"text":"Traditional German cuisine hasn't established itself in the U.S. like Italian or Chinese has and it's quite a loss for us Americans because I really enjoyed coming here. The price may seem a little high but the entrees will fill you up. I had the stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes and it reminds me every bit of the food my grandmother makes from her recipes. Being a German restaurant, the beer selection is incredible and from all over central and eastern Europe as well (I recommend the Czechvat from Czechia). Definitely am looking forward to coming back and with more friends."}
{"text":"Yes, they have authentic German food here. I dined here many years ago and was not impressed, but I heard they improved so I came back. I ordered the jager schnitzel. It's not exactly like the schnitzel I used to get back in Bavaria but it was a suitable substitute.   I ordered the full dinner portion of the schnitzel for lunch and ate the whole thing no problem. It came with good bread, sauerkraut, and home fries. I also downed a tall glass of very good German weissebier. My wife had the lunch portion of chicken paprikasch which she thoroughly enjoyed. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good...I've been here several times and the food is always great.  Bread is made fresh every day and if you go for lunch it'll come hot and straight from the oven.  I recommend the potato pancakes for an appetizer.  Even though this is a schnitzel haus, try the goulash!  The meat is so tender and flavorful. It's definitely not health food, but it's so good you don't even care.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because service is always slow."}
{"text":"I have to say I didn't have high expectations of finding good tasting authentic German food in this neck of woods, and I'm happy I was wrong!  In addition to the nice dÃ©cor, the lovely patio, and very quick and friendly service, you'll also find here a good variety of German and Hungarian dishes; beer from the ex Eastern European block (where the best beer is made), and overall very tasty food. The portions are huge! I knew I'll need a to go box as soon as I saw my portion. Definitely worth trying out and coming back!"}
{"text":"Ah, Das Schnitzel Haus!  I love me a good schnitzel!  My husband and I made plans to meet another couple there and arrived at around 6:30 last Saturday. When we walked in, there was no hostess stand and nobody greeted us, so we spotted the bar in the back and headed for it. A staff member stopped us on our way and asked how many would be in our party. We told him \"four\" and he told us that a couple booths would open up shortly. Cool!  At least someone was looking out for new faces!  The place was fairly busy but we got seated fairly quickly.  Our waitress, a mature woman with short grey hair, came by immediately to take our drink orders and noticed we already had beverages from the bar, so she said she'd give us time to look at the menu and she'd be back to take our orders. A very short time later she was back.  The menu has a lot of options and one of our party wasn't quite ready yet but our waitress appeared to be in a hurry so the undecided one offered to order last. Not a huge deal. I just felt like we were being rushed. In fact every time we interacted with her I got the feeling that we were taking up too much of her time. More on our waitress later...she's the reason I couldn't give this establishment any higher than 3 stars... We split an order of potato pancakes to start. These were perfect!  Crispy outside and creamy inside, I don't even think they needed the apple sauce and sour cream that accompanied them!  (But I plopped a little apple sauce on mine anyway.) The order was huge! 4 good-sized pancakes...I can't imagine NOT sharing! For my main course I opted for the Weiner Schnitzel and spaetzle and the cabbage & noodles as my sides. The cabbage & noodles were just ok. The spaetzle was delicious...tender and buttery. The Weiner Schnitzel?  WOW!  Possibly the best Weiner Schnitzel I've ever had!  And that comes from the girl that grew up on Sterle's Slovenian Country House's Schnitzel! The portion size left plenty for lunch the next day!   So let's get back to our hurried waitress. Our friend that dined with us stutters. At one point he ordered a Warsteiner, only it came out \"Wa..a..aa.arsteiner\".  The waitress parroted back to him \"Oh, you want a Wa.a.aa.arsteiner?\"  Holy Cow!!!!  I'm thinking, \"Did she really do that?!?\"  She completely mocked him!  The look on my face must've shown everything I was feeling because as soon as she walked away our friend tried to calm me down a little. I cannot believe she completely mocked him!  How incredibly rude!!! So there you have it... Good food....AWESOME Schnitzel....but the friendliness and sensitivity of our waitress left MUCH to be desired."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard about this place and wanted to try it. There is no good German/Polish food around the Youngstown area. We drove up on New years day and they were open and packed. Did not wait long, service was awesome. I ordered stuffed cabbage, mash potatoes, noodles and cabbage and my wife got kase schnitzel with spaetzel. The best food period, full of flavor. We finished off with apple and cherry strudel, which was also fantastic. Even with the wait, go. They have a good German beer selection and very down to earth atmosphere."}
