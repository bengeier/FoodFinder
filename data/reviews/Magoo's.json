{"text":"What is it with me and hole-in-the-wall bars? This place has good vibes and the barkeep is fun and friendly. I have discovered, yet another great little bar.

The kitchen was closed, I got here on a Sunday night so I was not too bothered by this. I just wanted a nice cold beer in a fun low key bar.

This place has potential and I hope you join me in making this little gem more attractive and fun for more than just a drink. I don't see a jukebox, but they do sell cigarettes. 

The beer is cold and as I stated the barkeep is cool. I hope to see you here in the near future. 

They were watching a tv show that was funny as heck. A good sign...sweet happy hour deal."}
{"text":"I've gone here ever since I was super little and their food is always good and the service is never too shabby. I especially enjoy their breakfast food (fully recommend the eggs and French toast!). Overall a 10/10 imo."}
{"text":"Very nice and attentive staff. Typical bar food. Dive bar atmosphere. Good happy hour prices. Locals hang out. Small. 1 pool table. Nothing impressive, but I'd go back sometime."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is great!!!! Great happy hour specials at the bar only. Have golden tee and great music. Atmosphere is chill. Separate dining room area so bring the family!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to play a little keno. I have a bad prostate and had been out shopping so I had to go. The skinny, brunette bartender stops me and says with an attitude, you have to be a paying customer to use the restroom. I was only about half way there when she said it. How did she know that's where I was even going? Anyway, I told her I was going to play keno but she said I have to spend it first so I played a few $'s while I held it. 

After I came out I played for about an hour and was the only customer. They were too cheap to use the A/C and she didn't once ask me if I needed anything. If I were her employer, the only thing I'd give her credit for is cleaning and actually working rather than being on their phone (which is what most lazy bartenders do when not serving). However, she was rude and had an attitude. 

Oh, while she was in the back a guy came in and ran for the bathroom. She came out when he was leaving (he came in just for that) and didn't say a word to him. I felt like making a comment but kept my mouth shut. How rude. If the customer service weren't so bad, John Taffer would be proud."}
{"text":"Best happy hour food in town! The tenders are worth stopping in for. Service is great,"}
{"text":"Always a good time at Magoos. Friendly staff and yet unfriendly machines, they have great food. I think sometimes we have to appreciate the finer things. Instead of worrying about hitting that 7 spot, or 8 spot or going for that Royal Flush; we should then try out their chicken fingers and onion rings. Those were too good. Like a poorly cooked steak... well done. Thankyou Magoos"}
{"text":"i I didn't have any problem with food, I mean nothing special but nothing wrong it ( typical bar food) the service was not that great, there was only one lady taking care of the entire bar and she was definitely not able to handle it by herself. My  main issue is that the atmosphere was not that great, I'm not a smoker so I do not enjoy places where I cannot longer smell my perfume lol... well I know most of bar spell a bit like smoke but this one was just too much..  (sorry smokers, I still love u )

{"text":"Great wings and fries! Wife and I keep coming back....over and over....great service... Nice waitress"}
{"text":"This one was not the best out of the two my boyfriend and I have gone to. We had gone later at night because we like to be alone and we get our food more quickly. The waitress that served us was nothing short of an unpleasant bitch, and that's being nice. She was constantly nosy, way too friendly with my boyfriend and rude to me, so much so she rolled her eyes when I had asked if she may get me some dipping sauce for my fries. The food I quite enjoyed, but the service was awful."}
