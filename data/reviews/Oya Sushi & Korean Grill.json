{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly staff, will definately be coming back. Ordered the dynamite roll as an appetizer and the chicken gatsu Benton box as my entree."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Mostly takeout right now as they have no tables, but the owners told us they were coming soon. We sat on stools at the sushi bar.   Food was great. Tried the bulgogi bento box, two sushi rolls, and an order of sashimi. Everything was well prepared, fresh, and had great flavor.   True \"mom and pop\" place. Owners are friendly, love what they do and the food they serve, and they made us a few \"extras\" while we were eating. If we lived locally, we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We got the $40 sushi platter, which was large, very fresh and delicious! The other entrees we ordered were also great. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Like eating home cooked food! Absolutely delicious. If you live in Mt. Lebanon you need to support this small restaurant. We need more places like this for amazing meals and not more chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and authentic. The chef even came by and asked us what we thought. I had the Kalbi short rib and it was delicious. We also got the Kimchi pancake and it was one of the better ones I've had. This place is the real deal.  Only downside is that it really is just a hole in the wall and has some of the disadvantages that come with that (small, a little dingy, etc.). However, oftentimes the best Korean food is found in little places like this and it certainly has that small restaurant charm that Pittsburghers are so fond of."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch with my wife on our day off and was really looking forward to trying the food. We showed up at 11:05 and the door was still locked. The girl standing beside the restaurant worked there but couldn't get in as the owner hadn't shown up yet. We waited five more minutes and when he still wasn't there, we left. Extremely disappointed that we planned to eat at Oya on our day off only to have them not show up for work. Don't make plans to eat here. They may not open for you."}
{"text":"By chance I found out about Oya Sushi from a Yelp message. If there's one thing the South Hills needs, it's a good place to get some Korean food. I live a few minutes away from Oya Sushi, so my daughter and I were excited to try it out after a long day running errands.  We got in around 5 on a Saturday evening, and decided to sit and order something to eat.   Of course we start with the Kimchi jeon, which was really good taste wise, I was just disappointed with the size, being just a bit larger than a regular breakfast pancake. The dipping sauce seemed to just be a side of soy sauce.  My daughter ordered the daegi bulgogi bento (pork), and I opted for the bibimbap. The bento box set up is nicely presented, but it was underwhelming to me because so much of the additions seemed pre-fab, or just box fillers. Daughter said the pork was perfectly seasoned, and spicy enough for her. Most of the accompaniments in the bento box, she preferred I eat them, gee thanks! It seems the offerings are rotated depending on the dish you order. There was rolled Korean omelette, mixed greens salad with a ginger type dressing, fried tempura shrimp, kimchi, and Korean braised potato.   The bibimbap I had was tasty after I added all the gochujang (red pepper paste sauce) I could to it. The variety of vegetables were all legitimate Korean style, soy bean sprouts, spinach, cucumber, and fried egg. The bulgogi style seasoned ground beef, irked me, because it took the authenticity down a notch.   The service was friendly, the miso soup not quite hot enough temperature wise, and the food overall was satisfying. It's a great change when I don't want to cook at home, so I'm pleased to see Oya not far from home."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner, it's an unassuming place(quite small) so make sure you're looking for it, if you're coming here. Now then, Service here is great, it wasn't busy while we were here so drinks came out right away, food was brought out as soon as it was done cooking. (You can actually hear them cooking! It's quite nice.) The chef is very, very nice and came out to speak with us about our food. He's very polite, and asks for criticism both good and bad so he can improve his cooking. He also took the time to explain sushi to my younger sibling! Over all, wonderful service.  Food wise: AMAZING! I got the Galbi Bento, and as a fan of Korean food this was some of the best I've had. Gyoza? Perfectly fried and delicious. Sushi? Fresh and delicious. Overall, everything is absolutely delicious and my family will definitely be coming back. Portion sizings are just right, and you will leave feeling full, rather than stuffed till you're sick like some restaurants can leave you feeling. Per person, my family spent 15$ a person. This was 3 bento entrees, their hibachi-chicken rice entree, and an order of Gyoza for the table. For such good food, this is a great price point.  Side note: HUZZAH! A place with Korean food that's affordable and in the South Hills! I highly suggest !"}
{"text":"This is simply the best Korean food I've had in the city! The owners are wonderful people! I've been there twice and love the kimchi peppered tuna sushi,  the kimchi papa burger (which is simply the best Korean American fusion I've had),  and the galbi is to die for. Definitely stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Korean food!  Very nice and clean atmosphere, friendly staff.  Food is top-notch, and reminiscent of food I've eaten in Busan or Seoul.  The Dolsot Bibimbap was amazing."}
{"text":"No. Awful. Service slow. Beef ramen was hamburger meat ground in with college bag ramen noodles. Sushi rolls came out warm."}
{"text":"I was hankering for some Korean food and came across this restaurant. So glad that I did because everything was excellent. My boyfriend got the sushi bento and I got the Korean spicy chicken bento. The portions were huge and there was a variety of sides included.  My sides were tempura shrimp, a gyoza, radish, salad, bean sprouts with spinach, and rice. We also got miso soup before our meal, but I'm not sure if it was included or they were being generous. They were definitely generous here with food. My boyfriend got extra pieces of sushi and we both got to try the hibachi steak. Everything was impressive and the staff was super nice. They also have wifi here, which is always a plus. I'll be back to try the bibimbap and ramen."}
{"text":"Stopped by based on some good reviews.  I'm sad to say that I can't write one of them.  Sushi was poor in quality.  Looks like their focus is mostly on Korean food.  Very friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"I think the South Hills could use a bit more diversity and authenticity when it comes to the restaurant scene so I was glad to see a place with katsu on the menu. I have ordered takeout from here a couple times and I will say I'm a fan! I was nervous to try it at first after driving past its small, slightly hole-in-the-wall appearing storefront, but I've enjoyed everything I've ordered so far!   Each time, my husband and I have ordered one the bento boxes and we've tried the chicken katsu, sushi bento box, spicy pork, and Korean pancakes. Everything has tasted fresh and beautifully prepared. However, one thing that prevents us from ordering from here more often is how long an order takes. I suppose I can't complain about this because you can tell they place a lot of time in preparing quality food, but when we're hungry, we kind of want our food fast. You know what I'm saying? Other than that, the food is very good and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a try today and we were pleasantly surprised.  My wife ordered Miso soup, a Scallop Roll and a Philadelphia roll.  The Miso soup was very good and the rolls were fresh.  I ordered the spicy korean chicken and it did not disappoint.  The owners were very kind and accomodating and we will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Very good sushi and Korean food. Clean place with very friendly staff and consistent food and service"}
{"text":"Tried my first takeout order from this new restaurant today and it was really good. Ordered the Chirashi Sushi Rice bowl. The Korean spicy sauce that comes on the side was delicious. Can't wait to try the Korean style BBQ short ribs and their Bibimbap looks really good too. They're also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We often go here for lunch and have completely fallen in love with the husband and wife who own the place. They're so warm and friendly you'll feel like family. The food is beautifully presented and tastes even better. I highly recommend the bento or the Pittsburgh roll."}
{"text":"After Easter break I had an empty fridge and I was bored with the usual take-out/delivery options, so I decided to wander over to Mt. Lebanon Blvd., where I'd been seeing a mysterious \"Sushi\" sign for the past few months. I found out it was a Japanese/Korean fusion restaurant, which suited my need for \"different\" since I've only had Korean once before, and that was over a decade ago.  The strip along Mt. Lebanon Blvd. is weird - a mix of '70s fab strip mall on one side of the road with some run-down, block-like storefronts and some new, attractive office buildings invading the aging commercial space on the other side. It's an awkward, car-centric block in a neighborhood that is mostly walking-friendly. Oya Sushi is in a recently renovated older building, which means that the frontage of some of its neighbors is still a work in progress.   Inside Oya Sushi it was cool and soothing, with lovely background music. Tables are along one wall and there is a long sushi counter in the center of the space with hanging decorations to block your view of the kitchen (which takes up the other half of the restaurant). There was one middle-aged man sitting in the back wearing a business suit quietly finishing up a bowl of something. If I hadn't known it, I would thought I'd stepped into a restaurant in the middle of Little Seoul or Little Tokyo, so complete was the transition.  I chose blindly from the menu, picking out bibimbap, kimchi jeon, and a seafood sushi roll. I had fun peering between the hanging flags that said \"SUSHI\" to watch my food cooking at the stove. After a short 10 minutes my take-out was ready. Everyone was friendly and the chef popped his head around the front of the counter to thank me on my way out the door.  Let me first say that everything was well-sealed. I'm always a little panicked when I drive take-out home, and even when my bag fell over in the car, nothing spilled or tipped out, which was a relief.   I opened up my bag and found that they had given me a 4 oz. serving of miso soup, which I was pleased about because I love miso. I started with the spicy shrimp roll I'd purchased, and was really happy with the quality. The shrimp was legit spicy, and everything had been freshly made while I waited, which always gives a basic roll a superior mouth-feel. Then I opened up my miso soup, which was the perfect temperature to just drink. It was delicious and I wished for more as soon as my bowl was empty. Not too salty, just the right consistency - I loved the miso.  Then I moved onto the kimchi jeon, which is a pancake made with pickled cabbage. I decided that I haven't found a pancake yet that I don't like (buckwheat, scallion, dosa, crepe, etc.). This did not disappoint - the homemade kimchi was delicious and the pancake was huge and perfectly crispy.  The last item was the bibimbap, which was very good. it's wasn't great, which is where my four (and a half) stars come in for the review. The ground meat was a bit dry and I found there was a bit too much rice, which I ended up pitching after I'd finished eating up all of the veggies, egg and meat. I really enjoyed the red sauce that came with the bibimbap, and it definitely finished off the dish. I will say that the veggies were all very fresh and cut right there after I ordered. There's something to be said for fresh, wholesome food. But after reading about the hot stone pot version with its crispy rice, I wish I'd upgraded to that, as it sounds like it might have been amazing.    I also wish I'd ordered some ramen, because after I was finished I really wanted something souplike to top things off. Oh, and maybe I should have ordered potstickers, because I'm always a fan of potstickers and the quality of a restaurant's basic recipes like that always tells me how good it is. Of course, I'm stuffed right now so I wouldn't have been able to eat it all, so that just means I'll have to go back to try the rest of it another time!"}
{"text":"2 wks ago my friend & her 1 yr old son& I went to OYaSushi fir first time . The owner was so nice got use high chair and my friend had Korean Bento box Steak & I had Calif Roll& lobster Roll both fresh and tasty! My friend loved the miso soup and her bento. Box too! Not many tables. But we went early and were only ones there after 11:30 am on Wednesday. I wish they Had a desert menu an I wish they served Grilled Octopus Korean style! I had that in a Korean restaurant in pittsburgh w side Kimchee .  My friends and I are having a special Lunch at your place August 31 we will have4 adults and 1 yr old baby- we want this to be a special lunch for our guest who has not eaten here nor has had Korean foods. Can I reserve table for us?"}
{"text":"I've had Bibimbap, the Bento Boxes and Hibachi.. all great, every time.. I've stopped? by for brunch 2 - 3 times a week since they opened.."}
{"text":"What a treat!    Food was fresh and tasty and service was great.  I loved that we were able to order delicious sushi as well as my Korean favorite - dolsot bibimbap (go for the dolsot bibimbap served in the stoneware pot).  We ordered the spicy scallop roll (delicious!), the dolsot bibimbap (pretty good but I have another fave place that serves it a little more 'sizzling' hot making the rice more crunchy) and the galbi (beef short rib) bento box (so good!)  Overall, this was a nice, close place to get great sushi and the bento box was awesome!  They also gave us miso soup which was good too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Everything on the menu is great and the staff is always so friendly.  High recommend for takeout or sit down."}
{"text":"This place is some of the best Korean you can find in Pittsburgh. Their bibimbap is good, the kimchi and kimchi pancake are both good. Anything Korean I've had here is great. Their sushi is so-so. It's hard to get good fresh fish around here so I give them a break, but I think if you want to taste something very special, you should really try something Korean from their menu.  Service is fast and nice, too. Good place for a little date or something.  I really want to try BBQ here but they don't have the set-in BBQ grills, I think they have to bring it to your table and I don't like that as much.  If they did an all-night Korean BBQ I would be so happy."}
{"text":"Got the korean fried chicken and bulgogi dish. Both good but too salty for my taste. I like family owned restaurants so i would go back to support."}
{"text":"Great little place. We had the sushi and potstickers and both were better than some of the other places in Pittsburgh. Also they Korean BBQ that you can make tableside. Only place I have found in Pittsburgh that does."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and the South Hills does not have any options until I found Oya! The chef clearly takes pride in his work and the food is outstanding and reasonably priced. My only complaint is that I wish it were bigger so I could go with my whole family!  Truly delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quaint, the service is fast, the food is FAN. TAST. IC. Especially the bento boxes, bibimbap, pot stickers, and miso. Whatever sauce that comes paired with the tempura--omg."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally tried Oya Sushi this evening after noticing it for a while. We both overate because we wanted to try everything, but we will have to come back to try other dishes. The cuisine was fresh and authentic. My wife had Beef Bulgogi and I had Dilsot Bibimbap. We shared side orders of Kimchi and Summer Roll Vege. Everything was delicious. Prices were reasonable. I think we will be returning often."}
{"text":"This is a cute little BYOB korean/sushi place in Mount Lebanon. To my utmost surprise and delight, the menu had a whole vegetarian section with options from veggie ramen to udon, bibimbap, potstickers and veggie rolls. I tried the veggie ramen and veggie summer roll, both of which I loved. There's something about the food, perhaps the freshness of the produce or the ingredients that induce a 'home-made' quality to the food here. The  portions are quite generous and each order comes with miso soup. I ended up boxing most of my roll because the ramen was really filling. The service is incredibly sweet and polite. I'd highly recommend this place and I definitely intend to come back to try some of the other rolls and the bibimbap. They also have kimchi burgers!! My favorite thing was this a video they had playing on their large lcd display of a warm crackling fire which I found incredibly cute! Hey.. it's the next best option to the real thing..and you don't even have  to deal with the smoke and kindling!! An extra gold star for that touch!! :)"}
{"text":"Only reason they don't get 5 is because I don't give 5's. Have been here a bunch now and it's true Korean.  Bimbibap, ramen soup, gyoza, are all great. Sushi is better than solid. The owners and workers are all really appreciative that you came.  Only downside is they are starting out and have to multitask between server role, host and register.  I'm rooting for this place and encourage you to stop in."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem!  Excellent authentic Korean food! Excellent Sushi!  The staff is amazing and always so nice.  We try different menu items every time we come in and have NEVER had a bad item.  My Wife and I love this place and we will keep going back."}
{"text":"I had a group of 6 on a weeknight.  Not a lot of tables in there, but it wasn't crowded and we were able to push two together.   The staff consisted of two people.  One to wait on us and one to cook.  The server was new - very friendly, but not all that in touch with the menu.   She did her best though and suggested a few dishes that did please our group.     The food had a lot of potential.  Most of us really liked our dishes, but there were a few misses too.   I ordered the kimchi pancake.   It could have been good, but it was pretty burnt on one side (they put that side down of course).   The charred taste sort of overwhelmed it.  My bulgogi bento box was good.  Would order that again.    The main miss for my group is that we had a couple dietary restrictions that were mixed up, resulting in a shellfish allergy being served shrimp.   The chef came out to address whether the whole meal was compromised as a result determined that only the shrimp needed replaced.   I'm not 100% sure the diner was altogether comfortable with this, but she rolled on.     Overall, there isn't a lot of ambiance or frills, but I think you can get a good meal here.  I'd probably do takeout next time."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend loved his sushi platter."}
{"text":"My first time here was around 8:30 PM Monday January 30th. I ordered a rainbow roll and some tea. The rainbow roll was delicious and well presented. I can't wait to try their other sushi items because the rainbow roll was so good. I also ordered spicy chicken to go and some chicken potstickers. When I got home I just had to taste my takeout items which were supposed to be for tomorrow. Wow , I had to force myself to stop eating. The food is good. I saw some other reviews that indicated they didn't have tables, they are wrong now. They have plenty of tables. I will definitely be back for more. Bon appétit I just finished one of the best meals I've had in months. Chef James prepared for me the authentic Korean Version of BIBIMBAP . What I mean by authentic is that it was prepared with the crispy rice in the bottom of the proper hot bowl and topped off with an egg and his special sauce to pour over it to make it even more spectacular. Other restaurants make this dish however they just make it in a regular bowl and do not crisp the Rice the way it's supposed be prepared. They also don't have the intricate level of flavors that Chef James and his brother John puts in their dish. If you want to experience this dish you must ask for the authentic version. It does cost a little more however it's well worth it. Don't be in a hurry just come and relax enjoy some tea or soup and conversation until your food arrives. This is not a fast food restaurant, Everything is prepared from scratch so if it's crowded it may take some time. The sushi is great and so are the many other dishes on the menu.I normally don't write long reviews,but this time I'll make an exception since the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"I really like this place. While it's certainly nothing fancy, the owners and the workers are very friendly. I think in some ways they're still learning the ropes of the restaurant business - sometimes service can be a bit uneven. But it doesn't detract from your meal.   As far as the food, everything I've had has been excellent. I've always stuck to the Korean menu items, along with the Ramen. The Ramen is the best I've had anywhere ,with fresh tasting flavorful broth and vegetables. Try it with the Gyoza - potstickers."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's so hard to decide what you want to eat... this was perfect as you can go with Korean or Sushi. I came here to get take out around dinner time. There was no one in the restaurant so the service was quick. I got the bibimbap, bugolgi bento, salmon roll and tuna roll. While waiting, I went next door to grab a beer and sit outside. Definitely recommend it if it's nice outside and you're doing take out! The food came out promptly and it was well packaged.   The sushi rolls were pretty good and I enjoyed the avocado in them. However, the bibimbap came with ground beef which in my experience with Korean food, it's always been sliced beef. There was barely any meat but it was filled with rice. The same thing with bugolgi, it was ground beef which was unusual. The price of the sushi rolls were fair but not for the bibimbap which I thought was pricey for the amount of meat."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Korean food comes to the South Hills. I had the seafood soon dubu jigae, a spicy soup with soft tofu and seafood. This was the best I've had of this dish (and I've had it at many places), very generous with the clams, mussels, etc. We came for lunch on a Friday and were the only party in the place. This should change. Family run place that deserves to be more popular, very friendly service. A real find."}
{"text":"I've been stopping here for lunch every once In a while sense they've opened and I have yet to have a bad experience. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, and I tried the ramen bowl for the first time a couple days ago and it was absolutely delicious!!! So far so good! I'll continue going over for lunches"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  The food is so fresh and the owners are the nicest people I've come across in a long while.  It's so casual, but high quality. They really want to make sure everything tastes good.  They also treated my daughter like a princess. We WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Dang. I can't speak for the sushi, as we didn't get any, but the Korean food here is killer. My husband and I stopped in for lunch today and we're both impressed. Attentive wait staff, good selection on the menu. The gyoza were nice and crispy, delicious pork filling, fresh. The dolsot bibimbap was perfect- the rice got nice and crispy and the bowl cooked the egg. Kimchi jigae took me right back to my local kimbap joint in Busan- bubbling hot, served with rice, spicy and savory. After we'd finished our meal and paid, the lovely Korean lady brought us some haemool patron (seafood pancake), offering it for us to try, and asking that they were adding it to the menu. Warm, crunchy, savory- just everything it should have been. We agreed that we can't wait to go back to try more of their selections."}
{"text":"Hosted a group dinner of 8 people at Oya. The owner was very accomodating even though the place was small and busy.  They're still getting everything smoothed out, but all our food came out at the same time and correctly prepared. The family that runs the place is very sweet. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal here but need to go again to try more things. The pancake was delicious as well as the Ramen. Chicken bulgogi was good but dont go to high with the heat. Got it at a 3 and it was spicy and I can handle spicy. Too bad there were annoying customers next to us. Not the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"First time here, I got the Bulgogi bento box and it was excellent. Food was steaming hot and fresh, service was very prompt and friendly. Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Relatively new Korean restaurant in Mount Lebanaon. I think a few kinks are still being worked out and they could use an extra set of hands (at least when we were there) but, the few minor glitches were in fact minor, and will not prohibit me from coming back.   Our server (and I think owner) was very polite and was worked his butt off the whole! He appeared to enjoy every minute and greeted everyone with a smile. Service was a little slow only because the owner was doing everything from taking orders to answering the phone and cleaning tables. He even helped in the kitchen. I actually liked the pace though because I didn't feel rushed or bothered like I do sometimes at other restaurants. Our meal was very relaxed and enjoyable.   The restaurant is small inside with only 4-5 tables and a few seats at the sushi counter. Prices were very reasonable with 2 of us eating dinner for only $25. BYOB with no cork fee! Beat that! The restaurant and bathroom was very clean. Takeout is also available.   The miso soup was flavorful and did not disappoint. While I like my bibimbap and would get it again, I missed the crispiness of the rice which I thought was supposed to be classic of a bibimbap. My husband loved the spicy sauce that came with the bibimbap. Regardless, I liked it and would have it again. Some of the sushi looked amazing and I can't wait to try that next!   I hope Oya sushi does well and I plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town at the price point. Owners are warm and welcoming, the food is fresh and delicious. The restaurant is extremely clean and well kept.  Ordered the salmon roll and spider roll, and my SO got the sushi bento box, everything was on point and better than you'd see and tastier than places that charge twice as much. The nigiri were massive. This is a must for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"Miso soup taste good but not too hot ,Sit down for dinner  Nice and clean little place but im not into a melanine and styrofoam cup for hot drink..."}
{"text":"Residents of the South Hills need to support Oya Sushi.  I had a very nice late afternoon lunch on a Thursday.  Four stools were positioned next to the sushi counter with space for tables in the coming days/weeks.  I ordered the bibimap and was impressed with the exceptionally fresh ingredients.  Additionally, a sample of kimchi jeon and kimbap was provided.  They were very good too which will make it difficult to decide what to order on my next visit.  Best of all, the owners/operators/chef were warm, friendly and welcoming.  They take pride in their business for good reason - it is truly exceptional."}
{"text":"I watched them pull every single thing out of the freezer and then serve me a freezer burned oil soaked pile of garbage... no pride in the work here"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a dining experience that was so satisfying that you want to run into the parking lot and scream, \"Oh my Gawd! You have to try this place!\" I did and I ... did.  After dining at Oya Sushi, not only did I send text pictures of my meal to three people and told two moms at the school pick up, before I left the parking lot, I gleefully approached an older woman going to get her hair cut. \"You have to try Oya Sushi. You have to.\" \"I'm getting my haircut,\" she said. \"I don't like sushi.\" \"A ha!\" I blasted. \"It's more than just sushi.\" And it was. A total culinary experience.  First let me say I am not one for going to those 'dart and go' international cuisine places, which I thought Oya sushi was. And I'm not one to 'dine in' at a place that is a take out joint.  While Oya is small and has only a few tables, there is table service. It's like ... going to your uncle's house for dinner. On my visit there were two employees, both men, both pleasant, and both not only the servers, but the chefs as well. They take pride in what they make and love what they do and that is evident in the taste of the food.  We were given a complimentary bowl of miso soup. If you think all miso is so-so, you need to try this, it was awesome.  My lunch buddy is not a sushi person, but she was excited to see something called a Kimchi Burger. Neither of us knew what it was, so she ordered it anyhow.  She said it melted in her mouth, cooked to perfection, topped with cheese and served with home cut fries. It's a burger with veggie inside.  Because I can live off Ramen, I ordered the Vege Ramen and an order of something I never heard of  Kimchi Jeon.  Holy cow, Maruchen Noodles have lost their place in my heart. This ... was the real deal. The noodles weren't soggy or big and fat like Top Ramen, they were freaking perfect. The broth had just the right amount of heat and the egg on top ....okay, I have to stop. I may have to go again tomorrow.  The Kimchi Jeon is like a pancake with vegetables. It's tender and tasty and the dipping sauce so perfect I could drink it. I brought a few pieces home for my daughter and she said it tasted like a spring roll pancake.  Everything was aesthetically pleasing and the price was $23.00 for everything.  I know this review is long, but I can't say enough about Oya Sushi. My lunch buddy commented that not once did I reach for the salt shaker ... that never happens. Everything was fantastic.  I left happy. My curiosity about Oya was satisfied, my tummy was pleased and my debit card did a happy dance after the bill arrived."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Korean restaurant in the area. The staff was super friendly and helpful with the menu. It is BYOB.. we didn't even try the sushi because the bulgogi bento box, Kimchi pancake, and Bibimbap were so delicious and filling. We can't wait to go back soon and try something else"}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely delicious. The dining room consists of about 6 tables so consider calling ahead. I had the veggie Ramen and Ginger salad- both were outstanding. The server was very attentive. The wait for the food was about an hour but well worth it. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, it was hours before my family and I ate last,  but upon reading yelp reviews for the restaurant, we filled our starving  tummies up with the best food on the market here at this Korean Restaurant. The food, with phenomenal taste, came amiably in authentic style. The server is wonderful, a very nice, hardworking woman. My kids and I enjoyed our night favorably.  Ps, though this sounds like a fairytale, I am being legitimate.  Follow these crumbs to oya sushi and say o-ya!"}
{"text":"I came in here for dinner with my boyfriend who wanted to try authentic Korean cuisine. We were not let down. He got the chicken ramen and I got the Spicy Chicken Bento. Neither of us were disappointed. The spice levels were perfect and there was nothing Americanized about it! And to top it all off our server Anne was kind, energetic, and very informative!"}
{"text":"Can I say Oy!  We had a group of seven.  All tables are for 4.  We put two tables together.  A table of 3 came in right before us and someone was waiting for take out.  When we ordered we   were told a couple of items would take a little bit but that was OK.  So we waited and waited.   We waited and waited. 70 minutes after our order, two dinners came out.  10 minutes later 3 dinners came out.  Finally, after 90 minutes the sushi and last 2 dinners came out.  The Miso soup was served first and was not warm enough.  A couple of people called in for take out and came to pick it up and waited for long periods, one was given a bowl of Miso soup while she waited.   The food was good but the wait was over the top.   The place is loud, the ventilation fan has a very high hum and made it hard to hear someone talking if you were at one end of the table and they were at the other end of the table. Probably should just do take out and be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and Korean food at very reasonable. Very friendly staff. It took a while to get our food due to many takeout orders. But it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot in the south hills! Sushi is great. The owners are very sweet and do a great job, check it out and support your local business!"}
{"text":"Three  things I 'm big on: fresh, flavorful food, supporting small businesses, and great service. KAPOW! You have a triple header here.   Oya, which just opened last week, is owned  by husband and wife, James and Kim.  Born in Korea, they have a true passion and commitment to making delicious, fresh food, and excellent customer service.  They make the Miso soup, fresh daily, using James' mother's recipe. The sushi, also, is made fresh daily. I enjoyed a lfragrant, flavorful bowl of vegetable miso soup, and a bowl of ramen noodles, to start. They were both well-balanced, in a rich, tasty broth.  I ordered the salmon an avocado sushi, the best I 've had in well, probably ever.   The dining room is spacious, and classically minimalist in decor, especially furniture. They are eagerly awaiting their dining tables and chairs to be delivered, but until then, dine at the beautiful granite counter on nicely padded chairs. This also gives you the opportunity to talk with Kim and James, if you wish. They are very gracious hosts, and intwresting people.   I plan on a return tonight for dinner, and many more in the future."}
{"text":"Not bad for American style sushi in the South Hills.  Beautiful presentation, took it home to enjoy. The restaurant was empty at 2 o'clock on a weekday Stopped in for some sushi. Told the owner to surprise me with three specialty rolls of his choice and also ordered a vegetable sushi roll. He ended up making me a Alaskan salmon and tuna with jalapeño, An all cooked fried shrimp and crispy onion roll as well as a smoked salmon and shrimp roll.  The owner was very nice, and him but next time I think I will try to Korean food since he is Korean."}
{"text":"Love it. It takes me back to Japan every time I come here. All those simple little shops with delicious sushi. The ramen here is creative too. It comes in the traditional great big bowl. My daughter and I usually share it. BYOB which is common here with Asian places, but if you get your food to go there is a distributor right next door with a nice front patio where you can enjoy your rolls on a cool Autumn evening. The barbeque menu is wonderful as well and always evolving. Great place to dine if you aren't in the mood for a sandwich with fries on it."}
{"text":"The restaurant has tables now! I went for my third visit yesterday and was just as pleased as always. I tried the gyoza ramen and their sushi (the spicy scallop) for the first time. The ramen was full of vegetables and the broth was delicious. The dumplings were really flavorful. I once tried the ramen up the street at Little Tokyo and was really disappointed - this was nothing like that. I would recommend the ramen here!  The spicy scallop roll was really fresh and delicious. I was happy to see that their spicy roll does not mean that they chop up the fish into a weird mayo salad situation - the scallop was intact and soft and tasted great. The roll was NOT covered in sauce, which I feel is a problem with a lot of Pittsburgh sushi places. If you are so inclined to drown your sushi in sauce, there was a beautiful display of sauce on the side. I included photos. The presentation was nice - they shaped my wasabi into a leaf. Now that there are tables this will be a great little place to bring friends and family. James also said he is fine with BYOB and currently does not charge a corkage fee, which will be super convenient since there is a great beer spot right next door with 6 packs to go!"}
{"text":"Oya sushi has amazing prices for sushi and the atmosphere is really cute and calming. Its also really hard to find good korean places in the suburbs so this place is a breath of fresh air. I think one of the staples of Oya sushi are the bento boxes which give you a ton of really good food for a super super cheap price. The gentleman who works here is also super sweet so if youre one to support small businesses take a visit here."}
{"text":"This is a new place to Mt. Lebanon and so far I love it. The prices are very good for the quality of fish. Ive tried the avocado and salmon sushi and the grilled eel roll. Both were great along with the miso soup. I definitely will be back! I love the service they give as well, very cute owners."}
