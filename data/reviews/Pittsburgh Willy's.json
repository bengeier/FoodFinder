{"text":"I had some time on my hands and decided to try this little place out. Very friendly atmosphere, prices are overall fair as well. I ordered the open faced chili dog. VERY good! Best I've had.  Also had a half size order of fries which, quite honestly, didn't reach the level of greatness of the dog.  they were just ok.   Still, I plan on visiting this place again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had the Phoenix Times Best of Phoenix Pittsburgher at Wimpy's Paradise in Downtown Chandler.  It was decent but, but I don't think it qualifies as the best in Phoenix.  The bun was typical, the dog itself was sizable and of good quality, and it was topped with cut up ham and shredded cheese... but not overloaded by any means.  All in all, nothing special... maybe even a little dry.  For $7, I would pass on it.  I would like to try the burgers, and, if I did order another dog, it would need some chili or something.  The folks working there seemed pretty nice."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick meal while downtown Chandler.  The restaurant was busy, but quickly served the ham sliders I ordered.  They were awesome!  Inexpensive, but hit the spot for flavor and price along with quick service.  The owner took the time to make sure all the patrons were satisfied.  Small town atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"Referred by a co-worker to Pittsburgh Willy's and we were not disappointed! The owner sat at the table with us and answered any questions we had. We ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger, the Arizona Dog and I can't remember the name of the burger my husband ordered that had a fried egg and a thick slice of fried Bologna on it. Everything was delicious and my son found it to be the closest thing he has had to the completos he loved so much in Chile. We also tried the Twinkie/Banana/Nutella/Peanut butter dessert featured there and were surprised at how tasty the combination was. Looking forward to trying their world famous Twilly Dog! We spent quite a bit of time enjoying our meal and conversation with the owner. Overall it was a great experience and we plan to have our extended family meet there for dinner there next month."}
{"text":"Great place for a fantastic hot dog and ice cream cones and shakes. And there is a great candy bar too."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun!  This place has great burgers and hot dogs, a cool little candy shop, and some fun menu items like \"Twinkie dogs\".  I wouldn't eat there on a diet but the hot dog with chili and Mac and cheese is so good!   The ice cream sandwich sounds amazing too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is where the people from every small town goes to eat good food. Randy serves everything fresh and delicious. He goes out of his way when it comes to customer service and community involvement.  My daughter is allergic to beef and he keeps turkey products so she can always get her turkey pastrami sandwich. We ate breakfast there today for the first time and it was one of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had. I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today. I can't believe how good the fried bologna & egg sandwich tasted. The sausage gravy & biscuits were he best I've had since I've lived in Arizona. Randy, the owner, spoke with all the customers and made sure their meals and service were spot on. It will continue to be my favorite place to eat in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Great little spot for burgers and hot dogs. The owner is very friendly and hands on with the customers. I had the cheeseburger with potato salad and it was pretty solid. The bf ordered a plain hot dog and home fries and he enjoyed them both. They also have a little section of candy, etc you can buy and a good selection of bottled beverages."}
{"text":"To be fair only went there once. Food was ok but nothing special. As a kid growing up on East Coast was a Pirate fan and saw my first game at 3 Rivers in the 70s. Maybe he was having a bad day but  could care less. Never went because of that first encounter with the owner."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Willy's merged with Wimpy's Paradise, and both restaurants' menus are served at Wimpy's in downtown Chandler, just south of the San Marcos resort.  Randy Walters' food won an award for his Pittsburgher dog, being #21 in the Phoenix New Times Top 100 entrees in metro Phoenix.  His 2.5 lb. challenger burger made Phoenix magazine's cover for one of their Best of Phoenix area entrees.  Great job, Randy!"}
