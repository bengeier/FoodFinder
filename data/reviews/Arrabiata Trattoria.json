{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast with my boyfriend while on vacation and we loved it so much we stopped back in for dinner later that night with my family!

For breakfast I ordered the asparagus and brie crepe and TD (the dude) had the fruit crepe. Both came with really yummy potato wedges. Everything was fresh and reasonably priced and just enough food. No ginormous portions of greasiness here. When we came back for dinner we sat upstairs and had lots of pasta, garlic bread, and wine. Upstairs the seating was more intimate and had a really nice, cozy feel. The service was great both times."}
{"text":"Yonge street is one of the busiest streets on Toronto and yet I really wonder why the selection is mostly horrible along the street! Lucky for us, it seems to be heading in the right direction with Arrabiata. From outside it doesn't look like anything special but once inside the service is excellent and the food was very good (and not too expensive either!). Definitely a good place to grab a bite and relax with a small group of friends! 

We tried the Bianca and Lucia pizzas and were genuinely pleased with the portion and taste. Their menu is pretty much classic Italian and can be seen on their website with their prices as well."}
{"text":"My experience at Arrabiata was alright...but I'd be willing to give it another shot, and recommend it, for many reasons. 

1) My waiter was very fast, friendly and gracious.
2) Everyone food around me looked really good.
3) It's a nice clean space close to the subway.

The thing is, I ordered just some garlic bread and soup for lunch while I was there....and it was not great. Actually, the bread was good, but the soup (asparagus carrot) was really overly peppery, like someone accidentally dropped too much pepper into the pot and decided to just stir it and it would go away. Plus there were sort of husks of hard end bits of asparagus floating in it (it was a pureed soup, but those parts? Not so much). 

But! I am willing to take another chance. My only advice? Don't get the soup."}
