{"text":"We had an awesome lunch at the office courtesy of Sushi Yamaguchi...food was great!"}
{"text":"Crispy salmon roll is outta sight!  Everything was very fresh and beautifully prepared.  Moderately priced for sushi.  I purchased about 5 rolls for $40.  Rolls were plentiful, we had plenty leftover for lunch the next day.  Staff was extremely friendly, even offered to make custom rolls.  Only drawback...no AYCE."}
{"text":"I decided to hit up Sushi Yamaguchi since it was close to my school, CSN Charleston, and to fix my Japanese food craving. I walked in the restaurant and sat on one end of the sushi bar as I came there on my own. It took a little while before I was approached but I knew they were quite busy, especially since they had one server taking care of everyone. She was very kind and friendly. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the lunch combination and found that it was more than enough food for one. But it satisfied my hunger, for sure.

One thing that went wrong was that I had to ask about my miso soup after my plate was served. But I guess it turned out alright since that became my desert.

Overall, I'd recommend coming in and checking it out. Its a very laid back and friendly environment and the lunch prices are a real deal."}
{"text":"Gratz sushi anyway, but I still CANNOT believe that people said it is not that expensive, and fill full under $30 or $40, and each sushi is about finger big."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff sit at the bar and the owner makes everything and has a good story about his background"}
{"text":"Was there with my grandma... food, service excellent authentic Japanese!  Just lovely!"}
{"text":"We live out of state; but every time we visit Vegas, we eat here at least once or twice during our 4-5 day vacation. Japanese food is generally expensive, but Sushi Yamaguchi is very reasonable. The food is always delicious and the portions are just right. We haven't had anything that we didn't like yet."}
{"text":"Hi everyone!

I first went to this place because it's right by the English school I attend. So I yelped for a Sushi restaurant nearby that I could go for my 30min lunch! Unfortunately, it took a little longer than my 30min lunch. However, it was exactly what I expect sushi to be. Very fresh fish, large pieces of fish and not a lot of rice. Plus, the rice is not sticky like in some other places. I always order salmon avocado with green onions (that Ken does especially for me, he is ok with doing rolls the way you like) and the albacore nigiri (that tastes so good you don't even have to dip in soy sauce). This is real sushi, not those american kind full of mayo that look more like a hamburger than like a sushi!"}
{"text":"Local restaurant, really small... Owner is the chef... Really funny and nice guy. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Best traditional sushi in Vegas!!!! Quite and intimate atmosphere, owner selects and makes the sushi."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Portions are kinda small. It's a cozy spot."}
{"text":"Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unassuming and nondescript plaza, is this small sushi spot. The menu is also small but the fish is fresh, the chef is friendly, and the service is slightly on the slow side but they're not too busy to get you in and out if you need to: they're just used to folks hanging around chatting after they're done dining. Essentially, it's a neighborhood sushi dive bar.

BLACK FIRE ROLL has eel and a not-overwhelming amount of cream cheese (among other fish) topped with eel sauce and sesame seeds, while the ALASKAN ROLL is pretty standard. Before tip, my total was about $18.

PS: the whiteboard menu has a few silly jokes on it too (goldfish, bad jokes, and good jokes), and if you look around the kitschy d√©cor you'll notice cans of Spotted Dick and Fish Asshole... and a bottle of moonshine sake with a snake in the bottom. Fun."}
{"text":"The fish was good. But not better than other places in Vegas that have much better service and atmosphere. I'm giving this a 3 because that's what it is--pretty mediocre. It was good, but not a notable sushi place."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews, i decided to check out this place, just a little dissapointed. Theres not enough choices on the menu so i just had couple of nigiri then went to osaka. I think this place is too small of a restaurant to carry different types of fish. They dont even have toro in stock that night."}
{"text":"The best sushi Ive had in Vegas my husband and I love it here! There is only one sushi chef, Ken, but he is very personable, like you've known each other for years. Awesome service, so seat at the sushi bar! Traditional Japanese sushi and fresh quality. Ask for the snake sake!"}
{"text":"One of my fav local joints. Owner Ken is funny w/ great personality. Fish is fresh, delicious. The vibe is personable & quaint. I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"Nice staff but the food 
 was not good. I could get the same thing at grocery store."}
{"text":"Sushi Yamaguchi used to be a regular hangout for me when I worked at the Charleston campus of CSN.  This is a small, traditional Japanese sushi restaurant, with an awesome staff.  I've read somewhere that the owner started the sushi craze here in Las Vegas.  His son, Ken, is the main sushi chef now.  He's a great guy, and I always enjoy a conversation with Ken while I also enjoy some sushi.  By the way, Ken and his father are actually Japanese, which apparently is rather rare in Las Vega for sushi restaurants.

Now, I am not a super sushi expert or anything, but I have had sushi at a few places in my time.  Yamaguchi has always had a sense of quality that other places just don't seem to have.  The rice is nicely prepared, the fish is wonderful, and the craftsmanship is perfect.  Yamaguchi has your traditional sushi and sashimi, but it also has seasonal, experimental rolls.  I love the homemade sauces that they use.  You can just taste the quality ingredients, as opposed to the cheap, over sugared sauces of some other places. 

The two downsides are that it is a small place, so you don't want to go with a huge crowd.  Also, it takes a while to get your food.  Trust me though, it is worth the wait.  if you are a sushi fan, I think you need to try Sushi Yamaguchi."}
{"text":"My husband I decided to get off the strip and enjoy dinner here after reading the reviews on Yelp.  We were glad that we did!

The food was very good.  The complimentary edamame was a plus.  I like my miso soup \"strong\" (not watered down), so I was quite pleased with their vesion.  Our sushi was fresh and tasty.

Even better than the food, if that's possible, was the service.  The owner, Ken, has a great personality.  He talks with his patrons and makes them feel at home.  He also has a great sense of humor.

My husband tried the snake sake, per another reviewers tip.  He thought it tasted better than \"typical\" sake and suggests that you try it too."}
{"text":"I've have been there twice and had great experiences both times. It's one of those hometown spots. The food was very good and Ken is super nice.  I intend on being a regular."}
{"text":"Good sushi place, prices are reasonable.  Nothing outstanding, but it a good place to go and I will be going back again.  The service was outstanding, although I did go at lunch and there were not many people there."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Ken, the owner, kept my friends and me laughing the entire time we were here on our last leg of vacation.  The food was fresh and delicious. I would make it a point to come back here next time I am out in Vegas because of my experience."}
{"text":"I was glad to try a new sushi joint, but not so happy after I took a bite out of my third piece of sushi. I ordered a california roll and it could have not been more simple, but   to my unfortunate surprise there was wasabi in my sushi, which I learned later is the traditional and accurate way to make sushi. 

I personally hate wasabi and can't eat anything spicy, so to have an unexpected pinch of wasabi in my meal was like a punch to the face. I ate the forth piece of sushi and ended my meal there, cause it was just too spicy for my taste buds to finish. 

I suppose I've been spoiled by places like Kabuki and Yama Sushi, which do not put wasabi in your rolls, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. Anywho, everything was fine and the prices are fair and next time I'll know what to ask for."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not one of those AYCE sushi places. Personally, there is nothing wrong about those type of places if all you want is quantity. Yamaguchi Sushi is more of a Mom & Pop type of place. 
I was with my family (Mother & Brother) and decided that a nice Japanese dinner would be a good idea. As soon as we enter the restaurant we were greeted by Ken (the owner) & a friendly Japanese waitress (always a good sign at a Japanese restaurant). We were immediately taken to a nice table near the sushi bar. Next we were informed about certain items that were not available (due to being sold out / the vendor was not able to provide a quality product). I know that some individuals would be upset about this. Personally, I commend an establishment that would rather not have an item(s) than to try and provide a product that may or may not be satisfactory. 
On with the order: Everyone started with some complimentary edamame which was very tasty. My mother ordered the combination dinner (Salmon & Shrimp Tempura), brother had a couple of specialty sushi rolls that Ken recommended, & I had the combination (Sashimi & Teriyaki Beef). The presentation was very nice and the food was freshly prepared. When I received the check, I was pleasantly surprised that the meal cost far less than an AYCE place (dinner prices). I will defintely return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the restaurant didn't live up to the other reviews. The sushi rice was very mushy and overly sweet. The udan bowl was decent and free edamame was pretty good, steamed well but for sushi I would not return.  Fish quality seemed only okay but in vegas you can find great sushi. Overall the restaurant was dim and a little dirty feeling. The plastic covering the tables not only feels cheap but also wasn't cleaned well."}
{"text":"Sooo I was driving back to work and noticed the 3.50$ Chicken Teriyaki lunch special, I drove back and ordered the special. OH EM GEEE! It was delicious, well cooked and flavorful! I think i'm addicted! It was so cheap and the potion was pretty big. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Charleston!! Definitely try their specialty rolls. They have unique rolls not found at other sushi restaurants in the area. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy sushi bar and restaurant far off the beaten path of the Las Vegas strip. The fish is very high quality and is priced accordingly. This is not a cheap all-you-can-eat place. The sushi chef is also the owner. He has a great sense of humor (ask him about the knick knacks over the sushi bar). My only complaint is that they do close early, 10pm."}
{"text":"Excellent!

This little sushi place is tucked in a small shopping center on Charleston and Jones, and Yelp led me right to it. My friends and I are up-and-coming sushi connoisseurs, and we were pleased with every aspect of Sushi Yamaguchi.
The service was polite, and the atmosphere was traditional and true to the Japanese culture. Albeit small, this place packs a wallop! Our top picks from the menu were the tootsie roll, rainbow roll, and lava roll. Other selections are also very pleasant, but I could be here all day praising their menu. Most importantly, you can taste the freshness of every roll.
They also offer complimentary soybeans at the beginning of the meal, which was a pleasant and sufficient appetizer over casual conversation.
Overall, very generous selection, very fair pricing, and spectacular service.

Did I mention they accept groupons? :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely great sushi and I've been coming here since they opened. Good lunch specials on bento boxes, etc., for those non-sushi patrons. The sushi chef, Ken, is the most knowledgeable and friendly sushi chef I've experienced in 23 years in Vegas. Sushi Yamaguchi is my first choice for great sushi!"}
{"text":"Finally!  Great sushi in Vegas!  Thank you, Master Chef Ken, for indulging us half an hour before you close shop for the evening with your ono-licious dishes of fresh sashimi and artistic displays!  We'll be back!  :-)"}
{"text":"I normally hate to give negative reviews about anything, having worked for many years in the service industry myself.  Unfortunately, the experience I had here tonight compels me to share my thoughts regarding this restaurant.   As a bit of context, I am a Las Vegas local and have tried many sushi restaurants in the area.  I would go back to any of them before I come back here. 

Food:  Average, at best.  The edamame was served cold - the first time I've ever been served cold edamame in a restaurant.  Further, there was no creativity with the rolls. The flavors were simply fish and rice with nothing to bring out the flavor of the tuna, salmon, or eel.  The heavy use of green onions, chives, and spices overpowered the sushi rather than having a pleasant mix of heat to bring out the natural flavor of the dish.  You'll find a much better variety and more complex flavors in other places.  

Atmosphere:  Simplistic and uninviting.  The setup is merely a  waist-high sushi bar with approximately 10 tables crowded into a narrow space.  Decorations were sparse, and the lighting was more akin to a dim office environment.   It wasn't dirty. But the layout and the colors don't make you feel comfortable either.  

Service:  Sadly, the worst part of the meal.  As a note, my girlfriend and I did not sit at the bar.  Thus, we were not served by the owner, Ken, that is referenced in other reviews here.  Instead we were served by a very young looking girl - the only server there that night.  Besides two gentlemen at the sushi bar, my girlfriend and I were the only ones there.  We had to actually ask for the separate menu that listed the sushi rolls.  You would think a server in a SUSHI restaurant would have the presence of mind to give SUSHI menus with the regular menus.  We also had to ask for plates. And silverware.  And dishes to pour the soy sauce/wasabi into.  And, although she hovered uncomfortably around the table (during what was obviously supposed to be an intimate meal between my girlfriend and I), waiting to snatch and refill my water like a kitten on a ball of yarn, when we needed to pay for the meal, she was nowhere around to give us our check.  She was there when we didn't want her there and not there when we needed her.

Price:  Overly priced, but not egregiously.  There's no all you can eat menu (not atypical in Las Vegas).  But even the simplest rolls were a couple dollars too much for what you get.   We went there because we had a $10 coupon gift through restaurant.com.  Turns out if you use that coupon, you have to spend at least $20 (somewhat understandable) and they will force you to pay an 18% tip, regardless of the size of your party.  It's a cheap and misleading tactic that defeats the purpose of the coupon.  I normally tip 20%.  But I don't want to feel forced to tip - especially when it's not a large size party.

Bottom line: Go to ANY other sushi place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was nice and friendly, but slow and there was only one other person in the restaurant. The sushi was average, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Sushi Yamaguchi! First time here and enjoyed dinner very much. Very nice staff and the food was delicious. I got a Philadelphia roll and Katsu Don. The sushi roll was made perfectly and was easy to consume... I sometimes have a hard time with sushi because sometimes they fall apart, these rolls were made nicely and was easy to consume without the mess! The Katsu Don was yummy as well- katsu chicken, rice, peas, and egg in a bowl, YUM! 

Although, I found our tab to be a little expensive compared to what I usually pay for back home (San Diego)... But overall, this place is great! I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Good honest sushi from Hawaii. Sushi Yamaguchi was one of the only sushi places in Vegas that have been to where they actually seasoned their edamame. One of the more memorable rolls I had was called the Black Fire roll, eel, and cream cheese inside with spicy tuna outside. Garnished with scallions and eel sauce. A great combination of sweet and spicy, crunchy and creamy. The roll itself was enough to almost fill me up. The restaurant sees a good number of regulars during the lunch hours."}
