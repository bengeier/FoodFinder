{"text":"I recently attended this restaurant/bar grand opening and since then I have been back way too many times to count. I have now found my new favorite spot to hang out after work! The Park is wonderful!! On our first of many trips we sat outside on their patio! So comfy!! I think my backside immediately molded itself into the seat of the chair!

Their food....very delectable and very fresh. I love calamari and this one of the best I have ever had. The seasoning was so good and the tomato sauce was hot and spicy.  The Brazilian steak salad is among their best and their grilled chicken sandwich stuffed with caprese salad and special dressing makes me feel all tingly inside!! But the best of them all is the lobster mac n' cheese....that's right .....lobster mac n' cheese!! It's like manna from the heavens!! So much lobster meat it will make you cry!! (WARNING: You be addicted to this place once you try this). Check this place out!!

Tip: all you service industry people out there....make sure to go in on Thurs....discount specials just for you!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Definitely a hidden gem by Fremont street. It has awesome decor and you gotta check out the bathrooms. I loved the simplicity of the menu. Two drink menus and one food menu. Short, sweet and to the point, just how I love it. It has great happy hour and the drinks were on the friendly side if you catch my drift."}
