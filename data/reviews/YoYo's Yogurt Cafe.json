{"text":"Possibly the worst yogurt and experience i've had in my life. WARNING: do not buy from here!! 1) the yogurt is sub par. Mind you, i've been to countless self-serve yogurt joints across north america, and this one is by far the worst. 2) the selection is very minimal. only a few choices in yogurt and sorbets 3) the owner is rude, disrespectful and doesn't know how to interact with customers. Instead of taking responsibility for his awful yogurt and customer service, he blames the customer and refuses to help. He also creates a scene and gets defensive and chose to embarrass me in front of other customers.   I will never purchase their over priced, disgusting yogurt again. I warn you- do not waste your money or time with this place"}
{"text":"The yogurt tastes disgusting. My friends and I who have gone here have vowed never to come back and to only visit Yogurtys and Menchies who have significantly better taste.  All the flavours here taste fake and like they were made with artificial sweetener. I live in the building upstairs and would still drive the extra 15 minutes to Menchies for much better flavours. Don't waste your money!!!!!! The girls who work here are nice and thats why I give it a 1. Otherwise it is a 0."}
{"text":"It's ok. It will be a hit in summer. I have to mention the girls working there: very pleasant and welcoming, they invited us to sample everything. And we did! Some flavors taste better than others. Some actually tasted weird. My best experience with yogurt was the \"Red Mango\" in NYC. But I like it for being so conveniently close and serving pretty decent yogurt. Make sure you pair it with the right toppings that compliment the flavor."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of frozen yogurt, so when I saw a post online about this location, I got a bit excited. They have an amazing selection of toppings which you can go crazy with. The location is clean, has a good vibe, and is perfect for dessert after an evening out in sauga or event square one. The best thing about yoyo's is the variety of specialty flavours they have. Anything from non fat strawberry shortcake, banana split, aloha pi√±a colada, and the list goes on. The staff is friendly and can recommend some awesome flavour combos. My fav local yogurt spot to date"}
{"text":"Rude staff. Went in to get a frozen yogurt. Didn't like a flavor so I decided on another flavor. After I paid for my yogurt (which was overpriced as hell), the staff came after me outside of the shop and said I needed to pay for the frozen yogurt I did not like. And when I said no he said can you pay for half? What kind of owner allows their staff to chase after customers to pay for flavors that taste awful. He then proceeded to tell me to never come back to the store. It's okay there are many other BETTER frozen yogurt places around mississauga that are not willing to call the cops if you do not like a flavor. Their flavors taste artifical anyways. Haha for being banned from a frozen yogurt shop."}
{"text":"We heard about this from a friend and decided to check it out due to its conveniently close location.  The interior was clean and looked nice and welcoming. They even have a few chairs and tables outside if you want to eat outside.  I had Tart and Red Velvet. She had Blueberry and Red Velvet. We both enjoyed our frozen yogurts. We also noticed that this location also provided smoothies where you can serve yourself any different combination of yogurt flavors and add in some toppings that arent jelly or hard candy. They would then blend it together into a drink. That'll be the next thing i'll try when i go back.  If you're in the area, check out YoYo's."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. It's a little on the pricey side but over all it's a good location and atmosphere. Im only using cash here from now on because they've charged me when I used my debt card that \"didn't go through\" then I paid in cash. Therefore they charged me twice for this purchase. Their card machine always seems to be finicky, so save yourself the hassle and just pay cash. Also, they're hard to get into contact with so I'm not sure how long this problem will take to resolve."}
{"text":"I found this to not taste like real yogurt. It tasted like chemicals and fake ingredients. Disappointing for the price, it was expensive."}
{"text":"As Spring is approaching, I figured I would indulge myself on some frozen yogurt.  Please keep in mind that I've never been to a Menchie's and my fro-yo experiences come mostly from California.    What I like:  -Self serve - get to choose whatever you want.   -0.55/oz is reasonable -Yogurt is tasty  What I don't like: -While this is prime location and right across from Celebration Square, it is not the most convenient for drivers as parking is only free for 1/2 hour.    Final judgement: It's frozen yogurt and self serve, great for kids and great during the summer when you visit Celebration Square."}
{"text":"The staff here is so stingy with their samples, it makes you uncomfortable asking to try flavors before buying them. Even though I live nearby and have a 15% coupon from the building, I would recommend going to another establishment like Menchies who trust their customers enough to give them sample cups in hand.  Only good flavor: mango sorbet but really, I would like mango-everything from anywhere)"}
{"text":"This is by FAR the worst yogurt store I have EVER been in my life.  I had a half cup of yogurt, and the guy behind the counter charged me $7CAD.   Clearly the scale he had at the register was rigged.  He had a big smile when he asked for money.  This place is a scam. I want to kick my own behind for not walking out when he cheated me.   I walked in to the establishment at 1:20PM, and there was no customers at all;that should have been a giant clue.  The taste was C minus, a very mediocre quality.  The value offered was F minus.    This place should go out of business.    Don't believe the pictures you see on other people's reviews, especially Rick M, who is probably the owner of the store pretending to be a customer reviewer.  When I walked in the toppings on the counter did not look fresh and yummy like the pictures.  It is probably because no one goes to this lousy store.    When Yogurt business became fashionable, any Tom, Dick, and Harry who had some spare money got in to the business, some without any thought or care for the business or the customers they are serving. YoYo's Yogurt Cafe is a copy of some store name in US likely.  Anyhow, this store ruined my frozen yogurt experience and I hope I can find a good yogurt store, which is not easy these days.  BB"}
{"text":"It was a super hot day and froyo was the next best thing to have. I picked this froyo place as I saw it was new and in the Square One area. When we walked in, we were greeted quickly and the girl helped us with tasting any flavours we were interested in.  I tried both the sorbets since I cannot take diary. They had the peach and cherry sorbet. I really liked the peach one and I thought the cherry tasted like cherry popsicle (not my preference). They have various different flavours to choose from so do try them out! At the end I chose the peach sorbet and a little bit of the tart yogurt.  Now for the TOPPINGS, they had so many to choose from. The toppings table was sort of the middle of the store, which for some reason I liked this set up more than other froyo places. I chose mainly fresh fruits- mango, strawberries and kiwi- and added 2 pieces of reese's pieces. The fruits were sweet and made the froyo super refreshing! Next time I plan to try their smoothie since they also had cups available to make our own drinks- you can also add protein for a little extra cost. We also got a 15% off discount on our treats since we checked-in on Yelp. The girl at the cash also told us we could get a dollar off if we signed up on their website or something- will sure keep that in mind next time!!  Note: Parking is free for 30mins in front of the store."}
{"text":"I'v been here a couple of times already and when i heard about a Fro-yo place in this area i was glad because there aren't many in the square one area.   I feel like this place is alright but i wouldnt be excited to come back here, I\"ll tell you why. The location is kinda small and usually only one person working at a time and they are kind of on top of you to the point where its uncomfortable, and if you want a sample you have to ask for one. The Fro-yo itself in my opinion is kinda weird, it tends to melt so fast. The flavours are great, don't get me wrong. They have flavours like red velvet and birthday cake, which is awesome but who wants Fro-yo if it melts fast?? Also I had checked in here and i wanted to redeem the 15% off deal, but when i told the girl who was working she had no clue what i was talking about. Even though i had showed her the deal on my phone, she said she had to call her boss and ask which was kind of a hassle and seemed like a bother. For only approximately about the tax off, didnt seem worth the bother. The toppings seemed fresh and are yummy i must say...lychee, chocolate chip cookie dough and cheescake pieces....  Overall i would only come back if i was in the area and absolutly craving Fro-yo to the max to the point that i couldn't wait anymore lol. However my experience could be different then others, try it for yourself."}
{"text":"There aren't many froyo places around here so I was excited when I heard that this place was opening so close to home, right across from SQ1. The location is great, walking distance from the library, YMCA and Celebration Square; great when with families on warm summer days.   They have a variety of flavours and change them up every few weeks. My favourite is the Red Velvet and good ol Chocolate and Vanilla mix. What was a first for me is the variety of toppings that they offer though - I've never seen so many choices before! Lot of new things I haven't tasted .. I love the fresh fruit though when I have trouble choosing.   Overall I have to say it's the best froyo I've had and I've made many stops back after first discovering earlier this year!"}
{"text":"I found YoYo's to be a healthier and cheaper alternative to popular yogurt cafes like Menchies and Yogurty's. Place was nice, clean and well kept. Vast variety of toppings. I really appreciate how YoYo's displays the amount of calories and grams of sugar above their yogurts. As for the yogurt itself; I got the shortcake flavour and to my surprise it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet."}
{"text":"Lots of variety for yogurt flavours and toppings so they get 2 stars but they lose 3 stars because the toppings don't look fresh and the yogurt was all melted like milk in no time. Not worth it. We prefer Menchies for sure but we just happened to be in the area of Celebration Square. I don't think we will be back."}
