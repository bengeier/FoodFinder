{"text":"Great atmosphere and décor? Check. Great company? Check. Great...yeah, okay, that's about it.  East! seriously looks way too pretty. It's quite deceiving. I love Thai food, but what I really love is authentic Thai food and this just wasn't it. My boyfriend and I shared the veggie spring rolls to start which were only average. I then had their original pad thai with chicken while he had the curry pad thai with chicken. Again, disappointingly average on both accounts. The sauce on my pad thai was particularly odd. It was actually decently tasty, but way too far from what pad thai sauce should taste like in my opinion - it was almost like a red, sweet and sour sauce, rather than being remotely peanut-flavoured!  Considering the stylish vibe of the restaurant (and its great location if you plan on seeing a movie afterwards), the prices were quite reasonable and the portion sizes were also decent. But would I plan a repeat appearance? Nope, there are many other nice Thai restaurants in the city I'd rather give my business too!"}
{"text":"I can't deny that this place knows how to dress itself - very stylish decor with a romantic lighting and in a prime location to boot. It is always a treat to walk pass it to get a glimpse of its interior, but that's pretty much as far as I'll go now.  The spring rolls were something to be desired and also made me sick almost immediately. And at the expense of sounding too overly analytical, it seems like this restaurant takes its Asian cuisine as a gimmick - like the objective in the business plan was simply \"Fancy Thai restaurant\".  Sad to say, my experience there was a forgettable one (I can't even remember what I had as an entree) though I do remember fighting the urge to regurgitate the next day due to the aforementioned spring rolls.  There are far better options out there than East!"}
{"text":"This is a tasty Thai restaurant with dark lighting that's great for an evening meal. It has a central location near OCAD and AGO, but it may be a bit pricey for students wanting a cheap lunch between classes. I've tried the veggie Pad Thai and vegetable and tofu soup; both of them were delicious but not astounding. I'm not a fan of their tight seating arrangements that leaves you a foot away from other people and their conversations. This atmosphere could taint an otherwise nice dinner with a friend or lover. My service was great and the food was served promptly."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I was here a few years ago and remember loving it.  But wow, we ate here for dinner and the spring rolls and rice noodles both tasted like it was made in the morning/stale/microwaved for us.  I can imagine paying half the price for way better food in chinatown!"}
{"text":"I definitely felt more positive about this restaurant than the couple of reviews I just read.  The place is very well decorated with minimalist asian influences, the service is friendly, the portions were large and very well priced, BUT the food was up and down.    I came here for lunch with my sister after a rough day of xmas shopping.  We got in around 3 and were given the brunch menu.  Apparently they serve lunch and brunch until 4pm (recession much?).  My sister got the brunch special of appetizer (enoki tom yum soup- this was very flavorful, almost a little to sweet tasting), entree (house pad thai- yes I agree it was strangely red and not authentic tasting), and coconut crepes (for someone who doesn't like desserts, I thought these were yummy and large enough to share).   I got the beef curry pad thai, recommended by the server, it was decently yummy.  We also got house spring rolls to share.  The portions were huge and we had almost an entire meal left over.  Total price not including tax and tip= $25. Not too shabby.  The food is mediocre, but I would come back for the decor, service, and warmth (it's FREEEZING in Toronto!)"}
{"text":"PRO'S: Good vegan pad thai.... in fact, they have a whole section on the menu that is strictly vegan. The staff is friendly. They have soju.    CON'S: I guess this isn't their fault but i fell down the stairs. so embarrassing! They are affiliated with Spring Rolls, the worst restaurant on earth!!"}
{"text":"I had two hours free during the busiest week of my life, a company car that overruled every pesky parking metre of the over gentrified downtown streets--which had me laughing hard at those odious parking enforcement jackals, and I was dressed to the nines with the taxpayers' money to fill my belly.  So where shall I lunch?  The only acknowledgement of existence I had of this place was once spotting a television host in here during my first visit to Queen Street through the window. It looks posh enough from the exterior, but far too contemporary for my tastes. But so it goes, I was alone..and I wanted to park my vehicle at a busy place during the weekday and have the parking assholes unable to exercise their very small..minuscule authority.   The restaurant was nearly empty, and it boggles the mind why the Maitre'D sat me by the counter in the very front of the house. The décor seemed cheap. Like IKEA cheap. I figured it was an Asian eatery, but had no idea it was Thai. One should understand, the word \"Thai\" in North America for restaurants is really just a substitute for 'lacking in variety'. I've never been to a 'Thai' restaurant on this continent where the menu was very interesting. I would be angry if I were from Thailand and had my rich Culture reduced to shrimp-noodles and fried-rice. They also had dim sum here...this can't be right?  The staff here were fairly sharply dressed, well groomed, young, and all appeared to be UofT students. Not in an unprofessional way or anything. They were just young. They seemed to be occupied the entire time, with only four tables in the whole restaurant? What were they doing? Despite the location, EAST! was rather spacious, well lit, clean, and I didn't have to wait very long for my food to arrive. Since I had all this free time, I figured I'd order a good portion. But when I saw the prices for the dim sum I had to mentally count the cash I had on me. $4.00 for four pieces of dumplings? Were they steaming it in truffles?!  Everything else was reasonably priced, but the dim sum was just offensive. Chinatown is not a block away, where's the justification for this pretension? I ordered the most expensive dim sum dish to see what is so special about the siu mai here to be priced at $1.00 each. Couldn't tell ya! I also got this fried rice pyramid thing with shrimps I think. What is the significance of pyramids with regards to Thailand? Springs roll, $5.00 for two. Why don't you just point a gun to head?  The prices for what go as 'snacks' in actual Asia are held to the level of ransom demands in this restaurant! These spring rolls better promise to love me long time afterwards.   The food just isn't very good, and the wait staff weren't very engaging. The décor gave off the vibe as if this were some kind of a uptown karaoke bar, and the location is just all wrong for what they're selling. I don't buy it. But of course I did, because my bill came. I got out of there within an hour, and headed back to my hotel with an hour to spare...so I can do nothing.   EAST!  No. East Coast maybe."}
{"text":"Ended up at East! on a whim - should have yelped it first. The restaurant was quite busy but we were fortunate to score a table in the glassed in store front that places you right on the edge of the sidewalk. A perfect place to people watch which is always fun on Queen West and even better as it was St. Patrick's Day making the crowd slightly larger, greener and more intoxicated than usual.   We were a little concerned from the get go as they had no Sapporo on tap (had to go with the 7.95 can) and were also out of bubbles for the Thai bubble tea (which was an odd concoction of tea, perhaps mango juice, evaporated milk and who knows what else). Anytime a restaurant is out of menu standards it makes me wonder about the overall management of the operation.  Ordered the chili grilled squid, spring rolls and shrimp dumplings as apps. The dumplings were sweet and delicate but accompanied by a hot chili sauce with a dollop of mustard that completely overpowered the flavour. The soy based sauce that came with the non-descript spring rolls was a much better dip. Grilled squid okay but nothing special. Shared a couple of noodle dishes, veggie and tofu pad thai (sweet and tangy but not very pad thai-y) and  the Shanghai noodles and seafood which lacked much seafood and was very bland. Service was pleasant but irregular - where I come from, \"be right back with your appetizers\" generally means a few minutes not 20 but perhaps given the rabbit warren nature of some Toronto buildings the kitchen is up on Dundas somewhere or the microwave was on the fritz.  From my perspective, not worthwhile if you are in the area as East's \"Asian fusion\" manages only to fuse Asian styles into blandness. There is better Asian to be had in the area. I would have given only two stars but my less adventurous dining companions were quite happy with the meal and gave it four so I compromised. In my mind East! is up-scale mall food court which fits right in with the hip-replacement mall-like retail world that Queen West has mostly become."}
{"text":"This is a nice, safe bet for reasonably priced, tasty food on Queen St. The size of the place pretty much guarantees you a seat and the inside décor is pretty stylish - definitely fits in with the a Queen St vibe.   They have a pretty large menu so there are lots of options, they have a full bar, and they have a number of dishes which are completely VEGAN (in addition to a full menu with meat and fish dishes). Those of you who prefer your thai food without pesky fish sauce, this place is for you. It's certainly not the most authentic thai food but it is tasty and I've had luck asking for substitutions. The food is well priced and the service has been pretty quick in my experience."}
{"text":"After a long day with the girls, we had to decide where to eat and since the original choice was closed for a private party, I tossed in either Crispy Roll http://www.yelp.ca/biz/crispy-roll-toronto#hrid:AUB_dxKeEyUr3VYoX2iNlw, my standby favourite eatery on Queen St W or East.  The deciding factor for East was that they would have a much nicer and WARM washroom (and they did - hurrah!).  The modern dark decor of the restaurant received very positive reviews from everyone.  We were on the second floor and it very quickly became clear that 2 servers desperately needed more hands to help (or shall I say, 1 and half servers?  Though nice, our actual server was rarely seen, and when she did show up, strolled very leisurely along... ladeela... yes, I did ask for hot water about 20 minutes ago?  yes, I would still like it, please and thank you...)  I've always been a fan of pretend fusion Asian fare, it's a bit of an odd quirk.  My friend and I had the Korean Kalbi and tiger skewer dinner, which I found quite delicious, though absolutely inauthentically 'Korean' and the sauce was a bit heavy and too sweet.  My friend was a bit less forgiving and declared the ribs to be too bitter.  Another friend had some fried rice dish that could have come from a food court.  Someone else had the pad thai and found it so sour and tomatoey she couldn't finish it and proceeded to tell the server to recommend to the chef how they could improve it.  All in all, a nice place to visit, great for groups, not the best food and the 3 stars say it all - it's a-ok."}
{"text":"My last night in Toronot for the UFC 129 weekend, and we were drained, it was late, and craving a restaurant to sit down and enjoy friends' company, a good atmosphere, and something that was going to be consistent with my new veggie lifestyle...   I turned to my trusty yelp (i'm becoming a huge fan because of my frequncy of travel- both to learn of new spots as well as share the ones i've found) and utilized the open now checkbox as well as the neighborhood one and searched thai food.. East came up near the top in that selection, and although it didn't have the best reviews, my friend I was staying with suggested we try it..  It was listed with $$ which I think was quite accurate in hindsight; although it was still very affordable our bbill ended up being about $150 for four people. I'm sure that had to do with the four or five bottles of sake my friends dove into.  We started off the meal with fried calamari which was pretty standard; it was the accompanying sauce that was super spicy and it's after taste was resonating in my mouth till my entree arrived. The menu was HUGE and I was almost at a loss on what to order, tell you the truth. It was an asian fusion mix and boasted an entire veggie section.  I ordered the tofu with asparagus, which actually was a dish that included a ton of other vegetables. I got a side of coconut rice, and after seeing this was actually a desert, ordered a jasmine rice too. Of course I ate the coconut rice first, lol.. My girlfriend ordered the famous chicken pad thai which I tasted sans chicken; it had such a noticeable tomato base. I was a huge fan of my dish, but hers was below average. My other friend had the tempura fried cheesecake for dessert. I sampled that too, and it was pretty yummy.  Overall, I loved the atmosphere on this restaurant. The decor was extremely nice and pleasant to be in as well as converse in. The fact that it was open till 11pm on a Sunday night was definitely scoring points with me. The food was pretty good, but not above average. I would definitely eat there again, though.. Wish there was such a thing as half a star?? 3.5 stars for me..."}
{"text":"Tried their new AYCE menu and really impressed. They have an excellent selection and the quality is way above average for AYCE places. They have dim sum, lots of Thai dishes, sushi and sashimi (they have unagi and hamachi) and Chinese items. I've eaten at more AYCE places than I like to admit to and these guys have got it right! I will def be back, as it's now my default AYCE place."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is it's original namesake: the spring rolls. When they renamed it East!, it took away the only thing it had going for it.  Every other thing I've had here was just bad. Surrounded by so many other superior alternatives on this stretch of Queen West, there really is no reason to go here. Ginger, a couple doors down, for instance, is half the price and twice as good."}
{"text":"I had gone to East a bunch of time for lunch with co-workers and ex-coworkers. It's a little more money than a place like Aji Sai, but I still think its good value. I would definitely recommend the all you can eat lunch. The kitchen/hot food is what they are best at. The spring rolls, the deep fried shrimp, the MASSIVE gyozas, the cheese dumplings, and the siu mai are all my favourite. The sushi is below par, but I recommend just not ordering a ton of that. Overall, a place like Aji Sai is better, but if you want a change of pace or want just delicious dumplings and spring rolls then I'd recommend this place for the all you can eat lunch."}
{"text":"This is not about the food...the food is yummy....it's the same at every Spring Rolls and East in the city - I like the consistency. This is about the location and business as a whole.   I was there a few years ago, in March. We had just been hit by a late season snow storm and it was the next day. I went in to pick up an order I had placed for lunch. I paid and was on my way to use the washroom, when I FELL down the flight of stairs because it was slippery. I had winter boots on that I had wiped off when I walked through the door, but the slate tile had not been cleaned up. There was no sign and no hand rail! Oh ya, and NO ONE CAME TO SEE IF I WAS OK!   I ended up getting up, making it to the bathroom, wind knocked out of me, black bruise already formed on my hip and what I thought was a broken arm. I some how made it up the stairs and told the manager what happened and again NO ONE ASKED IF I WAS OK! I spent the rest of the day at Toronto General in x-rays and the ER seeing if I was broken. Thank God I wasn't, but I was in a sling for the next few days and badly bruised for a month. I had to go to a massage therapist to move the fluid that had built up in the fall location.   I filled out an accident report and NO ONE CALLED ME FROM THE COMPANY! NO ONE OFFERED ANY COMPENSATION AND NO ONE SAID SORRY!"}
{"text":"Had lovely apps like the spring rolls but the sushi left me wanting more... not as fresh as I would expect."}
