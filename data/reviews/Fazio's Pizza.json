{"text":"Queremos destacar la atencion muy amable del personal. Adquirimos la pizza barbacoa de patatas fritas y pollo y ademas de parecernos muy original, estaba muy rica."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for!  We got a medium and it was more than enough for 4 + leftovers.  Really good crust, sauce, toppings (cappicola).   There area ton of pizza places around here, but I'm not sure I will bother trying any others!"}
{"text":"I really like their white pizza. In case you are like I was when I moved to Pittsburgh from CA (I had no idea what a white pizza was) it has: olive oil, ricotta, garlic, cheese and tomato. It is delicious with sausage or pepperoni on top. I was sad their prices went up a  little bit recently but they are still worth it."}
{"text":"If you want greasy, cheesy pepperoni pizza, this is THE place in Bloomfield, in my opinion. It is that gooey, pepperoni-y, mouthwateringly delicious kind of pizza. If you want a good salad, this is not your place. But for classic, greasy pizza -- Fazio's is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I've gotten pizza from here twice and it's been consistently good. The crust is thinner than your typical Pittsburgh pizza and it's a little chewy. Since I'm a fan of thin-crust, I thought it was great! The sauce is a little tangy, a little sweet and not at all chunky. My favorite thing about this pizza was definitely the cheese...I loved the flavor and the consistency.   This is my new go-to pizza place! It's convenient (they deliver) and it is also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza on 8/13 a  Saturday evening  it was  a very hot day so why cook  I'll get a pizza  It was around 8 25 pm the pizza arrived at 9:10pm let me just say the $18.00 I paid was a waste of my hard earned money .the pizza was cold the cheese looked like a pizza that sat out all night on your kitchen table.I called the shop for 2 days and got no answer.they lost my business and  I was a steady customer  alice"}
{"text":"Fazio's has a secret: their Sicilian squares are pretty decent--one of the closest squares I could find comparable to Brooklyn square, which is hard to find in the east end. their normal pie is ok but the Sicilian is leagues better. 2 cuts will only set you back about $5, a great deal."}
{"text":"I've eaten pizza, hoagies, and calzones here and they've all been solid (especially like the chicken parm sub).  Standard italian fare, but their good deals and prices make it one of my go to places when I'm too tired/lazy to cook.  For anyone who lives on this side of Bloomfield its convenience makes it at least worth trying."}
{"text":"Hawaiian pizza tasted like cardboard. Definitely do not recommend. 2 stars because delivery was fast and girl on the phone was very pleasant."}
{"text":"10/10 for the friendliness and welcoming-ness of this place. Awesome bald guy who worked the register offered me a cup of water while waiting and we talked about the olympics for several minutes while i waited for my pizza. Pizza itself was delicious - and im from Long Island / hard to please. Was really greasy and that is a drawback for me but a little napkin dabbing did the trick! Wish i could order from them again but they dont deliver to my area!"}
{"text":"I love the food and always have. I would like to give a five star rating but unfortunately i can't. I ordered a pizza and hogie at half time durning the Steelers game. It took almost two hours to be delivered. I don't live that far away. I get it that they want to watch the game . I have worked and still do have to work during Steelers games. But the customer comes first ! If that is not the case for them then they should not offer delivery service durning games. We were greatly disappointed. It was cold as well when delivered. I did call and was told it was out for delivery. Even after that it took another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"First trip was wonderful. Wedgie was wet but that's just what I wanted. Wife's hoggie was a big hit with her and the kid. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Top 3 pizza in Pittsburgh, the crust and cheese are excellent"}
{"text":"Ha, I was just going to write \"totally solid neighborhood pizza joint\" which I see someone below has written. It is! Just walked in for the first time and got a slice of red sauce/pepperoni and white sauce/tomato, both tasty. They'd heated them up so the crust was crunchy.  Cheese blend on the white pizza was great. Reasonably priced, too.    A few tables to eat in, slices to go, also orders/delivery.  While I was there, I heard someone placing an intricate phone order (like the way Sally from When Harry Met Sally... ordered food) with items like \"well done fries,\" and they seemed quite accommodating.  I will be back, especially if this winter is as bad as the last one."}
{"text":"Love love love Fazios as our neighborhood pizza place! Be ready to know what you want and order straightforward, they're not rude just the type of ship they run. Great lunch special of two slices and a drink $5! I have had wedges, salad, wings, hoagie and pizza and continue to order these over and over. It's a lil greasy but that's what makes it good! Right??"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! These guys know how to make a good pie. I'm moving soon and I'm sad to be leaving this place behind. Customer service - EXCELLENT, the food - AMAZING and DELICIOUS. They hustle to serve as many as possible in a day and they do it well. It's hard to find great service and food like this! Love the thin crust, the ingredients are always so fresh, and the time quoted is always accurate. If you haven't tried them, you need to...and if you have, visit them again!!"}
{"text":"Was in area and decided to stop in to try their pizza. I ordered the lunch special(2 slices and a drink for $5) . Still trying to finding really good pizza in Pittsburgh. Overall the pizza wasn't bad. None of the ingredients stood out. Good basic pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place. Easily one of the best places in Pittsburgh. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I usually order ranch and that's never in the order when I get it."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best hand tossed thin crust pizza in Pittsburgh.  The wings are awesome if you like them crispy and sauce on the side like I do.  Hoagies are awesome too.  Everyone working is always friendly when myself and coworkers stop by for lunch.  They also have a nice little patio area in the back that's quiet and almost makes me forget I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Fazio's is the BEST pizza delivery there is. Period. When my husband and I moved out of Bloomfield, our only sadness was that we would no longer be able to order from Fazio's.   Fazio's is truly the best Pizzaria we have come across, and that is saying a lot as my husband's father is from Italy... So we know a good pizza when we see one!   The pizza at Fazio's is greasy and salty, just the way we like it. The crust is thin, and the sauce is NOT sweet.   Pizza perfection."}
{"text":"The pizza and hoagies here are absolutely amazing. I do, however, recommend picking it up as delivery can sometimes take a bit long. Understandably so, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I tried Fazio's for the first time. We live 5 minutes away, so I was hoping that the pizza would be hot when it arrived. Instead, it was barely warm. I had chicken, mushrooms, and black olives on mine. The mushrooms looked and tasted like canned mushrooms. They were rubbery and not very flavorful. Fresh mushrooms would have been so much better. The chicken tasted like processed chicken strips. I was disappointed, and will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"A) Great staff! Everyone is super friendly! B) Buffalo chicken pizza is outstanding. I was skeptical at first with the French fries on it, but it was amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, but a little on the salty side. However, it is one of the slower delivery services we use for Shadyside.  Delivery was recently 20 minutes late on a day in the middle of the week and the guy on the phone was quite rude about it. Apparently, only \"John\" is capable of helping to resolve issues; you'd have to call back when he is working."}
{"text":"We had the BEST pizza today from Fazio's!! They were very polite on the phone as usual and it was delivered to us in Lawrenceville on time. And it was hot when we received it! It was cooked perfectly, just golden brown without any burn spots in the crust. It also had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. (We don't like a lot of sauce on our pizza). 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were searching for a simple, hole in the wall kinda pizza place. Fazio's was perfect! The staff was super nice and the food was good.   It was hard to choose from all the fantastic sounding starters but we finally decided on fried zucchini and it was great. We ordered a white pizza with a bunch of toppings which was delicious. The crust was seriously some of the best I've ever had. Plus they have Coke (boo Pepsi) and free refills.   My friends and I could not have been more pleased with our experience here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the provolone hoagie and bacon cheese fries. They were piping hot when they came and were delicious. Fazio's has some awesome Italian dressing for their subs. I ordered my food for delivery and it was there in 30 minutes as most places can take over an hour sometimes. I have lived in this area for 3 years and regret not trying Fazio's sooner! I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with delivery time, though I tend to order on the early side, 6pm. Pizza is good but very salty."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was MUCH better. Over the past couple of years though, the quality and freshness have been replaced by grease. Nothing special at all, and the older guys have been over heard making remarks about their customers to each other. Not a winning strategy with so many other pizza joints around this 'hood."}
{"text":"Good white pizza and its nice to have an option for sicilian. Good lunch specials, just wish they would offer white slices. Definitely above average pizza shop."}
{"text":"Really solid neighborhood pizza. Definitely the best delivery pizza I've had in pittsburgh. More east coast style than pittsburgh style, which is a-ok in my book, not having had the pleasure of being weaned on aiellos.  Thinner crust w/ some chew & char and not too much provolone in the cheese. And not too much cheese for that matter (I'm lookin at you minellos.)"}
{"text":"I would say that Fazio's is probably a small step ahead of Pesaro's. The pizza is a smidge crispier though delivery always results in a less crispy pizza than when you eat-in. I also like the steak hoagies. Service is quick and prompt and the food arrives piping hot. As others have noted - totally solid neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! I'm here once a week at least. I drove all the way from out by the airport to pickup delivery once. When i showed up, they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. They even told me to check my phone as if I could have called another location, which there is only one, so not sure why they suggested that.   Not only did I know for a fact that I ordered from the right number bc I order once a week, but I know for a fact that the man telling me I never ordered was actually the one who took my order! Come on, guys. You think I don't recognize your voices by now? I only come in once a week. Needless to say, being a little miffed over the situation, I haven't returned, but boy is their pizza good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in my neighborhood. I could eat here every day. Yum."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add that the delivery experience is just as awesome as the take out/self pick up experience.  He said 30-40 minutes and it arrived on time, hot and scrumptious.  Love this place!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and nice staff. Pizza is crispy and delicious. Wings are Alonso really good and covered in sauce."}
{"text":"Always on the search for great spots that will deliver to Polish Hill. Fazio's Pizza stood out to me because their prices were a little lower than other places I've tried. I was able to get a large pizza with mushrooms and a dozen wings for about $20 and I was satisfied. The wings were VERY saucy, and the hot sauce was just hot enough for me to handle, nothing crazy.   I'll definitely give them another go and look forward to trying some new menu items."}
{"text":"To preface this: I rarely will make a Yelp review, but I had to make an exception for Fazio's. This is without a doubt my favorite pizza in the Bloomfield / Lawrenceville area. Perfect NY style slices with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Crust is top notch. We usually just get plain so not too sure about the toppings, but regular cheese is divine."}
{"text":"Fazio's is my fave takeout pizza joint in the burgh. Their white pizza is sooo good and that crust. We usually order a white pizza and salad for delivery and sadly the delivery man now recognizes me. NOT what you want happening. Really, that's all I have gotten from Fazio's becacause it is so good I never want to order anything else! Delivery is fast, service is friendly, food is cheap/yummy! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"We've tried pizza shop after pizza shop after pizza shop (yes, sadly, we actually that much pizza) since moving into the area and our quest for that one place that's worth a second taste may have finally come to an end!  I can't speak for delivery quality, but each time I've gone in to for my pick-up order, I was greeted by the incredibly friendly guy - the owner, I presume - at the counter. I love shops with that neighborhoody feel. He knew everyone who came in to pick their orders up, and is really easy to chat with. If I was rating Fazio's on customer service it would be 5 easily, but the food is delicious, too!  We've only had their cheese pizza and chicken parm hoagie, but both were excellent. The pizza crust is really thin, and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese. As other reviewers stated, if you want a traditional, greasy pie, this is one of the best places to sate your craving in Pittsburgh. Despite the thin crust, it's never been undercooked and soggy, and we haven't had to deal with a burnt crust, either. As for the hoagie...their rolls are delicious and really help make the sandwich. I can't wait to try some of their other hoagies, but for now, the chicken parm might be hard to pass up for me.  Overall, Fazio's is the complete package for a pizza shop. Great customer service, a neighborhood vibe, and delicious, reasonably-priced food. You really can't' go wrong! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! We're from California trying to find the best pizza and it was great!!! John, the owner, made the experience wonderful! Thanks for the shirts...we'll wear them with pride!!!"}
{"text":"The pie crust was nice and thin. The onions cut just perfectly and the sausage crumbled well. The hot Italian sausage hoagie was delicious !"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Crispy thin crust and quick delivery for an independent place. Haven't had anything other than pizza but that's because it's sooooo good. Black and gold pizza is a must."}
{"text":"Great family owned pizzeria two blocks from Children's Hospital. They will deliver for free or it is a nice walk if you need some air and time outside. We ordered small cheese pizza, half meatball hoagie and garden salad. Pizza was good and the meatballs...WOW! You can tell they're homemade not frozen. Will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. My husband and I just moved to this side of town and felt like some pizza. Since now Fiori's is so far away we have to find a new favorite over here..  So maybe we should have ordered the pizza? Maybe that's the only good thing here which gives this place its misleading 4 stars? We got a cheese calzone and wings.  The calzone was completely flat.. the dough was so thin it was translucent, when I poked it I could see a bubble of liquid moving underneath the top dough.. okay so this liquid is the most baffling thing I've ever seen in my food. We cut the calzone into 4 slices and like this liquid, not fat/grease but it was like literal water, the whole inside filling was soaked and overflowing with this water liquid.. the calzone was plain cheese (didn't order mushrooms since they use canned, so nothing in there should cause water..) uhh. Also there was a slight pink tint to the ricotta cheese and basically the entire gloopy liquidy glop of filling, it was all tinted pink. But we got no sauce, sauce on the side. And none of the fillings have ever dyed my food pink so this was just so weird and gross.. so many things wrong I can't even.  I thought maybe I can at least the wings. Husband goes \"these are like walmart wings\" and yes they sure are. There is a laughable amount of meat on the bones. The wings seem to be battered and fried, a LONG time ago, and by the time they arrived they were 100% soggy all the way through. This thick soggy layer of some kind of cardboardy bleh.  Like what is this place doing.. I wish more than anything that we had used a card to order but unfortunately we paid cash, and we feel literally robbed of the $30 we paid for this garbage..  Like I can't understand how a business exists and is still open and has 4 stars when their food is so absolutely awful?? I feel so misled by yelp, this is pretty rare.  Save your money! Swear I've had a lot of pizza and calzones from a lot of places, this is nottttttt what it should be. Really wish I could have my $30 back."}
{"text":"A solid neighborhood pizza joint. Decent pizza, hoagies are really good too. Pretty quick delivery and the employees are always nice. We try new places and always come back to Fazio's."}
{"text":"What is up with these highly rated bloomfield pizza joints?  I ordered an XL regular (not white, not sicilian) pizza with pepperoni and green peppers.  Delivery was fine, but the pizza was terrible!!  The green peppers had a super off-taste that permeated the whole pizza.  Everyone agreed that it was very sub-par.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing off the menu, but after that experience I don't think I'm willing to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"I love it here. I know that sometimes people think that the staff is rude but I really think that they are just no nonsense. The food is good and they are fast. I always think that when I go in the are nice and cheerful. But I do work and live pretty close and I will say that I have came here more often than maybe I should admit. They even have an outside patio that is nice in the summer to go out and eat in the shade. They have a few tables out there so you can bring some friends and have a good time. Family owned, local. You really just need to try this place out.   My favorite is just their lunch specials. You go in and get two slices and a drink. Yum. My favorite topping is the banana peppers. Yummy. But then again anything on a cheesy crust is good in my book. The crust here is so good. It is crispy and thin and it makes me very very happy.   My other favorite lunch special is the 1/2 sub and fries combo. I like the Italian sub with extra tomatoes and onions. Fazio's has some awesome Italian dressing that they whip up and I always ask for more on the side to dip. Wait...I also like their wing special. Seriously, maybe I like to eat everything on the menu! The wings are super crispy and really good. They have a lot of meat on them so you will not be disappointed.   This is another awesome neighborhood pizza shop. Really just try this place out. I promise that the staff is not scary as some other people wrote about. Come and enjoy a lunch special or just order a full pie. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I had purchased bagels and donuts for my new daylight \"colleagues,\" but I didn't want to omit my former evening shift comrades, so 3 large pizzas acted as my going-away gift to them.   A half an hour later, I inquired about the pies.  \"Hey Darren, man, thanks for the pizza. That shit was good.\"  \"You're welcome. Is there any left?\"  \"Uhhhh. I dunno. Lemme get back to you, ok?\"  And with that, my co-worker split like James Brown at the Apollo.  I jogged to the dumpster outside the dock.  3 empty pizza boxes were laying inside.  30 cuts of pizza were obliterated within 30 minutes. In the hot summer sun, I got...chills for my co-workers are indeed...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjRXfHWtvW4"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, unless you want fresh toppings. Fazio's prides themselves and advertises the best and freshest ingredients, but they use CANNED mushrooms as a pizza topping (disgusting, slimy, and NOT worth what they charge). Be sure to avoid this very popular pizza topping when ordering from Fazio's unless you want a slimy, chemical flavored pizza. NOPE."}
{"text":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Fazio's is the best! We drive over 45 minutes at least once a week to eat here! Strombolis bigger than your head and we are always treated like family! The owner is there all day every day and goes in early to make the sauce and crust from SCRATCH. He is the only one who makes it, so it is consistent. He doesn't skimp on the quality of his ingredients, either. We will forever recommend Fazio's to anyone in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is AMAZING. I ordered only one slice and they made it completely fresh. Can't wait to devour an entire pie next time!"}
{"text":"I like the thin crust pizza these guys serve up. Flavor of the sauce is good. Never any problems with orders here. Food is always cooked properly and ready on time.  Pizza lovers check this place out if you haven't before. They've been around forever and it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"We had Fazio's deliver dinner last week & I can say, that it is as good as any pizza I've eaten from the South Hills.  (If you know who I mean).  I ordered a large white pizza w/ mushrooms & extra cheese and a Italian hoagie.  Both were fresh & delish!  The extra cheese was not necessary.  There was enough leftover for dinner the following Monday.        The delivery person was very friendly & helpful.  This is my new go to pizza place and I live in an area that have plenty choices."}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Lawrenceville and tried this shop, it is our default choice for pizza (even though other shops are closer)! Nothing in the area beats Fazios!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to put Fazio's into words. It can only be sung. All I have to say about Fazio's has already been sung. Stop reading this immediately and go listen to the eternal words of Smokey Robinson and his wonderful composition, \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" if you want to know more about why you should eat every meal at Fazio's forever. Except Mondays because they are closed."}
{"text":"Once again talk is cheap.  Ordered a pizza at 8:30 was told 40min to deliver didn't get till 9:55. Oh I live 3 min walking distance. My fault for being lazy I guess.  On top of that pizza was burn on edge and like warm so dough has that soft not done taste. Total let down. Hate to say it but Dominos woulda been better. Haha that not true dominos sucks too.  Cereal for dinner... Perfect."}
