{"text":"I've been here one time could not get the bartender to even acknowledge I was here I had the fish and chips and was not at all impressed I have not been back and I won't"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick sandwiche. Kept looking for tables....still looking, they don't have them ;) only bar seating and they all have gaming at them, they do have those wooden plate supports for you though. If you live in Vegas, you know what I'm talking about.  I guess the amount of machines allow for smoking as well as food, so expect the person next to you light up as you're eating. Just warning you. The food was good, the prices are good. Robin, was better than good. Other than the sports bar person, she held the whole place down in her own: server, waiter, cocktail waitress, bartender, whatever. She was not only on it all, she was very nice, all smiles, chatty-just enough, and actually anticipated your needs. The place gets three stars, Robin gets four."}
{"text":"I love the bartenders here!!!! Dan and Darren are awesome as well as Lori and Ginger!! Love the night shift!!!"}
{"text":"My local hole in the wall.  William Hill sports book.  Ellis Island beers on tap with full bar.  Kitchen with good food, usually have specials all day.  Mostly video poker but they do have a handful of slot machines.  Never had a bad  time there.  It's dark and it's smoky and they don't have pool or darts but it's a nice place to drink some beers watch the game and place some bets."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome.   It's a small casino with good people working it.  Robin and Mike are the best.  Good food deals and great customer service"}
{"text":"The chef does not know how to cook anything. My chicken tasted burnt. My bacon was hard as a rock and my eggs were slimy. The two stars were for the bartender, she makes a great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"The are always great here. I don't drink. But, I do sit at the bar to eat their fried chicken. Oddly enough, I think they do have the best chicken. Just make sure you  call ahead to see if the haven't run out. It has happened to me 2xs."}
{"text":"1st things 1st: I've come here during \"after hours\" times only (3am-4ish) and Darren is ALWAYS the most hospitable bartender. I've never seen him with less than a huge, welcoming smile at crackhead hours, Ready to put up with my after hours shenanigans. Not only is the food amazing, the service is phenomenal. I will definitely be back, like I am every 2 weeks!"}
{"text":"Super quaint, local spot and definitely a hidden gem! Located behind a gas station on the corner of Sunset and Valle Verde. I honestly thought it was going to be a nasty dinky bar inside but it wasn't. Yes, there is a bit of smoke sometimes when it is super crowded but not as bad as any other bar or small casino.  Their food is amazing though. The buffalo wings are a MUST! They are super meaty and flavorful. The fries are steak fries and delicious. I love that they give you a big side of ranch or blue cheese with your order. The portions are big and the prices are really affordable.  Staff is always nice and friendly and quick to have your drinks ordered. The beer is always nice and cold. Make sure you try their beer which is owned by Ellis Island Brewery, it is very crisp and refreshing."}
{"text":"This is another stop on my trek through all of the hole-in-the-wall bars in Henderson. First off it's owned by Ellis Island Brewery so good beer is on tap. I love their light beer after a meal.  The interior is pretty funky. Lots of long bars with video poker, a decent size sports book and a small corner of slot machines. We parked there and started playing some video keno. A server was there within a minute to offer drinks and kept our glasses full the whole stay. The people there are very friendly. We didn't try food so I can't comment on that.  I can say they get extra points since I won a big jackpot while playing. If I lived closer I would stop here regularly."}
{"text":"I recommend stopping in during happy hour, between 3 and 6 pm.  I got an order of chicken fingers and fries that was so huge I couldn't finish it.  for 4.50!  I agree with the other comments about the bartenders.  I've only experienced the service of the ladies, but they are both awesome!  I am recommending this place to my friends.  The atmosphere isn't bright and cheery, but hey, it's a gaming facility, and we're talking about the food here."}
