{"text":"I agree with the other review that there was absolutely no service at all.  We had to be on top of them to get what we wanted.  Paid $30 for 3 pieces of beef for bbq, and it was not even that tender.  Kind of disappointing.  Bulgogi was ok, but I had better.

But if you want to have a set menu cheap eat for over $20, it is not a bad place.  But bbq was so so."}
{"text":"For the price I found it wasn't justified. I feel like you're paying $30 for a few strips of meat cut into pieces so it fits in your lettuce wrap. Also the lettuce wasn't fresh, some were wilting.. And the server forgot to come and flip our meat so we had to do it ourselves a couple times. I would probably recommend other places instead of this in the area"}
{"text":"I think the main reason people gave low scores was because of the price. But I have to say that their beef bbq is really amazing! Their soups are great too. If you are worried about the price, just grab more friends to share together! One meal is like 30-40bucks which for korean bbq is not bad."}
{"text":"Folks! If you are a fan of Korean cuisine and specifically Korean Barbeque, you need to check Charcoal and Salt in North York!

The Good:

- High quality meats

- a plethora of side dishes, especially the pa-chae is to die for... (spicy green onion salad)

- comes with a soup choice of kimch jjigae or soon tofu jjigae

- good selection of Korean alcoholic beverages: soju, makkgali and korean beers


The Meh~:

- certain cut of meat is never there, jumuluc - thinly sliced pork belly

- they never seem to have sesame leaves, which is a staple in Korean Barbeque

- the server could be more attentive


Overall, a total immersive Korean Barbeque experience.  It's definitely one of the best I've had in Toronto

Price is average for a one person portion of the meat selection: $15~23

I give it three thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"The food is a 3/5. The cuts are low quality. 

Be warned that they intentionally deceive customers by showing double portion sizes on the menu, and only delivering half. Proof is attached in the images. The owner, who spoke English, was extremely rude when I pointed this out, and proceeded to note that it's my problem because apparently they've been in business for five years, and haven't had a complaint about that. Basically, he was gloating that he's been able to purposely cheat his customers for years with no consequences. 

Just don't eat here."}

Charcoal and Salt is one of the numerous Korean restaurants in the Yonge and Finch area. There are definitely much better choices around after my experience here.

Bring a Korean speaking friend or if you speak the language or you are Korean might be the experience can be totally different.

There were zero service from the moment we stepped in, took forever to even get the menu, to order and when the food arrived we got served the wrong food from another table, tea cups also empty..

I want services!! Where is that BELL!!

If one argues maybe if the food is excellent, then it is worth going through all these nonsense. But the food is just similar to what the other Korean restaurants in the area.

Spicy Chicken on a Hot Plate ($9.99) and Beef Short Rib Soup ($9.99) are quite decent and well prepared. But definitely not the best I had.

I doubt I would be back to Charcoal and Salt again soon.. unless someone dragging me in and paying for my meals!"}
