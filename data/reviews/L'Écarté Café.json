{"text":"Such a cute, original place. 

Food is great, ambiance unique. 

The deserts are excellent."}
{"text":"Petit oasis de paix, de verdure et d'objets hétéroclites... Le grilled-cheese aux pommes vertes est délicieux et le propriétaire et le personnel sont cordiaux et chaleureux! Un petit café qui vaut le détour !!"}
{"text":"The most unique and eclectic coffee shop I have have ever visited; a cafe created out of passion and love for strand coffee"}
{"text":"Serge the owner is a true artist, very welcoming, great coffee and food but to me this place is all about the atmosphere and his art."}
{"text":"Merveilleux petit cafe. Le propriétaire est un sculpteur, et ses uvres sont disposes un peu partout dans le cafe. La bouffe est bonne, le cafe aussi. 

On y va surtout pour le service amicale et chaleureux, la superbe terrasse extérieur, et la tranquillité de l'endroit. 

Le meilleur cafe du quartier sans question."}
{"text":"The perfect idyllic hideaway on a sunny day... My bf and I almost walked right by this place but spotted a sign reading \"café ouvert\" and were intrigued by its quaintness.

We were immediately warmly greeted (in French) by a very sweet lady who encouraged us to sit on the terrace. She was more than happy to accommodate us in English and listed off an amazing list of their offerings for the day. We went with a fresh gazpacho (served with fresh garnishes & a ripe slice of watermelon), and can I just say... it was the best gazpacho I've ever tasted. We also each got an americano and enjoyed it.

The terrace area felt like something out of a dream, like a Wonderland or Secret Garden, and we kept finding curious trinkets hiding in the foliage. It's a real work of art.

When we cashed out, the lady who helped us made polite conversation about where we were visiting from and gave us helpful recommendations for things to see downtown.

I hope to some day return to this cafe. In the meantime, I will tell all of my Montreal-bound friends about it!"}
