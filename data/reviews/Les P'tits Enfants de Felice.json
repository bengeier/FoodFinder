The two quarterbacks / baristas ( am/pm) greet you with a warm smile and deliver quick and professional service .. Bravo"}
{"text":"Just opened yesterday! This replaces the Iconic navarino. Although I miss it dearly this place is also really nice! Very bright and and they kept many of the things that made Navarino so fun. They've repainted the walls in white and added lots of marble. It looks fresh and new. A bit more modern and sleek.   It's no longer cash only. The machines should be coming soon (2 weeks they said). Right now they are giving free coffee so we can get a taste.  I got a hot chocolate and my boyfriend got a latte. The hot chocolate was good and my boyfriend really enjoyed his latte. Not too hot but not served cold either. Speedy and friendly service. They're a bit packed at the moment because it is so new.   It's well executed, they're going to do well here even though they have a lot to live up to."}
