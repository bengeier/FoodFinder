{"text":"This is my very favorite Mexican food.  I've never been disappointed.  La Favorita is my favorite along with the cheese dip and sangria.  Even the chicken soup is amazing.  The service is excellent!  There's nowhere better in Pittsburgh for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The chimichangas are the best thing on the menu. I also highly suggest getting a pitcher of Margarita's, they are amazing!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On a hot summer day, three high school friends ventured to try Gran Agave at the waterfront, and boy were they happy!   We needed a place to catch up, have some great food and enjoy the atmosphere we were in, we decided to go to Gran Agave and see what the hype was all about!   I must say living in Pittsburgh for all of my 26 years, I don't think I had Mexican food that I felt was just so goood! It was authentic, delicious and scrumptious!   The moment we walked in we were greeted with a kind and courteous staff, we immediately were attended to with drinks and Delicious HOT and crispy chips and salsa. The salsa is not like your regular chi-chi's salsa you get at the grocery store either, it is savory and has a little bit of a kick to it!   We ordered the cheese dip to go along with our chips and the cheese just melted in your mouth. It didn't taste processed or had many preservatives.   We also decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla and boy I am glad we did because the portion size is huge and we were definitely full after doing that!   What a great place at the Waterfront!   :)"}
{"text":"I am loving the veg items! I wouldn't suggest the taco salad because you'll get a ton of the \"flavor veggies\" like onion in it and not much else interesting. This time around, I ordered the veg chalupa and cheese enchilada. Very tasty, nice portion sizes, and a great price. (Under $10 for late lunch!) I also love that black beans can be substituted for refried. My partner was able to get the sopas vegetarian and were tasty as well. It's not often that I have found carrots in med food and I like it.   Our service was very slow this time. Perhaps because we were outside, I'm not sure if that factored in. Maybe due to the holiday staffing, but it was not packed at all. We had to ask for water after empty water glass being ignore on several server rounds."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time. The service was great, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. We received menus along with chips and salsa. The salsa tasted fresh and the chips were nice and warm. We got some guacamole dip as well. I'm not sure if it is homemade there, my guess is that it isn't. Nonetheless, it was tasty!  I ordered a chicken quesadilla and my husband ordered the gran burrito.  We also shared a lime margarita, which was okay. It was not the best I've ever had, tasted like the cheap mixer you can buy at the store. My husband enjoyed his burrito which came with steak and chicken. I, however, did not enjoy the quesadilla. The chicken had a seasoning that I didn't enjoy, it tasted like chicken you would eat with gravy and mashed potatoes, not a quesadilla.  In general, it just didn't have much flavor. I could only muster eating a quarter of it.  We ended up getting fried ice cream which was pretty good, can't go wrong with ice cream.  Overall, I thought it was a decent place, I wouldn't mind going back and trying something else."}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR BILL-they change the prices on you.  I had 2 of the same drinks and the price was different. Also, the lunch combo meal price printed on the menu was VERY different than what I was charged!!! 5 star on the food!! Excellent, fresh meals. WATCH THE PRICES ON YOUR BILL!!! Gotta give it 2 stars because of the shadiness of the bill. It's super shady."}
{"text":"Visited on 8-20-16 for late lunch. Worse service ever (Fernando). Waited over 45 minutes for our food (party of 3) and when the server finally came to the table we asked where the food was he was rude, rolling his eyes and overall disrespectful. We asked for the check for the drinks and to speak to a manager and there wasn't a manager in the restaurant. Clearly the ownership is making enough money and doesn't want additional patrons. Went across the street to RockBottom and was rewarded with excellent food and outstanding service...Rock on!"}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Mexican food.  Everything is made fresh including complementary the chips and salsa.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We come here often.   The servers are always friendly. The service is quick.   This is unique Mexican.  Nothing like Mad Mex (nothing wrong with them! Its just different and not unique).    My favorite dish is pollo fundido. It comes as a lunch or dinner. The dinner is a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little Mexican place at the Waterfront.   The chips and salsa were sub-par, fajitas were good, and the drinks were all made very strong!  Overall a good restaurant I would return to, but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Time and time again this place delivers. The food is always consistent as is the service. By far the best place to eat in the area. Do yourself a favor and get the Choriqueso..."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the good.  My server was very nice and accommodating of my group's requests.  Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  The decor is fun, festive, and funky.  Kinda makes you forget you're at the Waterfront.  Things really just started to go downhill when the food came out.  The fried chips and thin salsa roja didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I'm not usually one to pass up on a big ol' bowl of chips and salsa, but this starter was just not appealing.  I ordered option C from the \"Gran Agave Vegetarian Plates\" section of the menu: one quesadilla with bean burrito and a chalupa.  I was expecting the quesadilla to be the star of the show, so I was pretty disappointed when I received a flat, tasteless quesadilla filled with nothing but cheese.  Is it too much to ask for some veggies in a vegetarian quesadilla??  The accompanying bean burrito was smothered in sauce, completely drowning the taco shell of the chalupa.  All in all, kind of a mess, and definitely not what I was expecting.  My boyfriend ordered the beef flautas, which were extremely dry and tasteless.  My parents, on the other hand, both enjoyed their meals.  But it may have had something to do with the shot of Patron and Dos Equis. Who knows.    I probably would not return to this restaurant, although I do appreciate the variety of Mexican food they offer, especially for vegetarians.  Portion sizes are extremely generous.  I'd recommend staying away from the \"Americanized\" offerings and maybe trying something more authentic."}
{"text":"Poor management has caused me to add gran agave to my banned list. I had been a weekly customer since they opened and will never return after the GM accused me of using an invalid coupon. Not my fault that DoubleTakeDeals has a buggy website.  Instead of politely making me aware of an issue he makes a scene in front of his customers. All over a two dollar coupon.  I have eaten there hundreds of times.  Good food but I and my co-workers will never return.  Shameful treatment of a formerly loyal long-time customer.  Very insulting.  Please quit offering online coupons if you do not know how they work."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and can confidently say this is the best in the 'Burgh! Their chimichangas are out of this world amazing and even their salsa has a nice kick to it. What really makes them stand out is the quality of their margaritas. I've never had better! If going with a group of 3 or more it's not a bad idea to just split a pitcher!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars is more like it -- but  I can't give it 3, I want to cause the servers are all super nice, but the food. Man the food isn't very special -- and some of it was bad.   I've been here a few times, that said, the only thing I have gotten that was wonderful were the chips and salsa that they give you for free. 5/5  I'm not one to like salty food to begin with, so I usually have the opposite complaint - but I don't think they use any salt or pepper when preparing food. Yes, there is salt on the table, however when fillings are completely unseasoned, sprinkling the top isn't really going to help. In addition, you can't stir the sauce covering enchiladas or burritos, so adding table salt is fruitless. I digress.   Yolandas - Chicken was stringy, tasted like uncrisp chicken skin (but was meat) and chewy. Red sauce was flavorless. I wouldn't order it again and I'd advise others to avoid. 1/5  Cheese Enchiladas - Corn tortilla that didn't have the typical taste or texture of a corn tortilla. No subtle sweet hint of corn, no  grit -- a whole like like a flour tortilla. Cheese was flavorless. I thought maybe the sauce was drowning out the cheese, but it was also on my beans and I couldn't taste it there either.  Sauce, first of all way too much on the plate probably 2 cups -- and it tasted faintly of metal can, chili powder, and a hint of cayenne. With sauce scraped off 2/5.  Beef enchilada - same underwhelming tortilla and sauce as the cheese enchilada with under seasoned beef.  The beef did melt in your mouth - super moist. 2/5  Beef taco - stale shell, same under seasoned beef. 0/5 -- because the shell was that horrible.  Rice - just like Uncle Ben used to make. Flavorless and no veggies, but cooked well. 2/5  Beans - with added salt, they were standard issue. 3/5  Guacamole - super flavorful in a sea of bland. 4/5  There is a note on the menu about not all Mexican food being spicy - I appreciate that because a lot of people complain if it is not spicy it's not \"authentic\". I really want to make real clear that isn't what I am talking about. A lot of the food lack any actual flavor - cheese enchiladas tasted just like the beef with a slight textural difference. The rice tasted like it white rice right out of the box. Beans needed salt added to be \"ok\" tasting. Etc. Etc.   Service is usually good, sometimes slow though. Last time, the food came out pretty slow. There were 2 tables of 2-4 people already eating when we arrived, and it took 30 minutes to get food. And one group came in while we were there, so they didn't get swamped.  The decor is nice. No dollar store sombreros and real wood stools and benches."}
{"text":"I have gone here several times and it is always fabulous! The enchiladas are awesome, I like the chicken best but any are good. Also, love the fresh sliced tomatoes, freshly shredded cheese, and homemade guac that many dishes here come with. Unlike some places that just put pre-chopped/packaged veggies and toppings on the food, you can actually taste the freshness of the toppings here. I usually get a combo of chicken enchilada, beef taco, and chalupa and it's perfect sized (maybe even too much with the comp chips and salsa you get).  Remember, it's authentic so your not getting a chalupa like at a Taco Bell people, and it's incredible. They only serve Mexican beer, but do have several options, and it's very tasty with the chips and salsa while waiting for your food. You may have to wait a min for a table due to the limited space they have but it's well worth it. Love this place, hope it stays great! Best Mexican around!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the kids and family and eat authentic Mexican food! The service was great as well as the food, I really do miss Chi Chi's but this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate outside. The area was beautiful. Our service was not great. Our glasses were empty for a couple minutes, hardly got checked on.   The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the queso and chorizo dip. It was rich, tasty and full of sausage. We shared the gran burrito. It was massive and filled with delicious steak and chicken with fresh avacados on top."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Hot chips with salsa served right when you sit down. The people that work there are always so friendly and nice. The food is decently priced and it tastes delicious! It is a small lil' place, but cozy much the same.   I always get nervous when I go to Mexican restaurants because I always ask for my dish, minus the peppers. I have never once received a weird look for it, they just say \"no problem!\" The fried beans are very good, the quesadillas are very good, as well as their fajitas. The proportions are huge- I always have leftovers!  Defiantly go here for great Mexican food and a friendly environment."}
{"text":"What's authentic?  I had two white people from Wisconsin tell me that Gran Agave was the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the 'Burgh.  Hmm....of course, he just texted me that he majored in Spanish in college.  Okay, then!  I had the chicken w/mole sauce, and the usual fare of burritos, tacos, and empanadas.  The portion sizes are huge.  The food is flavorful, especially the mole sauce.  The service was fine, but I was there for lunch, and there weren't many patrons.  Amazingly, I didn't have a margarita.  I can't remember why not, maybe because I was already drunk.  Or not.  Clearly, my vague description of the food categorizes me as a poor reviewer of what is authentic.  I did eat at a Yucatan restaurant once, beside a cenote.  THAT was good.  I definitely think it's worth trying, and if we're in the Waterfront area for shopping, we'll probably come here for our lunch/dinner.  What are your other choices: Dave & Buster's?  PF Chiangs?  (Ok, I actually like PF Chiang's a lot.)  Or you could walk across the bridge to Red Robin.  Eh.  I like it here, and I'll come back to get my fix."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant. We had bad service; it was very slow, and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. The food tasted like they took it out of the freezer and microwaved it. Mine was half cold; I couldn't even eat. Definitely wont be going here again."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place. It is family owned & operated. It's so authentic and I've never had a bad experience. The food is Amazing. Try the cheese dip!! The salsa is home made and very tasty and addicting. The margaritas are killer!!!!! Everything is also very reasonably priced. The service is always very good.  I  Eat here usually once a week. It's always clean  and I love the decor ! It makes me feel like im in mexico as soon as I step in the door. I'd recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, I've had better. Service was kinda slow"}
{"text":"The best mexican food in Pittsburgh.  My favorites are their enchiladas, the chicken fajitas, and of course the Margaritas.  The even have a diabetic friendly margarita the has less sugar in it!  The service has always been good for me and I highly recommend checking Gran Agave out because it is truly a cut above any other mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good. I didn't expect that, this far north.   The service and ambience are Ho-hum. Thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  The servers are GREAT!!!  I like to ask for the cheese/sauces on the side so I can make sure the dish is just how I like it.  They are super accommodating and I reccommend this place to everyone - I even gave them shining reviews on my blog: http://soleforthesoul.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/no-words-needed/"}
{"text":"This was bland Mexican food.  We enjoyed the chips and salsa, but should have probably left then.  I had the steak fajitas and although the portion size was huge (how does anyone fit all that into 3 little tortillas?), it was missing seasoning to indicate to my mouth that I was eating fajitas and not just strips of steak, peppers and onions.  I think with a decent drizzle of cheese and a bun, it could have been an ok philly cheesesteak sandwich.  My husband ordered a burrito and a chile relleno.  The burrito was ok, a bit boring, but edible.  The chile relleno was missing a key part, the pepper.  The menu stated that their chile relleno version is a piece of bell pepper covered with meat and cheese.  In reality what he got was just a blob of overly salty cheese.  My husband who eats just about anything couldn't stand it.  The rice and bean accompaniments were also pretty blah.  Maybe they had an off night, but I don't think we will chance it again."}
{"text":"Fast service and very polite staff.  Food was a bit spicey for my taste but was good none-the-less. Great restaurant if you are looking for more traditional Mexican fare."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in the city. The food quality and service are consistently great. Many of the dishes are large enough to share. The more traditional dishes are the ones we typically order. Though the quesadillas are my favorite. They also have amazing coffee."}
{"text":"Great food, no wait even on busy weekends. My favorite mexican place in Pittsburgh.  I have been here twice and it's been great both times.  Salsa is perfect,  homemade chips are great."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place, It doesn't \"blow\" me away or anything like that, but I do think it is pretty good. I've just come to the realization that it is difficult to find anything that ressembles the mexican food that I ate most of my youth and while travlling abroad. So this satisifies my desire and they have been pretty consistent,I just wish that they had a smaller portion sizes for maybe a cheaper amount because their portion sizes are pretty large."}
{"text":"Headed here after a long day in Pittsburgh. Enjoyed our margaritas, and our server was extremely friendly. I ordered a quesadilla which was stuffed nicely, but not cut. My boyfriend also had to as for a side of beans, since his mean didn't come with it, which is uncommon in our experience. The atmosphere was great, and we will be returning if we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Travel a lot. I rank this Mexican restaurant near the bottom. Had the enchiladas. Covered with way to much crap. The mole sauce tasted like chocolate syrup. My wife had the seafood quesadilla it was bland made with imitation seafood. The only good thing was the waiter."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant!  From the salsa and cheese dip to the burritos and tostaguac, everything is delicious!  It's family owned and so friendly. Try the sangria too...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The best combination of good Mexican food and reasonable prices that I've experienced in Pittsburgh so far.  At 3:30/4:00ish, there was a handful of people in the restaurant.  Staff were friendly and efficient.  I ordered the chiles poblanos ($9.50).  My dining companions ordered El Combo ($12.50) and the Burritos Deluxe ($9.95).  The chiles poblanos came out steaming hot (actually too hot to eat), along with rice and beans.  Instead of red enchilada sauce on top, they had sour cream, which was interesting.  The cheese wasn't quite as melty as I like it, but they were still some of the best chiles rellenos I've had in Pittsburgh.  (Cuzamil's are good, but they're also $14.50 for 2.)  El Combo was so big that half of it got boxed.  There was a taco, a chile relleno, a tostada, two enchiladas, and rice and beans.  The burritos deluxe were fork-and-knife affairs, since they came out covered in enchilada sauce, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.  They sort of nickel-and-dime you for some things -only the first basket of chips & salsa is free, you only get 3 refills on sodas (but their glasses are huge), that type of thing.  However, there have been $5 off $25 and $10 off $50 coupons in the last two Clipper magazines, and when I was Googling the address I came across a printable coupon.  Supposedly they have happy hour from 4-6.  They have a full bar, a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers, and two big TVs.  Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good for Pittsburgh, and - more importantly - it's affordable.  I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"As an avid lover of Mexican cuisine, I would not classify this restaurant as serving Mexican cuisine, but rather a cheap, watered-down version of American Mexican. The food at Gran Agave was bland, tasted like ingredients from a can, and removed the essence of what makes Mexican cuisine one of the most vibrant and enjoyable.   I had a lunch special with a taco and enchilada. The enchilada was soggy and the prevalent flavor was grease, despite the generous amount of sauce included in the plate. The taco was \"American style\" with lettuce and cheese and again very greasy ground beef in a hard shell. There was nothing authentic about the food, and it was an extremely underwhelming experience overall. The lasting impact of the food was found in the terrible heartburn I experienced. I have never eaten at a restaurant before that deserved zero stars, but this one surely did."}
{"text":"First time here, and it'll be the last.  Pros:  -got seated right away  -margarita was decent  -chips and salsa was the best tasting part of the meal  Cons: -1st basket of chips free, pay for additional...which I have no problem with but they came to the table and took  the basket away and didn't even offer for me to buy more.   -service was slow and difficult to understand   -ordered chicken enchiladas Yolanda's.  They brought out regular chicken enchiladas but since we waited over 30 minutes I just ate it :-/  -unlike other local Mexican places we go, the chicken was mostly dark meat vs white   -never offered to refill beverages...even though our empty cups sat on the edge of the table. Finally we were able to flag someone down to get more  Overall this was a pretty bad experience and I will never go back. I would also not recommend. To anyone. I almost wanted to say something to the people waiting in line when we were leaving, but that's not my place."}
{"text":"Average/good Mexican food at a great price. They also give you a very large portion. Service is friendly. Chips and salsa are very good!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, the beef in the fajitas was pretty bland but the veggies were pretty good. Rice was also bland."}
{"text":"First and last time here. I ordered a taco salad. Described as beans, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole and sour cream in an edible shell. Yes, the ingredients were all there. However, the beans were as smooth as baby food and the beef was almost pureed. They both smelled and tasted like canned dog food. Bad, cheap dog food. I've never eaten dog food but hv a distinct feeling I last night I was eating it for the 1st time! To get to the dog food, you had to shovel under 3 cups of lettuce, 1 chunk of a hard un-ripe tomato, a few shreds of white plastic - tasting cheese and guac with the consistency of jarred baby food peas. The edible salad bowl was burnt. And the entire mess was all waterlogged in about 1/2\" of water at the base of the soggy, \"edible\" salad bowl.  The waiter could not understand much of what we were saying and had no idea what each ordered. He'd just place the food on the middle of the table and leave.  The sopapilles were 3 wedges of hard flat flour tortillas the size of 3 dorito chips served with a tablespoon of ice cream.  A bad finale to a bad meal."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty often as it's close to my husbands work. The staff there are all very friendly, lots of smiles. Friendly but not too chatty which is what I like. We get a lot for your money, and I think it's tasty.   There are several different things to chose from if your vegetarian, which is important for us. The reason I decided to review today was because after two+ years going there for dinner, we received meat in a vegetarian dish for the second time yesterday. The first time, was about six months ago. I ordered a burrito with beans only. I didn't inspect it before sticking a bite in my mouth (I was talking, not look at food) and I ended up with a huge mouthful of ground beef. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years so I was pretty disgusted and spit it out onto to my plate. They did take that dish of our bill, and offered to replace but I had completely lost my appetite. I have ordered that dish a ton since that, with no issues, although I always check it before I bite in. So last night, we ordered a vegetarian combo. It comes with a mushroom quesadilla. As I was chomping into the leftovers today, I bit into a huge chunk of chicken! Just one stray piece of chicken. Gross! Spit it out...  So I feel really torn about that place because when the food is right its good and the wait staff are so friendly. Two times biting into meat in the same restaurant is pretty off putting though... I haven't had this happen at any other restaurants in Pittsburgh and have lived here 5 years and eat out a lot."}
{"text":"BEST NACHOS EVER! We make a meal out of them in addition to the endless (free) chips and salsa. Everything else is pretty standard Americanized Mexican... same basic ingredients just wrapped, layered, and cooked different ways. Try the margaritas though, fresh fruit, perfectly balanced. Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh despite the un-authenticity."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant!! So, so good. The servers are really friendly and the faijtas are the best! The margaritas aren't too sweet and in the summer, they have outside seating. Its really affordable and casual. I just love this place."}
{"text":"Welcome to the land of plenty! If you're looking for large plates stacked high with food, Gran Agave is the place to go.  I visited with a large group of friends and was pleased overall with my experience, even if it wasn't perfect. On walking in our group realized the seats here aren't easily re-arranged to allow groups to sit together, which was doubly complicated because they had a filming crew in taking footage for a commercial. So four of us ended up sitting in a booth while the rest of the group sat at some high tables. I just wish we could've all been together.  The menus were enormous, so if you like choice, you'll like it here! And yeah, like I said earlier, man the dishes here are huge. My table ordered the nacho appetizer and honestly it was probably all we needed food-wise, especially on top of the complimentary chips and salsa that everyone is given at the start of the meal. The nachos were just one large round plate PILED high with chips, meat, guacamole and tomato and lettuce. I also ordered their smallest margarita - their smallest is 32 oz. (So hey, next time you have a bad day at work, you know where to go!)  Where the food began disappointing me was my main course. A lot of other people really liked what they got so I know everything we had as a group overall was mostly good. I think for me it was mostly a texture issue - I had ordered a combo that came with two enchiladas, rice and beans. The \"beans\" were surprisingly more of a paste, which combined with the filling in my cheesy enchiladas basically made most of my meal...mushy. I know it sounds a little odd to bring up, but hey, sometimes texture can make or break a meal, and sometimes I honestly can't handle mushy food. I also kind of wish the enchiladas had more of a kick to them; the food here IS advertised as being a bit plain compared to what we're used to, though (even says so right on the menu), so that wasn't surprising. To be fair, my main meal really wasn't too bad - it was just a bit of a disappointment after the amazingly delicious nachos.  Last word of advice: beware going into the bathrooms late on a Saturday. I don't think anyone cleaned them since that morning and they smelled really, really bad. Ugh.  I think a fair final say from me is that the food can definitely be a bit hit-or-miss here, but the atmosphere and staff are great, and even the 'meh' food I had was fine and dandy. I'd definitely come back again if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"The queso Blanco is the best. I've ordered a few things off the menu and I'm usually not disappointed. A great place for margaritas and appetizers"}
{"text":"This is a place for hot food nuts.  It is the only place I have been that when I requested their hottest hot sauce they gave me a habanero purée.  Everything I have had has been spicy with a clean strong flavor.  My only complaint is that the staff can be a bit slow and a bit under staffed.  Despite that this is still my favorite Mexican place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for tacos n margs. Food that I recommend is everything but my favorites are the carnitas verdes, chimichanga (fried, of course), guac, any of the tacos are delicious! So is the peach margarita!  And step out of your comfort zone and try something new, something different. The flavor is there trust me. Don't order a quesadilla and call it a day, yadadamean (urban dictionary it!)?  Sit at the bar for quick seating and fast service! ;)"}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Mexican food! Eat lunch here frequently. The home-made chips and salsa are reason enough to come here. Even my picky wife liked it!"}
{"text":"Do Not Go Here! I walked past here this morning 9:33am and their was Dirty Plates, cups, and other  items left on multiple tables near the window the ones near East Bridge Street Road"}
{"text":"We come here all the time and I love it. The staff is friendly and generally the service is quick. The chips and salsa are great. This is a great place to come for lunch. The portions are generous, but the prices are great. My favorite entree for dinner is the poblanos stuffers. I have never had anything that I didn't like. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places to eat if you like good quality Mexican food! The overall quality of the food here is amazing! The ingredients that they use (Beef, Chicken, Produce) are all very fresh and of above average quality. Their Chorizo is very, very good! Top notch!  As for Tequila, there is a vast selection to choose from They have a true passion for Tequila and are willing to share that with you if you have the interest. It is a really great place to learn more about this special spirit.  The staff has always been very friendly and helpful! And the price is amazingly affordable!  I have been to many types of Mexican restaurants across the country. From \"fast food\" type to full blown to \"Empty your wallet\" style.  The Gran Agave is as good as any I have ever tried! Don't take my word for it, give it a try yourself. *hint* ask for a taste of \"901\""}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh! Great fresh ingredients, the vegetables and meat were all cooked to perfection. Staff is miserably slow."}
{"text":"Great value for the portion sizes. Easily have half of a lunch entree left over for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to Pittsburg back in April so this is an old review that never was published.   Food was mediocre,  there was no flavor in the food. I ordered a taco salad, and it was so oily and the meat was extremely sauce. My sister order the enchiladas and she didn't enjoy it because it too was tasteless. The only thing we enjoyed were the tortilla chips and salsa that was complimentary with our meal. I was disappointed that we didn't go to Panera Bread instead and would have had a healthier meal."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes in Pittsburgh, there aren't a lot of options if you are looking for something traditional. This place definitely hit on some good things, but there were some disappointments as well. I like that it's a small place with a homey feel to it. The salsa was delicious and very fresh; however, the chips left a little to be desired. They were on the stale side, and the oil used for the chips was at least a day old. Maybe on a different day the chips would have been fresh, but I'm just judging on one experience.  I coudn't decide what to order as there were many options on the menu, so I just ordered an order of chicken quesadillas and a side of rice. My friend ordered a combo with an echilada, taco, and relleno. My chicken quesadillas were really yummy, and the rice was decent. Nothing special, but good. My friend's dish looked tasty as well, and everything seemed well cooked. Perhaps it was just because I was comparing this place to my favorite authentic Mexican joint of all time, but I thought it was just okay. But, that being said, for Pittsburgh, it's a solid choice.  I definitely want to go back to give the chips another try."}
{"text":"Honestly, pretty run of the mill Mexican Restaurant.  The veggie fajitas were warm, fresh, tasty, but nothing to really write home about.  Portion sizes were beyond adequate.  Seemed like a nice, casual, fun environment.  The chips were nice and warm, which was a plus.  The salsa was the standard watery roja concoction that is typical of many Mexican restaurants.  Not my personal favorite, but still enjoyable.  Service was good.    Honestly, I would have liked my food to have had a bit more of a \"kick.\"  Perhaps more garclic, perhaps more spice in general."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Saturday night. Our waitress was slow and when she brought the pina colada it was overfilling and spilled on the table. She made a remark \" drink it fast\". She was rude and we had to ask her to bring napkins. She never cleaned it up. Our service was slow and she seemed like she didn't care being there. The food was good but definitely not worth going back again.  I would recommend going to another restaurant at the waterfront."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Pittsburgh from New Jersey.  I am familiar with both traditional Mexican and Tex-mex food.  Everyone that worked there was very nice, and it was good to see some tap beers, but the food was sub-par.  It was extremely bland. The chicken tamale and guacamole were very very under seasoned.  My chicken enchilada had a bone in it (about an inch long)."}
{"text":"I was excited to discover this place as it looks promising... The chips and salsa were excellent, but the food was unfortunately only so-so. I tried the chicken enchiladas and fajitas, and while both were decent neither was worth repeating. I will probably try this place again in the future but order something different and perhaps try the margaritas."}
{"text":"I'd like to kick everyone who's reviews convinced me to eat here. Food was bland and unappetizing. Salsa was tangy. Like it was a bit off. The food all congealed on the plate in one big puddle. We will. Or return."}
{"text":"If you don't like real everyday Mexican food, then this place isn't for you.  Real Mexican food that is not Tex-Mex, it's not your one night out a month at D.F., but it's real, fresh, homemade ingredients, cooked fresh in every dish. Not for your touristy Mexican restaurant patrons, but for your people who want real Mexican food in a Mexican restaurant. Can't beat this food and service is impeccable even in ridiculous amounts of patrons waiting outside.  They are great at what they do.  Forget the bad reviews, those people were looking for the buffet at the last resort they stayed at in Cancun. Good food, great location, good price, great service, you gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and delicious margaritas. I eat here quite often and am always pleased."}
{"text":"First time here, will return!  Gran Agave has been recommended several times but never had the chance to try it until today.  We were not disappointed.  The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa is not overpowering with heat and the chips are the dense type.    The enchiladas, with the four different kinds were very good and very tasty.  Not spicy, but with flavor.  The chicken fajita was huge and sizzling.    The service was very good and the restaurant, although small, was very inviting.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sadly, This great Mexican Restaurant is closing on Sunday, November 13, 2016. I'm not sure of the details, but I think the landlord is looking for a bigger paying tenant. I'll miss it. The Burrito Gran Agave with the Verde sauce IS the best. Thanks for the enjoyable meals."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the Waterfront. Pleasant helpful service. Great for a quick bite or drinks and quality Mexican cuisine with friends."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican place at the Waterfront. I have been to Gran Agave a few times, most recently this past weekend. The food is always satisfactory and I have never had to wait for a table. They seem to have all of the basics down, free chips and salsa, large menu, good margaritas and fresh ingredients. The guacamole is always tasty and the mole sauce is on point. The portions are large and filling. The chicken in the tacos and quesadillas taste like it has been slow roasted for several hours. My only criticism is the wait staff. On Saturday, our waiter was visibly unhappy and impatient. Also, another server spilled a tray full of drinks right behind my dining companion and did not apologize or ask if he got wet. All in all, go to Gran Agave for the food, not for the friendly service."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant 4 different times, 2 for lunch and 2 for dinner. Both times, we were seated quickly and received attentive service. The food is very good and the menu is extensive.  This past visit, I asked if I could have shrimp in my burrito instead of chicken and they obliged without hesitation - I was thrilled. And our bill for dinner was still a little under $29 even with leftovers to take home.  Parking is plentiful around the corner and there's a nice ambiance to walk around."}
{"text":"My fav mexican place so far. Best tacos, great assortment of tequila, great service. Make sure you get a lil cup of queso blanco with those chips ;)"}
{"text":"This place goes against tradition. usually when I go into mexican places and they are nice and well kept....it sucks. This place is awesome tho, the inside is decorated with some great murals, nice tables, cozy bar. The portions are huge and the prices are great. The only thing that I don't absolutely love about this place is the margarita prices. I find them a little steep. Its a great place to go for dinner though and I highly reccomend it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! I am so sad to hear that it is closing! It is a shame that the waterfront pushed out a small business for a popular chain restaurant. Gran agave is a great place with great workers and I am very sad to see it close."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Gran Agave!  By far the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh, and on par/above lots of Mexican food I've had down South.  I've tried nearly everything on their menu, and have loved it all.  In particular, the carnitas,  tacos and quesadillas are delicious.  Their food always tastes fresh, and it's not too greasy or smothered in cheap cheese.  At the bar they have a serious variety of tequilas, as well as beers; and the owner makes his own margarita mix, so no yucky neon green bottles of mix here.  For me, though, I go with a paloma every time.  The one thing I would change is having to pay for the second batch of chips and dip, but I guess I can't always get what I want ;)"}
{"text":"Very poor food quality, utterly tasteless hard chips, the so called salsa looked amd tasted like hunts tomato sauce.  Food was so bland and Inedible we wasted our money. I doubt a lime was squeezed into their margaritas   I'm sure homestead could care less about quality food though"}
{"text":"This is a solid no fuss Mexican option. They're casual, polite, and accommodate just about any requests. Family friendly, yet a full bar with several big tv's. If you want it spicey, ask for hotter salsa. I've lived in Mexico, that's what they do."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment, since the person who recommended it to me is Mexican. I thought the food was a little bland. I lived in SoCal for years and there was such great Mexican food in the area then. I was hoping I'd find that in the area, but so far I haven't found a great Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. The search continues..."}
{"text":"When you get your meals, I would ask for the sauce on the side (just so you can try it before it gets smothered all over your burrito, enchilada, etc).  I get number 11 (taco, burrito, and enchilada) all beef.   I also get it without the sauce (I really do not like the sauces they put on the burrito and taco) and order a side of large cheese sauce and just dump it.  It's so yummy!  Also get their sweet tea and fried ice cream!  Definitely get the cheese sauce (under 'Dips') and use it for your chips and meals.    The service I had was also awesome.  Quick, friendly, efficient, and generous."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner tonight. Initially we were on a wait list at another eatery in waterfront. While waiting we walked around. I've walked by this place plenty of times but must have overlooked it. Once we spotted it, we were set on Mexican and canceled our other reservations.  Complimentary chips and salsa.. Yas. The restaurant is a little small but seems to work well. They have a large bar in the back as well as high tops and booths. Outdoor seating is also offered.  We ordered taquitos as an app. The order came with like 8 of them which was a good deal.  My bf went with the chimchanga and I went with a combination plate (many options)   While the wait for our food took a little, it was very flavorful and delicious once it arrived. Out server didn't really check on us, but dropped off refills as needed.  Overall not a bad spot. We asked about dessert and he mentioned fried ice cream as well as churros. I fully intened on heading back."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and I try different vegetarian options each time. I've never had a bad meal, and service is usually great. Everything always tastes very fresh. The strawberry margaritas are awesome too."}
{"text":"I was a staunch supporter of this place the first few years it was open. Even closed it down a few nights with friends and the staff. Over the past year, it's plummeted down hill. I posted a pic of s bug that was in my drink. The server could care less. Not even an apology. I'd like to say this is an isolated incident, but the previous time I was here, I had the same terrible service (from the same server mind you). There's too many choices in Pittsburgh to waste my time coming back. Wish Gran Agave the best of luck in turning things around."}
{"text":"We have eaten here probably 20 or so times over the past few years and i don't know why i have not reviewed it yet!   This has our go-to place for Mexican food.  Every time we go i get their burritos because they are so damn good!  So much food and it tastes amazing!    We always get the cheese dip for the chips and we devour them!    The prices are awesome,  two huge meals for under 30 bucks?  Awww yeaaa!    We have never had bad service and will be customers as long as they are around!"}
{"text":"The kitchen was soooo slow and the food wasn't worth the wait.  They managed to over fry the entrees to where the flour tortillas came out so over done they ruined the taste of the entree - ALL Zhou tasted was burnt tortilla."}
{"text":"I liked Gran Agave a little more than Darren did but was still disappointed since I'd been wanting to come here for a while. The best thing I had was the black bean soup with rice which was very hearty. Darren's churros with ice cream were also decent. My combo #8 came with an enchilada (blah. they use something to stretch out the ground meat in some way, and it tasted funny), a tamale (not bad), Mexican rice (so-so), and fried beans (one bite was enough). The decor was cute though, and our server was really nice and helpful. I don't think I'd want to return."}
{"text":"Time of Visit:  Dinner around 7 on a Sunday Night @ the Waterfront (and it was nice outside)  Not too crowded, we were seated immediately! In fact, we were originally seated @ a table and a manager asked us if we'd prefer a booth instead (well, of course!).  So he had a table bused and moved up immediately.  Service:  Wasn't bad, but I think our waiter was new.  There were other waiters that seemed to be really on top of it and the manager that moved us was very nice!!  Our waiter wasn't \"bad\" by any means, we didn't want for anything, he just lacked personality.  Atmosphere:        Small restaurant, about 10-15 booths surrounding the perimeter of the restaurant and a handful of tables in the middle. There was a cute bar area too with tall chairs.  They do have a Full Bar; it was clearly stocked with many different types of liquors. As a whole, this place is VERY clean!!   (as were the bathrooms!  Yay!)  Food:          Very generous portions and flavorful! I'd recommend the Fundito Pollo (its basically a Chicken Chimichanga); Oh!  Get the sour cream \"on the side\"; trust me... it was COVERED! LOL My husband got a beef burrito (which he said was probably the best he'd ever had) and a taco which was also good.  Pricing:       Not bad @ all!   For the both of us our bill was just a tad over $25 and, as I mentioned earlier, the portions were very generous!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh. Have not had anything here I have not liked. Thumbs up for the carnitas Verde."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm at the waterfront I crave the huge portions of fajitas that are served in this establishment! One order is plenty for two, just order extra tortillas. As far as authentic Mexican dishes I haven't tried enough of them to know but it seems more like Tex Mex which is still super YUM! So far Pittsburgh has yet to show me the real deal.  Let's talk drinks! Lots of tequila choices or freshly muddled mojitos. The pitchers of Sangria and Margaritas are very reasonable and not made from mixes. They seem to be bottomless too! Whew get some dinner or a designated driver for the ride home. In the summer you can sit outside and enjoy the fountain and people watch. Perfect for Fajita Friday, Sangria Saturday, or a lazy Sunday funday afternoon!"}
{"text":"I am ashamed of myself. I have been going to Gran Agave since they opened and this is the first time I am writing a review? Shame on me. I remember the first time I saw Gran Agave. I hoped in my heart that it was good. I knew it was authentic due to the originality of the name as well as the proper grammar in the name.  I. LOVE. THIS. MEXICAN. RESTAURANT.  I crave so many things at this restaurant. I try so many Mexican restaurants and I must say that this is not only one of the two top Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh metro, but it is also one of my favorite on the East Coast.  There has been a lot of recent change-outs in the servers, but many of them have been there for a while and most of them are super-friendly and helpful. Over the years, the items that we order over and over are:  Cheese Dip Chicken Soup: tomato, onion, avocado on the side Chicken Quesadilla Hard Taco: meat and cheese only Tacos De Carne Asada: Tomatillo Sauce on the side Hot Tamale Fundido: Tomatillo Sauce, No Cheese, Sour Cream on side Fajitas Gran Agave Gran Agave Burrito: Tomatillo Sauce, Steak Only, no lettuce, no cheese Carnitas  Don't worry about ordering anything spice (piquant) here. They will accommodate you, but it doesn't add any appreciable flavor. Nothing here is piquant and I don't care, the flavors are vibrant and abundant. You can get the spicier salsa, but it really only tastes of dried habanero and I am not a fan of most things habanero as it is usually just a very shallow taste.   There is a gradation of food here that goes from American to Mexican. The more American (stereotypical Mexican) your meal is, the more bland it will be. Get out of your comfort zone and order something more authentic. It will only help expand your culinary horizons and your happiness. While the more American food is somewhat bland, it is prepared in a way that allows the flavor of the ingredients to come through.   I am a fanatic when it comes to their salsa verde (tomatillo sauce). I love tomatillo sauce and Gran Agave has THE BEST tomatillo sauce I have eaten in years and the best one I can still purchase. This sauce is the antithesis of the traditional red sauce that you get at a Mexican restaurant and is authentic. I love the vibrancy and the acidity in the flavor. Ninety percent of the time I am ordering something with the tomatillo sauce, ie. carnitas, tamale fundido.etc.  I am also a fanatic when it comes to good tamales. I don't think people realize how difficult it is to find a good tamale. I never thought I would find a better tamale in Pittsburgh than I am able to find in Miami, but I did. Gran Agave's tamale, in my opinion, is second only to Los Cabos in Lawrenceville. Add that tomatillo sauce to the tamale to get the Hot Tamale Fundido, though, and I am in heaven.  While I personally tend to steer clear of the American foods, I must admit that I do enjoy the Fajitas Gran Agave. This is the signature fajita dish of this restaurant is is leagues above and beyond any of the other dishes. What makes this dish so much better? They add chorizo. Not just any chorizo, but a really tasty chorizo that imparts its flavor to everything else on the skillet. For those of you that don't know, chorizo is a spiced, Spanish sausage that can run from mild to very piquant.   I crave so many things at this restaurant that I know I will continue to make the journey. I would suggest that everyone try this restaurant at least once, especially considering it will make only a minor dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"I ate here today for lunch. I had lunch special number 5, which included a burrito and taco, $6. The meat used in both the taco and the burrito was really bland, but the burrito had some chile sauce on top that helped the flavoring a little.  The chips and salsa get an A in my book. The chips were warm and tasted fresh. I ordered the spicy salsa and it was super spicy with an excellent flavor - superb. My over sized water glass was empty very fast but it didn't take too long to get it refilled. I tried the lame gringo salsa that my companion was eating and it was not for me.   Overall it was a decent dining experience and a reasonable deal. Your alternative is to get a big mac meal for about the same price. Awk!  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Price = 4 Stars Service = 3 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4 Stars"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to find out that in that fake little village that is the Homestead Waterfront, there is an actual family-owned-and-operated restaurant among all the corporates.  It's right next to The Improv, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best place to have a meal before the show.  I've been there twice now, and even though I've been to some of the best Mexican restaurants in Southern California, this place made me smile.  Want a BIG margarita?  They've got'm.  BIGGER?  They've got'm.  A PITCHER OF MARGARITAS?  Yep, they've got'm.  Great service, an incredible selection of Tequilas that you've never heard of, and yes, really good margaritas. (on the rocks - not frozen.)  My experience with the food has been mixed.  The stuffed pablano peppers are awesome.  The fish tacos are superb.  The Carnitas Verde is THE BEST thing I've tried on the menu.  They came up short on their enchiladas.  I would have to say that either somebody blew it in the kitchen the night I had an enchilada, or they just don't know that there is more than just a change of tortilla that differentiates a burrito from an enchilada.  I was a little disappointed (but not surprised) to find out that the beef in the burritos and enchiladas is ground beef, and there didn't seem to be an option for shredded beef.  I will definitely be back to this place to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place was great. The food was very good and the employees were nice. We will be stopping back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Nooooooo!!  This was our favorite mexican place in town. It was great! And you couldn't beat their pitchers of sangria and margarita. This is a major bummer. They were always busy - What happened??????"}
{"text":"Ugh, not a fan.  First off, my husband and I had pretty awful service while the large, loud, drunken table next to us had at least three waiters pouring shots from tequila bottles at their table.  The place is pretty tiny, and I could barely hear myself think.  The food was bland and mediocre, and we ordered a huge mango margarita to share.  I'm not sure if it had alcohol in it at all, and it tasted like oranges.  (Maybe that other table didn't save any tequila for us.)  I would recommend this place only if you are here with a large group to party.  If you want to have a nice dinner with someone, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is reasonably priced but it is not that good. I ordered the Super Quesadilla with chicken and it was bland. On the side of it there were two cups of shredded lettuce, one tablespoon of guacamole and one or two small tomato slices. I could've made something better at home.   My one friend had ordered three tacos from the a la carte menu; those tacos were also unseasoned. The other friend enjoyed her chicken and bacon quesadilla. If it didn't have the bacon, I'm sure it would've been just as bland as mine.   As for the waitress, she wasn't on the ball at all. She got my friend's order wrong, she didn't refill our glasses, but she made sure she promptly brought us our bills that were difficult to decipher.  This was my first and last visit at Gran Agave. The decor is nice but everything else is overrated."}
{"text":"Mexican food is probably my favorite thing ever. It's a little disappointing that in Pittsburgh most people associate good Mexican food as only Mad Mex (even though I love me some Mad Amex).  The lunch portions for the price were generous and the service was great. The complimentary chips and salsa had a kick to it, but wasn't too spicy. We ordered the fajita and huevos rancheros lunch specials and both were very good.  The cleanliness of the tables was a little lacking when we first walked in, but didn't cause me to shy away from ordering food.  If you get hungry wandering around Homestead, do yourself a favor and pull into Grande Agave."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service, and decent prices.  TONS of food, which was awesome.  I didn't care for the cilantro-heavy salsa, but that's mostly me.  It was very loud, on account of a few highly intoxicated guys at the bar.    Good place to grab a bite in the shopping center that gets away from the chain joints."}
{"text":"My husband and i love it!!! Pittsburgh its really bad in mex restaurant. I think this one is the best in town!!  Madmex suckss! I had a really bad experience there."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good. My boyfriend liked his enchiladas. However I ordered the seafood quesadilla and was disappointed to find it full of nothing but imitation crab. There were several shrimp and scallop options on the menu so I expected some of that in there but got nothing but bland fake crab. Very misleading. The cheese was also barely melted, the tortilla was flabby and the dish itself was overpriced. It's like they were up charging for seafood that wasn't actually on the dish."}
{"text":"Good food, served quickly and accurately and fast to boot.  We love going here and I really enjoy it every single time.  The only reason I drop one star is that it lacks any sort of options that might even be considered  okay for you.  The food while delicious is pretty bad for you.    If you're counting calories head elsewhere.  Looking for a great way to cheat and get your pants sized worth?  You can do worse than here.  Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"There is truly a lack of good Mexican food in Pittsburgh and Agave doesn't really give itself anything to rave about. The service was good, the place is a good size and there was no wait on a Saturday night. These are all good things about this place. Bad thing, and the most important: The food just didn't cut it. I left, unsatisfied and craving better Mexican food.   The fi on the other hand loved it. Maybe I'm just too picky."}
{"text":"The food was great! The server was attentive. The restaurant is smaller than most, but they move quickly to get everyone seated."}
{"text":"Been there a lot of times great dishes great stuff always friendly always leave there full if your in the waterfront best Mexican spot to do"}
{"text":"I love mexican food and I have been to a Ton of Mexican restaurants.   The service was great but the food was not what I was hoping it would be.  The food was a Big Disappointment."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review with two things; 1) I know nothing about authentic Mexican food, and 2) I am not very brave, culinarily speaking. Having said both those things, the BF and I like it here. The atmosphere is right up my alley; aesthetically pleasing to the eye and not too boisterous.   I only will order a couple of things, but I really like those things. This night it was the Huevos con Chorizo (the other being the vegetarian sopes. SO good!) and it was pretty good. Usually it's just a lunch item, but they made an exception. It's chorizo and eggs and comes with rice, beans and tortillas. It's a really large portion and I made the rookie error of eating too much chips and salsa, so I couldn't eat most of it, but good none the less. The BF got a combo plate and was pretty happy with it too. It came with rice and beans as well. He likes the combo plates because you can get a variety of different things with a variety of meat fillings, i.e pork, chicken and beef all in one plate. I tasted his things- not a fan. I get people complaining about the blandness and things, but it there is a disclaimer of sorts that says (And I'm TOTALLY paraphrasing here) we cook our food mild to accommodate the masses, if you want it hot, we will make it hot. Like I said, not how they worded it but...for me, I do not like hot, so I'm fine with it.  I have never had a problem with the staff either. They may not be as open or chatty as other places, but for most of them English is not their born tongue, so that's to be expected. If you don't like that, go to MadMex. English or no, they are always polite and attentive. There is also a nice seating area outside in the little courtyard, in which I love to sit and watch the crazies of the Waterfront."}
{"text":"We were out doing some holiday shopping at the Waterfront and famished, decided to try Gran Agave out. My husband loves Mexican food so he was very excited to try them.   We arrived with our daughter in tow - she is in a stroller. They did not seem terribly happy to have to accommodate a stroller - they place is fairly small but at 2pm on a Sunday it was maybe half full.  We were seated and given menus and a basket of warm chips and what is presumably house made salsa. Both were outstanding.  I ordered a taco salad with beef tips and black beans and my husband ordered 3 beef soft tacos. The portions were huge - neither of us finished our meals.   He really liked his tacos well enough whereas my salad was pretty mediocre. The bottom of the tostada was completely soggy and the beef tips were in some thin, bland liquid that pretty much just felt like water. The whole thing was fairly bland, saved only by the salsa that I scooped over it.   We paid for our meal - very reasonably priced and went on our way... then a few minutes later we both felt absolutely horrible. My husband felt like he had lead in his belly and both of us felt completely nauseous. I turned to him and said I just wanted to vomit to get it out of me. A couple hours later when I am writing this I am still feeling very sick. I we agreed that is was easily the worst meal we'd ever had.  I'd not recommend this to anyone and will never go back and I am also really surprised by the number of positive reviews for this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good that my boyfriend had to limit how often we went so that we could try other places in Pittsburgh.  Just writing this makes me want to go there for dinner tonight.  Best Mexican food i've ever had.I love the Nachos Gran Agave, the Queso, the Taco Salad, and ALL of the Enchiladas are yummy.   And as for the margaritas....they are large and potent!  Mango is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty cool atmosphere.  I am not one for Mexican food simply because I try to stay away from carbs as much as I can, so coming here is kind of dumb for me, but I lost the majority vote when we went out to lunch.  I did find myself a very good shrimp cocktail soup thing.  It was pretty price though, but I will admit it was delicious.  I want to come here once I am 21 to have a margarita at the bar!  AY YA AYYAYA AY (Mexican screaming)."}
{"text":"This sounded like a much more interesting restaurant than it turned out to be.  The portions are huge however our server offered to make me a small plate. The sangria was good and we did not try margaritas but they were also huge. My cheese enchilada was fine but nothing to write home about. I was going to order a chili relleno but they make them with bell pepper instead of chilis and you can only get them with meat so I passed. The server was nice but they were understaffed and service was very slow.  If you want a lot of food for a decent price this may be for you but I will be in search of something more interesting."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles, California so I guess my expectations for Mexican food are a little high. My friend from Pittsburgh loves this restaurant... I went there two nights ago with my friend and ordered a seafood quesadilla, it was gross. I should have taken a picture of it. I opened the quesadilla and there was this big blog of sweet white cheese and imitation crab inside. My friend ordered fish tacos and she was not impressed. At all. The only thing we could agree on was the pico de gallo, that was decent. The best thing about this restaurant was that they had Jarritos. Gosh, I was so disappointed. Yesterday I went to Emiliano's (in South Side) and that definitely was a HUGE upgrade from Gran Agave."}
{"text":"After trying a number of Mexican places this week,  I went back to my tried and true Gran Agave.  Really,  I've never had a bad experience here and I've been here quite a number of times.  Sometimes for a meal and sometimes just for a snack after shopping at the Waterfront; which was the case tonight.   I had a seat at the small bar towards the back and was cheerfully greeted with a menu. I ordered a Dos Equis and was quickly served my beer with complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa was thick and tasty.   I ordered just two tacos and they arrived  within five minutes. Granted the place only had twelve other people but I've waited longer in other places for tacos when I was the only person there.  The tacos came filled heavy with beef and topped generously with cheese.  I used some of the salsa as a dressing on them to give them an extra kick.   I feel very fortunate to live only about a five minute drive from the waterfront where I can enjoy a place like this on a whim.  I would drive alot further for Mexican food of this caliber."}
{"text":"Pile o dog poo. Stick to a margarita. The food will make you stick your fist down your throat."}
{"text":"These guys have reasonably priced margaritas and they don't skimp on the tequila. I had a mango one and it was tasty! I also had a churro. I love churros but nowhere on the menu did it say these churros had filling. I didn't like the filling but I loved the outside and the cinnamon and sugar and how it married well with my ice cream. I've previously been here for tacos and it was okay cheap Mexican food. I love the service and the atmosphere and the location is awesome sauce. I will definitely be back for margaritas and try another dessert."}
{"text":"When that guacamole came out much sooner than anticipated and was rather smooth with nothing in the way of avocado chunks, cilantro, onions or tomatoes, I knew that disappointment was just a mile ahead. Prepared guacamole can be purchased, after all. In bulk. In...buckets.   At least the maize tortilla chips I used to scoop up the malachite baby food were passable.   The runny, watery salsa was not, however. Hell, I coulda had a V-8! Actually, I think I did, but it was poured into a rustic ceramic bowl and called salsa.   Onto my entree, Combo #30: The mealy ground beef that filled my burrito and enchilada was fit for cats. Stray cats. The corpse of a chalupa was found buried under shredded lettuce with a tomato wedge acting as a headstone, its cause of death believed to be lameness.   Kay's dessert, a serving of flan, was whale meat laced with caramel and vanilla extract.   Redemption almost occurred in the churros. Served with vanilla ice cream, the ribbed cinnamon/sugar crusted sticks of fried dough contained an apple filling, one that was a bit too tidy, leading me to suspect that they came from a box, even if they were the 2nd brightest moment of our Memorial Day lunch, the 1st being Kay's Black Bean Soup that when paired with the white rice became a hearty, tangy meatless stew.   Our server was cheery and friendly, and GA's decor is funky and whimsical enough to make it a decent enough spot for a few drinks if bar-haunting is something you enjoy, but damn, this just wasn't worth the drive. A take-over by Mad Mex would be a marked improvement, and I say that with absolutely no sarcasm aimed towards the local chain of which I am fond. Why Gran Agave garners more favorable reviews than Mad Mex boggles my brain and palate."}
{"text":"Update due to recent visit and not much has changed.  Food started with heated chips and salsa that was OK. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food your get.  Had a combo of taco and enchilada with refried beans.  The choice of meat was limited and ordered the beef which was very plain, lacking much taste.  The refried beens were OK."}
{"text":"This is not a place to take your snooty southern California friends, but I like the food here. There are only clean plates at my table.  However the service could be better. Get comfortable with doing the one finger wave. Just call them over for whatever you want and it'll be right up. If you don't say anything you won't get anything."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  In all fairness, I've only had the steak Burrito Gran Agave... But it was bad enough to keep me from ever coming back.  The burrito is the cheese burger of Mexican food.  Almost impossible to screw up.  I asked for cheese inside and nothing on top.  It was smothered in a cheese that tasted like white american.  No queso fresco in a Mexican joint?  And the steak was the saltiest thing I have ever eaten.  Like they prepared it to survive a long winter.  I told the waiter.. Who was just polite enough to avoid being rude.. He looked at me like I was crazy but did offer to have something else made for me.  I chose the mole poblano which I'm taking home for my roommate.  I don't like doing the whole comped meal thing."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! Authentic, great fresh food, atmoaphere, outdoor seating and you can't beat the price. It is much better than a few others around the city, especially the chains!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  What I've learned is never order queso fundido in Pittsburgh because it means something completely different here.  I came by here yesterday for lunch and the food was REALLY good.  My girlfriend and I had chips, one burrito, one taco, and veggie fajitas all for $16!  Best deal in Pittsburgh!  I feel like places here like to charge closer to $10 for a burrito which is absolutely ridiculous.  This is a good place if you want to sit down and relax while enjoying your meal.  It's not fancy but the food is good and they have a full bar.  Parking isn't tough and the service is friendly.  If you're a vegan or vegetarian they do have vegetarian beans and rice and a nice little vegetarian section on their menu."}
{"text":"We had to send my friends order back twice,  and it still wasnt right.  The menu described it has having melted cheese.  Unless there is a special kind of cheese that doesn't melt,  it wasn't heated enough.  Granted,  this was New Years day at 1pm or so.  I will likely give them another try when the waitstaff maybe isn't hungover."}
{"text":"30 minute wait on a Saturday night during prime time. By the time we were seated the restaurant had calmed down. Our waiter provided good service at the beginning of the meal but then towards the end he came by less frequent that other servers got us to go boxes and cleaned off our tables. I liked how they provided chips and salsa which had a kick. I settled on the carnitas and sadly I was disappointed. The rice and beans were good though I don't have high standards w/ anything with cheese but really the pork though was in mass quantities and was very overcooked. I had a lot of food left over and ended up eating the leftovers for lunch the next day and I had to force the meal down since I did not want to waste. I had high hopes for Gran Agave - my boyfriend loved his margarita and the carne asada and would go back in a heart beat. However seems I struck out that night."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for seven years, the last 3 years we lived there we probably ate here at least once a month. Excellent food and service. If Alejandro is working ask to be seated with him. He's the best!  I loved to come for lunch on Saturday. We always ordered the same thing. A side order tamales with meat and beans in a savory sauce over the top. An order of the queso dip which was made with an imported Mexican cheese and A HUGE Pina Colada. Not to mention the salsa is amazing. Everything is AMAZING here.   For entrees my husband always got the carne asada tacos. I always got the huevos con chorizo. BOTH are TO-DIE-FOR! We always had food to take home for another meal later.   I miss this place more than words now that we have moved back to Florida, which says A LOT about this place."}
{"text":"I literally stuffed myself like it was my last meal on earth. I think it was because I was massively hungry, but when you have good Mexican food in front of you, it's hard not to shove it in your face. And that I did my friends...  Starting with the ritual of gorging myself with chips and salsa. The chips were freshly baked (not sure if they were house made, but it wasn't tostitos time up in herre) and the salsa had a kick. We also ordered up a side of gauc to compliment said gorging. While I enjoy chunky salsa and gauc more, I thought the salsa was way better. Skip the gauc, it was okay, but nothing special.   For the main meal I ordered the Shrimp Fajita Salad. It was brought out in what looked like a massively over sized taco shell with all the fixings. Plump shrimp, grilled peppers and onions and enough gauc and sour cream to drown yourself in. I was game. So I ate almost the entire thing, minus the shell, because at that point I was all taco'd out. It was really delicious. If you make somehow make Mexican without flavor, you're doing something wrong. They are doing a-okay here. Side note, I doubt this was by any means a \"healthy\" salad.  I was a bit surprised to see most of the taco's are chicken and beef only, with no substitution. But there are many many choices in the combo section, so I think every palate will be satisfied. Or just come hungry and eat everything on the menu. That's what I felt like I did. Then I was rolled out of the place..."}
{"text":"Not too bad. The service was fast, no small talk. Order. Box? Check. If he's okay with it, then I am too.  The complimentary chips and salsa was as expected, but we did order a side of queso which was tasty. I ordered the vegetarian sopes since it was the first time I've seem them offered in a Mexican restaurant. I can't say that I loved it, rather it was alright. The cornmeal shells were dense, but good. The 'special sauce' could best be described as a bland tomato sauce... almost like a spaghetti sauce. Also, it had sprinkled cheese on it, Parmesan? Couldn't tell you.   My companion ordered one of the combination platters - included a chile relleno, taco, and enchilada. For some reason, we couldn't find the chile relleno. There was a puddle of cheese (with a ton of oil resting on top), but no relleno. How mysterious.   Would we go back? Probably."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for a decent price. Interesting vibe to the place. Food is pretty good.   Haven't had the DD yet to be able to try the 60oz delicious looking margaritas."}
{"text":"Gran Agave is definitely in my top three Mexican restaurants in the burgh.  Atmosphere:   The restaurant itself isn't huge, but it's festively decorated, with plenty of seating.  Weekends are very popular, and they don't take reservations.  So I suggest checking it out on weeknight or for lunch.  Staff: Amazing!  They are very attentive, and know their customer.  They are always willing to please, and I've never had bad service here.   Food: Of course this is why we go.  Delicious, fresh, and authentic.  I always order the chicken fajitas, or the chicken mole.  First of all the portions are HUGE.  My fiance and I typically share a platter and an appetizer.  Their chips are fresh, and the salsa is extremely good.  I've never had a bad experience with the food here.  Like they say in their menu, Mexican food is not spicy.  However being the Indian I am...I always ask for hot sauce, and they are always willing to oblige.  They have a house-made habanero sauce, that you can ask for by special request.  It's deadly good."}
