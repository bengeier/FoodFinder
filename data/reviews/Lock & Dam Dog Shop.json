{"text":"We were so excited to see this place had reopened! We had the cheese fries , a strawberry milkshake and a hot fudge sundae.  All were very good. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Enjoyed talking to them. To the side of the building there are picnic tables that look over the river and the dam. A vista unlike any other    When I got home a had an email receipt from them asking for feedback. I called them to ask how they got my email and they said thru my online banking because I used my debit card to pay. Never happened anywhere before when I used my debit card. They did not  ask me if they could use my email which is the usual etiquette . Something disturbing about that. I would take a star or two away from my review because of this if I could ."}
{"text":"Don't keep driving past this place like I did....Doesn't matter if you love hotdogs or hamburgers this place WILL NOT disappoint! I had the Chicago Dog and it was freakin fabulous! Had a chance to stop by the other day and decided to try a burger....Burg-a-licious! Need I say more?!?!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but a little bit wary based on some middling reviews. I think anyone who gave a negative review was just ornery or didn't understand how Square works. (See the person who complained that the restaurant somehow \"stole\" their email address...) I love hotdogs and have been searching Pittsburgh for the best hotdog spot for a while. I have been disappointed with the cleanliness, quality, consistency, and originality of every other place I've been to, including perennial favorites like Weiner World and that 24 hour place in Oakland. This place, however, was great from start to finish. It was clean. There's a great view. There was indoor seating. Even the bathroom was clean. The service was incredible. The staff was very attentive and patient. They came over to ask us how things were after we had gotten our meal. And before that when we were ordering we kept screwing up and changing our order and the young man behind the counter was incredibly patient and understanding about it. I got a \"build my own\" hot dog with relish, ketchup, and grilled onions. My husband got the Carolina. We both got combos. I've seen some people complain about the price, but I have no idea how you could complain about getting fries with any topping, a loaded hotdog, and a bottled artisan soda for 8. No, it might not be rock-bottom cheap, but it is definitely not overpriced. And the quality is excellent. As for the hotdogs themselves, I absolutely loved mine. Thick, flavorful, juicy. Nicely cooked. The bun was moist and fresh. The grilled onions were fresh and delicious. And the relish appeared to have been homemade. It was excellent. My husband also really liked his hotdog. The fries were fine. They weren't the best in town as claimed. But it's more of a preference thing. These were crusty on the outside and had been fried for a little longer than I might've liked. But it was clearly intentional--just a style that some people really like. They had lots of flavor. I just prefer fries that don't have that thick crispy exterior. It tends to retain grease. Of course, that didn't stop my husband or me from eating most of our fries. We finished the meal with some soft serve ice cream cones. The ice cream was good, much better quality then a lot, but certainly not the best I've had. But definitely up there. The small was very generously sized. And once again, the staff were quick and attentive. I would absolutely go back here, and I would recommend it for any hot dog connoisseurs or anyone who wants a fun casual spot with a great retro vibe. The decor was really quite fun. Even though it was raining, we went outside after afterward to enjoy the epic view of the Allegheny River, and the dam. A very nice spot indeed."}
{"text":"I had a bacon burger and my son had a chili dog...both were excellent! Boylan sodas made it even better."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place t sit down and have a good burger or hotdog. They prices are really nice and the service is amazing. The food doesn't take very long either and the food always comes out hot. I would very much recommend this place to anyone looking to get a good burger/hotdog."}
{"text":"First time here.had the junkyard Burger combo the burger was the best I think I've ever had. I will come back."}
{"text":"I drive by this place once a week, but only early in the morning.  I've always wanted to try it, so fortunately the lines for food were way too long at the zoo today, so we went here when we were done.  They had very good hot dog and burgers.  Burgers were better than average, and the hot dog was way above average for sure.  Shakes were decent, and the fries were good, but they were the coated type, which I prefer more traditional fries.  We got a large fries, and 3 of use couldn't even finish them.  Wish this place was a little closer to home, because I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place many times and finally made a stop in today after a trip to the Zoo. The place is super clean and staff are really friendly. I ordered the Junkyard burger without the bacon and fries. It was really good and I loved the fried pickles on it. It looked like they had a lot of milkshake choices so I plan to stop in to get one next time. Burger and fries were filling."}
{"text":"These dogs are fantastic. Make sure you give the Carolina, Chicago, and bacon Mac n cheese dog a try. The bottled soda is a great touch. The fries and pretzels are also unique with great flavor. If you are heading to waterworks or the zoo give it a whirl you won't be dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I am a hot dog fanatic, I love a good hot dog and will go out of my way to find a place that sells, if not anything else, a hot dog.  I have had this place bookmarked for months and finally had a chance after running morning errands to finally hit this place up.  I arrived around the lunch hour and found this place to be nearly deserted.  I chalk that up to the fact that we have been having yo-yoing weather the past couple of days and maybe people take advantage of the outdoor seating.  When you walk in you are greeted by the old time diner vibe.  Those retro colors and chrome like accents are everywhere in here.  Ordering is an easy task to do, but being my first time here I took my time to look over the menu that changes.  Evidence of this is that the chalkboard menus that you see in these pictures are nothing like what they were when I was in here just a few days ago.  I will put this out there right now.  I did not try any other food items offered asides from the hot dog and fries itself.  So I cannot attest to things such as the Vienna all beef hot dog, hamburger or any of the ice creams (really wish I would have tried some ice cream especially since they have all the machinery to make a kick ass milkshake).  What I did end up trying here was the foot long hot dog combo.  The pricing here, at least to me, is by far better than most other places.  I see a lot of people complaining about the prices of a single hot dog.  I assume these people do not realize the quality of a hot dog definitely effects the pricing.  These aren't your common variety of grocery store hot dogs we are talking about here.  Also, maybe they should have tried the combo.  Speaking of the combo, one of the best combos I have come across in any restaurant I have come across (I mean, for a hot dog combo that is).  If you want, you can go plain Jane on your dog and top it with the traditional mustard or ketchup.  But I must implore upon you to try one of their topping combos that are already figured out for you.  I went with the Bacon Mac topping for myself.  It kind of takes you back to when you were younger and decided to add a hot dog to your mac n cheese.  So simplistic, yet satisfying.  It was a great thing that they served this with a fork, made for easy clean up of any of the toppings that fell off.  The fries had an amazing crisp to them.  No need for dipping because of how flavorful they were.  To round out the combo, pick from the cooler for any beverage you might want.  As for the price of the behemoth lunch, $8 and change.  AMAZING!  You almost had to roll me out of here after I finished this.  *Cards accepted.  Food pick up at the window.  Outdoor seating.  Restrooms for customers only and are located outside and require a key.  Take in the view of the river as you dine outside."}
{"text":"While it is an infallible truth that the best dogs are served with stadium mustard in a ballpark in late October (In Chicago is debatable, not enough data points),  one must always search for that special place to have Spring training!  In that pursuit, Pittsburgh is quite blessed.  As with MLB, where you can have an NL and AL team to root for,  Lock and Dam has become my NL favorite.  The Grunge dog I tried today is quite unique, grilled onions, sour cream and jalape√±o!  Delicious!  Also of note is the friendly staff, well versed in Pittsburgh lore and did I mention ice cream for dessert.  Located in Morningside, on the river next to the Highland Park bridge, a very pleasant stop.  Give them a try and celebrate Spring!  Batter up!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome and right across from the Zoo. The Western Dog was tasty. My daughter had the Bacon Mac Dog. She demolished it. They have ice cream, milk shakes and sundaes here which looked popular. We had ice cream at the Zoo so, we didn't sample that. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great dogs and interesting topping choices. Beer battered fires, really good cheese sauce. I approve. A little costly for dogs, but i can deal for good food and good people."}
{"text":"The actual hotdogs itself had good snap and taste, but $5 for that size dog is way out of hand... $15 for 3 dogs, two people, ridiculous! The Chicago dog was just good and the chili dog was average at best. Barely any cheese in one, too much on the other,  chili was bland."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch stops in city also better than zoo food. Order a chilli cheeseburger, you can't go wrong! Also the Chicago dog (both Vienna and footlong) is wonderful. Also a great selection of bottled sodas!!! I have not tried ice cream if milkshakes but I assume they are wonderful too!!! I find myself driving out of my way often to visit for great food at a very fair price!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for lunch and I highly recommend coming here for food before you grab a little bit of ice cream this summer. The hot dogs are super fire, I highly suggest the grunge dog with cream cheese jalepenos and onions (and bacon) or the junkyard burger which has among other things fried pickles and a tasty house burger sauce. Grab a combo and have a glass bottle of soda from the cooler, talk to the folks that work there, front and back of house are as friendly as can be. Go now, and go often! It's a local gem."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out Lock & Dam Dogs today.  When I first entered I noticed the joint looked clean which is always a good thing, for a place I will soon be ordering food from.    I ordered two dogs (Chicago Dog & Carolina Dog) and a medium soda.  The dogs were OK, but nothing really special.  I would have liked to see a poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog, and a little more flavor in both the slaw and chili of the Carolina.  Prices are a bit on the high side for the size of dog ($4.95 + tax each) and the medium soda (Pepsi mostly ice $1.40).  All in all, it wasn't bad, I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for hot dogs and ice cream in the city. Clean, friendly service, and a nice selection of unique dogs. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Had a Hawaiian dog here today and it left a lot to be desired. It was almost $10 for a combo with fries and a small fountain drink. The hotdog itself was rather small, but tasted good.The combination of cold hoisin sauce, tiger sauce, canned pineapple, and shredded coconut did not work at all. For the same price, you can get a really good hotdog at Franktuary down the road a bit."}
{"text":"My lunch at Lock & Dam was probably one of the best meals out I've had since moving to Pittsburgh seven months ago. It's in a totally unassuming store front across the street from the zoo- which is how my family and I ended up there. Post-zoo we were starving and my husband had heard that the food at Lock & Dam was supposed to be really good. I don't think he was prepared for HOW good it was, though. I certainly wasn't.   My husband ordered a hot dog with mac n cheese on it, I ordered a Junkyard burger, and we ordered our two year old his very first cheeseburger. The first thing we noticed, when we brought the tray to the table, was that the food served for the price paid was beyond fair. Huuuuge burgers and dogs stacked high with premium toppings. I honest-to-G-d let out a satisfied moaning sound as a bit into this burger. I was like, beyond hungry at this point and I couldn't believe my good luck at what I was eating. Picky toddler even went HAM on his burger and, like I said, he has about five meals he will reliably eat... none of which are hamburgers lol.  The cherry on top of the experience was the business owner, who also cooked our food that afternoon. He was the most pleasant person who checked in with us about how we were enjoying our meal and genuinely seemed pleased that we thought it was so delicious. I don't want to blow up the spot, but he even gave us a couple little extras on the house that sweetened the experience even further.  There's really no question in our minds that we will be returning to have lunches at Lock & Dam every time we find ourselves having family day at the zoo. We have a zoo membership and spring and summer are right around the corner so I'm sure I'll be working my way through that burger menu.  Get yourself here, ASAP!"}
