{"text":"Great food, a bit pricey but excellent service and atmosphere. Fantastic food and the server was super nice and professional."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is very mediocre but the service was quite fast.  Ordered a filet mignon medium rare without bacon - the first time they gave me my steak wrapped in bacon, I pointed out the mistake and the waiter changed my plate for a filet mignon without bacon... but cooked very rare.  Overall, the service was okay, our waiter was very nice but the food is just simply not that tasty. Better communication in the kitchen (and better chefs) would improve the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, attentive service, nice decor and very attractive wait staff (:p)  A go-to place to get a steak and catch up with friends downtown after a long day of work."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the ribeye was good. However, the prime rib was tasteless, the half a serving of crab was overcooked and salty and the sides were disappointing (asparagus was plain and bitter, mashed potatoes were just ok, fried shoestring potatoes were greasy and tasteless (prime rib was plated with them, we did not order them), French fries tasted as if they were reconstituted although we we're told they were fresh cut).  We were looking for a nice last meal before our flight home. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Mon met favori est le Steak. Partout où je vais, j'essaie les Steak House. Le Keg fait parti de mon top à Montréal. Excellent rapport qualité prix et surtout, excellent service en général."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about the Keg.  Went for my wife's birthday last night and the staff made her feel  like a rock star.  The food was mind-blowingly good.  Highly recommended for steak lovers by someone that rarely gives 5 stars.  I had the bleu cheese crusted filet mignon and it was as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The food is great,  The service is impeccable, And the restaurant is elegant. Great experience and outsanding food."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for my birthday, and I really enjoyed my experience there. My steak was done medium rare as I requested and it was juicy and delicious, so were the sides. The service was pretty quick, but there weren't too many people to be honest. We stayed outside in the terrace, the place is huge and really nice, and the service was great. Not the cheapest place, but hey its a steakhouse."}
{"text":"The keg caught my eye when I was in Vancouver when I was only 13, simply for the fact that they cooked my steak the way I want it cooked, rare.  Flash foward a few years to a vacation in Montreal.  I happen to walk past the old Keg and found out there is one that is located right by my hotel.    The appitizers were very good.  Yet the steaks were simpley the best.  I have been to other major steak houses such as Ruth Chris but I prefer the Keg.  The steaks are just soo tender.  The desserts are very good to, from what I remember I got the Billy Miner.  I would say this is my favorite steak house my a large margin.  I wish they would open up one in the NYC area, I would visit it a lot."}
{"text":"My favorate steak house!Prices very reasonable for what you are getting and service always nice!worth the wait"}
{"text":"The concierge of the Hilton almost insited that we go there. Since it was just around the corner and we were really up for a good steak we took his advice. The first impression was a high price steak house.  After a short time we got our table.   Second impression: high class, moderate prices, and exellent food quality. Also the waitresses were very observing. We came back the next day already!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in mid afternoon after arriving to our hotel and were in search of food. French onion soup was delicious and had a great blackened sirloin. Service was really good, friendly and knowledgeable servers."}
{"text":"For some reason I never went to the Keg before. Good thing too, I have saved so much money by not knowing of this place. It's now my favorite steakhouse in Montreal. King Crab Rib steak and even the well priced kids meals. I also have to mention the awesome service every time. These guys do it right."}
{"text":"Steakhouse. Dropped in here for a little dinner. Service was good, but the steak cannot be compared to the ones at American steakhouses like Smith & Wollensky, Sparks etc. A steakhouse, nothing overwhelming, but ok!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service was very good. Waiter came to see us many times and at one point even the chef, even after paying. Quite impressive."}
{"text":"The Keg is always a safe bet and this one did not disappoint! Staff were wonderful and very accommodating!  My go-to for steak."}
{"text":"very expensive and busy. Good selection of wine and food was good. Stuffy atmosphere but I had quality for the money I paid."}
{"text":"GREAT LUNCH PLACE! When people hear \"The Keg\", it's likely their mind goes right to \"supper\". No doubt The Keg at suppertime is something special but it also happens to be great at lunch too! I had their Prime Rib Sandwich recently and Prime those ribs were. The meat was tender and the ciabatta bread it came with was toasted to near perfection. Our waiter was very friendly. Not too overbearing & our group even enjoyed some small talk with him. Great lunch wine selection too, if you're not a \"wine at lunch\" type of person - you'll easily be converted at The Keg!"}
{"text":"Super STEAKHOUSE, ambiance feutrée, prix assez élevé mais la qualité est là ...."}
{"text":"I planned my buddy's bachelor party in Montreal and had originally planned to hit Moishe's, but they couldn't seat our party (10) until 9:45pm. I did some looking around when we got to Montreal and came across The Keg, or as the sign currently states at this location The Ke; apparently someone was _really_ in need of a G. After one phone call I found out they didn't take reservations, but did do priority seating and would do their best to accommodate us and accommodate they did. We had an excellent table, 2 outstanding servers and some excellent food. No idea who Billy Miner is, but he has some damn good pie named after him. Also, if you're a scotch drinker the extra 1oz/30ml at half price is a pretty bangin' deal. I will without a doubt return to this particular location on my next trip through Montreal."}
{"text":"Prime rib is good.. One of the main reason why I come here.. Def.. A plus that its accessible underground from the hotel where I am staying."}
{"text":"I travel the world in search of the best steak. This was straight-up the best Prime-Rib I've ever had. Ate at the bar, bar-tenders took excellent care of me. Packed on a Monday night, make reservations or go early."}
{"text":"Went there 9/18/16. The server was outstanding. The NY Strip was perfect. The prime rib was out of this world! This will be a recurring spot whenever I come to Montreal. Expensive, but beyond worth it."}
{"text":"Prices, food, staff all deserve 5 stars. Group dinner for 18 all were happy with their meal."}
{"text":"I took my father here for dinner. It's stylish setting is a solid location for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Keg has always been a favorite of mine and never disappoints.  We came here for a friend's birthday dinner when in Montreal for the weekend and had an amazing meal.  We had a great server, who was very attentive but still let us take our time and enjoy our meal.  We ordered cocktails and the crab and spinach dip to start - so delicious!  From there we moved on to red wine and steak for our mains.  I had the blue cheese filet with a twice baked potato and it was amazing.  I was sooo full but had to keep eating!  Our server also suggested a great red wine that I had never had before but I will look out for in the future as I really enjoyed it!  At the end of our meal, they brought out a piece of ice cream cake with a sparkler for the birthday girl (complimentary) which was a really nice touch and very appreciated by all of us!  I have been to quite a few Kegs in different cities and this one has to be one of my favorites - it has very modern and updated décor and comes off classier than some others I have been to in the past.  Overall, I definitely recommend this Keg as it is a reliable menu you can count on, great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"It's the Keg.  Keg + guaranteed amazing. Fantastic server, super kid-friendly, bacon wrapped scallops were fantastic, and salad servings were ginormous."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of different Keg Steakhouses around Canada, but I would not return to this one.  The food was good, but the service was horrible.  I've been to the Keg in Old Montreal many times, which is always a great experience.  Friendly staff and good food.  Here at Place Ville-Marie... it was a different story.  The staff was plentiful, young, attractive and bored.  They all stood around chatting and flirting with one another instead of attending to customers.  The worst part were the hosts/hostesses.  They were plain rude and upset that we were carrying large bags.  They wanted us to check them.  Ridiculous - there was lots of space at the tables, and the restaurant was half empty.  We received a lot of attitude.    I will never be back at this location!  When in Montreal, go to the one located at the Old Port instead.  So much better."}
{"text":"Interior decor is great, just like any other Keg. Experienced bad service. Food wasn't served as per the order and waitress tried to justify and downplay, don't think will go again. Tried Salmon, it was average."}
{"text":"I was craving steak for a while. And the prime rib picture on the website got me all excited.  I ordered it medium rare , she took a sirloin.  The steak was okay. Maybe I should have shown the picture to the lady haha .  Nevertheless , stuffed potatoes was amazingly done  , crispy stuff on the side and the sauce too  Atmosphere is amazing  I got to switch my horrible seat to a  \"salon\" type of one. The Wi-Fi was great.  I would go again to try the one on the picture .  Lady answers well my questions regarding tender meat."}
{"text":"Excellente place pour manger un steak. Le personnel est courtois, les prix sont étudiés, l'ambiance est chaleureux (pas bruyant)"}
{"text":"Ambiance intimiste, nous avons été servis rapidement et comme des rois. Les plats sont très goûteux et copieux. On a testé le crabe, le homard et un poulet thaï. Le filet mignon au lard et le newyork sirloin étaient parfaits. bref un très bon moment de dégustations en famille. Le service est personnalisé, on prend bien soin de vous durant votre court mais savoureux \"séjour\". De plus ils bénéficient d'un large choix d'apéritifs ce qui pourrait en ravir certains. Il faut y mettre le prix. On espère pouvoir revenir ici très vite !"}
{"text":"So, so...We expected more. The place is just a regular steak house food, but with limited side offerings. The stuffed  mushroom appetizer was very good.  My sirloin steak was over seasoned. A lot of pepper. And over cooked. Service was slow. Next time we'll try another place."}
{"text":"Excellent steak. Nourriture de bonne qualité et pour toutes les bourses (ça va du filet mignon au simple hamburger, mais tant qu'à être là, allez-y pour le steak ou le filet mignon, gâtez-vous un peu !).   Ce resto semble être un choix classique pour les lunchs de départ de bureau : ça fait trois fois que je m'y retrouve dans ces circonstances pour le départ d'un(e) collègue. Et chaque fois à la même table ! (C'est d'ailleurs la seule critique que j'ai à faire : ils semblent placer systématiquement les groupes de plus de 12 personnes dans le fond du restaurant, à un endroit peu éclairé et où les gens arrivés en 13e, 14e et plus doivent s'asseoir sur des banquettes à l'écart du groupe principal - bref, arrivez tôt aux lunchs de départ ! De plus, c'est un peu triste d'être en pleine obscurité quand il fait beau soleil à l'extérieur.)  Le service est lent (oups, deuxième critique ;) ), alors vaut mieux avoir du temps devant soi. Par contre, le personnel est courtois (et agréable à l'oeil !), alors on pardonne. Et, comme la bouffe est meilleure qu'à beaucoup d'autres endroits du coin, on ne se plaindra pas trop."}
{"text":"One of the better steakhouses in the city. I like the ambience and the complimentary salad, bread and sides that go with their steaks. The fact one can watch sports is an added plus."}
{"text":"Location is key for this iteration of the Keg formula. I went on a Sunday night...no hockey game, all the shops closed, the downtown core almost empty with a minus 25 chill blowing through the PVM plaza, yet at 5:30 a 45 minute wait for a table. Luckily, my companions arrived at 5:15 and already had a table. (They don't take reservations). Swanky is a good word for the vibe, but the clientele doesn't reflect that particular feeling. It was more like Howard Johnston's family crowd, understandable for a early Sunday dinner. I get that they pull people from the Queen E Hotel across the street. Still, the low light, minimalist decor, and the lovely young women in little black dresses create a certain cognitive dissonance for one's dinning experience. As for the food, two out of four orders at the table scored big disappointments. My Keg Classique sirloin was blue when ordered medium rare and was sinewy. I had to cut it as thin as possible to not end up with a sore jaw. On a positive note, the pepper whiskey sauce was very tasty. The Kansas City cut ended-up on my host's plate in a mangled mess. He remarked to the waiter that the butcher needed to be replaced. I don't know if it was the providence of the beef or its preparation or lack thereof, but it's been a while since I worked so hard to eat a piece of steak. The well-adorned baked potato was a welcome respite from my laboured mastication. The \"sorry about that\" came to the table in the form of a comped piece of the ice cream cake. It was delicious. The blueberry tea was served with Black tea instead of Orange Pekoe which changes the taste considerably...it was reported that either the Amaretto or the Grand Marnier was missing. The service is professional and the process of getting dinner was great, but the product I was served left quite a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING experience here. The food was absolutely delicious, you get what you pay for and more. The service was amazing. My boyfriend and i sat at the bar while we waited for our table but decided just to eat at the bar instead. Best decision. The bartenders; i believe their names were Ben and Marie, were absolutely amazing. They went above and beyond. Quick service, we never had to wait long for anything. They bartenders were fun and gave us a piece of cake and shots for my birthday. The manager came over and talked to us after, he was also a very pleasant man.   Overall, great experience, great service, great food. This place is a must if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I think the job application for this place must say \"models and former models only\". The wait staff is beautiful.    The NY Strip steak was delicious and cooked perfectly! You would have to be crazy to order anything else.    The only thing that annoyed me about this place is that they tell you don't need a reservation, but don't mention that you will probably have to sit outside.    Steak is so temperature dependent I found myself rushing it eat it before the breeze made it cold.    On the plus side some of the tables out side have awesome leather couches that a super comfortable to sink into after a big meal.  Major bonus.    On a warm night outside gets five stars all the way. On a cooler night you are going to face a multi-hour wait to sit inside."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse with a great menu including steaks, chicken, and seafood.  The food was great and service was excellent.  The wine list and cocktail menu was also very good."}
{"text":"Traveling throught town, food is good but the spacing of some of tables needs to be rearrange to be more spacious and not confined. Steak was good and done correctly."}
{"text":"Not highly recommended unless you are stuck in downtown and opting for a steak from a chained restaurant. The Keg at PVM is just over rated because it's convenient for people to go directly after work. The sirloin steak and prime rib steak are always too salty than it should be. Most of the times, if you order a steak at medium rare, what happened to me always, that the steak became out medium (over cooked).  Salmon filet not recommended for this price. I personally find that people going to this place aim at its ambiance and conveninence, not the new food quality nor the price."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of friends for a bachelor party. Although the policy of no reservation but waitlist priority had me worried, we actually sat right away and had a great meal. The portions are huge and you definitely get your moneys worth. Good selection of wine but prices were kind of on the high side. Wish there was more beer on draft. The waitstaff was very attentive especially when serving such a large group. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very well run restaurant. Welcoming reception staff. Excellent wait staff. Reasonable prices. Comfortable booths. The \"classic\" menu combination which included a salad or soup, main course, mushrooms, and one more side dish represents good value. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Förutsatt att du inte har allt för svårt för unga kvinnor med väldigt stor byst som serverar dig så kan detta ställe absolut rekommenderas. Ok, det är inte så illa som på the Hooters i USA men dock. Här öppnar du med en gin(hendricks)&tonic i baren och beställer sedan in en steak till maten och den är helt enkelt jävligt bra. Stället andas trendigt, hippt och affärsfolk möter trendiga designer kids. Till förrätt väljer du förslagsvis salladen med jordgubbar, nötter och annat."}
{"text":"There was a time when The Keg was my to go date spot. I knew that watevah I ordered would be scrumptious. Well that's all a distant memory now. I went about 3 times this year , and none of these times made me change to a positive feel.   Anyways on my most recent visit back in late April, I ordered a salad with lobster and shrimps. Boy was I dissapointed the salad.  I won`t even start with the lobster because I could find it. As for the shrimps they were so small. 21$ I didn't even understand why a salad would cost so much. They could have at least added some  tiger shrimps or something come on guys using ``crevettes matane``type shrimps??? Anyways my friend ordered a 12 oz NY steak 34$ came with a  baked potatoe just sad. The portion was ridiculously small. Service was super long.  So these 2 plates , 2 drinks and 1 shooter came 81$. I don`t mind paying big bucks for a good meal, but this ain`t it! I was still hungry and so was my friend.   Don`t know if ill go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner with my mom during a visit to Montreal and it was great. We got there around 6pm on a Friday night and it was busy but there was no wait, which was great. Walking to our table in the dining room we couldn't help commenting on how dark it was- almost too dark.  The menu looked amazing and they had a nice wine list. I ordered an Italian red and it was delicious. The only potential downside to the wine experience is that the waiter didn't give me a small pour to taste first, he just filled my 9oz glass. Had I not been happy with the wine it would have been an awkward situation to send it back after a full pour- but in this case it was fine.    Neither one of us were starving and the starters looked incredible so we decided to split two starters and an entree. Our starters were the calamari (which came with a Thai dipping sauce and a feta dipping sauce which were equally good and we couldn't stop alternating) and the tuna tartare (which was served with avocado was super fresh and not at all saucy). We were so happy with the starters that we couldn't wait to get our entree which was the bacon wrapped chicken stuffed with asiago.  The entree is the reason this got 4 stars not 5. The chicken was dry and there was a very thin layer of cheese on the bottom of the chicken that was undetectable unless you were examining the chicken for the cheese. This is a steakhouse so next time I come here I'll skip the chicken and try the steak, but I was disappointed with the chicken dish. The sides were good with the chicken (potatoes and asparagus purée) but weren't enough to save the dish."}
{"text":"dinner recently, wow doe this place get busy fast.....ate at the bar, and service was pleasant and interesting, food was good and i actually had a filet (it's been a while) which was very tasty, get very noisy and busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Seul point négatif : L'attente. Il FAUT une réservation le vendredi/samedi. Sinon, tu dois manger au bar, c'est correct, mais pas la '' full experience ''   Le steak est tout simplement sublime, même la pièce la moins chère a 23$. Les cocktails sont sublimes, essayez les martinis. Les serveurs/serveuses sont calés dans le domaine et peuvent vous diriger vers le drink qui vous conviendra.   Essayez aussi la pomme de terre Monte Carlo, la meilleure a vie.   Pour le prix, c'est le meilleur steak a Montréal."}
{"text":"Very very good steak and salad !!! I had a cobb salad it was amazing !! Very nice decor and terrace outside.  recommend it !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, awesome food and drinks, costs a pretty penny but you pay for what you get. Service is a delight great ambiance very classy yet casual. Perfect night out for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Really god in the evenings to share a wine ans cheeses with someone special Nice to have a supper in the end of a hard day  Not too relaxing if you don't have reservation, But is not a big deal anyways  Service, menu and ambiance, is a goal."}
{"text":"Yum. I just love the keg.  Food is yummy Service is fast Servers are friendly Prices are decent  What else can you ask for??"}
{"text":"I was for a long time planning to dine at The Keg Today I treated my wife and I with a memorable dinner for a lovely occasion  We both chose classics and picked the sirloin stake, mine medium rare It was fantastic, very properly cooked, flavored and decorated. Baron Philipe's glass of red wine matched the steak beautifully I had a choice of salad and side dish, i took Caesar and double baked potato with bacon. Both acceptably delicious  Finally the dessert, crime brûlée! Voilà! Could not be better Staff: friendly and helpful Ambiance: romantic, under lit (i do enjoy it) Wait time: on a Tuesday we had to wait 20 mins. It was fully packed. U can always reserve  Highly recommended after having ordered steak in many Montreal restaurants this for sue is number one so far"}
{"text":"I have been comming here dor years now, they are always on the spot, service is impacable, a++++"}
{"text":"It's a chain and expensive for what it is. Wedge salad was disappointing and the filet wasn't worth the price.   If you have the option of going to Gibby's  or even Ruebens, your better off. It's not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Food is expensive but really good. They also have a great choice of wines (mostly from California). We had a really good dinner there. Lobster is excellent. Perfect service."}
{"text":"It's the second time that my buddy and I went to this place... First time it was for happy hour on a Thursday night sometime in January and back a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night to watch the game in the bar section.  Food is ok, but nothing fantastic for the price and the bar section is crammed against a wall and I don't feel it gets the space and love that it should get.  Not going back anytime soon.  === Additional comment:  I'll give it another shot in a warmer month.  I don't think that this is going to help much for the bar section when trying to watch a game, but I promise to try it!"}
{"text":"Rien à redire sur le Keg Steakhouse. Je connaissais l'endroit depuis un moment, mais je n'y étais jamais allé, ayant mes habitudes ailleurs. J'ai fini par essayer et je suis ravi.  Le service était impeccable. Rapide, mais pas oppressant du tout. Les serveurs travaillaient en équipe et ils semblaient tous heureux d'être là, il doit y avoir une bonne ambiance de travail.  La viande était merveilleuse. Le menu offre un bon choix, de très classique à plus moderne. J'ai prix le contre-filet New York avec sauce au poivre et ma conjointe le filet avec pacanes et fromage de chèvre. Tout était succulent, la cuisson était exactement ce que nous voulions (saignant).  Le restaurant était bien plein, mais nous n'avons jamais attendu nos plats ni les serveurs, tout s'est très bien passé.  Le Keg est au même prix que d'autres chaînes de steak house qui, selon moi, lui sont inférieures. Très chaudement recommandé.  Les desserts étaient très bons, ce qui est rare dans une steak house."}
{"text":"Really nice Steakhouse. The food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly. We will come back as soon we are back in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Now one of my favourite restaurants.  To start we arrived at maybe 5:30 and were told we may be waiting for about 30 minutes already! It ended up being about 15 minutes but in the meantime we were brought 2 free entree tasters. The entire service was impeccable.  I had the teriyaki sirloin in rare and my boyfriend had this special \"limited time\" menu, he got a steak with pesto and brie. Both were amazing and perfectly cooked. We had a side of rice pilaf, very good. We also took an entree of mushroom neptune and a small passionfruit creme brulee. Everything was absolutely divine. Although pretty expensive it was totally worth it and I am looking forward to going again.  The ONLY negative point is that it was very loud, but there seemed to be some party going on near the bar."}
{"text":"Love love love the keg. Great bar, great food, excellent location, and flawless service always, no matter the size of the group."}
{"text":"Great steaks with good prices. My favorite part is that both Keg locations cook their steaks just how I want them and they rarely mess it up if ever.  Including prime rib which everywhere else always messes up for me.   Interesting martinis but they're average 10 dollars for 2 ounces. All their appetizers are good as well I love their scallops and French onion soup. The twice baked potato side is really really good, I wish that was a dinner on its own haha."}
{"text":"My medium Chicago style Rib Steak   My medium Chicago style Rib Steak.  My medium Chicago style Rib Steak My medium Chicago style Rib Steak Can't say that enough haha. Always orgasmic! And excellent customer service! they are awesome. My favorite steak place."}
{"text":"Went to The Keg and what I am gonna write will seem a little strange, yes their steak was ok, it was a little cold actually.  BUT, BUT, BUT,  their Mac & Cheese! It came to me all golden brown, crispy on the top, gooey in the middle. The truffle oil was a nice touch, making it all the better. I loved it and so did the hubby.  It was so good I didn't want to share! So, instead of the steak, what I am looking forward too is the 6$ side order of mac & cheese. Try it out, and tell me what you think!"}
{"text":"We heard \"you have to go here\" and we heard \"don't go it's a chain\" but we are so glad we went! Great lounge vibe with good food and drink for the prices. Most other places for this price in Montreal didn't feel very upscale (we event stayed at the W). The keg was a good value. Our waitress was amazing and made our birthday celebration very special. Definitely recommend for visitors even though it is a chain."}
{"text":"Love the Keg!! Only chain that doesn't feel like it.  Barely ever have a bad thing to say about the Keg. The customer service is amazing. Any issue you have they will compt or give at a discount. \"The customer is always right\" seems to be the motto here for sure.  The PVM one is a cool urban vibe with great atmosphere, huge patio, and awesome bars. I prefer the Old Port location a bit better, but love he PVM location. I like to go to both and switch it up!    Steaks are always cooked great. I order mostly the Rib steak Chicago style Blue rare. Always Cooked perfect.  The apps are amazing. Bacon wrapped scallops, or calamari is amazing. Twice baked potato is great.  And ceaser salad are all my favorties.  If you've been before, or never been. You'll go and surely realise this is the top contender and best steak house restaurant that is a chain, that doesn't feel like it. Different locations with different decore help achieve this. Every dollar spent feels worth it. Bills csn get pricey.  But i never leave feeling ripped off.  Good job Keg. Never disappointed! !"}
{"text":"After having had dinner at another Keg steakhouse in Niagara falls ( Canada ) we knew we could expect a great dinner . We ordered 2 appetizers,  the tuna tacos ( 4 ) and the baked brie , both were excellent and we topped it off with a mini dessert which was a Creme brulee , also excellent. We also were very impressed with the atmosphere which was very elegant and charming . Most impressive was our waiter , Benoit , was quite possibly the best wait person we have ever had , hats off to him !  We absolutely love going to the Keg steakhouses and we will highly recommended them ."}
{"text":"Limited kids menu. We got the kids sirloin for our 8 year old and it was more than enough food. We ended up taking half of it home. Child's plates come with their own appetizer; celery, carrots with a little dipping sauce of house made ranch.   I got mushrooms Neptune and it was delicious and filling.   We split the tuna tartar and it was FANTASTIC. And a large portion.    My husband got the fried chicken listed under \"casual Plates\" and really enjoyed it.   Only disappointment was the wine menu. All the wine was overpriced for the brands. Not a great selection.   Will definitely be back. The table next to us got the nachos and they looked awesome. The service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"A definite must if you're visiting Montreal and looking for good food, decently priced, and non touristic. Dress nicely. The only bad thing we're the hostesses but we told the very kind and professional bartender what had happened, he let the manager know and it was all taken care of."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Keg for many years for professional and personal purposes. I have only been disappointed a few times because they ran out of certain cuts or it happened to be a busy night and did not offer their usual high-service experience.   But overall, I have to say that I had great times and enjoyed the food very much. I absolutely love their Prime Ribs and always go for it. I recommend this steakhouse for meat lovers who wants to eat an amazing steak and relax with a great/luxurious professional service.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"How come when you are travelling for work you always crave a steak dinner?  I was by myself so I figured I worked hard and I deserve a nice steak dinner so I went to this Keg.  It was packed because of Cinq a Sept but I managed to snag a table at the bar.  The servers were great and I had a splendid rib steak filled with delicious grilled veggies.  I was in and out in no time.  I was happy and sated and that's what Keg is all about.  Good food, consistent service and great vibe."}
{"text":"Hate to update this negatively, but we visited this location again on Friday and it was not very impressive.  First off, everything took forever. Drinks, ordering, the order and the check. Time seemed to stand still and we spent well over 1.5 hours total which is way too long for lunch. The building behind it (and maybe connected, not sure) is under construction. The table was shaking quite a bit which I didn't enjoy and there was a lot of noise. I remarked at the time that it felt like sitting on a bus.  We ordered drinks. I have to say that I had two white sangrias and they were awesome. Best part of the experience. For a restaurant named the Keg, they don't have a large beer selection. My dining partner got two Heinekens and no complaints from him on that aspect. I decided to order the shrimp and lobster salad. I don't know how they can really call it shrimp and lobster. When it finally arrived, it had 3 tiny shrimps and two chunks of lobster on a bed of lettuce with beans (not sure why), pine nuts (best part), huge mushrooms, slices of avocado and some tomatoes. It was supposed to have a mango dressing but I couldn't taste anything. It was very bland to be honest. I don't know how they could claim it was shrimp and lobster with that tiny amount. I actually ended up trading and eating my partner's salad as his was very similar but whatever dressing was on it was way more flavorful. He had the salmon sandwich. I had some of that and it was pretty tasty. For the time spent and meh food, I really wish I had gone to a new restaurant instead of returning to the Keg on my short trip to Montreal. I had wanted to order the baseball steak again but that wasn't even on the menu for lunch. Pity as I likely won't return now."}
{"text":"Great food overall, had to wait about 30 minutes on a Friday night, steaks were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their prime rib. It was perfect!! Every bite was delicious. I've been to the one in Toronto and this one is just as good! :) Try their pineapple splash you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service is great. Friendly, attentive and fast.   For summer lobster special, I would give 3.5 stars but overall, I think this place has solid menu for steak, big portion size food and nice mixture of formal/informal ambiance.  You will feel comfortable having a business dinner at a quite area (corner side), or casual happy hour at the bar area or a group/family dinner at the main area.  Lobster taco and gratin come with only a few small pieces of lobster.. so I'm not sure if these are worth the price.  Warm complimentary ciabatta-like bread was good.  PS: Most popular cocktail is Ceasar (basically blood mary with a bit of spicy kick)."}
{"text":"Had the strip steak medium rare with the Chicago Char. The steak was delicious. just wish they'd plate the steak on its own. The boasted tomatoes are not needed, they just release their juices creating a puddle the steak sits in. the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the lobster tails were delicious.  My advice, lose the tomatoes, just makes the dish sloppy and plate the steak and sides separately."}
{"text":"Time for an update of my go-to quintessential Canadian steakhouse meal.  It never fails to impress... me or my dining guests.  The menu is extensive and the steaks are to die for.  This time I had the prime rib.  The smaller portion was good for me - served with a twice-baked potato - it was enough for an evening dinner.  They also serve the most delicious \"au jus\" and very spicy horseradish accompaniments.  The service is impeccable and I am grateful that they work in teams.  I can't say enough good things about The Keg and specifically this location.  I brought guests from Mexico here this time and they loved it!  It is a bit pricey, but not by US standards.  Even if I wasn't on an expense-account, with customers, I would still want to come here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food was great.  It was a nice casual restaurant with an excellent wine and food menu.  The service was great.  The food well prepared.  The best ending was they offered mini desserts.  Just the right size after a filling meal.  A must got to."}
{"text":"Wait, what? I though we LEFT Chicago! Not a bad thing, mind you. This place was great!  We didn't have steak, but the lobster tacos and cream of mushroom soup we DID have were both absolutely delicious. What stands out here also are the cocktails. Perfectly made, icy and delicious - and some very imaginative combinations. A peach Whiskey sour? Yes, I will have another, thank you very much!  Sort of your typical steakhouse vibe. Hockey on the giant TVs, a swank atmosphere and adorable staff, dressed in chic black dresses. Great place to hang at the bar for a while and catch up on the hockey we didn't know we missed."}
{"text":"The decor was standard upper class steak house. Thr servers and hostess was very nice ans friendly. The steak was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked and the price you can't argue with. Overall great experience and great food"}
{"text":"Nunca pudimos comer, la mesera no se dignó en atendernos Así que mejor nos fuimos, le reclamó a la gerente y me dice que ella no se había dado cuenta, Pues con razón si ella no se preocupa por sus clientes mucho menos sus meseros. Pero en fin a mí no me fue bien, Asi que no lo recomiendo."}
{"text":"This is our 'go to' spot for a great meal. Service is attentive without being too fawning, food is great, drinks are good - what more could you want?  Our table had prime rib, cauliflower 'steak', jumbo shrimp and Ahi tuna. It was all cooked to perfection and flavourful.   For meat and seafood downtown - it's your best choice."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of the keg you really get a quality meal for what you pay for !!! It's a chain but they still do serve excellent steak and I find the lunch menu is pretty diverse, delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"It's not GIbson's in Chicago, but it's a great choice for satisfying the yen for a broiled slab of beef. Check out the pretentious menu descriptions for Coors Light for a laugh."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try if you like steak. I recommend the Rib steak, medium rare with the twice baked potato. It's basically a stuffed baked potato that has chives bacon and sour cream mashed into it. The best part of the steak was the seasoning. Even if you are a purist I think you should give this one a try! It works! Only thing I think they can improve on is dessert. All the choices seemed kind of standard, like there was nothing I felt like I had to have Or couldn't get elsewhere. For all I know it could have just been a third party delivery service. It did taste like one.  The service was great too. They had an hr long wait for 5 people, when we got there so we just went to the bar to have a few drinks and one of the managers said he would get us a table right away. We were seated before we even finished the drink.  Over all go there for the steak and drinks, skip the dessert. There are many places around you can just walk to, especially if you're on a date it will be a nice touch."}
{"text":"One of the great lies of Canadian society is that all Kegs are good. I mistakenly fall into a sort of self-induced sleepwalking state of hunger for steak every so often, and forgetting how bad the Keg really is, I give this location a try every 12-15 months.   While I cannot isolate what sodium-based preservative is being used in the kitchen as a flavour enhancer or preservative, I am guessing it is STPP, sodium tripolyphosphate.  The level of sodium in the food here is beyond mere seasoning, and significantly stronger than MSG.  I ordered the blue cheese filet with a side of king crab legs.  The meat arrived with what appeared to be a slice of boiled bacon wrapped around it. The meat itself was mushy, not tender, just mushy, as if the protein had been artificially broken down.  The sodium in the meat scalds and numbs the mouth by the second bite.    The crab legs smelled of ammonia.  I was massively dehydrated for 10-12 hours after eating what little I could.  I did not have a bad experience at the Keg in T.O. or Vancouver, so this must be a problem with this location.   If you do go here, please inform the wait staff that you will send the steak back to the kitchen if it is over salted. They may have another recommendation."}
{"text":"I am from New York City, a city that prides itself with having some of the best steak options on the planet. I have the \"Meathead\" Yelp Badge for checking into so many steakhouses. Yet, I am giving this place five stars. And this steakhouse is in Montreal. Allow me to explain why:  Food: it is extremely difficult to walk away dissatisfied with the food here, especially if you're from New York City. For $90, the two of us had steaks and one of us even had a perfectly cooked lobster tail. The restaurant may have gotten lots of feedback about flavor, because the steaks that came were perfectly marinated in my opinion, and the flavor was a source of great bliss. We did not have room for dessert, despite our mind wanting something sweet, our bodies simply said no. The portions here were quite large for a steakhouse in this French-speaking town.  Service: I thought the French did not really care about service, but this place really wasn't bad. Sure, servers appeared colder than what I'm used to, but this is Montreal, it's cold around here. =).  Decor: the place is a bit too dimly lit for my tastes. I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall and quite wide, but was bumped into by a server who didn't see me, likely because I was wearing dark clothing.   I really hope to be back. What a treat."}
{"text":"My first Keg visit was the one at PVM, a long time ago. Since then I've been to several other Kegs, but PVM remains my favorite one.  Even the best steak houses I've been to don't always cook your stake perfectly, but these guys usually get it right. I usually order the filet mignon, butterflied, medium rare. Fortunately, it usually comes to my plate just the way I like it. Perfectly cooked, butter knife tender, and very flavorful.  The prices are reasonable, decor is warm steakhouse, and service and servers are definitely above average for Montreal.  I'm generally not a fan of restaurant chains, but this particular Keg is one of my go-to steakhouses."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. Beats the crap out of the old port one (which looks like a cheap diner). Don't mess around, just get the 10oz filet mignon, applewood smoked bacon, skip the blue cheese (they don't do it right). Price is what you would expect. Good experiences, gone a few times and will go back. Can't say the same for the one in the old port though. 5 stars for excellent value to $ spent."}
{"text":"I got the 8oz sirloin with the veggies.  I really liked my steak.  I usually get the filet mignon but it seemed like they had a bigger selection of sirloins.   So, I tried something different for once.  I was happy with my dish.  It came with wild mushrooms which was also a nice surprise bc I LOVE mushrooms!  We went with another couple for a bday dinner.  The bigger steaks can tend to be a bit more rare if you order medium rare so I suggest to order medium to save a trip back to the grill.  They have great shooter mix and specialty drinks.  This is a trendy classy decor with a lot of young professionals (25+)  It's packed on the weekends.  So there is a wait up to 30+ min unless you sit at the bar or catch a table around the bar instead of dining else where.  It's just as similar as dining table but quicker service.  Great place to bring friends or date."}
{"text":"Amazing steak, tuna tar tar, sides and service.  Perfect place for dinner before leaving on the nearby train."}
{"text":"I am already a fan of The Keg but was additionally surprised by their venue on of René-Lévesque and Mansfield in central Montréal.  First, it has a sophisticated urban vibe - both the location and the restaurant itself.  Secondly the food - in my mind always good - seemed even better.  I had the \"Dungeness Manhattan\" which is their Manhattan Cut (basically a medallion) topped with crab meat, shrimp, and scallops.  Wow.  Seriously, wow.  To top it off the service was great - friendly, helpful, prompt, and just enough.  Be sure to go if you're in Montréal.  Oh yeah, whoever is in charge of hiring the hostesses and waitresses there is doing a great job.  Let me say that again for any men reading this who might not have picked up on it the first time: whoever is in charge of hiring the hostesses and waitresses there is doing a great job.  I'm just sayin'..."}
{"text":"The chicken was by the far the best I've ever had. The wait staff was very nice and incredibly in tune with what we wanted. I def recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Based on the steak alone this restaurant would definitely get a 4 or 5.  However when dinning out the experience can be greatly enhanced or hurt by everything else tangible and intangible that surrounds your main course.   So starting the appetizers my traveling companion and I shared a bacon covered scallops and shrimp cocktail.  Both were pretty good although I found the cocktail sauce with the shrimp was a little bit sour and no enough heat Vs others I've had and I thought the scallops were a little dry.  I had the melon mojito and it was ok, very refreshing but I could have sworn there was no alcohol in it but the server assured me there was.  I asked for another glass of wine when my steak arrived but it never came.  Ok now that the \"bad\" is out of the way the steak is the true star of the show.  I had the peppercorn ny strip cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I had a side of asparagus and ofourse wished I had some wine but as mentioned before it never came.  The service overall was a bit lacking.  I ran out of water a few times and did I mention my wine never came?  So final verdict,  steak was amazing but needs improvement on the drinks, apps, and service."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  We ate outside on a gorgeous day.  The appetizers we had were the bacon wrapped scallops, crab cakes, and baked garlic shrimp.  They were all to die for.  For our main courses, we had the rib steak with crab legs, the prime rib with crab legs, and the filet Oscar.  The steaks were all just the way steaks should be.  Caramelized on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The whole experience was wonderful from the service to the food to the price.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One word, EXCELLENT!  We were here on vacation and the 6 of us went for dinner and all of us had a fantastic meal.  From the bread to entrees, it was all top notch.  Everyone had a great meal and I would highly recommended this restaurant to ANYONE.  If you are in Montreal please be sure to attend this restaurant, the steaks were some of the best we have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I had promised my husband a steak before we left Montreal and this place was within walking distance to our hotel.  I was a bit dismayed to find out it was a chain (we have a strict no-chain-policy when we are dining out on vacation) but since we had never heard of 'The Keg' we decided to go for it.  And I'm so glad we did!  It was a pretty happening place so on a Thursday night we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes.  They had a very nice patio and we were lucky enough to snag a table while we waited.  The waitress came over with a drink menu but it was all in French.  My husband inquired about a menu in English but the waitress couldn't find one and said it didn't really matter, that alcohol translates the same way...lol.  Ordering a beer and a sangria for me wasn't too difficult so I guess she was correct!  The patio was loud but enjoyable nonetheless.  Soon enough our pager started buzzing and we were seated.  The atmosphere alone is worth one star.  Perfect lighting, soft music playing, and a corner booth that was pretty private.  My husband had been wanting a cup of French onion soup and was pleased to see it on the menu.  He went with that, the wedge salad and a steak.  I'm not a big fan of beef - I went with a tossed salad and the Teriyaki chicken.  After practically licking the bowl my husband said he could 'eat that soup every day of his life'.  I think it cured him of his French Soup craving!  His stake was very pink, tender and delicious, just the way he likes it.  My salad was a bit hard to eat - long thin strip of vegetables topped the lettuce.  While it looked nice, I would have preferred a normal tossed salad.  The chicken was very tender and juicy and the teriyaki sauce quite good.  Since we were there celebrating my birthday I received a dessert on the house (Billy Miner Pie) complete with a sparkler in it.    The reason for 4 and not 5 stars was the service.  There were a few missteps along the way - such as not receiving the lemon for my water I asked for until the very end of the meal - which was a bit odd.  Why bring it at all.  We were never sure who our waiter was as there were 3 different people working our section.  It was probably meant to be efficient but was just confusing imo.  For a bill well over $100 I would have expected the service to be better.  But will I go back - yes, I will.  Because when I got home I looked up the Keg and found out there's one in Windsor, just across the river!  :)"}
{"text":"Just curious, is Chicago style steak supposed to look like it's over cooked like that or it's my problem(I ordered medium rare)... I asked the server what it was before I ordered it. I'm pretty sure it's not like what he described as beautiful color. It taste bitter, over cooked and taste like s**t. (Excuse my language)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday. A lot of the reviews are correct. Had the Prime Rib and it was fantastic. She had the tuna tar tar and was talking about it all weekend. The food was great. The ambiance is nice; really big space. We walked in on Saturday night at 8:30PM without a reservation (as they don't take reservations), and we were seated immediately. I would highly recommend The Keg Steakhouse."}
{"text":"A taste of Paris in Montréal!  The steak frites were very flavorable and tasty.  The drinks were good too."}
{"text":"This olive is so good!!! Amazing service and I love all the food! Had a drink before dinner it was perfect. The warm crusty bread is so good. I had the wedge which was insanely good and delicious and the poke was a huge portion and lovely! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 9:30pm and at 9:45pm we're told that there were 4 tables eating desert and as soon as one was finished they would clean it for us. Not my idea of planning for customer satisfaction for a restaurant that will seat you only with a reservation. Were seated at 10:00pm. The manager did give us complementary appetizers to be fair. We were a party of 6. 2 ordered the prime rib - concensus=OK (not great) 4 ordered the fillet mignon - concensus = everyone agrees their steak was \"tough\".  No one received it to its correct ordered term. Wine list is overpriced and in summary this restaurant is not worth the price of its meal selections when compared to the quality of the food it is delivering.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Went there for a business dinner, everything was good. I heard they have another one in old Montreal, weather was too cold, so we decided to come to this new location, I like the layout/design of this place.  I ordered Fliet. it came out exactly what I want. everyone else's order looks good.  the drinks were great as well.   I would come back if I'm come back to Montreal again for sure"}
{"text":"Nice place to share a drink and meal with friends.  I went there for lunch with my buddy.  We didn't make a reservation but the wait wasn't too bad.  We both ordered a cocktail.  My friend got a marguerita which she said was very good.  I got a basil raspberry mix drink, which I find to be pretty darn good.  Very refreshing.  It's not a fancy place but the food and service are good.  With good food and good company, what more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Vraiment bon,très belle ambiance,beau bar,personnel très courtois et bon prix JADORE jy retourne!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelor party dinner. The food and service was outstanding. Our server, Bianca, was very attentive with a welcoming smile despite it being a full house. Reasonably priced, make sure to get the escargot, my steak was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!  i was surprise bec it is in a super touristic area, and normally restaurants there aren't this good! We had as an appetizer a tuna tartare, which was so fresh and good!  Then each of one got different stakes and were really good, and my dad got ribs, it was also super good! the deserts were awesome and they were really open to help us with my lil brothers that are super picky.  So definitely you shroud go there!"}
{"text":"What was I thinking?  I should have been suspicious when I saw all of there  advertisements in the guide books but it was so convenient  to our hotel.    It  was Thursday evening and the bar was packed with the after the after work crowd.  We checked in without a reservation and were told to come back in 30 minutes well, why complain, when we came back it took another 30 minutes to get seated.       The  strip  steak was small and thin and  lord, can these people disrespect a potato.  How can you mess up a baked potato? They must cook them in advance and  reheat them.   So, long wait, noisy room, weak drinks  [ I think that they asked me if I wanted tto \"Keg\" size my scotch and soda.  I guess that it is like biggie sizing your drink.  What they brought was scotch and water but hey ]      They get a one star  . Montreal has so much more to offer. See the reviews of  L'express Restaurant."}
{"text":"To begin, we only went here because we received a $100 gift card from a friend.   The restaurant's decor and ambiance is great. Very classy. The bathroom could have been cleaner (there was water all over the counter).  Our waiter (Patrick) was friendly and helpful. He was a little too helpful and present at the beginning and nowhere to be found towards the end. His presence could gave been more balanced, but it's not his fault-he's new.  I had the escargot-it was good, but I've had better. It definitely wasn't worth $11.  I had the top sirloin with Asiago rice. The steak was really good, but the rice was disgusting (probably not the best place to order rice). My other options of baked or mashed potatoes didn't seem like anything special. I usually finish my food, but this rice was unfinished by the end of the meal.   My wife wasn't too impressed by her salmon, but my son loved his ribs.   Overall, The Keg is okay if you've got the money to spend (or waste), but if they wish to continue charging what they charge, for their menu, they definitely need to step up their game."}
{"text":"I've tried several of the steaks on the menu and never left disappointed - top notch cuisine. The cocktails are a savory surprise as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic steakhouse with impeccable service. Had dinner here during a conference last year and was completely impressed by the quality of the food.   Ambiance is nice, though it can take you a while wandering through the maze-like layout to get to your table. Still, it's a nice place for a date or any kind of celebratory get-together.  Prime rib was perfectly cooked and seasoned, mashed potatoes were heavenly. Price is on the higher side, but worth it."}
{"text":"Service was very good! The steak was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Don't waste your $$ at a \"so called\" high end steak place like Gibby's when the meal here is better and costs half as much!"}
{"text":"Came here with co-workers this evening. We were seated right away by a friendly hostess and within 2 minutes of sitting our waiter was there asking for drink orders. That was the theme for the evening as service was very fast (a little too fast as our entrees came to the table while we were still eating our apps). I had the sea bass as my main course and it was beautifully cooked. The quinoa salad was ok but the asparagus was too pungent with garlic. My dinner companions seemed to  like their meals: prime rib and New York steak along with the sides. Dessert was a hit with huge servings of billy miner pie (this is a sharing size). The atmosphere was a plus. Cozy and comfortable with a reasonable level of noise that allowed for easy conversation."}
{"text":"Came in for my birthday dinner. I have a severe seafood and fish allergy..was assured that I would be ok. Staff was very nice. Dinner was amazing. Local.riesling wine was also good. Would highly recommend this restaurant.  Very attentive to my special needs.."}
{"text":"I chose to eat dinner at Keg Steakhouse about two months ago.  Even though I would consider myself to be a cultured individual, I do not have a very cultured palate.  I enjoy American cuisine for the most part, so when I was in the planning stages of my trip to Canada, I definitely searched for more \"Americanized\" restaurants.  Keg Steakhouse came up during my search for restaurants serving more \"Americanized\" food and since it was only a couple of blocks from my hotel I decided to give it a try my second night there.  Upon my arrival I noticed that the restaurant was VERY dark and busier than I had expected it to be at 8 PM.  I was told that it would be at least an hour before they could seat me but that I could eat at the bar if I didn't want to wait.  I don't drink and generally don't like the smells or the loud jarring chatter that I know to be expected from drinkers sitting at a bar, but I was very hungry and didn't want to sit around for an hour either, so I accepted their offer and was seated at the bar.    My waitress was very friendly and attentive. I asked if the \"mushrooms neptune\" (mushroom caps with crab and cream cheese served with fresh bread) were good and she said they were delicious so I ordered that as an appetizer.  The mushrooms neptune were ok, but not as good as I'd expected.  The cream cheesy crab filling and the fresh bread were good, but the mushrooms themselves were absolutely tasteless.  I had also ordered their iceberg wedge salad during my first few ravenous minutes at the restaurant because, like I said, I was starving and the description of it \"tomatoes, crispy smoked bacon, buttermilk ranch or Bleu cheese dressing\" made my mouth water.  The salad could've been great, but the bleu cheese dressing was tasteless so I was pretty disappointed in that as well.  For my main meal I ordered what I order at steakhouses in the states, a filet mignon with a stuffed baked potato.  I ordered everything at the same time so my eyes were bigger than my stomach when I decided to order SO MUCH FOOD but I told myself that I could take whatever I was unable to finish back to my hotel to eat later.  With that being said, I decided to order the larger 10 oz \"bacon wrapped\" filet mignon.  I also asked for a side of marinated mushrooms because I really enjoy them with my steaks at home.  The steak was disappointing.  I have never had bacon wrapped steak before, but at Keg it did nothing to enhance the flavor of my steak.  It came with barely cooked red and green peppers.  There were absolutely NO juices flowing from my steak, ZERO.  Just a slightly moist juiceless steak with an overwhelming smell of undercooked red and green peppers wrapped in fatty inedible bacon.  My mushrooms were not anything like the sauteed mushrooms I order at home, they were about as bland and blah as the mushrooms neptune mushrooms, no flavor whatsoever!   I ate a portion of my potato and some of my steak and asked my waitress if I could take the rest \"to go\" and if I could please have the check.  At home, every restaurant I've been to brings \"to go\" boxes or containers out to ME and has me put my food in them to take home, but my waitress took my food in the back to box it for me in the kitchen.  At the time I was pleased with the friendly service even if the food was disappointing so when I got the hefty check I gave her a generous tip.  The next afternoon when I heated up my food I realized that my waitress had tossed out my barely eaten stuffed baked potato and the barely eaten sauteed mushrooms that I had paid extra for as a side.  That annoyed me because I had been looking forward to the potato to accompany my bland steak.  Later that day I opened my laptop to search for places to go that evening and to figure out where I was going to eat dinner.  The Keg steakhouse menu was still open on my laptop from the day before.  It was at that time that I became really ticked off because I realized that the wedge salad and the sauteed mushrooms which I had paid EXTRA for came WITH my meal under the section \"Keg Classics\".  I had only looked at their \"Steak and Prime Rib\" page and didn't think to look further.  Had I turned the page I would've seen the section \"Keg Classics\" which listed the 10 oz filet bacon wrapped filet mignon with baked potato AND sauteed mushrooms AND wedge salad for $43. My waitress withheld this information from me and charged me $40 for my 10 oz bacon wrapped tasteless filet mignon with baked potato, an extra $5 for the tasteless bland sauteed mushrooms AND an additional $9 for the tasteless wedge salad.  Wow.  I can politely overlook a bland overpriced meal, but I consider what she did to be dishonest, which is why I feel the ONE STAR minimum that I have to give them with this review is extremely generous."}
{"text":"Server was knowledgeable and cool. Rib steak was incredible. Drinks were great. Outdoor/indoor patio was awesome.  Apps were excellent. Good crowd on a Friday night."}
{"text":"It was clean, looked fancy and had good service. There was no wait time when I went there which is normal for a weekday but there was also a decent crowd inside.   When it came to food, it could have been better though. I have definitely been to better steakhouses south of the border. Still the food was cooked to order, I ordered medium 10oz tenderloin and it was exactly medium cooked. However, lacked the taste I was looking for from a tenderloin. If they work on the sauce and the seasoning they can be a 5 star place."}
{"text":"The Keg Steakhouse was descent. I have definitely had better food at steakhouses before. I'm not giving them 4 stars because of their food but because they have good service and accommodate their customers. I would rate their food 3-3.5 stars.To me the food was just ok, nothing special. They are pretty quick and get you in and out. My husband and I decided to come here for my birthday dinner. We made reservations and were sat as soon as we sat down but because it was a busy night we only had 2 hours at our table. This was plenty of time.   We started our night with an appetizer which was the Baked Garlic Shrimp. It was good. Nothing to complain about here. Along with the appetizer we were served some bread. It was pretty good. Typical bread from a restaurant. Now it was time to order our entrees. I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Chicken and my husband ordered the Supreme Chicken. I didn't really get to enjoy my food like I wanted to. First I asked to have the slaw cabbage substituted for Brussel sprouts in which I was told I couldn't and had to order a side of Brussel sprouts. When my chicken was brought out it had a piece of hair laying on the top of it. I immediately called the waitress back over and told her.  She took the plate back and the manager came out and said that they were making me more chicken and he was sorry for what had happened. I was served my side of Brussel sprouts to munch on while waiting on my new chicken. Needless to say about 20-30 min later my new chicken came out. At this point I really wasn't as hungry. It also looked as if the chicken had been cooked fast as they were trying to get it out to me so it had places that were shiny and didn't looked fully cooked. I am very picky about the way my meat looks and is cooked as I have had food poising before and it lead to pancreatitis and 10 days in the hospital. I DO NOT play about my food temperatures. Also the chicken was supposed to be stuffed with asiago cheese and it wasn't. OOHH and when my dish came out it was served with the Brussels sprouts I initially asked to sub to in the first place but was told I couldn't. The chicken wasn't that good and lacked seasoning. The mashed potatoes were descent. Overall I just didn't get to enjoy my meal. My husband enjoyed his meal, but had the same thoughts as me. It wasn't bad but we have had better steakhouse food.   After dinner we ordered the brownie and ice cream and they put candles on it for my birthday. The brownie and ice cream was actually good and we shared and enjoyed it together.  Overall, the food at The Keg wasn't anything special BUT the customer service was good. The reason I gave them 4 stars was because when my meal was brought out with hair on it the manager came out to address the issue and told us my meal would be on the house. Also, they do not do anything special for birthdays or free desserts. However, if I remember correctly (this was 2 months ago.. Yes I'm late posting this review, I know. I'm also preggo and can't remember anything, lol) my dessert was also on the house because they messed up my meal. I think we only had to pay for my husbands meal and the wine he had. Although the food wasn't anything to brag about I must give credit where it is due and they do have great customer service when mistakes are made."}
{"text":"Terrific meal and atmosphere in Montreal.  I tried the scallops wrapped in bacon as an appetizer. And it didn't disappoint!  They added a variation of a cocktail sauce for dipping that accented the saltiness of the bacon beautifully.  For an entree, I tried the ribs at the suggestion of my waitress/bartender.  I a usually hesitant to order ribs anywhere but in a true BBQ joint, fearing a tasteless, tough or chewy meal.  These ribs were spectacular, though.  Unlike rib joints in the U.S., these were served dry rubbed with a very tasty pepper and with an amazing BBQ sauce on the side.  The sauce was peppery, with a heavy hand of Worcestershire sauce.    The flavor was amazing, and the texture perfect.  There was a decent amount of chew, yet it fell off the bone cleanly.  If I didn't live in NJ, I would be frequenting this place more often! The wait staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, too.  Even the bread was great."}
{"text":"Ideal for lunch with colleagues or with a client \"The Keg\" is ideally situated at its downtown PVM location. The place is pure class with an incredible waiter service who are always attention and helpful. Service is pretty fast and on a special note... the waiting staff is ridiculously attractive. Not too sure about the guys but the women are smoking hot and dressed to impress. I'm totally a leg man so trust me... I did appreciate the view(s)!  Anyways about the food, yeah?   I went with their 8 oz sirloin steak and side Caesar salad. I found the steak decent but was more rare than medium rare. Not sure if it was cooked evenly but didn't feel like it. The myoglobin practically oozed from my steak so I expect the steak went from the fridge to the grill then once done was immediately transferred to the plate. I recommend letting meat rest at room temperature and to let it rest again on a wire rack once grilled rather than a plate to prevent one side steaming.  Ultimately, I found the sirloin disappointing and it was nowhere close to how good I can make it at home. I've had far better items off their menu in prior experiences so I wouldn't have it again. The Caesar salad was decent but once again, had better. The dressing was somewhat bland. Where's the innovation? Make your dressing dressed to impress...like your lovely staff.   ^.^  For a franchise The Keg is better than what you'd expect but in more popular locations the experience can definitely differ.  Price-tag is decent for a steakhouse. Which is surprising since the decor is gorgeous and the rent in such a location is probably ridiculously high.  Everything being said, this was a positive experience but will try differently on consequent experience, if any."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend when we visited Montreal and it was awesome. Food was so delicious and service was great. Seriously no complaints. We got the garlic cheese bread and Caesar salad as a starter and I then got the steak and Cajun shrimp with the garlic mashed potatoes (seriously amazing) and my boyfriend got the 10oz filet with the same side. Everything was seriously delicious and the portions were great. Prices were normal for a steakhouse. Great location, great service, and great good. Will 100% come again!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere - warm, inviting and laidback while still retaining a sense of sophistication as a steakhouse.  It may be a chain, which I usually detest (and is probably the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), but the Keg is simply fantastic.  The filet mignon was perfectly prepared - it had the correct balance of cooked salt, pepper and spices to give it a savory full finish.  My steak was cooked appropriately to my order and so was my dining companions, an unusual occurrence at such a big restaurant.  The sides were matched in quality.  The caesar salad was appropriately dressed without the heaviness or drenching effect sometimes experienced at steakhouses. Dessert was also fantastic with an ice cream-based chocolate cake. Service excelled with friendliness abounding.  All around - the place should probably get 5 stars, but I will deduct a star for unnecessarily loud pop music being piped throughout the place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Keg (oddly enough, the Ville-Marie one more so than the old-port) - But they're both 5 stars, nonetheless.   Their filet mignon is to die for. You ask for medium rare and you ALWAYS get what you ask for, nothing less. There's also the baseball top, which is quite intimidating when it arrives at your table, however it was so good, I couldn't stop eating it... Even after I was full.   Get the Keg size Bloody Caesar... It never fails. They put some sort of long spicy bean in it, which adds its own personal uniqueness to a classic.   Staff is extremely friendly and professional. A plus."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and the food was delicious. I ordered twin lobster tails, asparagus and a twice baked potato. All of it was great!"}
{"text":"If you have seen their ads, the waiter bringing in the food slowly, the steak is juicy and cooked to perfection- this place is just like that. No exaggeration.  New York strip is my favorite, go for the salad instead of the fries (it justifies the desserts and the wine). Their French onion soup would transport you to heaven, guaranteed. Steaks are tender, desserts are gigantic (yay!). Did I mention their bread is unreal?   This place is ideal for a good business lunch and a cost family dinner. I wouldn't recommend this place for a date though Highly recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"The Keg is of course a chain, with a great formula for serving a decent steak dinner. The PVM outlet is no exception, but actually had the best service of any Keg I've ever been to. Really friendly staff all around, everything was well-paced. This suited us as we were limited in options to get something before catching a train, which turned out to be late for one thing, and have dinner service for another. At least while other passengers were eating Pizza Pizza ordered in by Via Rail, we sat in the business lounge drinking wine from coffee cups after a good meal!"}
{"text":"The service was very good so was appetizers and main but for me the dessert failed so I had to take some points off.  Otherwise I would have given this 4 stars.  If I did have time I would go back again, for the steak.  I had Escargots for appetizers - loved it.  Very aromatic with the herbs and I particularly liked the combination of the champignons with the escargots themselves.  For main I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with side of vegetables which included sauteed mushrooms, grilled red and yellow pepper and squash.  Steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare and I dare say it really was most flavorful steak I have tasted in a long time.  The slight charred flavor of the accompaniments and sweetness of the pepper played off the steak wonderfully.  I should have stopped there.  Being a dessert person, I tried the trio of minis - which was a butter tart with vanilla ice-cream, fudge brownie with caramel, hot fudge whipped cream and ice-cream and finally a passion fruit crème brulée.  Value for money, that seems like a great deal for $8.  However the best thing on the plate for me were the ice-cream.  The Butter Tarte wasn't bad and tasted a little like a pecan pie without pecan.  Brulee was fine but nothing to rave about.  Brownie was the biggest failure.  Probably made earlier in the evening and by the time I ate (wasn't that late, only 9pm) it was like a piece of dried chocolate cake drowned in overly sweet fudge sauce."}
{"text":"I've been here soooo many times that giving it any less than 4 stars would be absurd.   I absolutely love this location, it's very chic and nice, but still fine to show up in jeans and a T-shirt. It's that kind of place where when you bring out-of-towners (or ur friends and family who've just not been here yet) and the immediate response upon entering is always: \"Oh, wow!\"   It's an extremely popular place regardless of what day of the week it is. Chances are you will be invited to sit at the bar (free for anyone to grab a seat) with your lil electronic red light line disk thingy until a table is free. So do expect to be having cocktails and appetizers before your meal (and if you happen to luckily get a table right away, well then, tant mieux)!  The food and drinks are pricey. But worth it. So extremely delicious, I've tried just about everything that's not seafood here and I recommend it all. In particular, I love the nachos with steak, i love their filet mignon, and i love their asparagus!   The only thing that always bums me out is I always get an intense cheese craving when I come here, but there aren't any cheese platters nor any plates really covered in cheese (except nachos, obviously, but that's not the kinda cheese i mean). The only cheese available for the steaks is blue cheese and I'm not a fan. I really, really wish they had goat cheeses and okas and goudas available too. They do have a baked brie, however, and that's what I usually get when the craving is intense.   The staff are very easy on the eyes and that's always pleasant too. They treat their regulars like friends, but still don't ignore the newbs. It can be a bit confusing as there is 2 entrances and 2 hostesses and no one actually stops you from walking right past them and wandering through the usually packed restaurant, but just approach a hostess and she'll take care of everything!   I highly recommend this place as a must experience, at least once, while in Mtl (I know they have them elsewhere like another in Mtl and in Ottawa, for example, but trust me they ain't got sh*t compared to this exact location)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great all American style steaks. Great place to bring the guys or a group of friends.  Don't expect a huge list of wine outside of American selections - definitely ask the waitress which one would be right for you because they did run out of a few bottles when I went.  I only gave this location 3 stars because the service wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"I loved it! The portions were pretty big and the food was great. The waiters were incredibly nice and served us quickly. One of my best experiences at a restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Try the Steak and Lobster tail combo! Highly recommend for a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"Over priced, overrated. I came here after hearing great reviews from my friends and all the foods were bland and not worth the price"}
{"text":"Great meal, we had a terrific waitress (funny, personable and knowledgeable) and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Steak was cooked perfectly, crunchy shrimp appetizer was amazing. Service was very friendly and fast. Great steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Vastly different experience than the Keg that is in Old Montreal.  Steak undercooked, potato overcooked. Not a good combination."}
{"text":"One of my favourite locations.  Love the decor and lounge aspect to this location. Service is great, as the staff are very helpful. I tend to use this location for business lunches and all those that I bring have great experiences there."}
{"text":"LOVED this steakhouse. The food and atmosphere were both excellent. I came on a Friday night and the restaurant was busy, as expected. We were told the wait was 30 minutes for a table for 2 in the main dining area, but the bar dining area was first come, first served. As luck would have it, a couple was getting up in the bar dining area just as we arrived, and the waiters quickly cleared their table for us. I ordered the white wine sangria and my friend ordered a peach cocktail. Both were sooooo delicious. For my meal, I ordered the Thai chicken, with a side of mashed potatoes. It was fantastic! I'm typically not a meat person, but this chicken was cooked perfectly! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After dining in a MUCH more expensive and upscale steak house in Montreal and having a horrible experience, we tried the \" KEG\" The food is terrific and  very well prepared. The service was very prompt. While in Montreal for 5 days, we ate at this location 2x. Both times were delicious. This is a place we will be going back to often!!!"}
{"text":"Afin de célébrer mon anniversaire, mon papa me propose donc de se faire un petit resto mais plus précisément un Steakhouse. Premier réflexe, je sors mon application Yelp et tombe sur le Keg, qui a une bonne moyenne vu le nombre d'avis donc direction le Keg. Une fois sur place, il y a les hôtesses qui nous accueillent et nous installe à notre table. Première impression, c'est élégant, classe mais par contre il fait vraiment très sombre, il faut un petit temps d'adaptation, mais on s'y fait.   La carte est diversifiée mais pas trop longue. J'opte pour le filet mignon et mon papa pour le steak New-York. Nos assiettes arrivent assez rapidement. Alors, la première bouchée fut divine, viande tendre et avec goût, tout ce que j'aime, accompagné de cette petite purée, mmmh délicieux ! Quant à mon père, son steak avait un peu plus de gras mais c'était bon également et le gras on sait que ca donne du goût !   Le service était correcte, sympathique mais sans plus.   Concernant le prix, avec les boissons et le service on s'en sort pour environs 40$ par personnes, donc rapport qualité-prix c'est justifié.  Si vous aussi, vous êtes dans le centre ville de Montréal et avez envie de vous faire un bon steak, n'hésitez plus et allez chez Keg, vous ne serez pas déçus."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Fairmont (across the street).  This restaurant exceeded my expectations going into it.  On a Saturday night, a group of 5 had no trouble getting a table around 7:30 (although it got busy quickly).  Service was excellent.  The wine menu was good.  Most importantly the food was outstanding, especially for the price.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and were very flavorful; the lobster tails were great (a nice touch with the candle heated butter); even the salads were very good."}
{"text":"Well we came here as a last meal before our Bachelor Party officially headed back home and it was a fitting meal. We came here pretty late Sunday night and they seemed to be accommodating as the kitchen was about to close in 30 minutes so we put in our orders as quickly as possible before they close. Obviously it was Sunday night towards midnight so the crowd definitely died down and basically just a few occupied tables plus some bar people.   The waitress was extremely easy on the eyes who was tall, overall great body and not butter-face. She was a bit more talkative than we expected but we let her get away with it since she was hot enough. Anyways before I deviate, we order some small appetizers and a few pints of Ricard's Red beer to go with our steak as I order the NY Striploin medium rare. The steak was pretty good and the side toppings of mushrooms and half a tomato was also pretty good. So overall, very good experience and definitely would visit again on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to this place the steak is perfectly done , however twice they made mistake but they offered to change the plate and they didn't charge me for my plate and the offered me a desert on the house ,( this is how most of the restaurant should be when they make a mistake -customer satisfaction first )anyway I love this place the staff are super nice , for a perfect night and relaxing calm environment I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's always delivered. There are better steakhouses, but this place is tops for \"bang for the buck\", this is not to say it's cheap, just great value. I've had great steaks, and last time, some great Ahi Tuna, it was a perfect meal. And the atmosphere is top notch, a comfortable hip feel."}
{"text":"Was in town for a bachelor party and had dinner at Keg and glad we did. 6 horny and hungry guys had plates of red meat, carby sides and glasses of booze served by a french canadian beaut that went by Christina if memory serves.  I personally had the kc/ny strip med rare as it was cooked perfectly along w/salad and sides. Great views outside / inside and really reminded me of a Houston's, ambiance wise in the states.  Shared really good food with even better friends as a precursor to the night.  Hospitality from a-z was Zed being top notch here as after our meal said server brings over her equally ridiculously hot sister and a round of honey jack shots which they also took part in.    Apparantly, it was a promotional thing so her boss gave the green light but also a heads up move before the check came...itz nice!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend, ordered calamari, top sirloin classic and filet and Cajun classic meals. The food itself was so-so,  the steaks were good but mine wasn't cooked the way I had asked. Our waitress messed up our order at least twice because she didn't write anything down but atleast the manager came over and tried to give us dessert for the trouble. We were in the restaurant for almost 2 hours which was not part of our plan, but it was because we saw our waitress maybe once every half hour. The restaurant atmosphere was nice but it wasn't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Our experience at The Keg was a wonderful way to end a long weekend in Montreal on a Sunday night. In addition to the great food, we really enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and the friendly staff. Our waiter, Nicholas, explained the menu beautifully allowing us to make the best choices. I had the escargot stuffed mushrooms, the 20 oz. bone-in rib steak (medium rare) and twice baked potato. Carol had the French onion soup, 14 oz. prime rib with baked potatoes. For dessert we shared a refreshing and delicious Billy Miner pie!"}
{"text":"Adoramos o lugar, ótimo atendimento garçonetes nos ajudaram a entender o cardápio!  Ambiente agradável porém um pouco escuro!  Comemos o prime rib com adicional de uma batata recheada muito boa recomendo (o prato dá tranquilamente para duas pessoas)! Mas a melhor parte disparada foi a sobremesa (uma torta coma base de oreo e café no recheio)! É caro, mas vale o preço !!!!"}
{"text":"The Keg is a very good restaurant. This restaurant have a very good steak. Summertime is the season for lobster. The Keg has an excellent wine menu so you can desgustar along with their plates. The service and excellent."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant very democratic ambiance and gathering food was extremely good and the service also keep it up you guys are on your way!!"}
{"text":"Fellas,  If you and your buddies want to start off a bachelor party with a steak dinner, this is your place.  One of the best steak experiences I've had.  Especially if you could snag a table in the bar/lounge/waiting area.  Although it was dark outside, the views were amazing.  ;-)"}
{"text":"In a recent trip to Montreal my wife and I got caught in a little shower and popped in here for a drink and to get out of the rain. We sat at the bar where we were greeted by a friendly bartender, who I regret not getting her name to thank her here, who filled our drink order. I ordered a Rusty Nail, a cocktail which I think saw it's hay day in the 1920s, and though she admitted not being overly familiar with it, mixed up a very enjoyable one just the same. My wife asked for a Bloody Mary and though the place was busy for a 2-3pm weekday she took the time to ask my wife if she wanted a Bloody Mary of a Bloody Caesar, explaining the difference. Since the Bloody Caesar uses Clamato and my wife has a shellfish allergy she went with the Bloody Mary.  The place has a dark interior, fire in the fireplace, very romantic in my opinion and would make an excellent spot for a special date. We'd already had lunch and it was too early for dinner but would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner and it was okay.  Our waitress was super nice and friendly, I believe her name was \"Mary...\" something. The problem was our food, it took at least 45mins - 1 hour for our food to come out. And they came out wrong, I asked my steak to be medium rare, it came out medium. My friend had a combo, steak w/ king crab legs, the crab leg never came out. We complained to the manager, at first he questioned us \"when did u first sit down? How long did it take u to order ?\" I believe he questioned us because he didn't believe it took an hour for our food to come out. In the end, he was very apologetic, and gave us a round for free shots and comped my friends meal.   The food was good (probably because I was starving), but the food time was bad. Coming out late and coming out wrong. For a first time experience too, it was no good."}
{"text":"The steaks are AMAZING (duh). I had the teriyaki sirloin and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. When people say size doesn't matter what they're really talking about are the steaks at the Keg. Although the portions are a bit smaller than other places, its surprisingly filling and did I mention delicious? I had the twice-baked potato on the side and I have to say it was bomb.  Decor is awesome and staff are extremely helpful, definitely a good place for date night."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Have the Prime Rib. You won't be disappointed.   We went on a Saturday. No reservations accepted. Got seated quickly. Ordered our meals and wine. My son ordered a steak medium and it came out Rare twice!!!!  They made good on it ('my son was very polite about it). The Keg comped meal + gave him dessert. Very classy.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Dine here on an almost Bi-weekly basis, great for a consistent meal that is not over-priced.    Service is quick and food is great, even when compared to a Moishe's (besides not paying $60 for a steak) or something similar.  Great spot if you're looking for a regular staple that serves a great steak, seafood, or chicken (not the most vegetarian friendly restaurant) without breaking the budget (or expense account)."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here with the family all of the food was great. We all got different cuts of beef and everyone was very pleased. While I was happy to see they had bourbon they butchered the old fashioned. Maybe I'm just a snob but an old fashioned should never have muddled fruit in it. It's an old simple drink of bitters sugar whiskey and an orange peel. But that was my fault for not reading the menu so the stars stay! Very friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! I've been to the one in Niagara Falls and was excited to celebrate my Sister-In-Law's dinner in Montreal, and I have to say, they did not disappoint ! The place is stunning and a true compliment to such delicious food! Even the women's bathrooms are beautiful ! All in all we had a yummy meal at a beautiful restaurant that upheld our expectations!!"}
{"text":"Ah The Keg. My first foray in the madness of steakhouse fanboyism. It's The Keg, was is there to say? Most Montrealers and Torontonians are familiar with it as each city has more than a few franchises. And there's the rub... franchises, meaning that everything is designed to please everyone as much as possible. Very dark and masculine decor, because let's face it, the steak obsessed are mostly men, though I know a few women who worship steak like I do. And since this is mostly a man's obsession, the service is all female and by female, I mean insanely hot women and by insanely hot women, I mean you'll forget your own name hot. Well at least in the lounge area. The dining area has more elegant women dressed in a more classical outfits. I like slutty women as much as the next guy but I always prefer elegance over sluttiness; a woman wearing a tailleur is sexier than a woman with a skirt so short it qualifies as a belt, but I digress.  Again this was the first Steakhouse experience I've had and back then it was a glorious experience in steak obsession. But since then I've travelled and tried Steakhouses all over North America so The Keg sort of lost its shine and on 3 occasions my bill remained unpaid for ruining my steak. But they deliver a better than decent steak with tasty side dishes. They often have specials with their steaks, such as a New-York strip topped with Boursain cream cheese and chipotle chutney, which was amazing.  All the mixed drinks come in Keg sizes as well as regular, getting you drunk fast and that bartender is often well qualified and delivers very good drinks such as Tom Collins, Long Islands, and the sort. The deserts are the boring usual suspects expected of chain restaurants but are delicious none the less.   It's a great place to enjoy affordable well prepared steaks with groups or office lunches and so forth but fails to be my go to steakhouse when I want to rock my palate with an awesome steak.  4 stars for what it is. If I were judging just the steak, I'd give it a 3-stars."}
{"text":"Service - 4/5 Food 3/5 Price - 3.5/5 Decor - Very nice, grand space, terrace was an option.  Not impressed with the prime rib (tasteless, must add salt and drown in au jus) and NY Strip. Wine list is very reasonable, so pick a California red (I know, I know when in Montreal)"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar area. The Tuna tartar was spectacular. The nachos were better than most of the nachos I've had in the US. The burger was good, but I expected something incredible. The best: the ambiance and the service."}
{"text":"Not enough amazing things can be said about this place but here goes!  The Service in this restaurant was absolutely perfect. The ambiance of the location is gorgeous, comfortable and is suitable for a group of friends or for a casual or romantic date.   The location takes reservations and was very helpful in helping us do so. Furthermore the hostess and service staff was on the top of their game, consistently!  Here's the most important part....the FOOD! We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start, including the escargot. I can say everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. One thing to note, the escargot is mixed with mushrooms so you will mostly taste the mushroom (if you haven't has escargot and want to try it for the first time, this might not be the best place but regardless, the APP is delicious!) The entree, ofcourse, was STEAK. I ordered the bone-in ribeye steak with a side of baked potatoe and bell peppers. Everything was cooked perfectly to order, was juicy and was delicious.   Here is the final kicker....if you often go to top steak houses, you will know that steak can be a bit pricey. Typically aged bone-in ribeye steaks can range from $55-$90. This place had an amazing price if approximately $50 CAD. That makes the steak and overall dinner extremely affordable!  If you are in Montreal, dedicated a dinner to this place. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Disappointing and overpriced. We wanted a nice steak dinner but didn't want something old fashioned so we chose this place based on other yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel. Our waitress was slow to serve us and seemed distracted when she finally did make it over to us. We ordered the escargot and although the snails were tender the sauce was almost a tomato sauce and way too heavy. The steaks were way undercooked. My husband's MR was blue and my Medium bacon wrapped filet was medium rare and the bacon was flabby. My husband ordered a twice baked potato as a side and it was both over cooked and cold when it came out. In a city with so many wonderful food options this is a place to skip, for sure! Way too expensive to be this mediocre."}
{"text":"Usually the service is way better and quicker. This time we waited 20 minutes to get menus on our table. The waitress seemed to be super busy. Put more staff during lunch hour.. food was great cannot complain!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow ! Mon amoureux et moi avons une superbe expérience! La nourriture est succulente, l'ambiance est superbe et les employés sont d'une grande gentillesse! Une expérience comme celle-ci n'a pas de prix. Selon moi, les prix pour ce qu'on a est très abordable!"}
{"text":"We tried a lot of different restaurants on a visit to Montreal and this was by far the best! The sirloin with blue cheese crust was to die for (and I'm not a bleu cheese fan). Great service, too! Large wine selection with a good variety."}
{"text":"Vous cherchez un endroit pas trop haut de gamme pour vous faire plaisir entre amis et boite de bons cocktails le keg est la place ou aller. Le Burger était très bon, le tartare l'est également, il y a des plats intéressants à partager et une belle ambiance avec des serveurs attentionnés."}
{"text":"We're visiting Montréal and chose The Keg due to how close it was to our hotel- across the street. The food was impeccable as were the drinks, and the service was amazing. Highly recommend if you're looking for fine dining!"}
{"text":"The Keg does a good job on steaks. It's loud near the bar area but nice by the booths near the perimeter. Our waiter had a bit of an attitude but the meal turned out ok. I had the filet with mushrooms and a salad."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki steak with mashed potatoes and their salad. It was fantastic and I have no complaints. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Great service but my friend's food was served cold from the meat to the vegetables so they brought it back and again food was cold only mash potatoes was hot. But staff was great."}
{"text":"This place is geared toward business people more than anything, I went there for lunch a meeting. I was pretty disappointed. I ordered onion soup and Lobster salad. Maybe it is my mistake for ordering the wrong things at a steakhouse restaurant but boy I was not happy with my food. For the price point, I would have still expected a decent meal. The soup was ok but the salad was bad. Too much lettuce that was not fresh, very little shrimp and lobster. I tried some of my friend Tartar, it was ok, not impressed either. I am not sure if the waitress is new but not the best service either. The sequence of appetizer and main dish wasn't coordinated. We never got offered another bottle of water and it took us a while to get her attention to get coffee. I understand the lunch rush is a bit stressful but if you are going to charge a high price you better deliver on it. The ambience of this restaurant is good, it is super clean and I like the design of it. It deserves two starts. I am willing to give it a second chance, I will order the right things next time."}
{"text":"One of the best Steakhouse Franchise! The quality of the meat is near what La Queue de Cheval. The place is a Lounge-Restaurant in a low-lighted ambiance with some ambiant/jazzy music. The staff is extremely qualified and perfectly bilingual. They know their menu and have a great way of showing it. I went there with friends after a long week of work, and got a Amaretto Sour before starting my entrée. Real Lime Juice and well balance ; most of the time, in restaurant they try to cheat to save money by serving some concentrated lime juice. Then ordered a bottle of wine. They have a large selection of wine and a full bar selection.  I took some Crab and goat cheese with some light nacho   Then my main course was a Baseball surloin cut - blue - with potatoes and Aspargus and mushroom. You build up your plate the way you want and chooses what you want.   approximatly 100$ per person if you drink (appero and Bottle of wine)  take an Entree and a Desert.  NB: Weird fact: the Bathroom was amazing; lot of cool modern-art design, heavy wood door, large mirror."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the fact I was alone but I didn't have a great experience at LE KEG! Service was slow to find a table even though I called for reservation. The food was average but I loved the iceberg salad. I don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"The best food I have ever had in my whole life in the food industry and in Canada. We came in here on a nice cool day in early September. We were greeted by the waitress and she was very nice and polite and she took us to our table. We got some bread to start off along with some butter, it was unbelievable, very soft inside and crunchy outside- the whipped butter was very good and light as well. We ordered, we had a nice gentlemen take our order, he was very polite and accepted every request we have given. We ordered a Caesar salad to start off with, and I ordered a 12oz Steak with fries and fresh veggies and my Grandparents order a prime rib appetizer to share. We got the salad and it was delightful with great dressing, tender lettuce, and nice garlic croutons type bread. It was very good. Then we got our food, As I took my first bite into my steak, I immediately realized that it was cooked to my request \"well done\" but yet had so much flavor and spices that it blew my mind. I gave my grandparents a bite and they loved it, even my grandmother who was not much of a red meat person, liked it. The fries were very good, as well as the fresh veggies. My grandparents tried the prime rib sliders and said it was very good. They had horse radish, fried onions and some sauce to go along with it. Very good. Overall, it was very good and the interior was nice as well, can't wait to go back soon! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Had lunch there and was not disappointed.  The food is great, the service is great and so is the atmosphere.  When you walk into a place that has a wait at the Bar, there's usually a good reason.  The reason is two fold.  First, the service.  The bartenders are really friendly, provide just enough interaction and have great recommendations.  If you're lucky, you'll get the opportunity to have either Jenna or Catherine take care of you at the bar.  Second, the food.  The food is top shelf and quick.  We were shocked at how fast the meals came out and how great it taste.  Next time you're in Montreal, find your way to Keg."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple: get the prime rib. Don't try anything else because it was absolutely amazing. I'm what you call a prime rib pro. I get it everywhere. All I can say is that I'm just blown away by how well seasoned and tender it was. Unfortunately the vegetables are wilted but who cares."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse! Food is always consistently good, fittingly priced, service is top notch - all in a beautiful, stylish, spacious decor downtown.  This place is always buzzing, extremely popular for business folks in the area. They do not take reservations on fridays or saturdays nor special event days. Waiting time for an average evening is usually 30 mins to an hour. You can either hang at the bar while you wait or I would suggest sitting outside, or right below in the Pace Ville Marie mall, there are some comfortable seats near the food court.  I usually get a filet mignon or other tender cut of meat along with baked potato, cesar salad. Meat is always cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. Their filet mignon truly feels like butter.  For appetizers, I''ve tried their garlic butter shrimps, with melted cheese on top - comes in a cute little plate, absolutely delicious.  They also serve a basket of warm bread for every table which I love. Bread is so soft and warm, butter melts right on it. There are other pricey steakhouses that do not serve bread so this is a detail that sets The Keg apart.  If you're in the mood for desert but don't know what to pick, they have a sampler of 3 different things, cake, mouse and creme brulee. All are very good.  The Keg is always a good choice for a date or special occasion, it's delicious food, great service, superb ambiance and location."}
{"text":"Great steak restaurant.  Had a dinner with my colleagues. Ordered NewYork steak with side salad.   Delicious."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great service.  Don't be fooled by the name, it's a nice restaurant!"}
{"text":"A keg like all the rest in short.  This one has a nice location, good service as always. Both times I have been here have been good. Food is always prime like any Keg I've been to. Definitely check this one out, it's clean and HUGE !! Haha"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ ribs and my husband had the top sirloin. Both were delicious and had good flavor. Our server was very nice and was attentive without being a pest. This restaurant was very nice and clean as well as being very well maintained during a busy Friday night. Tables were promptly cleaned as diners vacated them. If you are looking for a nice place to have a date night I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I think you get what you pay for in terms of steak in Montreal.  Not too bad. There is one in Old Montreal that i think is better though.."}
{"text":"The blue cheese petit filet was sooo good!  My daughter got the blackened sirloin which she loved.  The atmosphere was great, the waiter was great and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Busy even at lunch. Try the Tuna Tartare or the Mushroom Soup as a starter for your meal."}
{"text":"Très beau restaurant , propre chic et accueillant,le personnel est très serviable.  Lors de mon passage j'essayé un steak Manathan au pacanes , c'était excellent. (Ce n'est pas sur le menu, mais n'hésitez pas à le demander à votre serveur.)"}
{"text":"Hubby & I have been here 3 times.   First time - GREAT, awesome service (I still remember the waiter) and the meals & dessert was fantastic.  Second time - MEDIOCRE, either the waiter or the cook got my husband's meal wrong. They made him the steak dish with the blue cheese sauce on top. The waiter noticed, said something first, and brought the right meal to him... we had to wait of course. Round #2, the steak was cooked very rare and hubby specifically ordered medium-rare. He got only a couple accompanying vegetables (it was embarrassing), yet the first dish with the blue cheese had a huge portion of veggies. THEN, later on he discovered a fruit fly in his glass of wine.  At this point he felt obligated to say something b/c our experience was deteriorating.... and fast. We weren't able to eat together because of the dish error and the wine fly grossed him out. We asked for the Manager & thankfully she handled the situation well. She apologized and they paid for my hubby's meal and wine.   Third time - FAIL (but not for me), hubby's steak was not cooked to his full satisfaction. It was too rare. He said next time we're going to Gibby's. LOL! I always order the Chicken Oscar @ The Keg and I always like it."}
{"text":"I would like to begin this review by admitting that I solely dine at this establishment when I have friends or relatives visiting who enjoy a nice night out and some good food. My limitations (i.e. being vegan) obviously don't allow me to try about 95% of their menu, so definitely don't look to this review for food suggestions.  With that said, I love this restaurant. The ambiance and atmosphere are both awesome. The service always exceeds my expectations. It is very easy to tell that the servers are trained properly, as I have only experienced being served by the utmost respectful, and polite individuals. The Keg is also always a favourite when I have people in town visiting me. Only suggestion would be adding more veggie options to the menu. I totally understand that this is a steakhouse, but it would be nice to be able to expand my options past salad and veggies. Other than that, I 100% recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a great prime rib here and the ribeye steaks that others had looked great too.  the Keg sauce was also really good and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have to give The Keg 'props' for reaching out, for it's apparent that they truly care about their establishment, both it's service and reputation! They not only apologized for our previous experience, but when we arrived, unexpectedly (during the second to last Habs game), we were promptly seated. It was a bit chilly, and the manager personally ensured that not only was the gas lamp turned on and working properly, but also made several good suggestions for menu items. Our server handed us French menus and seemed a bit frazzled, but considering how busy it was, it could be expected and excused. The steaks were done quite well, though the kitchen staff put the 'seafood topper' on the wrong steak (not a problem, it was corrected immediately, before the plates were placed in front of us). The drinks were quite delicious, and I personally recommend their Old Fashioned! This is a four and half star review, and I do not doubt that I will be returning to this establishment in the very near future!"}
{"text":"Courteous helpful professional staff greet you at the door. Our server was wonderful knowledgeable and quick with the drinks and our dinners. The food was very good tasteful and plated well."}
{"text":"It'd been 20 years since we'd been to Le Keg.  Back then it was more of a Outback or Steak and Ale (for those who remember them) than a higher-end steak house.  I will say they aged well. Friday night, place was packed. Service was great - server was fluent in French and English. The food was great - steaks cooked perfectly.  The prime rib was fantastic.  Desserts great."}
{"text":"I went to The Keg for a work event we ordered some appetizers to start which were all delicious.. Baked garlic shrimp, tuna tartare, baked Brie, calamari, shrimp cocktail. I ordered a martini and my friend ordered a Cranberry mojito and there was lots of alcohol in them both. For the main I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Potatoes were creamy and delicious. Filet mignon was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Service was good considering we were 14 people it took two hours. I would come again."}
{"text":"Pure sophistication here.  Decor Vibe Waitresses  Hostesses Food  For starters, you are seated in these dark presidential chairs. Surrounded elegance; high ceilings and huge windows for lighting. It sets the standard for what you see on the menu. Their Filet Mignon is the best around, cooked exactly how I like it. Edging me to come back. I'm definitely stopping by the next time I'm in MTL. Not only is the food great but the service is even better. The waitresses are very attentive and prompt in serving you. Making sure we enjoyed the meal.   During the week you'll find a lot of business men and women inside during the day. It's expected especially since the restaurant is located in the financial district. On the weekends and in the evening it'll be a bit more of a mixed crowd."}
{"text":"Well. This was a funny experience. I stopped in for lunch while waiting for a train. It was not easy to find in the greater station building, but it also doesn't seem to be making an effort. It's all very dark. Maybe to provide a calm spot in a busy day. The outer part of the restaurant was bustling, but I was taken to a quiet table in a smaller section, a welcome relief while in transit. The service was on point and the burger was surprisingly good. I ordered medium rare and was reassured the medium was the way to go. In fact, it was just right! Good, knowledgeable service, even for a simple meal. Plus, I heard the entire romantic history of the woman at the next table, an unexpected diversion. Désolé, ma soeur."}
{"text":"Ok, so last night we came here after a very long day of working a trade show booth. We were starving and ordered 3 appetizers: Bacon wrapped scallops, calamari and mushroom Neptune. I thought the mushrooms were the best appetizer I've ever had on the planet! Tonight I'm back at 11:30 pm, after a great steak dinner, to test my first impression.  I'm already stuffed but these things are amazing! Obviously hunger has an impact but if you ever come here you won't go wrong with the mushrooms! And the staff Id wonderful to boot!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Keg several times, and am never disappointed. It's obvious why they are so well-known for their steaks; they cook them to perfection, and on the rare occasion they don't get it to your specifications, they gladly take it back and redo it.   I took my boyfriend for dinner as a treat, because I'm usually always on the \"receiving end\" when it comes to dinner out. This is the 21st century after all! I normally get the New York strip steak, medium rare, with a plain baked potato, but alas I was not in the mood for red meat on this particular night (a rarity, really). Also, I didn't want to break my calorie bank! I opted for the teriyaki chicken with pineapple salsa, accompanied by a plain baked potato and grilled veggies. I've had teriyaki chicken elsewhere and was a little hesitant because a lot of times grilled chicken breast come out dry in most restaurants. Knowing that The Keg normally does grilling quite masterfully, I went with it. I was really glad I trusted my gut; the chicken was delicious and juicy, the side sauce was the perfect balance of sweet and salty and the veggies were grilled perfectly. I was pleasantly delighted and definitely recommend this dish to someone looking for a steak alternative at The Keg!"}
{"text":"The worst place we ate at during our stay in Montréal for the JazzFest 2 weeks ago. The food was mediocre, basically on the same level as TGIFridays.  Actually TGIFridays may be 1 1/2 stars better. The ambiance is very romantic and that's the only reason for the 2 stars.  The service was the absolute worse.  The waiter had no customer service skills. The steak was okay, the appetizer was ok, but the ribs were disgusting. I would not recommend or go there again  This place is not worth the price. Save your money and appetite and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"4 étoiles pour le service et le décor mais la bouffe pas surprenante , j'ai gouté au steak, à la salade cesar, tacos au thon et le fromage brie, assez bon sans plus. On paye pour l'ambiance :)  Mon spot preferé: les toilettes lol impecables et aux allures de spa avec banquette pour attendre à l'interieur et miroir géant pour se checker au complet ;)"}
{"text":"My first time eating at this Keg. Similar experience to other Kegs. Very dark lighting. Washrooms were interesting though, they were upstairs, had to climb a flight of stairs to get to them. Parking was pretty convenient, had to park on the street, but it's Downtown and wasn't too far of a walk. I ordered the Baseball Top Sirloin. The reason why it's called a baseball is because it's very thick and shaped like a....baseball! So thick that they can only cook it to rare or medium rare, no well done! You start off with your choice of a salad, I opted for the Caesar Salad. I felt that they put wayyyy too much dressing on that salad and very little croutons, so the salad was too salty for my liking. The Keg dish comes with a side of veggies and sautéed mushrooms and a side to go with it, but since it's the Keg, you gotta order the twice baked potato. To top it off, I got a slice of their Billy Miner Pie for my birthday to go as my dessert."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a late New Year's Eve dinner. We tried making a reservation but weren't able to since we called last minute. They told us to just come and wait but didn't give us any information regarding the wait time. We got there and were told the wait would be 60-75minutes. We got a great table in an hour and it was worth the wait. We had drinks at the bar and they even came around with a tray of free appetizers while we were waiting. I got the New York strip steak that was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend got the filet and in her own words, \"it was soooooooo good\". We might have had 5 staff members waiting on us. Our water and wine glasses were always full. My girlfriend has allergies and someone other than our waitress even came over to put her at ease about the food preparation. Even though the restaurant was swamped we had great service. For a steakhouse, the price was below average. Our steaks came with a salad and a side that were included in the price of our steaks. We were even able to get a cheap bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed that we never found the address. Don't click on the directions because you will never find it. Maybe next time. Because we couldn't find them we went to another amazing restaurant called Zibo."}
{"text":"Service was great on a Saturday night.  A Canadiens game was on, so the bar area was crowded, though not very rowdy.    The steak was above average, however I don't know much of the variety in Montréal.    I do wish that they had a larger beer selection, though their focus, of course, is wine.  Otherwise, I would come back for a nice dinner."}
