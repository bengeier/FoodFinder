{"text":"Got some mixed feelings about Mylys. It was recommended to me by someone who seemed to know his Viet food very well.  We went on a Saturday mid-afternoon, just in time for the end of the lunch special. For 8.50$ I got 2 imperial rolls and a beef pho; for that price, I was like wow, this is a bargain.   So its a bargain deal, because: a) the imperial rolls come frozen from some grocery store (they are NOT homemade - see photo) and b) the pho portion was tiny.  The pho was good though, so at least that's that, but had I known what the lunch special really was, I would have just ordered the pho from the normal menu for $10.   Also, the server who took our order was pretty rude, condescending and did not seem to comprehend either the French nor the English language? Like I was about to ask him if maybe he spoke Spanish.... All I asked was what beef cut was served with the lunch special beef pho and all he kept repeating was that it was beef. Yes, thank you, I know how to read \"beef pho\" but I wanted to know which cut. Anyways. It ended up being raw beef slices (I prefer cooked flank).  On the plus side, this resto is BYOB.   However, I doubt I'll be back, as my experience at Pho Ong Rau close by was much better and friendlier too (at least the guy there speaks and understands both French and English)."}

Menu légèrement différent moins \"soupe vietnamienne\" mais la soupe Pho/Tonkinoise est toujours bonne. À la place des autres soupes, un choix assez sympa au niveau des plats sautés. Adapté à la demande du quartier sans doute plus friand de nouilles et de sautés que de soupe. Globalement tout reste bon à prix vraiment raisonnable. Les gérants sont très gentils et on est toujours bien reçu."}
{"text":"As some of my friends would tell you...I LOVE Vietnamese food.  And this does not matter, regardless of city or country I am visiting.  So on my recent trip to Montreal, I was thrilled to find at least a few in the area where I was staying at, so one night, after searching high and low for Pakistani food (which we finally gave up, considering how hungry we were and how we did not want to battle finding a parking spot at rush hour), we ended up at Mylys instead.  While waiting for a friend, I did take some time to read up on the place, which got an article written about how excellent their vietnamese food was.  Done.  Once all together, we walked in, and got seated right away, after waiting for the waiter to clean off a table that just departed.  When reviewing the menu, I found out that this was both a Thai and Vietnamese place.  Perfect...I love Thai food too.  So, one of my friends ordered the fried chicken, the other got the General Tao's Chicken, and I got the beef and mushrooms.  Now...being used to the spiciness of dishes, I expected a bit more spices.  Not to say that the food was bad...it was actually good.  I just like to have a bit more garlic and ginger in my asian foods.  Then again, being Asian does make me a bit more of a critique.  Should I go back next time, I would definitely have to try Canadian pho.  I guess that will have to wait until my next field trip back up north!"}
