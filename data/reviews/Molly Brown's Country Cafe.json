{"text":"We've eaten here quite a few times and always have had a nice experience. The food is good and reasonably priced. Breakfast is what we typically eat here, and we really enjoy the pancakes which is my litmus test for a cook."}
{"text":"Take the time to drive to How's road for breakfast.  Dirty interior, average food.  One is afraid to imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"I joined some family members for a meal here that was just average.  Although my Mom and Dad enjoyed their meals, I thought my omelet was just OK and same with the biscuit.  The meal wasn't bad; it just didn't compare with a similar meal I get at Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. The restaraunt itself left a bit  to be desired.  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great food avg prices, Love the Hobo Skillet for breakfast (left picture)"}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price.  I had no problems with cleanliness. 
Good for breakfast with several interesting southwestern options. 
Huevos Rancheros was great. The other breakfast was delivered wrong.  Wrong cheese on egg and egg was barely warm. 

The kitchen and waitstaff cannot keep up when the restaurant is full. 11 AM Sunday there was only a couple of tables empty. We (2) waited a little over an HOUR after being seated for breakfast. 
I would strongly encourage you to avoid this place if the restaurant is full. The Blue Door Bakery two blocks north at the corner of Btoad and State is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Portions are very large, prices are cheap, food is good quality I have eaten here 3 times many different items and have never left disappointed"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit here for breakfast. I had a garden omelet with breakfast potatoes, banana nut bread, and coffee.
 The omelet was amazing. The cook was very generous with vegetables and I can honestly say that this is the best that I have had in a long time. The potatoes were good. The banana nut bread was good, although it may have been slightly underdone. The coffee was good enough.
The prices are more than fare for what you get. The service was fast. I will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"Just awful. The entire plate of food was covered in salty gravy... And I ordered a sandwich. The service was trashy and restaurant needed a scrub. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it has been probably the worst place I've been to in the Falls."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and always enjoy a great meal. More of a traditional menu than the Ellet one which has more Mexican options. Great staff. We love Anita, Becky, and Marie."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the interiors are a bit confusing with the menu- not exactly cohesive.  It is country (hence the name) but still some Mexican items on the menu.  I prefer it for breakfast because their Muchacas are pretty good, especially for like $5!  I eat one & take the rest home for my boys for an after-school snack.

The food is good, the service is fast (without making you feel hurried) and the inside is very clean.  I tried to go here last Saturday for breakfast & there wasn't a parking spot in site!  I am glad to see this place doing so well!"}
{"text":"Three stars is pushing it a bit... think \"almost Perkins\"."}
{"text":"Country fried chicken was fresh and, french toast was  tasty.  Food is made from scratch and staff is friendly. Our server was the owner or chef's  daughter and was great. Very clean and we were all really surprised how fast food arrived to table. Food was hot and generous portions. Frequent coffee refills. Will definitely return.  (I reserve 5 star ratings for gourmet restaurants, that is the onlt reason for 4 stars.)"}
{"text":"My daughter loves the place.  I on the other hand am not too impressed.  The food is adequate and the service is OK.  

It is not the fanciest place and they need to wipe off the menus, but if you are not in the mood for Bob Evans this will do."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this restaurant - it is blaringly orange, with oddly placed country kitsch.  Yet, it is warm and welcoming.  The waitresses are prompt and polite, even cooing over my infant daughter.  I also overheard my waitress guiding an elderly couple through the menu, which was wonderful.  The food is decent - simple diner fare (we go there for breakfast so I haven't had any of their lunch menu).  They sometimes undercook their potatoes.  The only reason that the review isn't higher is that parking is very difficult.  Tight spots in an already small parking lot - the whole lot could use a good overhaul.  Other than that, we always have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"A fine family style restaurant akin to Bob Evans. Food is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable, with some excellent deals for seniors. The servers are super friendly and the seating is comfortable. Some delicious Mexican selections. Very good coffee."}
{"text":"My sister took me here on one of the rare weekend mornings that I was up in time for breakfast. We had just done a breast cancer walk, and I was starving.

This location has been a million different restaurants over the years, so i wasn't aware that a diner had opened there. And man, was I surprised by the food.

The menu has your usual breakfast foods available--pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, sausage--but the real gems are on the \"south of the border\" side of the menu. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and was presented with a gigantic burrito stuffed full of eggs, peppers, onions, cheese...the sauce on top of it was so good, i ended up asking for more. with a side of hash browns, there was no way I was going to finish the entire meal. I'm happy to say it was still just as good reheated the next day--this is important to me, because I rarely finish my meal.

My only complaint is that they need more of a wait staff, because we were left hanging more than a few times for small things, such as refills. Other than that, the place is great.

Keep in mind that they are only open from 6am-3pm. It's worth getting up a little early and chowing down!"}
