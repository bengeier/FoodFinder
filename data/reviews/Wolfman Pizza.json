{"text":"I'm laying down in pain with Wolfman pizza in my belly. My guess is it won't be there for long, if you know what I mean. You can find better pizza at a local middle school cafeteria, or Chinese buffet. You pay for the flat screen TV's. This place sucks."}
{"text":"I love Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger. 

There. I said it. I love the mustard sauce, the crust is killer, and it's one of the few times I actually, legitimately crave pizza. There's not a Wolfman's near my house, sadly, so I have to kinda drive across town to get it, which I happily do for that sauce. 

Wolfscetta as an app is okay - nothing to write home about, though the bread is tasty and it's well-flavoured, I always feel like it's a it heavier on the oil than necessary and a bit lighter on the tomato than I'd like. The balasmic that accompanies it, however, is pretty delish. 

The downside is that I went in this last weekend - lazy Sunday of running some minor errands with the hubby - and was really disappointed in the service. No, not 'cos they were stoned (which I doesn't actually bother me too much), but 'cos Jesus Crap, server - when I say \"I need a minute\" to check the menu, you don't have to TIME ME. 

Hovering tends also to be one of those qualities I don't relish in a server - I appreciate that you want to be attentive, but hanging out by the table is a little much, don't you think? I was cool, though - I know sometimes as a server when it's a dead restaurant, you just want to make sure you're giving the best service possible. I know we're the only table here, it's 7 hours til closing, and the skies just opened up with a monsoon - but I don't understand why, as my husband and I served up our first slices of pie, you thought that was a good time to ask if we'd want desert and choose to leave our check? Since it just began raining, did you think we might want to hang around and buy some more beer? Why didn't it occur to you that we might actually PAY YOU MORE MONEY when we can't see out of the window, due to the rain? 

Even more bizarre, I went to the ladies' room for a moment, and when I came out, the manager was hovering over our table, too, just behind my husband out of eyesight. Since - again - we were the ONLY TABLE IN THE PLACE, I couldn't help but ask if they needed to close up. I certainly didn't want to be the dick table that's keeping them there! But no - no shift change, no closing, so crush of people dying for our table. 

Just inept service that served to make me feel like I was unwelcome and they wanted me out of there as quickly as possible. 

Which kinda sucks, 'cos I can't get delivery to my house."}
{"text":"Wolfman's is my favorite pizza place in South Charlotte. I've ordered probably 10-15 times now and never been disappointed. Quality is consistently good and service is prompt- either in restaurant or for delivery.

I highly recommend the \"wolfbites\" app.  It's awesome.  And i hear the \"take and bake\" is a great option too for those that want to eat at home- going to try that soon."}
{"text":"Quick delivery and good food. Meatball Parm is delicious. Pizza is good compared to most here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent, but delivery is an epic failure.  Put an order online at 6:50 PM.  Estimated delivery was 7:50 PM, which is long to begin with considering that Wolfman is only 2 miles away from my address.  At 8:00 PM called and was told the order went out the door.  At 8:20 PM called and was told general manager was now delivering the pizza.  At 8:50 PM (2 hours after ordering) called again and found out the order was never pulled from online.  Bad process and bad employees who lied twice times.

Pizza maybe, technology no.  Don't order from Wolfman unless you are going to sit there or pick it up yourself.

Epic fail!"}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza spot! Very interesting pizzas. The cheeseburger cheeseburger is awesome. For dessert try the smores pizza!"}
{"text":"Looking up a recipe tonight for my daughter to make a mexican pizza at home and it reminds me of my days as a waitress at Wolfman in the 90's. I miss their pizza soooo much! My favorites were the New Mexico and the Mojo. Awesome owner and awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good, the atmosphere is what really makes the place though. I'm a basic gal so pepperoni and sausage is my go to, the service was great the pizza hot and fresh. I will be returning. Plus they deliver,  and the quality is much better than most chain places."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza I've had in Charlotte. I've tried several of their \"specialty pizzas\" and created my own - always been outstanding. Had only one bad experience when ordering 4 pizzas for delivery (pizza arrived cold) but they immediately gave us 4 coupons - good customer service. Waiter service can be slow, not sure why that is since the place is not very big."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had, and they have great lunch specials. They have everything from the basic pepperoni to baked potato pizza (my favorite). The two times I have dined it for lunch I wasn't impressed with the service."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Charlotte area. I've traveled a lot of different places and usually look for a good place to have pizza.

Outside of NYC and Chicago, this place is as good as it gets.

I've eaten here many times and every time it's been very good. They have a delicious and unique crust which makes the pizza memorable.

The ingredients are always very fresh. They have several kinds of pizza sauces as well.

They are reasonably priced.

The service has always been good, regardless of how busy there are. 

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Bad crust (tasteless), bad ingredients, CPK is a lot better. And they are super expensive. How are they still in business??"}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint located in strip shopping center. Fantastic( and very large) salad. Try the Caesar dressing. Really good. And now to the pizza - really tasty! Friendly service. Cute place as well. Will definitely return on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Problem: Pizza needs to eaten immediately after being removed from oven.

Problem: We have young children (2 under 2) and eating at restaurants is problematic.

Solution: Wolfman's Take and Bake.

We're pizza fans in this house, and we take it seriously. So we don't do takeout or delivery pizza. Doesn't matter how good the pizza starts out; by the time it reaches you it's not at peak. So we love Wolfman's for this reason. The Take and Bake option works beautifully and produces very good pizza. We always get the same thing - sausage with extra sauce. Recommended for folks who like good pizza."}
{"text":"I walked into Wolfman with a buy 1 get 1 free coupon.  The coupon said buy 1 pizza, get a second pizza of equal or lesser value for free.  I purchased 2 pizzas - (a) New York, New York for $17.99 and (b) Chickenstein for $19.99.  After presenting my coupon to my waitress, she disappeared for a few minutes and returned with my check. Only $7 had been taken off my tab.  My waitress told me my coupon only applied to purchases up to $7.00.  She went on to say... \"some buy 1 get 1 free coupons only applied to purchases up to $5.00\".  Looks like Wolfman is making up changes to the terms of their coupons at the time of purchase. After 15+ years as a Wolfman customer I will not go back."}
{"text":"The one star is for the fact that once this pizza place had the best pizza and delivery in our neighborhood for years. Recently, during the last couple of years, the quality and flavor have hit rock bottom.  The crust is always over cooked and the toppings taste as though they were thrown on top from a can. I have been keeping track of this because we love to order delivery pizza.  Each time we were more disappointed than the last!  The management has lost their pride and settled to produce a product that is obviously a disappointment to the neighborhood.  They once served a great product and I hope they do again. But, until then, we will not return. Wake up!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza place, fresh ingredients and house made sauces. We don't get over here nearly enough, but when we go, we're looking for something different on our pizza. Wolfman is always yummy, and served hot by a young but competent staff. Our 3 kids like it, we wish the kids' pizzas were bigger, but the drink is included so that is nice. I like the theme with werewolves all over the place and the newspaper menu. I always read their lead story, it's fun."}
{"text":"Wolfman was my go-to pizza place when I lived down the street from it in Charlotte.  Consistently good pizza.

Likes:  Their \"Pizza of the Month\" special is awesome.  As a poor grad student, I would order one of the $5 10\" pizzas, pair it with a salad made at home, and get two meals out of it.  Scoreeee.  They also have more unique flavor combinations than you usually see: black beans on a pizza?  I like pizza and I like black beans, so sounds good to me.  

Dislikes:  The pizzas can be pricey if you arent in the mood for the special.  I've also gone to pick up my to-gos a few times and the pizza wasnt ready when they told me it would be.   

Take it or leave it:  Take it.  Take advantage of the special.  Awesome.  I'm just sad that I didnt discover it  until a few months before I was moving away from Charlotte."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of pizzas way beyond the normal pepperoni and meat lovers options. The baked potato pizza is my favorite. My one complaint is that I ordered breadsticks once and they were really stale. Otherwise I've only had of experiences there."}
{"text":"Been a fan of the Wolfman for many years, usually frequenting the Cotswold location but the Myers Park restaurant is well run too.

Whatever you buy here, pizza, salads, specialty items, comes with TLC and attention to detail in making the customer happy.  I've never known it to be any other way and that doesn't happen by accident.  The food is delicious, portions generous, and the service exceptional.  

Maybe Jim should catch the red eye home and stay in his precious New York or New Jersey.  I'll pitch in for that ticket."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza for dinner and thought Wolfman was worth a shot.  I'm not really sure why this chain is called \"Wolfman\" but it makes me think of the movie Teen Wolf and Michael J. Fox.  Also, I'm not really sure what California style pizza is.  My guess is putting non-traditional ingredients on pizza since that seems to be what California Pizza Kitchen does.  Anyway, on to the review...

I had the Maui pizza, which had ham, pineapple, and gruyere/mozarella cheese.  It was on special so it was a great deal.  My server also recommend adding jalapeños, so I accepted the idea and enjoyed some satisfying pizza.  Atmosphere was nice: lots of TVs, moderate beer selection, copious amounts of wood paneling.  The service was good.  My pizza cravings were fulfilled."}
{"text":"Any Northerener who says this place is good is an idiot.  It is average pizza doused with olive oil.  It is so horrible.  Try Luigi's in South Charlotte.  Try Sabarro's downtown.  Wolfman sucks.  This place is like a southerner ordering barbaque in NYC .  SUUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS"}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Tues nite.  I cover my pizza with lots of meat.  Wolfman's is consistently good pizza!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. 1st time I ordered the Bella Lugosi (delivery) and split with a coworker, it was phenomenal!! I couldn't wait to eat it again. The next week, coworker and I each ordered our own, and it was not good. I give it a solid \"meh\". Coworker describes hers as \"gross\". I managed to get some of it down, but it was not an enjoyable dish, to the point where As soon as my hunger pains dissipated, I threw the rest in the trash.

Called as a courtesy to let them know it was subpar this time, and mgmt was very defensive and \"took a tone\" right off the bat. \"I watched the kitchen make those pizzas myself..\". 

I won't order there again."}
{"text":"I had my very first Wolfman Pizza experience last night.  I visited the one in the Cotswold shopping plaza.  It was a little smaller than I expected in there, but the few tables they had were enough to accommodate the number of people, making it look \"full.\"  There wasn't a lot of atmosphere and/or decor, but it was Kids (10 and under) Eat Free Tuesday and there was a \"Balloon Artist\" there making balloon creatures for kids of all ages (don't forget to tip!).  And the two TVs were playing \"Herbie, the Love Bug.\"

The menu was pretty extensive for a pizza place, and I had a hard time narrowing down my choices because even the creative sandwiches and salads sounded good.  We ended up splitting the 12\" Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza, which gave both of us 3 good-sized pieces each.  The pizza was topped with \"secret cheeseburger sauce, ground beef, bacon, roma tomatoes, mushrooms, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.\"  The chunks of bacon really added to the flavor, as did the secret cheeseburger sauce, whatever it was.  I was impressed."}
{"text":"Wolfman cooks all their meats. They get local vegies daily and get this. (They cut it with a knife instead of opening a corporate frozen bag of vegetables). Funky has been making every sauce and dressing from scratch for ever. Their specialty pizzas are outdated, but still outrageous. If you haven't tried it you won't understand. And if you think i work there think again. I was let go after 20 years and still can't be bitter. This is simply the best pizza you can eat in charlotte. #wolfmanstillwinning #itsyourdaykathy"}
{"text":"Good place to get a slice during lunch. I finally checked out this place today. It was pretty quiet and tame this afternoon. We had a great waitress. Pizza was great. Interior is pretty neat too. Definitely worth going to one day."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit.
Never a problem with decent service or a good pizza.
I dig making my own with bacon/ground beef.
I personally like their pizza sauce and style of crust... way better than a brix pizza spot any day.... toppings are cool wide array and variety!

Cool atmosphere!!!!! Have been going to this location for I've a decade and quality had not changed!"}
{"text":"They made me a combination barbecue chicken and buffalo chicken pizza that was outrageously good."}
{"text":"First time trying their online ordering system for a delivery. They got both the pizza and the salad wrong.  

When I say I don't like anchovies, I mean I don't like anchovies.  I didn't order anchovies.  I ordered artichokes.  I got anchovies.  

Called the manager who did not even offer a hint of an apology but gave a small refund.  Luckily there are plenty of other places to choose from."}
{"text":"Used the online delivery system to place on order. I have to say I am so happy for this option. I love having food delivered to my door, but hate having to actually speak to someone to make that happen (I blame this on living in NYC for so long and being able to order anything I wanted without having to speak to an actual person). 

I placed an order for a 10\" pepperoni pizza and a side of breadsticks. The estimated delivery time was approximately an hour  and it took about the exact amount of estimated time. 

The food arrived hot and smelling delicious. They do not skimp on the pepperoni! The whole pizza was covered and it was well done which made them crispy, which happens to be my favorite way to eat pepperoni pizza and it was delicious!! The breadsticks were also super tasty and I enjoyed them with dinner and then again for breakfast the next morning! 

I will definitely be ordering from here again as I consider it a much better option that the chain places that deliver to my house."}
{"text":"We ordered  a Chicken Thai pizza over the weekend for lunch and since we were hanging out in the pool, had it delivered. I am sad that they took my fav off the regular menu (Shrimp & Pesto) but I still love Wolfman's pizza. 

Their crust is not too thick and not too thin... I like the selection of chicken pizzas and the toppings are always fresh.  In addition to the Shrimp & Pesto and Chicken Thai, I also love the Spinach & Chicken, and the Mojo.  I also like to build my own pizza sometimes which is a nice change.  Sometimes I'll put together a greek style pizza with spinach, feta cheese, chicken, greek olives, and sun dried tomatoes. 

When I am in the mood for pasta instead of Pizza, the Chicken Florentine or Southwestern Fiesta are both good.  The salads are quite large and I really like the California and the Southwest chicken chopper"}
{"text":"Got a pizza to go recently, and it was amazing. Fresh ingredients and well-made - it looked as good as it tasted. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I used to work in the area, I would stop in here fairly frequently for lunch. They offer a good deal for lunch - a salad & a slice at a good price.  You can also get a lunch punch card if you are a frequent visitor.  

I really like the California salad and usually end up getting a plain cheese slice to go with it. I really prefer the Wolfman closer to home (better service and seemingly fresher ingredients), but this location is a-ok too."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Crust is crisp, toppings are fresh and good. Service is good, prices are reasonable. Very casual eatery, but a relaxing place for a quick pizza and a beer or two. Local drafts are featured. For a small place, a good selection of beer and wine. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"After seeing so many positive reviews on here my husband and I decided to try this place for lunch one day.

HUGE disappointment. The pizza tasted like we were eating leftovers and it was mediocre at best. We also tried the wings which tasted freezer burned and like they had been boiled and then tossed in sauce.

 I really wanted to like this place because the staff was so nice but was really disappointed in the quality of the food. The more I thought about it the more I felt like I got ripped off ($28 for leftover pizza and tasteless wings).

Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, most definitely one of our favorite places and most frequented since we had moved to the Cotswald area. Now that we are in Stonehaven, we are fortunate enough to be at the very edge of their delivery zone, even though we would still just go pick it up if we had to! The service when dining in, is just as phenomenal as the pizza! Love all the pizzas that we have tried, and ALWAYS go for the Wolfbites!"}
{"text":"Family wanted brunch and we went to Bruegger's but my son wanted pizza. Decided to try out Wolfman and we were not disappointed. The service was great and the server gave perfect suggestions. Very thin crust and lots of pepperoni. Server suggested half and half, and that the New Mexico was a favorite. It was delicious and she even put jalapeños on some of the pieces. Servers were helpful, place is small but not too busy for Sunday lunch. Great pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Three of us shared a Large Big Bad Wolf pizza - the best I've had in years! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Wolfman, located at the intersection of Providence and Ballantyne Commons in the same shopping center as the neighborhood Harris Teeter and Lowe's (across Ballantyne Commons Pkwy from Promenade on Providence).  Parking is a breeze, although watch out for the fukakta speed bumps that are everywhere.  

I had called in an order for a Blue Moo and some Wolfbites with blue cheese for dipping on my way home from work and was told it would be about 15-20 minutes.  Hwy 51 traffic being what it is, I believe I got there about 20 minutes later.  My order was warm and ready to go, the total for the 10\" pizza and the appetizer was just under $18.  

The Blue Moo is not a tomato sauce pizza and is mozzarella, blue cheese, steak (a few pieces), balsamic onions and roasted red peppers on a thin-ish crispy crust.  It was good, although I imagine would be better eaten at the restaurant when it is still hot rather than after a 5 minute ride back to my apartment.  The pizza is slightly larger in size than a Totino's from the freezer and it cut into 4 slices.  You can also get their pizzas as a take-and-bake - that may be a good option too so it is nice and hot.  

The Wolfbites are pinwheels of dough, cheese and a spicy sauce served with your choice of salad dressing.  There are 6 to an order and the spice in the sauce definitely kicks in after your first bite.  It's not spicy while you are eating, but there is an after-burn (not too bad though).  I thought they were quite good with the blue cheese for dipping, but again I think they would be better hot out of the oven. 

The takeout meal was decent, though a little pricier than I am used to paying from the chain places, but I will definitely try another kind of pizza with Wolfbites at another time for eat-in and will update my review then."}
{"text":"Flavorful pizza.  Fantastic local brews.  And our waitress was super friendly.  A great place to unwind and relax."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because they deliver.  Wolfman offers a large selection of original pizzas, most of which are very tasty.  The one thing I will say about their pizza is that I don't love their crust or their pizza sauce, but at least half of the specialty pizzas come with an alternative sauce- I recommend the Greek pizza and the Thai chicken pizza.  The pizza is very yummy when it's hot, but it doesn't seem to keep all that well (it can be very juicy).  The salads are all great too, but I haven't been impressed by their pasta.

UPDATE- every time I order delivery pizza they mess up the order, the pizza is great, but how hard is it to get an order right??"}
{"text":"This is an Ok place I guess, but I've  had much better pizza and would go somewhere else next time. 

The crust is not fresh or hand tossed. It is frozen and slightly better than cardboard. The toppings seem fresh however. The atmosphere is ok. The service is mediocre. There is a good selection of local beers on draft. 

I had high hopes for this place based on reviews. Unfortunately didn't pan out."}
{"text":"At around $8 for a loaded individual pizza makes for a good value. Hard to understand how some choose to get their pizza at the franchise right next door. The pizzas are tasty and most of the ingredients are fresh. Led Zeppelin tasted great, and their marinara is not bad.

 I can't rate it 4 stars because the crust is very doughy, like eating bread. Also the White Wolf -their version of white pizza- uses Swiss cheese and is nowhere as good as a traditional white pizza. In fact Swiss cheese has a distinctive taste and doesn't belong on ANY pizza, you heathens! ;-P"}
{"text":"This place rubbed me the wrong way at first. It was about 98 degrees inside and I came in for a couple slices but couldn't sit in the dining area because it was for eat in only. I asked if I could just sit because I did pay for my food so I am a customer but it was clearly a problem. Luckily enough, the pizza made it for up. Yeah it was hot sitting outside eating, but the pizza was yummy."}
{"text":"I remember why I haven't been to Wolfman Pizza in a while. The service is fine and friendly, but the food is underwhelming. 

Example. I ordered the 10 inch personal pizza. When I was done about 40% of it was crust. Same with my son's kids pizza. 

The good news, it's not very expensive."}
{"text":"I'm glad we chose Wolfman! Our to go order was excellent!!  The bread stix and awesome sauces were yummy!! Also ordered a pizza that was perfectly cooked and prepared!!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I'm pretty snobby about my pizza and was disappointed with many of Charlotte's pizza places. So I was excited when I liked Wolfman Pizza. The sauce is good, and they've got all sorts of pizza flavors and toppings. The lunch special - a slice of pizza, salad and a drink for, I believe, $7 - is a great deal. 

Warning: I love going there to grab some pizza and beer, but the place is occasionally overrun with Myers Park little league teams and the like."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Wolfman. Needless to say I will not eat there again. I was immediately greeted upon entry and my order was taken quickly. I waited a while until the waitress realized my pizza was sitting in the warmer. The pizza was full of grease and not appetizing at all. Thanks but no thanks. I'll stick with Marco's."}
{"text":"Wow last year my wife and brother in law and I went to the 500 and it got rained out till the next day so we had time to kill and was getting hungry. We looked up places to eat and decided to go to wolfman pizza......
It was the best idea we had all day. The workers were great, the atmosphere was cool and the pizza don't even get me started on the pizza ..... Just let me say this one thing.
When my brother in law asked me if i wanted to go to the 500 this year i asked? if we are going to wolfmans again im in..... The best pizza I've ever ever ate !"}
{"text":"Not bad. Family was in charlotte on vacation. Last minute pizza order. The slices where a bigger size but the sauce wasn't great. I'd eat it again if we come back to charlotte."}
{"text":"Got rid of single slice? Now is a 7.00 10' instead. 
Add a salad and drink 15.00. Way to expensive for lunch..."}
{"text":"Good pizza and GREAT customer service. I placed a take out order tonight and when I arrived to pick it up they had mistakenly put the wrong toppings on the pizza. I told them it was no problem and waited for the correct one. Within 30 seconds, the manager, Matt, came out from the back and apologized for the mistake, and immediately refunded the money for the pizza, and also threw in a free 2 liter. I was not expecting this at all and would have came back regardless. The saddest part is that they were surprised that I wasn't extremely upset. Just goes to show you how ridiculous most customers are."}
{"text":"I must give it up for Wolfman. As a former resident of California, their pizza is no more \"California\" than is Taco Bell, but I imagine they're going for the comparison to California Pizza Kitchen.

We love the White Wolf. I also enjoy the pizza with the chicken, spinach and fine herbs. The crusts walk that line between thick and thin very well. I know that folks have crust preferences (NY style, Chicago style, etc), but this might be a crust which embraces all pizza eaters.

The appetizers are great for handling a very hungry table anxiously waiting for the pizza, though not really all that memorable. 

The individual-sized salads are really enough for two to split, and the large size could serve three or more. If it is just the two of you, ask for the individual size and an extra plate, along with the dressing on the side (they often have a pretty heavy hand with the dressing).

NIce folks serving, though the speed of delivery of the food can vary with no discernible reason (e.g., restaurant not really busy, off-peak time, etc). Good selection of beers, and some nightly specials (check their website for details of that night's deal). Seating available outside, which can be a nice touch on a good evening."}
{"text":"Wolfman is one of my favorite spots for pizza. They have creative combinations and there is always a pizza on special each month. 

They have a good (albeit small) beer selection and there are plenty of tables to dine-in. 

Just wish they delivered to my house! 

P.S. There is a dairy queen next door to round out your meal!"}
{"text":"It's been there for years and I had never been. Finally went and wow was it good. Defiantly one of my new fav spots."}
{"text":"If a tasty and fast lunch is what you crave, you've found your calling at Wolfy's.

Wolfman's has several locations throughout the city, but this on Providence Rd. at the dividing line between the Eastover and Myers Park neighborhoods is a lunchtime favorite for my co-workers and I.

So about the lunch- love the special here.  It's your choice of a salad and then a (pretty generous) slice of pizza and it comes with a drink of choice.  You could also opt for 2 slices, but I like their salads quite a bit (especially the California, with the walnuts and goat cheese dressed with balsalmic).  I believe the also added soup as an option recently too.  

Anyway, the lunchtime special includes pizza offerings of cheese and pepperoni and then 2 of their specialty pizzas which change on a rotating basis according to the week day.  Personally, I attempt to go on Tuesdays for the \"Cheeseburger Cheeseburger\" pie.  I know, sounds like it ought to be nasty- but it is crazy good.  Finely ground beef, cheddar cheese, and a sauce base that is tangy with just a hint of sweet.  Yum-o!

Other pizza offerings that are good here- the Thai-style with chicken and peppers and another interesting base sauce to give it some kick.  Also the Southwest with the black bean sauce- wowzers!  

Service is as fast as you need it to be- unless the place is slammed and then it just comes with the territory.  Usually though, we can get in and out of here at lunch faster than most any other sit down spot in and around uptown.  

I also like that drinks here are served in some pretty massive sized glasses.  One to one-and-a-half of these guys and you've got a gully washer on your hands.  Still, it's better than having to hope for refills on any type of frequent basis.

Now the price here is not necessarily budget- but this isn't white table cloth prices, either.  With tax, the lunch special comes out to $7 bucks.  After tip you're out the door for right at or under $10.  Not too bad, especially given the other options nearby.

I also like the ambiance here- long booths line the walls with a few tables down the middle.  This all leads to 2 huge hi-def flat screen in the back- one showing sports while the other does news.  Then the bar area has several TVs lining the wall, this way you and your lunch companions can watch the same show from wherever you sit.  Did I mention they have free wi-fi too?

Not much else I can say- Wolfy's got it down pat for inventive pizza and knows how to work a lunch crowd.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Met up with Nikki for a lunch date here, due to her having bought a Creative Loafing Deals deal for this Coltswold spot.  I have to say, it was around noon when I arrived and there was only a handful of people there.  By one, when we headed out, it was jammin!  So, it's a good lunch crowd.  The server was really great.  She was attentive and knowledgeable.  We split a Caesar salad and a White Wolfman pizza....the salad was o.k and while the pizza was tasty, we had to dunk ours in sauces that we requested (me-ranch and marinara; her-sour cream).......I would have liked a little more something on the pizza, but not sure what.  It was fresh and served at a good temperature.  Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to heading here when in the area."}
{"text":"I know it's a pizza place so generally speaking one should get pizza but the spaghetti and meatball is really tasty and such a good option for delivery if you get burnt out on the more traditional delivery options.  Crust is amazing too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been eating the BLT pizza since I was a little girl, so simple, but so good! The Big Bad Wolf is also a favorite of ours and a must try; but no need to skip dessert, the S'Mores pizza is mouth watering as well!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in the Charlotte area.  Does not offer slices so you have to buy the whole pie."}
{"text":"The guys behind the counter? Nice but stoned.

The pizza? Expensive, high quality ingredients, good crust, affordable with the coupons they have. The mexican was great, the Thai was lacking flavor, and the BBQ chicken was pretty good! 

The salads? Borrrrrrrrrrrrring. Despite the descriptions, they're just lacking serious OOMPH!

The breadsticks? Like Drake sang, \"best i ever had... best i ever had...\"

The decor? Something about the lighting weirds me out.

All in all? It's close, it's open late, I love coupons, I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"This place was a part of my childhood growing up in Charlotte. Friday nights at Wolfman were a regular occurrence. Everyone had their own specialty pizza that they loved. I make it a point to stop in or get a pie for the road every time I go back to Charlotte.

Hands down, the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza is the best thing on the menu in my opinion. A lot of places offer a cheeseburger pizza, but none of them come close to touching the greatness of this one.

It comes with a mustard based sauce which is really what distinguishes this pizza from anywhere else. I crave this amazing piece of heaven. The pizza is so good that while in town for Thanksgiving visiting Kelly's parents, I brought one home for them to try. Let's just say Kelly's mom called us last night and informed us her Saturday night would involve a Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza from Wolfman. I love this place and always will.

That's my word and I'm sticking to it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend the self proclaimed cheeseburger pizza expert claimed this place has the best. We not only had it Saturday but took a take away pizza back to Atlanta and baked it Sunday night. I'm not a huge pizza person but we all loved it. 

Love the concept of \"take and bake\" and it turned out the exact same. Also tried to the White Wolf (fab) and Mykonos (if you like olives then you will love it)."}
{"text":"Decent pizza at a decent price.  It's in Cotswold, so it's a great place to grab a quick lunch after you've done your grocery shopping at Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for pizza since we moved to Charlotte over a year ago and have always had a great experience. Our favorite/go to pizzas switch between the New Mexico and Five Meat pie....though again, everything we have tried has been great. 
We have both called our orders in and used the on-line ordering...never a problem with either. 
The Smores desert pie is amazing though we would like to see a few other desert pies (maybe on a rotating basis?)
Since we live close we have always done take out so I can't speak to the dine-in experience.
We always recommend people new to the area try here first if they are looking for a great pizza place."}
{"text":"I'm always happy at Wolfman Pizza.  We go to the one on Providence Road.  Their hand-tossed pizzas are delicious & not too thick (as I like thin-crust better anyway).  Their chicken wings are the best I've found and not smothered in batter.  Their wolfbites are just little pizzas, so don't get them if you're ordering pizza, but they would be great mini-pizzas for kids.  I wish they made them with a bit more of the toppings/fillings.  It's a great place to go and watch sports without being overwhelmed with people & you lose the dining aspect of it.  I feel this is a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I'm glad the pizza & wings were as good as the ones I was remembering from the unfortunately defunct Providence Road location.

The service was o.k., but I missed seeing some of the faces I was used to.  This location is much smaller, so it can be a turnoff if it gets too many rowdy kids.  

The TV's are high up on the wall and hard to watch, so that takes away from being able to sit and enjoy the game while you eat.

I might get food to go from here, but I probably won't dine in.

Oh, well.  I'll miss you Providence Road Wolfman."}
{"text":"I've always loved wolfman pizza since Barry brought California style pizza to Charlotte, NC in 1991.  Great food and great management make eating here a no brainer.  I've found the Providence Commons location to be very consistent even during busy times.  Their wolf bites with their home made bleu cheese are a great starter and their buffalo chicken pizza is off the hook.  YUM!!"}
{"text":"For a consistently good pizza, Wolfman is our top choice in the area. The restaurant has interesting decor, although is a bit small, which isn't a problem for us as we tend to carryout or have the food delivered. The delivery almost always occurs prior to the timeline given, and the delivery guy has always been very friendly.

Wolfman pizza really is the best in the Cotswold area, and the breadsticks with three dip options are also very good. We generally get a salad with our meal (have to throw in some greens for at least a small attempt at healthiness), and the greek salad with dressing is a solid choice. We've tried the pepperoni, extra cheese, and the veggie pizza and have not been disappointed. On top of pizza, there is an extensive menu of pasta and sandwich options, which we've yet to try as the pizza is always so good.

Only downside is that Wolfman doesn't really offer \"deals\" like some of the other chains, so can be a bit pricey. But if you're looking for good pizza and breadsticks, and don't mind paying full price, the Wolfman in Cotswold is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love me some Wolfman!
They are possibly my #1 favorite pizza place in Charlotte. They have some amazing California style pizzas that are very different from the standard pizzas we see at restaurants. The broad varieties include Thai (my personal favorite), Mexican, Greek / Mediterranean, Italian (duh!), Hawaiian, Caribbean, American, Southern (BBQ), vegetarian, ASIAN (hoisin and tofu) and then narrower varieties of the American and Italian.

If this is your first time, I would recommend getting the Thai and White Wolf. They do half-and-half which is what I prefer if it's my first time or if I want to try more varieties.
if this isn't your first time and you have already tried the above recommendations (or if they don't appeal to you), go for the Big Bad Wolf and the Chicken Parmesan. See how I made you try one of their \"wolf\" pizzas both times? Because they are delicious!!
But don't feel obligated to try my recommendations. ALL of their pizzas are great so you would never go wrong with any combination you pick.
They have some White Zombie (or Zombie White) beer which is really good too.

Also, look out for their monthly specials that always cost a couple dollars less. And if you have the same pet peeves as me, try not to let the \"!\" at the end of every pizza name on their menu copy annoy you. As a side note, their \"Howlin' Hot\" delivery car always makes me happy."}
{"text":"Originally from Chicago, I have a penchant for pizza. And I don't discriminate. I like it thick or thin, cheesy or saucy, loaded with veggies or plain cheese. I've been to Wolfman a few times, a couple times for lunch, once for dinner and one takeout order. 

Inside, Wolfman is a pretty standard, but comfy, pizza joint. The booths are roomy and it smells like divine pizza. The staff has always been super friendly, seating hubs and I at a booth to our liking and quickly getting us set up with drinks and menus. I'm a fan of speedy service!

And the menu - Wolfman is full of creative pies - just like Ted M. said. My personal faves are White Wolf and the Veg-o-Matic. The White Wolf is a white pie - no red sauce, but instead piled high with various cheeses, garlic and other goodies. This particular pie can be a little greasy for my liking, but it's nothing that a paper towel can't remedy. Yes, I'm that girl.

The Veg-o-Matic is just what you would think, a pizza stacked with plenty of veggies. It should also be noted that just about everything at Wolfman is made in house - i.e. they don't use canned pizza sauce, pineapple, etc. 

Price wise, Wolfman is pretty average, almost affordable, if you're not a big eater. Pizza always makes the best leftovers!

They also offer a great lunch special - $6.49 for one (massive) slice, a side salad and a drink. Or for the same price you can forgo the salad and score two slice and a drink. Love me a lunch special!"}
{"text":"I moved in the cotswald area recently and was hungry while unpacking. So my wife whom was ordering got some small pizza and the total came up to around $23 i will never eat here or order from here again. Being from NY, this pizza joint is different and the taste was not to my liking at all"}
{"text":"It's hard to find delivery with a decent salad selection... this place rocks, fresh crisp salads and yummy pizza! Quick delivery! Wolfman is now programmed in my mobile."}
{"text":"Fresh pizza dough, fresh ingredients straight from the farm and pizza combinations that you don't expect.  This was my first time eating here and it won't be the last. The staff is very friendly and took the time to explain all the combos and answer any questions we had.
   Much better pizza than any I have had in recent memory."}
{"text":"Service is so fast! The food is good, especially the innovative salad  choices. My son loves the bread sticks with 3 dipping sauces-asiago cheese, sun dried tomato, and marinara.

Fun  outdoor seating available. Very casual place. Heard it was a chain down here but, as a former Chicagoan, I am particular about pizza and his is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Met up for a lunch date at the Cotswold location. Seems to be a happening lunch spot as the place filled up shortly after 12. Our server was simply amazing - very knowledgeable about the menu and took the time to suggest her favorites. Brandi and I decided to split the large Caesar salad and try the pie of the month, the white wolf. The Caesar was good but just your typically Caesar salad - although props to Wolfman for not drowning the salad in dressing. Appreciate that! The white wolf is a simple pizza, just what I wanted, with white sauce, basil and chopped tomatoes. All in all pretty tasty but there was hardly an sauce on it which made it pretty dry. Glad we requested sauces (sour cream for me, ranch for her) to make up for it. 

Looking at the menu, I'd love to try a panini (they sound delicious!) or another pizza, like the buffalo chicken. I'll definitely head back, seems like a great spot to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a descent. I got the lunchtime special which was a slice of pizza, salad and a drink. I was meatless for the day and from the choices available, I chose cheese. I liked it but the sauce reminded me too much of pasta sauce. So that was a little weird to me. Overall I'm looking forward to trying other pizza flavors."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. They have a good lunch special. I had a California side salad and a slice of pizza. The salad was very good, spinach and goat cheese and really good tomatoes, which is hard to find this time of year.  The pizza was delish. The crust was bubbly and chewy, (my favorite) and the pizza itself was not greasy. It was flavorful and filling. I had peppers, sausage and onion. I work nearby, so will be back! Great service too!"}
{"text":"NY pizza purists beware! You'll see black beans. Cheddar. Thai flavors. Jerk chicken. Things that could almost take these pizzas to snobby flatbreadland.

But the tastes are sharp, toppings fresh. Flavor combos pretty awesome. And they're sympathetic to veggie whining, so you can sub stuff in and out easily, with no extra charge.

Plus they deliver. Quickly. And haven't screwed my orders up yet (knock on wood).

Prices are a tad high, but like I said, quality stuffs are being used. A take on pie that's somewhat new to me, so this could be beginner's love. (If you guys really wanna slay the veg set, add tofu to the topping list!)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Wolfman Pizza for years now. Took the fam for dinner last week to this location near Providence Rd & I-485. It was busy but we were seated right away. My better halves (wife & daughter) split the White Wolf pizza, their regular, and enjoyed the hell out of it. Me, I was feeling adventurous, so I tried the Buffalo Chicken pizza. It did have a \"kick\" to it, but I've never had celery and carrots on a pizza. Although it wasn't bad, definitely not my favorite. Now, we don't normally order dessert here but for some reason we did this night. The S'mores dessert pizza was super tasty and really hit the spot. Took some home and had it the next day and it was just as good. The service here is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Charlotte. I wish they would expand... like up to New Jersey so I could eat there more often! Try their mexican style pizza. Last I remember, you could call in and order your pizza and then take it home and cook it at home... but it's been a while since I  have been there."}
{"text":"Went to Wolfman today and truly don't understand the bad reviews. It's California-style pizza, says so right on the sign, so don't expect NY-style. That said, I prefer a thinner crust, but theirs was cooked until crunchy and was not sweet. All of the toppings tasted fresh, and the meat toppings were all cooked properly. Not oversauced, which is usually a problem at chains. A great price for a pretty great product."}
{"text":"good service . crust like soft Pita bread and bland . okay ..but not great . live close so will probably return ."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. Grew up as a kid eating here and my taste buds were just screaming for the loaded potato pizza the other night. Pineapple chicken one is also a fav. You can't go wrong with meat lovers or pep."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza is the Baked Potato. You must get it with sour cream. If you don't get the sour cream, don't even bother getting the pizza! Either the recipes have changed or my tastes have changed, by the pizzas seem more greasy in recent visits. I've been going to Wolfman Pizza for over 15 years! Maybe that makes me a little nostalgic but this has always been my favorite pizza place. 

Service is dependent on which kid is working as they employee lots of youngsters."}
{"text":"Quick lunch while waiting for a prescription at the nearby Teeter. It was busy for lunchtime, but I was able to take a seat and place my order quickly. Lunch specials are either a slice and a salad or two slices, each with a soda. I chose the latter.

Special slices rotate on a day by day basis, but today was the White Wolf (veggies and fresh basil) and the New York, New York (lots of meat). I went with one of each.

Since the pizzas aren't made to order for the lunch special, it didn't take long for them to arrive at my table. The NY, NY was greasy as expected. The White Wolf was tasty and needed only a little shake of the red pepper to kick it up. Sadly, neither slice was especially hot when they arrived.

It was okay for quick, but I think I liked the Pizza Peel nearby much better."}
{"text":"The Pizza here was not the best I've ever had.
I had the white wolf and was very disappointed in the flavor. We also ordered wolf bites which were nothing special at all. They even charged us $0.50 extra for more ranch.....just an overall lack of flavor mixed with disappointment."}
{"text":"Really good pizza....   great service....   def will re-visit again...   good pizza and sports on the tv, what else could you ask for"}
