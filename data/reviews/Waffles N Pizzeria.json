{"text":"This pizza is good!!
I used Uber Eats to order two large pizzas and fries..one with just pepperoni and one Bronx. Both were cooked perfectly. Huge pizza and huge slices. Fries were just fries but I wasn't asking for anything else. They weren't soggy or anything..You can feed a lot of peeps for an affordable price for sure. I usually don't order from a place I have never physically been to..but I made an exception and it was good. I wish to vist this place the next time I want pizza and all I can hope is I meet nice people and a well maintanined establishment to match the delicious pizza.."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order for our office for lunch today. There were a variety of items ordered including pizzas, pasta, burgers, and salads. The first problem came with the delivery. They were to deliver the food by 11:30 am. The food didn't actually arrive until 12:40 pm. Over an hour late! And the food was originally ordered at 10:30 am. Then there is the problem of the food. Overall, the food is not good. Virtually each of my coworkers that ordered food complained about something. I personally got the Margarita Pizza and it was so overcooked that there was almost no sauce left. The tomatoes on top were shriveled up like sun dried tomatoes. The crust was hard and barely edible. Trying to eat this thing was making a desert in my mouth. This seemed to have been the case with almost every pizza in our whole order. Frozen pizzas that you cook in the microwave are better. Truly an unacceptable experience."}
{"text":"So I ordered the philly cheesesteak and medium wing and coke. The guy in the phone was nice and the food came on time. Unfortunately the food was ehh. Edible sure and some good flavors but the meet was really dry and there was no cheese. Kind of important for a cheesesteak. The wings where small and a little sad but they are yummy enough. Disappointing, but not totally not worth it."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food no matter the category. We got wings, burger with fries, and pasta. Wings were rubbery, smelt of a pet store, and looked old. The burger smelled off and the veggies were not fresh, like slimy. Finally, the pasta was old too with very little sauce and some hard dried spots on the noodles.. Will never get food here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. The prices are impossible to beat for what you get. I had the bbq burger and fries. It was greasy spoon food and it did the trick without breaking the bank. Delivery was much faster than I anticipated and my office is a little tricky to find. I was expecting a phone call for further instructions but heard a knock on the door instead. Will use again!."}
{"text":"This place needs to be avoided at all costs.  It is surrounded by tweakers and when you order food for carryout, the owner will make you wait outside while being accosted and harassed by the tweakers asking for money or meth, they will not stop asking you.

Do not ever order from this place, give them zero business, they do not care about their customers or their image, I can only assume they are a front for a meth dealing operation."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this place twice through Postmates and have not been disappointed.  Both times the pizza was great, crust not thick and greasy and they use real cheese!  Their medium wings are also good if you do not want to have to you tongue burn off but still want the spicy flavor.  

I came here for breakfast to try the red velvet waffles and it was delish!  It was certainly worth what I paid for.  

Not sure why people have a bad rating, must be competitors trying to pull this place down in ratings because I saw none of the issues they raised."}
{"text":"First, the staff was very kind and extremely helpful. I ordered one of their desserts online with my order, but they'd already sold out, so they called me to apologize and offer something else - I was already ordering a pizza and a hot dog, so it was a covert win to have no dessert. They gave me a fresh salad and an EXTRA HOT DOG (delicious) to make up for the dessert, at no additional cost to me. 

The other two reviews are a bummer; the pizzas are cheap so you can't expect gourmet, but they absolutely satisfy. 

The location also seems like a foolish thing to complain about; order delivery and get an extra hot dog like meee! 

These people definitely care about their customers and they also have a salad with fresh pineapple and bell peppers and a sesame vinaigrette. Give em a chance guys."}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered through EAT24 and food arrived over 30 minutes after the promised time. No call from the restaurant with a heads up they were running late or an apology. Pizza and wings were cold and they forgot my dressing for my salad. EAT24 facilitated a 15% discount off the order as well as took off the 15% tip that I added initially when I placed the order. Perhaps this was a fluke based on the few positive reviews this place has on Yelp but I will definitely not be ordering again from this place and would recommend you think twice before doing so."}
