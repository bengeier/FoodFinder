{"text":"It's pretty rare to find a good filipino place to eat. Unfortunately this place isn't great. I've actually partially given up on filipino restaurants I'm just going to take advice from my mom and cook it all at home. I bought stew from this place and it's a stew my mom made religiously since I was younger. It had this grainy earthy taste to it. Honestly, there's no better way to describe it than the following... It tastes like they did not wash the meat thoroughly before cooking or cook it enough. On too of the fact that their food offerings looked pretty sad and not so vibrant. When I went in there they didnt exactly jump to the occasion of having a customer in store ready to give them money. They just acted like I interrupted them from watching their show in the tv hanging from he wall. I decided to buy a bottle of sauce as well and it was dusty. Like, filmy and dusty. Try don't take pride in their merchandise or food. 

This is so sad because they have such a great opportunity to make filipino food good but obviously, they should just shut the doors and continue to watch their shows...."}
{"text":"This store/take out place is now out of business. I only went there a couple of times and it is seems too expensive for a combo - $8.99 and the sad part is that it's not that good. I think it is best to cook home made meals than go here."}
{"text":"I went to get some take out, I asked the \"tindero (seller)\" that I would like to buy a combo special but if possible he could separate the rice from the stewed meat. I do this because its \"take out\" and when I get back to my workplace I don't want my rice soggy from the sauce. The \"tindero\" refused because he said  that it was no longer a combo if it was separated. I offered to pay for an extra styrofoam container, the owner refused. I was rather disappointed and angry to be refused  for what I thought was a reasonable request. I never went back again; also the food is not that good I go there because its the closest filipino joint to my workplace. The food is bland!!

I do not recommend the food or the owners attitude to customers."}
