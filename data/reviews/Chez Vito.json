{"text":"Very nice and consistently good quality meat...that's unfortunately very expensive (my only gripe with this place really).  Before going to Vito's I never thought that there could be such variations in the taste of a cut of pork...now I know.  Service is always warm and friendly. These guys also have a great memory for faces. I only go there 8 or 10 times per year and they always seem to remember me and most of their customers.  It's also the only place I know of where I can get my fix of authentic Italian Limonata (not the one made in the States)."}
{"text":"Meats and charcuterie are perfection.  I drive up from Vermont and always make sure to bring something home from Chez Vito.  Family run and extremely knowledgeable staff"}
{"text":"Friendly family run butcher shop with a wide selection meats and Italian groceries. Despite the Yelp categorization, they do not make sandwiches here. You can buy all the best ingredients but sandwiches are not for sale."}
{"text":"Produits frais, bien préparés, excellents,j'ai craqué pour la viande, l'huile d'olive calabrèse, le café équitable et le parmesan importé"}
{"text":"Sympathique boucherie de quartier. La qualité des viandes et le service sont irréprochables. On y retrouve aussi une variété de produits fins italiens."}
{"text":"This is a great butcher in the mile end area and the staff is also super nice. Also, if you're into coffee, they have great machines and coffee to buy.  AND, the best part, every Friday they get a whole Porchetta, absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Chez Vito is one of my favourite butchers in Montreal. Friendly service and great small-talk with the guys when you come in and they will always help you find the perfect steak for you.   Honestly, whenever we are in the mood for steak, we'd rather go buy their marinated bavette and cook at home instead of going out. The marinade is very simple (oil, paprika, steak spice, salt, pepper) and not overpowering. With a cast-iron pan and some animal fat for frying, you can make a restaurant quality meal in no time.   Another great thing about this place are the wonderful Italian products they import. The other day, Dino had me try some special Mortadella he had imported (the name escapes me). It was soft, perfectly flavoured and melt-in-your mouth good.   If you're looking for a butcher in the Plateau/Mile-End, look no further. Chez Vito ranks among the top 3 butchers in the city and his prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Fresh meat, tasty cheese and a lot of Italian delicatessen. Best charcuterie ever and not so expensive at all."}
{"text":"Great butcher with pre-marinated steaks, homemade sausage, veal oxtail, pork shoulder, ...!  If you don't see something in the counter, make sure to ask as they keep a lot in the back."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?  Chez Vito is a mainstay of the Mile End scene, the place where all the goodfellas pick up their steaks and roasts, their pork chops and shoulders, their scottaditi-style lamb chops, their organic birds, and their hot and sweet sausages.  Chez Vito is also an unbelievably friendly family-run establishment--so full of good old-fashioned bonhomie that the place is almost a parody of your classic old-school butcher shop.  Whole porchetta is served gratis on Saturdays, and it's especially tasty (and plentiful) when you show up early.  Oh, yeah:  they also happen to have a pretty impressive collection of taxidermy, if you're into that kinda thing.  If they carried any grass-fed meat, they'd get a 6/5.  Essential."}
