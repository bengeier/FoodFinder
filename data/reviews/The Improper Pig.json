{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday at 11:30. We ordered the food and received it in under 10 minutes. Fastest time I've ever received food. Food is great and so is the staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience and food.  As new residents to Charlotte we were excited to try new places.  My husband tried the special, a burger with bbq and blue cheese.  He asked that it be cooked medium.  He received a very well done burger that was incredibly dry.  When he asked about it, our waitress told him they could only cool it to that temperature because of the pork belly they added.  That might have been helpful to know when ordering.  Overall the entire time our waitress continually forgot to bring us very basic things, like beverages, sauce, our check.  Finally after waiting my husband found her talking to her coworkers and gave her our card to run.  She seemed annoyed by that as well.  It was a Sunday night and there were maybe 12 people total dining at the time.  It wasn't busyness, it was laziness."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped here for lunch and I am so happy we did!    The jalelopeno appetizer is amazing. I had the Cotswald Burger and chip both were amazing. The Burger had great flavors.   My husband had the Portabello Stacker Burger and pasta salad. Both very good but I still prefer the Cotswald."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my dad on a visit to Charlotte. He remembered it from an episode of Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives. The meat on our burgers was very good and cooked to our desired level of doneness. However, my \"smoke house\" burger had almost no smokiness. Additionally, the house-made salt and vinegar chips almost surely had no vinegar (but they were house made). With some more focus on flavors, this would be a very good burger place but it fell a bit short in my eyes."}
{"text":"The fish tacos is what I always go for   Collard greens are without a doubt some of the best I have tried.  One of my favorite lunch spots"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here May 3rd.  We had brisket YUM and pork and egg roll appetizers one with pork and one with sweet potatoes (this was the only item I wouldn't get again).  Sides were mac and cheese, brussel sprouts YUM and collards  The flavors were great - the meat was  very moist,  and had a very light smoky flavor.  I expected a smokier meat, but it was so delicate and moist and tasted fresh that I'm definitely a fan.    It was also neat that there are Asian influences in some of the menu items as sauces, so this is an typical bbq place.    It is a little pricier than typical BBQ restaurants, but I thought the quality of food and flavors was worth the price- all the sides were a little better than you would normally find.and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I would rate this bbq as just ok. It was little dry and adding sauce was essential to ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. They gave you a lot of food and the price was fair. The full bar is good and the cocktail I had was decent.  There is not really much atmosphere inside, but bbq is not really known for being a trendy place.   The sweet potato hash side was actually gross as it had this weird bbq sauce taste in it so I only tried one spoonful of it and gave up on it. The improper nachos appetizer was not well executed either since it wasn't even nachos, it was greasy potato chips covered in cheese so give that one a pass as well."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was a little apprehensive to meet with their catering manager about catering our wedding. But, we got a proper taste test and sampled all their vegetarian fare and it's DELICIOUS. Jess Randall has worked diligently with us throughout this process to put together a menu that meets our budget and our personal taste/dietary preferences. We're super excited about the tofu barbeque we'll be serving, on top of everything else. PLUS, she's helped us to meet some pretty stringent requirements from our venue.  I'll have to update this review after the actual event, but so far we love The Improper Pig more than vegetarians should and we highly recommend them for your catering needs!  UPDATE: Improper Pig really came through for us on the wedding day! Some of our guests had strong opinions about our vegetarian wedding, but when it was all said and done we got nothing but compliments. If you're a vegetarian and don't know if Improper Pig is a good spot for you, I say TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Formerly Mama Fu's, the Improper Pig throws it's hat in the ring filled with many hats regarding BBQ in Charlotte.   Cool atmosphere, great service. Owner came by and made sure everything was good.   Food - wife loved her pulled chicken with sweet potato hash and coleslaw. I liked, hot loved, my pulled pork, but really enjoyed the creamy man-and-cheese and sweet potato waffle fries. They killed it on the sides. Also came with a jalapeño corn bread slice. They also have 6 different sauces so I poured it on.  Will be back, I want to try that pulled chicken my wife is raving about. I did improper things to that macaroni though."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I have never felt the pressing need to review a restaurant so this is my first one. I have also only gotten food here for take out, I have never dined in but... THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! I feel like I am probably going to become on a first name basis with the people that work here. The food is different but is the perfect combination of everything delicious you could think of. I literally want to try everything on the menu.  I love the pulled pork sandwhich with sweet potatoes fries (with a side of ranch for those) and the mac and cheese is good too. Today for lunch I got a pulled chicken BBQ salad...I could have eaten five of them it was so good.  The people that work here are extremely personable and I could not be happier to see this restaurant come to Cotswold.  Keep up the good work! I can't wait to try something new next time!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Service was good but ribs were tough and cornbread was dry. Stick to the smoked wings, Mac and cheese, or stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying this restaurant and I can say this will definitely be in my top five restaurants to visit if asked what would I like to eat. I had the Cotswold Plate with chicken, green beans, and collard greens. I also had the Good Luck soup which had collard greens, black eyed peas, and shredded pork. I felt lucky after eating it! The cornbread was amazing! It had this kind subtle spice to it that would go perfect with any food that you could eat. The main course with its seasonings and was flavored to perfection. I also scored a free egg roll which was filled with sweet potato hash and collard greens wrapped in an egg roll coating. Delicious. Our server was very sweet and attentive with us. Answered all of our questions as this was my first time visiting the restaurant. Also, the Coca Cola, which is my favorite soda, was the perfect consistency of carbonation to syrup. Best coke I've tasted from a restaurant fountain in a very long time. If you get a chance to try something new and are in the mood for something amazing, try The Improper Pig."}
{"text":"I had a brisket plate with Asian coleslaw and baked beans, everything including the service was excellent. Next time i will try something new."}
{"text":"Driving through Charlotte and decided to hunt down a unique barbecue experience and The Improper Pig did not disappoint. Our server suggested the Charcuterie Sampler and the Side Plate for us to share. Best idea ever! Thanks, Brittany! Hubby said the brisket rivals Jack's in Nashville--which is high praise indeed. So glad we found this spot. And slather the warmed pimento cheese on the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Careful attention to service, presentation, lighting, mood, and of course the menu is evident at the Improper Pig.  Vegetarians are welcome.  We will try the Portobello burger next time, but for our first visit we did lots and lots of sides and LOVED EVERY ONE.  There is not a mediocre item on the sides menu; the spices are innovative and well chosen. In fact the \"improper\" part of the name really means innovative to us. Proper is boring and predictable.  This is not.  And save room for that chocolate pie, which is just an amazing piece of impropriety!"}
{"text":"Arrived just before 7pm on a friday night, little surprised to see a nearly empty restaurant.  But had a great meal and dining experience.  I ordered the pork sandwich, with coleslaw and baked beans.  My wife ordered pulled chicken with coleslaw.  Both were very tasty.  Only criticism would be the servings were a little smaller than I had expected.  Would recommend to friends and we will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed... I tried twice but not impressed either time. The décor is nice but that is about it. I am not a fan of BBQ to begin with but this seemed like a neat place and I wanted to like it. The first time I tried the Asian shrimp tacos. The sauce was good however the shrimp was lacking. I had 3 on each taco and the corn taco was like rubber. Had I known it was a corn taco I would have passed. The second time I thought I would try the mac and cheese expecting it to be homemade, maybe a nice crust but instead it was runny. On the 2nd trip my friend ordered a margarita and I don't know how to describe it other than bad, very bad."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting The Improper Pig. I decided to get my food to go. The hostess was very nice professional and when I told her it was my first time she was more than willing to help me. She directed me to the bar to place my order to go. The bartender taking orders was rude , unprofessional, didn't even bother to go over menu items with me she just rang up my food and never said a word. Not sure if she was having a bad day or not but she was very rude. After walking around and leaving me at the bar for 20 with not a drop of water nor was I offered a drink or anything. But the guy eating watching basketball with his son got all the service. ( guess I should have eaten in instead of takeout). The food was great!! the green beans excellent!! That is the only reason I will go back because of the food and the hostess.As for the rude bartender I hope she has better days. But Ill be back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.  Definitely happy with the bbq and will be back.  Completely different experience from Midwood Smokehouse and for the better IMO."}
{"text":"had the brisket tacos with a side of brussel sprouts.  ate at the bar.  our server was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive.  the taco, side, and sauce were all great.  should be successful."}
{"text":"Like a previous reader I too wanted to like this place more than I did. This was my second time visiting.   Ambience is cool, whoever designed the place should be proud. Need a better choice of music to complement the design. Too much like the lobby of a W hotel.   Seated promptly. Served promptly. Attentive service but felt hurried at end even with no people waiting for tables. Felt like I didn't even put my fork down before waiter was over asking if I was done. Best part of a BBQ joint is picking over your plate long after you're \"done\".   Kids had pulled pork sammys with Mac n cheese. Sammys were good. Mac n cheese was grainy if that's a word. Like the flour didn't have time to dissolve or something. Could have used more kick or sharpness too.   I had the BBQ charcuterie plate and a side of Brussels sprouts. At $18 I was surprised at how small the portions were. Scratch that. Disappointed.   Came with andouille sausage, brisket, pulled pork and 2 ribs and a teeny tiny corn muffin, some orange stuff that I'm not sure about, cole slaw and some very good house made potato chips.   LOVED the ribs. Very good flavor and texture and color. By far the highlight. Second was the sausage which surprised me since I normally do do smoked sausage. Brisket was cut too thin and was dry. Wouldn't recommend. Pulled pork was ok. Not much flavor. Cole slaw might as well have come from the prepared food aisle at Harris Teeter. The Brussels sprouts were oh so disappointing. Overdone. Too much pepper. With all the great meats in this place, no clue why they sprouts aren't served more al dente with bacon or pulled pork and some carmelization. These were like the Brussels sprouts that everyone ate growing up resulting in all of us hating Brussels sprouts. Anyway.   Nice selection of sauces on the table, including a couple that are Asian themed. Only issue is that they have odd caps on the sauces which makes the sauce dribble out and all over the bottle making them sticky and sort of gross. The bring regular napkins to the table but BBQ needs a strong paper towel. Napkins don't do. And considering the sticky sauces, some wet wipes would be a good touch too.   All in all I would come back but specifically for the ribs and chips. And I would bring my own towel and wet wipes."}
{"text":"Great food, great concept and great....superb sides! Only one issue with this place, they need to step up their beer game. I like that they have a large selection of cans but they are often out of popular selections or lack variety.   The cheese grits are the best in the city."}
{"text":"I had the chance to check this place out a couple of months ago with a friend for dinner. I had heard about the place and finally had the time to visit on a rainy Saturday evening. I ordered the Cotswald plate with smoked chicken and a side of slaw and sweet potato hash. I loved the variety of sauces which I enjoyed for the Asian influence since I am not really feeling the Carolina mustard style (I am not a native Carolinian to be fair :-). My favorite sauce was the hoisin with the Tongs Thai coming in a close second.   Overall the food was excellent. I will be back again because there are several other items on the menu I would love to try including the improper charcuterie as well as the ribs and other sauces.  not to mention the chocolate pie with bacon was awesome .. and not part of my healthy lifestyle but.. never the less Awesome!!"}
{"text":"O...Ver.....Priced.   I ordered the largest single plate of food on the menu for $14, expecting to split it with my 18mo old and she at the whole thing because it was such a small portion of food.   The food itself was good but not as good as Mac's, Midwood Smokehouse, Sauceman's or even Moe's in Matthews.   Service was great, but I accounted for maybe 75% of their business in the off hours. So not a true test.   Bonus: It's the only place this far that serves pork and slaw egg rolls. Worthy of it's price at $4.   Bottom line. The Improper pig would be a huge hit if it were located in a place without such stellar BBQ - like the Midwest. But in CLT, it falls to the bottom of the list due to it's high prices for small portion of average food."}
{"text":"Service by Michelle was excellent (I may be biased) for our party of 9 near the bar.  It was also a meetup for a bourbon tasting.  Things were a little slow to come together, but once the drinks and food starting flowing, everyone had a great time.  I wanted to try one of everything so the charcuterie offered sausage, rib, pulled pork, and brisket.  Was not a huge fan of their homemade chips, but the pimiento and slaw were very yummy sides.  Juicy, flavorful meats, 6 sauces to choose from and sturdy napkins (essential in any BBQ joint!) Speaking of yummy - GET THE GRITS!! Oh Em Gee.  You're Welcome :)  Bathrooms are clean, ample parking, crowd was not rowdy on a Monday evening.  I'll have to remember next time to ask about their Improper Pig mascot/theme."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, literally just around the corner.   I was in a few weeks for the first time with my partner and two of our friends. The place was packed but we luckily got a seat within 5 minutes!  The one disappointment that we had was that it took 15 minutes for anyone to recognize that we had not been waited on, yet. At this point, we were all hungry and thirsty (as we did not have waters, not were we able to place our adult beverage orders). There was a waitress, however, that had walked by and noticed we had not been waited on and immediately stopped to take our order and wait on us (mind you she was actually supposed to be leaving or the night, but stayed to wait on us, which I thoroughly commend her for doing this and appreciate it most graciously!)  Upon ordering our drinks, our apps, and our entrees we were very pleased with the service, the drinks, and the food! The Improper Nachos (with Brisket added) were absolutely PHENOMENAL! We ate them very quickly. During eating the Improper Nachos, the manager had made his way over (as our wonderful waitress had explained to him that we had been forgotten) and he promptly and happily comped the Nachos for us.   The entrees were delicious and we all definitely enjoyed ourselves!  I most DEFINITELY and HIGHLY recommend the Improper Pig, wonderful staff and wonderful food/barbecue! I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was cold when it came out. It was exactly the same when the waitress brought it back out so I figured the just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds instead of replacing the order..smh I ordered one of their signature cocktail which taste like cheap liquor with a splash of food coloring for color. Will not be going back to this location for a long time if ever."}
{"text":"Everyone is a restaurant critic... I'm glad to have a Q joint close to me! The Mac is good and the greens are too. Cheese grits nice touch. Is this the greatest BBQ on the planet? No. But its certainly good and the sides are too. So hey, be glad it's not another chain sandwich/bakery/hamburger joint. Ugh! Beef brisket around the corner from my house... I'm there!"}
{"text":"Here's a quick summary of the following novel: After my first lunch at The Improper Pig, here's my assessment. The pulled pork was delicious, the brisket the same though a little fatty, the mac and cheese was good, stay away from the sweet potato hash, and don't sit at the high tables. For an in-depth review, keep reading.   The Meal  I ordered the Cotswold Platter, which consisted of 2 meats and 2 sides. I chose the brisket (which happened to be a slightly-shady extra $4, but I'll talk about that more later) and the pulled pork for my meats. The sides available were pretty varied, but my first choice was the mac and cheese (what I believe to be a staple in any good BBQ restaurant). For my second side, I decided to try the sweet potato hash, something I had never heard of and was interested in.  We'll start with the meats:    The pulled pork was fantastic. I have found that I'm hard to please with pulled pork, and this really hit the spot. It was very flavorful and moist enough that it didn't require any sauce to eat (I like the flavor of good barbecue without dousing it in sauce). Quite possibly the best pulled pork I've had in Charlotte.    The beef brisket, while a little on the fatty side, was also delicious. My favorite brisket in Charlotte still comes from Lancaster BBQ, but this was a close second. Improper's version is more pulled than sliced, which was a nice change, and was good enough to eat by itself. The extra fat took it down a slight notch, but the flavor was great.    With the meats, there are 5 or 6 different options for sauces. There's a Thai sauce, mustard BBQ, regular BBQ (tomato), Eastern NC BBQ (vinegar), and Frank's Redhot (I forget if there's another). The Thai was sweet with a little spice, very good. The mustard, which is my favorite usually, was very good here also.  As for the sides, the mac and cheese was good, nothing to write home about, but a strong staple and something I would order again. A little more saucy than some of the baked versions you'll find at other BBQ joints, but good none-the-less. The sweet potato hash, on the other hand, was a disappointment. My coworkers and I all agreed that we could definitely have done without it. What it seemed to be was a version of sweet potato casserole without brown sugar; a bland mash, maybe slightly bitter, with no real redeeming quality unfortunately.  The meal also came with what looked like a cornbread cookie and some red onions (maybe pickled onions? I didn't try them, I thought they were maybe just for show). The cornbread was alright, it didn't really add or detract from the meal. But then again, I'm used to a larger portion of moist cornbread, maybe with a little bit of honey, and I might just be spoiled.  All in all, the meal was good, with one regrettable side choice, but I would otherwise order it again. Good flavors and good portions.   The Rest  The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, the kitchen is open and visible, and it felt appropriate for a nicer BBQ restaurant. Not much to talk about, save for two things. One, they should put some sort of blinds or window covering on the larger windows as it is darker inside, and the outside light can be a little blinding. Two, they need to get nicer chairs for the high tables. The chairs they have seem to be there for looks more than functionality. The seats are small (I bet they're not far off from 9 in x 9 in) and are just plain uncomfortable. The booths seem like they sit nice, and the higher chairs at the bar seem nice. But the chairs at the high tables are a bit of an inconvenience.  As someone with just enough graphic design understanding to get himself in trouble, the menu made me cringe a bit. The layout doesn't flow well at all, and its confusing to read at first. Once you can figure out where everything is, it isn't hard, but I feel like it shouldn't be that hard to read a one page menu. Not a big deal, just a random quirk. Do pay attention though to the prices. The menu does a poor job of letting you know about extra costs. The brisket is apparently an extra $4, I'm assuming for all entrees, and it wasn't immediately apparent to me. Just something to keep an eye out for.   If you're still reading, you're a trooper :-)  To finish this book, after my lunch experience, I will most likely be heading back to The Improper Pig, but with a better understanding of the menu, the cost, and the seating. I can't stay away from a place with meat this good, I just hope I can find some sides that match in flavor!"}
{"text":"My new favorite!!!  This was our second time in as many weeks and we'll definitely be back.  This place is unique and affordable to boot.  I can't recommend it enough.    Meal one - the cutlery: a sample of ribs,pork, brisket and sausage. It was just the right amount without being too filling.   Meal two - BBQ Salad with Chicken.  I switched dressing to the vinaigrette.  simply awesome."}
{"text":"We so really want this place to be better than it is. Most of the time the service is good but the portions are sometimes small and the food is not that great. Sometimes we go there and the food is amazing but the service isn't great. I wish they would be more consistent. We've been there at least 10 times. One manager is kind of weird."}
{"text":"Terrific service. The pulled chicken BBQ sandwich was basic and why shouldn't it be; however, I would like to see a choice of bun. The bun is like a Costco super saver kids' birthday party bun. Plain. White. I chose sweet potato fries. Too salty. Like big, chunky, caked on salt. I felt myself dehydrating into George Hamilton.  The sauces are a decent variety.  Have it eastern or western, hot or nothing at all.   I don't see this making it in the long run as the Cotswold crowd may be just slightly too sophisticated for this pleasant but less than wow-ing food."}
{"text":"Nothing \"Improper\" about this place.  Excellent barbeque with a twist, Great atmosphere, perfect portions, good beers , reasonable prices and friendly service make for a nice place to eat and relax. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for BBQ, but wanted to stay in our neighborhood. The food was great. We ordered the Southern Egg Roll (which was got for free as our server recommended that we download the Stealz app for deals at other local restaurants), and for our meals we ordered the 2 Cotswold platters- 1 brisket with mac and cheese and the brussels sprouts, 1 pulled pork with mac and cheese and sweet potato hash. It was a ton of food for a good price. They had 6 sauces to have with our meats, which were all delicious. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and chatty, which was nice since it was one of our first meals out since moving to the area. We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Their brisket is absolutely terrible. Just big strips of tough meat. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel. Food is outstanding. Tons of different things on the menu. All kind of different barbecue sauces to try. Great drink specials.  You will not be disappointed. So good. Always look forward to this place. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Shopping in Cotswold and found this little gem on Yelp. Cool vibe. Friendly staff. Small bar but focuses on local. We only had apps but will be back for dinner for sure! Edamame grilled with garlic and 5 spice was a neat twist"}
{"text":"Service was fine - nothing special just like the food. For us, definitely nothing to write home about. We had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw and chips. They had 5 or 6 different sauces but none of them were great. We probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We first checked out The Improper Pig during the pre-grand opening tasting event and have since been back on a fairly regular basis. I think they have some room to improve but for the most part this is one of our favorite bbq places around town. My personal favorite is the brisket sandwich quite literally drowning in a sea of Korean bbq sauce, Spicy Housin, or the very best sauce... Tongs Thai. Check out the jalapeno cheese grits or the black eyed pea salad for your side and make sure you get an ice cream sandwich before you leave :)"}
{"text":"Took us a while to try this place because we were still kind of bummed about the fact that Mama Fu's was one of our favorite take out places and we were sad to see it go. Went with the kids (12 & 9)  and sat at the bar on a Friday night. Found the service to be good and we order a good spectrum of the menu to really try the food. Started with the fried Kale. It's Kale and its fried and its Kale and let's move on... Next up was the  improper charcuterie. Ribs were a miss (dry). Brisket fair, pulled pork was good, sausage was good but unremarkable. Pimento cheese nothing to write home about. Next up was the chicken nachos for the wife. Sent it back because the pimento cheese was cold and then we were informed that is how they serve it so it wouldn't congeal. Well I guess we just don't know how to eat pimento cheese properly but that dish was not very good. The chicken in it was quite tasty but the cheese.  next to the kids. Son had grilled pimento cheese sandwich took one bite and was done. Daughter had mac and cheese and said it was terrible. Now I know what your going to say that kids can be picky eaters, but we like to eat out and don't mind traveling uptown, Southpark, Noda, Plaza midwood... Wherever there is good food to be had. We eat out 2-3 times a week and have tried a lot of cue joints in town. When your kids put a good dent in a hot box of Krispy Kremes on the way home and the wife still has to feed them when we get home!.. Well we probably won't be back anytime soon.  On the bright side local beer was good."}
{"text":"I got the Cotswold plate with brisket (which costs extra). Their brisket was on the leaner side, which I preferred but my husband wanted fattier pieces. I loved their jalapeno cheese grits. There was just enough jalapeno to give the grits a little kick. I wasn't in love with their creamed corn (the weekly side special), but I'm also not a fan of bell peppers and there was a lot of them in it. (The waitress didn't mention it, or I wouldn't have ordered it.) Their apple cobbler was okay, but it was topped with the smallest scoop of ice cream. Probably won't order it again next time. That's right. Next time. Overall, I enjoyed my meal, and I would come again."}
{"text":"The nachos with pulled pork are out of this world. The bbq has been excellent every time we have been. Service is always prompt and polite."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is a staple for me and my husband. We live close by and I hate cooking and every time we want to go out and not go far Improper Pig is always our go to. I don't eat beef poultry or pork and love all of their options for me. Their jalapeño cheese grits are to die for and I could eat them daily. My husband loves all of their meats and sauces."}
{"text":"Thought it was surprisingly good (my boyfriend thinks \"city people\" doing good BBQ is unlikely, but this would prove him wrong!)  The greens were tender, the sauces were a lot of fun (loved the mustard), the BBQ was lean and tasty.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great cheese grits, comfy big booths, $2 taco Tuesday .... . Never been too busy the times I have been , but fairly quick service and quickly sat ."}
{"text":"I spent more here than I normally would for lunch, but the spicy green beans and jalapeno chese grits were tasty. The pulled chicken was good quality, but a bit dry.  I wanted an additional spicy BBQ sauce beyond Spicy Hoisin -- it's good, but I prefer hoisin for Moo Shu, not 'cue...  I like that they're adding something unique to Cotswold, and I hope they make it."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had.  The Southern Egg Rolls were delicious.  The grits are mind altering - the creamiest, most flavorful. They have a BBQ sauce for every taste and the cocktail menu is extensive (The Lavender Lemonade Martini is my favorite!)  The service is spot on and the ambiance is relaxing and fun.  I make it a point to visit T.I.P. every time I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"First visit here. Very impressed. The bbq sandwich platter is so yummy. Many Asian style sauces to choose from. House slaw is really good as well as the spicy green beans. Not over cooked, which is my pet peeve. Good beer list as well. Very nice atmosphere..good enough for a date."}
{"text":"I eat here probably once a month. Consistently good food, good service, and reasonable prices.   - Pork Plate is my go to - Korean BBQ Salmon is a great dish -Taco Tuesday is a must try! - All of their Asian fusion BBQ dishes have been a hit!   Spicy Green Beans are something I get every time I come here."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a weekday and they were pretty busy so we got seated at a high top communal table. It took a while before any wait staff got to us and we ordered as soon as she came over to give us our drink. We ordered the Southwest egg rolls, Chow bow taco, and Cotswold platter.   -Southwest egg rolls---meh, nothing special. it just tasted like mashed sweet potatoes with bland collared greens -Chow bow taco--- I was really excited to try this bc I love the asian bao buns but the buns were so soggy that I couldnt even eat it. It tasted too dried out and too soggy at the same time! ew!  -Cotswold platter---this was a normal bbq platter. nothing really special. The one thing that was REALLY good was the little pimento cheese you get on the side of the platter! the pimento cheese was delicious!!  We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries ( bc they are my fav and I have to try them everywhere I go) and when it came out I was SO disappointed. It looked like I got the last of the batch or something and they were all burnt and soooo crispy to the point where it tasted like chips. We were going to say something to the waitress but unfortunately she never came back to ask us how the food was so we just left almost the whole plate of burnt fries with out getting eat it :( I can't believe the chef thought it was okay to serve that!! We also thought maybe thats the way they serve their sweet potato fries so we looked around but the sweet potato fries at other tables looked nice and plump and good so it was just our plate of fries that was bad. shame!    Overall we liked how you can try all the different BBQ sauces but that was all. Nothing was special and nothing stood out. I think they can do a better job with their wait staff too. It seemed like they were couple managers on duty too but they were just being food runners and not really being managers ( hence we never saw our server after we received our food and we had to wait a long time before ordering)   Improvement needed!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying i was super excited to try a new BBQ joint especially so close to home. Presentation of the food was very good and place was very clean and kind of a upscale bbq joint look to it and the food came out fast. But it was all down hill after that. With this being my first time i wanted to try the sampler so i got \"The Improper Charcuterie\" which includes pulled pork, Brisket,Ribs,Andouille Sausage,BBQ Chips,Slaw and pimento cheese.   So everyone knows you can judge a BBQ joint by their brisket with that being said i pulled the brisket piece apart and tender but extremely dry, still trying to figure out how you can have a tender piece of meat and be so dry, the flavor of the bark was good. The pulled pork had a nice size portion and good color to it but extremely dry even with the sauces they give. The ribs {2 bones} probably the best part of the meal had good flavor but again over cooked and they left the membrane skin on. The Andouille sausage was ok at best but again over cooked. Not sure if you are getting the theme here??? :) Pimento cheese had some weird after taste to it. Which was disappointing because i absolutely love pimento cheese. They had like 5 BBQ sauces that were Meh and franks hot sauce. I think the pricing was pretty steep as well. $24 for a full rack of ribs, $22 for a 10 oz ribeye and my platter wasn't as bad at $16.   On a bright note the Slaw was good and the BBQ Chips had great flavor but then again basically the two smallest things on the platter.   Verdict: Sorry Improper Pig, I will be driving the extra 5 minutes over to Midwood Smokehouse to get my BBQ and the best brisket in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was skeptical to try the restaurant based on the name and it being a \"bbq\" place, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of options I had. I had a smoked tofu salad which was filling and incredible! The prices are good, portions are big, and service was professional and friendly. We will definitely be back ;)"}
{"text":"Very good... Had the nachos and had pulled pork sandwich with Mac-n-cheese as my side... All good.  Would and will probably go back again"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Tina!  We came late on Tuesday night for the first time.  We chose a comfy little table on the patio and enjoyed the Chow Bao Taco (SPICY-they were super accommodating in giving me a redo with sauce on the side!) and husband enjoyed some insane burger with pork belly.    The jalapeño cheese grits were outstanding as were the sweet potato fries.  There was also a fella who seemed like a manager and he was fun and knowledgeable.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Okay - it's taken a while to do a follow up review because I wanted to try as much from the menu as possible and dine in as well. As life would have it, I've only just recently gotten around to getting in there.  And the results are....  Hmmm. Weeeell...  Here's the deal folks. I LOVE BBQ! I grew up with it. I cook it at home, and I'll pick it almost over anything else that's fast and warm. This, however, does not make me a BBQ expert. That being said, I don't love their BBQ. The menu does have on it the usual BBQ items (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, etc.), but at the risk of upsetting the fragile Cotswold pallate, don't order those items. I love these guys and Cotswold is desperately missing a great BBQ joint, but this is not it. I know in my last review, I asked them not to mess around too much with BBQ, but they didn't listen to me, and mess around they have. And I'm glad they did!  Absolutely ALL of their appetizers are amaaaazing. You MUST try the BBQ Kale Chips, or the Improper Nachos. And I believe I've mentioned Twice-Baked Jalepenos previously. I mean, stuffed with cream cheese and chorizo? Can you find any reason to not want that?!? And their Good Luck Soup, albeit a bit messy to eat, is the perfect ping of pot-licker yumminess. Don't listen to their menu. It's nothing like Brunswick Stew. It IS like absolute tastiness! If there weren't so many other interesting things on the menu, I would just make a meal out of their apps. But if I did that, I would miss out on the tender Shrimp Tacos (although, their tortilla choice needs a bit of adjustment), or their Korean BBQ Salmon, or their Cowboy Rubbed Grilled Ribeye (perfectly cooked). And that would be a crying shame.  And their desserts! I've tried two of their cobblers. It's the kind of dessert that makes you feel guilty eating it, no matter how fit you are. And their Chocolate Cream Pie is the definition of decadence.   So, to sum up, I'm sorry. Truly. But if you want tender, slide off the bone, melt-in-your-mouth BBQ, this may not be the place for you. With my limited knowledge of BBQ preparation, just seems like they need a little more time - both on the grill and as a restaurant - to figure that part out.  But, if you want great service, fun environment, and something new and DELISH, please, please, please drop by the strangely and properly named Improper Pig. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich with chips for delivery using postmates and it was super fast. The chips are delicious and the sandwich is super fulfilling. Postmates delivery fees are usually too pricey, but for the improper pig it is only $4. So convenient. It is my first time trying the improper pig's food, and I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"I would have to say I'm not sure exactly what I expected. The name threw me off a bit, I honestly thought it was nothing but pig. Excited to say, I thought wrong.   The food exceeded my expectations. It came out hot and with a minimum wait time. I had the half smoked chicken with collards and string beans. The string beans are a must try! They had a nice slightly spicy kick to them.  Even the pickled onions were delicious and I'm definitely not an onion fan. Overall for the food, two thumbs up.   Service was great, everyone was welcoming and did a great job at making sure we were taking care of throughout the meal. Not to mention on the spot with bringing out everything we asked for in a timely fashion.   I'm sure to return, next time trying the BBQ Salmon!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always quick and great service. Only reason for 4 starts is the price of the food compared to the portion you receive. Love the brisket and pulled pork. I prefer the brisket but it's usually an upcharge.  The pork rolls are also delicious but they can fill you up and they are also a bit expensive."}
{"text":"A very solid 4.5 stars.  Excellent service, and a very varied menu.  We tried the charcutierie plate, a large enough to share selection of the smoked meats, which were all wonderful with one exception, the brisket could have been a lot leaner . Side orders of Brussels sprouts and  sweet potato waffle fries, were also very good.   There are, I think 8, house made sauces on the table, which were all  excellent, but if you like a bit of spice the hoisin sauce was AMAZING! Not expressly on the menu, we ordered a combination jalapeno/peach margarita, it rocked."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow despite the restaurant being relatively empty. Our waitress disappeared for a while so another waitress had to refill our water, but that wasn't a big deal. She sure did hustle when we asked for the check though! She waited right near our table as we signed our bill/tipped on the credit card slip. Oh well... Anyway, the food was just... blah. I had their BBQ meatloaf that was on special, sweet potatoes & cheese grits. My meatloaf was very a small portion & extremely dry & thin- for $11 at a BBQ joint, I would expect to get a decent serving size. The cheese grits were pretty good but oh my goodness, those sweet potatoes they served me were absolutely awful! The consistency was grainy & it didn't taste like any sweet potatoes I've ever had. Not sure what they mixed in with the potatoes but it tasted more like refried beans that you'd get from a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend also agreed they were pretty bad. Even if I did want to eat it, it was extremely hot & didn't even cool down before we left the restaurant. My boyfriend had a couple different tacos & said they were mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this place since everyone was so nice & it's a cute, cool little place but I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. With so many great places to get BBQ in CLT, I think they need to majorly step their game up!"}
{"text":"Like many people in Charlotte we saw the Improper Pig on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and decided to check them out.  It was only a few minutes from us and in a strip mall, which meant plenty of parking.  The outdoor seating was full on a beautiful day for lunch and we had just a short wait for indoor seating.  Service was friendly and quick.  Everything on the menu sounded good and they noted those items shown on the show, but so many other things were great options.  My wife got the chow boa taco and I got the Cotswold platter with chicken and brisket.  We started with an appetizer of chorizo/cheese stuffed grilled jalepenos.  Tasty!  My food arrived and I was surprised at the large portions.  I selected the jalepenos grits me spicy green beans as sides.  All of the food worked well together.  The chicken was so flavorful I barely added any sauce.  The brisket was a little fatty for my tastes, but was good.  I could have eaten a large bowl of the grits by them self.  The beans had a tasty hoisin sauce.  We came because of the show but we will be coming back often because the food was so good.  Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here one night last week when we were just too tired to cook.  Luckily, they did not dissapoint!  Not only was the food quick and delicious, the service was impeccable!  I can not press enough, just how attentive and helpful the entire staff was at this restaurant.  Every employee who walked by us, offered to help and made sure everything was to our liking.  Service trumps EVERYTHING to me.  Anyone can make great food, but if there isn't good service to deliver that food, nobody wants to eat there!    That being said, we really enjoyed our food!  The nachos we ordered came out super fast and were yummy.  I didn't LOVE them, but they were good.  They had melted pimento cheese and brisket on them...so...enough said!  We both got the Cotswald Platter, getting the pulled pork and mac 'n' cheese!  John also got the Cheesy Jalapeno Grits (think Flying Biscuit's creamy dreamy grits, with a little kick!) and I got the brussel sprouts, hoping that it would help balance out all the not-so-healthy food I was planning to induldge with!  Everything was super tasty here.  We will certainly be back...unless our resolution to lose weight and be healthier (ha) actually goes into effect!"}
{"text":"BBQ place open on Sunday is an awesome find.  When they do it all fresh for sides and meats, your find a trip worthy spot located  in a crazy busy shopping plaza.  Parking is tricky and just drive around till you land a spot.  Amazing is the smoked wings and the grilled giant size ribs, sweet potato waffle fries were hot and crispy.  The  Mac is creamy and yummy premium side.   Then a fun treat is a giant icecream cookies.   Deliciousness everywhere and can't wait to come back!!  Great service."}
{"text":"Ok, we stumbled into this place because some electronics tech we were working with said we could sit ten people. I didn't know it was a ddd reviewed joint.  So I had an Arnold Palmer (very good) and the pork bao sandwich and also a time fish taco.  All was great, I will go back.  They put us outside but turned on the ceiling heaters and everyone but the Florida guy was asking for them to be turned off about 5 minutes later.  We had a great impromptu meeting with great food."}
{"text":"When I went to the IP during opening week, I was less than impressed. Service was not that good and we waited for almost 25 minutes to get our food. I chalked this up to typical opening week jitters and didn't really get upset. Once the food came, it was pretty good although my friend wasn't as impressed. Flash ahead 6 months and I decided to go by myself for a later than usual lunch. This time I ordered the brussel sprouts with my BBQ and I was in food heaven! They do charge you a little extra for the brussel sprouts but they are totally worth it. To be honest, the BBQ is good but nothing special I couldn't get at other area BBQ joints. But I couldn't get those brussel sprouts out of my mind so I brought my same friend back a few weeks later. This time the brussel sprouts were kind of dry but still good. My friend is still not fond of this place but he did like the sprouts. My point is this. I like eating at casual places that offer not only the meats I like, but side dishes you don't often see at other places. And if it sounds like I am rating them based on the brussel sprouts, well I am. They are delicious! And I will be back."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to pork heaven!!!  The whole place is awesome, staff, environment and food.  Had the pulled pork and doused it with \"queen bee\".  It was tender, smoky flavored, perfectfully seasoned pork.  The queen bee sweet tomato based sauce gives Kansas City die hards something to compete with.  Had the Mac and cheese (perfect creamy and cheesy goodness) with the spicy green beans.  The green beans are not spicy but seasoned with something kind of Asian. Good but not great.  I will be back with my family."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. Started with the improper nachos which were incredible! Perfect chips and pimento cheese. They were so good- nothing else I had could live up to them! Since it was my first visit I just wanted to start with the basics- a barbecue platter. The best sauce offering and cole slaw were both Asian inspired- I suspect these are the true strengths of the menu. Other items I had seemed to rely too much on heat spice for flavoring that it was overwhelming. Collards were good, but far too spicy. Pickled onions too strong. More spice in the cornbread. And with vinegar based BBQ sauces - it was all just too many flavors. Sweet potato hash was good, but not what I was expecting- this is more mashed potato than  hashbrowns (It also contained meat ). All the food was fresh, but quick serve meant not everything was terribly warm. Over all good experience and would go back to focus on more of the Asian items. Oh and of course those nachos!"}
{"text":"The place smelled great and I liked the atmosphere but in the end it was just ok. I had the smoked ribs. I like my ribs to fall off the bone. These were really stuck to it and kind of tough. They did have great flavor and I enjoyed the supplies sauces. But from a place with such a great BBQ feel like this I expected better. I'll still try it again sometime. Maybe I just caught them on the wrong day."}
{"text":"I took my sister for a birthday meal and I must say we left as a very happy group! The string beans were a definite hit! I had the tuna which came with an Asian slaw, delicious! The brisket nachos, Wow! The service was attentive and prompt. I will definitely be returning and recommending to friends. Did I mention that every day there is a drink special? Well now you know!"}
{"text":"Went to the IP tonight and the place 1/3 full.   We were seated immediately and given menus.  Waited 20 minutes with no acknowledgement of us sitting there. During our time sitting at the table, 2 wait staff walked past our table 5 or 6 times without looking at us.  We finally walked out without ever ordering and the staff at the front door thanked us for coming in?  Obviously a management problem exist."}
{"text":"Went today on snow day, business was slow to be expected. We had great service!  Had the Improper Nachos & Twice Baked Jalapeños as apps. Great!  Whole family got BBQ, good stuff. The sides were good also. Corn chowder, Lima beans, Mac and cheese.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre and that is all. Went on a weekday 'holiday' where I expected it may be crowded, we were the only folks in the restaurant. The food was 'high end bar food' and the service matched. This was a good place to grab a bite and try something new, but nothing I'll rush back for again with so many options around town. I didn't realize it was a chain, but saw one in Raleigh recently too."}
{"text":"My first time coming here was for a birthday celebration and we all had a good time. I fell in love with the BBQ pulled pork salad. It is amazing!! I live about 30 min away from this restaurant but when I find a place I like um I don't mind the drive. The jalapeño margarita was so delicious. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Improper Pig last night! My wife and I loved the ambience of the restaurant and the bar area is a great place to start your evening. The Thai barbecue sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp.  Yummy Nachos!!!  Great service!  Price is right. What else can i say?"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and this place was a great start! Had the BBQ charcuterie. Full platter of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and sausage. Oh yeah, pimento cheese, home made chips and coleslaw as well. I'm full. Lived in KC for five years and I would put this BBQ up against most. Delicious. Great sauce choices right at the table to sample. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fun!  Kale Chips were interesting.  Asian Slaw tasty.  Pickled Onion fun.  Twice baked Jalapeno Peppers were tasty, not nearly as hot as I'd hoped.  But...the Ribs are to die for.  When adding sauce to your ribs will actually make them worse, you know you've got something good.  Nice job, we will be back.  Oh, and our server rocked, too."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot, like Southern barbecue with a unique twist. The second time I went was even better than the first, they're still pretty new, but I think the place is flowing now. Portions are good, sauces are homemade and you add your own at the table. There are vegetarian options as well as carnivorous ones, so it's a crowd pleaser. I typically leave both full and with a box for later. Prices are reasonable and I've had great service both times. One of my dining partners has food allergies, and they were more than accommodating for him as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We tried the Improper Pig 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of our hairdresser. We were pleasantly surprised as the location in a strip mall belies its amazing Southern dishes. The portions are generous, the waiters/waitresses are well trained and informed and guided us the first time. They got us to come back with their family deal on Sunday nights. Choice of BBQ roasted whole Chicken or pulled pork with generous  portion of 2 sides. I'm not a big beer drinker but they have all types of craft beers and alcohol specials depending on the night of the week.   It's honest southern BBQ gees for families and buddies who want to hang at the bar and watch sports. Definitely, on my keeper list for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place!   The burgers were good.  Definitely a premium burger joint, although there are a couple better places in town.  $12 for a burger with no fries is not cool in my book though.   The service was TERRIBLE.  They messed up a burger and didn't seem to care.  When we asked for lettuce on one of them they brought over a plate with a piece of lettuce that was LITERALLY the size of a baseball card.  They ought to be embarrassed of that!  Even after I said \"you have got to be kidding\" they defended the small piece they brought over.    I'll never go back here again and suggest others don't waste their time or money."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good service. Outdoor dining is OK as it backs up to a parking lot, but really creative food. I've brought several people here and all have loved it."}
{"text":"I went here during Yelp Restaurant week. It was an impulsive decision as I was going to go to Harris Teeter to buy something for dinner. Started off with an onion ring App. They had a great crust to them, had a crunch and the onion didn't fall out like some places. I ordered the improper charcuterie platter. I chose it cause I couldn't decide what meat I wanted so I chose them all. I was disappointed in some of the meat. The Brisket was flavorful but was also quite fatty. The pulled pork was a little bland and needed their BBQ sauces. The ribs were decent. I did enjoy the sausage. It had a great smokey flavor to it but wasn't over powering."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Been wanting to go since it opened, and talked my son out of going to Outback for ribs, to instead try this restaurant. Sorry to say, that Outback has their ribs beat. Dry, smoked, sauce less. Yes, I get that the sauce is on the table and you can add at free will, but why not make a traditional rib with BBQ sauce for those who don't want to try 6 different sauces to find one? Kids will want a BBQ sauce rib that doesn't taste smoky. Some adults might too.  The jalapeño cheese grits were good, the sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese were too. Nothing exceptional, but tasted good. Collards were not my thing.  The service was attentive. Dimmer lighting might be nice. Tables are so close together that something has to help the ambience so lighting would go a long way. With some work on the menu, I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"I came here by accident actually. We ordered the jalapeno appetizer, which was quite small, but good. We also had the korean bbq salmon which was also very good with the spicy green beans on the advice of previous reviews...they were yummy, and the grits. However, that little cornbread muffin they put on the plate could've been left in the kitchen. It really wasn't good. It was dry and not worth the carbs had I consumed it all. The brisket was also good. The brussel sprouts and collard greens were nothing to get excited about either. Not knocking my socks off, but not bad."}
{"text":"Bartender was the BEST! Moscow mule was phenomenal and the pork roll appetizer was our favorite, service was great but my entree (giant bao taco) wasn't my favorite didn't even eat half also jalapeño grits were too hot for me but my husband loved his barbecue sandwich and Mac and cheese. Will be back had lots of great items on their menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first visit last night as part of Yelp's Charlotte restaurant week, so we received 30% off of our visit.  Even without the discount, the food here is well priced and you get plenty for your money. If I were trying to categorize this restaurant, I'd describe it as BBQ fusion -- and it works!  We began our meal with a Southern Egg Roll -- delicious!! The sweetness of the sweet potato with the spiciness of the hot mustard for dipping were perfect.  For the entree, I ordered the Chow Bao Taco -- if it is good enough for Triple D and Guy Fieri, I want to try it!  It did not disappoint. The hoison sauce and Asian slaw change southern barbecue into something else!  My husband ordered the BBQ sandwich with pulled pork.  This is served with an array of sauces brought to the table.  My husband's favorite was the mustard style sauce, while I enjoyed the unique Tong's Thai.    What really sets The Improper Pig apart from other barbecue restaurants is their choice of sides.  I had the jalapeno grits -- creamy, mild, and delicious.  My husband ordered the spicy green beans -- which lean a little more to sweet than spicy, but were one of the highlights of the meal -- cooked perfectly crisp tender.  The Improper Pig also has nightly drink specials.  On Tuesdays, you can get half off of select wine by the glass and $5 margaritas.  I tried the Jalapeno Margarita and was not disappointed.    Service was on point as our server Jamie was helpful in suggesting things to try and made sure that we had everything we needed during the meal.  A manager or owner also checked in on us at one point.  This is a casual restaurant, so no need to get dressed up.  The whole family can come.  We will definitely be back to enjoy this local gem!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the aroma of barbecue hits you and makes you even hungrier! That being said come hungry because the burgers are huge!  They have several different sauces available for those with different preferences. Also lot of sides to choose from; I had the sweet potato fries and they were great!   They have drink specials everyday of the week which is something you don't find everywhere, today I had the $4 Mimosa.  There's so much to choose from on the menu so I'll definitely be returning to try it all!"}
{"text":"A little slice of heaven!!! Stopped by for my first visit today and was completely blown away. The atmosphere and decor are nice, service by Brittany was stellar and then my food came. The nachos were amazing and a huge portion. I ordered the cotswald platter with chicken and pork for lunch. Both meats were tender and juicy (did find a bone in my chicken though) and the sauces are all delicious. The mac and cheese was a definite highlight. It was so good and tasted like my grandma's recipe. The house slaw was good. Kinda bland, but, still very good quality. After a rough week, this was perfection for a comfort food meal and i will definitely be back and will bring friends and family. I question why this place wasn't packed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Overall a fairly good dining experience. The BBQ was tasty and the sides were delicious. Service was a little slow considering the restaurant was only half full, and prices were a little high, especially on the appetizers. One of the best things about the whole meal was the stuffed jalapeños but it was only 4 small little pieces for $6 or $7 and it left me wanting more, however, for that price I had to pass. Bartender was also a little inexperienced (you don't shake a Manhattan) and you don't upcharge a $4 special drink to $10 because you put it over ice and add a splash of vermouth.  I will definitely come back in a couple months and try this place again. Hopefully by then they've worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"The Improper Pig is making Cotswold great again! Well, Cotswold Village has never lost its greatness but The Improper Pig makes it even greater! This is one of those joints where every item on the menu could be used as a currency. Absolutely delicious!   We had a party of 7, three of which were children ages 10 and under. The Improper Pig's greatness didn't stop at the quality of food. It continues on to their quality of service. Our server was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The restaurant was clean and they make you feel welcomed.   My only complaint is that their food is too great. I wanted to try everything on the menu. Some people make to-do lists. I have to-eat lists and my list just got a little longer. Great work!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cute interior, delicious food, and clean kitchen!  Close to our house and our new favorite \"go to\" spot.  Check it out next time you're in Cotswold or make the drive just for this gem!!!"}
{"text":"Compared to the other BBQ places around Charlotte, this place is pretty average.  I'd opt for Mac's or Midwood Smokehouse before coming back."}
{"text":"This is really a neat spot to come and enjoy a relaxing and delicious lunch! As soon as my friends and I walked in, we were greeted and seated. Good for families, at least during lunch time, or to come by yourself. They have a bar area, booths, and some high tables. The kitchen area is visible and it looks very clean. Our food came very quickly, and our server was very attentive of us. The general manager also came to check on us a few times. Definitely would recommend and come back!  P.S. Try the orengade!   Quality of food - 5/5 Cleanliness - 5/5 Ambience - 5/5 very relaxing Service - 5/5"}
{"text":"Completely delicious! I have never ha a single bad thing at The Pig, nor have I ever experienced bad service! The drinks are delicious, and always enjoy a place that carries local craft brews! The Improper Pig is definitely not your average BBQ place if that's what you're looking for, they have their own twist and some amazing sauces to go with!"}
{"text":"So many things that are delicious here!! For appetizers the Twice Baked Jalapeños and Korean BBQ wings are spicy but absolutely amazing! The wings are saucy and meaty and cream cheese and chorizo is the perfect mixture with the spice of the jalapeños! If you like egg rolls and you like pulled pork, you will love the Pork Roll. The Improper Charcuterie has all the meats and the pimento cheese with the chips is a wonderful side. The Spicy Green Beans were a great add-on! The sauces were tasty and the Tong's Thai was a nice twist with the pulled pork. Though spicy, the Jalapeño Cheese Grits were amazing and I don't eat grits... EVER! The Cotswold Burger was delicious, however, the bun is very thin and got soggy with the pork and slaw on top, and I will avoid the sweet potatoes hash next time as there is a strong vinegar taste. Overall, was an amazing experience with great service and wonderful food in a very family friendly environment!"}
{"text":"Food is great, chill atmosphere. Lots of options even for those who are vegan/vegetarian."}
{"text":"I Love taco Tuesday, and am always on the hunt for the best bang for your buck. Improper pig is defiantly on the top if the list. You can chose from five tacos( which we of course tried them all) and they were all delicious. Couldn't even pick a favorite, just go ahead and get them all!  We also had the improper nachos as an appetizer. The pimento cheese with the salt and vinegar chips was the proper combination of flavor.  Now, I am not a desert person, probable ordered desert less than 5 times in my life. However, the cobbler was calling my name. It was blueberry for this month so we decided to give it a try. Tasted like grandma was In the back whipping it up. It was nice and hot with some yummy vanilla ice cream. Atmosphere was nice in a good location. Can't wait to go back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It used to be Mama Fu's an Asian fusion franchise. I worked there for almost 10 years. It's the same owner and a lot of same staff. The owner is very family oriented and goes above and beyond for his employees. The improper pig has amazing food and I always get excellent customer service"}
{"text":"Manager was unwilling to allow the server to let me do ala cart items.  All I wanted was pulled pork and a side of corn bread so I just had an order of corn bread while my friends ate.   The server was completely embarrassed and we could sense the manGer was being difficult for her to communicate with.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all, don't know how this ended up on DDD. Food wasn't worth the prices and the taste wasnt there, won't be back. The service was great we had. Friday night at 9 pm, dead in there, guess that tells the story for a place that \"should\" be famous for being on tv. Also got a hamburger, what a rip off, and no fries? Who only wants sweet potato fries?!"}
{"text":"First time here today and it was great!  Portions were big and bbq was wonderful.  I loved the smokey flavor. Service was fast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gourmet barbecue. Food is excellent with hefty portions and a variety of bbq sauce options. The menu looks very interesting (I will certainly come back to try some more stuff) Service was great, the staff was attentive, polite, and curteous. Great beer selection (a must with bbq). Prices were reasonable. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We stopped in with the kids on a Wednesday night. Timely attentive service and the food came out super quick. Spicy green beans, jalapeño cheese grits, apple sauce - all delicious. I'm an eastern NC barbecue fan at heart, but this was well made with good smoke flavor and nice bark mixed in. Six sauces to choose from, most of which I liked. Even my 7 year old gobbled up the slider, slaw and all. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I'm not certain this will be on my radar to revisit, but it was an overall good experience. First off the staff is incredibly friendly and prompt. Everything on the menu sounded great and the sides were divided by price. Just so you know if you order an item that \"comes with sides\" that what it really means that is comes with the $3 sides not the $4 sides. They are very up front about it which I can appreciate, but seems a bit extreme considering their prices are already kind of up there. Don't go by the menu online as those prices are no longer valid. They've raised the prices by a good $2-3. I ended up getting the Cotswald plate with pulled pork, mac and cheese, and spicy green beans. My aunt got the ribs with Mac and cheese and potato hash. First things first, the pulled pork was good but it came out cold. Like seriously cold. I didn't send it back so Or mention it because I was in a hurry but I was disappointed. They have a million sauces you can try. I think the vinegar based sauce was the best one for the pork. The waitress said the Mac and cheese was awesome, but I only thought it was okay, but the spicy green beans were yummy (albeit not spicy). I expected to love the sweet potato hash but I wasn't impressed. One thing I was impressed with though were the chairs... I know a weird thing to bring up, but they were sooo comfortable!!"}
{"text":"Kale chips had a definite bbq flavor.  I added the Mary's BBQ sauce.  On the initial visit, had the pulled pork sandwich w/chips & my dining companion had the ribs & sweet potato fries.  Both meats were extremely dry.  There was a ton of slaw as garnish on the pulled pork which would make it difficult to eat by putting the top & bottom buns together.  I ate the sandwich as 2 parts.  There are 6 different sauces on the table to allow the consumer to decide how much sauce & what kind should season their sandwich.  It just didn't help the ribs or the pulled pork become any less dry.  Our 2nd visit was great timing on a Sat right before it seems all the kids soccer games let out.  I had the shrimp tacos w/the jalapeno cheese grits & my significant other one of the specials of the day - the bellybuster sandwich which was a combination of pork & hamburger w/chips.  The shrimp was hard to locate under all the Asian slaw.  It felt like a salad w/a bbq sauce that had a real kick.  The jalapeno cheese grits were tasty w/the right amount of heat from the jalapenos for a person that doesn't like spice.   The Bellybuster went half eaten not because of the size - more so again somehow it was a bit on the dry side.  The spicy green beans were thoroughly enjoyed.  For dessert, decided to give a  cobbler a go.  This is not the crumbly type of cobbler but a small round cake w/no taste sandwiched between a single scoop of vanilla ice cream & berries.  it is served in a cast iron skillet.  Ditch the cake & serve the berries w/2 scoops of ice cream & we would've been much happier campers.  Overall both experiences were ok.  The chips are supposed to be salt/vinegar.  They don't have a discernible salt & vinegar taste.  It is hard to tell if they are made in house.  The chips seem like they could come from a bag.  Suggestion would be to make them similar to the kale chips & have the option of the salt/vinegar as well.  The menu has a wide selection for Vegetarians or Gluten dietary needs.  Both are clearly marked."}

{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 3.65 Stars  I feel kind of generous giving The Improper Pig 4 stars....for the reasons I'm about to share with you. But overall, I had a GREAT time with Marco F and Allyson D, and we all enjoyed the food and drinks!  I ordered the Double Baked Jalapenos with cream cheese and chorizo filling. Now these were REALLY great! Basically one bite wonders....  Well I wanted to sample what this restaurant is all about, so I got the Improper Charcuterie, which was basically pulled pork, brisket, ribs, andouille, pimento cheese, slaw, and pickled onions. Let's go over one by one....  Pulled pork: Yummy goodness! Had to be pork shoulder as it was moist and tender. Brisket: Kind of dry, but had good flavor. Ribs: Average at best. Andouille: Reminded me more of a Portugese Linguica than an Andouille, but was OK. Their pimento cheese was REALLY good! Went great with their delicious homemade chips. Slaw wasn't bad at all, and the pickled onions provided a refreshing palate clense after all that meat!  Sauces were interesting. See my picture of the various sauces offered. The two I did NOT care for were the mustard and the Eastern NC vinegar. Just not my thing. The Hoisin was really good, but I felt that it was out of place given the food I was eating. I tried it on my ribs but I just didn't think it went. My buddy Marco loved it though. To each his own.....But I did use the Queen Bee more than any other sauce as this was a classic Sweet (Georgia-style) BBQ sauce that went well with all the meats I had on my plate. Definitely my fave of the night!  Service was decent, but our waitress did seem to disappear for long stretches....hummmm.   Smaller than usual selection of beers on tap...I'd have liked to see more Charlotte and/or NC beers offered. What's with the IPAs? How about more strong ales and Porter/Stouts?  Overall I did enjoy The Improper Pig. I wasn't invited to the Yelp Elite event here so that's why I wanted to check this out tonight. They do sell your favorite meats by the pound, FYI."}
{"text":"Was here on Sunday. Place was packed and did not desire to sit out in the patio with all the heat and humidity. We sat in the bar area and right in front of Vincent who was prepping the pulled pork and on the grill.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar which was a lot of fun creating your own drink. Sprinkled with Crispy Bacon...  Cornbread Muffins- Cute bite size with a packed punch (Jalapeno). That is what stood out and the black-eyed peas on the side.  We both ordered the Sliced Beef Brisket & House Slaw with Chips. Brisket was so tasty and juicy that I tackled the brisket and left the buns. Thinly slice potato chip and playing with all the 6 different sauces. The Spicy Green Beans- must order so crunchy and fresh.  Relaxing Sunday brunch/lunch here. Will be back again for sure.  Our waitress was Autumn, informed us to sign up with SteelZ app on mobile phone and get a Free Southern Egg Roll-The filling very unique with sweet potato and collard greens.   Would have not known about this restaurant if it were not for a Yelp event that I attended in the past."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance!  The beef brisket plate with spicy green beans and mac & cheese was fantastic, especially complemented by the spicy hoisin sauce.  A MUST try!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I will say that I had hoped after reading some great reviews but it was very mediocre. There's so much going that you don't really get sense of their food. Nacho chips were bland. The ahi tuna had no flavor and was cut extra thick and was hard to chew. My pork belly bun wasn't bad just could've used more sauce. Green beans were probably the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I would call this \"eccentric BBQ.\"  This place is a nice hole in the wall.  Environment is nice.  It has a small bar.   The menu is pretty good.  Service and prices were fine.  I ordered BBQ pork sandwich, cheese grits and coleslaw.   Everything was ok.  I've had worse,  but I've had better too.  If you are in the neighborhood, and looking for a place to grab a bite with a friend, you should consider it."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good. Can't believe this was our first time here. Also our waiter was beyond helpful and friendly. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Well If you like chopped barbecue that tasted like lemon pepper tuna in a bag you will love it. Eewwwwww sick!!!!"}
{"text":"So I want to apologize for not posting pictures. As soon as the food came out, I was so impressed and excited to dig in.  First, their small draft list consists of all local brews and it sounds like they constantly rotate out. I had the devil's britches and old meck's smoked Amber. My friend had the Mary's margarita that I tried and you can tell it's made with all fresh ingredients. Second, the service was incredible! Simone read our table so well. We were there to kill some time and not in any sort of hurry. She helped us with the menu and all of her recommendations were perfect. We never felt rush and we never felt like a burden. Also, she is adorable and super sweet. Kudos for the beaming smile! Finally, the food. AMAZING! We started with the nachos with shaved chicken. House made salt and vinegar chips with house made pimento and super tender and smoked chicken. We took this opportunity to sample all the sauces which were great.  As we were getting full we began thinking the we two ladies would not be able to consume two entrees. Simmone to the rescue. She suggested we share a platter. We split the pulled pork platter with two sides. We had the amazing Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding, the sprouts beat the Mac and that's not a dis on the pasta.  All and all, we had a fantastic Saturday lunch! So glad we chose this spot with so many places in the area."}
{"text":"What a cute place and worth the drive. I tried it off of a whim from discount app. I had the meat tray so that I could try all that they had. Everything was great except the ribs and my second piece of brisket.   The tray came out with pulled pork, brisket,  sausage, ribs, coleslaw, pimento cheese and cornbread. It was so much food that I couldn't finish it but a great value for 20.00.   Now let's talk cocktails...i had the SMASH and GRAB which was amazing made with Larceny bourbon. Defiantly hit the spot.   Their cobbler of the month was a strawberry cobbler which was so yummy and topped with icecream. The crust was really good and the strawberries were fresh and plump. And to round everything out the service waa great and quick."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place from my co-worker. Today I decided to go. It's really not a big restaurant (which is a plus for me). The have a bar, outside eating area. Also there are TV on the wall watch was playing ESPN and news. Lucky me I want on taco Tuesday($2 per taco) and when I said my tacos where sooooo delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch in the patio area - shrimp tacos with Asian slaw - they were delicious!  The sweet potato hash, meh. The sweet potato waffle fries - awesome.  Patio was comfortable, the server kept us with us, and my glass was never empty, so life was good!"}
{"text":"The service was great and fast. The atmosphere is relaxing and fun. I ordered the barbecue pork sandwich with Queen Bee sauce with coleslaw and sweet potato fries and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Start off with the Improper Nachos and get a cole slaw on your sandwich."}
{"text":"Since this was my first visit to The Improper Pig, I wanted to do it right and order something decidedly fusion-y. I went with the pulled chicken chow bao taco which was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and is basically a BBQ sandwich in a steamed bao bun with Asian slaw and spicy hoisin (this was a little too spicy for my tastes but was balanced by adding one of the sweeter sauces on the table). The menu also conveniently notes which items are vegan, gluten free and vegetarian - surprising a lot for a BBQ place. The veggie options looked so good that I almost went with the \"no pig\" grilled portobello sandwich. Next time. We sat on the outside patio and I will say that the ambience was not great. You're overlooking a strip mall parking lot. And we had to move away from the edge of the patio because the wind shifted and brought with it a sewery smell. But other than that, a great lunch."}
{"text":"I visited this place with a group of friends about an hour before it closed on a Thursday night.  My friends both had a pulled porlk sandwhiches and I had the barbecue salad with pulled pork.  The wiat staff was very friendly and the food not only tasted extremely yummy but was fast, well prepared and hot.  A quick but pleasant visit. I will definitley visit this location as their menua has an interesting variety and also has a great beer selection."}
{"text":"OK I felt the pressure to revise my review. I was way to harsh! It's not the place for BBQ. It's just not. The atmosphere is nice the sides are mostly creative and pleasing to the pallet. But being around BBQ my entire life and all types including Memphis and Dallas, I can say that every time someone tries to fancy up BBQ I am disappointed. Good Try but I am not buying. Wonder what these guys could do with a steak? With all those creative juices flowing Now I bet they could do that well!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I will definitely come back! I love all the BBQ sauces and the green beans are to die for. Not cooked the traditional southern way, but wow...delish!"}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant. The collard greens were amazing! The only issue is that the waitress forgot EVERYTHING. She was a sweetheart but I had to remind her too many times about things and the place was not full."}
{"text":"Another lovely meal!! My second time here, the added details to the presentation of the food A+ in my book. The food is great, from the chicken fried rice, spicy green beans and today the chicken wings.  Excellent!!!!   A lovely place to try if your looking for something different!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what Improper Pig is trying to be, but it feels like it's trying too hard. The \"little bit of this and that\" menu concept has been on the rise in the restaurant industry. It confuses me. A restaurant is not a food court. If you're looking for \"hip\" BBQ/tacos/Asian, okay fine. IP has got you covered. And the food is pretty good. Props to the house BBQ sauce and collards. That said, I don't feel compelled to return. If I was in Cotswold already and hungry, sure. But my BBQ lust goes to Midwood Smokehouse and the tiny gem Peace N Hominy in Belmont."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and the Bloody Mary wasn't half bad. Their pork and sauces are better than Midwood, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Less than enamored by their bbq. The pulled pork had an off-tasting flavor, and the ribs and Mac n cheese both were over cooked. Their only redeeming quality was an excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"I expected more from Improper Pig.I went here one day for lunch and did not think it was that great at all.I ordered the black eyed peas salad which the waitor told me was good and it was totally disgusting.I changed it for the spicy green beans which weren't all that great,but better than the previous side.My smoked chicken needed more seasoning and the sauce did not make it any better.I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"The food was very good! I started with the corn bread with black eyed peas. Well the cast iron pan it came in was hot but the little corn bread muffins were not and they weren't fresh.   A bit too crumbly. The peas were cold and were too much of a clash for me. Then I tried the ban bao taco and was very happy I did. The sauce on the brisket was delicious with a little bit of bite to it. The mac and cheese was ok, nothing special. Cheesy and creamy. Unfortunately the service was not good. I was never offered a refill on my Diet Pepsi and we had to ask for more water. Overall the food was good but the service needs help. I think once DDD went there they now don't care as much about the service because people will go just because Guy did."}
{"text":"After meaning to stop into this place much sooner, recently got the chance to try the Improper Pig. Had the Southern Eggroll, which was only OK (thought the choice to build it around the sweet potato hash was odd)...luckily, everything was uphill from there. The meats (pulled pork + pork ribs) were great, and definitely aided by the variety of sauces available (my fav was the spicy, with the Queen Bee a close 2nd). But the real test was the sides, and they passed with flying colors. The jalapeño cheese grits were awesome, and the mac-n-cheese was on point. Tried my wife's collard greens as well - tasty, if a little too vinegar-y. Overall, absolutely enjoyed my meal. My only complaints were the so-so appetizer and the lack of wet naps (a very obvious + disappointing ommission, though). Other than that, this place hit all the marks for an authentic BBQ joint - right down to the annoying fly bothering me up under the table."}
{"text":"We've been to the Improper Pig twice: once on a Friday evening: busy, but good service. Food was very good. Tried two apps: sweet potato & collard egg rolls, and the soup. Both were good. Egg rolls needed seasoning with sauce from table though. Had beef brisket (more $) with roasted brussel sprouts and jalapeno cheese grits - all very tasty. Good variety of sauces on table to choose from. Only negative: water tasted metallic.  Second visit: Sunday lunch with three adults and one toddler. Food good again, crowded again and good service again. Collards - wonderful. Brisket on one meal was fatty. Not the case on previous visit. For $4 more - it should be perfect. Bloody Mary bar looked intriguing. Didn't try it though. Kids mac n cheese - creamy but not terribly cheesy looking. Sweet potato fries were good. Brought in our own applesauce & kids' drink."}
{"text":"First impressions where pretty decent! Pork was very good... Brussel sprouts were tasty...   sauces were the only mhhhh... on the meal! We'll be returning!"}
{"text":"My mother and I ordered the Belly Burgers and they came with homemade chips. They were burned so we had to ask for a replacement.  The lettuce wraps were very good. I'll definitely come back but probably won't order the chips again."}
{"text":"First stamp on my EatWorkPlay Charlotte food passport! My second visit to Improper Pig did not disappoint my out of town guests and the runaway favorite was their chao bao taco with green beans. Seriously, don't even consider getting anything else, just order it and go home happy.  We went for lunch on a random Monday and had the entire patio to ourselves, which was perfect for an 18-month old to wander around and not get into trouble. Our waiter could not have been more friendly and accommodating, so five stars for service.  While Cotswold may not come to mind as a Charlotte food destination hotspot, Improper Pig helped put the Queen City on the map with their DDD feature. There are plenty of options for BBQ around, including my favorites Midwood Smokehouse and City Barbeque, but Improper Pig can scratch a different itch with Asian flavors. Easy to recommend and nice to get to a neighborhood that I don't normally frequent."}
{"text":"Gave me and my girlfriend stomach problems. Was in and out of the bathroom all night."}
{"text":"The staff was nice! But, Really disappointed in the $5 burger!!! The burger was greasy but dry I hope because they left the slaw off!! Either way not impressed!!!! I was looking for flavor but I found it just greasy and frozen patty texture!!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing The Improper Pig isn't close to my house because I'd have a haaaard time not going all the time if it were. The fella and I ventured over on a Wednesday night around 8:00, and we were immediately greeted by a super nice, chatty host. He seated us, and our waitress appeared just a few minutes later.  It took me forever to decide what I wanted because everything looked so good! I finally landed on the Chow Bao Taco with pulled pork and a side of Brussels sprouts. The taco came in a steamed bao bun, which I've never had before, and it was doughy but delicious and light. The pulled pork was so fresh, too! I could've eaten 3 more of them. The sprouts were okay, but nothing to write home about.  The fella went with the pulled pork & slaw sandwich (which he figured was like Mac's Lil Pig) and a side of spicy green beans. He said the beans were good but the sandwich beats Mac's... a bold statement for the fella.   The atmosphere was pretty cool with a comfy wooden/aluminum vibe, there was easy parking in the Costwold lot, and they had fair prices. The beer selection was just okay, but the bourbon list was pretty awesome (except there weren't prices on those... hmmm)."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst burgers I have ever had here.  It was burned and not great meat to begin with."}
{"text":"The smoked tofu was awesome.  The improper nachos appetizer was homemade potato chips with lots of BBQ on top. We liked all 5 BBQ sauces on the table.  Our waiter was very nice.  We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waitress was extremely nice, decent drink specials. Down from Boston and went to a different BBQ spot daily. Brisket is sitting in an oven all day and comes out dryer than the Sahara and the pulled pork may have been made days earlier. Absolutely wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. It's the second time we've eaten here. The first experience was OK, but nothing particularly noteworthy. So, I wanted to make another visit before reviewing. Last night's dinner was very good... Not quite a 5, but close.  For apps, our party shared onion rings, the stuffed jalapenos, and edamame. The onion rings were so crispy and not a bit greasy, but needed a bit of salt and pepper. The ranch dressing on the side was really creamy. The stuffed jalapenos are really good. They're not breaded and fried, so they have a much fresher flavor. The only downside is the portion is too small. The edamame was fine, but again a small portion.  For my meal, I had pulled pork, black eyed pea salad, and jalapeno grits. All were excellent. The pork was moist and flavorful. The grits were creamy, bordering on decadent. And the black eyed pea salad was so fresh and the peas had just the right amount of bite to them. Everyone else in my party of 7 really enjoyed their meals, too.   The prices are on the high side for the amount of food you get. If you are looking for Southern BBQ that's good but cheap, this isn't the place. That's because the atmosphere is much nicer than a BBQ joint. This place is a bit more refined, with appetizers, a full bar, and no rednecks. Overall the food is good and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The brisket was tasty, little bit fatty but overall good. Loved all the different sauces you can try with it. Would come back again. Maybe have the brisket on a sandwich instead by itself."}
{"text":"WARNING: if you're a bbq purist especially of the NC variety do not come here only to complain that is not what you receive.  The name says it all, it is improper unconventional bbq and totally awesome! The ambiance is modern casual, neat decor, and pleasant vibe.  As soon as you walk up you can smell that wood burning smoker which is the only way to legitimize yourself as a good BBQ spot in my eyes. They also had a really good draft selection with an emphasis on local brews which is always worth bonus points with me!  Pricing for the brews was avg to pricey depending on the brew, and the bar looked like a neat area to grab a brew and some apps after work.  To find your first unconventional aspect all you have to do is read the apps menu, you'll find edamame and bbq kale chips, first clue purists! But rest assured I ordered both and both exceeded my expectations.  Kale chips well seasoned and had a little kick of spice at the end, it was actually to spicy for my wife but she is kind of a baby in regards to heat.  For dinner I ordered the pulled pork which I typically will use as a basis for conclusion on a BBQ spot, but I did temper expectations as I said the improper aspect was expected to come into play.  Having said, it was awesome, traditional flavor of unsauced meats, moist succulent, light smoke flavor, good mix of bark.  I got the collards and Brussel sprouts as my side, both were very good but nothing to go out of the way to elaborate, if you like those things you'll like these.  I really liked the cornbread \"cookie\" that it came with, it wasn't huge but stop being a gluttonous douche, the portion size of food is fair enough.  My wife got the pulled chicken which was also very good and an act side of Mac and cheese and a very good sweet potato hash.  The choice of sauces is very good they have the normal western/eastern NC sauces as well as SC mustard.  The best I thought carried heavy Asian influence with a spicy hoisin and a sweet chili sauce.  If you really like heat ask for a side of inferno, my server let me in on this secret!  It will not be found on the tables and be cautious it is a slow deep burn, non inedible but you don't need much!   I also really enjoyed the \"plating\" of the food served on metal trays and a side of pickled slaw I'm guessing, I really liked flavor contrast of the pickled slaw with the meat.   I will be back soon with more to report (I definitely have my eye on those improper nachos) but in the meantime do your tummy a flavor and get there now!"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of hype around Improper Pig, so I had to go and try it out. With that said, I'm not sure what all the hype is about. The BBQ is ok, I've had much better in Charlotte. The grits were great, I really liked them. The baked beans weren't good at all. I can't even put my finger on what was wrong with it but it wasn't tasty at all. My husband had the sweet potato hash and I thought that was very good, he didn't like it. The prices are good there and the beer selection is good. I will go back again and try something different, but as a BBQ there are better places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We will be back!  The young lady at the front Door, Keaton our Server and Gavin the GM were amazingly happy and helpful.  Keaton knows the product and with a couple of 4 tops and one 6 top, attention never waned, Awesome for a young guy, we missed service like this consistently at places that are supposed to be much nicer (Village Inn & Cowfish) and service fell apart..  The food was flavorful w/o the sauces but the sauces brought it to another level. We finished off with the cobbler which was Black and Blue Cobbler.   All in All a very pleasurable experience and in the words of the famous Gen. MacArthur \"We Shall Return\"  Challenge Gavin on the music playing..He pulled TOM TOM CLUB! LOL"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out The Improper Pig for a while and was excited to see that they were one of the restaurants for Yelps Restaurant Week.  From the time you walk in you know this is a bbq joint. The aroma of smoked meat feels the atmosphere.  I got the smoked chicken wings and the southwest chopped salad with pulled chicken. Both were incredible and the salad was pretty filling. Make sure you try the collard greens which are vegetarian but taste like they were cooked by someone's grandma!  They have two locations one in Charlotte and one in Fort Mill hope they will put one in the university or Concord area soon! They have also been featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives for those who watch the show. They have drink specials every day. I went on a Saturday and the special was was margaritas. The peach margarita was really good and definitely would order it again. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall I was very pleased with my decision on choosing the Improper Pig for lunch on the last day of the Yelp Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent prices, wonderful people and an odd location. Two stars means meh.  The kale chips also made me nauseous for a day and a half after eating them. No idea why."}
{"text":"I meet a friend here any time we decide to have lunch (it's location is right in the middle between our workplaces). He and I never hesitate to decide where to eat. The food is great. My favorite things to get are the twice baked jalapeños, pulled chicken, and the brisket tacos. I always get sweet potato fries as my side. I'm sure all of the other food here is good too. The service is great and everyone is friendly. 5 stars from me"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, nice bartenders.    I keep going back just to get take out orders of Spicy Green beans.  I guess I should really should learn how to make them myself so I don't have to go get take out to pair with my home cooked dinners.  Go try them!   -Alan D."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but place is a rip off. Portions are embarrassing. Just left their fans had lunch and I'm starving.  Spent $14 for nothing."}
{"text":"I was not expecting it to be so good. I wasn't. Being that I take a lot of lunch brakes in this area, and the other stores and restaurants around this one are menial to say the least, I was expecting mediocre. BUT, it was SOOOO good. I had the Bahn Mi and my mouth was happily on fire!! The seasoning and taste to that sandwich were perfect. The meat was marinated and so tender! Absolutely a must try. Service is service and our waiter that day was on point. Parking is kind of weird especially during lunch hour, but don't ever let that stop you."}
{"text":"I had a couple tacos that were very good, the onion rings were amazing and the Brussel sprouts OMG to die for.  We also had the stuffed jalapeno peppers, you better like spicy but they are also veryyy tasty.  we are fan and will be back"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. The meats were tasty. The nachos are a meal on their own and the smoked chicken works well with it. The charcuterie is great for a sampler to share as well. A little $$ but well worth it and the service was great."}
{"text":"So good! Definitely try it! I love the fusion of BBQ and Asian food. We got the sweet potato egg rolls the pork eggs rolls the pork nachos, I got the side dish, and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich. First of all I love the idea of a side dish plate. It was you pick 4 sides and it comes with cornbread. Sometimes that's all I want when I go to BBQ places, so nice touch! the staff was nice, and the atmosphere was cool. Plenty of parking. Definitely try. Plus if your a fan of triple D is a cool stop"}
{"text":"Way back in the day I came to a Yelp event for their grand opening - it was awesome - they really blew the roof off with that party! Having a BBQ flashback now...  Since then, I've eaten here twice and once at the Oinker (their food truck). Why no review? Old age maybe? Well it's time I sang their praises, and sing them I will.  The entire staff here is about enjoyment - they want you to enjoy everything and spread the love; if something's not right, they make it right. They've also done such a good job with decorating that you totally forget you're in a strip mall when you go inside.  I had one of the amazing Mango Margarita specials - Mason jar sized, cold, smooth, heavenly, fruity and \"sneak up on you\" strong!  I tackled the Cotswald Plate - your choice of meat and two sides. The only difference between this and the platter is an additional meat. The presentation is a work of art. The tray and parchment paper are the canvas and all that smoky meaty goodness is the paint. The BBQ here is top notch and the sides, oh, the sides. The collards and baked beans were out of this world. These guys know how to season things so well you'll never touch a salt or pepper shaker. The beet salad had a really nice contrast between the peppery flavor of the arugula and the roasted earthiness of the beets and squash. Add some pumpkin seeds and Dijon vinaigrette and it's magical.  BTW did you know Mr. Fieri shot a DDD episode here? He sure did! I wonder if he fantasizes about smoked and grilled meat as much as I do???"}
{"text":"Such great food, and the cocktails are amazing. Really attentive waitstaff is excellent at keeping your glass filled.   Good came out fast and hot."}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelmed. I wanted to like this place so bad because it was on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. Guy Fieri lied!"}
{"text":"Great barbeque, service, drinks, and ambience. Our server, Michelle, was welcoming and had excellent suggestions for drinks and entrée options.  We sat in the outside area, which was perfect for a calm and warm evening. While there was a good crowd, the staff was attentive and the nose level was perfect for a chat with my dining companion. Highly recommend this restaurant for top notch BBQ, drinks, and attractive, clean décor."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss ,today was TOTAL MISS. We stopped for lunch and had the usual crowd of people. The hostess sat us and 25 min later still nothing,the hostess acknowledged us once but would never make eye contact again. The server or should I say lack of them never appeared , this is not the first time it has happened . I'm sorry but like your food ,but service is what kills this place every time."}
{"text":"Went back here today and brought my mother-in-law and an already great history here was made better by increased portion sizes, amazing customer service (our server was so on the ball, helpful and happy and the manager came to check in on us) and trying the nachos appetizer. A lot of times, a restaurant's quality will go down over time, but Improper Pig just keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"I recently dined here for lunch and dinner. For lunch, I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it was delicious! Service was very good and my food came out quickly.   My dinner experience was also great. I ordered the bbq chicken plate with 2 sides. I got the sweet potato hash and crowder peas. The sweet potato hash was savory which I truly enjoyed. Sweet potatoes don't always have to be super sweet like a dessert. The crowded peas were very hard but when I mentioned it to someone they replaced it immediately. I ended up with the green beans which were pretty much the best I've ever eaten. Now I'm craving them for breakfast the next day. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch because of the great reviews. Guess we just had a bad meal. It was mediocre. Pork was overdone and dry. Had to load up on sauce to make it good. Service was good. Thought it was overpriced for quality though. Macs and Jim/nicks is definitely better."}
{"text":"This BBQ joint serves up one of the most eclectic menus in Charlotte, with a mix of Southern and Asian influences. Egg rolls, nachos and pulled pork, all on the same menu? Yep. But the 'Que is tasty and succulent, served up with a solid selection of craft brews and sides. They might rate higher if they stuck to their knitting, but every once in a while, it pays to be a little different."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This big is improper. You must have BBQ when you're in the Carolinas. Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too packed. We were seated at a high top table and I started off with a sweet tea. I went with the pulled pork sandwich which is served with your choice of side. Went with the mac and cheese.  The nice thing about The Improper Pig is they have about six BBQ sauces for you to choose from: a ketchup-based BBQ, a vinegar-based one, a Thai one, and several other choices. I'm all about variety and several of the sauces are excellent. On the downside, you have to squirt the sauce on your plate and sauces start intermingling. It would be nice if they had individual containers. The BBQ was a bit dry but still was good when doused in sauce. The mac and cheese was average. I did try my buddies sweet potato fries and that's the way to to go. Waffle sweet potato fries. That is a winning side in my book."}
{"text":"This is such a neighborhood, go-to-when-we-don't- feel-like-cooking spot for us that I've forgotten to review them until now. I think their BBQ offerings are just OK. I've had better and I've had worse. In general, I think Charlotte has a huge void of REALLY good BBQ spots, but I digress.   Where Improper Pig really shines is with their Asian fusion specials! Be it Pad Thai, Spicy Basil, Fried Rice, etc. I love it all! The Asian flavors mixed with the smoked meats just can't be beat. The Chow Bao Taco, which is on their menu full time, is also delish. And, I could eat buckets full of those spicy green beans.   We like sitting at the bar ($4 Charlotte drafts on Sundays!) where they have a couple big TVs to watch whatever big game may be on. Their beer selection is decent. They always have at least 4 or 5 good local selections on draft.   Service is always attentive and friendly. And, to top it all off, we can usually find a Groupon or coupon to save us a few bucks."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Just had my first meal at The Improper Pig and it was AMAZING.  Dinner with the family - everyone raved throughout the entire meal about how good the food was. I had brisket with jalapeño grits and Brussel Sprouts, and it was the best brisket I've had in Charlotte. Moist, tender, perfectly smoked, not too fatty, and not too lean and very delicious.  The jalapeño grits were (OMG) so creamy and addictively tasty. I could eat them every day, seriously. My son had pulled pork, which I also tasted, and it was fantastic. The only thing I didn't sample was my wife's Korean BBQ salmon, but honestly it was all good and we can't wait to go back again.  Service was fast and friendly. These people know what they're doing with BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"The Improper Pig is one of my favorite Barbeque restaurants. Not only is the service outstanding but the food is delightful!   The menu offers a southern twist with an Asian flair, ready to excite your pallet. I love The Improper Charcuterie Entree. This order is served with Ribs, Brisket, sausage, shredded pork, pimento cheese and a corn muffin. My favorite side items are the Mac & Cheese, and Collard Greens.  Other Favorites include: - Improper Nachos (with Pork or Brisket)  - Pork Roll - Twice Baked Jalapenos  - Tacos (The Oinker, Big Katuna, The Squeeler)  Let's not forget the BBQ sauces! Each table has a lovely assortment of housemade Sauces."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but not anything exciting. We ordered a bunch of sides to get a mix of things and nothing really stood out. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Okay, always a risk when taking a vegetarian to a barbecue joint.   NO FEAR HERE.    This place has amazing vegetarian sides that are full of flavor.  The spicy green beans, jalapeño cheddar grits, and collards are the best.  I've never before had those three without adding salt/pepper.  My wife is usually meh on grits but would like a take home bucket of these!  The pork BBQ is delicious, the platter served on allows for multiple sauces to be tried.  The pickled onions are great for clearing he palette between tastes.   Pace yourself and be sure to get the blackberry cobbler, its sinful without being overly sweet.   Friendly helpful staff and Gavin (manager?) cares about his customers.    4 thumbs up.   Looking forward to the Fort Mill location in March!"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue. Located in the Cotswold shopping center. We got the Cotswold platter which includes two meats, two sides, and some cornbread. My favorite side here is the sweet potato waffle fries - hands down the best sweet potato fries that you can find in Charlotte! They also have a nice variety of homemade sauces that you can have with your barbecued meats."}
{"text":"I met a few friends here for dinner after it came recommended from another friend.  Glad to see a locally owned restaurant in Cotswold.  The area was getting too populated with chains.  So the place features barbecue with an asian twist and has plenty of options for vegetarians as well like Smoked tofu for your protein.  Everything Vegetarian is marked with a V on the menu.  Good job in pointing it out for us!   The seating is a mix of booths, high top tables, bar seating and a nice outdoor patio.  At the recommendation of our server, I went with the side plate with the choices of brussels sprouts, asian slaw, the veggie of the week and the jalapeno cheese grits.  Normally I am not a grits fan but these were really good!  The other 3 sides were good but not great in my opinion.    Still, I wan to come back here and try the smoked tofu and their other vegetarian options.  I see plenty of promise here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been coming here for the past 10 months now after moving from southern CA. So dangerously close to my house. Nice & friendly service. Love their shrimp tacos, bbq & ahi tuna salads. Yum!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was great. The Thai barbecue sauce was awesome.  The side were just ok nothing special. I had the waffle sweet potato fries, oriental slaw ( didn't have much of oriental favor at all). My husband had the cotswold platter. He love the pulled pork a lot, didn't care for the pulled chicken or the side of coleslaw(not much favor) . He said meat wasn't warm  by the time it got to the table.  We were there at lunch  may be why it was cold by time it got to us at table. Also BBQ without a bun... Wish they would serve all plate with a bun.  I would advised to try bbq pulled pork for sure with Thai sauce."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved from uptown Charlotte to Cotswold and decided to finally check this place out. Glad we did! The food was delicious. We ordered the jalapeño appetizer and although it was smaller than we thought, it was still very tasty. I would probably order something else next time for an app, though, only due to the size.   We split the Improper Charcuterie board and it was fantastic! The pimento cheese that comes with it.... um hellllooo?! Where have I been? The only better pimento cheese I've had in clt is at F?d at Sal?d in NoDa.   Service was great as well! We can't wait to go back to try new things from their menu!"}
{"text":"Similar to baseball i like to give a restaurant three trys before finally making a decision wether i like the place or not. The first two times we came we had the same server. She was great. Attentive, fast and clearly knew the menu.  This was not the case with our server today. After we ordered food, our server didnt return to the table until our food was up. Which usually is fine but our food took so long that i was sipping on melted ice by then. I then had to ask for more soda. After that our server stood in plain sight talking with some other servers until Ann(the server we had the first two times) came up and cleared our table and asked jill our actually server to get our bill together.  As far as food goes some things are good and others are eh... The salmon i had last time was cook perfectly and seasoned well. The collards i didnt care for but they're vegetarian. I dont think ive ever had vegetarian collards before. The little corn muffin was terrible. This go round i got the half chicken. Was a hair on the dry side but was good. Little extra bbq sauce fixed that. The jalapeno grits were amazing! Pasta salad was very bland. I mixed the pickled onion into it with a little salt and pepper. Made it so much better. As far as bang for your buck goes. Its pretty average i seen alot of reviews saying the portions were small for the price. That was my first impression but after almost cleaning my plate i was full.  I may give this place one last shot..."}
{"text":"I am so, so glad that The Improper Pig has made Cotswold its home. I have lived in the area for years and visit the Cotswold Shopping Center probably once a day, if not more. I got very bored of Subway, Panera and Dairy Queen (hey, they do serve actual food...).   My first visit to The Improper Pig was for a quick dinner with a friend. We were seated quickly and approached by a friendly server within minutes. I got a peach flavored margarita which was delicious and fairly priced. Both my friend and I chose the Cotswold Plate with the chicken option. The food came out quickly, and honestly, I don't think I could have devoured my meal any quicker.  The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Our server went over all of the barbecue sauce options that accompany the table. It was a very informative mini-BBQ sauce lesson (region, sauce taste, ingredients) which I appreciated! Each one that I tried went extremely well with the chicken.  Each plate comes with a small portion of pickled onions which I enjoyed. I wish that there was a bigger helping of cornbread, but alas, it hit the spot. My two side options were the sweet potato hash, and BY FAR, the star of my meal... jalapeno cheese grits.   You know those food items that make your mouth water at the simple thought of the dish? That's the jalapeno cheese grits for me. The grits were a perfect texture - not too thick, not too runny. The creamy taste of the cheese and the pop of the jalapeno sent my taste buds to heaven. I literally licked the spoon they were so good. I could eat those grits every day for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Don't get me wrong, the sweet potato hash was amazing too, but definitely was out shined by the grits.  Overall - great ambiance and customer service. Amazing food for the price. I am a huge fan of this establishment and can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"So many things I want to try on this menu! The BBQ sauces are all great, but the honey mustard and the spicy one (you have to ask for from the fridge) were my favorite. My friend and I split the meat sampler and a burger. Best idea of the day. All were excellent. Of the meat choices the beef brisket seemed to have the best flavor. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's not the best and it's not the worst.  I'm glad they switched to bbq though, it's a nice option for the area.  I wasn't a fan of the collards as there were a lot of big stems and veins which weren't fun to crunch into, but the flavor was good...not too much vinegar and a hint of heat.  The Mac n cheese was cheesy but just normal m&c,  The brisket & pork were well-cooked and flavorful but they need to go a little lighter on the tenderizer.  I loved the sauces...liked that they were all on the table cause I like to mix it up for different delicious bites.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive and available.  Very pleasant guy."}
{"text":"Today my work associates and I stopped by the Improper Pig for lunch at the Cotswold location. I have heard good things about this place before, but I was not prepared for how absolutely delicious the food would be.   We were greeted, welcomed and sat immediately on their spacious, comfortable outside patio. We were also greeted by our server within moments of sitting at the table, who had a great attitude and gave us prompt service throughout the meal. Our waters were never empty and that is quite refreshing on a warm patio.   The manager Christian came by to greet us and discuss the specials and his favorite menu items, which sounded so fabulous, one of my associates ended up going with his suggestion of the ribs - he was not disappointed.   Our meal started off with an order of the Twice Baked Jalapeños appetizer. The cilantro lime crema and spiciness was absolutely amazing. The manager even gave us a tip to try it with the sweet and sour sauce, which helped balance out the spice. These were so delicious, I could have eaten an entire plate of them for my entrée.   Our table ordered the following: St Louis Style Ribs with a side of Sweet Potato Hash and Green Beans, BBQ Salad with pulled pork, Pulled pork platter with black bean salad side, and my choice, the special burger, the Belly Burger.   Every entrée was met with extreme satisfaction - ribs were cooking to perfection, the BBQ salad in my associates words was \"the best BBQ salad I have ever had\", and my burger was so good, I ate every single bite on my plate.   The Belly Burger was 70% Beef, 30% pork, blue cheese, special sweet Mary's BBQ, pickled onions, arugula, and tomato. I worked at Bad Daddy's for almost four years and in my entire time working there, haven't had a burger as tasty as this one. So absolutely phenomenal. The homemade chips were delicious as well that came on the side.   I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that hasn't tried. While reviewing their menu, I noticed a ton of options for all types of eaters - tofu, vegetarian, gluten free, vegan, etc. They also appeared to have a nice bar selection, although this was a work lunch so we did not delve too much into those options! Service was impeccable and the manager Christian was extremely welcoming and informative on the menu. We are now Raving Fans and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte from Asheville, stopped at the Resident Culture Brewery and saw the Improper Pig food truck. When I see barbecue I have to try it, I can't lie. So we got the nachos added pulled pork of course... now these nachos are delicious and for the normal person they are perfect just the way they are. But if you're a spice lover like me, when you get the nachos ask them to add that spicy barbecue sauce to the nachos... this sauce kicks this up to the next level! They were SLAMMING!!! Must try!! Also the guys working we're on their game, very polite, great conversation, and great people. Keep it up guys you are on point for sure!!! Hire these guys for your bar or event, you won't be let down. Bet!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I'm curious if I would've liked it more in person rather than getting a Postmates delivery.   I liked the andouille sausage quite a bit, although I would have been happier with a bit more heat. The brisket was much fattier than I prefer. I realize that this is largely personal preference, but I dislike fatty cuts (and a lot of BBQ places will ask you how you want your brisket). Plus, it was $4 more to add to the platter. Sweet potato fries were kinda flavorless. I did like the slaw. The improper nachos were good, but there was definitely not enough cheese for the amount of chips.   I think that the price of this place didn't match the quality. I strongly prefer Midwood Barbecue. I'd be willing to come back in person and see if the food is better when dining in, but it won't be a priority."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service.  Tasteless BBQ with the semblance of it's essence. The pulled pork and brisket ($4) (Cotswold Platter $14) had no taste and had to be drowned in their 6 choices of sauces that ranged from vinegar mustard to spicy hoisin with Queen Bee on the top as sweet bbq. The spicy green beans and mac and cheese ($1 extra per gourmet side) were decent but forgettable. And to pay $4 more for 3 thin slabs of brisket... I was appalled. Stay away from the roasted brussel sprouts ($4), though I'd call it nouveau with cranberries and bacon, they honestly were mush and more like steamed then lightly stir fried together.  The pork roll ($4.50) was highway robbery. One deep fried egg roll with some pulled pork and two dipping sauces. The onion rings ($5.95) had an interesting bite. Chewy and crispy at the same time with a nice ranch dip.  Fantastic service. I noticed other guests felt that it was slow or they seemed to be forgotten but I was okay taking my time."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had such high expectations for the food but was sadly disappointed. Our service was great and the facility itself looked busy. There was no wait and we were sat immediately. The environment was fun and modern. However, the food was subpar. I got the Cotswold Burger and the toppings were good but the burger itself was dry. The Brussels sprouts tasted like kimchi and I wasn't a fan. The best thing we got all night were the spicy (not really) green beans and I would definitely recommend. The nachos were okay but the chips tasted kind of burnt."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Food and service were great.  JD rocks.  Ribs were delicious.  Location good.  If in Charlotte North Carolina a must."}
{"text":"Going to the improper pig was ok the meat is seasoned well the smoked meat had great favor but nothing that blows you away. The beans were nothing to write home about and the sweet potato fries were cold, but 2nd second order were much better. I am a lover of brisket however I wasn't in love with one. Honestly it wasn't the worst I've ever had, but on the brisket I'd  give it a 6. Great taste of smoke and nice smoke ring but favor didn't penetrate deep enough for my liking. However the sauces were really complementary to their style of meat."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. The jalapeño grits are awesome!!!! The pork and chicken are flavored well and not over cooked. They also have great sauce choices at the table."}
{"text":"Finally had enough time to kill when visiting the Cotswold Shopping Center to stop in to this place for a couple of appetizers. Had to get the Improper Nachos because pimento cheese and pulled pork. We also tried the smoked wings. Got them plain so we could utilize the sauces in the caddy on the bar. Both were great! Had a jalapeno margarita that was tasty as well! Definitely want to go back and have a full meal."}
{"text":"I have to rate at least 1 star therefore, the review will be just that. I HATE giving negative reviews almost as bad as giving my nieces and nephews spankings. It pains me. The food.. no flavor.. the brisket tastes like pot roast. The chicken semi-dry and also is lacking flavor. Nothing tasted as if it had been smoked. The ribs were tough. The collards had too much vinegar.  The semi pleasurable items were the southern egg rolls and green beans. I do not understand or cannot comprehend how this place received a 4 out of 5. The server had an attitude as we explained our grievances, which in turn made the manager apprehensive to approach our table. The plates ARE OVERPRICED for the caliber of food you receive. If you want a good margarita, this is the place or if you want great hot sauce (you can purchase in a grocery storee) this is the place. Horrible experience! Won't be coming back.   TOTALLY IMPROPER!"}
{"text":"Love the make-over from Mama Fu's to the new Improper Pig..the wings are the best I've ever had and that's a challenge because I'm a wings snob :)  Great atmosphere..great for family, kids or just a good 'ole date night. The service is stellar and someone from management always checks in. I have been several times now and have been impressed every time..I'll be back many times!!"}
{"text":"Decent old fashion.  My burger was very tasty but over poke. Same with my daughter's burger. Sweet potato fries were delicious and my wife really enjoyed her ahi tuna salad!  The service was awesome!!!  I look forward to going back for a few drinks when we don't have the kids."}
{"text":"Now that I've moved to Cotswald, decided to check out The Improper Pig tonight. I just opened in December. My dad and his wife, my wife, and even my 14-month old son were amazed at the quality of the food. They had 6 sauces to choose from (well, one was Frank's Red Hot, so I guess 5). Mustard, Eastern NC, Western NC, Spicy Hoisin, and Thai. This place touts itself as an Asian inspired BBQ joint, and does well at just that without pulling too far away from the roots of NC BBQ (and other states, too). I had, and I must recommend if you go there, the Improper Charcuterie. It's basically a sampler plate. You get pulled pork, andouille sausage, beef brisket, St. Louis style ribs, house made salt and vinegar chips with pimento cheese to dip, a tiny cornbread muffin, and slaw. It's hard for me to pick a favorite meat because everything was phenomenal. And the sauces...oh, the sauces! The NC Eastern was a bit sweeter than I'm used to, but still had enough spice and a prefect pairing to the pulled pork. The NC Western had a nice spicy kick, more like hot Memphis sauce actually, and went perfectly with the ribs. The mustard was great (though I didn't really have a great pairing for it meat-wise), the spicy hoisin was a perfect pairing to the beef brisket, and the Thai sauce was awesome on the southern egg roll, which was made with sweet potatoes inside. I was skeptical about a sweet potato egg roll, mainly because I'm not crazy about sweet potatoes, but it was only $2.50, so I couldn't resist and it was worth it. And it was pretty big - 7 or 8 bites at least. I don't think I'll ever come back here without getting one.  I was really hoping for a good barbecue joint in my new 'hood, and I hit the jackpot tonight. This place is great!"}
{"text":"This place was in diners dives and drive ins and maybe gone down hill since then .  Place tries to be original with Korean southern BBQ.  It is nice space and service was good.  It was taco Tuesday so tried three types.  None wowed me although maybe because had better tacos from trucks in nyc.   The person next to me ordered brisket which looked like pork.  They claimed they serve there brisket cut up but it sure look like pork to me also."}
{"text":"Went in after a Panthers game. Aka after work. Loved the menu. I could have picked any one of 10 things, especially on the specials menu. The special burger looked amazing. Love the Asian BBQ fusion. Service was quick and attentive. I went with the BBQ chicken, sweet potato hash and the Brussels. Really like the Brussels. The sweet potato hash was tasty but more like a mash. The chicken was tender. The sauce gave it flavor. Wife had the Asian salad and we both loved that. I would go back to try the special burger or sandwich and maybe go more on the Asian side."}
{"text":"I Recently moved to the area and was craving BBQ. After reading the yelp reviews we decided to try them out and I'm glad we did! I had the Costwold platter with pulled pork and chicken with baked beans and coleslaw. My bf had the full rack of ribs with baked beans, everything was delicious. The chicken and pork were juicy and those beans were awesome! The ribs were tender but a little dry for his liking(they were ok to me) our waitress was very knowledgeable about the bbq sauces and the Smokey sauce was the right one for us. Although we didn't dine in our food was still hot and fresh when we got home. I will visit again probably on a Monday when my 9yr old can eat for 99 cents when you dine in."}
{"text":"The Improper Pig 110 S Sharon Amity Rd Charlotte, NC 28211 Friday May 12, 2017 8:30pm  I have been putting off visiting The Improper Pig and I am mad at myself for doing that. They have really transformed this little space and I'm so glad they have!  On our visit we were quickly seated and our server came right over. The menu isn't extensive but it's got loads of options and what really kills me is there are monthly specials. It was a hard decision but I had to choose one of the specials.   This months specials are the Mac and Cheese BBQ Burrito and the BBQ  Fried Rice. Since I love all things Asian Fusion I had to try the BBQ Fried Rice with BBQ pork. I also added the andouille sausage to the entree.   This dish was a very large portion and I had enough for lunch the next day. There a lot of crispy BBQ pieces through out the dish and the sauce that accompanies the rice along with the Queen Bee BBQ sauce really set it apart from other fried rice dishes I've had.   Two of my friends had the Cotswold Platter. One had the Platter with BBQ Pork and BBQ tofu. I'm not the hugest fan of tofu but this had a good taste. It wasn't the firm type of tofu but held its ground with the BBQ pork. The sides that they got were the green beans and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was very runny and she needed a spoon. The other Cotswold Platter had BBQ Chicken and BBQ Pork, Collard greens and  the Jalapeño  grits. All very good choices. My other friend tried the other special the Mac and Cheese BBQ Burrito. I got a little taste of this and the flavors work so well together.  Another great thing they got going on is a wide variety of BBQ sauces. My fav from the options was the Queen Bee. What I can remember is the Tong's Thai is a very runny sauce that looks like sweet chili sauce.   I was torn between the special and The BBQ salad so I will have to return and try the salad and perhaps some of the other monthly specials."}
{"text":"Barbeque in charlotte is filled with stiff competition. The improper pig is definitely up there in ranking. The menu is decent but is pretty short and options can be slim. The pulled pork sandwhich was great and the sauce selection is good as well. If you want some good consistent barbeque stop on by."}
{"text":"Went back to check this place out again.  Was a little let down compared to last time.  The ribs were really tough.  The Brussel Sprouts were not prepared the same way that they were in my initial visit, which was a let down.  Something about the place just isnt jiving...and i cant pin point it.    I hope they make it....we need some good options in Cotswold."}
{"text":"So happy to see another restaurant in Cotswold!    We've been twice and enjoyed our food both times.  This last time I had the beet salad and added chicken, my husband had ribs and jalapeno cheddar grits, and my daughter (2 years old) had mac and cheese and applesauce.  Service was top notch both times, and we appreciated that it was kid friendly.  Saw that you can take the meat home by the pound, too.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place in Cotswold. Based on other reviews, I tried the pulled chicken, collards and slaw. I was disappointed with the chicken - it was dry and had been prepared with too much rub that just sat on the meat rather than imparting flavor. Collards were good, but the slaw was not flavorful. Tasted Like cabbage with a little vinegar. My husband's pulled pork was a little fatty. Will probably give it another try after they have had time to settle in a bit and make adjustments. It is so convenient and well-like cates that I hope it will become an institution."}
{"text":"I wasn't the biggest fan after the first time here but starting to think that was an anomaly.  Definitely try the \"fusion features\" on the menu....they typically have great stuff there and its reasonably priced.  Service is always friendly and its easily a top 3 spot within a mile or 2 for take out.  BBQ is good with a great choice of sauces...solid all around neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"We got carry out of 1 pound sausage, 1 pound pulled pork, 1 pound pulled chicken... The sausage and pulled pork work big hits and our dinner party as were the sauces... The pulled chicken was a little bit dry.  We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Wow, I received the most amazing service and an amazing meal! I sat at the bar and the bartender was kind enough to tell me it was \"burger week\" and they had a specific burger for only $5! Well, this thing was huge, and it could have been tailor-made for me! Really hit the spot. One of the best burgers I've ever had. I spoke with the chef, too, and he was great. I'd give this place 6-stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Great food!!Great food!!Great food!! Smoked meats and sauces make for a food playground of deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken this long to eat @ the Pig! What a delightful surprise it was! If only barbecue could take a spin on it the way the pig has done with it, I would eat it more often!! To begin with the cleanest version of jalapeño poppers we have ever had that were roasted and so delicious to the \"Cotswold Platter\" to the Southwestern Chopped salad with tasty ripe avocados throughout , and to finish with the improper pork sliders for the kiddies. What a great, \"go to place\". The atmosphere was nice and peaceful on a Tuesday night with many tables outside we had a few choices to sit inside not on top of people with our kiddies.  Will definitely will be back and are sorry we waited too long to come and try!!"}
{"text":"We were going to Ovens Auditorium for a concert, and he was in the mood for Asian, and I wanted BBQ, so this was a great compromise.  It's a great fusion blend of Korean and Southern food. The decor is really cool, it's industrial while still feeling cozy.   Our server was great.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and laid back.  We tried the onion rings with ranch dip for an appetizer.  They were hot, fresh, and crunchy, but nothing extraordinary.   For entrees, I got the bao bun taco with chicken as my meat, and a side of baked beans.  My fiancee got the pimento grilled cheese with smoked tomato and bacon, and Mac and cheese on the side.  They were both fantastic.  My chicken was tender, moist, and topped with a delicious hoison bbq sauce (if they make that in house, they need to bottle it, and sell it!)  I'm not a fan of southern slaw, but this Asian slaw was amazing.  It had a great ratio of cilantro in it, and I believe I tasted a lime/vinegar mix. The beans were delicious, and I was excited that they used an assortment of beans to make it.  His pimento grilled cheese was melt in your mouth goodness.  The Mac and cheese was true perfection, because it was actually made with real cheese versus the Velveeta crap tjhat most restaurants around here use.  We share a peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice cream sandwich for dessert.  It was spectacular and decadent.  My only thought was it was big enough for 4, so we ended up wasting about half.   We will definitely be back.  This place was delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I ate there this afternoon for lunch and we had never been here before.  I was a bit skeptical going in, and the waitress told us the specials and the \"Belly Burger\" was one of them and sounded interesting, 70% beef 30% pork and had blue cheese crumbles with a tangy BBQ sauce (I believe it was Mary B's BBQ sauce but not sure because the special is not on the menu), bacon on top of that and homemade chips on the side.  I thought it was one of the best burgers I have ever had!!  Wife got the Pulled Pork plate and shared with our daughter and mixed a couple sauces that she liked and it was really good too.    Server was very friendly and answered our questions and was pretty busy so a slight wait on getting drinks filled but not her fault, it is a crowded place at lunch time.  We loved the ambiance of the place too, kind of a strange fusion between asian and BBQ but it works!  Looking forward to trying some other things, I noticed a lot of nice things said about the egg roll appetizers.    Only suggestion would be to put that Belly Burger special on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for BBQ.  The overall quality of the food was good.  The flavor of the sauces was good too.  The service was decent, nothing special.  I probably won't be back because there are other places I'd rather spend my money on."}
{"text":"A friend invited me out to Improper Pig for Saturday dinner. If you're looking for Pork, this is the place to go. After wavering between the salmon and the ribs. I ended up going with the ribs with a side of sweet potato hash. The ribs were well seasoned and fell off of the bone. They really didn't need any sauce. However, I tried each and every one offered. The sauces are Asian inspired, so there was no basic BBQ sauce. Queen Bee - SWEET BBQ; Mary's - taste like ketchup; Tong Tai - spicy sweet vinaigrette; Eastern Vinegar - vinegar w/ a kick; Spicy Hoilson - Spicy Teryaki; Mustard - any other mustard sause. I settled on mixing the Spicy Hoilson (which was best) and Queen Bee. The spicy sauces are VERY spicy, so be prepared.  I didn't like the sweet potato hash. I was expecting something sweet. However, there were onions and maybe garlic mixed in, which eliminated the sweetness and overall I wasn't a fan. Just don't order this expecting something sweet.  My friend had their chocolate cake for dessert, which she like. I had the house margarita, which was the drink of the day. Their house margarita is actually an orange margarita, which my waitress failed to mention. It was okay. While she was patient, she could have been far more informative. Nevertheless, this is a BBQ pork restaurant and based on that, I will judge it. Thus four stars. If you're looking for BBQ, the Improper Pig is the place to go in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this spot for lunch as it is close to my work, and I am so glad that I did. Not only is the atmosphere great but the services was too! I felt so welcomed, and was seated immediately. The food was great, my fiance ordered the jalapenos for an appetizer and wow, there were fabulous, wish they were a bit spicier but we both love spicy foods. I ordered the BBQ salmon and he order the platter, and we both were stuffed! The food was cooked perfectly and the sides were so tasty. If we didn't have to go back to work I would have checked out their great drink specials! The prices were right on and again the service was wonderful, we will be back for sure and highly recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"Came  here after doing some work in Columbia SC. Asked the person at the hotel for some recommendations and mentioned I like bar b que. She came through with a few suggestions including this place. It was a bit of a drive but well worth it. It's in a strip mall right next to a Starbucks. Nice atmosphere, some outside seating (with a view of the parking lot). Got seated right away and served by Tiffany who was really nice. She walked me through some of the specials and when I asked for a taste of one of the  local beers she brought it to me quickly. I had the jalapeño appetizer which was great. Not actually spicy but great flavor. I went big and got the charcuterie platter which has a taste of a bunch of meats. The pulled pork was a little fatty but had great flavor. The brisket and sausage were also good. The ribs were not falling off the bone but had good flavor and that's before adding some of the sauces. I like the spicy hoisen which had a kick (it might blow out your taste buds)  as well as the vinegar based (hey, when in Carolina,) and the tomato based was also good. Nothing prepackaged here. The only regret was that there weren't enough homemade chips to scoop up the yummy pimento cheese. They have a nice drink menu with lots of high end whiskey and other inventive drinks. I'm a beer man so I went with one on tap. Quite good. One other nice note, I was here towards the end of the evening and I watched the staff doing some clean up. It was nice to see people who at least appeared to be enjoying their jobs. Saw a few families here. Nice place and totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"It's ok. My food was decent, but kind of dry and greasy. I'm not sure how that convo even happened.  Also, it's in a weird location in a shopping plaza next to a grocery store. I'd rather go to Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Pork nachos were loaded, sides were ok. Not enough cheese on the nachos, had to ask for more. Mac and cheese was tasteless. Cole slaw was good. The end. Was that proper enough?"}
{"text":"The food is great. We were seated quickly and our order was taken as quick. The brisket is very very tender and the shrimp tacos are great!! We endulged and had the blueberry/ blackberry cobbler with a scoop if ice cream too. Can you say WOW! They bright is in a cast iron skillet straight from the oven !!!"}
{"text":"After doing much research about good bbq places in Charlotte, I came upon this gem. We came in for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. We ordered the nachos and smokes wings for appetizers. The wings had fantastic smoke flavor and were nice and crispy. The cheese sauce for the nachos was a pimento cheese sauce that I had been longing to try whilst down south, and it lived up to my expectations. We ordered ribs, brisket, smoked chicken, and pork. All was delicious. I had the ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender. The rub used had just the right about of heat and sweetness, that I didn't even need to use 1 of their 6 bbq sauces offered.  When our food arrived, a man, who seemed to be manager, happily described the 5 sauces on the table, with the addition of a spicier, asian inspired sauce available by request.  To top off the amazing lunch we had, the manager came by our table again, asking if we would be interested in a strawberry cobbler on the house. Of course, I said yes. The cobbler consisted of a sweet and crunchy crumb-cookie topping, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a delicious, warm strawberry center.  The service was very friendly and hands on. I would definitely come here again when passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, many different options on their menu including Korean BBQ Salmon, Smoked Chicken both are excellent as are their spicy green beans. Attentive servers, small but quaint atmosphere, 2 TV's on sports at bar and a patio option for warmer weather. Fair price point makes it affordable for a date or family outing. Highly recommend this fantastic low-key place to eat in Cotswold Shopping Center."}
{"text":"So many yummy choices....all good. Good service. Try all the apps! Food comes out quick. Extensive bar menu. You must try the Jalepeno Grits!!! To die for!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had been here one time last year and enjoyed it. So recently I picked it for a Saturday night date night. We were seated right when we walked in and ordered drinks (Stella for me, margarita for him). We were both pleased with our drinks (he described his as tart but good).   We started with the pork roll, which was really good but a not so good portion size. It is listed as an appetizer but is more like a side item. It is one egg roll cut in half. It was good but for the price, you should at least get two!  My fella had the improper charcuterie, which he loved. In fact he told me that he doesn't think he would order anything else. I had the salmon chow bao taco with green beans. I liked both. The slaw on the taco lacked flavor so I ended up just taking most of it off, but it was tasty and I loved the sauce on the salmon. The green beans are awesome! I could eat them all day every day!  Overall, it was a date night success. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were out shopping at Ulta and decided to give this place a try! We're glad we did.  We started out with some of their specialty cocktails. I ordered the Orange and Blueberry smash and it was worth the price. They are generous on their whiskey pour and you won't need to order another one. One of the girls that was with us is vegetarian and the other gave up meat for Lent. Neither one of them had a hard time finding something on the menu. One friend ordered the salmon tacos and I immediately had regrets about my order. Delicious and you should definitely order them! I ordered the southwest salad and added chicken. It was not my favorite and wish I had went with the brisket with a side. I can't wait to go back and actually order some of their BBQ.  I think the server was having a bad day because our service was pretty terrible.  I think she even forgot about us when we asked for our check. I'll definitely give this place another try. Loved their background music...a lot of 90's grunge which is a WIN in my book!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Improper Pig and I was very impressed with the food.   I liked the look and feel inside the restaurant and they have a patio area.    In regards to the food.... I ordered a half rack of ribs with a side of Mac and cheese.  And then I ordered one additional side of the collard greens.  A half of rack with one side was $14.  I would think that for a rib plate...it would automatically come with two sides.  My husband ordered a pulled pork plate with the jalapeño grits and Mac and cheese.  After trying my ribs and my husband's pulled pork, I ended up trading with him.  The pulled pork was better than the ribs.  The ribs wasnt as tender as Midwood.  But the pulled pork was really good.  I paired the pulled pork with the Queen Bee sauce since its a sweet BBQ sauce.   But what I really loved was the mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy and I could tell that they used cheddar cheese to make it.  The collard greens were good, although once you get to the bottom....it drowned in vinegar.  The jalapeño cheese grits was good too... Even though it wasn't as thick as I'm use to.  Nevertheless, it was still good.    Prior to ordering our entrées, we had the southern egg rolls.  There was only one thing missing....these rolls does not include meat.  If they were to put pull pork in their rolls, then it would have been better.  But I won't complain because it was still good and it was a free appetizer.  If you download their stealz app, they give you the appetizer for free.  So that was nice.  Overall, I liked this place for their pulled pork and Mac and cheese. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The Asian Fusion dishes are always amazing.  The fried rice is the best.  Always good food and service.  Drink specials are great too.  Only wish they had a better beer selection."}
{"text":"Nice patio, very attentive service.   Excellent food - lots of flavor and carefully prepared.   Prices are a bit high for portion size, which is the only thing keeping them from getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place. Saw on the door that they were recently featured on a food network show and heard several other diners discussing the show. One would assume being featured would mean the food is superb...until you realize it was Dinner, Drive in and Dives and you figure out Guy has zero tastes in good food.   Ordered the Cotswold plate with pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and collard greens. The food came our quickly, but the compliments unfortunately end there. The collards were nice and spicy, but lacked flavor. The Mac and cheese was overcooked and underseasoned, think instant Mac. And the BBQ while decent was not super smokey. Oh and the cornbread was a bite size muffin not sure maybe it was made for ants.   Sampled all the BBQ sauce as well. 1. Queen Bee- too sweet 2. Mary B's also coyingly sweet 3. Tony's Thai was basically sweet and sour sauce. I will say the mustard sauce was good if that is your thing and the vinegar was nicely spiced albeit too sweet as well.   To make matters worse the place was relatively empty and yet I only saw my waiter twice. I took about twenty minutes to eat and my server was to never be seen again until the bill came. Never even asked how the food was or if I needed anything.  I personally will be sticking to Midwood Smokehouse. This place could be great though if they just worked on the food and service. At least they have good beer specials $4 local pints on Sunday."}
{"text":"I came in after talking myself out of bbq the last time nearby. I was greeted by three staff members before even making it to my table. I felt very welcomed. I started with a pork stuffed egg roll. It's not on the menu but was a special today. (YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT, INCREDIBLE!!)  Next, I ordered the Cotswold Plate. brisket with Mac and cheese and Jalapeño grits. SOOOO GOOOD!!! The brisket melts in your mouth. The Mac and cheese could use a little more flavor. It's good but could benefit from more flavor.   For the grand finale, I ordered the ice cream sandwich. I was told that they are made by the owner and his daughter every morning for their bonding time. Too sweet.  Peanut butter cookies with chocolate ice cream in the middle. Yes! Yes! Yes! I recommend this place. Everything was perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. I've never actually eaten in but usually order takeout which is super easy on their website.  Let me just say how much I love their jalapeño cheese grits. My mouth is watering just thinking about when I was eating them. I just wish they had some sort of hush puppy. Maybe they do and I just missed it completely."}
{"text":"I was initially introduced to The Improper Pig about a year ago at an awesome Yelp event. They served delicious Pork Belly. I made all the promises that I would make it out to this location and definitely get to know the menu. Of course that did not happen. However I finally made it. My foodie boss and I ventured to the Cotswold side of town and I finally made it to their patio.   My boss is a native North Carolinian and she loves her Pork BBQ- so naturally we ordered the lunch plate portion of BBQ and sides... and that is where we went wrong. Now don't get me wrong. The Improper Pig has great food I'm sure and they definitely have delicious BBQ sauces.. but wow.. we weren't prepared for the underwhelming Pork BBQ.   The BBQ was bland... it did not seem to have any seasoning.. definitely not the type of seasoning I have come to expect with southern Pork BBQ. The meat it self was light in color and texture, was missing burnt/ crisp edges or ends and was overall under seasoned. I decided to use the BBQ they provided with came with an intense amount of seasonings- I think it was the Eastern style ( I could be mistaken). The sauce added some flavor.. but not the right kind and definitely not in the right way.   Sides. The sides were no better. Actually they were worst. Anyone who enjoys a good BBQ knows that the sides can be the best part of the meal. We had Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens.... I hear the Greens were good... but the Mac ... Yikes.. Reminded me of missteps in late night Kraft Mac in the dorm. :( It seemed to be an off day, or the mac is made with some weird powder mixture cheese...   On a good note... Wonderfully positive note. - I sometimes can have an upset tummy from eating to much BBQ Pork.. - No tummy ache after I left here."}
{"text":"Im seriously thinking that the Charlotte eats scene is on the comeup and I may be finally proud to have out of town folk come and visit me. The Improper Pig will be one of the places we stop! Hopefully, my server, whose name I think is Jake, will still be there to greet us. He showered me with impeccable service!   I started with the Southern Rolls! Jake warned me that the mustard used for presentation was spicy and im glad he did. That first bite brought tears, got me right in the back of my throat and I loved it! All the way yummy!  I ordered the salmon with collards and black eye pea salad.  The salmon was absolutely divine! It came served with their house pickled onions. Which will allow me to tell you what was absolutely perfection... Take those pickled onions and dump them on top of those collards!!!! I was right back in my grandmother's arms. I swear all was missing was some red koolaid and I would have entered heavens gates, even if it was for a short stay. That flavor combo of the greens and onions left me breathless. A gentleman that I'm almost certain was the manager/ owner must have noticed the hazed gaze that came over my eyes and thought something was ary because he stopped to ask if i was ok? I reassured him that I was better than just ok, just experiencing a moment. I  asked if he could box up some of those onions to take home to enjoy with the rest of my greens? He brought me more than enough. I'm about to make me a pitcher of red koolaid, have a seat in my grandmas vanity chair and revisit her this evening. I seriousky could have eaten a bucket full!! And just so you understand, my grandma didn't play when it came to her greens!  You must go to this spot! Ask for Jake! I pray they won't disappoint. But if it means anything to anyone this place got it ALL right for my visit there!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to The Improper Pig. My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and have been trying to find the the time to come in and find out how it was! The staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately. There was a short wait which they ensured it would be worth the wait. We were told 15 minutes and were seated within that time frame. Decor in the restaurant was unique and I felt cozy and enjoyed it. Very raw, with metal and non-treated woods as accents. I love that the draft beer list was all local to NC!! I would like to see them laminate the menus at some point. It's very clean inside and waiting staff is attentive without being overbearing. Ordered margaritas and twice baked jalapeños to start. I ordered pork platter with spicy green beans,my boyfriend the smoked chicken and barbecue platter. We agree the pork is good, and conversation with whom seemed to be one of the owners told us it is smoked in house for about 8 hours. We have a favorite BBQ joint in NY that is hard to compare to, but we think this is a good place. Boyfriend says chicken was good but slightly bland, but very moist. He thinks almost too moist that it became pastyThe Mama B's BBQ sauce was my favorite sauce, with a little spice and a little sweet. Green beans were amazing!!  The only thing we can say about the BBQ is maybe a little more smokey in flavor would be excellent. But enjoyed our meal, with no complaints. We will come back and support. To close, I love the little unique touches on how they serve the meals (stainless steel baking sheets) and how they serve the checks (piece of wood with a clip). Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My family and I found out about this restaurent on Groupon. It was so great. Food and Service. We order the platter and chag. For the price, I was actually surprised how big the portion of the food was and it made it definitely worth the price. They have specials everyday. It was a great place for my 20 month old too. Hint: the closing time on Saturday is 11pm but they started cleaning all around us to go for closing around 9:30pm. It felt kind of weird. So, my hint is to make sure you go and end your meal 1hr and 30mins prior to closing time."}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted some BBQ, once we were seated we realized we had been here before quite some time ago. I could not remember much about the food but was anxious to try it. Let me say this was a great second 1st impression. We ordered the improper  charcuterie so we could try as many meats at one time. We also ordered the Mac and cheese, grilled asparagus, and spicy green beans. I started the meal out eating the sides first and let me say I could have filled up on the sides alone as a meal. The spicy green were amazing, with additional ingredients like chicken and rice it could be a great dish for the menu. Once we started on the meats there was no disappointment there either, our favorite had to be the ribs. We enjoyed our meals but did not use much of the sauces as they were a little too sweet for our taste, not to say they were bad just not to our liking.   We frequent many BBQ restaurants and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Good, casual, easy eats. Ate at the bar. Comfy seats, lots of leg room at the wood bar top and tv's.   Happy with my tofu sandwich on the rice bun and mac n cheese (not handmade but hit the spot).   Dan did the pulled pork and said it was good. Side of Brussels. Spicy.  Good beer and cocktails. Good service but we did arrive at 9:30 on a weeknight. No one else was around."}
{"text":"Super cute modern bbq place that's fit for foodies. Great bar selection. Meats come out dry as in no sauce and then select your sauce from the sauce caddy on the table. Cheese and jalapeños grits are amazing! Sweet potato waffle cut fries are nice and crisp. Kind knowledgeable staff, decent prices and modern decor. I had the pulled chicken, bf had ribs. Great experience."}
{"text":"Very good I got the Beef and Pork belly burger.....very moist and delicious....will return"}
{"text":"The Improper Pig, not sure where to begin. I was so wishing to like it more than I did, but overall just thought it was okay. My dinner group met here on a weekend and were seated on the outdoor, covered patio on cooler nights.  Although it was nice to sit outside service was very slow, as our waitress seemed to be no where to be found several times throughout the evening.  Having not been I was able to enjoy some appetizers that we ordered for the table. The chorizo stuffed jalapeños were by far the best thing I ate the whole night. They were cooked too perfection with a great, but not so hot, kick. The cornbread on the other hand was dry and I definitely had better. And, I am not a kale chip fan, but they needed more salt or seasoning, definitely just blah.  I went ahead and ordered the combo platter with pulled chicken and brisket, with Brussels Sprouts and Sweet Potato Fries. The pulled chicken was just okay, not as moist as I have had or liked and the brisket was good, definitely melt in your mouth moist, but just a lot of fat. As for the sides, I definitely recommend the Sweet Potato Fries, so good!   The Improper Pig offers a variety of sauces tableside, so you can pick and choose. Unfortunately I found most of them a little too sweet and missed a true barbeque sauce.  Overall, I am glad I finally made it to this quaint addition to the Cotswold Shopping Center, but with too many other barbeque joints, that I find better, not sure I would rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant (family, friends, coworkers) come here whenever we're indecisive about what we want to eat...reason being..this place has something for everyone. Asian glazed salmon is my favorite. They have really good mac&cheese ( gotta get it early). I've gotten it for dinner and it was a really runny..so I make sure I get it when I come for lunch. They have apple sauce on the kids menu..amazing!!!!  The brussel sprouts are good..but cooked with bacon..(I found out after I ordered them).  They have a salad that's great, unable to remember the name of it..but it's good..it has roasted sweet potatoes in it."}
{"text":"We went to the improper pig a few weeks ago. The food was really good and you get a lot. The only disappointing item was the slaw. I liked the choice of six sauces too. The service was friendly and attentive without hovering. Overall a good experience ."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a new spot for Taco Tuesday so came here for lunch yesterday and they were packed. No tables left but we found a spot at the bar. The bartender was cool & attentive. They have 5 tacos for the special and I tired all but the veggie one (which I heard I missed out on). There were all really good, the Big KaTuna one being my favorite. Food came out fast even with the crowd. This was actually my second time here & the first time I had a great experience as well. I had the Chow Bao Tacos with the grilled salmon & the salmon was cooked perfect and had great flavor."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! Just dropped in tonight for some takeout as we are passing through the area. I had the No Pig Sandwich and my husband went with the BBQ tofu sandwich. Our son had the kids Mac & cheese. And for extra deliciousness we went with the chocolate cream pie. So good! Ate it all so quickly otherwise I'd have pictures! The staff was also very friendly and attentive which is always a wonderful plus. If we are ever back this way we will definitely be coming in again."}
{"text":"Improper Pig is SO DELICIOUS!!!  My husband and I got the Improper Nachos (ammmmaziiiinggg), he got wings and I got the Asian taco.  Would definitely get these items again next time.  Cute, casual atmosphere, great beer selection, and awesome sauce selection too.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place....after seeing a video on their IG page of all the meat that they were smoking  I was determined to get there and try the food. To say I was disappointed is an understatement...I opted for the Cotswald Platter and chose the pulled pork and pulled chicken with baked beans and mac n cheese. While the food came out quickly my server neglected to properly set me up with silverware...got it only after I asked for it. The restaurant was relatively empty my server seemed disconnected having only checked on me once..which was to drop the check.  The sauces were on the bar and the server basically just slid them in front of with no explanation of the different flavors or types of sauce they offered. The pork was a bit salty and has little to no smokey flavor to it. The chicken was moist but lacked flavor...sauce helped but again no smoke. As for the portions they were small and to be honest as I sit here writing this review I can honestly say that I'm still a bit hungry.  I would probably not go out of my way to dine there again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere & food here...   you can not go wrong if you go grab a bite to eat here.    I def recommend anyone that's in the area to give it a try."}
{"text":"I am from out of town, and my friend brought me to The Improper Pig for dinner. It is situated in a strip mall, which initially threw me, but the inside was really neat! Had a modern, industrial vibe.  The menu had a lot of interesting, unique options. Another yelper posted a picture of the Ahi Tuna Salad, and once I saw a picture I just had to have it. And, yes, it was as good as it looks!  It didn't get 5 stars only because the service was... meh.  Go get ya some Improper Pig if you're near Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We live in Cotswold, so have been to Improper Pig numerous times. Usually it's a to-go order since we live close by. If you have never checked out their \"featured menu\", you must! Each month they have a handful of selections that are only available that month. Such a creative way to keep customers coming back for more and not get tired of grabbing to-go dinner after a long day of work. The food is great, of course. We just love seeing what they will come up with each month!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! The jalapeno cheese grits are a smashing hit!! Lindsay, our server was out of bounds with her hospitality and recommendations!! We have to put this place in our favorite lis."}
{"text":"The pork rolls are excellent and the 2 sauces are really good , I had the Belly Burger which was a pork belly ground beef mix"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time and were very disappointed. Between our two orders, we tried the pork, smoked chicken, collard greens, Mac n cheese, baked beans and jalapeño cheese grits. The pork was decent, nothing special. The chicken was awful. Not only was it kissing a smoked flavor, it was dry. So dry, I could barely swallow it with dousing it in sauce. I guess someone who likes a lot of vinegar in their collards might like them, but I thought they just tasted strange. The mac n cheese was very cheesy but very bland. I did not like at all. The baked beans were sweet, in a strange syrupy liquid unlike any baked bean  I have ever tried. Finally, the guys had a mild jalapeño flavor but again nothing impressive. Def not worthy of the overall 4 stars on Yelp."}
