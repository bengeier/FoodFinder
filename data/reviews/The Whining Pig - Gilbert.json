{"text":"Awesome ... awesome ... awesome. Yes, the beer list is amazing and the prices are great. But the super-friendly service puts this place over the top. Might be my new favorite place."}
{"text":"It's awesome place and good atmosphere . Staff is very kind and friendly . Took my wife and we had a blast."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere, people, and of course the selection are the best in town. Need a place just to hang out or to bring friends? This is your bar. Great for trying new things, meeting new people, and having a great time!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the happy hour! Bartenders are knowledgeable and can recommend drinks which is always a plus. The menu changes and has a good variety for all beer enthusiasts. If you don't care of beer wine, sangria and mead are available as well. If you're feeling brave or just not picky try the $3 brown bag special."}
{"text":"We love it here and always recommend to friends. Love their daily happy hour from 3-8. Friendly and attentive staff. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Gilbert needs more bars like this.  Fun atmosphere that is not a big box chain, and great beer and wine selection.  It can be a challenge at times to find a seat, but that is a good problem to have.  I am a huge craft beer fan and the only other bar in the area with a comparable selection is World of beer (which I also love), but this environment is completely different.  It's also a perk that my girlfriend can enjoy a nice glass of wine while I am having a cold beer."}
{"text":"Great food , Great service,  Great concept.  Wife and I had date night here and had a blast. A must place to check out !!"}
{"text":"My first experience at The Whining Pig was on their opening night, I was nervous that service would be slow, beer selection would be meh and that the food would be mediocre. But man oh man was I proven wrong! Their beer and wine selection was out of this world, their grilled cheeses were on point and their service was legit! :)
I've gone there many times since and they have yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Unbelievable selection of BEER. Great local crowd. Lots of parking. Many smiles. 
Plus, giant chalk boards to create on - Thumbs UP"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, the atmosphere & bartenders are PERFECTION. we come often and the bartenders are super knowledgable and always help me find the perfect porter for my mood! i bring EVERY out of town guest here!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a steal and there is huge selection of beer to choose from! Love the atmosphere of this place! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the area.  Found great reviews on this place.  The reviews had it right.  Fun and fantastic staff.  We did not eat here - just enjoyed their vast selections of beer and wine.  We asked Adian (?) for recommendations.  He nailed it.  How he remembered our names - must be a gift!

Even though it was packed - Saturday night - the service was excellent.  We really enjoyed the staff,  atmosphere,  music and the clientele.  Wish this place was closer.  Thanks guys!

Oh,  the hours on happy hour were super!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great beer selection and fun vibe. Grilled cheese sandwich menu is fantastic. So happy to welcome Whining Pig to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The bartenders were super friendly and attentive. The place is small but a fun set up and it was very packed. We had a great time. They have card games and board games all over that when looking around many people were partaking in. The menu of drinks on the wall was a little overwhelming to try and read and make a quick decision."}
{"text":"I was notified on Yelp when this place opened up. My boyfriend and I are always looking for a good place to hangout and enjoy a few beers. We went in on Sunday to check the place out. We were not disappointed! The atmosphere is nice, the lighting is good and I love the way the bar is set up. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and have many recommendations. The board is color coordinated and the bottle/can beers are sectioned by price. It makes it so easy to look at beers you are interested in. There happy hour is actually a reasonable time that can actually be made and it's everyday rather then just during the week. With over 20 beers on tap and a great price for a flight of beer, this is definitely our new place to grab a beer or two! Oh and the bar is lined with games. This place knows what they are doing! Bravo for making a great bar!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great selection of beer and wine. Lots of board and card games to olay while you hangout and drink. 

The staff was amazing and provided exceptional service. The bartender serving us came around the bar and personally shook each of our hands and introduced himself to us. Was extremely attentive the whole time we were there. You don't come across service like that too often these days. Check this place out..."}
{"text":"Best brew pub I've been to. Staff is friendly and always goes out of their way even if it's a busy night (which it is so be prepared to stand and scope out spots for when people decide to leave)."}
{"text":"My son James took me to the Whining Pig for my birthday. This is such a neat place. Very friendly staff. I didn't know which beer to try so they let me sample a few before I found one I liked. Great food items. On a Saturday night this place was packed with smiling faces. Fun Little neighborhood spot. I recommend you give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice and will keep it as a go to place for craft beer and great service. Dan was very friendly and knowledgeable on beers and took time to make suggestions even when they are very busy."}
{"text":"Oh man. Love this place?

What a great selection!

Very warm and friendly.
Excellent beer bar plus wine and Mead!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: This is a place to drink and be social, not a restaurant per se!! Once you get over that... On to the bulk of the experience!

I ordered the Treana White Wine and the Garnacha from Spain. Both were wonderful and at an amazing price that kind of surprised me! I also ordered the meat and cheese plate which I thought was tasty however - the olives in the middle are NOT made for a charcuterie board, they belong in a martini. I'd leave those off all together or at least offer a better quality olive. ( or just substitute more apricots and walnuts).

People were filing in and out and it seemed to have a steady flow of guests coming in and out! Our batman was great. Very friendly and I noticed a laugh and a smile pop out from under that bushy beard! Wonderful service from him. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an afternoon pick-me-up and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Its an intimate and casual vibe so I felt right at home.  I cannot believe the number of beers they have OMG incredible.  I need to try some cider next time.  Loved their grilled cheese sandwiches and brownies too."}
{"text":"Amazing beer/wine spot in little old Gilbert. About time!!!  Great service, selection, knowledge and food! (Limited food but still delish).  I love how the guys look at what you've had to drink so far, then suggest your next pour.  Now THAT is service!!  Definitely my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This has been my new favorite spot since they opened. You simply cannot go wrong with the amazing beer selection along with the amazing staff. If you are ever unsure what to get, ask Dan as he always knows best!"}
{"text":"Quaint good selection of beers and wines. Good local hang out! Not a place for too many choices for food but lots of IPA beers and good choice of wines."}
{"text":"Super nice beer list - flights reasonable and served quickly.  Very friendly staff, and funky fun atmosphere.  We were disappointed in the food available - multiple grilled cheese offerings, a charcuterie plate, or a few desserts...meh.  One side of the bar is much more roomy than the other, we filled out one of the last spots available (this place is very small...) and were on the \"tight\" side.  Not uncomfortable, but a little claustrophobic.

I'll be back for the great beer selection and friendly people...and plan on eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at the whining pig and it was great. My coworkers and I came here after work and it was an awesome night. I was able to talk to Clayton (the owner) and he is a chill dude, everything was perfect from the beers to the atmosphere. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers and wines on tap and in cans/bottles. The bartenders are very nice, they offer flights for beer or wine, and the brown bag special which is a beer of the bartender's choice for $3. Happy hour is 1-8pm everyday and $2 off drafts."}
{"text":"This place is very cool!!  Younger crowd but pretty slammed for a Thursday night. Beer and wine selection is exceptional. Drafts and bottles!! This would be a great place for a laid back date night. I'm digging it a lot!!"}
{"text":"We had a super time here.  We had the meat and cheese plate.  It was very good.  My husband loves porters and Brian did not disappoint when we asked for recommendations.  He also recommended a really nice Scottish type a amber ale that I really liked.  We finally succumbed to the spicy grilled cheese with pepperoni and sarracha.  I can't remember what else was in it but we shared and really enjoyed it.  The servers were all awesome.  This will definitely be a favorite hangout for us.  Dan, the owner, made a point of coming over before we left.  Thanks for a very enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Love it! Great beer selection (on tap, cans, bottles) friendly staff, box games, card games, board games, and chalkboard walls you can write on... Who could ask for more???
It is a bit loud when busy. Probably due to the small size. Other than that nothing bad to say about the place.
They also have a brown bag surprise beer. The bartender picks a beer for you and puts it in a brown paper bag without you knowing what it is. Taste it then look. Had a couple of those and we loved it."}
{"text":"I didn't expect this place to be as fun as it was! So much beer and wine to choose from at all different price ranges. We went for happy hour and had a great time. Their grilled cheeses are all delicious! Perfect to pair with your drink. Brian was our server and he not only remembered our names but our drinks too as he took care of the many other people there. This place is small and a shoulder to shoulder type place but a very fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Truly the best happy hour in Gilbert!  Awesome wine and beer selection at great prices.  And even if it isn't happy hour, you still have reasonably priced choices.  Great service & an awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Like beer and/or wine? You have to check this place out. It is a small, warm, and friendly atmosphere that's a great place to catch up with friend, or if you just want to try some new beers. Their selection is awesome and even better, their bartenders know the beers and are more than willing to provide suggestions. I had a couple IPA's, the one the bartender suggested was better than the one I picked. I don't drink a lot of wine but suspect the bartenders would be equally friendly and helpful in making a selection. Last thing I will say is, they know how to keep it simple. The menu, five different grilled cheese sandwiches. How perfect is that? I had the fig, prosciutto, and goat cheese - fantastic! I am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to get a beer. They have incredibly friendly bartenders (and owners), the best beer selection around, and an overall great atmosphere. Recommended for meeting up with a friend or two, and if you want to try something different, beer-wise. I wouldn't bring a large group during busy times, as the space is a little tight (cozy), but I do suggest you try it out."}
{"text":"Happy hour until 8pm! How cool is that? There's a huge selection of wine and beer for $3-7, and I can tell you from my experience that the wine pours are generous. The servers are very friendly, and I like the trivia and board games floating around.

The big problem with Whining Pig though is the design. Besides the seats around the bar, there's only one table near the back. The remainder of the seating is against the wall, and who wants to be stuck staring at the wall. Even at the bar, it's difficult to play a game with more than two people in your party since you're not facing each other. I wish there were more high tops like the Arcadia location.

But again, happy hour until 8pm."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a place like this in Gilbert.  Great draft selection, I challenge you to find better.  Knowledgeable bar tenders and just an overall good experience.  Also, they let you bring in outside food!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and fun atmosphere for drinking and playing old school games. Very friendly bartenders- Paninis were delicious and hit the spot for a late afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"The service is great but the beer and whine selection is better! Such a great atmosphere. This is a great place to stop to get drinks. For those of you that got my \"whine\" reference, you get a gold star!!! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I loved this place! Fun and relaxing environment. The beer is selection is HUGE, we tried a flight of IPAs and enjoyed all of them!"}
{"text":"Great local wine and beer bar with many choices whether you're a wine snob or beer buff.  Very friendly staff and nice customers.  I'm actually less than a mile from the original Pig on 16th and Bethany Home and that location has lost it's cool vibe.  Everything from the staff/employees to the music that's played.  Management/owners would be wise improving those areas."}
{"text":"Ok. So if I had reviewed the whining pig after my first visit it would be five stars. The beer and wine list is amazing. Dan and the other bar tenders are really friendly and knowledgable. It is a cool little chill bar. The reason for 4 stars might seem arbitrary, but hear me out. This is truly a bar. Beer and wine only, which is fine but they also serve \"food\". In reality it is a few paninis which is no big deal except for the fact that they are basically cracker size. Literally, two slices of wonder bread, one slice of cheese, a tablespoon of pesto and a couple of tomatoes. After it came out of the panini grill it basically looked like a couple of pieces of toast. For 6 bucks it is a little ridiculous. That being said it is still a great place to hang out. Just wish they would make the food meal size so we don't have to go someplace else first to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!! It is small, but makes up for space with a huge beer selection. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. This will be our new place to grab a beer. As for wine, they are very generous on their pours. If you go here and cannot find something you like, then you should not be drinking.  Food was not available during our visit, but should be available next time. Just a great vibe, good staff.  Highly recommended and the fact happy hour is like 6 hours every day. Go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here once with ma' lady. I kinda forgot what the name of the special I got but basically its the bartenders choice. They put whatever the hell they want into a paper bag and give it to you. My kinda shit. They have games and other weird stuff you can play to keep your mind distracted from the fact you are a booze hungry loser like myself. The staff was chill and cool. They have a huge blackboard you can write on so of course I put my buddy's phone number on it with the title \"for a sensual back rub and maybe sex, call Dustin\". He was never called."}
{"text":"Please don't go here.  Don't pop in to check it out,  just keep driving.  Kinda halfway joking.  This place will be my new favorite place and a much needed awesome taphouse on this side of town.  And it's small,  so please don't ruin my hidden gem to the point where I won't get a seat. Who am I kidding,  I'd just stand in the back corner and enjoy one of the 32 beers on tap,  or their 100+ bottle selection. And if you don't like beer,  what's wrong with you?  But they do have a decent cider and wine selection. There's no way with that amazing review you'd check them out..... so thanks for not going to my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places  in Gilbert. Wish they were bigger! The beer and wine list  is awesome. Can't  go wrong with a grilled cheese. Service is great, and who doesn't  love to play games while drinking!!"}
{"text":"We need more Whining Pigs in the world. Great location, great options of beers, wines, and love the small menu of grilled cheeses (which are DELICIOUS). Even for someone who doesn't eat meat like myself, I was head over heels for the grilled cheese with cream cheese. The variety of games and company in the bar make it so inviting and fun. My fiance and I don't often slow down to enjoy each other's company and relax -- so playing Connect Four over an amazing sour beer suggested by the owner and eating copious amounts of grilled cheese was the perfect unwind date night."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, however it just appears to be another hipster, craft beer hangout.  I will give them credit, they aren't completely IPA focused, which is good.  We didn't order food, but the food we saw being delivered to others around us appeared to be less than stellar. They have old fashioned board games and card games to entertain at the bar.  Other than that, nothing special.  I'm just not all that impressed."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink with friends! Not a huge food selection but what they do is scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place, great atmosphere but the restrooms are disgusting! Toilet, sink and walls are filthy! Please clean the restrooms!"}
{"text":"Truly a cool bar. I am not a craft beer person or a wine expert so I had no idea what to order. I noticed there was an option of a flight and I asked the bartender to choose my beers based off light beers. He did a great job and seemed happy to do it. I'm sure all the other reviews state this, but this place seems to be ALWAYS PACKED! I was not even able to sit at the bar, I sat behind the bar facing the wall which my husband hated. When bars are packed, it's incredibly difficult to squeeze in there and order a drink. I made my presence known from behind the people sitting at the bar, and the guy came up to me and took my order. He also brought our drinks to us instead of setting them on the bar in front of other people's places; same goes for the check. This made the unavailable seating more bearable. I would come here all the time if I knew I could sit at the bar, but facing a chalkboard with a tiny table in front of you just isn't our thing. I wish they wouldn't let children in there as they take up seats and really don't belong in a bar. It's not their fault the bar is so popular but I do suggest them putting a sign up (can even be funny) letting people know that if they leave a seat between them empty to avoid sitting directly next to someone, they are an ass. You could have easily sat 4-6 more people with the empty seats left between people."}
{"text":"Selection: 
About 30 beers on tap. The times I have gone, they have had two on nitro.  Can't go wrong with their beer bottle selection either.

Snack foods like grilled cheese, assorted cheese plates, and an assorted meat plate. 

Customer Service:
Dan is the man. Not only with his beard hypnotize you, but his helpfulness in selecting a beer. You won't go thirsty here, even at their busiest they are very attentive. 

Environment: 
Friendly vibe.

U shaped bar. There are bar stools and place to set your drinks running against the wall. A single table in the back. 

Games galore here: Yahtzee, Break the Ice, Connect 4, and Cards Against Humanity, to name a few."}
{"text":"Only been to the Gilbert location; the owners are genuine, delightful and just like all of their staff, they're brilliant. Beers in abundance, I can always have what I desire, anything from a sour to a stout. They have it all! If your you're hungry they have variations of grilled cheese sandwiches and chips. Beer, wine and great prices and even better/longer happy hour. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing food - Jose, our server was very polite and gave us the best dessert ever! Thanks Jose keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Hands down.. best beer selection, best atmosphere, and flat out best bar staff. Great thing you have here Whining Pig. Nice work!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth all five stars. They have great selection and a great staff who knows exactly how to recommend great drinks. If you're still not sure they'll give you samples too, to help you make up your mind. They have a great, cozy atmosphere and games galore. Definitely a great place to chill"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Totally fun, yummy beer, totally cool staff. Brian was awesome. I'd be in trouble if this was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Traveled to Gilbert for a training and discovered this place on day one. Probably the best brew pub I have every been too. The staff is beyond customer oriented. By the second day they knew all of our names and greeted us like we we're regulars. If you like a good pub gotta try this place"}
{"text":"If I was to start my own business Whining Pig is exactly what it would be.. A divey craft beer joint. Whining Pig is small but is loaded with selection, as they offer hundreds of craft beers to select from both on draft and in cans/bottles. They also have a wide selection of wines to choose from if craft beer isn't your thing. What I like most about this place is the bar tenders are extremely helpful and patient and are always willing to give a suggestion if you cant make up your mind. Overall best bar I have been to in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Their menu has many different options, it was hard to choose! We had a couple of their drinks, a raspberry drop & some blood orange one, and they were AMAZING. Every staff member we ran into were super nice. I'd definitely recommend coming here for lunch or even dinner."}
{"text":"The guys were amazing at setting me up with something I'd enjoy since I'm not a beer girl. I got three different drinks that were great and just to my tastes. Trust them when they suggest something they were right on, samples helped. The were fun to talk with and the games at the bar made it even more fun. 
Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of micro beers.  Many west coast breweries Ive never heard of.  Menu is limited to either antipasto cheese boards or a variety of grilled cheese sandwiches.  The grilled ham and cheese filled the void and helped soak up some of the alcohol."}
{"text":"This is the best craft beer place I have been to in Arizona so far. They have an amazing selection and reasonable prices, especially during happy hour that runs until 8pm."}
{"text":"This place is different than any place we have gone to before.  It is very small.   it is not a sports bar.  They have games you can play by yourself or with others.  They have a huge menu for beer and wine.  They do have beer on tap.  There is music playing and people draw or write messages on the wall.
The bar top is made out of pennies'.
Their food is limited to grilled cheese sandwiches.  We had the ham and cheese, nothing fancy, but it was a good grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  And they come with Ruffles potato chips, they also have brownies.
Dan, who is the owner or manager can answer any questions you have, he is very knowledgeable about their product.  He is supper nice and enjoys working in customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm not much of a drinker, but I still enjoyed myself.  The beer and wine selections are great.  A full wall listing all the types of beers and wines they have.  They only have grilled cheese sandwiches (which I haven't tried yet),  but the meat and cheese plate is awesome. They also have awesome brownies. 

This place is great and has a great atmosphere and awesome music.  They even have vintage board games on the bars and in the corner to choose from. Even if you don't drink much (or at all),  this is still a great place to go. I loved it and will return again."}
{"text":"Cool place lots of options to drink, nice staff and cool bar top. Older crowd but that can be a cool thing. Also there is a 24 hour Mexican place in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I went to The Whining Pig twice in one week after my first visit. Loved it. The first time was on a Saturday night and it was packed (it doesn't take much, this place is tiny). But a couple was leaving and let us have their seats. I was impressed by the wide beer selection written in chalk on the board. They have wine as well and they serve some food, it looked like grilled cheese and charcuterie, but we didn't eat on either visit. The beers were fantastic though. The two bartenders were both men with beards and they were very friendly and helpful. This place has many games laying around to play like Rock em Sock em, Cards Against Humanity, Trivial Pursuit, and many more. I told a friend about this place and we came back on Thursday, five days later. We found seats immediately and had a great time. My only concern was that there was a super drunk couple that came in that literally stumbled in that I felt should not have been served. The guy kept leaning into me despite me continually moving my bar stool. It was a young girl bartending that night, she was efficient but not as friendly. I will definitely be back regardless!"}
{"text":"New favorite place! The prices are awesome, the selection is even better and the bartenders are the best. Their happy hour can't be beat! We will be back many many times."}
{"text":"We went here during the weekend and had a great time. Great selection of beer and wines. Home made brownie was excellent. Glad this is near home as I'll be stopping in. Bartender was good too."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Small place, so get there early to get a seat at the bar.  Love the concept of writing on the giant wall with chalk.  All they serve for food are gourmet grilled sandwiches, but the idea is great.  Come for the hundred beer selection.  The guys who work here are so incredibly friendly.  My favorite local bar!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The 3 of us really liked the large selection they had and how the menu wad color coded for which type of drink. They also have games you can play and one of the bartenders brought us a carafe of water, which is great so we didn't have to keep waiting at the bar. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So happy to find a great beer and wine bar like this. The beer and wine selection is fantastic. The grilled cheese sandwiches were delicious and flavorful. The meat and cheese plate was also tasty. The staff was friendly and attentive. I love the small pub feel of the joint. I will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a great drink and relax. Good atmosphere and it's cozy.  They had a lot of different games to play and a ton of options for their drink selections. If you're looking to chill and calm down for the day... this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to all three valley locations and I love the consistency; they know what works and they stick with it! There's a massive selection of great beers and fine wines for any taste. The seating is limited so I wouldn't suggest coming in with a big group, but they have plenty of games to keep guests busy. The service is always super friendly and employees are happy to provide recommendations based on your tastes. The food menu is extremely limited- 5 different grilled cheese options and a meat/cheese tray, so eat beforehand if you're a picky eater."}
{"text":"Loved this bar!  I wish we had one in the Rhode Island area.  The beer selection is crazy huge.  I tried a sour beer for the first time...totally hooked.  They have every game and them some around the bar to play.  The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable.  I will definately be coming back each time I visit AZ. A definate 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal place, Dan the owner is seriously, one of the most intelligent human beings we've ever met! He'll remember your name from the day he meets you & he can tell you ANYTHING about the 31 taps & 125+ beers & 40+ wines - he's a fascinating dude!

And that Bartender Tiffany is the Bomb-Dignity! So sweet & just a fun chickie....be sure to acknowledge her pretty eyes! 

The 5* reviews are legit, this place is the real deal, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All the staff is amazing. Great beer choices. Can bring your own food or they have grilled cheese options if looking for something small."}
{"text":"Finally someone had the brilliant idea of opening a tap house in Gilbert. If you like beer and wine and a good time you've gotta check it out! Already love this place, can't wait to make my way back."}
{"text":"5-star bar all the way around. Don't expect to come here for a beer and burger. The beer? Yeah...they got that. Lots of it...and good ones. Burger? If you count stale grilled cheese as a burger then sure. What makes this place so great is it's a place you can come in by yourself and leave with a few new friends. Not sure why it's at the location it is...kind of wish it was closer to civilization."}
{"text":"Brian was an amazing bartender!! He's always personable and very attentive to all guests in the bar! Always a great experience with him serving us! Also Matt had amazing customer service and made the atmosphere very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Very small place but nice has a large bar with many  fun games as in connect 4 , many trivia games,
Yahtzee, hangman,dominos , etc ... over 5o beers and wines... place has   great  bartenders....meat and cheese plates and wonderful cheese sandwiches   And brownies... 

Had to redo my review and bring it down. We always get the chocolate peanut butter Oreo brownie and it's always amazing tonight it was very dry.. as I handed the credit card to the bartender to pay he looked at them and said yeah they don't look so fresh ha ha Ha. Hmmmmmmm yeah I don't think it's as funny as he does and it's not like they are cheap but not the point .. not sure if we will be back nor the people next to us that we maybe bullied into trying them thinking it would be awesome"}
{"text":"I just happened to see the signage as I came into the strip mall couple of weeks ago and put it on the list for our next happy hour with friends (word of mouth will be important to this location because its not a very visible spit). The server asked our party of four our names, shook our hands as she greeted us and did an amazing job remembering and using them the rest of the night - and it just wasn't our party - she remembered everyone!  We came at peak happy hour - fun atmosphere (bit divey) but not a lot of room.  We came hungry and order the meat and cheese board - it came as advertised....meat and cheese.  Few more crackers and some fresh fruit would make this a crowd pleaser.  The establishment is beer, wine and a simple board or paninis.  Ice is considered a \"prepared food\" and they dont have ice (even for water).  Perfect place to meet up for a small batch brew and move on."}
{"text":"Don't come here to eat! (Although I wish they had a real food menu). The service is top notch. The bartenders were very tentative to myself and my friends. We ordered a meat and cheese board it was good enough for the occasion but don't come here hungry unless you want to enlighten your inner child with one of their grilled cheeses. The selection of beer and even wine is amazing! They have a few board games and the chalk board wall = my favorite feature (after a few drinks)."}
{"text":"Ok...So everyone has noted all the great beer, wine and atmosphere. Really could use some more food. The \"grilled cheese\" options are too limited and little pricey as well. I was disappointed to discover they don't even make them there. All they do is stick them in a pannini press and heat 'em up. Bolster the menu a bit, and I am more likely to stay longer and drink more."}
{"text":"Still a favorite place to have a beer, meet friends, and enjoy conversation with the staff."}
{"text":"Was here with my friend here last night. They have countless options for draft beers and wine. My personal favorite is DogFish SeaQuenchAle, tasted delicious (made with lime peel, black lime and sea salt). Also tried Green blahblah Blonde, really smooth and yummy. 

Totally recommend this place for a nice evening beer hangout/chat."}
{"text":"I came here a while back and found the entire place too cramped. My hubby is 6'4 and I'm no dainty flower so sitting at the low bar was just awkward. We stayed for one beer and left. It just didn't have the vibe I was hoping for and nobody was particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Great time here, always leave happy, could be the beer but I think it's the atmosphere  
If you can't handle craft beers or good wines don't bother, tell them Stinky sent ya"}
{"text":"Reminds me of bars in the midwest. Its not a huge place. It has a cool vibe. I found bartenders and everyone sitting around very friendly. They have a huge beer and wine selection. Lots of old school games to play. Grilled cheese or cheese boards are your options for food as they do not have a big kitchen space. Really cool vibe!"}
{"text":"Such a unique place! This is a perfect date night bar. We loved the atmosphere and the bartenders were super friendly. Also a huge fan of the extended happy hour! Loved it."}
{"text":"The Whining Pig opened in our area, Gilbert, 2 weeks ago and we feel so lucky. My husband is a beer enthusiast and has sampled, made, and read about many types of beer. This is the perfect place to not only have a diverse beer experience but is also a great place to socialize. Knowledgable, attentive and friendly staff and great clientele. The grilled cheese menu is tasty and makes for a great snack to share while sipping some beer. I noticed plenty of people enjoying wine as well."}
{"text":"Great variety of beer. My wife and I ordered the meat and cheese tray and got sick that same day."}
{"text":"Literally the best bar I've ever been to. Clayton and Dan are amazing. The beer selection is amazing. Just amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. To start the beer list is extensive and well laid out. Not much of a menu (grilled cheese is about the extent) but I am not here for the food! This is great spot for happy hour, before dinner, or after dinner drinks. The rectangular bar and many table and board games promote a very social atmosphere. It is an easy place to strike up conversation and the bartenders have great banter as well! I like that the barkeeps introduce themselves to every customer, very friendly welcoming. The brown bag special is cool- a \"mystery beer\" in a brown bag for $3- really good value after I tried a few new, pricey ones off the list. I could see it getting overcrowded, but if you hit it at the right time and get a seat, settle in and enjoy this new Gilbert gem."}
{"text":"Epic beer selection!  

There are a couple of bars in the area that have a few of craft beer taps but it's mainly Four Peaks and Lagunitas.  So when I heard there was a new Whining Pig in Gilbert, I got super excited!  True to the Pig form they're slinging a wide variety of high gravity beers, fun bar top games and grilled cheese bar snacks.  The bartenders are super friendly and so are the patrons.  You just can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not much of a drinker and I am most definitely a \"lightweight\" when it comes to drinking. I also have this gluten allergy which makes drinking beer not an option. I was impressed with how a bartender immediately came over and introduced himself to us and offered suggestions based on our preferences. We were then able to stay at the bar and play games and interact with others. I had so much fun. We stayed there for nearly 2 hours. I'd recommend this bar to anyone. Thanks for a good time!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in here on the night of the NFL draft a week or so ago.  I'm definitely not a craft beer guy,I really just stick to lagers, so I knew it wouldn't be the type of place Id fall in love with. I must say though that for those of you who do enjoy craft beers their menu is very extensive. They have a very large chalkboard with what seems like hundreds of beers listed, so if that's your thing go give this place a shot. I knew they wouldn't have a large menu as food is not their main concern,however when I asked for a menu I was told they were out of food altogether. They do however allow you to order or pick up food from somewhere else and bring it in. I wasn't extremely hungry so it wasn't that big a deal. I got a beer,the closest thing to a lager they had,although I don't remember what I got (like I said it was the night of the NFL draft,it wasn't my first of the night! )  My wife ordered a red blend and they were actually out of it too,but they did find a good alternative. The place has a great atmosphere,and even a bunch of old school games to play laying around so you can easily entertain yourself. We played Battleship,which I probably hadn't played since I was in elementary school.  Again not a craft beer guy,but definitely will return for drinks and games :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a great low key spot with a fantastic choice of beverages! The people are friendly and there is no shortage of great games to play if you want. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other locations around the valley, and this one was my favorite. Great atmosphere and the drinks are always the best prices."}
{"text":"We had such a blast here! I have visited the Whining Pig in uptown and love that location as well. I particularly enjoy the games available for everyone to play. I feel as though it provides fun with friends or can even become an icebreaker to meet new people at any given opportunity. 

I was a little bummed they were out of one of their panini but, they must be that good because we did arrive rather later in the evening. The staff was very friendly and pretty chill which made for a pretty chill environment. 

I had a few of their brown bag options at a discount because the wide variety of beer selection leaves me scratching my head with 2 empty hands... easily solved with a \"surprise me\" type of option which is left up to the server. 

They also didn't seem to mind all the doodling on the chalk board, I just can't help myself when there is a chalkboard and chalk to doodle on. 

All and all, I am stone things are coming out to the east side of the valley because it's been rather unamusing until the past year or so. It's a nice small joint to enjoy a few beers and just chill."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Such a cool atmosphere and soooo many options of drinks to choose from. If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"OMG such a FUN bar!!! Great atmosphere, great owners, great staff! It's homey and has a great local bar feel. The grilled cheeses are AMAZING! and they have a huge wine and beer selection that the staff is well educated on. Definitely a fun place to go!"}
{"text":"Visiting Fam in AZ and found this local Gem! Crazy good wine menu and even crazier beer menu. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff plus old school board games. If you are a wine/beer lover this place is worth a visit. Oh and if you get hungry there is a dope grilled cheese menu."}
{"text":"Been dying to try their other location on Bethany home road, you can imagine my excitement to see that they came all the way out to my neck of the woods. This place is fantastic and has a happy hour that is better than any other places around! Be warned it is beer and wine only and no liquor is sold here but seriously this place is worth it. Literally hundreds of beers and a great group of bartenders. Will be back again and again. Word to the wise this place is pretty small so get there early."}
{"text":"Found this within walking distance of my house. Stopped by for a drink and fell in love with the place immediately. I was greeted right away by Clayton in a manner completely devoid of attitude as he explained the menu. Wide choice of wines and beers with draft and bottles. Great atmosphere! And I'm thrilled I found such a cool neighborhood bar. I want to bring my friends"}
{"text":"Went there tonight by accident, just happened to notice the place. They have great beer and wine selection and happy hour til 8pm. Nice people running the bar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Gilbert. The bartenders are always very friendly. My bartender the other night recommended a couple of wines and allowed me to taste them. I love how their menu is written on the walks with all of their specialty brews. The atmosphere is fun with good music and a lot of games to play. My only complaints are that it is very small and they only have a meat plate and grilled cheese for food."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere with an excellent selection of drinks!! Cool place for a casual date or just catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Not a lot of games, so don't go expecting a Cobra-like experience... very chill, though, with a cider that tastes like grape juice!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!! I LOVED this place. It took me a minute to realize that the beers were color coded (purple =sour) and also, there were some food options on the opposite side of the wall that i didnt notice until we sat on the other side  (wall) of the bar. Pesto grilled cheese and charcuterie board weren't that great but we didn't go there to eat and the beer selection made up for that"}
{"text":"My wife and I spent a couple of hours here last night enjoying a few items from their extensive draft beer selection while discussing the nuances and intricacies of daily life. Dan, proprietor of the establishment, was friendly and very knowledgeable about the entire menu of libations. He took the time to talk to us about the constantly rotating list of beer and wine, while injecting a hearty dose of humor into the mix. Though it was our first time there, we felt welcomed and were very comfortable. It was evident that Dan really loves what he does and has fun doing it. 

Food options are sparse, and we did not try any, but what we saw looked delicious. Bottom line, if you are looking for a super chill local hangout and love beer and wine, look no further than the Pig."}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of both draft beer, bottles/cans, and even wine!  Happy hour is 3-8.....long!  Don't come for the food (need more nosh style choices) but stay for the beer!  Owners are friendly and bar top games are entertaining."}
{"text":"Huge variety of craft beers for everyone. I'm not a big craft beer person since I don't drink on a daily/weekly basis, but my brother in law was visiting for the holidays so I wanted to take him since he loves craft beers. They let me try a sample before getting a glass which is awesome. I did like their beer recommendation. We also tried all of the sandwiches since there were 3 in our party and were surprised that they all tasted very good! Would definitely go again for sure. The atmosphere was nice and laid back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and a large variety of beers and wines. We have been here 3 weekends in a row.  The Danke Fruit from Tombstone Brewery is really good you have to try it! Dan thanks to you and your employees for making everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"This bar is definitely a hidden gem. My husband and I went on a Friday night and it was crazy packed. It took us about 15 minutes to get the guys attention to order our drinks so that was a bit frustrating but once we had our drinks, we enjoyed ourselves. My husband tried four different IPAs and I had the port wine. We wanted to try a couple of the grilled cheeses but we didn't want to waste more time trying to get their attention so we went across the street and ate at High Tide instead. We wish there was a little section of the bar JUST for ordering drinks/food since no one comes around to take orders and it's a pain to get anyone's attention. I like this place but definitely would not come back on a busy weeknight/end."}
{"text":"Well...I love the atmosphere,  however my husband and I recently visited this establishment and I am left feeling extremely disappointed. My husband is the most kind hearted, friendly ( sometimes overly friendly)  person one could ever have the chance of  meeting. Anyhow a disagreement between he, and another young man whom I will not call a gentleman acured and my husband was the one who was asked to leave and even threatened by this dude that used to work at world of beers. I don't even remember his name, As he is an after thought and a Neanderthal. Even after my husband shook this guys hand and apologized for something he wasn't even guilty of , As he still doesn't know what the actual disagreement that acured was about, he was treated not only with complete disrespect, but hostility, and threatened with violence. We are not violent people and have never experienced such an experience as we experienced tonight. Brian is  wonderful, however it shows the character of a person that sits back and allows this type of behavior from his employees. Sad... sad...sad...I feel like I should have punched this guy in the face, but it is not in my nature to physically harm another human being. On another note...the live music was fantastic and I really enjoyed it. To bad the night ended on a negative note."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Great selection of drinks and amazing atmosphere.  The whole bar was joining in on the fun.  Never have I seen and entire bar play never have I ever!   Fantastic time!  Bartenders were great and knowledgeable about their products"}
{"text":"Laid back cool joint where you can bring your own food. Fun throwback games keep the entertainment and conversation going along with the awesome owner Dan who loves what he's pushin!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to be for sure but they lost me as a customer. Every time I come in, there's no where to sit or stand. The place is too small and too packed. Douchebags telling me I can't stand in a certain spot because that's their spot. I would rather not return and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice little joint with a great selection of beer and wine. Went on a weekday and was very nice and quiet. Staff was friendly and prompt. Check it out."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place. Literally the only downside is that it is so small, but that just gives you a reason to put down you phone, stop hunting Pokemon, and make a friend. The beer selection is on point. I am a avid IPA lover and this place has a great selection and they update their list very frequently. The owners are amazing guys and have a great knowledge of beer. Happy Hour is 3-8 Monday - Friday and they have $3 Brown Bag Beer specials. A few smaller food items, but as far as I can tell the people who have ordered them love them. Even if you do not like beer, which confuses me, they have a good selection of wines and even beer that can hydrate you including Coors Light, Blue Moon, and Stella. Haha. In all seriousness, this place is great and I am so glad Gilbert finally has a Craft Beer bar like this."}
{"text":"Do you like good beer/wine?
Do you like friendly people?
Do you like chill music?
Do you like Vintage/Hipster deco?
Do you like old games?
Well this place is for you! 
We went couple times to this place and it's a lot of fun!
Everybody talked together, we drew on the giant chalkboard, we tried new beer that we never heard before, until Dan & Clayton recommend us to try, we played \"Connect 4\". 
After spending the evening over there you just want to go back the next day. 
Thank you for those great evenings and see you very soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and drink some really good beer. The staff are excellent too....they actually shake your hand to meet you and they remember you by name! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on yelp and decided to hit it before the ASU baseball game.  Wow.  31 beers on tap.  Great service and an outstanding meat and cheese plate.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"They have the largest craft beer selection I have ever seen! A definite must try if you're a beer fan, this place will not disappoint you! Loved that they had numerous sour beers to choose from."}
{"text":"We wanted to try their location in Phoenix for a long time, but unfortunately we lived too far away. 
So we were really happy that they opened a location close to us, we went there one week after their grand opening.
The whole staff of Cuisine and Wine Bistro on a night off, came and partied there ! We had a little chat with the girlfriend's owner, who recognized us when we got in.
The decoration is great, the bar is made with pennies, which is pretty cool (3500 pennies if I counted correctly!) 
We trust Dan and Clayton for each orders of beers. 
Their concept is perfect, we wish them all the luck in the world!"}
{"text":"Nice place, very low key.  Great selection of beer on tap and at a very reasonable prices. Great place to stop and enjoy a cold brew.  Owner is very friendly and accommodating.  Great addition to area."}
{"text":"Think Cheers but with crazy awesome beer selection and 15 tap wines for balance. Dan is the man and knows his beers! Limited food options but there is scientific proof that there is food value in beer but no beer value in food, so I'm voting they got their focus on target. A must try in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Asked the bartenders some questions about local beers and were abruptly answered with an \"I don't know \" response. I felt they were just down right RUDE!!"}
{"text":"Great beer and better service!!  Awesome people, concept and beer. Oops did I say that already!  

They seriously have all kinds of really great beer. I am an IPA guy and they had many draught (31 total about 8-10 IPA) and bottle choices. 

Last but most important was the service and atmosphere. Aidan explained the concept and the different types of beers. However, everyone we talked to was very helpful and very friendly.  Plus we met some very nice people (Jackie and Sean) at the bar. 

Lastly I must thank John who recommended this place to us.  We will be back!!  Both Huygens and enthusiastic humans us from us."}
{"text":"We met a friend over at the Whining Pig. It was set up to socialize , drink, and play games . We also met one of the owners Katy and got to pet her puppy. Just a fun spot to grab something new to try . I had a Belgium Beer that was made with raspberries. It seems like they have hundreds of beers and wines. New to the area, great place to meet new friends. Looking forward to the next time we go back. Can't wait to try one of their grill cheese creations. Seem to be a place of a lot of good energy ."}
{"text":"Very personable staff.  Tiffany is one of the most kind hearted individuals and makes you feel welcome the second you walk in.  

The entire bar has a very hipster vibe with card/board games literally ALL over the place! They have a gigantic chalkboard along one wall for people to write whatever they want and has some very cute messages. 

I'd give it a full 5 stars if they had more beer on tap. Most of their beers are in bottles/cans which I have no problem with other than not being able to sample some of the craft beers I have no idea of.  Other than that the experience is awesome and I'm looking forward to going to their other location off Bethany and the 51! Whoop whoop!"}
{"text":"This place is super close to my house and has such a good vibe. I always enjoy going there and each time I have met a new person there that turns out to be someone worthwhile. The people, beer, and prices are great. Sometimes it can be crowded but it's always worth it. I'm glad it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cool place / small but fun - great happy hour! Bartenders very nice and friendly- love the music and crowd is always interesting ! ."}
{"text":"Cool bar! Fun vibe and a ton of beers!!!! Amazing selection of beer! Not really a lot of food options but the selection of beer makes up for it! They have fun games to play at the bar like connect 4, trivial pursuit, Simon says and a bunch of others. Had live music when I was there that was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, plenty to choose from. You defenitely come for the beer and not for the food."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place on two separate occasions. The first was on a Thursday night and the place was so packed I couldn't even get a bartenders attention so I decided to leave. The second time was less busy on a Monday night and we were able to order some wine. The staff did take longer than expected to acknowledge us but once they did we were able to get good service. They only offer grilled cheese combos and a charcuterie board and the charcuterie board was sold out when we went. The grilled cheese was decent but I would probably stick to just drinks next time around. The great thing about this place is the happy hour is extended until 8pm, this gives us late workers time to make it to a bar for a drink after a long day of work. This place is small but has a good variety of drink choices."}
{"text":"Great new place. Fantastic beer and wine selection. Fun atmosphere, nice Owner's and lots of games. Reminds me of the small breweries in Flagstaff. Great fine."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our evening here. Lots of beer and wine to choose from and we appreciated the recommendations. We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar and were able to enjoy conversations without it being too loud, but it is a very small place so I wouldn't recommend going during a busy time. If you don't get a seat at the bar, then you have to sit along the wall which does not leave a lot of room for group socializing or to spread out. I did the Yelp check in for a free brownie but they were all out so we were offered a Little Debbie snack instead. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great beer, wine, and atmosphere. To top it off Dan and Clayton are very knowledgeable and good dudes to bot."}
{"text":"Really a cool place to come hang out. Bring a date or bring the crew.  A great little place to hang out with friends.  
Beer selection is likely one of the best in Gilbert. 

The staff was very friendly and interactive, and are happy to answer any question you have. 

The only thing I might suggest, a little bit more of a substantial food menu.  The various twists on grill cheese, while very tasty, would hardly qualify as more than a snack.   Even a snack mix or bowl of nuts would help."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection , love the happy hours, wish they'd turn off the muted talking about sports shows, small but tasty grilled cheese selection hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Friendly atmosphere.  Bartenders there actually remember your names and is knowledgeable about the beer selection.  Bar seems too good for Gilbert but glad to have it!"}
{"text":"Loved all the beer and wine choices. Lots of great options. Great place for locals to hang out. Happy hour prices are amazing."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer or wine, but not necessarily for food.  Just a few cheese sandwiches $6 and a meat and cheese plate $13.   The peanut butter chocolate chip brownie is to die for though!  Yummy. Beer and wines galore!   Staff is excellent and friendly.  Beers a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Service is always great. They really know beer l. If you are a beer snob like me, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best happy hour ever! Only beer and wine on the menu but so many choices of both.  The service is great,  they ask you your name and really try to remember you especially if you're a frequent visitor.  You can bring in your own food and they have games to play.  They have a few food items like specialty grilled cheeses.  Only downfall is there's not a lot of seating on the weekends"}
{"text":"Super amazing bar!! Love the vibes and always get treated with the best hospitality! Blue and Matt were awesome tonight! Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"The beer list is extensive and reasonably priced given the high quality of the taps. The wine offerings were also pretty extensive but I didn't try any of those. The atmosphere is perfect for happy hour - laid back and friendly. Matt was tending bar the first time I went and he definitely added to the good vibe of the place. He was very personable with everyone in the room. I didn't eat so can't comment one way or the other on the food. Well worth a visit if you're anywhere near the area."}
{"text":"Love all their locations but having a Whining Pig in Gilbert is extra sweet. Wonderful selection of beer AND wine. Great happy hour and warm, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Kevin and Tiffany will be straight with you. Go on Facebook and see the beers they have. Don't forget the grilled cheese different flavors and peanut butter brownies they have.  OMG awesome. You just want this to be your living room.Great job guys."}
{"text":"Yes!!!!! This is my go-to place to get a drink on the weekend and it's so close to my house! 

This bar has a great rustic feel to it, and is so tucked away in the corner of the Kohl's complex that I didn't even know it existed until someone told me about it.  

I absolutely love their drink selections! If you are into IPAs and Stouts, this place will definitely satisfy your drinking needs. Their drink selection is displayed on a huge chalkboard in the back where it's beautifully color coordinated to show you their stouts, ales, IPAs, etc. oh they also have wines too if you're into that stuff. 

Overall the best thing was the service. The bartenders really are pretty chill! I went first with my wife and told the bartender that we'd be coming more often now, and the next time we came in, he actually remembered both our names! Pretty cool and pretty genuine. 

Also if you get a chance to munch on a little snack, they have amazing homemade grilled cheeses! I got the pesto and sundried tomato one, and it was awesome! We also got a meat and cheese board which was fun to share with friends, and when we ran out of crackers and still have a lot of meats and cheeses left, our bartender literally gave us a huge amount of extra crackers! Such nice service! 

Tips
1) Try a grilled cheese sandwich but don't come starving. These are bite size sandwiches 
2) it's a small space, so you just might have to find a spot anywhere available 
3) know your bartender! They're cool! I was helped by a guy named Brian, he was super chill"}
{"text":"Cool place, first time in was last night.
Delightful ambience and elegant lighting.
Bartenders were pleasant & knowledgeable.
The bar offers nearly three dozen taps, well over 100 beers by the bottle and can, and about 50 wine selections. The Whining Pig bar has an ever-changing selection of beer and wine.
Ask for a brown bag beer! It's a \"surprise\" cold canned beer selected by your server, nestle in a brown bag & served to you! Fun concept! 
Didn't try their food menu. While The Whining Pig's drink selection may be extensive, the food options are pretty limited. For the wine menu they pair a meat and cheese plate and suggest a sweet peanut butter brownie for dessert.
We didn't see this, but supposedly they provide plenty of board games to keep you entertained while you drink! We had great conversation & tried some great new drafts! We will be back.."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat-this isn't it.  They pretty much just have a variety of grilled cheese sandwiches available.  They did have an extensive draft list but sadly didnt have too many local beers. The draft prices were fine but they had very high prices on the bottles and cans-$6 for a can of beer like Sun Up Trooper IPA is crazy or for a Sierra Nevada."}
{"text":"The only reason why I drink everyday is because of Fanny... this place makes you feel like family the first time you walk in the door. If you have the chance of Fanny to grace your presents while you are there you will leave floating and loved. No to mention the selection if you can't decide they will do it for you like they had they're first beer with you."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night.  Really enjoyed ourselves.  HUGE beer selection, nice atmosphere, and fun games to play.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Highly recommend....."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience! Bartenders were friendly and quick. Awesome beer selection and the meat and cheese tray was great! Good selection of meats, cheeses, nuts and fruit. We will be back-- frequently!"}
{"text":"I went to The Whining Pig for the first time Friday night but it will definitely not be my last. Dan and the staff was extremely friendly, even comical. The mozzarella with pesto and sun dried tomatoes panini was delicious and the drinks were reasonably priced. And happy hour until 8pm was a bonus!!  If you want extra entertainment with your food and drinks, play any of the vintage games. Be sure to stop by this fun, eclectic new bar. You'll love it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go, the beers are always rotating so I always get to try new beers. The variety of beers and wine is crazy. You can always find something you want and the service is always great, anyone working here is always happy to help serve you and find a drink that you love."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Whining Pig for weeks. So glad we went. They have a fantastic craft beer selection (31 on tap plus bottles) and a pretty good wine selection, too. Service was great even though it was packed. Happy hour deals were awesome, too.

And the games. SO MANY GAMES. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite spot when living in Gilbert. Always has excellent customer service and AWESOME happy hour! And the selection.... wow! It was the only place that didn't feel like you were living in Gilbert, that we found when temporarily living there! Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"It is amazing here! The service is the best you will find. There are hundreds of beers and wine to choose from. The also have games like connect 4 and trivia cards all around the place. It's not a big place but it's perfect. We have been in several times and each time has been great. They only have grilled cheese for food-- the last time we were in they had added a meat and cheese board but that is all there is for food. We don't mind that at all because the place has such a fun atmosphere! Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. Bar tenders are absolutely awesome and know their beers. They have like a 60 beer selection. Happy hour is super awesome. The place and location is so perfect as well. I'd give a 6 if I could. Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by.  The staff is very friendly and knowable about the beer and wine.  They don't serve food but you are welcome to bring your our food."}
{"text":"Great place, nice, comfortable and fun neighborhood bar.  Dan is very attentive and personable, he actually gets to know you and your tastes.  Gotta try the brown bag special.  Thanks for the great recommendation of wine from my wacky description.  Board game spread throughout, constantly rotating taps that are different than the norm."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's small and simple but plenty of beers to choose from. They have games too which is cool. It's small and gets busy, but they are really good with keeping up!"}
{"text":"Great selection and awesome bartenders! Will definitely be back soon. Happy Hour from 3-8 is amazing, and the pricing is excellent. Highly recommended to any craft beer fans and they also have 50 wines ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Whining Pig! This is quickly becoming my favorite spot in Gilbert - which is important because it is close to home and I will be visiting frequently! 

This last visit I came with five others and we all sat up against the chalkboard and played board games while sipping on beer and wine. Although it is a very small space it was still big enough for each of us to feel comfortable and have an amazing time! Try it out but don't wait around for a big spot, you'll get lucky for a few chairs or else you'll be standing. 

I've been here twice now and each time I end up staying much longer than anticipated because the drink selections, games and atmosphere. I love the chill dive vibe, giving off a very comfortable and throwback feel. I feel like a kid again with the benefits of being an adult. I already can't wait to go back!

If you're looking for something that isn't as busy as Downtown Gilbert, has a great variety of drink options (beer/wine) and has a lot of character - this is going to quickly become your favorite spot too!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I can't believe how good the beer selection is. Bring it on! Don't miss the pig..."}
{"text":"This place was packed and we had excellent service. They have a very generous happy hour and almost overwhelming beer selection. Everybody there seemed like they were having a great time, I know we did!"}
{"text":"We are excited to have found this bar! Tiffany at the bar was extremely friendly and helpful. She had incredible knowledge of all the beers and wines we asked about. The beer tap & wine list updates frequently. We loved the Huss Juicy Fruit beer!  She also introduced me to a delicious Sauvignon Blanc that wasn't on the menu yet. Plenty of fun board games to play. Great local neighborhood bar and always has a fun crowd. Open late!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Read about it on Yelp for a while, finally decided to give it a go last night. Did not disappoint! Fabulous friendly atmosphere; personal laid back service; clientele were real people,not just a young party crowd. Happy hour lasts until 8; great brews, good wine; delicious grilled cheese (try the one with sirachi!). So glad we stopped in; ending up staying a couple hours!  Will definitely be back; I can see this being our go-to place for HH. Brilliant business plan, great location, excellent service.  Hats off to you guys!"}
{"text":"Great little place for craft beer drinkers, amazing selection of beers, there is a small food menu, and it's excellent but it's snacks.  The staff is all fantastic! We had Tiffany as a bartender and she was was really friendly and knowledgeable about the beers, made great recommendations and even remembered our names all night.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  They also have games for you to play if you wish!"}
{"text":"Best craft beer joint in Gilbert. Huge selection. Dun knowledgable staff. Tiffany is amazing. Whatever style you like you're in business.  The tap list is extensive and the bottle list is seemingly endless."}
{"text":"Beer/Wine selection was great but staff was very rude. Horrible customer service. A friend was mocked by the bartender for not liking the Sangria and then the other bartenders asked what happened and they proceed to roll their eyes. Right in front of us! Very smug attitudes."}
{"text":"Considering that we immediately felt like the oldest people in this place, it immediately felt very welcoming. It smelled like a coffee shop despite being a bar.  I mean it really smelt good. The wall of drinks was very overwhelming and when I finally threw up my hands and asked the bartender how to decipher thing, it really got fun. Tiffany we very friendly and quickly explained how things were organized and gave some suggestions based on our tastes. I'm an IPA guy but was on a wine kick tonight and she shed light on some pinot grigios that might work. Got a few tastes and picked a nice screw top blend. My wife ordered and apricot beer and I was surprised that it was inappropriate can but there's nothing that says that all beers are on tap so what's the big deal. Tiffany treated us like the only people in the place despite it being packed, and no, we dont reek of money and rolled up in our Altima. I found a Yelp check in promo and when I showed it to her she was super cool (I've actually had servers get pissed when I show them a Yelp coupon). We only stayed about an hour but we love this place. Our favorite tepanyaki place is right next door, sprouts is right there and a cool Italian joint is right there as well. After a nice Italian dinner we could have ju se t gone home but I'm glad we stopped to check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. Great service, really great. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and that brownie. Oh, hell with it. Their little panini sammies were tasty and a good size too. Theirs is an awesome assortment of draft beers and wines - really huge flavorful choices. It's cozy in here, and the restrooms were clean!!! I loved the conversation, and the vibe is just right. I'll be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a new favorite date night spot. Great selections of wine and beer with very helpful staff. Informal and fun atmosphere, with an open chalkboard, lots of little games to play and a couple of TVs. The food is light fare and tasty. Wonderful place to just unwind and relax."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. It's a bit hipstery, but the two guys who own it were really cool, helpful, and knowledgeable. They have an amazing selection of draft and bottled/canned beer. There are 2-3 nitro taps. I think there's a huge wine(?) selection, but I don't pay much attention to that. They also serve a few options of grilled cheese.

Pretty much all of the seating is bar seating, so not a great place for a meeting. I think there's only one real table. Place opens at 3pm, and the Friday I was there, it was packed by 4-ish.

Unlike Hertz, who totally sucks, this place was fast, friendly, and an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for the first time recently and am so glad I did! The bartenders and super knowledgeable about all the beer and wine they carry (which is A LOT). They have an amazingly big selection for both beer and wine and it's all very reasonably priced, even the rare times when it's not happy hour! We also tried their fig & prosciutto grilled cheese and it was delish! There's a ton of fun little games to play while you're hanging out too. I wish there were more places like this in Gilbert! It has a lot of personality and is very friendly, we will definitely come back next time hubby & I have a date night (because note: not kid friendly! Which is a-ok with me ;) )"}
