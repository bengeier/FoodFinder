{"text":"I have eaten here many times and it is always so good. The noodle dishes are soooo good my favorites are the pad zu and pad thi they are both my absolute favorite things to get. When u go there ask for the server leilani because she is great! She is sooooo nice and she makes great recommendations I also love how clean and tidy they keep the restraunt"}
{"text":"Awful salty, chicken with unfresh aftertaste, lousy service  Never again.  Used to be good but went downhill quick after they RAISED the prices."}
{"text":"By some of the reviews i read, I was expecting too much. The food was good, but average, & priced a little high for portion size. My husband had barbecue pork which came as thin chops on a bed of rice & iceberg lettuce. He said it was satisfying. I had the Thai omelet which was tasty and filling but nothing exceptional. If you like spring rolls with peanut sauce and have had good ones, don't order them here. We had the shrimp \"fresh rolls\" & they were over fifty percent iceberg lettuce & the shrimp were so small we had to search for them. The peanut sauce was bland. I've had much better Thai & probably won't come back."}
{"text":"5 R Cha is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley.  The ingredients are fresh, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean.  The won-ton soup is by far the best (and freshest) I have ever had.  I will advise, I love \"hot\" and I can't handle 5 R Cha's \"5\".  They definitely add more heat than most places, which is fine, it's Thai food, but just a warning to those who don't like things hot."}
{"text":"Mango cheesecake seemed old like mail order.  It was my third visit.  Staff a little slow now.   2011 N. Recker Rd.  Mesa  5 violations Not driving 20 miles rt for this"}
{"text":"I invite all my out of town guests to go here with me. The food is good but the service is very random. Sometimes excellent and sometimes confused. Get an experienced server and you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Really highly recommend! This is from foodies who cook their own thai at home and have galangal, thai basil and chilis regularly stocked in our fridge. 5 R Cha has seriously improved since it originally opened. Had Drunken Noodle & Green Curry, both dishes done excellent. We gave them a 9.9. That's only because they did not have IPAs on tap. Instead of serving up mostly starch & soy like many other places, this one had dishes heavy on varied vegetables cooked & spiced just right, nothing oily. Went home with happy tummies. Service flawless & super-friendly.  They deliver now too. This is going to be our new weekly Asian spot. Go - seriously....."}
{"text":"Definitely can't wait to eat here again. For my first time I quite enjoyed it. The staff left a great impression & the food was prepared freshly, yet quickly. I enjoyed the environment of the restaurant and the window seating they have is very nice.  I ordered appetizers of Edamame and Crab Wantons to begin with and they were great, no complaints at all. For my main meal I selected the Pineapple curry with Chicken as my choice of protein and my spicy level was a 4/5. This dish was just the right amount of sweet and spicy for someone who likes a good kick but a sweet and savory aftertaste as well. The only complaint I have here was that the pineapple was cut slightly too large to comfortably chew, but the dish as a whole was delicious. This is a Thai restaurant worth going to go for certain."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but I wont be going back because tonight I accidentally ordered the wrong thing and when I asked if they could take it back the manager said no because it wasnt their fault. Yes it was my fault but any good manager would understand that accidents happen. Oh well ):"}
{"text":"Try looking at the behind the scenes operations of this place, mainly the cleanliness in the kitchen. The dining area is nice, and the food can be pretty tasty, good if you get the right thing. I used to like eating here a lot, until I saw the kitchen. Could be better, could be worse, good regular corner spot."}
{"text":"Best curry dishes in town. Vegetables are so fresh and crunchy. I find myself craving the green curry chicken all the time. Incredibly attentive staff. Ask to try their Thai tea. SO great."}
{"text":"Awesome food, and great service.  I moved out of the general area and don't get to go here as often, but got to enjoy dinner tonight.  Devin was our server this evening and he was wonderful."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. Have had great food and last night was not good at all. No flavor, no freshness. I've had Thai food in several states and his place is the worst I've been too.   Won't be back.....visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Great service here and love the food. Always tasty with lots of flavor and big portions. We make it this a regular dinner date in Saturdays."}
{"text":"Seems like it's getting easier to find good Thai in Mesa!   Dropped by Friday night. The parking lot looked busier than the it really was. Very pleasantly surprised with the interior. It's got a cute little outdoor area and the inside is tasteful and not gaudily decorated. The service was very good. We had Sweet and Sour chicken which was different than we're used to, but still very good. Also ordered up some Tom Yum with shrimp at a hotness of  #4 (out of 1-5). It was nice. I think next time I'll go for 5 though as the 4 didn't even make me sweat a little. The side of vegetarian pot stickers were good.  All the food came out quick and was extremely hot and freshly cooked. The men's room was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always tasty and my many modifications are always done correctly! The folks are very nice and delivery is quick."}
{"text":"Amazing, thorough service! :) 5 stars Delicious pineapple curry & fresh spring rolls! 5 stars.  Pad Thai is a bit dry & bland for my taste. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this past Sunday. My order wasn't correct, but Pat made everything right and my Basil Fried Rice with Chicken was delish! I asked them to top it off with a fried egg (which btw is the way they have it back in Thailand). I am looking forward to going back and having it again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for 2 years. Awesome service. Favorite Thai place. I love the Pad ZU. I come back even though I moved and I don't live that close any more. Good quality ingredients is why I like it here compared to any other than place I've seen in the valley. Lol"}
{"text":"We came here after googling, \"Best Thai food places near me.\" My family and I are from out of state and we were craving Thai food for lunch. This restaurant is very easy to find as it is located on the corner in the shopping center.  It is clean, quiet, and casual. Our server was very kind and helpful. The food came out promptly and was freshly cooked. And the portions were dinner portions so it was enough for two people. We'll come back when we are back in town. I gave it 4 stars because I am used to my pineapple fried rice having chunks of pineapple."}
{"text":"Awesome.  pud thai very flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. It was cooked  native thai heat"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was unsure about the various curries, so our server brought us little tastes of the yellow, green and red curry sauces.  They were all delicious!  I ended up ordering Thai Panang curry with chicken, which has a combination red and yellow curry sauce.  It was absolutely divine. My husband order the grilled seafood with homemade Thai chile sauce and loved it. Great wine specials and very reasonable prices.  Wonderful service and very friendly.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the clean and spacious AMBIANCE 5 stars for the superb SERVICE 5 stars for the delicious FOOD  my favorite: Thai Papaya Salad over fried fish= 2 thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Devin was our waiter , he has an outstanding knowledge of the menu and Thai food, he impressed us is with his friendliness and outgoing personality. We ordered the Chu chee shrimp and the crying tiger steak both Thai hot. Not too hot my wife was able to eat it I had to kick it up a bit  with their spice ground pepper. This is becoming one of our favorite Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"It made me like eggplant!  I decided to go out on a limb and order their eggplant dinner entree even though I've disliked eggplant in the past. My food was excellent. My boyfriend ordered the bbq chicken and he also was really pleased with his dinner. One thing we noticed is that the portions were bigger than the portions you get at Thai Patio down the street (though Thai Patio has fantastic food). We ordered take out so I can't speak to the restaurant's ambience or service though when I walked in, the place was beautiful for sure!  Add this place to the list of great thai food in East Mesa!"}
{"text":"I was in Thailand for 11 months while in the US Military and I believe I know good Thai cuisine. This is the best Thai food I have found in Arizona.  For my first \"test dish\" in any Thai restaurant I always order Pad Thai. It is a common Thai dish and any good restaurant should know how to prepare it well. The Shrimp Pad Thai I ordered here was excellent . The shrimp were large and fresh.  My family all ordered take out and I sampled a little of their dishes also. Everything was excellent and priced reasonably.  I live in Tucson and have yet to find Thai food this good in my home town.   The next time I visit the Valley I plan on trying the restaurant they have in Tempe."}
{"text":"Super awesome pumpkin duck curry. The staff are fabulous and the place is super cute! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was good, which is why I give it two stars. My review loses three because of the staff. The entire structure if the restaurant is extremely disorganized. We ended up having three different waitresses because they all kept switching off - which meant repeating our orders, and forgetting simple things, like no potatoes. (Friend is allergic/has allergy) so we couldn't eat one of our plates. The shrimp had a consistency of rubber and tasted like plastic. We ordered a glass of wine and the pour was extremely small. The staff was very inattentive and dazed. Would never come here again. Whoever does the hiring should be re-hired themselves."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! 5 Star Service...5 Star food!!! Our server Devon was on top of it!"}
{"text":"I really like 5 R Cha! We've been a few times- it's in a good location on Mckellips. They have a cute little bar and a fairly large dining area. Service is good and the decorations are very cute. Very typical thai food- but very good! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Nice quiet place with friendly staff. Our server Michelle was attentive and very polite. Food was tasty with decent portion. We would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I am never disappointed when I go and I ordered different things on the menu. Their service is quick and easy the facilities are clean and everyone is always courteous. I really like their green curry and wonton soup. I swear it helped cure my cold!! LOL!!! They deliver too!! Always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the help our server gave us when asking questions about items on the menu... asked about 2 items and she said the only difference between the 2 was one had chopped chicken and the other sliced chicken... I chose the one with chopped... it was literally ALL onion with a little bit of chicken... when she came back to see how everything was, I told her I was surprised it was all onion. She sent another server over whose English was better. She told me there was a huge difference between the 2 dishes I had asked about.... one was all onion... the other all mixed veggies... no offer to change my dish or make things better... probably not going back..."}
{"text":"OMG! This little place hits the spot!! Not very state of the art... no delivery service... no thrills but the food will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the weekday so we were seated right away. The ambience is quirky casual. There were kinda weird but unique decorations in this place, but that's alright.  Food came out pretty fast. I've tried a few Thai food places, and this one is not bad at all. I think that the food is not as spicy as other Thai places, my friend got HOT spice for his fried rice and it wasn't that bad.  The pad thai was very good tho...the mild was too sweet, so next time I might go for the medium.  Price is pretty good...it's always cheaper for lunch in Thai restaurants which I definitely love.  Ooh and their thai tea is good, if you like it more tea-y...it's not super creamy. It does come in a huge glass.  BTW..5R Cha = 5 Horses  3.5"}
{"text":"My disclaimer: I'm not a Thai Food Snob...I mostly get Chinese food at various places in Mesa and the surrounding area.  We've lived here for almost 14 years and I've driven past this restaurant many, many times without a second thought about eating here. Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I told my wife to stop by and pick up some carryout.  We went online, found their menu, and called in the order. I was certainly underwhelmed at not only the portion size (quite small for the price) but the taste of the food.  I ordered a chicken and noodle entree' and my wife had something similar.  It was expensive just for two meals (over $25) and very bland in flavor.  I doubt that I'll be back any time soon.  I truly can cook a better meal at home for much less.  All in all, it wasn't horrible, just disappointing."}
{"text":"Good new Thai place in Mesa. Compared to Thai Patio, the portions are huge and just as good, and they usually get the spicy level just right for both me (3.5 on a 1-5 scale) and my girlfriend (2) on the curry. They have a fried shrimp appetizer that's also pretty good - definitely my favorite Thai in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at this restaurant, The menu is fantastic, something for everyone.  I love their curry dishes as well their more traditional dishes. one of my Favorites is their Spicy beef noodle soup, the depth of flavor is tremendous. It warms the body as well as they soul. The staff is delightful as well, they are always pleasant, as well as very good at remembering their clientele."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I am always pleased. The food is great, my favorite crab wontons in the valley! The business is very hospitable and polite I always feel welcome when I enter and satisfied when I leave."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I am in love with 5R Cha Thai Bistro. The yellow curry was amazing. Full of flavor, sweet and spicy and fresh. The service was top notch friendly and a relaxing quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent service!   The crying tiger was delicious.   Thai sausage appetizer was spicy but very good. Portions were good size.   I tried Thai ice tea for the first time but it is too sweet for my taste.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I miss this place so much. Nothing compares to this place. We recently moved and it has been hard to find a good Thai place in the area. I have been coming here for years, even when they had their 5 R Cha to go in Tempe. My favorite dish is the garlic entree, I get it with beef and Thai hot (I love super spicy, but you can still taste all of the flavors)! Their chow mein is also delicious too. The restaurant is clean, and the service is good. The restaurant has a very nice decor and very nice ambiance. Next time I visit AZ, this is the first place i am going to!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! It's cozy and tranquil. The food always arrives quickly. The staff are amazing. And the food...oh my goodness!!!! I always get the barbecue chicken!!"}
{"text":"Nice open style restaurant that doesn't pack in the tables so you can actually have a conversation at your table. Patio seating available.  Yellow curry is excellent as are the fresh shrimp rolls."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Thai Rest. Located in Mesa AZ.  A little heavy on the fish sauce. Order their pad gra prow chopped as their cuts of meat tend to be large.  Portion sizes at dinner are big so consider family style dining.  Larb was decent!"}
{"text":"We just moved around the corner and we're looking for a nice little Thai place close to home, Found it! We had an early dinner and it was a quiet in the restaurant. Very clean. We split Yellow Curry over rice and chicken noodles. The curry was to die for, great flavor, portion and spicy. I would go up a notch next time, because we ordered a 3 and I think a 4 would be just right on heat. The chicken noodles were a lighter dish which complimented the curry. The highlight  of the dinner was the egg fried rice my daughter got. The flavor was amazing and portion was just right. All in all a great place, I would have to recommend for any Thai food lover."}
{"text":"So, my family owns a Thai restaurant and grocery store back in Columbus, Ohio. It's authentic and absolutely delicious. When I came here I wasn't expecting it to be on par with my families but it absolutely was!! I was so surprised with how authentic and good it was! I got the pad see ew (pad z u) and it was exactly how I remember it. The staff was friendly and the service was fast. They are a little bit on the pricey side but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and staff. I'm so glad this place is close by. I like to try something new each time, I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The only positive thing this place has going for it is the decor.    I had Green Curry Chicken, but it was unlike any I had had before ... and not in a good way.  What I remember clearly is that the vegetables were cut/sliced too big, not cooked long enough and the sauce was very, very bland.   The food implied a technical familiarity with the the ingredients of Thai food but a complete lack of the artistry of it.   Thai food is all about a balancing of flavors and mouth sensations... 5 R Cha failed at that... miserably.  I've had frozen Thai dinners that were better."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time there.  Very clean & the staff is super nice.  Exceptional food!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a pleasant surprise!  I drive by here everyday & have never gotten my husband to want to go.  We went with friends & all 4 of us absolutely loved it!  The Bistro is larger than it looks & decorated nicely inside, but the food was the true star.  The Tiger steak & lemon fish were everyone's favorite.   I would definitely recommend 5 R Cha & look forward to going again."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Thai and this place definitely hit the spot!!! Even better it was just right down the street from our hotel. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating when we asked if we could order off the dinner menu instead of the lunch. We wanted to eat family style and try a few things out. We shared a couple Singha's and started with the crab cream cheese wontons. Awesome! We then shared the chicken rad naw and the pork larb (mint leaf salad). Both were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"New to the area and excited to have a local thai restaurant, but even more excited when we found out they deliver (and said they will have online ordering very soon. nice.)  So tried it for the first time we are happily impressed. Delivery was a little slow (quoted 35-45 min and took about 65, but they are new to delivery and they are working on it); and it was totally worth the wait. Great flavors with perfect spice (ordered 3 out of 5 and it had a nice kick, not bland at all) and good quality meat (we got chicken). The Green Curry was loaded with veggies and awesome. The spicy basil lived up to it's name and did not skimp on the basil, which we love. We'll be ordering again soon"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch (2:15) and we're told they were ending their lunch and would be starting their dinner service (supposedly starts at 3PM), but were offered both lunch and dinner menus, but it seemed like they really didn't want to serve lunch. We both ordered Pad Thai with Chicken, but their Menu(s) are quite confusing - they approach dishes as having a noodle base and then start adding meats, veggies, etc.  , a common price padding technique. Very confusing!  The Pad Thai Chicken, our favorite Thai dish, was good, not great, and it lacked many of the common finishing toppings (scallions, added bean sprouts, lime slice, etc. ). The dish served was overpriced! The atmosphere was a lot like dining in a 7-11. It is unlikely we will return"}
{"text":"I got the green curry with beef. It had like 3 small pieces of beef total. If I didn't get it as take out, I would have sent it back. I am not a picky eater and I have steal guts. This food gave me the runs and made me sick. I type this from the toilet literally. That was my first and last time I go there. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"This place screams average. The appetizer servings are so-so and skimpy. The high school servers, though pleasant and eager to help, are poorly trained.  Location - 5 stars Ambiance/Decor - 3 stars Food - 3 stars Value - 3 stars Service - 3 stars"}
{"text":"I loved this local spot for Thai food. Freah and delicious. I would definetly receommend the yellow curry chicken. Yum!"}
{"text":"got the green curry and it was amazeballs!!! they were very nice and checked on us frequently. also very fast! hundred percent recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Great service.  Reminded me of Thailand. Tom yum goong, excellent. tiger steak cooked perfect. Very nice establishment."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best Thai places in east Mesa. There are some good ones, but add this to your list of options.  I visited on a Monday for an early lunch and the place was dead quiet. Had an amazing plate of pad thai that was really well done. It's a unique presentation with a little more sauce than I'm used to...and an awkward big serving spoon that was in my way the whole meal. The spoon would work for a group...but no need to rub it in that I'm dining along :)   I ordered a 4, on their spicy scale and I would say it was a mild 3 at best. So aim high if you like hot, they don't over do it at all."}
{"text":"Service and food was good, but I don't find it fair to be charged an extra $1.50 for some steamed rice, because the rice portion was too small, when I'm already spending $15 for a lunch. Give a fair portion to start."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over salted Thai food.  Portions are definitely small for the price.  The service is fine, restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Only my first time to go but I was impressed with what I ordered. We ordered a couple of appetizers, Fried Calamari and Crab Wontons. The calamari was good but nothing special, I enjoyed the wontons, never having had crab in a wonton before.  My entireé was Chu Chee Shrimp, which is, as the menu states, is \"gently fried shrimp with authentic Thai panang sauce.\" I ordered it \"Thai Hot\". I was very impressed. It was an extremely delicious dish. I was concerned that \"Thai Hot\" might be too hot but it seemed to be the perfect degree of hotness. After ordering, I noticed the menu also had \"Double Thai Hot\" and \"Triple Thai Hot\" \"available upon request\". I figure if you go into those areas of hotness you might find you are dealing with more hot than flavor but I might be willing to try it next time. And there will be a next time whenever I am back in Phoenix...all though I will be hard pressed not to order the Chu Chee Shrimp again instead of trying another entree, it was that good."}
{"text":"Unbelievable I ordered food 2 hours ago first the brought me the wrong order I called told them the issue they came and picked up the order said he be back in 10 minutes 40 minutes later I called and asked where my order was I got some lame excuse saying they will put the order in now...... Wtf it better be on its way ... They better give a full credit on the order ..... Sorry we were good customers ..... Next oh and now they forget one of the dishes we order I try to be patient but this hole transaction was a cluster fuck"}
{"text":"3 years ago, when I moved to Mesa, 5 R Cha was one of the very first restaurants I tried in the East Mesa area. I had lunch there with my mom and husband. I remember ordering a Pad Thai and I thought it was just good. My mom and husband both thought the food was just ok back then and the prices were a little too high for us to return so we didn't for about 2 years.   About a week ago or so, we received a coupons magazine by mail and 5 R Cha had 3 coupons on there. We thought, why don't we give this place a second try since it's been a while? Well, I'm glad we did! This time I ordered the yellow curry, chicken and my husband ordered the beef Pad Si ew. We also ordered the crispy chicken portstickers for appetizers. Everything tasted great! The portions were pretty big. The rice was a little less than what I would normally expect with such a big bowl of curry however, they offered me extra rice when I was about half done with my little bowl. The flavors were on point.   The service was very good. The place is clean and well organized. They have a patio seating which is very well lit at night. We got there very late, about 35 min before close but they still were courteous and served us well and the food was good. We enjoyed our food this time that we decided to return again on Friday. We ordered the same exact meals but this time we arrived at 7:30pm!   Without the coupons, the prices would have been slightly high however just to be fair to them, their prices are pretty similar to a lot of good Thai places out there, even in the East Mesa area. We will probably return again soon."}
{"text":"This place changed management and now the menu is different. Prior to the management change I loved this place!!  The food is not nearly as good as it used to be. It's a darn shame too."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I hadn't been here for about two years, and boy, did it change and  not for the better.  Lifeless one dimensional food with no layering  of flavors.  My fiancée, who is not a Thai food person, got a pork cop dish, and all I can say was that it was disgusting.  The Tom ka was bland and the satay was mediocre.  I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food! One of our favorite places to eat in Mesa. Crab wonton, Pad Z U, pad Thai, fresh spring roll are delicious!! DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"I am here now. This is the best curry I've ever had. And the Thai sausage appetizer is so flavorful!  The staff is friendly, the atmosphere beautiful and calming and the portions are pretty big. We just moved to the area and will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out for the first time. They delivered and the sauce had spilled all over the bag! I called them and they said they would send another but I had to give them back what they send ! Like seriously I waited so long for food and I have to wait some more because they want it back?!!! Ridiculous! Also the food is expensive and the servings are soooo small! It was a waste of time and bad service! I am not going to lie that the food tasted good! I give them credit on that because my intentions wasn't to get upset but they didn't handle it well and my stomach hurt."}
{"text":"First time and it was an extraordinary experience. Had the crab wontons and the potstickers followed by Drunken Noodles & Cashew Chicken....absolutely delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good!  I should have gone a little spicier, but I will next time!  I had the Pad Zu under recommendation with shrimp and scallops.  Was great on flavor and not chintzy on the meat. I also had the shrimp dumplings with the plum sauce.  I'm not a huge fan of plum sauce, but this one was excellent.  It was not overbearing and tasted great.  Super friendly service and staff (she actually helped make my decision for dinner).  I'm definitely going to make it a regular place."}
{"text":"My family and I have never had less than an amazing meal here.  The service is great, the food is better.  From the edamame to the spicy catfish, to the panang, to the avocado green curry salmon, the pho and to my absolute favorite, the lemon ginger salmon, it's all wonderful.  Never tried the lard prick, but I'm sure it's amazing.  What can I say?  I love the staff and I love the food.  Have a Singha for me.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed lunch here a couple of times...the yellow curry is quite tasty. I've gotten the \"medium\" spicy and there is just a slight hint of a burn...I haven't tried it \"hot\", but I'm sure that would be manageable. The first time I came was with a friend who had never eaten Thai yellow curry...he was really blown away by the taste.  Lunch comes with an egg roll, which is pretty standard fare - although I don't remember having one when I have visited Thailand? Maybe we did, I just don't remember.  The main dish is plenty for a good lunch without forcing you into an after lunch coma.  The building is easy to find, clean and well attended.  All in all a very good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"After enjoying food here several times in the past, this most recent visit was a big disappointment.  I was excited to find a Groupon and went for dinner.  Service was friendly, but slow...  We started with Tum Yum soup that had a delicious lemon grass broth, a heap of chicken (way too much), and nonexistent vegetables.  I was interested in eating something new, so I ordered the 5R Cha Basil with beef.  Hence, the 2-star rating.  It was bland, bland, bland.  There were maybe 2 or 3 basil leaves in the entire dish.  No spice or flavorings at all so I added some soy sauce to make it edible. Of note, the portion sizes have taken a big hit - probably 1/2 of what they used to serve.  Can't recommend this place any longer."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle dish (spiciness level 3) was delicious!!! I'm already craving it. The green curry with chicken (level 4) was way too sweet. I usually love curry but I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. I found the crab wontons too sweet too. The owner (I think it was him) was really nice and the service was good.   I'll go back for the chicken noodle. Try it"}
{"text":"I would like to start out my review with a warning to DIABETICS.  The sauce they use is extremely sweet.  It's some kind of super sweet syrup with salt and spices.  It would be a good idea to get the sauce on the side.  Other than that, the service is excellent!  The decor is very nice.  I couldn't help but notice the beautiful metallic paint on the walls.  The menu offers a great variety and over all the food is excellent.  They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"This is our Go-To Thai place.  Perfect take out Thai for date nights, memories and lazy evenings."}
{"text":"Had the great pleasure of an early dinner here tonight. The Kao Soi was an amazing treat. Authentic a Thai curry in a comfortable and friendly setting. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Thai food. If you want really good Thai food for the same price, just take McKellips half a mile east and you'll find Thai Patio. I found that it was way better, both for food and for service."}
{"text":"As I write this review, please keep in mind I'm by no means a Thai food expert...  This nice little Thai place is on the corner of Mckellips and Recker Rd. At first glance, it may not seem much, but the gem is truly inside....  Decor: I personally love little restaurants that have simple decor. This place has nice booths, couple of tables. They have a little fountain with fake flowers in it. I personally loved it.  Food: we ordered the original pad Thai with chicken, orange chicken special, and egg rolls. The food was delicious, and I was beyond surprised on how good it was. The sauce did seem a little bland, but overall really good.   Customer Service: Not too much to write about here, she was welcoming at first. Had trouble with English, and trying to work their POS system. Drinks were filled, they were polite. I was satisfied.  Overall: I am glad I didn't read and believe some of the reviews here. I throughly enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant and will continue to recommend, and return here another time."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and helpful with menu questions.  Tom Kha soup is great on chilly rainy days in the valley, and the curries are delicious!  This is a great restaurant to have considering we're in the east valley ;)"}
{"text":"Just an update to my review almost 3 years ago: This place might have gotten even better! They now offer double Thai hot and Triple Thai hot. I had the yellow curry (I'm addicted) double Thai hot,  and can honestly say that it was one of the hottest meals I've eaten, but still had incredible flavors. Can't wait for them to open today and may try the triple Thai hot!  If hots not your thing, you can get it without any spice at all.  On a side note,  Boeing employees get 10% off.  Have been coming here 3 years, and will continue to."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the third time in a month and each time was better than the last!  Server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and offered great recommendations when asked.  Food, above and beyond.  Nice large servings, even at lunch.  The PZ Noodles were so good I took a full order home to share with the family last time.  The kitchen is also good at getting the spiciness just right.  Today we tried the Sweet and Sour w/shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles w/beef and a Ginger dish w/chicken.  We shared the three dishes with 3 of us and even had some leftover.  Not alot of customers during lunch, but we found it a great time to come since some evenings they are waiting out the door......thats a very good sign that this is a good place to Thai!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food.  This place has been here for awhile and I passed it frequently for a couple of years.  So I finally, stopped to give it a try.  I had the special avocado veggie roll, chicken 5 R Cha Basil and Shrimp Pad Thai.  Everything was good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and there were only a few other customers. They got my food out so fast it was actually shocking. The crab wontons were good, and the main dish- massaman curry was nearly perfect. I got 4/5 spicy but I think I could have handled the 5. It had every bit of flavor that I look for in this particular dish and every ingredient was well-cooked. Definitely a new favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times for lunch and the food is always excellent. We have 3 other nearby Thai places to choose from, but the food at this one always seems to taste the best. Not only that, the layout is nicer and they have outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"So sad.  We live nearby and though we would throw some local business their way.  Wife is Thai and the food is bad.  It is edible but I can't tell if they are bad cooks or just adjusted so much for White folks that the food barely tastes like Thai food.  So, So sad."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I stick with the curries and the Rama.  It is one of my staples.  I am glad it is getting better known.  I have been to several Thai places--but I like this one the best.  All of those I have introduced this place to have liked it as well."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about this place is that it's far away from where I live.  I ordered the green curry and it came HOT (temperature wise), fast, and loaded with perfectly cooked vegetables and chicken. The vegetables were a very welcome surprise because most places barely give any veggies and they are usually just bamboo and eggplant in a green curry. This one had bell pepper, eggplant, bamboo, broccoli, and carrots. The curry sauce itself was perfect and the rice was well cooked and amazing. This was by far the best curry I've had in a loooong time. The service here was fast, attentive, and polite. Absolutely no (real) complaints. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All of the entrees we've ordered are very good. Unfortunately it appears they put less shrimp in their spring rolls than they did on previous visits. Very professional and polite staff. I recommend you try this place out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have tried yellow curry at so many different Thai places but 5 R Cha's is the best. The servers are great and the atmosphere is warm and friendly. I am getting take out here tonight actually!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food and very friendly service. I've eaten here as well as ordered delivery and it's always delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I like to get the pad Thai or massamin curry.  If I'm getting Thai food this is where I go.  Give it a try!  They also have a good atmosphere if you dine in."}
{"text":"ordered no spice... not no flavor... came faster than time posted... don't think id order from here again..."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews on places that seem so dedicated but the dedication did not shine through in our food...not even a little.   Our order- take out, cost was $23 and change.  One order of # 21 - Green Papaya Salad - here is the explanation from their menu \"Shredded, fresh green papaya with garlic, tomato, green bean, grilled shrimps and lime juice, topped with peanut.\"  Yeah, there was papaya. Four green beans and two under-cooked almost raw, definitely NOT grilled (boiled or just thawed out?) shrimps that were small one biters at that and inedible. I also got one piece of lettuce on the side that was not fresh....super bummer. Dish was minute, dressing/ juice was very under-seasoned and literally flavorless except for the heat since I ordered it a #3 heat out of 5. A complete waste of a meal.  One order of #56 - Masaman Curry - This curry should contain among other things to make up such  wonderful full flavors, turmeric, fish sauce, tamarind, peanuts, coconut milk, lemongrass...it is SUPPOSED to be  VERY rich in flavor. Well this one fell short, very short, no flavor, no kick ordered #3 spicy, no heat...nothing. I would love to say forgetful but we will always remember it as one of the worst Masaman curries to date.  Also, even though girl who took our order and helped me when I came to pick it up was super friendly, not having any utensils and not one napkin in ToGo bag is frustrating.  Too many Thai places, too many excellent Thai places to ever think about returning. Sorry 5 R Cha, we tried, won't be trying again :("}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times. Really good food. Very nice decor and very attentive service. If you are new to Thai food ask for Leilani. She is a server and is amazing at making great recommendations. LEILANI will make your experience very personal and professional. My kudos to this young server! The pad Thai is a great starting dish..."}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times and never thought to try it. Well I'm glad I finally stopped in. We ordered the tom kha and it was amazing. I also had the chicken pad Thai..amazing. This was some of the best Thai food I have had and the best part is, it's close and good food. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times since it opened, and it was ok (I'd have given it a 3).   We had not been for over a year until a few weeks ago.   This time, I was left wondering if it had changed ownership.   The food was awful, not just so so, but really bad.  It took us 20 minutes to get our crispy spring rolls (which were still slightly frozen in the middle).  My daughter ordered spicy basil chicken and when it arrived (after another 30 minutes) it was an unappetizing pile of chicken with bland sauce and not one piece of basil.  We thought they had brought the wrong entree, so we called our waitress over and she told us that the kitchen had run out of basil.  Maybe I'm confused, but if you run out of a main ingredient for a dish do you still serve it?  It would seem to me that you would at least let your customer decide if they want to order spicy basil chicken without the basil.  I had to wonder if they ran out of chicken if the would have just made the dish with basil and brought it out? The other entrees were mediocre.  The pad Thai had noodles that were overcooked and were swimming in a sweet bland sauce.  The sticky rice was microwaved in plastic wrap and was so mushy that it was inedible.  The manager apologized and told us that it was \"just a bad night\" and took the \"no-basil\" basil chicken off of our bill.  We spent $70 and the best thing we had were the 2 beers. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have been looking for our 'go to' restaurant since we moved. We happened to go here on a whim one evening - and boy am I glad we did. This is my new favorite place. The food is fantastic, it's a nice calm atmosphere, and the staff is super friendly! I'm also very excited that they deliver. I am new to Thai food, so the staff has always been great at helping me find something that I will enjoy.. Everything that I have had is delicious. I love the Thai tea, and tonight I tried the pineapple curry and was very happy with my choice. I've been there twice within the last 2 weeks, and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We are Thai food snobs from Seattle, where there's a lot of good Thai, and finally found a top place in the Phoenix valley area. It's 5 R Cha Thai Bistro in Mesa!    The food and service are amazing and the Panang Curry sauce is to die for!  Very authentic (owner is Thai), and since we've moved to Mesa a month ago, we've eaten there 4-5 times already.  Caution: It's addicting!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there for the first time last night. The food is fantastic! The service is great and friendly I will be coming back often."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant because we wanted delivery.  We were so happy we did, because it was delicious. Good sized portions, nice thick curry, just the right amount of spice based on what we asked for, ingredients seemed fresh and everything was really tasty....and we have left overs for lunch tomorrow.  We ordered a green curry, cashew nut with chicken and we each had a soup.  I thought the wonton soup with pork was exceptionally delicious.  We will definitely order from here again, maybe we will eat there next time.  Well worth trying it.  And the delivery was fast and the driver was very polite!    Thank you!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food. Wait for food was a tad disappointing but once it did arrive it was worth it. They had some difficulty getting us silverware and full size plates too. The Crying Tiger and Phuket Lemon Fish were a huge success. Definitely on my list to return when their dishwasher is back and it's not so crowded."}
{"text":"As a person with a strange addiction to Thai food, I took the risk and entered this Thai food establishment in the middle of my new desert home. Mesa, AZ.    The venue is well decorated and we were greeted quickly. The server was very well mannered and prompt with his service.   We ordered up off of the lunch menu, Pad Thai (chicken) and Sweet and Sour (chicken) and an appetizer of Calamari.  The Calamari was great! nice and crispy. The Sweet and Sour chicken was different then we have ever had, however, still very tasty and good. The Pad Thai.....this is where I became a little disappointed. The noodles were sopping wet, I didn't order soup! And the portions were a little bit on the skimpy side. Not enough chicken to crispy tofu ratio compared to the amount of wet noodles I was eating.   I will give this place a second chance. so look for an update."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Interior is interesting. I love the zen water fountain in the middle of the restaurant. Food has always been amazing here. And they have some awesome coupons. And a reward program. Service is always beyond amazing as well."}
{"text":"I have been going to Thai Elephant and 5 R Cha in Tempe for 6+ years...and I am so happy they have this location out in Mesa where I live. I love the owners, they are so nice. I love the thai iced tea, fresh rolls, pad thai, tom kha, masaman curry...i just love all their food :)"}
{"text":"I came in one day to order a chicken Pad Thai with a Thai tea. Comparatively to other Thai place, 5R CHA has the bigger portion. Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times I wanna give them 5 stars but they are all over with the chic curry portions one day it's loaded with chicken the next you get like 3 small pieces, and your paying top dollar at an off the beaten path location in Mesa, but best yellow curry sauce I have had so far, would put them at 3.5 but it won't let me"}
{"text":"Watch out, the spice is legit! Thai spicy was actual Thai spicy. Drunken noodles were delicious, they don't use the traditional wide noodles, but whatever the the flavor was fantastic. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Had chicken & shrimp pad thai was very tasty and fresh, came w 8 large shrimp and enough for 2 meals so was worth the $14+. Crab Rangoon was just okay needs a bit more cream cheese a little too much imitation crab taste, ill be skipping that next time! Still 4 stars for the entree and freshness!"}
{"text":"Oh .... my.....God!  5 R Cha  Thai Bistro is a wonderful alternative to Mexican food in the Mesa area.  I loved everything about this place: (1) the food: (2) the staff: (3) the ambiance: (4) the parking; (5) the location: and (6) the incredible warm and welcoming service.  The menu has a great selection of dishes.  There is the typical curry, but there is the crispy, fresh Green Papaya Salad.  The Penang Curry is rich, and the spice level of this dish is your choice.  The delicious Green Tea ice cream with Roti is also great.  I think some of these dishes have a Malay/Thai fusion and that is a great idea.  I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We recently moved to the Mesa area from Chicago.  We've been here several times and I've tried something new each time and everything has been fantastic!  And to top it off the service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the masaman curry and it was better than expected. I traveled all the way to Oregon for this quality curry so I'm thrilled to find this so close to home. I highly recommend this plate. Service was excellent as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered BBQ chicken and Basil shrimp. Food was fresh and delicious. I am actually dreaming about that BBQ chicken right now. I also got Thai tea which came in an enormous margarita cup. It was thick and flavorful. My husband and I CLEARED plates!! You are now my favorite Thai restaurant ever."}
{"text":"So first time here and the combo appetizer was good and had a good portion. Service was bad overall. Girl serving us was on her 2nd day working. We waiting 45 minutes and saw about 10 people served and at least another 10-15 to go orders handed out and we did not receive our food. When the server came to tell us there kitchen was backed up I told them to cancel our order and we'll pay for what we got. Then the so called manager came over and said your food is ready now u want it to go? At this point we were over the wait. Paid for app and 2 drinks and left.    Wont be going back there though."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my cousin nd brother on a wed evening and settled on 5r cha  in mesa.   We were seated immediately (we were the only ones there) more people were ordering takeout.  Our drink and food order were quick and service was very friendly.  My brother and cousin ordered the specials:  a lobster noodle dish and a seafood saute.  I ordered a vegetable noodle dish.  Each order came separate and piping hot.  None of us were disappointed with the food or service.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The Rating is just a stop gap till I try it out. haven't really tried it out yet. Heard about it from a \"close\" friend. Went in on a Saturday evening and found it somewhat crowded. This used to be an Italian restaurant. The ambiance was decent, but wasn't really hungry enough to sit down and eat. Will try it the next time I am around the vicinity"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and the atmosphere is nice and has a Thai feel to it. The service is fantastic. The prices are good and the portions are quite large. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone loved what they ordered. It's a great place for a couple of friends or a small group to have a delicious and fresh meal. I ordered the Green Curry and it was delicious; as were the spring rolls, pot stickers and pineapple fried rice. We will surely be visiting this little Thai bistro again."}
{"text":"So good! Never disappoints! One of our favorites is the drunken noodles! Their soups are amazing, appetizers are tasty, I have not had one bad dish from here! Always seated immediately, servers are always polite. We always gave a good meal here."}
{"text":"Fabulous !! Authentic Thai, service is fabulous.  Love the inside decor.    Temperature is cool inside as well."}
{"text":"Went to 5RCha with my wife and two friends to this location in Mesa AZ.  It is not quite what we were expecting.  Perhaps because both my wife and I were expecting more Asian style food, and this was to Westernized.  My wife and I are of Asian background.  My wife's comment after we returned home the next day was \"I can cook better!\".    Our two friends from Kentucky were pleased with the food.    I ordered the Jungle Curry (I was not to pleased with it) My wife order Tom Yum (her comments were that she cooks better Tom Yum)  Our friends order the Tom Kha and some other kind of curry, and they appreciated it.  About the only thing that my wife said was okay was the fresh spring rolls made with rice paper (not the fried rolls).    I guess after traveling through Southeast Asia, my wife and I have gotten very picky about what we call \"good\" Southeast Asian food.  My wife is originally from Southeast Asia, and I have travelled extensively through Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  We wish the owners well, but they really need to be more authentic in their food preparations, and be ready to try some different things.    I was looking for something like a Yum Woon Sen, and I did not see it on the menu."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. Food was fantastic.  Service was exceptional.  I ordered the Yellow Curry Seafood. It was amazing. No doubt the best I've ever had.  It's Friday night and the place was pleasantly busy but not packed."}
{"text":"Never been here for dinner, but I love coming here for lunch since I work close by. The specials are a great deal (I personally love all their curries and can highly recommend them) and the people here are always friendly."}
{"text":"I signed up for the \"5th Lunch Free card\"  Well, I was anxiously awaiting my free fifth green papaya salad this month, and server dude tells me that green papaya salad is not on the lunch menu.  Hmmm....  Nobody told me this the first 4 times I ordered this \"salad\".   It's a little pricey for lunch, and the food is good, but don't bother with the hassle of the 5th free lunch card."}
{"text":"My wife and I are never disappointed at this restaurant.  We are real fans of Asian cuisine but the food here is remarkable, unlike anything we've eaten elsewhere.  Literally you can taste the flavor of each vegetable in what you order. The flavors jump in your mouth.  I do not know what the Thai chef does but whatever it may be please don't change a thing.  Combined with jasmine rice you simply can't go wrong. On our last five visits we can't find one negative to talk about.    The service offered is excellent, with the employees very attentive to each table and the restaurant as a whole.  They show true appreciation for your business and are always glad to see you walk through the door.  Give them a try.  I'm confident you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Had the red curry, my son had the yellow curry. Very good spring rolls. We are planning our next visit, maybe dinner next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Had the yellow curry.  Not too spicy not too sweet.  The soup that came with the meal was a tad sweet, but not bad."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.  Everything I've ordered has been very good.  Green curry is really good, love the fresh rolls and the veggie delight!  The best Thai in northeast Mesa"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Not the cheapest Thai food but definitely worth the price. They were referred to us by our Thai friend and love this place too. We recently moved to Mesa from west LA and got use to eating in Thai town and natalee thai. This place has satisfied our cravings for LA Thai. Any SoCal people reading will know what I mean. It's hard to compete with SoCal asian food of all nationalities..."}
{"text":"I forgot to leave this review months ago but wanted to be honest about my experience. I ordered delivery because I had been here a handful of times and liked their food. After waiting an hour for my food when I was told it would be 30 minutes I was starving and peeved. I live 15 mins from the restaurant. The delivery lady had NO CHANGE which made no damn sense. So she tells me she is going to run back to the restaurant and get it. Upon opening my order I noticed my Thai iced coffee and dessert is missing so I immediately called them to ask for my change and the missing items. I start to eat my yellow curry and rice while I wait and after a few bites I pull out a long blonde hair from my mouth. I'm a brunette. Hair in my food is such a huge appetite killer for me so it's hard to continue eating. After waiting 45 minutes for the delivery lady to come back I'm ready to punch someone. I tell her about the hair I found and even showed her after she asked to see it. I also tell her how upset I am and how I will never eat there again. I literally couldn't believe how terrible my experience was. The restaurant didn't offer me a discount or free item for my troubles which I think is just nice to do but whatever. Good job guys -_-"}
{"text":"I'm such a curry addict. Seriously. This place feeds my curry addiction quite nicely. All the curries here are delicious, but my favorite is the Pineapple Curry. Today I called in for take-out, but I have eaten here several times, and I can say that the place is neat and clean and the service is good. I would have given this place five full stars, but after calling in for take-out, I have one minor issue. I ordered off the downloadable menu from Yelp. Some things, I can't pronounce, so numbers are helpful. The young girl on the phone informed me that their menu had changed, and they don't use those numbers anymore. I let her know that they need to update the menu. She said a quick \"thanks for your feedback\" and said she would know what I was talking about if I just told her the name of the items.  But I still had to spell some of the names and there was still confusion on what I was trying to order.  ... Oh well. The food still came out great and tasty.  Just remember, if you are calling in, don't use the old menu. Lol."}
