{"text":"Had a noodle craving and looked up places in north Las Vegas. I've driven by this place thousands of times and finally decided to give it a shot. The service was friendly and guy at register recommended the Tonkotsu Ramen so went with that. Ramen was good and spicy as advertised. Served with pork, half an egg and other stuff I don't know the name of.  The amount of food you get is a good portion size for the price. Food was very good and the only thing I would recommend is an upgrade in appearance. Place seems very dated and there were boxes stacked up in a corner which were visible from the parking lot. I would definitely come back and try other stuff on the menu and I'm glad I now have another option of food in this area that is already loaded with food options."}
{"text":"I have to say this place isn't bad but it wouldn't be my first pick for ramen. Compared to Jinya and Monta this place is blah. There ramen is okay but if you want delicious ramen go to Chinatown. Like I said it's not bad but it's lack luster. Broth is okay the egg isn't seasoned the noodles are good. But there chasu is SOOO good. Very good customer service and it's close to me but it's just blah."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience here the other day. A small gem in the area I live in. I'm glad there's a place like this outside of Chinatown. Basic menu and simple food. It's nothing fancy, but can definitely do a small date or lunch here. I ordered the boba milk tea and seaweed salad which was good. Husband enjoyed their tonkatsu ramen. It's a nice quiet little cafe that seem to just open recently. Great place to get Thai tea or even ramune soda pop. Their customer service is definitely a plus. Really friendly and all smiles. Should give this small cafe a shot if in the area."}
{"text":"Its a wonder how they aren't shut down.  In my opinion the most absolute worst smells,  and tastes i have ever encountered in my entire life. Inedible all of it. It had some grill outside the entry door and boxes everywhere so we were not sure if they were open other than the sign.  We knew they had opened awhile ago and perhaps should have not gone in."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I had the tonkotsu ramen, it was absolutely delicious, and a very generous serving as well. I couldn't even finish it! The price was also very reasonable. It's better, I would venture to say, than even the more popular Monta ramen, plus there was no wait time. Glad to finally have a good ramen shop outside of Chinatown. I only hope the out of the way location doesn't hurt business. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Tonkotsu ramen for lunch upon the recommendation from a co-worker. Very well made, with a tasty broth. The slices of pork just melted in my mouth. Very filling and tasty. Have returned to try out some of the other soups! Update: The vegetable udon noodle soup was also very good. The ambience and decor need some work, but the service is very courteous and the soups are great."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place like 2 wks ago and have already went back a few times. The people are so nice who work there and you get a lot of food for your money.  I've tried the Chicken Yakisoba, Beef Teriyaki and their Fried Rice (with chicken and beef). All of them were AMAZING! They all tasted so fresh. The veggies they use are definitely fresh. The beef and chicken they use are good quality/ good cuts! They are not stingy at all with the meat! I don't have to wait long at all for it be ready. This is my new FAVORITE place to go."}
{"text":"Pork katsu curry... The best here. Priced like many other places I've been to that sell similar foods, but with twice as much meat. Definitely worth it. I always leave a tip!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's just like the food we used to get while in Japan. Delicious!  And best part I don't have to drive to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Came back again today.... :)  Ordered chicken katsu curry... Chicken fried rice...Thai tea and taro boba...and shoyu ramen. Sooo good! Loving this place!  10 years of living in Japan... I know simple but good Japanese food."}
{"text":"First time trying this place-I just went in to try their boba and it smelt so good in there! I'll have to go back and try the food.   Anyhow I had milk tea with boba and it was so sweet and good! What a treat!"}
{"text":"went here our week and was surpised the shoyu raman broth was awesome . the noodles themselves tasted abit store bought but with the broth being so good cancelsed that out(for me). overall good food..oh yeah also odered the chicken fried rice it was good.next imma try it with teriyaki sauce instead of soy."}
{"text":"Having the Tempura Udon again because it's my favorite. Love this place they have great food and service, not over priced. Casual place to grab some yummy food."}
{"text":"Love their curry sauce and tonkatsus. Their ramen is not the greatest but it is good. I will come back to this place when I don't feel like cooking and craving for tonkatsus and ramen. Price and servings are great!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch. Love their chicken curry as well as their Ramen noodles. The milk tea was a bit too sweet for my taste though."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick, filling lunch at a great price. A welcome alternative to the burger/sandwich lunch rut."}
{"text":"Fried rice is killer. Service and speed are top-notch. Other family ordered ramen and the ramen is also amazing -- the broth is rich, the flavor is nuanced and deep, and the noodles have just the right texture. Tempura is also extremely well made, and for all parts the portions are generous, for a really cost effective price  Would love to come back again when in the area!"}
{"text":"For anyone from Guam you're going to love the shrimp fried rice. Remember shirley's? Its damn near exactly the same taste. You have to take the tails off the shrimp but it reminded me so much of home i didn't even care. The ramen is my favorite though. Huge bowls and the flavor is great. I've found my spot for my fried rice and ramen fix. I hope they stay in business for a long time because they'll have a regular customer for a long long time."}
{"text":"I  really like their food and the price is reasonable. I ordered gyoza, pork curry, miso ramen. it was delicious"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 7 years.  The Tonkotsu Ramen is as authentic you will get this side of the Pacific.  I have been here twice and ordered this with the delicious steamed gyoza both times.  I guess some of the menu is hit or miss from what my friends have told me, but I come here for the amazing Ramen which I can speak for."}
{"text":"Very nice little restaurant.  Delicious food, the boba teas are wonderful and the people are nice.  The portions are generous and the prices are very good."}
{"text":"Steer clear of the Chicken teriyaki plate.  It is not good. The chicken is served in large pieces 2\"x 5\" ish.  The skin just grossed me out.  Looking around the Teri beef looked legit."}
{"text":"I love this ramen place! The best hands down, and I try to come here at least once a week. That's how much I love it. The spicy tonkotsu ramen is to die for."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I had the Shoyu Ramen with extra Charsu pork and a side of steamed Gyoza. The staff was friendly and the service was great. The food was fantastic. The broth flavorful, the noodles cooked perfectly so that you had that very slight chewiness. The pork was so tender it melted in my mouth with intense flavor. The gyoza was spot on delicious.  It was just what i was looking for as i used to live in Japan for 15 years and i have missed that authentic ramen taste. Tokyo Cafe is so close to my house, i know I will be coming back again very soon. I recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen is excellent. The katsu curry, teriyaki, tempura and gyoza were delicious as well. We were driving through Las Vegas and needed to stop for dinner. This place was perfect. We will come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. I came in starving and got the Tonkatsu ramen and fried gyoza. Loved it"}
{"text":"Everything is under $8 and they serve you a mountain of food. Delicious and the best customer service. The perfect little restaurant."}
{"text":"Tokyo Cafe is a special little restaurant. Very good Japanese curry and miso ramen! The flavor is great, and takes me back to when I spent some time in Japan. The gyoza is also a go-to for my visits here, either the fried or steamed versions. I honestly haven't tried many other dishes but my friends are big fans of the curry udon too. Oh, they do offer a cold soba meal too. Perfect for a hot summer afternoon, and comes with a generous portion of tempura. I come back usually once a week!"}
{"text":"The milk tea bobas here are the best I 've ever had!  THE TARO BOBA TEA, omg!!! The food is delicious and super affordable. ..must try this place!"}
{"text":"The food I had was very good. Reminded me of the ramen I used to love to eat in Japan. However, the ambience could use a little work. An unsightly mop bucket with dirty water near the door, empty boxes and cases of water bottles spoiled the atmosphere. I'd come back if only for the food and would recommend it if the ambience was improved. Arigatoh Gazaimasu! Shokuji wa oishikatta!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets without having to drive all the way out to Spring Mountain. $7 for a bowl of ramen or a plate of fried rice big enough to share. Not to mention the mango boba tea--I haven't been able to find decent boba tea since I moved here over a year ago until this place. Finally."}
{"text":"Great Ramen and gyoza was good also. Hard to fine a quick and inexpensive place to eat now a days. Would come back again and again"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. The curry was a bit watery and separated from the rice, which I'm not used to. (But this was about 3 months ago)  Their tempura plate is gigantic, but the pricing is very good.  Its a tight knit space, but It is pretty cozy.  Def. Recommend"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the atmosphere feels warm and welcome. I was looking for a place to get boba on the north side of the Las Vegas and I definitely found the spot. The Milk Tea with Boba was amazing, it was the perfect level of sweetness."}
{"text":"For my first time here... I loved the milk tea boba drink Best place to just hang out The environment is so peacful, calm, and music to just relax   I had the Ramen soup with pork ... Never had Ramen soup before but it was Amazing definitely I will be coming back again    Good costumer service! Every friendly people and they do a good job having the Resturant very clean"}
{"text":"Since this place is a cafe, the menu doesn't have much variety. The dishes are well prepared and hearty. They have a decent list of boba flavors (most of the popular flavors). I ordered a beef teriyaki plate with a side of fried gyozas and seaweed salad.   The beef teriyaki was a bit over drenched with sauce (made it a tad salty). But, was still fulfilling for my teriyaki fix. The side salad was good, lightly dressed with a ginger vinaigrette. The appetizers I ordered were on point. I didn't try their ramen noodles this time around.  I will definitely give there noodles a shot on my next visit. Overall, Tokyo Cafe is the go to spot to soothe any Japanese cuisine cravings."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend amd we both eat a lot! ordered a gyoza, a combo fried rice, ramen and a donkatsu curry, two milk teas. They were all very good and the quantity was exceptional! Very affodable price, very decent food. I will definately come back, very often, and recommend to friends. if you wanna get a quick decent affodable dishes, it is a lot better than Macdonalds. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Surely not the best ramen in town but I enjoy coming here because the food comes out quick and I can always expect the same type of service. The workers are very nice and the price isn't bad either. The soup is a bit watered down but I'll live :)"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem if you're looking for an amazing Teriyaki bowl! Dont let the simplicity of the restaurant appearance fool you. I've been here twice and both times did not disappoint. I ordered both beef and shrimp bowls with a side of shrimp tempura.The beef is actually steak! The portion is large and prices are extremely reasonable. Everything is seasoned perfectly. The side salad is a perfect addition with a mouth watering ginger dressing. The tempura shrimp so yummy! better than many restaurants that charge double the price. Dont forget to scoop up a little side of pickled ginger and garlic puree sauce!"}
{"text":"I thought I would check it out because of the good rating it has on Yelp, but I'm a bit confused about how it got its rating. There was no A/C which even at night was a bit uncomfortable. The food was okay, but I have had better teriyaki chicken at other places. I dragged my boyfriend to this place and I felt really bad after because it was not that great. I honestly don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I go with my coworkers, and I just can tell you I love it, food is great, the taste is fantastic and the attention of the owners and the personal is excellent, is you are looking for good food, and a good meal this is the place!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this place. After having lived in Tokyo for 3 years, we really miss the real deal. This was an excellent substitute! Much better than some other \"ramen\" places."}
{"text":"Love this place, the staff is always so friendly and the portions are so big for the price. They have a selection of Asian sodas which are pretty tasty and hard to find around town. Never been disappointed with the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Right next to my work so I stopped in this afternoon to grab some curry for lunch. It was great and the portion was huge. Nice to have a place like this so close to where I work. I'll def be stopping by regularly."}
{"text":"Omg I absolutely love how they have tofu options here. Very affordable spot and great boba"}
{"text":"Husband took me here cause I'm a ramen enthusiast,I was appalled by the taste of the broth.Smelled like urine, I don't know if it's just that tonkatsu bowl we ordered, but never again will I return...can't compare to fukumimi Cashier lady was unfriendly,and not even a hello or a smile"}
{"text":"Love coming to eat here!! The food is always awesome!  If you have a craving for fried rice this is the place to go!! Not only that but the tempura and teriyaki bowls are amazing!! Come hungry because the serving sizes are huge. Love boba? They have the best in town!! I wish they were open 24/7 I'd eat here all day everyday"}
{"text":"Foods great,  reasonable prices. Very very nice people who give good service. It's nice to have more diversity too,  we need more places like this in North town. I don't care if I ever see another jack in the box! Check this place out. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here at Tokyo cafe.My family and I order our food didn't wait that long, food are good, Chai tea boba was soo good and my daughter loves her strawberry boba , Teriyaki chicken , fried rice and the ramen its good."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food, I love their soba ( cold noodles ) . They serve boba milk tea too! Price reasonable serving good food."}
{"text":"Average.  Definitely not great but not bad.   The one thing that is good is the price.  I would probably give this place a 3.5 star rating if it were possible.   Curry is good, everything else is average at best imo."}
{"text":"Food prepared fast and taste was very good.  Had chicken katsu curry. Chicken was very tasty and portions were large. Miso ramen is also very good, the pork flavorful , and tender.  Goya well worth the price. Ate here two nights in a row."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here last night.  First off I never realized it was here, we bumped into this by chance Bc I wanted a sandwich earlier in the week.  So we decided to do date night here.  If you like great comfort food Japanese style this is the place for you! Prices are amazing, staff is so friendly and service is quick and efficient!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is your legit ramen place in north Las Vegas!  My husband and i always come here when we have some cravings! Their curry plates are the bomb as well. Order the spicy curry! Spice up all your order and you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch and was not disappointed! The food was delicious, came out quick, and it tasted light and refreshing. Whatever these guys are doing, keep it up!"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it. My husband and I love our Ramen and Udon noodles so we were excited to try this place out. The Miso Ramen was really good. Great addition to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon it randomly but it was the best discovery ever! The chicken fried rice is good, plenty of meat. My friend got the shrimp fried rice and there was only like 4 shrimp in it so she was a little disappointed but the flavor was there. I also got a watermelon boba and it was alright, I've had better. The ramen is a must have!"}
{"text":"Good spicy noodles and battered shrimp. All of it was good. Tasted like I was back in Asia. Large portions but not gut busting."}
{"text":"Only just ok. Price is fair but the server has a very unpleasant look to her. Food tastes alright although when you order spicy ramen, it really is spicy, which is a pleasant surprise. As long as you don't expect much or anything fancy, this place is ok. Don't order boba drink though. The boba doesn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Authentic. No where else like it. Amazing charm and people. Reminds of Tokyo, which I miss everyday. This is the closest to Japanese food I have ever had here in the states."}
{"text":"First time here... went with the family. We wanted to try something new and it was amazing... the ramen taste great and authentic!! We will be going again."}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice is very good. Good price and you get a large quantity. Better than Italian China or any of the other names it's had before. Glad the food is finally good. Boba drinks are good too-mango one. The cashier was very nice."}
{"text":"Ramen here was awesome. We ordered two Tonkatsus with extra chashu and eggs and spicy broth, and it did not disappoint. It was $7.99 before adding the extras, which is a very fair price point considering we got two meals each out of our order. Service was efficient and the food was delicious. We'll be back when we're in town again!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the food and the price. Everything is cheap and yummy. My favorite is the takoyaki, there's not a lot of places in the area that offer takoyaki the way they make it. The service (while they could smile more but idc to be honest) is extremely fast."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with the Tempura Udon, the taste of the shitake mushroom broth and the vegetables with shrimp tempura are just the best. We've had the Spicy tonkatsu, which we think it's best ordering it spicy. It's at its point!"}
{"text":"Very good food I came here today and it was delicious I got the chicken to teriyaki bowl and a teriyaki plate with miso soup very good :)"}
{"text":"Tokyo Cafe is amazing. The staff are always nice and th e food warms my soul. The Miso Ramen was so flavorful and the udon noodles are to die for."}
{"text":"I probably should have come on a night when I feel like experimenting. The staff is friendly and its a super casual room. The ramen was ok and the salad was fresh with a very tasty dressing. The curry is ok. Some of the food just reminds me of much store bought pre-prepared food, however everything was freshly put together to order.. just the components seem pre-fab The curry tastes like the packaged squares at the store. Big portions!"}
{"text":"They have the absolute best ramen the miso ramen is the best to me. The service is always very prompt."}
{"text":"Went in on a cold & raining evening.... Have not been there before, I took a moment to browse the simple & easy to read menu... I just couldn't decide on what to get. Jumping back & fourth on what to have, ramen or soba.... I ended up getting yakisoba- combination  at that. Over priced for 3 pics of shrimp. I spent $13.00 on salt. Too much soba sauce & not enough meat. The pork that was in it was super dry & chewy.   2 stars? I felt rushed for the 3 minutes I took to browse. Wasn't greeted when I came in nor thanked for visiting.   I may just go back for Boba. But not for food."}
{"text":"Came here with a close buddy buddy of mine around 8. First thing first! Quiet and mellow even when it got full later on. Gotta pay for your meal first (wich was odd). Ordered our ramen wich was pretty tasty!! Food portion looks small but it fills you up! 3 stars to be fair just cause the location is a little off but it's cool!"}
{"text":"First time here ordered curry chkn katsu....curry on side like dipping sauce nice....free adamame for yelp chkin and thai tea..excellent found a new spot to hang out...."}
{"text":"Very good ramen, especially for the price. Will be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen. Ordered take out for both the shoyu and tonkatsu.  I love the fact that they can make the dishes spicy.  Well worth the price.  The milk tea was too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Udon soup was the worst, however great service. When I advised I did not like the Udon I was offered a CURRY CHICKEN not too bad not the best not the worst"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Simple menu with quality food and good service. My boyfriend got a beef teriyaki bowl and I got a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was really really really good. I came with a small salad and like I said the customer service was really good. They had other items to that I also saw that other people had that looks really tasty look like good food look like it taste good."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, great prices, and close to my house when i don't want to drive to chinatown! Certainly not fancy inside but clean with friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's a close and convinient place if you want Ramen and don't want to drive all the way to chinatown. Service is fast."}
{"text":"Best ramen joint in North Las Vegas! Portion sizes are generous. The place is always lightning fast. I'm in and out of there within 5 mins when I order Togo. The food is good and consistent. Ive had pretty much everything here - and let me tell you -- it's the best prices in town! The teriyaki is always juicy and fresh. The ramen is never mushy. The miso and shoyu ramen are super tasty. The veggies are fresh and crispy. The soba is to die for.  Both the cold and stir fried Yaki Soba are delicious. 1 order is enough for 2 people to share.   Service is friendly. Atmosphere is quiet and never too busy.   The one thing this place needs to improve on is their boba drinks. I've had both the Thai tea and milk tea - both of which is sugar overload. Drinks are premade and can not be adjusted. When asking for less sweet -- I was told it's not possible since it's premixed. Of you're looking for an authentic boba tea - look elsewhere. Their sugary drinks tastes like flavored milk with a ton of sweetener. But if you're in the mood for ramen or soba -- this is the go to spot!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki and the coconut boba tea. It's was really good and the portion sizes were excellent. The staff was also very friendly. I would definitely go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have a ramen place on this side of town. The tonkatsu ramen is my favorite with a little spice and my husband always gets either the miso or shoyu, which are good also. We've also ordered the beef fried rice a couple of times and it definitely did not disappoint :P"}
{"text":"Just good, fast, hot food. What was ordered: Edameme, vegetable tempura,  shrimp tempura,  tonkatsu ramen and chicken teriyaki. Just plain good.  Will order again. Beware It's a lot of food for $30."}
{"text":"Best boba Thai tea!! The boba balls are never weird like many places that offer this tea. Really good menu items as well! Recommended!"}
{"text":"The noodles I ordered were very delightful and very tasty. The boba was exceptional but the noodles definitely made up for the experience. A definite must try for any Japanese food go'ers."}
{"text":"What a solid establishment! Decided to give Tokyo Cafe a try and was surprised at the quality! Me and the misses both got the Miso Ramen along with free edamame with a yelp check in! Awesome! The edamame came out to the table very quickly and was salted perfectly and tasted as they should. The Ramen also arrived shortly after and was then slurping away! The Miso broth tasted very different from the broths Ive had at china town and I liked it! It seemed to be a soy sauce based broth with miso and had that extra salty kick that was a welcomed combo, the ramen was very chewy and dense and had perfect texture! The chashu was awesome! Less fatty, tender, and Great flavor! Along with bamboo shoots, Nori, and the egg was such a great taste! Two bowls of ramen with two drinks for just about $20 even, Not bad at all considering the amount you get. Def a great addition to North Las Vegas as we needed a good ramen spot! So it surprised us so much that we got the tofu and chicken curry to go. As we just finished those dished, The curry was also a great dish! The tofu and chicken both has great crust and crunch, the rice was cooked well, and the vegetable were fresh, steamed goodness! The curry was not overpowering and complemented the tofu and chicken very well. I hope Tokyo Cafe the best and that they prosper as It will be def in my reg rotation of restaurants to go and eat at!"}
{"text":"The location is very convenient and the services is wonderful, from the person who takes your order to the people who handles your food. The food is great to satisfy you immediate need for curry and ramen."}
{"text":"Great good very inexpensive! I had the pork katsu curry and my wife had chicken katsu curry both were excellent! We messed up and order a appetizer of edamame way to much food. Most everything here you could probably split there is so much food. We highly recommend you stop in here!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place prices are reasonable and the portions are amazing. Trust me when I say you will not leave feeling hungry after you've eaten here."}
{"text":"Best fried rice yet!   So being the typical yelper I saw this new place. I have seen many businesses come and go from this location. On our first visit, it was 45 mins before closing. No one was eating in, there were people waiting for to go orders. The weather was horrible that day so, that didn't surprise me.   We ordered the tonkotsu ramen  it was great! Flaw or was amazing, it had plenty of noodles and fixings! My mom ordered the veggie tempura udon soup! Mmmmm I almost regretted having ramen after tasting the udon. Tempura was Krispy you could tell it was not store bought or frozen. To go we orders chicken fried rice. The rice didn't have much color to it, which in my opinion is good. I hate rice that has overwhelming soy sauce flavor. This rice was great. The chicken to rice ratio was great and the portions on their meals are a steal for the price they are charging. Not one thing is priced over $8.00!!!"}
{"text":"I always like to eat in the vicinity of Spring MTN for lunch, a chance in here, first-class service, delicious food, I would come back again, I will bring my friends! Love here!!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen!  Recommend to anybody looking for a great casual cafe with delicious rame . I hald tonkatsu spicy ramen. Service was pleasant and really welcoming.  This is my go to place for Japanese ramen soup!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in a while! I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and it was delicious! Very smooth with wonderful flavor! My boyfriend ordered the katsu chicken curry and it was ok. Tasted more like the kind I make at home lol"}
{"text":"Very good ramen! Haven't tried much else besides the tonkatsu ramen and the udon but that was so great. Big portions, low prices and delicious, delicious ramen!"}
{"text":"Good ramen at a good price. It's too bad they apparently don't have a liquor license as my meal would have been even better with an ice cold Sapporo.   The restaurant is inexpensive compared to similar ones around Flamingo & Decatur; however, it could use more atmosphere."}
{"text":"Why didn't anyone tell me this place is right now the street from my house ?!?!! I had the shoyu ramen and let me tell you it was excellent. It looked as good as it tasted which was amazing. This is my first time here and I'm looking forward to trying all the other stuff they have to offer. If your tired of pho and want something different try their Ramen you won't be disappointed . The portion size was huge I couldn't even finish it all lol #vegasgem #vegasfoodie #musteats"}
{"text":"Great Idea to have a Japanese restaurant vs. the many failed attempts this location had with the Chinese food. It's awesome that they finally have a place like this in North LV. We had the spam and pork curry and Char Sui ramen. Everything was pretty good-i was actually really surprised how good it was!  This will definitely be our new spot when we have a Boba or curry craving instead of driving all the way across town. We didn't take pics this time around, but I am sure we will be here again and will take many delicious food pics!! :)"}
{"text":"We had been dining pretty regularly downtown for good ramen and just hadn't found anything that was good up north. We found this location and after our first visit we're hooked. We had the Tonkotsu Ramen. It was prepared and on our table within minutes. Great location. Great food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch today to try it out!  Friendly, fast service and the food was great!  I had the Shoyu Ramen, Shrimp Tempura and a Thai Tea...one of my new favorite Ramen spots, especially up here off of Craig!"}
{"text":"This venue has been plagued with bad business. Hopefully this noodle shop can end that trend. The food wasn't bad,  i enjoyed the miso soup and the shrimp tempura was good. I'd give this place 3.5, but 4 , benefit of the doubt.    The menu could have a little more variety, other than that,  I'm rooting for its success.  It's good to have a noodle shop around here."}
{"text":"Everything is made in house cooked to order and fresh. Very delicious. Will definitely be the place I go for ramen from now on. Fried rice and fried udon noodles were on point. You definitely must try when you are in the Vegas area. It's a little ways from the strip, but if you have a car, definitely worth the drive. Photos will come next time. Was too yummy I completely forgot to take them."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but the cashier/server guy is so rude! I don't plan on coming back here because he's so rude and impatient. He's the skinny dude who has pimples and a goatee. Just because you hate your job doesn't mean you have to be mean to those who are hungry and nice to your mean ass. Douchebag!"}
{"text":"The steamed gyoza and the vegetable tempura appetizers were delicious! The shrimp teriyaki was slightly chewy. The curry chicken katsu was excellent. Very reasonable prices for all the dishes."}
{"text":"A really good ramen shop in the north side. I tried the spicy miso ramen and the beef fried rice. Both tasted better than I expected."}
{"text":"Great quick service. Really quick food. Ate at the restaurant and they keep the place clean. Just looks a little run down."}
{"text":"First visit after driving past for a year. We got beef teriyaki plate and curry pork Katsu udon with tempura shrimp and miso soup. Everything was very good and it's a good value for the price, we'll visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim with my husband. Our stomachs lead us to try a new spot. Their sign reads: ramen, curry, teriyaki, and boba. How could we go wrong?! It's a small little joint. Clean with minimal, simple decor. We ordered seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, spicy shoyu ramen, and a chicken teriyaki bowl. The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. Even better, the food was delicious! Very generous portions. We left pleasantly full, and with leftovers to boot! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was quick.. A definite place to eat on a chill and relaxed day like today"}
{"text":"The stir fry is HUGE... But not that great. The Ramen is excellent. Thai Tea boba was great!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their katsu Chicken. Nothing but breading and rice that got me full. Chicken pieces are very thin."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Tuesday night and it was real relaxed. The food was awesome! I got chicken curry katsu and it reminded me of Coco's curry which is a very popular place in Japan. They have spicy as well as mild. We also had fried rice and Miso ramen everything was great! The menu prices aren't too bad considering how much food you get. Expect to take some home!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat and grabbed some Tonkatsu Ramen.  It was flavorful and just down right awesome.  I would come back here and eat this everyday if i could.  Prices are cheap."}
{"text":"This place is what I expected! Fast service, good food, and various boba tea options.  The service was fast and the cafe was clean.  They have a simple, but tasty menu.  Customer service was good and prices are reasonable. I ordered the Spam Katsu Curry which came with a side salad. I also ordered a Boba Tea.  The curry was similar to a gravy in taste and consistency. The side salad was basic: iceburg lettuce, shredded carrots, and a ginger dressing. The tea was awesome save the slightly, chewy-than-normal, boba. Overall, the items I ordered were yummy!  'Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Now I can get Ramen close to home with out having to go all the way to spring mt. There Chicken Katsu  curry was also good."}
{"text":"Tokyo Cafe is a win!  I'm not usually on this side of town, but I was out here visiting a friend and wanted to pick up food on my way home. With the help of the Yelp app, I found Tokyo Cafe.  Located in a small shopping center, Tokyo Cafe can be difficult to find at first. Once you park, you might try to rethink your decision if this was a good find or not. This place looks nondescript for a place called \"Tokyo Cafe\". Decor is not fancy by any means, but sometimes those are the most delicious places and in this case, it is true!  The menu is simple and straight forward. I ordered the steamed gyoza, the tonkotsu ramen, and the chicken katsu curry. The person who took my order was quick and friendly. I only waited about 10 minutes for my order. While I was waiting at one of the tables, I saw someone eating their order of fried rice. My mouth started to water so I jumped back in line and ordered a chicken fried rice to go. Don't judge me.  The gyoza was good. They come either steamed or fried to your liking. The ramen was really good despite some of the questionable pictures that I found on yelp. The broth was delicious and the toppings were generous. The chicken katsu curry was huge! The katsu was crunchy and the serving of rice was heavy. The curry came on the side, which I appreciated since my food was to go. The fried rice was flavorful and also a very generous serving.   The food alone was tasty which would be a solid four stars from me. The extra start comes from the price. All of this food for under $30 was a steal. Even the two of us couldn't even make a dent with these crazy portions. Talk about leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I can dig that."}
{"text":"I was going to inquire about TAI KWON DOE lessons at a place across the street from this resturant. I saw this resturant Grand Opening sign and decided to give them a try since I was to stressed to cook that night. I am ex-military and was stationed in Japan about 10 years ago. The food was the highlight of my tour.  With that said, I was already open to give them a try. Folks, this place has humble ownership and trying to really be a good staple resturant in North Las Vegas. They did some renovations inside and outside. I think they are trying very, very hard to ensure they are not on dirty dining. I enjoyed my meal and will be back. I think their menu will expand once they increase their customer base. It's very hard to find clean establishments in Vegas (yes I said it), however, they impressed me with how they were trying to make sure I had a clean memorable experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much my go to during the winter. The menu is small and to the point. I love the fact this restaurant is close to my house, and cheap.  Shoyu ramen, medium spice and fried gyoza are the absolute best. I would give 5 stars but there's an area in the corner that's ridiculously cluttered with boxes..hello recycle guys.  Also there's a lady who usually works the register, she needs to work on her manners and people skills. Other than that it's great."}
{"text":"I can gladly say I know have a go-to curry restaurant in each part of town. There's more than just curry too, my date got a teriyaki bowl and she said it was fantastic.   Tokyo cafe does it right with fair pricing and delicious food. Great, friendly service. 10/10 would trade in my chopsticks for a fork to swallow my curry whole again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Miso Ramen and Tonkotsu Ramen. Portions were well sized for the price. Soup base was a bit saltier than I expected, but was paired well with the noodles.  Thai tea was also good."}
{"text":"The place was not busy but the food was great. I got the strawberry milk boba.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a milk tea with boba to try them out and they have by far the best I have had in town. Their boba has great texture too not just mush in your mouth. Definitely recommend them. Excited to try their food!!"}
{"text":"ordered a shoyu, and the broth was enjoyable, but not my favorite. the noodles are definitely not authentic Japanese food, but it was tolerable. tried both the steamed and fried gyoza. if I had to choose, the fried ones are better. gyoza does not taste authentic. tried the chicken katsu and it is very comparable to zen katsu, but the curry is less concentrated and a bit more watery. I personally do not like the consistency, but the taste is good. overall, the only thing I would ever order here is the katsu with curry."}
{"text":"Always a delight coming in. Great food & friendly staff. Miso soup is always a must when eating here along with the taro boba!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is great and the customer service is awesome. My favorite is the udon noodle soup with tempura vegetables and shrimp.  The fried rice with beef is also so good."}
{"text":"This was my first Ramen experience and I've only had the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Chicken Udon soup here but both were delicious.  Service is prompt and the prices are great.  You get fairly large portions of food, I barely finished half of my Ramen. The menu is concise and the staff are happy to explain what any of the dishes are."}
{"text":"Very fordable Big bowl of Ramen soup well worth it ..it was so delicious I couldn't even finish it all I had to take the rest home and have it for dinner I ordered the miso Ramen"}
{"text":"Was really in the mood for some reman but had no Idea where so I went of certain review off of yelp  The place is really great great service great employees it felt more like a family environment than a business I would really recommend everyone to come here no matter what time of the day"}
{"text":"Favorite ramen house. The owners are absolutely awesome and very welcoming. We bring our kids here often. My son is 2 and a half and loves the Katsu Curry and asks for it all the time. My favorite is the Tonkatsu Ramen spicy with extra chashu. Don't forget Gyoza for an appetizer, taro milk tea and the best fried rice I've ever had."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA, where there is plenty of good Asian food to compare. Ill tell you, I came in and tried both, chicken and beef teriyaki and they were both bomb bomb bomb. And the prices are excellent. Plenty of food for like $5.99. Can't beat that. And the service we got was so kind and friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I come here all the time.  I'm honestly suprised they don't know me when I walk in yet lol.  I really  like the fried rice here.  All the different types are great. They have recently started letting you order it spicy.  They cook the spicy into it just the way I like it.  The Ramen is also very good, I haven't had Ramen at too many places in town yet, only three or four other restaurants but this place is right up there.  The portion sizes for the peice is crazy good.  You got so much food for a reasonable price.  The restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Compare to all the places I have been for noodles, its not the best noodles. But the place is clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"I am really excited about this new establishment! Previous businesses in this space have not made it but I have hope for this one. No other restaurant like it in the area. Simple Japanese dishes and ramen.   The atmosphere and decor resemble a place for a quick bite, very casual and bright.   I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and was very pleased! The broth was delightful, pork was extremely tender and flavorful. The prices are comparable to other ramen places. It's hard to find good places to eat in this area, this one is a keeper."}
{"text":"Simple and tasty Japanese food. Mostly noodle dishes. The taste is very authentic. Again, don't expect fancy dishes, like family cooking. Miso soup is excellent. Ramen and yakisoba so good. Just like eating like we were back in Japan. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here based off of the reviews and I wasn't disappointed! Ramen was delish!!! Way better Han other spots I've been to in town. It's close to my house so that is a plus! As its getting colder outside, it's nothing like having a hot bowl of ramen to hit ya belly! Prices are reasonable too and won't break the bank!! This spot is legit."}
{"text":"Tokyo Cafe is a very nice addition to this neighborhood's limited selection of non-Latino ethnic dining.  It's not a chain, and the food is all homemade from what I can tell.  I've been trying a few dishes here lately, so I'll go through my recommendations!  I am a big fan of the fried rice with beef, and the curry katsu with pork.  Both dishes are served with huge portions.  The fried rice lasts me 2 meals easily!  It's nicely light and fluffy, without a lot of salt and nearly no grease.  It is a less flavorful style of fried rice, but it's wholesome and filling.  I prefer to order it with beef, which is prepared in little bite sized strips, and is tender and quite flavorful.  The pork katsu here is quite nice.  If you haven't had Japanese curry, it's thick like Indian curry, but not as spicy and herbal as Indian or Thai curry.  This curry is maybe a little less spicy than Zen (often considered the best Japanese curry in town), but the flavor is still quite nice.  The fried batter is light and flaky, the pork strips very tender.  They serve you two big cutlets; a huge serving!  It also comes with a salad that has a very unique lemony dressing on it that was super refreshing.    I'm not a huge fan of the ramen (I am the former duke of Monta though, so I have had a lot of the best Vegas has to offer).  I've only tried the Miso.  It was a bit thin, and the flavors were a little off balanced.  By far not a bad dish, just something that doesn't hold up to the places over on Spring Mtn.    I find myself going to this restaurant almost one week.  I wouldn't recommend traveling far to eat here, but if you work or live in this area and you haven't tried the food, you are missing out for sure!"}
{"text":"The dishes are HUGE! And decently priced. The Thai Tea is amazing as well. No problems at all with the establishment."}
{"text":"So I've driven past this place for about a year and never noticed it but today I yelped noodles and since I was in the neighborhood we stopped in.  Ordered veggie fried rice, tempura veggies and tonkatsu ramen.  Food came out quick, like in 5 minutes!  First bite was the ramen, excellent!! The broth was superb with flavor that was layered with ginger, onion, garlic and pork. It was the perfect place for those noodles that were also perfect.  Next bite which looked like a carrot turned out to be tempura sweet potatoe. So crispy and wonderfully salty in a good way. The tempura zuchini and carrots were good too.  Last but not least was the veggie fried rice which was so good , I couldn't stop shoveling it in my mouth with my soup spoon. It was light and full of veggies.  This place is a \"hole in the wall\" but one that gets 4 stars.   They could charge double and I would pay for it.  You gotta check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with my mom already and the food is so fresh and tasty. My mom is obsessed with the fried shrimp and I'm obsessed with everything lol. The service is very polite. My 18 month old made a mess with his meal and got quite a bit of food on the floor and one of the male employees said \" Don't worry about it. I have a 15 month old and that's what they do\" They have the best ramen! Such huge portions. We keep going back for more."}
{"text":"I intentionally came in for beef fried rice, but I ended up ordering beef soba (Yakisoba). It was very delicious and authentic. I visited Japan numerous times and have eaten Yakisoba from different prefectures and this Yakisoba tasted no different.  Slightly, and I mean slightly on the oily side but that's just me. You won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I lived in Washington State my teen years and grew up on Yakisoba, and for some reason everywhere in the 3 surrounding states makes it wrong. It's not suppose to be udon noodles or ramen noodles, it's not teriyaki sauce or thai sauce, and it's also suppose to have veggies and I've never seen it spicy, until Vegas. I have spent the past 8 years in southern Utah and have looked through probably every Japanese/teriyaki joint on yelp trying to find images of what I know Yakisoba to be. I have ordered it one too many times to only be disappointed when it had arrived. Thanks to a fellow yelper, I saw he said he had been to Japan and this was the real thing, So I decided to give it a shot and sure enough! Hands down the one place I have found in 8 years in Oceanside, Vegas and St. George that makes it authentic! I was a happy camper yesterday and now i'm only sad I live 2 hrs away. =) Only down side was I like broccoli and mushrooms as well in mine, but I will take what I can get! I look forward to my next drive to Vegas."}
{"text":"We both had tonkatsu ramen,  couldn't eat the pork, it tasted like freezer burn and ruined the whole thing.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"The boba tea is amazing and the Ramen is delicious. We will definitely be returning for another meal."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I think this place was gross from the outside and didn't want to go in. But I read the reviews and hunger won. The menu is super simple and straight to the point. It was a little dirty since there were boxes stacked in a corner and the counters needed to be dusted. I ordered food anyway since the most unattractive places have the best food.   THIS PLACE IS LEGIT!! The food came out super fast. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen, spam katsu, fried gyoza and shrimp tempura. All was done in less than 10 min.  Y'all I'm in love. I was gonna be so made of this food was trash but I will define coming back here!!   I just wish they would decorate the place a little more but whatever. The food is the important part and they nailed it"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I recently found this place on Yelp since it's just a few miles from where I work and had somehow missed it for years.  Don't let the appearance fool you:  the place is kind of hiding in plain sight, but the food is wonderful.  The menu is great and the price is right.  Walk up to the counter, place your order, grab a seat and wait for the deliciousness!  Here's the scoop on some favorites so far:  Miso Ramen -- Delicious, and more than enough for lunch!  Grab some chop sticks to accompany your spoon and settle in.  Don't be in a hurry; just savor the flavor.  This is probably my favorite thing so far.  Chicken Soba -- A close second.  When I'm not in the mood for soup, the chicken soba is delicious.  As with the soup, they're going to serve you a lot so plan accordingly.  This is a great dish to take some home with you though, so don't worry about finishing it all.  Next on my list to try:  the Chicken Katsu.  Based on what I've tasted so far, and what I've seen brought to other customers, it's going to be delicious too.  Parking is basically behind the restaurant and shared with the other nearby businesses, but there's always plenty of slots open.  Access back onto Craig Road can be a little bit of a hassle if it's a busy time of day.  If you're on the northeast side of town and have a craving for noodles, give this place a try.  It's a pleasant break from all the usual fast food chains that seem to dominate the area.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was quick, food was excellent am glad my wife and daughter saw this place and read the reviews before we went to the cannery buffet"}
{"text":"I love this place! Only decent place up North that have curry, ramen and a bunch of other dishes.. for super cheap too! Thai or milk tea is a must."}
{"text":"I truly wish there was more Tokyo Cafe around vegas, i don't even have the right words. They are GREAT, service is wonderful, always a smile on their face . And let me tell you, i have tried almost every ramen shop and NOBODY has a better soup. I LOVEEE this place with all my fat little heart"}
{"text":"The flavors are on point . Prices are agreeable and staff is Nice. I came with my brother and I and we got Udon noodle tempura and miso soup. Miso soup was enjoyable spicy with good portions same with Udon but not spicy. So far my experience here for the first time is excellent. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I ordered tonkatsu ramen. It was okay, but just okay. The flavor was just off for me and the noodles not great. I had mango milk tea with boba but there was no actual tea in it but the boba were good so I'd probably come back for Thai tea with boba but that's it. I'm sad over this because it's so much closer than Monta but it can't compare. At all. Like, not at all. Sweet people though, very friendly."}
{"text":"First time eating there. My sister and I stopped by at around 1/2ish for lunch. We ordered both shoyu ramen I believe? It was pretty good & the broth was very flavorful. The only thing I would warn you about is the spice level. In my opinion it could have been toned down some, but my sister enjoyed it. We also had the chicken katsu curry which was also good. I would come back."}
{"text":"Shoyu Ramen was excellent! Finally a good place to eat near work that's not fast food. Also recommend their teas. I loved the thai tea."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I'm already in LOVE. A friend suggested this place to me very casually and I was not expecting what I got.  My boyfriend and I had the tonkatsu ramen, some vegetable tempura, and a bowl of miso soup and it was delicious! I'm originally from Texas and I thought we managed to get some decent ramen out there but boy was I wrong! Everything was so flavorful (the veggie tempura was pretty standard though) and the miso tastes distinctly different from what I'm used to but not in a bad way.  The is definitely going to be a comfort food staple for me from now on. Who doesn't love reasonably priced and delicious ramen?"}
{"text":"First time trying it here, compared to other ramen places the broth lacked a little bit of flavor. But the portions for the price. Great. Good food and good vibes from the staff. Also tried their milk tea boba. And can't complain. Enjoyed my experience here. I'll come again when super hungry"}
{"text":"This is a small little Ramen shop with a few other Japanese menu items. I had the Tonkatsu ramen which was good.  The interior of the restaurant is very plain and simple but the food is good and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out which you'd think with ramen is a bad idea, but they packaged up the broth and noodles separate.   Ordered the tonkatsu and shoya ramen which were both done well. The seaweed salad was small and a little too sweet. Got a boatload of fried rice which was well done. They don't skimp on the ingredients.    Ordered some chicken Katsu which the kids loved. Food came out quick!  My favorite Japanese diner! Will go back."}
{"text":"Good food! We had beef teriyaki and spam katsu curry. Both were delicious!!! And the servings were decent size. I love the fact that the katsu curry was freshly crunchy and the curry sauce was served on the side... soggy food is a pet peve of mine. Curry on the side is a good call guys! The restaurant is not so pretty but don't let it fool you. The gentleman was very friendly and served our food with a welcoming smile. The lady at the register is not so much friendly, probably just shy, didn't crack a smile made me feel unwelcomed. But that didn't stop me from ordering. The Yelp reviews were so good, I've gotta try this place! Overall, I am happy."}
{"text":"Came to this place because the reviews were good, such a disappointment. Ordered the chicken teriyaki, sauce on the side, the plate comes flooded with sauce. Same with the beef teriyaki. The meat is dry, and tasteless, sauce taste like it's from the bottle. There's is nothing authentic about this place, except the bottled drinks they have. Will never be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place. I had the miso ramen and beef fried rice. Both amazing. The workers are very friendly. Definitely won't be my last time there. Highly recommend the beef fried rice"}
{"text":"Their Thai iced tea is delish! I had their Chicken Teriyaki Bowl and it was good. They give lots and lots of rice! Guess they did away with the check-in edamame, because there wasn't any check-in goodness to be had."}
{"text":"We had Chicken Katsu, Chicken fried rice, and Shoyu Ramen! All were were well cooked and came within 5 minutes. Thai tea and strawberry boba was also delicious"}
{"text":"Tokyo cafe is a favorite dinner spot for my family! Always great service, quick take out and amazing prices! Haven't had anything here that I disliked! Portions are generous so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price, delicious food, good fast food. amount of fried rice is very large. free gyoza for 25+ order"}
{"text":"a friend recommended this spot, if you like ramen noodles you won't be disappointed, the also have fried rice, shrimp tempura, udon soup , curry, and other appetizers, clean place, friendly staff and boba Thai tea!, skip driving to china town if you live on the north side, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I don't know how Tokyo Cafe has 4.5 stars. Maybe because it's the only ramen shop in North Las Vegas? I came here after realizing Jun's was closed. I intended to get the tempura udon but saw a picture of the curry udon and ordered that along with seaweed salad. The restaurant is small and casual. You order at the counter and get a number for your table. The seaweed salad came out quickly and I had no problems with it. The curry udon however was... not very appetizing. Maybe my problem is with the dish of curry udon and not Tokyo Cafe, who knows.   I've never loved udon. Compared to ramen and soba it's so... thick... wormy. However, with a light broth it can be enjoyable. That all changes with curry udon. You see, with curry rice you can slowly combine your curry and rice to the right ratio. With curry udon they just dump all your noodles into the curry and noodles don't do a very good job of soaking the curry up. So basically you're eating noodles and then if you want you can slurp up the equivalent of a gravy and have a heart attack. There are also no vegetables except the pickled onion and ginger you can get from the condiment table. And on top of it all... deep fried chicken! Needless to say I didn't finish this dish and I definitely didn't feel very healthy afterwards.   So yeah maybe I made a bad menu decision. I probably will come back to try the tempura udon or something not so heavy. I will say they do a swift business. I saw a lot of construction workers and business men coming and going, ordering ramen, fried rice, udon. I'm glad to see fast food Japanese food that isn't teriyaki chicken being enjoyed by so many people! However, I definitely wouldn't give this place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is not good. The chicken is rubbery. The curry sauce is literally brown gravy with curry seasoning. #disgusting. Not sure how this place's rankings are so high."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I just moved to the North side of town and all my ramen joints are so far away... I saw this on yelp and decided to give it a shot. So far, I am impressed. It's not the most beautiful building but the staff is always on point, and I love the quality/favors of the food. My favorite is the Tonkotsu ramen. I always order it extra spicy...it comes super duper spicy and I love it! Usually places are afraid to make things that spicy especially when a 120 pound Asian women is ordering it. We've ordered the soba noodles and shrimp tempura. Everything we've tried has been great!"}
{"text":"Came in because I saw the sign and being from Hawaii I super excited. When I came in I was a little disappointed at their small menu. I did like he fact that there was Japanese music playing in the background and the worker was Japanese. I wanted the ramen but I was told that they use tap water and not filtered water for the broth which means I can't eat it. My stomach can't handle tap water. I order the fried gyoza which was ok. Little on the small side but still delicious. I also ordered the chicken katsu curry. The curry had no veggies and was the broth itself. It tasted a little bland. I think if veggies was added to it then it would have more flavor. Not sure why it has the word aloha in it because it's a Japanese place and nothing Hawaiian about it"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had a strawberry boba with some miso ramen. The service was extremely fast, the ambiance was amazing, and the food tasted spectacular. My ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and although I asked for normal and not spicy, there was enough spice in the miso soup for taste, which was incredible. The strawberry boba itself was okay. The boba balls were very soft, not frozen, and were perfectly chewy, though the actual strawberry flavor tasted way too artificial and was essentially bubblegum pink/flavor instead of strawberry. I'm sure another flavor would've been better.   Anyway, overall, this place is amazing and I definitely will recommend to friends and possibly bring some here too. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went back!!! Kuddos to the owners! Had the tonkotsu ramen again, delicious!!!! Also tried the fried rice and it was so good!!! Also had the milk tea boba and great as well!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen spot on the north side of Vegas. Very small cafe. Staff are friendly and sufficient. Sufficient amount of food for cheap price"}
{"text":"Price; good! Food; good! Service; good? No, really super amazing awesome. We were chomping down on chicken katsu curry and pork katsu udon when a homeless man walked in and sat down on a bench. I kept looking over thinking I should either complain about him or offer to buy him food... I would decide after I was done eating. (The guy wasn't bothering anybody but I think I was mildly annoyed that none of the staff noticed him.) Out of nowhere the homeless man got up and started coming towards us and instead went to the counter where one of the older gentlemen that worked there had left the man a box full of food. The homeless man took the food, bowed thank you and left. Very awesome that they do this type of thing on a regular basis since the homeless man never spoke a word about wanting food and they seemed to have a routine. Would defs go back for the food and for the feeling of a moral compass polishing. I also liked the pork katsu curry way more (spice 4) than the chicken katsu curry (spice 3). PS the garlic sauce condiment is bomb, ask the homeless guy. (jk)"}
{"text":"The northside of town is notorious for fast food chains and other quick-eat type of eateries, with only a handful of mom-and-pop restaurants sprinkled throughout the area. Tokyo Cafe brings a bit of what's offered to Chinatown without the 15-20 minute drive.   Tonkotsu: Generous amounts of thick noodles, slices of chashu, a soft boiled egg, slices of green onions, and an over abundance of bamboo shoots bathed in a hot, milky-colored broth. Although the broth had that oily fattiness, its flavor didn't have depth.   Miso: The miso ramen that my boyfriend ordered was reminiscent to a shoyu ramen with a richer, saltier flavor.  Gyoza: Our bill was over $25, so we received complimentary gyoza, which makes for a good shareable appetizer.   If ramen and gyoza aren't your thing, there are also other items on the menu, such as a variety of curries.   I have to give props to the service. The staff here works incredibly hard to run this establishment and keep patrons happy.   Tokyo Cafe is worth the try if you're in the area looking for something to eat that isn't at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good broth. Tonkatsu is on point. It is not something that will blow your mind away but it is very good. Noodles were good and not overcooked as well as the boiled egg. Milk tea was also great.  Service is awesome and the people are polite and very nice.  Im so glad there is a place like this in North las Vegas.    Had the spicy tonkatsu and it was sooooooo goooooooooood!!!!"}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive ramen..... Got the Tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles and extra Chashu it was great!! Huge servings too....."}
{"text":"We ordered Tonkatsu Ramen, chicken teriyaki and pork katsu curry... it's all yummy!!! So glad we have this amazing restaurant just minutes away from the house. Delicious food, reasonably priced, fast and generous servings. We will definitely be  a regular customer"}
{"text":"Got the tonkatsu ramen and teriyaki bowl, decent, nothing special. If you're looking for legit Japanese food this won't live up to your standards. However, if you don't feel like driving to Chinatown for good ramen this place will do.  The service was ok, cashier was kind of rude to me. The ambiance is eh, could look a little better in there."}
{"text":"I eat alot of ramen and alot of curry.. but i must say my first time trying their ramen and curry.. its nothing like i ever tasted. The ramen is rich and flavor and the curry is just amazing. Must try"}
{"text":"Delicous Thai tea and the Tonkotsu soup is on point! Make sure you get extra chonshu."}
{"text":"Come here regularly. I'd rather come here than go to Chinatown for my ramen. They get the job done and overall, I've never left unsatisfied. The ramen portions are huge. I honestly wish they had a half size portion. Teriyaki chicken is great. I would prefer this place over Teriyaki Madness. So if you're craving ramen and on the north side of town, come here!"}
{"text":"A sham of a Japanese restaurant with Chinese owners. The chicken katsudon curry was barely adequate, saved by the (still subpar) thai tea with boba. Good prices, open kind of late, not great if you've tried the real deal before. Won't return except for the boba maybe."}
{"text":"I went to go eat with my boyfriend. We both love it! The ramen is delicious and flavorful. Yet my boyfriend and I ordered different types of soups but they tasted the same to us. Regardless, they were both good. The servings of the soup are very large. My boyfriend and I were very full that we didn't even finish our broth. We had a nice man ring us up. He asked us if we wanted our soup spicy or not (which I recommend a little spicy). After charging us, the food came to us very quickly. He brought our food to our table. He was very kind.  Regardless, I'm only giving Tokyo Cafe 4/5 stars because the boba in this location is disappointing. I ordered the Milk Tea, it was alright. It tasted very similar to iced coffee with boba. But yet, I have tasted better. Also when we were done with our ramen, I ordered a second boba (to go) for my sister. I ordered the Coconut boba. It was truly disgusting. It tasted like evaporated milk from the can. I kid you not, that coconut boba tasted EXACTLY like that. I wish I would have known it was gross when I was at the restaurant. I would have gotten another flavor.   To add to the second boba order. I had a bitter Asian woman ring me up. She was so rude to me for no reason. (Mind you this was BEFORE I knew the coconut boba was gross). I work in food service as well and I have always treated my customers with kindness and respect."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews of this place. We came here for something different and got mediocre.  The service was great, it was the food that needed help.  We ordered a teriyaki beef plate that the menu said came with mixed vegetables and rice and Tonkotsu Ramen.  This was the first time we had ever had Ramen and my fiance said he liked it but it wasn't the greatest. It comes with pork, egg, seaweed and mushrooms but lacked flavor.  My teriyaki didn't come with vegetables (which is why I ordered it) but rather a small iceberg salad. I asked the girl about the veggies and she said that they changed that some time ago.  Wish I knew that before ordering.  The beef was a little tough and the sauce was ok. I have better at Samarai Sam's (sorry, I know that is totally wrong!) and Yogi's. Next time we will venture to China Town for some yummy Japanese ;-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots near my house.  Fast service.  The ramen soups they have are really good and I prefer the tonkasu ramen even though the broth isn't as thick as it should be. The teriyaki plates are amazing so don't sleep on them big serving.  Cheap and affordable food.  Also if you get some ramen save the broth when your done with the noodles and ask for a noodle refill then boom! A whole bowl of ramen all over again. Not as good as other ramen shops in Vegas but it's probably the best your gonna find near nellis afb.  I do recommend! Go go go!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am the odd ball but did not care for this place very much.  Had the miso ramen to go an I felt like my noodles were more like spaghetti.  Couldn't put my finger on an over powering aftertaste.  Lackluster interior appeal as well.  Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I had their tonkatsu ramen and taro boba and they were both amazing! This is going to be a regular spot for me. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great little place for great ramen. Close to work so I just pop in order my food and off I go. Very fast service. The ramen has so much noodles and it's so delish. I always get the Miso Ramen. This time I'm trying the curry Udon. So good!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for some Japanese Curry, on the North side of town, of course. I work at Nellis, so this is the closest best Japanese restaurant. I can say, we order food from here once a week. I would have gave 5 stars, but you have to pay extra for more curry $1.99, they hold back on the curry. This is the closest thing to Curryhouse, Coco Ichibanya."}
{"text":"So I was trying a new spot for Ramen and so fat so good ... my favorite is the shoyu flavor it was a lathe portion of food the only thing I did not like was that it was really salty so I had to dilute my broth a abit otherwise pretty good"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little place for some sort of Asian food it's not completely Japanese is the name Tokyo would insinuate but it was damn tasty the curry chicken was delicious and in the goyza was the best I've ever had my entire life"}
{"text":"I went to Tokyo Café for the first time this evening. It was really really good. The katsu was pleasantly crunchy. The pork was lean and tender.  The curry was perfectly spicy. I received a very generous portion. The customer service was friendly and fast. Tokyo cafe is in my neighborhood.  I will go again. The reason I am no giving them a 5 is because the decor is a little shabby. Clean very clean but shabby. Nice family vibe though. Give them a try."}
{"text":"You know the head crud that's been going around? The nasty, runny, stuffy, coughing, pounding, can't breathe - just - want - to - die cold that's been taking us all down? Yeah, well it got me on Thursday, so I #obvi needed some ramen in my life. Living in the North, this really isn't a great problem to have....except I remembered seeing that Tokyo Cafe offered ramen, and they're pretty new....so why not?  When we arrived, we were the only people in the whole place. The place smelled like Pine Sol - and I could think of at least 78 things that smell worse than Pine Sol in a restaurant - so far so good. The staff was super friendly. Their menu offerings are listed on the back wall (not all spelled correctly, but we could totally get the gist). I ordered the shoyu ramen, seaweed salad, fried gyoza and a teriyaki chicken bowl to go. The bill was under $30.   As we waited for our food, I checked into Yelp and two people came in - they were clearly excited to order, and kept talking about what they got last time versus what their friend Karen got here every time, and maybe they would also try this....it was reassuring to hear people talking so positively about a place when we were the only ones there at dinner time.   The food came out in a cardboard box - which I have never had happen before - it was fun. The guy went through the order to make sure nothing was missing, and when he realized the nori wasn't there, he ran back to get it for us.   When we got home, we found that the noodles were packaged separately from the broth - brilliant. They weren't bloated and overcooked - they were just right when I added them in. They had a pre-made texture to them, definitely didn't feel fresh on the palate - but I was not complaining, because the broth made my body feel well and I liked the flavor. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. The gyoza was good, too! Not too spicy, not greasy at all - actually quite a treat. My husband, who by-the-way loves chicken teriyaki bowls, says that this is the best he's ever had. The chicken was plentiful, it came with a salad, and he was shocked at the serving size - saying 'If this is a bowl, I can't imagine what a plate looks like!' I saved the seaweed salad and half of my ramen for the following day, as I spent it home from work on the couch, and it was the perfect way to start my day.   We'll be back over and over again. It's not Monta Ramen, but it's great in a pinch. We were incredibly pleased with what we found here. Thanks for coming to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good Ramen for a good price. We have tried all their ramen options and was not disappointed, They were delicious. For a quick ramen fix I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Tokyo cafe. Came here around 1230 yesterday. The place was full and the kitchen was cooking up a storm. This place reminds me so much of those hole in the wall places in Okinawa. Ordered a spicy miso ramen for takeout. In less than 15mins we were out the door. Everyone was super friendly too. Couldn't wait to get home to inhale my ramen. I was surprised by how much food there was. The broth was pretty good but I think it needs a little more miso. FYI, they are not kidding about the \"spicy\" part. It is spicy good. I liked that they had the noodles in a separate container.  So glad we have a ramen place in our side of town now. No more trips to Chinatown for my ramen cravings. Their prices are very affordable too.   We'll be back. Next time I'm going to try their tonkotsu ramen and some gyoza and maybe a boba too. I give Tokyo Cafe a 4.5."}
{"text":"Good prices' and the food is delicious. They do not have a huge verity of food but they have a small selection of great food."}
{"text":"This place is so good I can hardly stand it. I live in north vegas and to be honest I am pretty doubtful of any ramen place not on Spring Mountain but damn am I SO EXCITED to have found this place.  I like it better that you go to the front to order like any fast food joint, free soda refills, etc good start. Ordered Miso Ramen (basic white weeboo bitch fave) no veggies and 2 eggs (most places think 1 egg is half an egg), extra noodles and a soda. Overall close to 15 bucks, not bad.  I wait at thier bar thing in the back, took less than 8 minutes i sware, and they bring this MONSTER BOWL OUT. I was so excited and ate damn near all of it. Also apparently they really give you a whole egg here so i have 2 whole friggen eggs AND IT EVEN COMES WITH A HALF EGG ALREADY. BEST, FUCKING, THING, OF MY LIFE.  Noodles were fa tastic, broth a little salty but was amazing.   Not only will I be coming back but I will also crown Tokyo Cafe my FAVORITE ramen house in the city. Bu bye Spring Mountain hello Craig."}
{"text":"Tried the tempura udon, came with 3 shrimp and the normal assortment of veggies but it was the size of a full order that I've seen at most places.  The udon was flat out the best I've had of the 4 places I have had it. I will be returning soon for the ramen."}
{"text":"It was Date Night with the wifey and we couldn't decide to go down to Chinatown for some chow OR take a risk and go to the other side of Craig Road to give Tokyo Café a go.  Glad we did, this place is the little engine that could!  Somehow in all my years here, I have rarely ventured past The Cannery Hotel & Casino on that side of town.  This was a first in a long time.  Located just past The Cannery but right before the freeway sits unassuming, little Tokyo Café.  When we went for dinner, place was really empty, maybe only two other tables were occupied at the time.  But I shouldn't have worried because Tokyo Café is a good place to eat!  Restaurant itself is quaint but nice and newly painted.  Reminds me of a place where you can hang out with your friends and read anime.  Japanese-y.  Service though was spot on comforting.  We were greeted warmly by two little Asian fellas (yes they were little and NO I'm not being racist) who I am assuming were the owners of the place.  One is the front of the house runner/cashier, other was the cook in the kitchen.  Menu is very small but thankfully it is focused on serving Japanese food only.  I really didn't want to go to Tokyo Café and see Orange Chicken and Beef Broccoli on the menu, like many Asian-type restaurants do to appease the more American fan base.  The most important things are on the menu at Tokyo Café - ramen & rice.  Oh so nice.  Wifey is not a big fan of ramen (thinks lots of them are just TOO salty) but she opted for a bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.99) with extra noodles ($1.59) because it was a bit chilly.  I'm a huge fan of anything katsu and curry, so I ordered their Chicken Katsu Curry plate ($6.99).  For checking in with Yelp, we also got a free serving of edamame.  Ah, the perks of being a Yelper.  Food overall wasn't fancy, but it was good on taste!  Wifey said her ramen was tasty because it wasn't so salty but still flavorful, and the noodles weren't soggy.  Our server noticed that there was too many noodles in her bowl and proceeded to immediately get us another bowl with more tonkatsu broth inside.  He said, \"Too much noodles but not enough soup, so I bring another bowl for you.\"  Very polite and much appreciated!  Ramen was not skimpy on toppings either - had a generous amount of roasted pork, nori, menma (pickled bamboo shoots), and soft boiled egg in it.  And with the extra noodles, more than enough food for two people to share!  Wifey ate half the bowl and passed the other serving over to me, which I finished with aplomb.  My Chicken Katsu Curry fit the bill.  The portion was just big enough for me.  Two nicely golden brown pieces of chicken katsu, a small portion of steamed veggies, a bowl of curry, and another bowl with steamed rice.  Katsu was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all.  Curry may or may not have been from the package, but it's hard for me to tell.  No matter though because curry from scratch is a pretty daunting and time-consuming task.  Great dish for less than $7!  I ate all of it without barely leaving a grain of rice left on my plate.  Good surprise here was the Thai Milk Tea with Boba.  I don't normally drink boba because it's often too sweet with all that added sugar.  But the one from Tokyo Café was delicious!  Refreshing!  Just the way I like it, strong tea flavor, light on sugar and milk, lots of ice.  I wish refills were free.  We will be going to Tokyo Café again down the line.  Place is a nice gem in the North part of town.  Hope it stays around for a while.  Oishi!"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with \"north town\" of Las Vegas, you know about the limited amount of food choices you will find in this area! Having a ramen spot in this area is pretty cool, so of course I had to try it! Ambience is very casual. Fortunately, I have been spoiled by the awesomeness of other ramen places in the city.. so I thought this place was okay. The flavor was alright, pork in the soup was tough, and it was a little too salty overall for my liking. I'll have to come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"No need to drive down Spring Mountain/Flamingo! The Curry Udon tastes really good. The ramens are as good as those in Spring Mt as well. Don't forget to add those garlic paste on your ramen soup."}
{"text":"Loved the spicy tampora battered chicken, shrimp, and spam. That spicy curry just puts it over the top."}
{"text":"The Shoya Ramen and the Tempura Vegetables were Spot on.    Other guest got the Chicken Katsu Curry.  Everything was excellent. Very fast service.  Will be back!!!! ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I had the ramen noodle soup with the chicken. Piping hot and full of flavor. The service was nice from the guy who brought my food but the girl who took my order was pretty indifferent and didn't even look at me none the less the food was great"}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu Curry and chicken teriyaki were so tasty. Large portions. Food came out quick. Good quality. Friendly staff. Can't wait to try the ramen next!"}
{"text":"It's just down the road from the Cannery--I stopped for dinner after a movie.  Not fancy, but the food is good.  Short menu--appetizers, udon, ramen, teriyaki, curry.  I had pork katsu curry and fried gyoza. Yeah, the cutlets are thin, but they give you two which is fair for the price. I liked the flavor of the curry. The dipping sauce for the gyoza is nice and strong. I'd call the price of a meal '$$', though--an entree, drink, and one other item will cost around $15."}
{"text":"I Iove the spicy miso ramen here, especially how they package it to go. It's a huge portion that lasts a few meals because they package the noodles separately, unlike  a few other places in town. Great find in North Las Vegas! Give them a shot."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food (ramen, curry, etc) this side of town.  Comparable to Japan...I know, I've been there!"}
{"text":"First time eating Ramen besides the $.20 store bought ones, the food was very reasonably priced & you get a hearty serving. Of course I had to be greedy and add extra noodles to mine (big mistake!) I thought I was going to blow up! I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen spicy, but you can order inot spicy also. It was so full of flavor, the pork belly had an awkward taste to me but my husband & son thought it was good. The only negative about the place was the lady at the register. She literally had no personality! She seemed annoyed by us asking what some of the items were on the menu & at the time we were the only people there, so it's not like we were holding up the line? However the gentleman that brought out our food was very friendly. I'd definitely return, angry lady or not!"}
{"text":"First off... We arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the lady at the counter was very welcoming. You know when you go to a restaurant and the staff acts annoyed... That sucks! Not this guys, they were very nice.   Now the food...   I had the chicken curry, it is completely different than Thai or Chinese. It was a lightly breaded chicken breast, it was light and flaky and crunchy. It was served with white rice and curry gravy. I ordered it medium spice. I poured the gravy over everything... It is delicious! It was very well priced as well. My friend had the beef fried udon that also was delicious!  We're here in Las Vegas for a short time... We'll be hitting this place again."}
{"text":"Great ramen, katsu and curry. They give you Alot I ordered one fried rice and it took down my entire family. Everything was perfect I will be back."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. It looks a little sketchy in appearance, like they aren't done with the remodeling or something. The windows are dirty and such. Kinda scary. But this review is about the food. The food was every bit of 5 stars. Don't let the appearance fool you, the food is really good!"}
{"text":"A mom and pop looking restaurant with good ramen? Don't judge a book by its cover!  I ordered for a party of 12ish to go and was already getting anxious that my order would be messed up. We ordered ramen, chicken katsu, and some milk teas.  The gentleman taking my order was patient and before we hung up, he reread all my orders to me with the correct add ins and omitted ingredients for each order.  The ramen is separated from the broth, and your seaweed is also packaged separately. For the katsu, the curry is separate and if you don't know how spicy they will make it, you can ask for it on the side as well.  I appreciate the separation of everything without having to request for it.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with an extra egg and spicy. The ramen is not over cooked so it still has the chew to it - just the way it should be. One of my eggs was completely cooked through while the other one still had a semi-cooked yolk, which I love!   The broth is savory and exactly how I asked for it: spicy. It's a good spice where your nose is running at the end of the bowl but doesn't make you cry or prevent you from eating more throughout. The broth has bamboo shoots, mushrooms (I want to say it's wood eat mushrooms? I could be wrong), and two slices of melt in your mouth chasu pork! I wish there was more pork but I could do without it.  My taro milk tea was average, nothing fancy. $3.99 for a cup though is a bit pricey but their cups are like larges for OC milk tea.  Overall, my family's ramen cravings were satisfied and I think we're all glad this place was near our weekend stay in North LV :)"}
{"text":"I always forget to take pictures before I eat. I always end up being hungry... Which is why I'm there... And I just dive into my food.   So, this place. I just found it and I'm glad I did. It's pretty great.   Ordered two chicken Teriyaki bowls, a beef Teriyaki plate, and a shoyou Ramen bowl with an extra egg.   The chicken Teriyaki was pretty good, loads of rice and chunky veggies. Kids enjoyed it. Even the picky one.    Beef plate had plenty of meat and a little bowl of rice. Was not enough for the hubby, but lucky the kids didn't finish and he filled up.   My soup came with two seaweed sheets, a bit of mushrooms, some bamboo shoots (that I convinced the childrens to try because they might turn into pandas. ) and some pork that I promptly shuffled to the littlest who offered a \"Humm, um YUMM!\" I found the soup to be a bit saltier than I'd like, but had some good flavor.   All in all, it's not Monta, but I'd return."}
{"text":"Very nice people.  Food was super salty.  I left more than half the bowl of soup because it was just inedible.  Love ramen but not from this place.  Fail."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Try your Ramen (Tonkatsu for me) spicy, but only if you are REALLY ready for the heat. The Chicken Katsu curry was excellent, and portion size was more than generous. Tofu Katsu curry was just as tasty. What it may lack in atmosphere, Tokyo Cafe is an incredible find. Perfect lunch or early dinner choice."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki bowl! It was very good. But they put a lot of sauce. I would recommend to have the sauce on the side. I also got the Taro milk tea!! This was awesome!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting or wants to try food!"}
{"text":"I was SHOCKED to find such a solid noodle house this far north!   Everything I got was absolutely as good as I'm used to getting on Spring Mountain, and I'm going back as often as I can!   I don't leave many Yelp reviews, but the food here shocked me into breaking my streak.  Next time I come, I'll be trying their boba as well, as that would save me even more driving if it's nearly as good as their food!"}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen I've ever had outside Japan! It's run by two older Japanese men who wear the traditional Japanese chef head covers and talk to each other in Japanese.  The menu is quite simple: four kinds of ramen, a few other dishes, and some appetizers/sides. The service is quick, the prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious!  I recently spent five days in Las Vegas and ended up eating dinner there twice because it was so good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a ramen place nearby, and happen to find this place on yelp! I've heard good reviews from a relative, and decided to try this place out. We ordered shoyu ramen, and it was so good! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were so chewy and delicious! It felt like I was in Chinatown for a second lol! We also tried the chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki plate and my kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Ah finally a decently tasty Asian lunch option near my work! There's honestly not too much to chose from around this area other then fast food so a place that offers ramen, udon, tempura vegetables and a few other options is very refreshing.   Overall the esthetic of this place isn't super snazzy, but the food is good. When you walk in there's several tables and a self service drink area. You place your order at the counter in the front and then they bring it out to your table once it's ready. The employees are very friendly and the service is pretty quick even during lunch time.  As for the food I can't complain. The portion sizes are huge and the prices are very reasonable. I opted for the tonkasu spicy ramen this time around and it was very good. I loved the broth flavor and they definitely don't skimp on the other toppings. A great little hidden gem in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food! They have huge portions! Each order is good for 2 people. We love their chicken katsu curry. We ordered a medium spice and the spiciest level, and they're great! They're gyoza is one my favorites.  They also have yakisoba or 'fried soba.' It's quite oily, but still delicious. They put a lot of vegetables in it. We also ordered their shoyu ramen and chicken teriyaki. Everything is good and the price is great! We always order to-go, because their place is small. When we ordered the ramen, they separated the soup, so it's still good when we ate at home. Ordering on the phone is fast and easy. They are very friendly!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of ramen coming from the north side of Vegas this is where it's at. Saves a drive to Chinatown and I'm definitely all about keeping my money local. This is a mom n pop type joint, ate the miso ramen and added chashu as an extra. Ran roughly a little over ten bucks. I'd have to say for being in an unexpected location the soup is pretty damn good. Presentation was awesome and if you spend over 25$ you get a free order of Gyoza. As I'm writing this I'm still eating the soup broth, give this place a shot; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dont judge the book by its cover. This place has Awesome food! Order ramen, Teriyaki , udon, and curry."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in town to get ramen. I constantly crave it!!! And the curry is fantastic. The level 3 spice curry is perfect. This is mine and my fiances go to place."}
{"text":"So happy there's a place like this outside of the immediate vicinity of Chinatown!!  Though I don't live in Vegas anymore, I'm glad I can have access to some real Japanese food when I'm staying at my mom's!  I studied abroad in Tokyo for a couple months and Tokyo Cafe reminds you that Japanese food doesn't need to be complicated to be yummy!   Tonkatsu ramen is my favorite! Om nom nom."}
{"text":"I ordered the soba chicken and the chicken  fried rice.  Its very yummy.  I am now a regular.  I am hooked on the rice as of now"}
{"text":"Taro tea with boba is fire.  Best boba in town.  Ramen noodle soup is good.  Chicken Katsu curry is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is visually seen from Craig Rd. Can't miss it, lots of parking. The menu is simple and to the point. I was actually shocked about the prices especially with how large the portions are. Def alot of bang for your buck. The food was really good. Got a Teriyaki Bowl that came with a salad, and Chicken Katsu with medium curry. Very friendly staff. You can dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"Always love this place!  Food feels homemade and large servings; always enough to share. Chicken fried rice, spam katsu and curry,sea weed salad are always a good go to. They also have good picked ginger as a condiment."}
{"text":"The family was craving for some ramen and we had heard good things about this place. The ramen reminded the kids of the ramen in Okinawa. Wonderful food."}
{"text":"Tokyo Cafe is the most recent business to give it a try in this tenant space.  I remember this address being a Guamanian restaurant, an Italian/Chinese restaurant, a wannabe Panda Express restaurant, and now it's a Japanese restaurant.  This is potentially the best one of the bunch.  For those of you living in North Las Vegas, the most significant thing about Tokyo Cafe is that (to my knowledge) they are the only ones serving a \"real\" bowl of ramen in this part of town.  Choice of tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso broths, chashu pork, soft boild eggs, seaweed, bamboo shoots; it's mostly all there.  I've had the miso ramen, which actually looked and tasted like a shoyu ramen.  The broth had decent but light flavor, which had me adding plenty of garlic and togarashi.  The chashu was tender, small in portion, and light on flavor.  Noodles were overcooked and past al dente.  The menu also offers some other noodle dishes, and some curry dishes, along with a few appetizers.  Based on the one dish I've had, I can at least take it for what it is, and acknowledge that this is probably the best/only choice for ramen in North Las Vegas.  It was decent enough that I'll be sure to return and try their other offerings; otherwise, make the drive out to Chinatown for full satisfaction."}
{"text":"nice people good food?gonna come again??I ordered chicken curry for myself and Raman for my boyfriend. And one Thai tea, one boba milk tea. It's all good! I love the chicken curry it's the best I tasted ever. lovely place"}
{"text":"No a/c No to go menus nothing to write about besides a mom and pop no frills limited menu no fluctuation on the dishes GOOD for what they offer. Like an In & Out simplicity. Appetizers a little pricey for what you get. Plenty of rice if you get a dish that includes rice. Remember the star rating for yelp...tooo many 5 stars given for no reason...3 is A-OK nothing bad about 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu was crispy and the tempura was not oily. The portion sizes are very big and the curry spices were on point.  The fried rice was a little bland and the teriyaki sauce was a little watery.  Overall good for katsu curry if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Local and tasty. If you are in the area give it a try. The prices aren't bad and the food is good. Don't travel far to come here, as Chinatown has the same stuff at a good price."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a fairly quick bite. I got the chicken katsu curry with udon noodles with a side of miso soup. The curry dish was delicious. Very simple but delicious. Udon and chicken was soft. Great amount of everything. The miso soup could've been hotter. It was lukewarm and I really needed something hot to hit the spot after a long night out. Other than that, food was great and the curry udon satisfied my hunger!"}
{"text":"This place is a personal favorite, it's quiet and has fast service. I find myself here more and more often, all of the curry options are amazing. The veggie tempura is a steal at $4 (you get about 14 pieces!) The dishes are huge for the price and quality is never sacrificed. Toyko Cafe is without a doubt the best Japanese resturant for your money!"}
{"text":"The curry here is pretty delicious I must say! The portion size also is good for the price. But the only thing that's missing is spicier chili powder. =/"}
{"text":"We ordered the tonkatsu ramen from here as a to go order. The broth was very flavorful and rich, and the eggs were cooked with the most perfect yolk. The menu is simple and the order came out quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout food, which turned out to taste fine... nothing fantastic.  However, if I would have driven around looking for a place to eat, I would have turned away at the front door.  It looked filthy from the outside and not too much better on the inside."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a few people today, had the taro milk boba tea and tofu katsu. The sauce was yummy and the boba tea is one of the best I've had. The man who presented our food to us was nice and friendly, cashier who took our order seemed a little on the serious side but that's just nitpicking no biggie, I'll be back for sure. Yumm!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! So glad we have someplace on the north side that serves great Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Ramen is forever changed for me. Great choices in Ramen and other dishes as well. A must try if your out in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been craving ramen for quite some time and Tokyo Cafe has proven they are experts in their craft. They have a miso, soy and pork base broth to chose from and then you get to select any extras. The bowls are HUGE, the meat is tender and the ramen is seasoned to perfection. Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Finally, a nearby Ramen place. We had the steamed gyoza, miso ramen, chicken teriyaki, Thai tea boba, and mango boba. Everything was delicious! Portions were huge. The hubby lived in Japan for several years and is critical of ramen (knowing what good ramen is like), but he was happy with his tonight.! Staff was really nice. Will be back again to try some of the other things on my menu."}
{"text":"The curry sauce! Oh they could serve it on a flip flop and I would eat it! Yes it is THAT GOOD. Haven't tested much of the menu but I am hooked."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Japanese food at a great price!!!  Having lived in Japan for 2 years, I can say this place is legit!  I've been several times and tried something new each time and have never been disappointed.  This is going to be one of my regular places for a long time!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy food! Good little place out in North Vegas they have yummy sauces. Good service and food got to out table fast!! Everything is clean and they clean up the table after you. Simple menu is nice so you just get good food"}
{"text":"We've been trying to come out to Tokyo Café since August when we moved to NLV.  Something always comes up, and so yesterday, when my husband wasn't feeling well and having a serious craving for ramen, we decided to head over to try it out.  Given all the amazing reviews, we had pretty high hopes, and I have to say, I was impressed.   The location is small, but bright and tidy, and service was quick and very polite.  Tokyo Café has a small menu, but honestly, I still felt overwhelmed with choices!!  What did I want to try out this time?  Curry?  Ramen?  I wanted both!   We decided on: Tonkatsu Ramen Curry Udon with Shrimp Steamed Gyoza Seaweed Salad  My husband wasn't quite as enthusiastic about everything as I was.  He has his favorite ramen place, and nothing can beat that in his opinion.  He enjoyed everything though.  Me, on the other hand...I thought everything was delicious. The curry udon:  breaded butterflied shrimp served over a THICK curry sauce and perfect udon noodles.  This was awesome.  I've never met an udon I didn't like, but I really, truly enjoyed this.  It stayed piping hot till it was almost all gone (because the curry sauce was so thick!).  The shrimp was cooked well.  The noodles were perfect.  I asked for a level 0 spiciness, and I'm glad I did.  The curry had a bit of heat to it that built up really nicely.  I'm a wimp with spice, so the gentle build was perfect.    The ramen:  The broth was SO light, and delicate.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  Really tasty.  I didn't try the meat, but I never eat meat in my ramen.  This was really good.    The seaweed salad:  Really tasty.  Only complaint was that it was cut into super small pieces that made eating the last bits a little difficult.  But the taste was incredible.    The steamed gyoza:  Tasty.  I've had better, and the gyoza sauce tasted and smelled strongly of vinegar.    We also, on the way out, ordered a Thai tea with no boba, and a taro tea with boba.   Both were delicious, and the boba was prepared really well.    All in all, I'm pleased with the visit.  We will most definitely be back.  I can't wait to try some more items!"}
{"text":"We drove by this place and very surprised their food is better than 5 star restaurants.  I have a new favorite place to go"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star place.  Food was good - very good, you get a lot, and pretty affordable... $6-9 depending on what you order.  We had the chicken and beef plate, katsu curry, and vegetable udon.  Definitely a go to place if you're looking for a quick and affordable fix... just like crystal meth."}
{"text":"A good spot for some ramen if you don't want to drive out to chinatown. Coming back for more ramen later"}
{"text":"Having lived in Hokkaido a few years from late teens to early twenties I always love to try Japanese places. This is real Japanese food. Nothing crazy, but real Japanese food. Very simple menu. Generous portions. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place really is a 3.5 star restaurant. It wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad, I would definitely come back again. I just don't understand the 4.5 star rating?   We got the tonkatsu ramen and the pork tonkatsu curry. They were both good just nothing special. The cha shu in the ramen was really good just kinda thin and the soup was good too. The curry itself was good as well and surprisingly very spicy! I usually ask for spicy curry and it's just ok spicy but this was on fire.   This place is definitely worth a try especially since it's very well priced."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place 5 stars because there's literally nothing to complain about. Just the fact that we finally have a good Japanese ramen/curry/boba cafe in North Vegas is reason enough lol. I ordered the fried gyoza and edamame as appetizers, tonkatsu ramen for myself and chicken katsu curry for my boyfriend, and two thai teas. Total was $27 and got another free order of fried gyzoza for spending over $25. Nothing is pricey and all portions are huge. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Welcome to North Las Vegas where Chinese/Japanese food isn't really Chinese/Japanese. In order to keep business afloat, I understand that you must adapt to what customers want. This isn't Chinatown where Asian restaurants compete with each other. Craig Road has Panda Express, Sakura and Tokyo Cafe...offer food for cheap in order to compete.  This was once a Quizno's then became Pasta China and something else. We came here and the place was empty. They offer free edamame with your Yelp check-in. I didn't claim mine.  Thai Tea with Boba: I'm pretty sure they don't brew their own tea but it still tastes like Thai tea and didn't have that chalky taste to it. The balls were kind of hard and chewy. 3/5  Katsu Curry: You can get tofu, chicken,shrimp or pork. We tried the chicken and pork. Both were super thin. The curry was marginal. It comes with veggies and white rice. You can get brown rice for like $1 extra. 3/5  Chicken Teriyaki: Thin pieces of chicken drenched with salty teriyaki sauce. I should have asked for sauce on the side instead. 2/5  For $6/entree, it's not bad if you're in the area desperate for some milk tea, ramen and Japanese curry. If you're looking for something more authentic, this is not it. However, the service was good."}
{"text":"only went in for some boba. the older guy was nice and pleasing. the taro milk tea slushee boba is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, The ramen is fantastic and the price is right. I cant say much about the other dishes other than I tried the Katsu and it was ok and had great Curry Sauce that came with it.. I say only ok because its not my thing. But I have tried the three Ramens which are Miso, Shuyo, and Tonkatsu which by far is my favorite. I usually always get the ramen spicy and it chokes me up from time to time. The owners are fantastic and they work everyday and have a passion for the business. They also offer specialty drinks such as Boba, Tea and other import sugary beverages and coffee."}
{"text":"I've been finding myself craving tonkatsu ramen at least once a week. Its hard to give this place any less than 5 stars. It seems to be getting a bit busier around lunch each time I go. Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best Ramen  in Vegas, especially for the price. The dash taste just like home (Hawaii) & husband agreed. He order the tonkatsu curry  which he loved for the price too. I love the atmosphere here, very simple menu & setting reminds me of notsunoya back home!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is always great, and the food is delicious. My personal favorite everytime I come here is the tonkatsu ramen, and everytime I eat it I'm never disappointed. They even take precautions when making it a to-go order and put the noodles in a separate container to keep them from getting soggy! Couldn't ask for a better place to go to for lunch."}
{"text":"The ramen was mediocre. The establishment wasn't very clean. The employees weren't friendly. (The cooks in back were making fun of the few customers that they had) I won't be returning. Skip this place and try another. Theirs plenty of ramen places around."}
{"text":"Great place. Got the cold sobs tempura. Came with a plate of cold soba with a broth to dip and another plate of shrimp and veg tempura with same broth. Broth wasn't too salty, the tempura was nice and warm/crispy but not over cooked. Noodles were great with a side of green onions and wasabi to add to the broth. All for $8!!!  Great lunch place."}
{"text":"My wife and I love food.  We have been looking for boba places on the north side for awhile now and she came across this place.  She mentioned to me they serve Ramen too and I was ecstatic because I have been craving it.  This appears to be a mom and pop shop and was very quaint. I forgot I was in vegas for the time I was in there.  A rated health placard on this date 9/3/2016 Service was friendly Food came out fast and it was very delicious Prices are fair for the amount of Food"}
{"text":"We finally arrived! Considering we live 5 minutes away. We came in on a Sunday, but found a note that read they are no longer open on Sundays--darn! Anyway, we tried again on a weekday and there were a couple families eating. It is a pretty limited seating area, but I don't forsee anyone having to wait for seating because I can't imagine it getting THAT busy in here.   The service was friendly so first impression--good. I ordered the shoyu ramen and the hubby had the tonkatsu. I seriously felt as if there wasn't a clear distinction between the two. My husband's broth almost tasted like my broth vice versa. I also didn't enjoy the brand of seaweed they used. I love shoyu ramen, however, I didn't love it here.  I think it's great that we have a ramen spot on this side of town because it saves the drive. As I always say...go in and have a try for yourself as everyday is a different one and perhaps I just caught them on a wrong day. I don't think I'd ever be back, and would prefer to drive into Chinatown for my ramen crave. But...if I wanted to catch a ramen fix, save a drive, and perhaps save a waiting time the other ramen spots will have you doing, jusssst maybe I'd consider it.  On a positive note, my husband enjoyed his. So just maybe I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best Asian cuisine takeout meals I've had. I got the spicy chicken katsu curry. The sauce was so smooth and tasty yet spicy, the chicken was the perfect consistency, and the lemon pepper salad was a great side dish. I wish I wasn't vacationing and could go back!"}
{"text":"Today, I took my family to try this for the first time. The kid working in the front was so unprofessional and rude. I ordered a boba drink and he looked at me like I wasn't going to pay for it. I You guys need to get rid of him. Now my family has a bad taste in their mouth from being in a place where there weren't any common courtesy."}
{"text":"I've tried pretty much everything on their menu & they are ALL amazing. Today I had the chicken katsu curry SPICY. If you've eaten at Curry Zen, I would rate the spice level at a 6 compared to Curry Zen. The fact that this place is way closer to home than Curry Zen makes me happy. If you're a ramen, curry, soba lover; you must come here! & the service is excellent !! They're always so nice and deliver the food to your table."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Friendly staff, fast service, and simple menu with great food and boba drinks.  I've tried the Chicken Katsu Curry, Fried Gyoza, Tonkotsu Ramen (Spicy), Thai Tea w/ Boba, and Taro Milk Tea w/Boba and can recommend them all.  Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"By far best noodles I've had , I'm always trying new places and find myself always coming back here and ordering tonkotsu ramen level 3spicy!!  Has to be my place of choice for Japanese ramen"}
{"text":"Very good Japanese Ramen, especially for North Las Vegas. The Fried Gyoza are a solid appetizer. I really liked the dipping sauce. For the Ramen, I had both the Miso and the Tonkotsu. The Miso was good, but I definitely preferred the Tonkotsu, especially spicy. I wish I had ordered extra Chashu, it was very tasty."}
{"text":"If you like Ramen noodles then this is for you. Had Noodles with some pork in them and an extra egg. Good protein for those bulking up :-) anyways I kind of regret not getting spicy because those looked really good as well. Anyways regular was super tasty so I'll have to save that for another time. Great food at great prices. Next tim I'll try some of the fried shrimp and calamari also. Those looked soo good! Will be back.  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday 9-14-15 around 5:30 PM to get some takeout.  The cafe is located on the corner of losee and craig in the shopping center across from Sam's Club.  The ambiance is casual, not as clean as I'd like, but the staff was friendly and the food came out within 20 minutes.    $6.99 Chicken Katsu Curry- PLENTY of rice, a nice-sized container of runny curry that was packaged separately, and the chicken was hot, crispy, and tender, if not a bit bland. I much prefer the version at Curry Zen.  There was also a pile of cabbage in the corner of the container that had began to turn.  Lovely garnish, thanks.    $6.99 Shoyu Ramen - When you get it to-go the noodles are packaged separately from the broth, and the seaweed is separated as well.  I appreciate the thought that went into that.  There was a half an egg in mine and two pieces of unknown meat.  The noodles have a great firm texture. The broth was mild.  It seems very home-made.     Milk tea with boba....oh lordy...pretty bad.  So sugary it made me nauseated even though I loves me some sugar.  All I wanted to do was dump half of it out and fill it back up with milk or water to dilute it---it was that bad.  And I dunno what's up with their straws but I wasn't able to pull up any boba with it unless I aimed it at the boba and stabbed it.  I would not order this again.    I do appreciate having this type of food outside of the spring mountain area.  It's a one and done for me."}
{"text":"Great new establishment. We tried the shoyu ramen and the chicken teriyaki with a free milk tea thanks to their grand opening special, and I'm happy to say it was all delicious.  The ramen shined with an amazing depth of flavor and the teriyaki was lightly coated with a rich sauce for tons of flavor that didn't overwhelm your palette.   The staff was friendly and brought the food out to us.  Most importantly, it was very clean and it was a genuinely satisfying experience overall. Definitely coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"I loved it! Very authentic in taste, I had the teriyaki bowl, and let me tell you; portions are pretty big! Defiantly get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced Ramen! We went in and ordered the steamed gyoza, takoyaki and ramen. All for 2. The bill came to $31. Exceptional price and the food was great! The atmosphere is plain, but the food was extremely authentic. We enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this new Japanese restaurant that opened up in the neighborhood. A cold , rainy night gave me the impetus to go and try their Ramen. I was not disappointed. I had the Shoyu Ramen with extra Chashu, extra egg and extra noodles. The noodles, soft boiled eggs and chashu were excellent. The broth was very flavorful, just short of perfect. Also, the broth was just between warm and hot. If they served it piping hot, it would have been much better. They did not have white pepper which should be offered automatically with Ramen. The steamed gyoza and milk tea were also very good. Can't wait to go back and try their udon and curry. So happy to have a Japanese comfort food restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We come here for the ramen every time I'm sick and it's very soothing. We always have leftovers and never end up eating them. I never really have the desire to come here otherwise. The ramen is the only thing I can eat because I'm allergic to soy sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ramen. This is one of the places I will be going regularly. This is my second visit in a year. I have been traveling for business and neglected the locals. I will be stopping by today for another bowl of the awesome ramen."}
{"text":"The Curry Udon is thick, spicy and tasty!  I really like it prepared this way it warms the soul.   Reasonably priced compared to Hawaii and Japan."}
{"text":"A true gentleman.   Close to work, excellent food and the price is right!!!! And it's on the way home from the office for dinner as well.  Also carry ramune as well as calpis drinks.   Takes me back to my days as a home stay student in Japan."}
{"text":"I'm sure their other food is good too but I'm here for the ramen! :) I will def continue to return."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous clean little roman place that has very good prices and lots of flavor and quality for a very inexpensive price! Love this little local gem! I had more than enough amazing dinner for a little over 7 bucks. Can't go wrong with this great little ma and pa place!"}
{"text":"Awesome.... authentic and amazing!  Portions are excellent!  Great service!  Not far from my office which makes it really nice!"}
{"text":"My favorite item here is the cold soba noodle, which can be found on the tiny black chalkboard next to the register.  The dish comes with a generous portion of tempura shrimp and vegetables. Tempura is crunchy, the soba al dente. $7.99, well worth the price.  The only real complaint I have is the A/C is not that strong, so it's a little warm in there.  Seating is adequate, but they have heavy traffic from Nellis and the surrounding businesses."}
