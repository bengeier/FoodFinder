{"text":"I frequent this place since it is on my way home. Sushi takes 10 mins! The sushi is solid and the people there are really nice. It's not my favorite sushi in Charlotte, but it is the best in this area.  Try the Summer Roll. Salmon, avocado, eel sauce... Delish"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch frequently (several times a month) and have found there's a lot to like about Golden Taipei. First of all, the food is consistently good. It's probably not the best Chinese you'll ever eat, but its high quality and well prepared. The preparation is typically very fast- like under 5 minutes from order to table. The service at lunch is also great- my glass is never less than half full and the servers are friendly.  My favorites here are the Sa-Cha scallops and the Bento boxes. If you order a chicken dish, you can also ask for all white meat for an additional 50 cents. Overall the prices are very reasonable.  And there's usually a lunch special with soup/salad and entree for like $5 or so.  You won't be blown away by this place but you'll have a good meal here.  All in all I believe its good food at a good value."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese place but things have changed, the prices have gone up and you get less for your money. They have changed ingredients and don't expect you to notice. The egg rolls that they put n their luch special is not the same egg roll that they have for dinner....they are cheaper and taste horrible."}
{"text":"This place & food is OK. I've been here for lunch & you get more for a cheaper price. Nothing to brag on just like any Chinese Restaurant & I think the dinner portion is not worth the OVER PRICE they charge."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. The food is consistently good (I've tried everything on the menu) and the waitstaff is fabulous. Your glass will never get completely empty, and they are talkative and cheerful. The lunch specials Monday-Saturday are a deal, with generous proportions. The dinner meals are even larger for not that much more. The wait time for the food is very short. I've never had to wait more than 5-7 minutes for my meal to arrive.   The sushi is always fresh.   I don't get why people bash on the decor; it is tasteful and nice looking for a little restaurant that is beside a grocery store.  Give this place a try, you will not be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The food as you can see looks like it came from a can and tasted equally bad. No flavor even though I requested spicy. The fried rice was honestly the worst I have ever tasted. The egg roll looked and tasted like it came from a fast food place at a mall. My server had no personality at all. She didn't ask how I liked my food or comment anything when she came to take my plate full of food. I think Tiffany wanted to get back and eat her lunch at the bar. Terrible food and experience. If your on a budget I get it but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it came on time, and the food was great for the most part.  Not too greasy like most Chinese food, but avoid the sushi rolls.  The tuna roll was one of the most disgusting sushi rolls we've ever tasted.  Stick to the standard Chinese fare, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant after reading all the good reviews & it definitely turned out to be a very disappointing choice. The food tasted very horrible & burnt. We ordered hibachi chicken, sushi rolls (Boston, Ninja), hot & sour soup. Overall, every dish was badly cooked & poor in taste."}
{"text":"Great place! Super friendly wait staff. You can make any dish with white meat (for a small up-charge) if you want. Also, half-price  sushi on Monday and Tuesdays. Great sushi and a great deal!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, not outstanding. Good Cheap Chinese"}
{"text":"Blah. Everything we got was very bland. One pro is that portion size was huge. But a little salt and pepper goes a long way."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant frequently, as it is the closest Asian restaurant to my residence. Aside from the convenient location, I enjoy this place because of its good food. Their Chinese dishes are tasty and their sushi is fresh. This is not the place to go for a gourmet meal, but it is a step above your average Asian carryout.   The restaurant is clean and well kept. Staff are friendly and inviting. This place is consistent in their service and taste. Highly recommended for dining in or carryout."}
{"text":"The sushi is tasty there.  The rest of the menu is fairly average.  I've never dined in there but the people at the front register who accept the takeout orders rarely smile and are on the grumpy side."}
{"text":"I have gone to the same Chinese place since I was a small child so I was looking for something a little different just to try. My boyfriend and I had a coupon so we decided to give Golden Taipei a try. The decor in the restaurant definitely turned me off as well as the lack of traffic in and out. There were only two or three other groups of people eating at lunch time on a Saturday if that tells you anything. We ordered our food, I got sesame chicken. I could have gotten the same stuff at any food court in any mall. Overall, I was not impressed. I didn't feel like it was anything special."}
{"text":"This is a very good Chinese restaurant in a small strip mall on West W.T. Harris. The food here is very good, with almost all of the items fresh made, not frozen or canned.  When you sit down you're greeted with a bowl of fried noodles and duck sauce which is very nice to munch on while you wait.  The won ton soup is excellent with fresh made won tons, and an excellent broth. The crab rangoon are fresh prepared as well.  The sushi here is outstanding. We have never gotten a bad piece, and the presentation is suitably authentic and ornate. They will gladly honor special requests. There is a selection of rolls and pieces available for half price on Mondays and Tuesdays.   Service is quick and attentive. The waitstaff is knowledgeable, and makes helpful suggestions. Portions are large.   The spicy dishes are relatively tame, but they will adjust the heat according to your liking.   Overall, and excellent establishment, and very good for a date night movie combo at the nearby Northlake Mall theater."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here often.  It is a great little date night place to go that is close to home for us. The people recognize us when we come in and greet us with smiles. The food is great as are the quantities given,  we usually end up taking some home.  They also have the 22 oz sapporo cans for a decent price.  Try the steamed dumplings and the curry chicken dish with noodles.  For some it might be a little bit pricey but I think it is worth it."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant for its convenience, friendly service and great decor.  It is a step above the typical mediocre Chinese food available in Charlotte, and their sushi is fresh and delicious.  It is a very clean and pleasant place to eat.  Prices start at about $7.50 per entree.  In nice weather, there is an outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"I went to lunch at Golden Taipei since I got a new job in the area recently.  I had the combo plate of the Teriyaki Chicken and California Roll.  It was good food.  The presentation was kind of neat in the plate they serve it in.  The only reason the rating is not higher is the service.  It was a bit lagging.  I had to wait a bit to get my order taken - longer than what I consider normal over the lunch hour.  Unlike Sakura, which is not too far from here, I will be back to this location again if I am in the area.  It is worth trying yourself and seeing what you think."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Having the option for Chinese and sushi on the same menu saves me so much hassle when I have guests who don't do sushi when I'm craving it. Their lo mein dishes somehow magically double in size when you open the container and their crab rangoon is the best I've had. Other favorites are the hot and sour soup and they have a really great ginger dressing for their salads which is hard to find. The star for me is the sashimi, though. Thick cuts of incredibly fresh fish cut with expertise is reason enough to keep coming back, especially given their lunch specials. The staff is fantastic and always remembers me. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Have been dining here for years and I won't be back ever. Terrible service and they tried to hustle me out an hour before close. Value your customers a little bit more or you'll be out of business very soon."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order from this place and my order came to over $35.  They delivered it on time which was a good thing however, no fortune cookie or sauce came with my meal. No egg roll for my dinner item that I ordered and my Crab Ragoon was a little too crispy from what I am used to. The food was okay, the chicken and broccoli was yummy!"}
{"text":"My mom works near Golden Taipei, so we come here often for lunch (which is usually my dinner time). We always start off with the Hot and Sour soup and the Wonton Eggdrop soup, both very delicious because it comes with a bowl of fried wontons! They also offer sushi specials when you dine in. Their fried Chicken Wings and a side of Fried Rice is a wonderful combination when I'm looking for comfort food. My mom is a huge fan of their Eggplant in Garlic Sauce. It's typically not busy when I dine in, so it's quiet (then again it is 5:30 when I get there). They also offer take out and delivery!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Close to home as I live in Davis Lake, Fast, and friendly staff that really cares about my experience.  Dine in or carry out, either is good.  A Chinese restaurant that has a sushi bar is nice also."}
{"text":"This workers are rude they have charged me more than I was suppose to be charged I paid over 23 dollars for chicken broccoli and rice it wasn't even  enough to feed two  people!!! They  get upset when you don't spend a certain amount of money in there. Every time I get a to go order it's missing and entree. Overpriced rude and the food isn't very good. Make sure to check to go orders they will rip u off."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever received in nearly 16 years. I placed my order at 7:24 and received it at 7:54.  When I inquired about the status of my order, I received a giggle and \"Oh,the big party in the back ordered real, authentic Chinese food so it took us longer.\"  What the hell did I just order then??????"}
{"text":"I've been nice in the past and given this place 3 stars, knowing that I might eat there again.  I don't have that problem anymore.  This place is disgusting.  Much better sushi at the Harris Teeter next door, and I'm not even sure if the chicken in the \"habachi\" was actually chicken.  I've been to half priced sushi on Monday's and Tuesday's that were pretty bad, but I just blamed it on old sushi.  For me to come in on a Saturday lunch and get pale (not torro) looking tuna is just not acceptable.  With the sushi lunch, you get 5 pieces of sushi and tuna rolls.  The tuna in both was barely edible.  3 of the 5 pieces of fish were fishy mackerel or yellowtail.  Just stuff they were trying to get rid of.  The one piece of salmon I got wasn't half bad.  My date ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch.  This wasn't chicken.  It was weird, pale, and kind of gelatinous.  The teriyaki sauce was mostly high fructose corn syrup.  Even my dog looked at me kind of funny when we tried to feed it to her.  Yes, thats where the food went.  Even the little fried pieces of wonton with duck sauce were stale.  These guys need to figure out if they are a Chinese place, a sushi place, or a Japanese place and just do one thing right.  I'm kind of surprised with the rating and that they are even still in business."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in my order I picked up for dinner. This meal was for 2 adults. I ordered Vegetable Lo-mein that $7.95 served in a shallow black plastic dish which I requested no mushrooms but the restaurant felt I didn't want any veggies. So hardly none were added. Had a total of 5 broccoli florets, 4 snow peas and a few stalks of miniature corn. (Over priced $1 to much for what I got). Chicken wings (6) for $4.95. Not the entire wing which includes flats & drums...they were tinniest wingettes that were overly fried. Either make it an entire wing or reduce price. The Crab Rangoon tasted okay. A bit salty as if Cod fish was used. I bet there wasnt any crab meat used. Still tasty w/6 included. But..the vegetable fried rice served in a traditional pint container was decent. For $23...wasn't worth it. Friendly ppl, picked up order (otherwise they charge $3 w/in 3miles to deliver...that's cool. But order must be at least $25..WOW. A bit much for delivery and small quantities of food prepared. 1st time ordering and my last time as well. Out of 5- I'll give them a 1 b/c I ate the food which wasn't that that bad."}
{"text":"Excellent, truly excellent food.  The chicken and broccoli is made with diced chicken thigh meat and the MaPo tofu is made with shredded pork.  No short cuts/pre-made frozen meats. Simple things like pork fried rice and wonton soup are outstanding.  And you can order anything SUPER SPICY HOT.   Sushi is great too, but I go for the dishes that remind me of Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite Chinese place in CLT for years. Great fresh food,  sushi, even a bar. Reasonable lunch specials.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. I used to live around the corner and my friend and I liked to frequent this place often. When I was back in town on business, I definitely added it to my list of places to re-visit and it did not disappoint. I was completely exhausted after a busy day and I hadn't eaten all day either. Thankfully they had drink specials and if I recall correctly my Michelob Ulta was only $2 (maybe $3) and it was served in a chilled beer mug. Perfect! It was just what I needed. My food came out quickly... it was tasty and plentiful. I probably shouldn't have cleared my plate but hey, I did, and I enjoyed it. I even topped it off with another beer. I can't remember how much my bill was but it was inexpensive, which is why I used to love coming to this place so much. Oh and it's never packed. There were only about 4 tables seated while I was there and I remember always being able to be seated immediately and takeout was ready in minutes."}
{"text":"It's a really good place for a quick lunch with good price. It's close to my work. I come her almost whenever I don't have a lunch bag. So much better than any fast food in the area. You actually get to have a real meal. for lunch. They are a little heavy on sauce. But simply tell them so, they will fix it."}
{"text":"I order takeout twice from this place. The service was good but the sushi that i order tasted like the ones you buy in the supermarket, not the best quality, not good. I also order a chicken broccoli in another occasion, not bad but not the best i ever had."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Food, staff, restaurant and the customer service are absolutely on point!! They have always treated my family and I as if we were apart of their's. .. so yes, we have ordered from them on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is with me and chinese food.........we have a an on again off again relationship.  I can go years without eating it and then I'll have a taste for it and it will make me very ill.  I am very leery of the meat being served in these places so I tend to stick to the shrimp fried rice or veggie rice.  I suppose it could be me but I doubt I'll be returning.....I suppose the sushi may be good but I'm afraid to try  it."}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte about 2 years ago, this was my usual Chinese place. The food used to be so good, hot, and everything you could want from a Chinese place. A few months ago, my BF and I went, were prepared to be seated and noticed the sanitation score was a 85, which is a B. Not acceptable. As of March, the score was still only a 90. Knowing that they handle raw fish, makes me seriously question the previous times we have been customers. After looking today that their violations include improper hand washing along with many, many other things, I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place surprised us! Not much to the eye but sever was nice, a little scatter brained but very sweet. The food was hot. They serve hot sake(amd they mean hot)! Portion sizes were hugh, I'll be eating this for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on this side of town. Easy take out with their online ordering ap, Beyond Menu. Dinner portions are big. Perfect for sharing with someone. Food is delicious. Nice size restaurant never seems busy so we always order takeout. Recommended."}
{"text":"First positive I should mention is that they were able to work off the menu! They did not offer fried tofu on the menu and were still able to serve me Sesame Tofu. The dining room and bar were totally empty at 3pm on a Saturday aside from a table of high school kids. After my experience, I have no idea why. The food was seriously delicious, the prices were more than fair, and our waitress was great.  Weird note: the decor is neat and what you would expect of an independent chinese restaurant striving for a cool look. But they had a case of cell phone cases for sale behind the register Hahahaha what the heck?"}
{"text":"After trying a few Chinese cuisine, I find myself coming to this establishment for my Tso fixin'... Wish they deliver though, that's my only gripe...  Food - check... Price - check... Convenience - room for improvement..."}
{"text":"I can appreciate the cheap Sunday buffet.  Wait staff was awesome and kept telling me \"not to rush, take my time\" when I thanked them for filling my water... I didn't have the heart to tell them that I wasn't rushing at all."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had in North Carolina.    I used to work about a mile from them and literally have eaten here 35+ times.  My job has moved back to uptown and i still don't mind driving 20 minutes one way to eat at this place.  This place is so good, I filled out this information and added their business onto yelp!  The inside is very nice and high end looking for a family run Chinese restaurant. I have no problem bringing a nice dinner date here.  Its also very clean and doesn't have that oily smell many do.  Be sure to check out their Sunday lunch buffet to gorge self for $7 or try their hot pepper chicken, eggplant with chicken(its a special from time to time - its not on the menu but they'll make it for you), or just about anything.  I'm moving to san francisco in a couple months where there are over 750 chinese restaurants according to google and i'm worried I won't find one as good as this place!  Make the trip to north charlotte. I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese food we have found in the University area. It's pretty inexpensive, everything is always good, the service is fast and it's in a convenient location. They have half price sushi some days and a pretty cheap Sunday buffet.   Their online ordering system is awesome. You can customize your meals and pay in the store when you pick it up. It is ready in no time."}
{"text":"Loved the orange chicken. Yummy flavor and nice garnishes. Awesome Monday and Tuesday half price sushi special."}
{"text":"Started working close by and some of my co-workers had ordered delivery from here, but had never been to the restaurant.  They raved about the food so I decided to stop in one day for lunch.  Was quickly seated and received my drink very quickly.  However, as I was waiting on my entrée, I noticed movement on the floor.  I quickly realized two roaches were crawling toward me from the kitchen area.  In fact, one was very close to my table.  By the time I got my waiter's attention I had squished one roach to keep it from crawling under my table.  My appetite was gone and I told him I would not be needing my entrée and would not be paying for the two sips of tea I had.  He said I would have to speak with the manager before he'd allow me to leave without paying.  I told him he could tell the manager I'd leave quietly or I'd make sure everyone saw the dead roach by my table.  I will NEVER go back and I've told all my co-workers that the place they're ordering from has roaches.  Roaches crawling across a dining room floor are a sign of more roaches in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Just an amazing value. Split a lunch with my sis and let me tell you... we can EAT. A mid-day portion was plenty. And the service was impeccable. 10/10. Great price, great food, fabu location and super chilled out atmosphere. Get the Chicken Kon Bo. SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I experienced a flurry of sugar and cartilage in terms of the food, though the wait staff was great."}
{"text":"Very typical Chinese food. Although the decore and tableside presentation were nice I felt the food was nothing to write home about. I have eaten here several times hoping to find a dish that was really good, but to no avail. It's not bad by any means, just nothing memorable or craveable."}
{"text":"It's okay, the veggies are good and egg rolls. The cuts of chicken are good but the sauce is horrible. Tastes like out of a can from who knows where. If the sauce is improved it would be wonderful."}
{"text":"I like their spring roll,It tasted so good every time I order from golden Taipei,I order the sushi & Chinese food always fresh,The portion,quality and price are great,you can not find somewhere place to beat,I definitely recommend to someone that I know."}
{"text":"Finally some good Chinese food in the north Charlotte area! I used to work near a Chinese restaurant whose fried rice was my very favorite and the frequency of which I would order it proved that very fact. I now have a viable option with Golden Taipei.  It's located in the Davis Lake shopping center that houses the Starbucks and Harris Teeter. It's very small on space and offers a few booths, center table seating, and a couple outdoor tables. They have the typical Chinese restaurant lunch special offerings that come with your choice of egg roll or spring roll and pork fried rice. There's also sushi and hibachi lunch specials, however, I haven't tried those yet.  I can highly recommend the shrimp and broccoli. Unlike other places that rely on bulky pieces of shrimp (to mislead you into thinking you're getting more shrimp), Golden Taipei's take consists of small pieces of shrimp and they are generous!   If pork fried rice is not your thing with the lunch special, they will switch it up based on your preference. Food is ready promptly, so you can either call ahead or dine in during your lunch."}
{"text":"I craved some good Chinese fried rice not the soy stained rice or yellow fake fried rice. Yuck! This place was Prefect order for shrimp fried rice! The lady at the counter was attentive & nice & my order came out quick in a to go box. It smelled great & tasted super. I enjoyed it & ate it for 2 days. They packed a bunch for $7. So worth it. I'll b back for more & other items to taste"}
{"text":"Some of the best Asian food I've ever eaten in the Queen City. Would recommend if you like this kind of ccuisine."}
{"text":"Service was out of this world. And can I just say, the oversized sushi rolls are SO delicious and Big you need to unhinge your jaw to get it all in!!!  #1stworldproblems"}
{"text":"Broccoli beef... the sauce was more like a gravy and the service was not very attentive."}
{"text":"Food has been very good lately. And to make it even better, they have beer and wine back on the menu"}
{"text":"Sunday buffett is incredible.  Sushi is great and very inexpensive.  Traditional dishes hit the spot."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time.  Service was fast and food was delicious. . Deffinatly coming back"}
{"text":"Great little place for a date meal on a budget or a quick tasty lunch.  I have been here three times now and they continue to impress me each and Every time. I came twice for lunch and got two separate lunch combos and must say they are your typical Chinese chicken dishes, but they do not smoother the chicken in a soup of sauces.  KILLER DATE IDEA!!!! Monday and Tuesday half price sushi rolls and none of them are over 3.50. Did this one night and gf and I got out with out meal two soups, four rolls and an egg roll for 15-16 bucks plus tip. Awesome cheap deal for a lazy Monday or Tuesday when work or school had you beat down.   Will also allow you to have large parties in the back room as well."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food here. It's not spectacular but definitely a step above most \"Chinese\" spots and half off maki rolls (I know, not Chinese) on Mondays and Tuesdays for dine in customers is a big plus too. It's not stellar sushi but again, pretty decent, and for the price, it hits the spot well enough. The servers and hostesses are always pleasant and I think their prices in general are quite reasonable. If I could, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. Good enough that I go back even if not exceptional."}
{"text":"I enjoy going this restaurant on a regular basis. I've only ever eaten off their sushi menu so that's what I'm reviewing. The fish is always fresh and tasty. The waitstaff are very personable and attentive. I always sit at the sushi bar and frequently treated to grattis items. Their sushi menu isn't as extensive as some but they'll make anything you ask. One of the servers knows my taste and has the chef make non menu items she knows I'll like. Give it a try sometime and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This used to be the only restaurant I would go to. HOWEVER, one of my friends and I went there just to find a rude cashier. Rudeness I can handle, but unwarranted disrespect from a stranger I will not stand for.  She asked what did he do. He replied he was a nurse. She the. Responded you don't look like a nurse (while he stood in scrubs). Then she added you don't look like you even have a job.  I WILL NEVER PUT MY MONEY INTO A PLACE WHO HAS BLATANT DISRESPECT FOR THEIR PATRONS."}
{"text":"The sushi is so good !! I went there when it was half off when u dined in and I would highly recommend it. The server could have paid us more attention but she was dealing with a complicated customer that it was okay ."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the day it opened, and it's always been fantastic.  The owner, Tony, has several restaurants in China, and he knows what he's doing.   I know a lot of Chinese people that come here to get their authentic fix. Eat here, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for 3 years. Have never had anything that wasn't fresh and delicious. I travel here for business and it is my go to place."}
{"text":"The place was hot as hell so i ate my dish sweating. The wonton soup was decent. I ordered chicken with garlic sauce. Half of the dish was cold and the other half was hot. Prob wont return."}
{"text":"The sushi yet fresh was not prepared right. The rolls where just to big per piece insted of a 6 piece with huge almost unbite size pieces he should just make it 8 sushi is meant to be eaten in 1 bite. The tuna was good i just have had better nothing stood out at all. And the people greeting you are doing anything but that not a place id go out of my way to eat"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food my love and I usually order to go here when are eating a late dinner. My typical order is the veggie fried rice with spring rolls while his is the vegtable lo mein with spring rolls."}
{"text":"Got some Chinese food and sushi with some of my friends it is so good I will definitely comeback for more the staff is really friendly and nice i have to show my family and friends to this place"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. The food is delicious and the staff is so sweet. I drive from South Charlotte to come to this restaurant. This place is always clean and they give you a ton of food for a very great price."}
{"text":"I've only been for takeout... the sushi is okay, but the lo mein is very vinegary which is why I stopped coming here for it."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food and even better sushi!   We decided to try their 1/2 off Sushi on Mon & Tues, and we have been coming here at least once a week ever since.  The Sushi was surprisingly fresh.  Edamame is great as well. And I get the steamed shrimp with vegetables and brown rice to go...AMAZING!  And lastly you can't go wrong with their shrimp or vegetable egg roll, DELISH!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great blend of Chinese and Japanese food. Love their General Tso's Chicken, best around!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night. Definitely tasted like chinese food, however it was a bit overpriced compared to other places in the area. If Kung Pao Express was open on Sundays I 100% would have gone there."}
{"text":"This is the only descent sushi place in the Concord area that I've tried, and I've tried almost all of them! Fish is fresh and there is some variety to the rolls. I always get the Harris Sashimi, Wasabi roll and Phoenix roll. The service is friendly and fast. I always do takeout but the atmosphere is nice and cozy there. It is a bit pricey, but I keep going back because it is the only place with fresh fish around."}
{"text":"I had a taste for some sushi and the hubbs and I decided to give this place another whirl!  This time; however, we went the take-out route and I was not disappointed!! Our food was steaming hot, fresh, and tasty!  The sushi was, once again, right on point and we got extra fortune cookies!! Win!  I can honestly say this is my new favorite Chinese food restaurant! It's super convenient, the staff is very friendly, and it's economical (especially when hubby decides he wants shrimp AND beef in his fried rice).  Check it out if you're passing by (better yet, invite me along)!"}
{"text":"Came in at 3:30 today for the sushi special as I usually do every week.  We came purposefully at a time that was not busy because we have a 2 year old son.  When we got there it took 10 minutes to place an order and our son was getting impatient.  In the mean time while waiting on our food to arrive someone who works there told us that we needed to control our son( who was sitting in a high chair the whole time) because they had a customer.  I looked around and there was a total of 1 person in the entire restaurant. Only one.  If you have children don't bring them here!!! They don't want you as customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Chinese menu, uh, not authentic enough, at least for Sichuan dish. Just wrong..."}
{"text":"So good. So quaint. Perfect customer service.   I came here after church on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all. The selection consists of the typical egg-drop soup and the small variety of rolls with a unique sweet potato roll, along with the typical entrees of cheese rangoons to the lo mein.  I usually hate how busy a buffet is so the \"lowkeyness\" of this place makes me feel a lot better in terms of the feeling of a normal paced atmosphere where everything isn't rushed.   If you're looking for something with more variety, go to a full sized buffet, but if you're looking for something more discreet, lowkey, reasonably-priced, and also good in taste, this is a great place to go to if you're within the proximity of this location."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Went for the Chinese dishes rather than my usual sushi. Had a seafood entrée with lobster, scallops, and shrimp along with the usual Chinese style veggies in a brown sauce.  It was really great. And plenty of it too. The veggies were very fresh and cooked just right which to me is very key for Chinese food. Loved it."}
{"text":"I try not to eat so much Chinese food anymore, but when I do, this is the restaurant that I come to. The quality of the food and ingredients are much better than other Chinese \"carry out\" restaurant in this area. I mostly come here for the sushi but I've had the sesame chicken and general tso chicken and there are no complaints. The best part is that they have a mini buffet on Sundays from 11 am to I believe 2-3pm. I haven't tried the buffet part just yet, but I'm pretty sure it is good and it's only 8.99 a person. The only downside of this restaurant is on my lunch breaks. It seems like they are short staffed but other than that everything else is great!"}
{"text":"I love ordering from here. It is definitely one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in the Charlotte area. They have a wide variety of Asian food, and all if it is fresh and tasty.   The prices are good and the people there are always friendly. Definitely a staple for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Golden Taipei has good food and decent service. I have been dining here for almost 5 years, and their food is consistently good. I tend to visit during lunch and their specials are nicely priced. Their sushi is good, but not the best. I love the general tso's chicken and orange chicken. Though, I always ask for white meat... Sometimes their dark meat dishes seem over cooked. My husband loves their Mai fun - it's a good choice if you like noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and delicious when I came to do a to go order for lunch. The place was very busy with other professional types and the staff definitely caters to that. They realize you only have a certain amount of time and get your food to you quickly.   My order only took about 10-15 minutes and the to go waitress apologized (no need, but I appreciate great customer service) and gave me a free sweet tea to go. I got a shrimp tempura roll, Alaskan roll, and crab rangoon. The sushi came with wonton soup and wontons. It was a ton of food for less than $14 and I was able to save some for dinner (score!). This place is less than a mile from my office so I'll certainly be back on days when I \"forget\" my lunch. Next time I'll have to sit in and try their buffet.   They also have a 1/2 off sushi deal on Monday and Tuesday but it is eat in only."}
{"text":"Location: Shopping center with plenty of parking Day: Sunday @3pm Take out Not crowded Atmosphere: booths, tables, bar and TVs  Ordered egg roll, shrimp lo mein and chicken wings I had to wait @10 minutes.  They were cleaning up from the Sunday buffet that they offer.  The food was very hot and fresh.  The BEST lo mein I have tasted in awhile ( it actually had veggies in it as well.  Chicken and egg roll fried well. Hard to find a good and reasonable Chinese location for take out in the area. I will return."}
