{"text":"We went there on a week night around 530 pm. We were seated right away and brought drinks fairly quick. Put the order in and the beef in red sauce I had was good. The wife had chile relleno with a pablano pepper. She said it was one of the best she has had. Now the service needs to improve greatly. We never got another glass of water and it took a long time for the bill to come. They are competing with Rio Mirage right next door so they need to shape up quickly. They are a little pricey for mexican but I don't mind if it's good. They need to work out the problems if they're going to succeed."}
{"text":"We had 12 people for a birthday dinner,and we all had a wonderful experience. We ate meals that ranged from pasta Alfredo to shrimp fajitas to carne asada to ribeye steak tacos to chicken mole to some type of squid and octopus meal to chicken fajitas,and everyone commented how fresh and home cooked all of the meals tasted. Our waiter Edson, with his quick wit added to our enjoyable evening. We defiantly will make this a future culinary destination for large gatherings or indidual meals. Don't let the area where the restaurant is located deter you. The inside was very well maintained,and above all the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Yelp, you did it again. You led me to a restaurant that surpassed expectations.  This place is adorable. It's decked out in a pirate theme that any adventurer would love. When we pulled into the parking lot, we saw employees putting together an outdoor grill area that looked extremely promising.   We entered the restaurant and were pleasantly greeted by the friendliest face, Edsen ! We ordered a shrimp cocktail and bacon wrapped shrimp to share. In the end, this place has extremely fresh ingredients, served by a lovely and invested staff, and it is delicious. The guacamole and salsas are crisp and flavorful. The shrimp is well prepared. Pirates Cove is a hidden treasure all its own."}
{"text":"Guys and gals. I had them make a Margarita that was not on the menu. He nailed it you must try the sopas de 7 mares . edson was our waiter and I recommend highly having him as your waiter."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.. If you ever go down to Rocky Point MX. the food is the same as if you were at La Curva or eating at Senor Amigos.. Great whole fried fish, Chile Relenno, and the Carnitas Michelle were worth the trip. Cold beer and the atmosphere that makes you long to go south of the border. The only thing missing is the Beach."}
{"text":"Nice interior, friendly attentive staff but the food we did not like. Sorry but won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is never open! Their sign says 10am to 8pm for Tuesday. This is the third time we have driven here and found out they were closed.  I have eaten here once and asked about being closed all the time. They said they had changed managers and would be open.  Really a shame as they have really good food. I won't be back, unless I call first."}
{"text":"The place is kind of rough looking from the outside and unless going on other YELP reviews would probably not have gone in..but that being said the food was excellent. I had the Chile verde enchiladas and my wife had the Camarones ala Diablo. Both were freshly made and very good ... service was good , granted we were the only customers on this Sunday afternoon. They were a little stingy on the chips, but filled them when asked.. the salsa was also very good.. will definitely go again.."}
{"text":"Second time coming here was mother day with the hubby...it was soooooo Good!! I got the Pozole...AMAZING!! Queso Fundido, Enchiladas Suizas Tacos de Carne asada!! Sooooo gooood!! An amazing little hidden Gem in El Mirage!! I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE POZOLE!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. We all enjoyed our experience here and we'll be back. The atmosphere is cool and entertaining for kids."}
{"text":"What a hidden treat!  Yup, it's tucked away in a beat up strip mall along side Food City. Located a half a block west of our old favorite Rio Mirage Cafe., Pirate Cove was the answer when we were looking for something a little different and less cookie-cutter. Have no fear. The Pirate Cove is not a dive. It is clean. The staff of this family-owned restaurant is attentive and work hard to make satisfied customers. And the food is very good.  The menu is authentic and features Mexican seafood/mariscos.  Traditional saucy seafood cocktails in the Mexican beachside tradition. There is also a full slate of Mexican offerings. Cute little patio. Full bar. We enjoyed the experience very much and will add The Pirate Cove to our list of local favorites."}
{"text":"First visit to Pirate's Cove last night. Great experience. Edson and Jessica did a great job of making us feel at home and provided great service. We sat in the back area an watched the guys doing food preparation. We enjoyed the guacamole, queso, chicken mole, and margaritas. The chicken mole was fantastic! The place was very clean and sanitary. We will definitely go back. Don't give up on trying to find Pirate's Cove because it is tucked away in a strip mall."}
{"text":"My friends and I met here for happy hour and Edson, the owner, personally came out and introduced himself. He took us under his wing and while service was a little slow (he seemed to be a one-man show the night we were there) he more than made up for it with his friendliness. The decor is all pirate which seems misplaced for a Mexican bar byt it was fun and kitschy.  The drinks were good(and he makes them based on what you tell him) and the appetizers (we got the sampler) just right. He even took off a few of our drinks on our final tab! We will be returning because friendly and hospitable places are a rarity these days! Really great and unexpected little hole in the wall gem!"}
{"text":"A little treasure in El Mirage. Service and food were fantastic. The rustic Pirate theme adds a fun element to this family restaurant. Seafood is fresh and the Mexican dishes are expertly created from a young chef direct from Mexico. My new treasure."}
{"text":"Went Friday night and the place was just about empty. Strange because it's actually pretty good. Its good solid food and they seem to know what they are doing. The chips and salsa are fresh and made in house. Where else do you find that? Go eat here!"}
{"text":"I had three tacos, one tripas and two cabeza. Unfortunately there was very little meat and no flavor. On the other hand my wife had Mojarra (deep fried tilapia) with garlic. This fish dish was fantastic! I guess we will stick with seafood.  The tacos were $3.00 a piece (way too much) and the mojarra was around $14.00. This place is a little pricey."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, can't be seen from the street.  I ordered a Michelada, which was made perfectly!  For food, we ordered the pollo poblano, which was good. Not a lot of spice, but flavorful. Husband ordered the seafood poblano, which he raved about. Dad ordered the Carnitas. He said they were good, and he is a man of little words. Son had the shrimp cocktail and he enjoyed it.  All the food was good, but could have used more spice. Maybe we could have asked for more. We will be back and try again.  The service was great, very friendly and helpful.  This reminds me of a little mom and pop shop I used to go to as I was younger. Where my Dad was a regular and would ask the owner what's good and she would whip something up for him, not on the menu, just because she knew his tastes. I would love to have a place like that to frequent."}
{"text":"Finally a non-chain non-commercialized authentic Mexican food place.  I heard about the Pirate Cove from other reviews on facebook, so decided to give them a try.  My husband and 12 year old son went, loved the theme, and overall vibe.  It took me back to when I went to Mexico as a child.  I ordered the carne asada plate, which was way too much food for one person.  I literally only ate 1/3 of it.  The carna asada was really good but the beans are some of the best I've had in a while.  Our waitress was very helpful and friendly, and the guy behind the bar was also very friendly.  Overall great experience and will be back.  I don't feel they were overly pricey but priced just right."}
{"text":"This food is amazing! We have searched far and wide for fresh seafood in the Phoenix / arrowhead area and this is it! EVERYTHING IS SO FRESH AND TASTEFUL! It was a blessing to find this place ! The manager Etson is also so friendly and rad! If you are looking for amazing food and booze please stop by, you defiantly will not be disappointed ! :)"}
{"text":"A decent Mexican place in the West Valley. Its menu stays pretty close to the classics, such as enchiladas,  chiles rellenos, fajitas, and the like. It's pirate theme also means seafood, with cocktails, fish tacos,  and shrimp in a variety of preparations. It's definitely  NOT a \"cheese palace\" of the type that is popular around here, with every dish slathered in a half pound of melted cheese and sour cream. I had Michoac√°n style carnitas, which came on a heap of grilled onions and with  a roasted poblano pepper. Good crisp carnitas. My wife had shrimp in garlic sauce, which she said was delicious. We each had a margarita on the rocks; not exceptional but definitely drinkable. We also ordered iced tea, which they had run out of, so the waitress brought us ice water infused with fresh mint and lime. Refreshing.   Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Prices are in line with other full-service Mexican  places. It's clean and comfortable. Find it tucked into a strip mall with other Hispanic-oriented businesses, and a Food City close by. Nice to have a place like this in our neck of the woods."}
{"text":"\"Best tip I can give you is that when going to Nino's, you drive 4 kilometers past it, and you'll find this great little restaurant called The Pirate Cove and get you some real food.\"  --Grisamentum.   Still a great example of how food should be done.   Just to give you yelpers an idea, we were talking kitchen with the cooks and the staff and how much we love certain dishes & flavors and they made us a dish that wasn't even on the menu just because we said we liked it.    Fucking bad ass or what?  That's customer service, like, Going out-of-your-way kinda customer Service.  Great group of guys in here.   I'm only throwing shade on you cos you're not open on mondays. And it's Monday.   See how that creates a problem for me?   I had to eat at Nino's. Which is basically like I threw $16.35 out the window.   So... You owe me $16.35. Ya'know, Whenever you get a chance.   Thanx."}
{"text":"Have tried many of their seafood dishes and I have not been disappointed.  Might be a bit pricey but its definitely worth the price and it's a convenient location for me."}
{"text":"The carnitas were very good! Also, had rice and beans which were great compliments! It was very slow but service was good."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Staff was attentive and fun. Food was fresh and all dishes were cooked to order and nothing was pulled out of a try that was cooked last night.  We will definitely be back again.  Chile relleno was great fresh poblano pepper with octopus and shrimp breaded nicely and with a really rich sauce. Try this place out. Authentic and fresh"}
{"text":"Menudo is absolutely delicios ,Posole is delicios, can't wait to go back!!!!The music is great, everything is  custom made to order, not yor average chain."}
{"text":"Good food and service.. We will be back.  Everything we ordered was delicious..The decorations are pretty fun as well!"}
{"text":"It's a 2 star at best, it's in a run down area of El Mirage next to food city, you would think that a place with the name pirate cove would be a l sea food place but truth is they have very little in the way of sea food, it's a Mexican restaurant.  It also caters to a certain demograph of people due to it's location...We felt like we were in a bar rather than a restaurant due to the fact there was a table full of guys just hanging out drinking beer.  Oh and this place only displays the Mexican flag...I guess they like Mexico better than where they live now. U.S.A. Hum imagine that."}
{"text":"Loved the food at Pirates Cove! Really nice and fun decor. Service was great and everyone was super friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled across this place! There really isn't any good, non-chain, Mexican restaurants in El Mirage/Surprise. Definitely a hidden gem and a must try!   I had the carne asada plate with spicy red sauce on the side and it was amazing! Looking forward to trying nearly the whole menu!!!  12/12/2017 - Amazed once again! Seriously the best Mexican restaurant on the West side. Had the Roja beef today and contemplating coming back tomorrow for the same thing haha!   Great staff as well. You need this in your belly now..."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but felt like I, must warn others about my experience. The inside was very nice and clean, especially in an older strip mall. Service was terrible, we had to ask for utensils after our appetizer was delivered, and then given spoons. We order the queso fondido was just cheese in a cast iron skillet and stuck to the bottom of skillet. My wife had bacon covered shrimp, cooked on the outside raw in the middle, I had fish it was undercooked and raw. I wanted to leave after have to ask for both plates to be sent back. The rice and beans in the plate I would have served my dog, the rice smelled foul, beans crusty and old. My wife and I read the previous reviews and love seafood being from Chesapeake Bay Area and know seafood. Thinking wow, a Mexican seafood place by the house let's try it, $77 later we wish we would have gone to Filiburto's for shrimp burritos for around $10, would have been the same amount of food and 100% better than this place. Save your money people go to Taco Bell, this place is WAY over priced and not good."}
{"text":"We came here because Edson was so good at adding more flare to the place with his enthusiasm for food and flavor! We came in today looking for Etson and he is no longer working here. Big bummer! The food is good though, shrimp cocktails are great and the chille rellenos are one of the best in the area. Edson...you'll be missed!! We love your enthusiasm and passion!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing go there now. Service is the best, food is incredible! It's not the best location for them, so spread the word!"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Best seafood I found in my area. Great service, Edson took care of us when we went in."}
{"text":"We came here for a Friday dinner.  The service was a tad slow had to ask for refills.  But the food was very good.  I ordered the carne asada plate.  The tortillas was freshly made, you can taste the homemade-ness (If that is a word).  This place is a little hidden behind and next to the food city."}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a gem to have found. The food was delicious I had the carne Asada with flour tortillas and my boyfriend ordered the stuffed chicken pepper. Service was great very attentive. Cozy spot definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything.  Can't wait to go back and try the chicken mole.  Everything made from scratch, salsa was different than any I have ever tried but delicious."}
{"text":"Had green chili cheese enchiladas....they were good.  Restaurant is clean.  Portion sizes are not big but very suitable."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Mexican restaurant but food and service was amazing! Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"I love that this is a new original restaurant. Edson made us feel very welcomed and was amazingly friendly. The food was tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp fajitas and shrimp tacos. Not too bad for being open for only 2 months. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is tucked back in the shopping center and has the most amazing, fresh seafood!  The service and food was wonderful! The Pirate Cove is a hidden treasure!  Well worth seeking out.  Thank you Alana for your great hospitality!"}
{"text":"How many ways can you say AMAZING!!! Incredible fresh food and well worth the wait. Certainly a gem tucked away in a strip mall. We were beyond impressed. Had the ceviche...fish tacos and las suizas enchiladas absolutely OUTSTANDING. Our waiter was Edson exceedingly polite and great a personality. Certainly a 10+++++!!!"}
{"text":"House Marg's are totally mediocre. Chips and salsa were blah. Some of the other food \"looked\" pretty good. But, I was in for Happy Hour and just wanted a margarita ."}
{"text":"First time here and my friend and I were amazed at how good it was! I started off with a Michelada, awesome! She had a Margarita, homemade and delicious! Our bartender/servers name was Anna, and she was amazing! Gave us a sample of the mango Margarita with big chunks of mango in it, yum! She was very patient with us while we asked a million questions and was very informative. We started off with the ceviche, so fresh and wonderful! We also ordered the seafood chili relleno, steak fajitas, and a beef tongue taco. My friend was a little scared to try the taco, but once it hit her mouth, her funny face she previously had, disappeared!  She was like WOW! I can't wait to go back and try more wonderful items. A hidden little GEM for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last week it seems like just a little hole in the wall but the inside seems clean and well-kept. I had the deep-fried fish it was amazing and The best Michelada I've ever had! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this little restaurant that my friend and I decided to give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed. We arrived 10 minutes before they were technically open, but they greeted us and let us sit inside which was great because it was over 110 outside. Service was awesome, our server interacted great with my friends one year old son. I love that we were made to feel at home. Food was awesome. I had enchiladas and a shredded beef taco. The decor was awesome., and my kids will love it I'm sure when I bring them. Will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was good, the wait for the food was a bit long but well worth it. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce and it was very tasty. Place was clean and the people here were very attentive. Oh and the mango mojito was the BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited the 12 minutes till 11 for someone to show up  thinking they had not updated the hours on FB and Yelp. A guy comes up at 11:10 and ignored us. We give him a few minutes and get up to go in to be told they open at noon!  This is actually the 2nd time this has happened, very bummed as I love Mexican and really wanted to try their food. I'm  done, won't try a 3rd time."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, Beer was cold and service was exceptional! Etson took great care of us! I can't wait to bring friends in and introduce them to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Not too crowded, fast service, great food. Really good size portions and prices. Definitely coming back to try more food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant I've had!! I am very picky with my seafood and I can eat this everyday!"}
{"text":"I decided to give pirate cove another try today on national shrimp day. I came a couple weeks ago and had the agua chile, it was so friggin HOT, I had to take a couple of breaks to finish it. This time I ordered the ceviche, I just didn't have the heart to put my toilet through that ugliness again LOL. The owner is a really nice guy, he is very customer oriented and knows that it takes respect to earn and keep customers. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Gave this a try on a Sunday afternoon. Kind of hard to find tucked into a run down shopping center, but it's cute on the outside and cute on the inside. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The mojito was hand crafted and tasty. Chips and salsa also good - salsa had a different spice, which was a nice change.  I ordered steak tacos and my friend got a grilled whitefish (not sure where that fell on the menu) and both were delicious and a great value.   The menu is varied and should have something for everyone. I'm not into fish/seafood, so I was afraid the place would have a fishy smell or only fish on the menu - but there was a lot of options. The guac was excellent as was the rice.  I hope this place makes it. The food is good. The staff friendly and welcoming. The price a good value for what you get.  This isn't the run of the mill Mexican place. If you're in the area, give it a try. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole the wall restaurant. They are still working out some of the kinks is service (kind of slow) but the food is well worth the wait. The mango Margarita is amazing. Our first visit to this place I ordered the daily special of 3 enchaladas one beef with red sauce, one chicken with a cream sauce,1 cheese with green sauce. The chicken one is almost better than my wife's chicken enchaladas. My wife ordered shrimp in a wine sauce. The chef delayed it coming to the table because he noticed it did not have the correct sauce so he had it remade. To make up for the delay they gave her another Margarita (score).  Tonight I decided to have the whole fried fish.  This dish is a whole tilapia marinated in lemon and lime with sea salt. It was little weird eating a whole fish but worth the try. I defiantly suggest you give this small business family run restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight. It was amazing . Went with 7 other people so we waited a little for our food , and the inside is small but the food was worth the wait. I had the diabla shrimp, big shrimp in a spicy red sauce... can't wait to have it. All 8 of us loved our food and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Several of us went for dinner last week for the first time as we had heard rave reviews for this place. Service was very slow. Margaritas were tasty but not worth the price. Two of us ordered carne asada and the other ordered carnitas. Salsas were watery. When the food came, we had to ask for silverware. When she finally brought it, it was only a fork in a napkin. We had to ask for knives for the asada. The asada was very tough and we had to literally saw through it. Re fried beans were runny and very bland. Rice was white with some peas thrown in. No flavor or seasoning in it. I've never had Mexican rice this way. It was like eating minute rice. The tortillas were very small. We asked where they got them and the server told us from a lady who comes by every morning. Sure hope she has her food handlers license. All in all, service was very slow and it wasn't crowded, food was not good, and way overpriced. Needless to say, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always shop at the Food City in the same area.  Saw the new sign and decided to give it a try.  First of all the Michelada's are amazing and refreshing for the summer!  The chef recommended the shrimp taco platter.  I went with the recommendation and got the plate.  Service was great but only Mexican grill I've been to that doesn't give you chips and salsa.  Don't know if they forgot or if its charged.  The taco plate came and it was a very good portion.  I would have preferred the shrimp be grilled buy they were fried with some kind of batter.  But delicious it was!  I'm a big fan of ceviche's so cant wait to try this on my next visit.  Oh, and another Michelada!"}
{"text":"It's a cute place, but the food is very bland. I ordered chicken tacos, and it was basically boiled chicken in a shell. There was no seasoning whatsoever. They serve rice pilaf rather than Mexican rice. The salsa was the only thing that had any flavor."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. Went to this place because most of the reviews were good, but our experience was totally different. They give chips and salsa to start, chips were extremely stale and they do not have red salsa just the green. Carne asada is bland and tough, really close to being beef jerky. Tostada is 1 very small disc of tortilla like what you would expect to get off the kids menu. Steak quesadilla was very bland and mostly just tortilla. And everything came out burnt. House margarita is a joke, can't make you a strawberry daiquiri but you can get a cherry one (never even heard of cherry daiquiris) and if you order a soda enjoy your cup of ice. Complained to the waitress and they took 50% off two of the three meals and total was still $40. Save your money, you're better off going to Taco Bell. Will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"The pirate cove was delicious. I ordered the carnitas fajitas and I was not disappointed. The michelada was also very flavorful. I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Best seafood on the west side. Actually the only seafood/mariscos every menu item we have tried has been excellent! Their fried tilapia is the delicious!!"}
{"text":"Small mom and pop place, great customer service. Food was delicious, the drinks were never empty! Cute atmosphere and fun place to hang out. If you haven't tried it make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Visiting for Spring Training and came across this place from Yelp and the food is amazing! Staff is very friendly too! If we visit for Spring Training definitely stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch Ordered chicken enchiladas suizas  Came with rice and beans $14.00 Rice bland no seasoning  Beans just mashed pintos no flavor seasoning  They were supposed to have chicken in them but I think no one told the cook that maybe a teaspoon total in 3 tortillas  My friend had fish tacos same thing bland no flavor even the sauce on them was bland. The only thing that was pretty good was the guacamole  The waitress didn't bring silverware or napkins had to get myself  She was complaining about not getting a tip from another customer  So food service not good will not be back there"}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. The food is excellent.  Love the atmosphere and that it is family owned.  Very friendly staff, great service."}
{"text":"The manager was nice and attentive.... Food was 6 out of 10. Shrimp cocktail was good but had A LOT of cilantro in it. The enchiladas were also about a 5.  I would try it again but only to eat the tacos... Sorry but gotta be honest...."}
