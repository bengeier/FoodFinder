{"text":"Food was bland. I added 3 packets of soy sauce to my food. The egg roll was spoiled. Felt nauseous immediately after eating it. Would not recommend. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Please avoid this place at all costs, it is cheap for a reason, the food is bland and very greasy like if they fry the food in warm oil. All plates come with rice and an egg roll, the fried rice is just disgusting tasted like dirty water. Orange chicken in sauce that is not sweet at all, I don't understand how the place has been open for so long."}
{"text":"Chinese food has been good here and the price is decent for the amount you get. We started ordering our Chinese delivery from here. Normally order the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Family local market love them, they make you feel like family also sells hot meals. To die for?"}
{"text":"I live in the crummy apts right across & I've been coming here for years. The food doesn't disappoint and is reasonably priced. Place is well kept and they do pickup. The business owners are friendly and courteous. Try it!"}
{"text":"Yes, Phoenix is sadly not known for having the best Chinese food. I've been ordering from some of the places on Postmates and I usually order sweet and sour pork. The sweet and sour pork of my childhood always tasted like pork and had lots of peppers, onions and pineapple. Now sometimes you just get a plate of fried nuggets with sauce on the side.
Today I got the craving and decided to try Ben's brothers. The pork tasted like pork, the sauce wasn't overly sweet and there was lots of peppers, onions and carrots. No pineapple, but I didn't care. This is the best rendition of this dish I've had in a long time. It came with fried rice and an eggroll and you can't beat the price. Wonder what to try next."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed by the food from here. I was craving Chinese food and since I live far from my favorite Chinese food place (New Asian Kitchen), and was too tired to drive there safely, I decided to order from this place. I had the choice of trying this place or trying Autumn Court Chinese (for the first time for both) and I'm pretty sure I made the wrong choice. I ordered the crab puffs, which all I could taste was the green onion, and the orange chicken entree with steamed rice. The chicken was extremely bland and chewy and the rice was ok, just ordinary white rice which is kinda hard to screw up. I think the best part of the meal was the fortune cookie, which was just your run of the mill fortune cookie. I wish I could go back in time to warn myself to not order from here and to try the other place instead. Seriously, don't eat this if you enjoy actually tasting food."}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet and sour chicken ; piping hot and great texture . Came with egg roll and rice for around $7.50, nice little hole in the wall in my neighborhood . I believe I heard they are also on UberEats"}
{"text":"Not that bad.  For the price the quality and quantity are good! The food does need a little more seasonings. Will I order out again?! Sure,  the food wasn't supper bad..the only thing I didn't enjoy was the egg rolls waaay to much cinnamon. 

Shrimp in shrimp fried rice is small but has a good amount of them. 

Egg rolls way to much cinnamon.

Chicken fried rice not much flavor. 

Kung Pao Chicken was good."}
{"text":"I was NOT expecting to like this place so much. I've lived in the valley for 3 years and I've had a hard time finding great Chinese takeout--it's not like Phoenix is known for Chinese food, after all. So when I order delivery from Ben Brothers, I expected generic, prepackaged-quality \"Chinese\" food. But boy, was I ever surprised. We ordered a few different shrimp dishes and the crab puffs, and while didn't see it being made, I'm absolutely positive it was made fresh. The veggies and shrimp had that bright, flavorful snap and burst that can only be brought by fresh ingredients. Even the crab puffs had that chewy-crispy quality that come with wanton wrappers that were just fried. This will definitely be my go-to for Chinese takeout from now on."}
