{"text":"How fortunate to have such a great indian cusine in monroville and owner is quite gracious.Food is outstanding"}
{"text":"Very very bad service. Forgot half of the order. Never attended us once , we have to call them to re-fill the water and even place order. If you are couple , then DON'T GO, they don't attend you,  you have to keep calling them. If there were option for negative rating I might prefer that."}
{"text":"In many small towns mediocre restaurants get high ratings, so my wife and I were skeptical about the 4.5 rating for Mintt. On a trip from Philly to  Cleveland we stopped for lunch.  What a culinary treat the buffet was!  A great variety of flavors both vegetarian and meat, spicy and mild, rich and low calorie, plus soup, salad and dessert.  The food was not at all greasy or swimming in ghee. The staff was prompt,  helpful and charming and? the price was right.  Fast in and out and worth the 2 mile drive off the turnpike.  Mintt has only been open 4 months but is a find for those who like Indian food."}
{"text":"Great new Indian restaurant! There aren't many quality non-vegetarian Indian restaurants around, but now there is. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo with garlic naan. Both were spectacular and the family style servings make it easy to share. Perfect amount of heat and very reasonably priced. We will be back for the buffet to try a wider variety of items."}
{"text":"Called to check what items they had on their Sunday buffet as we had a large group with many vegetarians. The person that answered the phone (I know exactly who he is but am not putting his name in my comment to avoid getting him in trouble) responded rudely saying that I would have to personally go and check the menu items at the restaurant and that he was not going to give it on the phone. The only advice I have for this person is \"chill out dude\". There are many other nice restaurants in the area and I am taking my business elsewhere because of your poor attitude. I know you don't really care if the restaurant looses my business as you are an employee at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience! The food is always incredible, and there's always a ton of vegetarian options! Servers are always incredibly kind and attentive, and today our server, Madhu, gave us dessert on the house! 
If you haven't stopped in yet, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have tired mintt about 4 times each time I get the exact same meal and it always taste very different. I'm very disappointed because the first time I ate it was wonder but the flavor has weakened the last few times. Level 6 is not spice at all which is also disappointing."}
{"text":"I have only been here once for the lunch buffet. I went with two of my coworkers. We were ecstatic to have another Indian restaurant nearby. We were regulars at Zaiaka before they closed up. So we have been searching for another place ever since. When we walked in everyone was very nice and friendly, Our server or host gave us a small tour of the buffet. I thought the decor was welcoming and warming. Every dish I tried was fantastic and the naan was just right. The only problem was that we were blatantly overcharged. We were told the lunch buffet was $8.99 per person... so with tax applied that would be $9.62. First, the guy gave my friend the right price, then decided that was wrong and somehow charged us over $11.24, I questioned the price, but he just kinda ignored me and continued to charge all 3 of us $11.24 even my friend that paid cash. Still, $11 isn't bad for a buffet so we just went with it and didn't fight over a couple of dollars. Other than that... we will go back."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is so so good. I mean like I was there yesterday and I want to go back tomorrow. Food is fresh and hot. A server brought fresh Naan straight to our table! 
They offer a huge menu and have a nice dessert case up front. Goooooo now. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"V very good when manager is there 
In his absence very run-of-the-mill quality has come down since the start"}
{"text":"great food, good service. buffet has lots of varieties. good find."}
{"text":"Being amazed by their counterpart at Banksville Road, I was so happy to know that they opened in Monroeville where I live. The food is awesome and has been so every time I ate there. I usually do take-outs and more often than not they keep me waiting and thus the four stars. I have tried chicken biryani, chicken 555, chicken 65, samosa chaat, gongura mutton/goat/chicken/fish, tandoori shrimp, kashmiri chick, mutton biryani amongst other things. Every thing has been amazing every time I ordered. Some of my non-Indian friends did find the food spicier than what they are accustomed to so make sure to tone it down a bit as compared to other places but I love spicy and can't complain."}
{"text":"Soo good! Delicious food! I can't get enough of this place. Never had a bad dish. The buffet is small but every item is a hit. I would say spice level is \"white guy medium, medium plus\". Staff is extremely friendly without being annoying. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The lack of Indian restaurants in Greensburg requires us to travel a bit to find what is likely my favorite cuisine. There had been an excellent place in Plum, PA, but it closed. And we don't go to other places in Monroeville; one is all vegetarian (and we are meatatarians) and the other, where we used to frequent, has very uneven service. So when we heard about Mintt--just two doors down from Half Price Books!--we had to try it as soon as possible.

They close after their lunch buffet and then open for dinner at 5pm, and we made it just in time for their re-opening for dinner. We began with a samosa appetizer, which my wife pronounced the best we've had. They were larger than we were used to, and were surrounded with a delicious chick pea concoction.

For entrees, I had my usual, Chicken Korma, and my wife, who prefers Lamb Korma, had Goat Korma which was listed on the menu. I commented to her that perhaps it was good that I was writing the Yelp review, since she found the goat less tasty than the usual lamb, a also a bit rubbery, and with two bones in the serving. (But I include her comment here for complete honesty in reporting.)

However, my Chicken Korma was excellent. The Garlic Naan was also very good, and the portions were fine--after the large samosa, I left enough of my serving to take some Korma and Naan home for a later-in-the-week light lunch.

Dessert was an almond ice cream dish (sorry, I forgot the name). That was quite good as well. And so we are already recruiting friends for an expedition down to Monroeville for our next visit."}
{"text":"My first time trying this restaurant and it was absolutely delicious. I went for the lunch buffet and tried goat for the first time and it was very good. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Today is my second day in a row enjoying the buffet at Mintt. Believe it or not, it's actually better today! They have maybe half the dishes that are the same day to day, half that are different. The staff really hustles here and the manager is super friendly. So glad this place moved in here! I've also had dinner here and that's really good too. The chicken is good, the goat is better. Just wish I could find a place that makes roomali roti - I miss that more than anything from my travels to India....."}
{"text":"Aside from a small handful of decent Chinese and Mexican restaurants, Monroeville's been in need of some additional culture for a while now.  This a great new option to keep you from driving into the city for quality Indian food.  Service was fantastic; extremely friendly people.  Food was killer.  Restaurant was clean and well decorated.  Will definitely go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their food might on the spicier end for those who don't prefer too much spices I would suggest to Order level 3 or maybe even 2. Me on the other hand LOVE spicy food and their food taste soooo gooooddd! Wait is a little long when waiting for your food but it's definitely worth it. I enjoy all the flavors they use to make their dishes makes it better than the other Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I finally went here for lunch after hearing wonderful things from friends for a long time. The buffet had a wonderful variety and the food was absolutely delicious. Not only was the quality of the food excellent, but so was the service. The staff was present, checking in on how I liked the food and refilling drinks when necessary, and incredibly friendly, kind, and attentive. When I sat down, I was brought a whole pitcher of water to keep at the table, which was an added bonus that I really appreciated. Brief conversations with the staff made the experience feel personal. I can't recommend this place highly enough, for its fantastic food and warm, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and the food was tremendous. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went here in a business trip for dinner. Had the tandoori chicken. Also a cauliflower dish. Both were excellent. Surprising to find this quality of Indian food in Monroeville. If I am ever in town I will come back."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best new Indian/IndoChinese restaurant in and around Monroeville. The food is incredible!"}
{"text":"We accidentally stumbled upon this place. Lunch buffet was pretty decent, being a vegetarian I like the taste & the spread. Jamoon was awesome!"}
{"text":"Best Indian in Pittsburgh area. I live in the city, but it is worth the drive. Great prices, quick service. Delicious food. Been twice for for dinner, and left with food to take home both times because the portion sizes are so big. 

Hopefully I can make it to the buffet some day!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant to visit for Indian cuisine. The atmosphere is relaxing, the ambient music is lovely and the lighting is perfect. The first time we came here, my girlfriend and I were greeted personally by the owner who did an excellent job selling us on what was at the time a brand new establishment. We've since been back a handful of times and most recently were treated to a complimentary dessert by our waiter Madhu. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. This is where I refer whenever my friends ask for authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Just found this lunch buffet near my office and I'm so happy! The buffet food is perfectly spicy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"When your husband's Indian coworker recommends an Indian restaurant, you know it is going to be good.
We went on a Sunday afternoon which is a buffet time/day.  You can choose to order off the menu or the buffet.  Since it was our first time there, we decided it would be fun to try a variety of items.  I was impressed with the selection.  They had a lot more variety than the typical Indian buffet.  So much so that I actually had to look up what some of the entrees were.  I have to say that everything I tried was tasty.  Each dish had unique flavor and character and they weren't kidding about when they said dishes were spicy.
One of my favorites was the chili paneer.  I love paneer, so it was a different treat to have it in the sweet and spicy sauce.  I also enjoyed the mango yogurt (which was more like ice cream because it was frozen)

In addition to the tasty food, the service was wonderful.  We had our 2.5 year olds with us and we're at the in between stage of whether they'll sit in a high chair, booster or regular seat.  When they wanted regular seats the staff was quick to get regular chairs without complaint.  They were also good with the kids, asking if we needed anything different for them.  They even asked if it was ok to give them a Twizzler at the end of the meal.  It was refreshing to have staff that was friendly to toddlers instead of rolling their eyes just because you walk in the door.

We'll definitely be back, both for regular food and the buffet."}
{"text":"The food here is so good I cried happy tears of joy for hours. Delicious and friendly staff. A++++++"}
{"text":"Only have been here for lunch buffet. Price is very good compared to what you get. Various options and I like to order mango lassi for drink. All tasty!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie biryani and garlic naan. The naan was really well cooked. I enjoyed it. They biryani was good but not amazing. It did not get as many veggies as I'd like. It was limited to a couple big hunks of carrot, a couple hunks of potato, and a few peas and shredded carrots. My first bites, I thought the flavor was great, but by the end it tasted a little overly salted to me. I also ended up with a lot of rice with no veggies left about halfway through. I had asked for extra raita, but didn't get it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. Servers are nice, the restaurant is clean, and the food is awesome. I will be returning for when I need my Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"This restaurant popped up when we were looking for an Indian restaurant while driving from WV to Niagara Falls.
We tried their buffet. Food was very delicious and servers were very attentive too."}
{"text":"A variety buffet plate at Mint in Monroeville. This place has anexcellent reputation and lives up to it!  Unlike Chinese restaurant buffets, the Indian buffets are all different and varied.  The Chicken Biryani rice here is outstanding, as are all the vegetarian options. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I think this is the best place for Indian food in Pittsburgh. The buffet has so much variety on weekends! There is a hot dosa (crepes) bar with various options.Sometimes, they also do ala carte during buffet.

There food is value for money. Buffet costs $13 per person. They also do takeout for buffet and they don't charge by weight. 

There is lot of open parking."}
{"text":"The food here was very good! The staff was polite, but not very attentive once our meals were brought out though. No one came by to check whether we needed refills on our beverages. This was a problem because the food was spicy, so I really needed more water! Eventually I had to get up and find a server to bring us more to drink. Another beverage let down was that this restaurant doesn't serve any alcohol. Not even wine! Aside from the few problem areas, I would most likely give this place another shot."}
{"text":"The manager is so rude and disrespectful ... treats you like you are here to get free food.
Buffet is average and you have to keep asking for refills...will never go back"}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times as take out and never disappoints. Palak paneer is always a great choice"}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday dinner. I liked the ambiance better than any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh :) We ordered butter chicken, kadhai paneer and gobhi aloo. The waiter delivered kadhai chicken by mistake instead of paneer and was ready to replace it but we decided to keep it and it was a good decision because the dish was tasty. The best one of the three was the butter chicken! All of my family loved it. We loved all of the food including the garlic naan. The waiter in the end served us two complementary desserts to make up for his mistake. The paan flavored kulfi was my favorite! :) I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have come for the lunch buffet and at dinner, both I had good experiences. Place is clean, the food is always delicious and comes out very fast at dinner. Lunch buffet has good options at a good price, naan is always super yummy. Best Indian restaurant around."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel among the many buffet lunch Indian joints in the Burgh.  I can honestly say that I have never had better.  Plop this place downtown, and it would be a goldmine.

I stopped in for the ubiquitous Indian lunch buffet, and was amazed from the moment I entered. Classy surroundings and fast, friendly service.  

Neat tables and the waiter immediately poured me a water and left the pitcher.  Which was a good thing, as the spice levels here were right on the money.  And by that, I mean SPICY!

The entrees were widely varied and contained a good mix of vegetarian to meat choices.  About half and half.  Even as a staunch carnivore, my favorite dish (of the twelve or so options) was a spicy vegan eggplant curry.

I am an avid Indian food \"luncher,\" and stop by a \"meat plus two veg sides\" (Sree's or Bombay Gyro) place about once a week.  I rarely order off of the menu at restaurants due to my utter lack of knowledge of the language and cuisine.  I'd rather try a bit of everything, but never remember the names.

Everything was amazingly tasty and obviously fresh.  I loved the varied choices of rice:  a brown, a jasmine, and one with herbs and veggies.  I'm not sure of the reason, but the rices were levitating above the buffet trays on a base of saran wrap.  I almost wanted to pop it! 

The spice level can suit anyone.  I loove spicy, and I found a dish that was too hot for my taste buds. Others range from about 2 to 7, with condiments to up the heat. 

If it weren't over an hour away, I would be there weekly."}
{"text":"What a great location and the decor and ambience is outstanding. We were greeted by a friendly host and the waiter we had explained the menu to us. We got complimentary papad and chutney and prompt water glasses. Very efficient service for sure. The owner came out to also greet us very nice touch. We got the garlic cauliflower and samosa chaat as appetizers both great choices. For dinner the lamb seekh kebab which came sizzling on a skillet very tender and flavorful. All done great food and service."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The prices are pretty good considering the serving that you get! The food is delicious!  Also, the staff is helpful and very nice.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"SHERRY S and I both love this place but we omitted the 5th star on her first review(lol)great place and gracious owners ..5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this plaza for a while and I am now kicking myself for not visiting Mintt earlier! This is by far the BEST Indian food I've ever had. They have a wonderful selection of traditional foods on their buffet. Everything that I tried was flavorful and delicious. I highly recommend their butter chicken which is packed with flavor and spices. Overall you can't go wrong with stopping in for a bite to eat during their buffet hours or enjoy a great dinner with friends and/or family."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Indian cuisine. Amazing service. I messed up my order and they swapped? it out for the right stuff without a question. Will be back again."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian spot. This place has the most authentic Indian dishes- love the bindi masala! I haven't had the chance to come to the dinner buffet but hear it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!  We came for dinner and ordered a variety of our favorite dishes.  The quality of everything was great!  Wonderful flavors and excellent food quality.  We are so happy to finally have a top notch Indian restaurant on this site of town.   Very nice décor and ambiance as well."}
{"text":"I usually go to the mintt in banksville. I decided to try the mintt in Monroeville after looking at the good reviews on Yelp. The place looks clean and new. 

We ordered chicken 65 and special biryani. I ordered a spice level of 10. From my previous experience with many Indian restaurants, I thought I could take the spice. But, 10 is very spicy. I understood that they follow the authentic spice standards. So, be aware of that. If you are looking for spicy food, go for 8 and less spicy food, go for 4 or 5. 

Though my intial order was spicy, the restaurant staff added extra rice to the biryani to reduce the spice level. They also brought me the mango lassi to help with the spice. Not everyone do that and I am flattered by that gesture. Everything tasted good and have authentic flavours. I highly recommend this place. 

I overheard other customers appreciating the food and planning to come back again. Staff were nice and friendly. I will go back again!"}
