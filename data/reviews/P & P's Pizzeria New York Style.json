{"text":"The best pizza in the area.   The couple that owns it is friendly and so nice.   The pizza is always piping hot when delivered as well"}
{"text":"Crust thin and just really chewy. Maybe that's how NY style pizza is supposed to be but not for me. Dough ball in stomach for days."}
{"text":"This our favorite pizza in cleveland area.  The best New Youk Style pizza around.  My kids only eat p and p....they love the garlic knots.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Meh. Not terrible, but exactly the kind of pizza you would expect from a low rent strip mall pizza joint. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if that were possible."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever eaten! Love the crust and the sauce is wonderful. Everything is very fresh. This is the only pizza we eat."}
{"text":"Best pizza around here. New York style slices made by real Italians. Family owned and operated. Always Friendly staff. We always pick up or have it delivered. The inside is kind of small to dine in."}
{"text":"Great pepperoni and white pizza, best in Mentor.  If they would only use real sausage then I would have to move into the back room!"}
{"text":"P&P's has some of the best pizza around, always consistent, always good!  Try the meatball, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Exactly my style. Thin New York style crust that's both crunchy and chewy. Just like it should be. Perfect sauce, not over garlicy not over sweetened. Wish I lived closer to eat more often"}
{"text":"I live in California, so the only time I get P & P's is when I'm home visiting the parental units.  And you can be damned sure that when I'm here, we're getting take out from this joint.  Chewy thin crust, garlic-y tomato sauce, more than generous cheese...and I'm drooling again.  Mom-unit swears by the white pizza.  Wish I could find 'za this good on the left coast."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza here for dinner based on the good reviews. The pizza was OK, didn't taste fresh, and the bread felt like hard chewy cardboard dough. I must've caught them at a bad time and got a bad pizza because I woke up at 1am with excruciating abdominal pain and have spent the last 12 hours with symptoms of food poisoning. Never eating or ordering from here again. I haven't had a stomachache all year and to get this much stomach pain and \"other symptoms\" just from eating 3 skinny slices from here is outrageous.  Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up on New Jersey pizza...living in Ohio now...have had to deal with sub par pizza...until now. This is great pizza...and their mushrooms are seasoned and give it extra oomph...will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm! A little pricier than most in the area but well worth it. Fresh ingredients authentic cheese. Fantastic salads. Delicious calzones. Absolute best pizza in Lake county. When we want pizza this is where we go."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Mentor/Concord area. My family's go to ordering spot. Owner is very personable will share stories of his life growing up in Italy"}
{"text":"This pizza was awful. The crust was bisquick-ish and undercooked. The cheese was very salty. There wasn't enough sauce. We only ate this pizza after adding spaghetti sauce fro a can to it. If I had a choice between the pizza I got here or a frozen pizza - I would choose the frozen. Absolutely Awful."}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in Cleveland the difference in the quality of the cheese makes it amazing don't forget the cannoli!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this mom and pop pizza shop. I have been going here for over 20 years and they never disappoint. They have the best NY style pizza around cooked by a genuine Italian. (What more could you ask for?!) Whether you want just a slice or a whole pie this is the place to go. Their salads are great too and perfect for sharing. They only use the best and freshest ingredients and it shows.  This place is a tradition in my family."}
{"text":"The calzone is the best item in the menu. The pizza is a 9 out of 10  and the wings are juicy with the perfect amount of seasoning."}
{"text":"Pp's is authentic Italian with good old \"down home\" service! The menu is pretty typical so don't expect the unusual...just good pizza & pasta dishes.  It's our goto place for delivery when we don't want to cook or eat out.  Get your card punched for a freebie."}
{"text":"I have lived all over the Cleveland area and have had pizza almost everywhere.  I can 100 percent say that this is HANDS DOWN the best pizza in Cleveland.   I started riding my bike there as a kid and fell in love.  It became a once a week spot guaranteed all the way up until I moved to California.  I even continued the tradition when I went to college, downtown.  Classmates and I would take 30 min road trips to P and P's once a week because we all unanimously agreed it was the best pizza in town and 100 percent worth the trip!  I live in Los Angeles now and P & P's is always my 1st stop upon coming back to Cleveland and my last food stop before flying back.  That's not an exaggeration.  I will usually get P & P's 3 - 4 times within a 10-14 day visit home.  Not only do I feel strongly that it is the best pizza in Cleveland, but I have yet to have pizza anywhere in LA (or California) that tops it.  I highly recommend you order by the pie rather than the slice.    If I had a magic lamp and a genie granted me three wishes, I'd spend all three of them on bringing P and P's to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I have yet to be to another very authentic pizza place! P&P's hands down my personal favorite!! Very friendly staff. I just wish they'd deliver to me in MOL/Willoughby border!!"}
{"text":"This is NOT New York style pizza.  This is average, at best, Cleveland style pizza.  I've been dying for New York style pizza near mentor/painesville.  I'm still searching..."}
