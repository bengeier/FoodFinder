{"text":"A great place to drop in for a quick homemade meal and some dessert.  We had some fried chicken on a stick and some schnitzel, it was great. The cheesecake, apple and blueberry desserts were excellent."}
{"text":"Rude, obnoxious behaviour that I have never come across before in my entire life. The owner has absolutely no manners. I live an hour away and have called to inquire if they had an item in stock before driving down, and he hung up on me three separate times while I was mid-sentence.   I would not give my business to them."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. It offers Polish food and service at its best: no-nonsense, low-cost and SUPER tasty. It actually costs less to buy a delicious, light, tender chicken breast schnitzel here than it costs to buy an uncooked chicken breast down the street at Sobey's. They consistently have cute little seasonally-themed figurines in the window, and have recently renovated the inside so that it looks nicer. The staff members aren't incredibly friendly, but they're not rude either... They're just efficient. I've learned that they like it if you have exact change. Na zdrowie!"}
{"text":"I bought a slice of honey cake from here and I absolutely loved it. I wish I took a picture of it, but the thought only occurred to me after I finished the cake. Next time!"}
