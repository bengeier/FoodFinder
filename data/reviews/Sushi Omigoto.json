{"text":"I normally don't review, but the service here was superb! We came here for a birthday celebration and the service was amazing, food was excellent (sashimi platter was gorgeous) and the atmosphere was terrific. I highly recommend this resto. Good job guys."}
{"text":"By far this is one of my best sushi place, staff is very friendly and the food is just amazing! I use to think ayce sushi is the place to go to get full without paying too much but I was wrong."}
{"text":"Everything was good until we waited more than 30mins for our food. Only 3 people in the restaurant. Takeout delivery took priority over restaurant customers who have option to tip. Fish was warm by the time it got to the table. Don't waste your time on this one. Only thing nice about the restaurant is the decor and tv."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother on a weekday lunch. We arrived around 12:30, and the restaurant was completely empty. There's lots of space in the restaurant and quite clean.  For food, we ordered the bulgogi dish and the maki special of the day. Bulgogi was nothing special (even for Mississauga). However the spicy salmon was excellent for its price! Compared to other sushi places in Mississauga, this place is great for grabbing a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Second time ordering here (first time was take out and the lady on the phone was so patient and nice!!!). We loved our experience dining in here. Waitresses were attentive and all very nice. They constantly came to check on our tea and made sure our food was good. The atmosphere is nice and although it's hidden, it's a decent place for raw fish cravings (no fishy taste, yay!). For the price you pay, it's not bad at all! Next time I'll be asking for less sauce on my maki rolls as it was a bit salty.  We also overheard the head waitress (we believe) talking to the other waitresses saying \"don't ask me, figure it out yourselves!\" It was a bit uncomfortable and we felt bad for the other waitresses. We hope they don't experience this on the daily..."}
{"text":"This is the best place! I love the food and the service.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  Dorothy is the best! :)   I have been here 5 times in the last 3 months.  I would go more often if I could. The Sushi Love roll was YUMMY! and the Omigoto Combo is to die for.  Best Sushi hands down."}
{"text":"Love love their service, quality, management, professionalism and dedication to providing a high-end experience.  Although a new establishment, it certainly left a mark for me!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious avocado & salmon sushi with gluten free soya sauce, sizzling Korean dish as the main course. Which had beef, rice, veggies and more. It was truly delicious and was served sizzling hot with an egg on top! My Mom also got miso soup (has gluten in it though) as well as a sushi plate that she said was delicious and I got a salad with no sauce on it as the sauce had gluten. The hostess was very accommodating with my gluten free restrictions. Dinner was served with hot tea and hot sauce. It was a very nice atmosphere with tv's with movies of Korean food being made in Korea and lovely music playing. Servers very very nice. I will most definitely be back - this is truly a gem in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! High quality food, friendly staff and great ambiance. Currebtly one of the best sushi places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Great service! Always go there for sushi because is close to where I live and food is amazing..."}
{"text":"Great sushi a la Carter option in Mississauga. Really good torches sushi. Also good options for non-sushi eaters, like ramen and bulgogi. I think this will become my go to sushi resto in Sauga! Finally a sushi place I can come back to. Yum!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the sushi places I've been to in Mississauga and Brampton (a la carte & ayce), this is by far the best restaurant I've been to! It is, how people have said a lil overpriced, but I would definitely go here again!!!! The quality of the sushi is too bomb to resist"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and delicious, fresh food! It's still relatively new so the service can be a bit slow, but the staff are very understanding and accommodating!  We arrived here almost at 1pm and were seated promptly. However, because the restaurant was understaffed, we didn't get tea or anything until Dorothy (one of the servers) came by. She took our orders promptly and gave us tea. Unfortunately, even then we waited for over 20 minutes with nothing further - no tea refills, no miso soup or salad (which came with the lunch set). At one point, we saw the waitress come with miso soup only to be redirected to another table (she literally was ready to set down the soup).  I asked the server whether the wait would be much longer, as we were in quite a rush. Immediately, she apologized and Dorothy came over to handle our requests instantly. She asked us if we wanted a soup refill (which was ironic, as we never even got soup to begin with), gave us edamame on the house, and promised that our meals would be ready in 10 minutes. And she delivered on that promise! The servers were very friendly and understanding.  I thoroughly enjoyed my sushi and sashimi lunch set. The fish was fresh and al dente. I particularly liked the seared white tuna; it was fatty and tasty. The rice was packed at the right density, and wasn't too acidic by any means. The texture and flavour was just right! Their lunch sets are also of amazing value - my mom got the maki roll set and we walked home with 12 individual pieces left over. Crazy!   When we paid using cash (you get 5% off with cash), Dorothy came over again to apologize for the slow service and upped the discount to 10%. She emphasized that she appreciates us all as customers and hope we'll still return despite today's slow service. And we will! The amazing customer service and high quality food definitely means that Sushi Omigoto is a good place to come back to... But next time we'll make sure we have sufficient time."}
{"text":"We came here on October 5th, 2017 for a birthday celebration. I will cut to the chase for those who don't want to read the full review: we had a great time and everyone left feeling full and satisfied. I encourage people to come here and definitely try both the sushi and the desserts.   Now to get into the details: -We had a party of 10, and there was an ample amount of space, any extra people would definitely have been accommodated for. Definitely recommend coming here for parties.  -The restaurant itself is clean and the decor is very nice and modern. The atmosphere was pleasant, we stayed for 3 hours and they flew by quite quickly.  -The server was very pleasant and helpful, she explained the dishes thoroughly, joked around with us, and was always there when we needed something. An example is them shutting off the A/C when some of us got chilly. Great service overall! -The sushi was fresh and delicious. Some of us were newbies to sushi while others were seasoned veterans, and everyone was happy with what they got. We started off with P20, a 95 piece assortment of sashimi, nigiri, and maki. (PRO TIP: call ahead if you want something this large. Coming in and having it ready to eat was perfect given how hungry we were.) Later we got their Thursday special, a 3 roll platter costing a mere 13 bucks - what a great deal! Finally, the Las Vegas roll (served engulfed in flames) was both yummy and a cool birthday thing since the guest of honor blew out the fire like a birthday cake candle! -The dessert was scrumptious, I recommend getting the dessert platter and trying everything since it's all so good! We ended up ordering another platter, and 3 individual desserts (bigger than they are on the platter by the way) after that.  I'll end this by saying that this place is definitely worth checking out. Big thanks to the staff for making our celebration a great one."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here almost by accident with a buddy, and have been back several times since. Not as good a deal as the all you can eat places for the money, but the food is excellent and I leave full, but not having overdone it. I have been here several times for lunch and dinner, and both menus are excrllent. They have a daily special. I recommend the house special omigoto roll."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot to come and get some great quality service and food! I normally only eat at AYCE sushi restaurants because I want to make sure I get a good amount for my $$$ but the portions and prices here are beyond fair. You get a great quality meal and leave the table satisfied. Jessica has been our server during our visits and her great personality really adds to the experience. 1000% recommend to come check this place out !"}
{"text":"4 and a half stars for a mediocre sushi restaurant well that's about to change. The sushi here was okay and that's me being nice. I also ordered tonkatsu, you could tell that the sauce they had for the it had a ketchup base and I can still taste the strong ketchup taste. Normally tonkatsu sauce shouldn't taste as strong as the ketchup they added to that sauce. Honestly, I wouldn't comeback and I would rather spend my money somewhere elses. The sushi here breaks and doesn't retain it shape. The price is overpriced for what they offer. I I didn't have anything positive to say about this place, everything was just plain lifeless in this restaurant; the vibe, the servers, and the food."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have EVER been to. I'm telling everyone about this place. The second I took the first bite I was sold. Sushi always tastes fresh. Very reasonable prices and good menu selection as well. The staff is always super welcoming and go above and beyond."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I've ever been to.  Try the smoky roll. It's delicious and they give you a cool show when they serve it."}
{"text":"Come for lunch, more worth it than dinner. There wasn't much variety or the classics I find here .  The food was pretty good and the sashimi was fresh. The cashier was very nice and attentive. The only problem I had was price .. it is more expensive than I'm use to.  The free soba appetizer was a nice touch !"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this gem of a restaurant I just found.  Came in with friends for dinner and they were most accommodating when we asked for separate bills.  We ordered a wide variety of items from the menu (seafood udon, ramen, sashimi, sushi, bento boxes), everything was very fresh and delicious! No complaints from any of our guests.  Servers were warm, friendly and helpful.  Will surely come back when we're in the area.  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Sushi Omigoto is located in the Mississauga Chinese Centre just west the bottom of Tomken and just east of Haines at the very back of the mall on the right side of the fountain.  I remember this place being a Vietnamese place a while back but now that it's a full menu Korean and sushi menu I have to say this change was for the better.  The menu is graphic but although there's a lot of choices there's a bit of flare to it as well.  Korean options are some of the more popular known dishes like bulgogi, kalbi, bibimbap but the sushi menu is also full with a la carte offerings by rolls, special rolls, nigiri and combos as well.  As far as a la carte sushi, Sushi Omigoto has some good variety and mix of combos so basically if you're just looking for a single serving sized combo or an entire party platter sized tray, the option to go small or big is there.  You can tell what kind of level an a la carte place is based on a couple things.  Do they offer toro?  Do they offer uni (urchin)?  Well this place has some sort of \"edible gold\" dish.  I don't think I'd consider it because it seems a little superfluous to have bling food but for what it's worth one of the dishes I had asked for had a bit of flare to it but it's not all for show.  The Chef's volcano roll is plated on its own and although flashy and visually pleasing, is tasty and not just eye candy.  This roll has tuna and salmon, crab, and shrimp with drizzles and dots of different sauces.  It's as attractive as it is tasty.  The tempura adds a nice crunch texture compliment.  Salmon skin roll which is one of my favorites is done nicely here.  The skin has a definite crunch to it so you won't be cheated on that roll.  In addition to all this I also went with a P5 combo which is a sashimi, red dragon and nigiri 23 piece combo.    For a la carte, Sushi Omigoto may not be a traditional Japanese place like Masayuki in Burlington but the flare, variety and quality of servings make it a very strong choice for a la carte sushi.  The menu overall is quite impressive for having a large sushi menu but also for having good Korean options as well.    Sushi Omigoto to me is a definite go to place for a la carte sushi.  I like the extensive choices and far better than AYCE quality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend enjoys Sushi Omigoto and it is close to home for both of us. The service is always fantastic. I also enjoy the ambiance as it is well decorated and they have a TV screen with a live stream of the streets of Japan! I have never been disappointed with their food, the salmon paradise is definitely a favourite. The price is fair, not the cheapest meal because of the rising prices of seafood, but the quality is by far the best you can get."}
{"text":"Fast, efficient service. Got the Salmon Paradise combo and Opening Special. Everything tasted great, hopes the fish was abit more colder it seemed more in the warm side. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"This place is new, our waitress told us they opened two months ago! We are here from the United States and stumbled across this restaurant when looking for a place to eat sushi, and I'm so glad we chose this place! It's family owned, the service was amazing, and our waitress was incredibly nice. The location of this place is the only flaw, other than that, the restaurant is perfect! Cool atmosphere, good music, once this place gets their alcohol license I could totally see this as a hot spot for families and friends getting together! 10/10 would recommend. Thank you Sushi Omigoto for you exceptional service!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place for takeout! Their sushi is amazing an has a unique fresh taste to some unique rolls. I have to admit I am not easy to please with sushi and I've been to so many great and mediocre places. This one falls with the greats for flavour and freshness for sure. The one thing I'd say is that I went to eat in once and the weather wasn't so good and the power was on and off which meant our menu choices were limited to anything that is served cold. They were really nice about it, and I'd say they're gracious hosts. I would have preferred it a little cleaner but I wouldn't say it's dirty or anything. I'd definitely go back for takeout or dine-in. A bit on the pricey side but if you glance at the menu and don't mind that I think it would be safe to assume you'll like the food."}
{"text":"(Food:)   The LAS VEGAS ROLL was pretty good.  It was served on a flaming platter which is a nice touch, but was quite saucy.    The BLACK DRAGON AND GREEN DRAGON ROLL were both standard dragon rolls as well.  (Price:)  LAS VEGAS ROLL: $14.95 ( typical price) GREEN DRAGON ROLL: $11.95 BLACK DRAGON ROLL: $13.95  (Service and Ambience): Standard  (Comparable:) Nothing can beat Mi-Ne restaurant to me.  (Overall:) It was a standard Japanese restaurant.  I was slightly disappointed just because of the high Yelp Ratings.  But, still deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was recommend by many friends to try this place out since my favourite food is sushi and this really did not disappoint!   I brought my step brother here on a Sunday evening and we were seated immediately, it wasn't too busy or packed.   We ordered the Volcano Roll, the roll that's on fire (I forgot the name) and Salmon Paradise.   All the rolls we're good portions, I usually opt out from a la carte because I feel like it's overpriced and I don't get what I pay for but this is not the case. My favourite roll would be the Volcano Roll, super yummy and there's so much going on. Would definitely be getting this again. The flaming one was alright, it was a dynamite roll with cheese on top surrounded by fire. Ill be honest I got this because it looked cool but I don't think I'll be getting this again. The Salmon Paradise is worth it as well even if it's just for yourself since it has salmon sashimi, salmon sushi and salmon roll.   Highly recommend this place, affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have EVER had in Mississauga. It is so delicious with explosions of flavours and beautiful playing 12/2 review!! :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi here, prices were great and sushi was fresh and tasted good. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here with a family of 4, we ordered one of their platters with sushi/sashimi/rolls. My party liked salmon more and asked to have more salmon instead of some of the items and they were nice enough to accomodate that without charging extra. Miso soup was TOO SALTY, hard to drink.   Also ordered a Korean pork bone soup and did not like the taste, too many pieces of bone shredded in the soup so it's not fun to eat the meat and have to avoid the small bone fragments, not authentic at all...they should stick to their japanese cuisine which tasted better."}
{"text":"Hidden at the back of Mississauga's chinatown but has a great decor inside, very modern and classy.  Sushi was excellent, very big pieces."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I found this place through Yelp! One of the best sushi experiences my husband and I have had. When you come to Sushi Omigoto, from the outside it looks like an unassuming little restaurant. The decor is stylish, service is friendly and helpful and the food is fantastic!   My husband is usually a fan of all you can eat sushi places, but we wanted to try Sushi Omigoto and have a nicer evening out. We ordered the Tuna Tataki, Chef's Volcano Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Salmon Paradise and ended with the matcha cheesecake and ice cream.   We were given a complimentary noodle soup with crunchy tempura bits in it. The soup was delicious! We could have easily (and were very tempted to) order a large bowl of the soup. We thought if the soup is this good, how is the food going to be?  The volcano roll was delicious and served with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and spicy salmon sashimi. The Las Vegas roll was nicely presented on top of flaming salt! The sashimi and sushi in the salmon paradise were melt in your mouth tender. The spicy salmon roll had crispy tempura bits on top which added nice texture (sometimes you go to places and they just use Pablo bread crumbs and it's disappointing). The tuna tataki was nicely seared and seasoned and garnished with pickled jalapeño and caramelized onions.    I like the flavour of matcha but I've been burned by matcha flavoured desserts in the past, either they taste gritty or have an earthy flavour, but not the case here. The cheesecake and ice cream were creamy and had that touch of tea bitterness which was tasty.   Bill was reasonable, after tax, we ended up paying about $72, which is what we'd pay for all you can eat. Portions were a great size, as we had to take some home. A great experience, we will definitely return to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was amazing and the waitress was the most pleasant I've ever encountered so far."}
{"text":"From California and I just HAD to see what the food scene was around here. Not disappointed.  Great atmosphere, good service, parking easy, food great.   More later when I finish..."}
{"text":"Just ordered this off Skip the dishes. Horrible. Worst sushi experience I have ever had. The soy sauce was ALL salt Got delivered and it it was leaking everywhere. I understand that the driver may have been responsible but no measures were taken to prevent this. No double bag no knots nothing. The sushi wasn't fresh and the salmon wasn't good at all. Was very disappointed. Didn't finish the sushi."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here on a Saturday afternoon to have a birthday lunch and Sushi Omigoto was a really nice place for us. It wasn't busy and therefore not too loud for us to talk. It did end up getting busier but the atmosphere is dim and relaxed so things stayed fairly quiet. I asked her what star rating I should use and she thought I was nuts for not automatically going with five.  I'll start by saying they have the best miso soup I've had. We ordered the vegetable tempura, a dynamite roll, and the bulgogi hot pot. All very good and super fresh. The hot pot could use more meat but I won't dock it any points for that because it was still delicious. We also ordered the rainbow dragon roll for as take out for someone at home - he said it was the best roll he has had in a while (and he's got fairly picky taste when it comes to sushi).  There are two screens (that I could see from where I was sitting) with neat things on them to watch. One had video of different food items being made and the other had video of someone walking around Tokyo. These were much more interesting than the CP24 ticker going by.  Finally, our waitress was very nice and prompt. We're not ones to like to sit around for long after we are done and she was very attentive. She didn't let me forget to order the take out item! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best ala cart sushi restaurants I've been to, it's not AYCE unfortunately. The service was excellent, so was the food. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it a lot. Also, if you pay by cash, you'll save an additional 5% off your bill."}
{"text":"Love the friendly and fast service, and atmosphere of the restaurant. Nothing to complain about for the food. It was fresh and the servings were large."}
{"text":"This is one of the newer sushi place in Mississauga, so we decided to give them a try for dinner.   We ordered the 48 piece sushi platter, the volcano roll and various tempura.  I was extremely impressed by the quality and freshness of the  fish and how well presented everything was.  I highly recommend the volcano roll which tasted as good as it looked.  The tempura was also extremely well done, as it crispy and not greasy at all.    The restaurant is very modern, clean and sleek and a nice change to the other sushi options in the city.  The service was excellent as the person who served us was very cheerful and friendly and easily accommodated our request to have more salmon pieces for our sushi platter.  I will definitely return and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and read good reviews on the service here, surprisingly when we walked in we were not greeted for a good 5mins, and then attempted to get someone's attention for another 5mins until we finally walked up to the sushi counter and tried to flag someone down to seat us (There were many empty tables).   Food and service after this was great. We tried 3 rolls for 2 people and was definitely filling. Their rolls selection was unique and the torches tuna was our favourite. Would like to visit again to try the rest of this menu"}
{"text":"We were up in Mississauga, and Lee and his son wanted to have some ramen. Most of the other ramen places were closed, but we decided to head to the Mississauga Chinese Centre and see what was around.  This place looked interesting, there wasn't a lot of traffic at the time, but the menu looked to have an interesting variety, including ramen, so we decided to give it a try.  We started off with an avocado roll to start, it was really great - nice fresh avocado, nicely presented. I had a bulgogi bowl, and Lee and his son both had ramen bowls.  We also had green tea and black sesame ice cream to finish off. All of it was really delicious!  Service was overall very friendly and welcoming. It was a little slow at the end, but nothing that was excessively annoying. We'd definitely go here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi, located in a very cool Asian pavilion on Dundas, Sushi Omigoto has a feeling of authenticity. The portions are generous, the price is great. Most of all the sushi is very fresh, and at a perfect temperature. Great for lunches or dinner!"}
{"text":"A definite add to our sushi restaurant rotation.  Pros - fresh, delicious beautifully presented sushi - sushi rice was soft and didn't overpower the fish - modern, clean, hip decor - bonus points for delicious complimentary soup - prices were reasonable for this quality of sushi   Cons - slow service, I think it was about 30min from ordering to getting our food. We ordered the chef's choice sushi so that might take longer. It was also still relatively full at 9pm for dinner on a Friday night - they also didn't let us know that the soju we ordered wasn't available until we asked about it 10min after  Consensus - a solid sushi restaurant that we'll likely visit again for the delicious sushi and sleek decor. Hopefully the service will improve"}
{"text":"A run of the mill mississauga sushi establishment. I'm not quite sure why it was rated so high.   We got the chef choice sushi and sashimi platter. It came with a variety of sashimi, nigiri and 2 maki rolls. We also got a specialty roll on the side. The rolls were okay, nothing to rave about but for some reason the specialty roll was just drenched in sauce. The bottom was so soggy and salty I'm not sure what possessed them to put the roll in a bed of teriyaki soy sauce.  The nigiri were not good. Simply because their rice is horrendous. It is sticky and clumpy and they put so much rice. I've had ayce that had much better quality sushi rice than this place. It was over cooked and not seasoned properly. I just can't with the rice.  On to the sashimi - their sashimi was placed on a bed of plastic fake daikon.... we had to pick it off our food multiple times. You're not supposed to put anything that isn't edible on the plate much less as a foundation to your sashimi.... it just left a really bad taste in my mouth. The presentation is very cheap and tacky.  The red tuna is not fresh.   I would avoid this place, don't get your hopes up, their yelp score is not reflective of the quality of this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great value, friendly staff great portions, went early and  staff took their time with us. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"TIP:  5% discount for CASH payments.  Located at the end unit inside the original Mississauga Chinatown, Sushi Omigoto was a former pho place.  Smart location as there are no other sushi places within a close proximity!  Parking can be a bit tight, especially near Blue Lagoon.  Atmosphere:  Modern, newly renovated.  There's a big screen tv that plays CP24.  It's pretty dim inside though, especially if you sit away from the windows.  There are a mix of mini booths and tables.  Food:  There are *LUNCH SPECIALS*, prices are quite average for the offerings.  My mom ordered a Bulgogi & Sushi bento box ($12.95), but a side miso/salad arrived before the bento that still came with a salad.  My Sushi, Sashimi & Handroll ($12.95) lunch was fine.  As pictured, the spicy salmon handroll came with tempura bits with the spicy mayo mixed with the salmon.  Everything tasted fine, nothing really stood out.  Yes, there were more pieces of salmon than any other kind of fish which, in the 'burbs, is to be expected.  Not bad, yet not a super memorable experience either."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience in this restaurant a lot. Perfect atmosphere of chill, waiters are super friendly and food is amazing. The waiter kindly recommended us appetizers and the main course and it was totally worth it. Definitely will come back when I'm in Toronto next time."}
{"text":"By far, my favourite sushi place in the GTA!   I've visited two times: one on a weekend night and during the weekday. Though the weekend was the busiest (obvs), the service was amazing! Right when you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the sushi chefs behind the counter and servers. Though the place may be small, the atmosphere is really chill and the interior design of the place is beautiful!   The food was amazing as well! My first time, I got the Unagi Stone Rice Bowl and shared a platter of sushi with my family. The Rice Bowl was delicious, especially because they add a bit of melted butter along with the rice and unagi sauce. The second time I went, I shared a sushi platter with my boyfriend. Both times, the sushi was so fresh and worth its price. Personally, I was never a big fan of tuna but, I think this place may have changed that. The highlight of the meals were the thick slices of butterfish, salmon and unagi!"}
{"text":"Just when we thought that KAOI SUSHI is our go-to spot for Japanese and Korean food in Mississauga -- we discovered SUSHI OMIGOTO. The surprising part is-- it is owned and run by same people and owner. No wonder why it is not just as good, but even better!  Nice ambiance, DELICIOUS FOOD, and great price!! Perfect for casual dates, group celebration, and take-outs.   They do have LUNCH DEALS which I believe they offer from 1130pm-330pm. Price ranging from $9-$15 and that already includes MISO SOUP, SALAD, (and some even with rice).    Their SPICY BULGOGI, HOT STONE BOWLS, and BENTO boxes deals are out of this world.   Volcano roll, and Las Vegas roll are definitely their top sellers. ($14.95)  LOVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Servers are very respectful, and accommodating with request. We probably come here at least 8-10x a MONTH!! The service & food is that GOOD!!! We brought along bunch of our friends, and families - and this restaurant did NOT disappoint! It just keeps getting better, and better each time. The servers and chefs take pride on what they do!   And to top it all. They offer 5% discount on your bill when you pay in cash. NEED I SAY MORE????"}
{"text":"Umm WOW! Sushi Omigato has to be the best find my boyfriend and I stumbled upon by chance. We were originally planning to stop by the food court in China town to grab a quick bite but passed by sushi omigato and decided to give this place a try.   The ambiance and decor is very sleek and gives off the \"high end\" vibes - think of the a la carte places downtown like Saku. The atmosphere is very similar to that. We were seated right away and it was fairly busy for a Saturday morning which was a very good sign. The menu consists of both Japanese and korean food and tbh everything looked and sounded good.   I decided to try their special rolls - the red green dragon roll and salmon love roll. BRUH.. my taste buds are thanking me still!! The red green roll was basically half red roll and half green roll which is a good option for those who can never pick between the two (like me LOL). The salmon love roll is my absolute favourite roll ever, not just at Omigato but out of any sushi restaurants I've been too. It's spicy salmon roll with torched salmon on top and spicy mayo  everything I love combined into one! The portions were very good I was so full and struggled finishing the rest. Even my bf thought I ordered 3 rolls not 2.   My boyfriend ordered the salmon paradise which came with spicy salmon rolls, salmon sushi and sashimi. It doesn't sound much but it was enough to fill up my bf. He barely touched my rolls too LMAO this was a very basic order but sushi omigato presented it really well and it tasted so fresh (I stole some to try LMAO)   For apps we ordered the gyoza and it was soo crispy and good! It reminds me of the gyozas from Kinton ramen, which is my favourite place for gyoza!   Service was superb. Our server was very friendly and just the perfect amount of attentive. We didn't feel bombarded or forgotten! She overheard my boyfriend talking about ginger and she actually came by with extra ginger LMAO anddd we ordered two miso soups which she decided to give it to us on the house. I know it's not an expensive item but the gesture is very sweet and priceless. No other a la carte places has offered to do this for us ever when they're considered more on the higher end. When I placed my roll orders she double checked that it was ok to have them on the same plate. Something so small yet it made me feel really taken of and important. I wish I caught her name .. I think it was grace? Or Jessica   If you haven't tried this place, please do! You won't be disappointed. Food is awesome - I'd say comparable to higher end a la carte sushi joints but SUPER AFFORDABLE! Special rolls are approx. ~$12 each with 8 pieces ..!! I'm already looking forward to coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is located in Mississauga Chinatown, and use to be a pho resturant. Me and my bf ordered a set that comes with nigiri, sashimi and maki. Everything was fresh and tasted great. The porportion of rice to fish on the nigiri was good not like ayce places that put too much rice. There was also torched nigiri that had a nice flavour. We couldnt finish everything and had leftover dynamite and green dragon roll. We asked the server we would like to pack it to go and they did it for us. The service here is very nice and friendly. She was very attentive and refilled our teas and checked up on us throughout our meal. I would definitely come here again. A great a la carte place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I made reservations to Sushi Omigoto due to amazing Yelp reviews. Came here to celebrate my friend's Birthday. The restaurant is located in the Chinese City Centre plaza with tones of other restaurants.  The ambiance was nice and cozy. Price wise is on the high end however it's Mississauga it's hard to get good Japanese food. The menu was extensive. It includes Japanese as well as Korean food. I wanted a bento box but it's only offered at lunch time. So we ordered the vegetable gyoza as an appetizer and I ordered the steak teriyaki and it came with a side bowl of rice and my friend ordered the bulgogi beef in a stone pot. My steak was tender and good. The gyoza was crispy and delicious. My friend really liked his bulgogi dish as well.   We talked a lot and was catching up. The service was amazing. The waitresses are so nice and so friendly not once did they rushed us. We were there for over 3 hours! At then  end when I paid my bill I mentioned it was my friends Birthday they brought him a selection of green tea, mango and black sesame ice cream complimentary. Great place! I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's birthday, and honestly, this is probably one of my new favourite sushi places in all of Mississauga!  This location used to be home to a very dated Pho restaurant with grungy decor and noticeable uncleanliness. I'm glad to report that this place now is gorgeous with modern decor and quite an inviting clean atmosphere.   Our server was attentive and we were also greeted by the owners & managers, making the experience very down-to-earth and welcoming.   The food here was beyond expectations! The quality is top-knotch yet the pricing does not break-the-bank; you are getting your money's worth for sure. Dishes had great visual appeal, and the fish was VERY fresh. We ordered a number of sushi and sashimi sets, and plates of udon, which were all very flavourful and delicious. Their black sesame ice cream is also to die for!  I highly recommend this place if you're looking to impress your family and friends, but also are budget-conscious! Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Japanese a la carte restaurant is starting to make a come back. In Mississauga is still a rarety for a good one. There are a couple mom and pa shop but it's not that good. This place however is different. This restaurant is pretty need and it's really presenting the meaning of sushi: fresh and nicely presented. We order 60 pcs of making, sushi and sushimi. The fiah was fresh and nicely presented. The sushi rice was correctly made with apple vinegar and have not cheap out on it.   Keep in mind, it's sushi, as long as it's fresh and it's made looking good, you should get a pretty high review and that's exactly what we have here.  We went onto dessert platter which is 4 different ice cream and a green tea cheese cake. None of it is made in house but again, good quality material were selected and that's what matter.  The price was very good too. $20 per person includes the tip. All we had was the 60 pcs and the dessert. Cash for discount 5% and everyone was walking out full. Can't beat that.  Service was over the top. Keep asking to fill tea and make sure everything was taken care off. Well done   Recommended"}
{"text":"What a great little place in a perfect setting for Sushi.  Like I'm back in Tokyo. The atmosphere is perfect for sushi.  Food is outstanding.   Try the Smokey Roll.  One of the most unique presentations of sushi!  Take a video when it's served!"}
{"text":"So this is my 2nd time to dine at this place and like my previous visit,it didn't disappoint! We got to try 2 new dishes such as the lobster tail and the the Las Vegas dish both very appealing to the palate and has a good aesthetics. For 3 mains dishes we only spent less than $55 which is a steal.Also to make it more exciting,if you pay cash,you get a 5% discount on your entire purchase.Service was also impeccable,I personally am not a fan of spicy taste and they offered the option to change the spicy mayo.They also provided a sample of the spicy mayo so I can taste if it's too spicy or okay for me.All I'm all I'll be back to this resto for my sushi cravings"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Prices are reasonable as well. Amazing restaurant! Highly recommended!  Pay cash for 5% discount!"}
{"text":"This place is in Mississauga Chinatown. It's always nice to find new good sushi places in sauga. I was there with my wife and her sister and we ordered the volcano roll, kalbi, black dragon and the salmon platter. I really enjoyed the volcano roll and the salmon platter. I would come here again for those 2 orders. Our server Grace was wonderful. She was so welcoming and had such a happy aura. I like how she checked up on us and made sure that things were okay. This place is a hit. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"After the great reviews on Yelp I was anxious to try this place out. I really liked the modern decor and when we arrived, and the restaurant had like 3 tables occupied. We were given a table immediately and I noticed that there was only one server around. The server filled our glasses of water, gave us the menu and then walked off. The prices were average. I was a bit disappointed that the sets that seemed the most appealing to me (e.g., the torched sushi) were pretty pricey. I settled for the Omigoto special combo, which consisted of 6 nigiri sushi, half a dynamite roll and half a spicy tuna roll. My brother decided to get the Vege maki set.  I am not a fan of tempura on my sushi so I asked the server to leave out the tempura from mine. We waited for around 20 minutes, during which our water wasn't replaced, we weren't asked if we needed anything else, and we weren't given any appetizer salads or miso soups, which I noticed every other table received.  Our food finally arrived and surprise surprise...my roll was filled with tempura. I immediately called it out and the server just seemed stubborn and seemed reluctant to take it back. When he did, in less than 1 minute he came back with my plate. I noticed that the chef literally replaced the dynamite roll with a California roll. If I wanted a California roll I would have ordered that in the first place. Instead of complaining and making the server even more frustrated than he already was I decided to ignore it. I also noticed that the spicy tuna roll had tempura in it too! While eating we asked the server if he could bring us extra ginger, which he brought once we had completed our meal. I get that he was the only server around, but the restaurant wasn't even that busy. While paying, the server gave a newly arrived couple some salad and also gave them advice as to how to get a better deal in their orders, which was not given to us.  The quality of the sushi was okay, not the best. But the main thing that ruined my experience was not the food but the service.  I will go again to give it another shot and hopefully receive service that is favourable to everyone."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi joint in Mississauga...the pricing is good and the quality is great! The servers always ask when getting a larger sushi tray what we prefer and the chef's always manage cater to what we want! So we don't get a lot of sushi we dislike and get more of the sushi we prefer! For example, we got a sushi platter and preferred salmon so the chef made most of our platter with salmon type of sushi and rolls at no extra cost! We love this place and I come here almost 2-3 times a week. I give this place and the chef my thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time tried this place by placing take out of party trays of sushi combos and sashimi.  Sashimi was freshly prepared and good!  Sushi was pretty good too except al filling are similar with just crab meat and shrimp tempura, wish they made it differently for each rolls.  So second time I decided to dine in on week night with bf.  It wasn't too busy but they had full staffs.  Place were decorated beautifully, greeted by friendly waitresses.  Service was great and foods came out quick.  We ordered couple of torch rolls and seafood champong.  Potion are great and price was very decent.  Look like we found another favourite sushi place!  Will definitely going back again :)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with boyfriend and friend. Ordered the volcano roll, a sushi and maki plate, as well as the mixed tempura appetizer and sashimi appetizer platter.  Everything was delicious. The fish was fresh, the rolls didn't have a lot of rice, and the volcano roll was packed of flavor. Definitely recommended. Price-wise is around average for an a la carte place.  Would come again."}
{"text":"I heard this place is fairly new and had such high ratings!! Thanks Jipooki for the recommendation!! We came by here with a party of 6 ppl Sunday for lunch around 1145 (opens 1130). Interior of the place is impeccable and kinda fancy. As it just opened its doors, it was not busy so we got a table fast. There's Japanese background music playing and 2 tvs playing videos. This restaurant is an alacarte sushi place and offers a wide variety of Korean dishes as well. As always I look through the menu and pick between 1-3 items I wanna try and asked the waitress what she would pick between them.   Amazing service from the moment we walked in and the moment we left. I ordered the spicy chicken hot stone bowl and the Las Vegas roll to share between the table.   Prior to receiving the mains, the hot stone bowls come with miso soup and salad :)  My hot stone bowl sits on top of a bed of rice and comes out sizzling hot! Decently spicy, I mixed the stuff together and there was a perfect amount of spicy sauce to get everything mixed together. Portions were a lot imo so I was full after 3/4 in so I packed that back. The Las Vegas rolls is mainly shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy mayo, cream cheese deep fried with some batter and comes out with fire all around it. Idk why we got it, for the gram maybe? LOL BUT it was actually really good and I recommend this sushi roll. The cream cheese wasn't heavy at all and I liked how it added a bit of sweetness to each bite. Bit hefty on the price for this ($15) but I guess that's the way it is for alacarte dishes.   They have lunch specials that range from 9-14 I think and 2 people got it. Huge portions and worth the price!   I would come back again to try other things. Their menu.. lots of things haha."}
{"text":"SUSHI! Finally a nice place with quality fresh food. The decor is very nice and the prices are rock bottom. Other places would charge almost double. Delicious and recommended."}
{"text":"Considering the interior design and layout of this place, I did not expect such reasonable prices and the amount of food! I was pleasantly surprised since my friend had decided to come here and I didn't really check out reviews prior. It's situated in the south area of the Mississauga Chinese Center on Dundas.  It's really classy and elegant looking inside, I actually wouldnt have been surprised if it was super fancy either. The seats are comfortable, and theres free wifi! It was late, but we were pretty hungry so we ordered a sashimi appetizer, a roll and the omigoto combo special. Each item was ~$12. The appetizer would have been enough for either one of us alone as a meal (w/ a side of rice). The sashimi slices were thick and tasted fresh. We were surprised because we also weren't expecting the presentation so be so nice! My friend really enjoyed the roll she had as well. The Omigoto combo was also very well priced, 15 pieces for $13. Pieces were large, and tasted good, no dry sushi here! We didn't finish it all, and I actually took the rest home and had it the next day. Besides the rice being a bit harder (no surprise there, since it was in the fridge) everything still tasted amazing!! I really enjoyed this place, and I will definitely bring more family and friends here to grab sushi. I usually go downtown for sushi since I wasn't aware that Missisauga had decent sushi places, but I was wrong."}
