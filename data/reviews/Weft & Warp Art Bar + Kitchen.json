{"text":"I like this place. It needs a little help with basic restaurant etiquette such as service speed and customer awareness but it has a nice atmosphere. The food prep is good and it caters to a more healthier audience with a more artistic flare. My wife and I enjoyed our brunch overlooking the pool. Server was very friendly and funny. Since it's new, the place is immaculate.  Worth a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it was so disappointing. To start with a giant roach crawled in the main door from the pool. Ok...it's AZ. It went unnoticed by the staff until finally a patron got up and stomped it. The bad part is that various staff walked by it at least 40 times and no one dealt with it.  New customers were definitely noticing it. Finally what I assume was a manager noticed it and kind of leisurely removed it. I would have thought heads would roll, but I don't think it caused a stir. Not a good thing to see in a place you're about to eat. The service was slow, cups were never brought with our tea setups. After about 10 minutes I got up to fetch them. My side of fruit was forgotten. The eggs were cooked very well but the rest... just eh. I think everyone could do much better here. The staff was nice enough, but very lackadaisical. It seems like some good training and oversight would help things. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Altho I am a fan of this new restaurant and have had brunch and dinner there, they need to re adjust a few things.  It is not very large and is intimate,   I do like the menu and had their trout which was excellent.  All the food is well prepared and presented, but the appetizers are very small and not easy to share and the waite staff does their best to please altho can be a bit slow. Warning on the bar and the bar prices.  This is where they fall short and really need to improve. Paying $24.00 for a Grey Goose martini was very steep and very weak, a second attempt was not improved on and their signature cocktails, were also on the weak side.  So much for trendy drinks.  We really like this new and modern restaurant in the valley which is attached to the new Andaz hotel, but may not consider it a go to until some of their pricing and portions gets adjusted."}
{"text":"I would like to say that I appreciate the manager for making sure our meal was enjoyable and that we were taken care of! We wanted to switch tables to outside and he was very understanding and responsive to our needs. We came to Andaz for my best friends 21st birthday and it was very worth it! Thank you"}
{"text":"Terrible.  The menu is very limited, as I understand being in the culinary industry it's to incorporate the small number of ingredients into each-other, but still not what I was looking for on this day so this is a personal opinion. Pretty pricey but it's the appearance and presentation you are paying for.  Nothing really wow'd me.. except the coffee, which was really good.  The resort is very nice and this restaurant I would really only recommend for drinks.  There is so many great spots in Scottsdale to dine, just not this one."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place. They have an amazing selection of wines and craft cocktails. Its even great because the servers have thorough knowledge of their selections which is great for someone like me who doesn't drink often and is afraid to try new drinks.   The menu here is exquisite. They use a lot of familiar ingredients but take everything to a whole new level of deliciousness. One of my personal favorites is their lamb belly: lamb belly, butter lettuce sauce, and olive salad with oranges, parsley and some other herbs. I really enjoy their trout as well, its served skin on, with a romesco sauce, cauliflower, arugula and a grilled lemon. It sounds so simple but it has an incredible amount of flavor! The desserts are to die for as well. I suggest trying their Sticky toffee date cake. So moist and rich without being overbearing.  I would recommend this place to everyone! It is tucked behind busy Scottsdale Road its as if it is in its own secluded island."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! A great place to enjoy a craft cocktail or a nice bottle of wine. Beautiful view of camelback mountain. Right off Scottsdale road but hidden away from the traffic. A great getaway from the hustle of daily life."}
{"text":"This was our first visit... dinner was excellent! The trout was cooked to perfection ... our server was Robin, she was very knowledgeable about the menu, made some nice suggestions, the wine Rubicon 2012 was not only amazing but autographed by the wine maker!!!"}
{"text":"Very well done.  Nice addition to the Scottsdale dining scene.  Interesting menu and fresh food selections.  Nice atmosphere with modern flair.  Robin provided outstanding service.  Everything done to perfection.  Definately will be back."}
{"text":"While staying at the hotel we dined at the restaurant twice for breakfast and one night for drinks and appetizers.  The food is incredible, the staff very friendly and happy hour excellent.  The breakfast menu offers many choices and the food is not only beautiful, but delicious.  The happy hour menu is well worth it.  You have quite a few choices and the food offered again is interesting, upscale and scrumptious.  One morning for breakfast, we had avocado toast.  The bread comes from a local bakery, topped with creamy avocado, a perfectly cooked egg.  The next morning, Mr. Bee had their version of Eggs Benedict.  Blue Corn pancakes topped with poached eggs and a southwestern style sauce.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and both were incredible.  The blue corn pancakes are light, rustic and nutty.  The Huevos Rancheros was 3 crunchy tortillas, homemade sauce and perfectly scrambled eggs with cheese.  If I could have licked my plate I would have, absolutely delicious.  For happy hour one night we sat on the patio overlooking the pool, watching the sunset and enjoying our drinks.  Our mixologist made Mr. Bee a drink similar to a Sazerac, but she smoked the glass with applewood chips and then mixed the drink and added it to the glass.  You certainly got a nice smoky flavor to the drink.  If staying at the hotel or in the area, this is a great spot to eat.    If you are at the hotel for business and need some work time during the day, they have thought of everything.  The seats at the bar have electric plugs underneath to charge a phone or computer, several of the the booths have outlets to plug in a computer making it very convenient to sit and work.  The restaurant is open, airy, modern and comfortable.  When staying at the hotel, you will find that breakfast is served until 3 pm.  I love that.  You don't have to get up and rush over to eat."}
{"text":"WEFT & WARP-- Oh, how we LOVE it here. Great food...healthy, sustainable, awesome! Love the Grilled Squash and Arugula Salad, so much goodness. They don't skimp on healthy. And ALL sides are so good as well. Especially love the Mushroom Crown and Blistered Shishito Peppers. Great service...Mike is an awesome bartender, very knowledgable. Always serves a good, well balanced drink. Makes a great Pisco Sour which is always my fav. Kimber is a multitasker...she does it all! We see her all over the restaurant making sure everyone is cared for. No one works harder or faster than Kimber! An asset to Andaz for sure. We always look forward to going back. Please don't change. Stay awesome Weft & Warp!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday so I got to pick a new place to try for Happy Hour.  So glad I decided to try W&W!  Such a wonderful, open and inspiring space and so relaxing.  The service was excellent!  Friendly, not at all overbearing, knowledgeable- and the food and drinks were great too.  Tried the bone marrow special - interesting - a little salty but good.  Good wine selection.  Will be going back soon to try the cocktails!  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, they need to do something about the sun streaming in from the Western sky.  Robin or Rachel (sorry don't remember her name) was awesome.  Food was good but salty.  I was damn thirsty all night long.  Food was very good, but they have a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, very boring, food was actually NOT good (grissly & fatty NY Strip covered in some sort of gross brown gravy, zero flavor and cold).  Ambiance is similar to a new Denny's.  Looks like it is probably the all day dining restaurant, so no real ambiance.  Wait staff was good, and attentive, however they have a station where they put the cleared plates and it was right in front of us, which kind of grossed us out seeing dirty dishes stacked until they got taken away.  Presentation was boring, the menu is very limited and doesn't have anything on it that looked good (which is why I thought I would be safe with the NY Strip.....wrong!).  Couldn't wait to finish and leave, will not return and wouldn't recommend.  Wine list is extremely limited with selections I had never heard of, looked like it was almost an after thought to have a wine list.  The interior of the restaurant is just not anything special at all.  I think they should just market this place as somewhere the hotel guests can get breakfast and lunch and maybe close for dinner"}
{"text":"I literally have never been to a worse restaurant. The food was less than mediocre and the service was literally atrocious. Let's start from the beginning.  There was no signage when we walked in that indicated whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, so after standing at the counter with not even so much as a glance from the 4 servers behind the bar, we assumed it was seat yourself. We sat, then 5 minutes later after no one had come to greet us, we saw some others come in and get seated, so we went back up to the front and told them we had seated ourselves so they gave us some menus. 10 minutes later a server finally came to our table, I put in an order for sparkling water, so he went to get it. 5 minutes later still no sparkling water, and the manager had to come to our table to refill our waters and take our orders.   Here's the best part. It took a whopping 45 minutes for us to receive chilaquiles and a Belgian waffle. When we asked about 35 minutes in where our food was, they told us \"the kitchen is just really backed up, it'll be out soon.\" There were 4 cooks in the kitchen for a total of 8 full tables at the restaurant... not so sure about the math here. OH, and there were also 8 servers in the restaurant for those 8 tables along with 2 managers. They were, in my opinion, over-staffed, and still couldn't figure out how to be efficient.  When we finally received our food, it was literally some of the worst food I've ever had. Firstly, don't order the Belgian waffle expecting a nice, big fluffy helping. It is about 2cm thick and resembles a cracker more than a waffle. This is not an exaggeration. Oh and it was $16, cool. Second, have you ever had chilaquiles with literally no meat? So just an egg, some salsa, and a couple of tortillas? Well if not, you'll find that here.  At the end, after waiting for almost an hour, getting some of the worst service I could fathom, and not even an acknowledgement or apology from one of the two managers, we were comped ONE drink from our entire meal. Even with that comped drink AND the 10% off check in offer, our bill was $50. Do not ever come here. It's literally a joke of a restaurant. I would have given them a pass since theyre pretty recently open, but opening day jitters should have been gone a long time ago. They've been open for like 3-4 months...  Don't mess with a woman when she's pregnant and starving."}
{"text":"Decided to try the chef's experience in the \"glass room\" for my mother's birthday. The whole experience was sublime! Great kitchen and dining room atmosphere, amazing staff, and the food was original and delicious! I normally don't take the time to write reviews however the Weft and Warp really took care of us and made this an awesome birthday dinner! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Great food, outstanding service. I mentioned to the waiter hat my friend had the better drink and he switched mine! The ginger in the drink was to die for. So was the desert. Very creative, fresh food."}
{"text":"Horrible. Made reservations for a table for two well in advance of Valentines Day then they called me two days before to let me know that there isn't a full menu (only cocktails and appetizers) and there's only open seating. What's the point of taking reservations if you're not going to honor them?! Never eaten here and probably never will."}
{"text":"Such a cool tucked away spot with great food! Pricey but we knew that going in. Server was so sweet and present."}
{"text":"Staying at the resort we wanted to dine in.  The atmosphere is a 5, very cool place and loved the look.  Staff was very friendly. I would rate them a 4.5  Food and service was about a 1 this evening along with the value.  Food- we started with an appetizer which was tasty  - the elotes - salad  The service- this took about 20 minutes for these two items to come out. Kind of hitting the outer limits of timing for me.  Entrees  Our table ordered the following for entrees - Buttercrunch salad -Bowl of soup - trout dish  We ordered shishito peppers as an appetizer but it came out with the entrees.  The above items took almost another 50 minutes to come out. We asked 3 times when will it be ready. Keep in mind the place is less than a quarter full.  In addition the portion sizes for the food was crazy small. - the soup was roughly 5 spoonfuls for 9 dollars -buttercrunch salad about a small soup bowl for 12 bucks - trout entree was fine but came out cold  Sorry but I didn't sign up for a slow tiny meal. Really love the hotel but the staff was either understaffed because everything was super slow and not attentive. Not even a single acknowledgement that things were off or slow."}
{"text":"This is my second time and like the first time, delivered on every level.  The staff was professional and very knowledgeable about the food and craft cocktails.  The chef continues to raise the bar."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place a lot but I didn't. Tucked away behind the Borgata, you'll find the Andaz resort, where this restaurant is located.   The restaurant's glass walls allows you to see the sun, parts of the resort and also the sunset. If it's an hour before sunset, don't sit at the tables next to the glass wall where the sun shines in. The heat and the sun in your face will just make you uncomfortable until the sun finally sets.   I originally started at the bar while I waited for my friend her and her group to show up. Happy hour ends at 6 so I managed to get some drinks and the sliders on the HH menu. The pimm's cup cocktail was crafted nicely and I ordered one for the birthday girl as well since she was arriving just as HH was ending.   Once we were seated by the hostess, it took quite a while before we had a server. It would be safe to say it was 10-15 minutes before we stopped someone and asked for a server.   The sliders were yummy and I'm sad to say this but it was probably the best item I ate there. It's not available on their regular menu. We ordered 2 of the blue cornbread with tomato jalapeño jam (c'mon, it was just a fancier way of saying salsa). We ordered 2 because they're so dang small. I think one cornbread could be 6 bites, but only 4 bites if you take large bites. I was shocked because it was $6 for one.   We also got the goat cheese dumplings and an order of the lamb belly off the \"bits and bites\" portion of the menu. It is literally just bits and a few bites. Nothing stood out.   So if you decide to visit this place, come for the drinks (which are a bit overpriced) but don't come with an appetite."}
{"text":"Instant favorite. Restaurant has the right balance of location, setting, food, service etc. Before dinner we relaxed at the bar and enjoyed a mercury mirage. Menu is superb and the wine list is appealing. When in Scottsdale this place is a must."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ruined our stay. I tried to write a detailed review, but it was too long, yelp said. Cockroaches, bad service, management didn't care - long story short."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour.  Service was a bit slow at the table but otherwise an interesting spot due to it being at the Andaz hotel."}
{"text":"Had happy hour today. Nice space but must be ran by corporate. Staff appropriate and attentive. Menu for happy hour limiting. They must not be interested in growth or making money. Go look at the competition. If I was staying there I also would hunt for a more lively place. Could be a gold mine with people. It must not be their priority.The renovation was great. Simple happy hour Martini and margarita would be a start. Then maybe more aggressive gourmet happy hour menu with attractive prices. This night did not make me wish to return soon."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was fantastic.  We sat at The Kitchen Table which is a glass-box, plancha-style kitchen, The Kitchen Table offers up to 10 guests the chance to watch the chef cook and prepare the meals.  We tried a lot of things including Dates, Blue Cornbread, Braised Lamb Belly, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Gem Salad, Bone In Kurobota Pork Chop, Roasted Pee Wee Potatoes, Blueberry Crumb Cake, and the wonderful Blue Corn Short Stack.  All the things listed were amazing both in how cooked and the flavors used.  If you like cocktails and trying new things order the Mercury Mirage with is a delight."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. They had very small plates. I had the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had an omelette with literally nothing inside. With lots of servers it's weird I didn't even get offered a refill of coffee until the waitress came to bring the check. With the price you pay and the amount of servers I hope you could expect at least that. There were lots of windows and had views to the pool which made it nice."}
{"text":"We were so excited for the Andaz Scottsdale to open and to check out this cool new place to enjoy drinks or a casual meal.  The restaurant is bright, airy and super laid back.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks...a nice, refreshing glass of Sauvignon Blanc for me and the bartender even let me try a taste of an unoaked Chardonnay - nice touch!  We'll definitely come back to enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner on our next visit."}
{"text":"Poor service! I ordered a drink that I found disgusting and only had one sip. The server never checked in and dropped a check right next to an untouched drink. $15 for one sip and poor service? This is NOT at an Andaz level. I am a disappointed patron who is quite loyal to Hyatt. This bar is not at Hyatt standards. Locals, pass. Guests, lower your service expectations and check out Blanco down the drive."}
{"text":"If you don't care about service or food the atmosphere is good! However if you actually expect any form of decent food or service definitely go somewhere else. From start to finish including a rude antagonizing manger, average service for the food prices and barely edible food It was definitely the worst $200 ever spent. From beginning to end if I wrote out everything wrong with this dining experience It would be pages long and no one has time for that. So to keep it short; lesson learned, do not eat at hotel next time make reservations somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Unfortunately, the server seemed confused about the plan for our large group and misrepresented the order process.  Would try again in a smaller party as food was amazing and I think this is a great place, beautiful location and great place to celebrate a special evening."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel for a few days and I was impressed by this little kitchen every morning. Fresh grapefruit juice and customized omelette just added a sense of happiness when you discovered the different layers of flavors brought by the spices and the right amount of seasoning embedded in the dish. The avo toast was heaven. Please definitely try their house made sauces. It's a pity that they don't sell those at retail.   Went bk for a light dinner the other day. Their mushroom soup blew my mind with the sophisticated umani flavors by different mushrooms  all blended into the soup. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Modern space in an upscale boutique hotel. An obscure location behind the now torn-down Borgata. Apps are not worth exploring. However, main courses such as whole Trout and the Cornish Hen are delicious. Service is somewhat scattered, but the effort is there. Free valet parking.  We went back recently and it did not meet expectations. First thing that should upset anyone is a glass of Rose( a small amount not in a carafe) is $17. The trout was dry and the Scallops were rubbery. It seems like kids are doing the cooking. It's an open kitchen and they look like they are 16. Limited menu with some strange items. I wonder if these so called name chefs are ever in the kitchen making your meal."}
{"text":"Pretentious with no substance and painfully slow service.  A drink came out up when ordered on the rocks and a salad came fully dressed when asked for the dressing on the side.  Amateur-hour mistakes that weren't even followed by apologies.  Limited, boring menu.  At least step up the service to try to justify the pricing.  Way too many good options nearby to waste time and money on this place again."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant and kitchen!  The place is close to a Vegas style modern hotel!  I came here with my friend and we were lucky enough to sit at their patio area with an overview of the pool while enjoy the nice warm Phoenix evening.    We started off with some drinks to wet our palates.  My friend ordered a red wine and I went for their Mercury Mirage; applewood smoked infused rye whiskey with maple and chili bitters.  I like mines neat, but if you didn't like whiskey you would have loved this drink regardless!  For our food we started with the Braised Lamb Belly; which didn't come out cause our server forgot to put it in.  However, for our entree I ordered their Grilled Flank Steak and my friend went for the Trout.  My steak was done a little over from what I ordered.  The beer and onion puree was sweet with a minor hint of the beer; great sauce!  The EVOO or extra virgin olive oil croutons was cool and definitely gave the dish some needed texture.  My friends fish was grilled and flakey.  To be honest I thought it was quite bland.  Finally, when our lamb came out we were somewhat full by then, but had to try it!  I was disappointed unfortunately since I found it fatty and gelatinous again lacking in flavors.  In the end, the place was soooooo beautiful and I really wanted to give my thumbs up with 5 stars.  However, our service was slow and while we waited our service came and gave us some Ostrich jerky and almonds.  Food was decent but beautiful and whimsical.  I would probably come back for drinks just to hangout! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chef Adam is doing a great job here elevating the menu from a traditional boring resort menu to a bonafide dining destination.  The contemporary, open dining room is a great setting and the service is always fast and friendly.  Some of my favorite dishes have been the blistered shishito peppers, braised lamb belly and the bone-in pork shank.  They also have a nice selection of craft beer, wine and craft cocktails.  Overall, W&W is a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away within the Andaz Resort, which is also tucked away from the main road. Signage for the restaurant is subtle so you may have to look up from your phone to find it :)   The restaurant has a very open, trendy, cozy atmosphere. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls create a very exposed and airy ambiance. The kitchen is also enclosed in a similar set up; it's enclosed, yet open. They have indoor and outdoor seating in both a traditional dining and a lounge setting. Noise level is on the quieter end, and I think it amazing, especially after a long day at work. The back-patio seating faces the pool with Camelback Mountain in the backdrop. It's quite a view.   Service was good. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress, Molly, was very quick and helpful. The food came out relatively quickly but also the restaurant was mostly empty. We came here for dinner on a weekday and had a reservation, but I do not think you'll need a reservation if you visit it on a weekday evening.   The menu items are intended to be shared amongst the table so the appetizers are served tapas style and all the entree items, which are called \"for the table,\" were cut into sharable pieces. For appetizers, we ordered the dates and goat cheese dumplings. For dinner, we shared the NY strip steak with a side of shishito peppers. I have to commend them for the great job they've done creating a menu full of distinct items, their use of ingredients, and their presentation of the food. However, all of the dishes we ordered were too sweet. I felt the dates were more appropriate for dessert, and the ny strip steak had a sweet glaze on it and was surrounded by a black garlic glaze, also sweet. The goat cheese dumplings lacked flavor and the accompanying marinated spaghetti squash was again, sweet. Maybe it was the dishes we chose, but I would have liked to see more diverse flavors from one plate to the next.  The facility is very clean and well maintained. If anyone cares, they have gender neutral bathrooms. I am a fan of bathroom setups like this."}
{"text":"Super disappointed unfortunately. Great vibe, ambiance perfected but the food was ok. Our waiter messed up our order and bright out the wrong dish to start with. When we asked him what happened he apologized but didn't want to switch what he ordered. He asked us if we still wanted it. Of course we wanted it, we ordered it but he didn't bring it after all. Moving on, all our food including 2 appetizers and aside order came out at the same time as our main course. We ordered two drinks and he didn't have the ingredients for one but made up something else that was too spicy and just ok. Then he offered to bring dessert to compensate the mistake of the 1st course, and there was hair in our tart. The minute I put the spoon through to feed my husband the 1st bite, a piece of hair was intermingled inside. Not a fun way to end a meal.  Food was interesting but not coming back. That was a pretty disappointing evening."}
{"text":"First - do yourself a favor and ask for Aaron. He is a local and knows all the Sweet spots. He is also awesome.   When we stayed there, over thanksgiving, Aaron made all the difference in our stay. Told us what to do, where to go and what to see.   Second - the food here is outright good. You will not be disappointed.   Last - go easy on the Coffee. It's highly caffeinated. :)"}
{"text":"When I first arrived, I was amazed by how beautiful the restaurant is! It's modern and interesting, with a slight mid-century to 1970s throw-back look. I loved it! It's designed to look like one's own home living space, and trust me, I wish mine really looked like this. However, dinning experience and food failed to live up to the decor.    We had an 8 pm reservation for two, and when we arrived, our table was not ready, so they had us take a seat at the bar. After a drink, they moved us to a table. Our table was next to the bar and had been open the entire time, set and ready to go. We were confused; was this just to get us a to buy a drink at the bar? Were they hoping we would decide to eat at the bar instead, forfeiting our table?  Once at our table, we ordered the blue cornbread from the \"bits and bites\" and it was bland and extremely small. We also ordered the watermelon with crispy chicken skin, which I didn't care for, and a couple of the dates, which I enjoyed! All of these items were truly bite sized, as the menu states, which means for a party of two, we each had one, maybe two bites. From the \"form the table\" section, we ordered the whole roasted game hen to split between the two of us.  It was tiny. I would have found it to be a small portion size just for one, let alone a dish that was labeled as being \"for the table.\" We also ordered the grilled broccoli as a companion. The hen and broccoli were both tasty.  Our server left a lot to be desired. She was scattered. She was unsure if they had certain items in stock that were on the menu. She reference items on the bar menu that we could order, but then wouldn't bring us a copy of this menu. She told us twice about how you can taste the orange blossoms in the potatoes from the local bees that pollinated them. This came of pretentious, but comical. When I accepted her offer to bring another glass of wine, she filled up my glass only to the normal point, when I already had least a quarter of my existing wine left in the glass. She must have heard us complaining because she took two drinks off our bill. I appreciated this!  We left hungry and little bit annoyed. We went to another restaurant, ordered some food and a few more drinks. If I came back, it would just be just to get a drink, enjoy their beautiful decor, and watch the sunset at the resort."}
{"text":"A very classy gem hidden in the heart of Scottsdale. Theirs is a simple, delicious menu in a casual atmosphere with plenty of sparkle. Romantic, cool, sexy..."}
{"text":"Beautiful bar and restaurant tucked away off Scottsdale road. The Kobe beef sliders for happy hour were excellent..One order can easily be shared by two. The environment with the open kitchen is just stunning. If you want a special dining experience, go there as the sun sets, then walk around the beautiful resort grounds."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Andaz Scottsdale recently and ate multiple times at Weft and Warp. We had a wonderful experience each time. We did not find one thing we didn't like there between both the breakfast and dinner menu. If I had to suggest one item on the dinner menu it would be Crow's Dairy Goat Cheese Dumplings... oh my word. If I could order it right now and have it shipped to Denver I would! The elote was also a great starter and if you're a meat lover try the venison loin.  It was cooked to perfection! Check out the cocktail menu as well, although pricey the drinks are quite satisfying. The service is great with kind, knowledgeable waiters. Truly, you can't go wrong at this wonderful new restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was on our list of new restaurants to try.  Came in for lunch one day and were pleasantly surprised that they serve breakfast till 2:00.  Great concept: no need to wait for brunch till Sunday!  While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive we started at the bar counter with apricot scone and kouign amman (never had anything this good before!) and mushroom crown that was too beautifully presented to cut into and just as good to eat.  Then, moved outside to the patio overlooking the pool, tall palm trees and the mountain. Absolute paradise!  Very helpful staff; there when we needed them w/o being rushed to enjoy the setting.  Food was excellent.  We had chicken with waffles that had a sophisticated twist on southern staple, avocado toast - local bread with smashed avocado and runny eggs - simple and elegant on the same plate, dirty hash brown served with green chilly puree and braised pork and lastly chia seeds pudding with fresh berries and granola that sounds too healthy to be good yet was so delicious we almost licked the bowl.  My husband and sons kept trying different drinks from the bar that the bartender was very helpful in going over in some details but since I don't drink I tuned that out.  I was happily focused on the food that I tried from everyone's plate. Can't wait to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"BLUE CORN SHORT STACK! Come on! What a breakfast. The poppyseed pancakes with lemon custard and \"boozy\" syrup are unreal. Ate breakfast here 3D during our stay at Andaz, and I definitely repeated the same breakfast twice. I'd recommend adding chicken sausage on the side. Perfectly complimentary protein and plenty to fill a hungry man (or woman) right up."}
{"text":"If we can discuss our experience in three words, it would be 1) intrigued 2) disappointed 3) amazed. I guess it's like a love story, you have to experience the low to feel the high. Ha!  Intrigued: We stopped in to have dinner on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was gorgeous, modern, and a perfect addition to the Andaz hotel. You can't help but expect the food to be as beautiful/delicious as the place itself.   Disappointed: We immediately ordered dates, yellowtail, cornbread, and two grilled steak hangars. The dates and yellowtail were first to arrive. The dates were fair but the yellowtail smelled fishy. Yes, yes it's a fish but it's \"fishy\" in a spoiled kind of way.  After experiencing that, we told our waiter of the issue and that we'd prefer to cancel the rest of our meal.   Amazed: With no hesitation, our waiter apologize and left with the plate. Soon after, Mike, the manager stopped by and asked what was wrong and how he could make our experience better. Mike then proceeded to explain that the yellowtail was a new dish. He then offered to comp our entire meal and drinks as a way to improve our experience. It was very generous of him and goes to show the care he had to ensure we left the establishment satisfied. We decided to stay and finish our meal.   The hangar steak was AMAZING and the drinks were SUBLIME! We were taken aback. The combination of puréed eggplant, tomatoes, and charred steak paired so well together. It was an explosion of flavors. A MUST for anyone who decides to visit. And let me tell you about the drinks, we tried the Pimm's Cup and El Diablo, both very well crafted. Worth every penny. We'll be back for those.   Mike truly took great care of us. He asked for feedback and seem to genuinely took them into consideration. Weft & Warp is lucky to have him.   GO! We recommend visiting during sunset hours. It's beautiful. Order a drink or two...or three and go straight for the steak. Skip the yellowtail, dates, and cornbread.   Cheers! You're welcome!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Andaz and were offered complimentary breakfast. My husband and I sampled their menus for two of the days.   We were really put off by the hostess on our first day. We were initially seated in the back corner by the kitchen while everyone else was in the front. There were plenty of empty tables nearby and we politely asked to move. The hostess rolled her eyes and told us it would take time. When we inquired how long it would take - since they were all empty and set up already - she told us \"I don't know, at least 10 mins\", dumped the menu on the table, and left. Thankfully the manager happened to walk by and saw us standing and confused - he immediately walked us over to another table. Not sure what was her issue. Girl with dirty blonde  - hair pulled back/bun? - needs more training (a lot more).   Thankfully the food made up for the first impression. Blue corn short stacks, Benjamin, chilaquile, Belgian waffles, dirty hash, bond burger, and lavender caramelized croissant were all individually unique, beautifully crafted, and scrumptious to the last bite. The pancakes were perfectly sweetened and my husband couldn't leave without having a full order to himself on the last day. Cheers to their genius interpretation of eggs Benedict = savory corn pancake and huge ham steak. Def can't skip on their Belgian waffles with the bonbon syrup and house made vanilla creme- personally my fav! And who can forget the croissant - lavender infused in every bite - Wished I could bring a whole basket home with me!   Overall - foods were delicious and menu was innovative (lots of yummy, interesting options to choose from). However, service (aside from the hostess) seemed a little off and scattered. Not one would expect from a $$$$ resort restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the Andaz spa and resort and overlooks the beautiful pool area. There is ample outdoor seating available, however, we chose to dine indoors as the evening was a bit chilly. I love the creativity of both the space and the menu! The infusion of art in visible in every detail, from walking in and being handed coloring pencils and an array of adult coloring books, to the details in the serving dishes and of most importantly the beautiful and yummy combinations of flavors and colors in our meal. We chose to share a few small bites which included the pistachio encrusted dates, the jalapeño corn bread and the goat cheese dumplings. These were yummy and had such an amazing flavor palate. For our main dish we ordered the mushroom soup (soooo yummy) and the risotto (best risotto I've ever had with crunchy bites of quinoa and long grain rice that packed every bite with so much flavor).  We shared the apricot horchata dessert which was such a unique pairing of flavors and had subtle hints of white chocolate, spicy cinnamon and tart apricot packing some rich flavors into every morsels...the gold flakes on top made it a beautiful treat. All of the cocktails are delicious and service is wonderful, I'll definitely be back. This is a great spot for a date, a business meeting or even a solo meal. Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Located in the center of the new Andaz resort and spa, this place is a desert gem!   Executive Chef Adam has done an incredible job creating an eclectic menu suitable for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   Highly recommend to visitors to Arizona, or locals in the area; definitely a must try/see sort of place."}
{"text":"Stay at the Hyatt Andaz Resort for work for 3 nights.  The 1st night I wanted to try the hotel restaurant.  I was dining alone and the hostess suggested siting me at one of the lounge tables.  I don't understand the design of these tables since they are like 3/4 tall.  It is hard to eat at that height which is a strange design for an almost fine dining restaurant.  Dining in Phoenix for dinner tends to be late around 8 pm for all since the temps are so hot.  I felt my waiter was giving me a look for not ordering drinks or an entrée.  I just ordered lite bites. I can understand when my food arrived.  The portions are not proportional the dates and goat cheese dumplings were small bites and the side of potatoes were huge.  I even to go almost half the potatoes.  The food was tasty."}
{"text":"The food was so-so, the wine list was small and the bottles were overpriced. There were so many other restaurants available within walking distance of the Andaz resort."}
{"text":"Robin was incredible, we loved her accurate and rich descriptions of the delicious menu. The wine and local flavor made this restaurant a must. We live nearby and will be back."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Andaz and decided to try dinner here.  Atmosphere was very cool but dinner choices are mediocre at best.  We are not picky eaters and felt the choices were very limited.  No fish other than whole trout and no real kids options.  Ended up just ordering side items.  Drink prices were ridiculous- $24 for a martini.  If they hope to stay open definitely need to expand their menu."}
{"text":"Wow! We're vacationing in AZ and stopped in on a whim here. I really enjoyed the view of the mountains, the lovely scenic hotel and the killer drunk menu. My husband especially enjoyed the adult coloring books...haha!"}
{"text":"Kimber did a fantastic job of taking care of us. She was prompt and friendly. Daniel was very attentive and personable as well. Great tie. Jake(?) the manager sent us a glass of champagne gratis and indulged us with an assortment of menu items like the cornbread and elote which we enjoyed so much we barely had room for the entrees. All said and done a great experience, wonderful ambiance and we will certainly be returning soon."}
{"text":"This brand new resturant was uniquely spectacular. The menu was very creative and excellent for sharing with our friends and family. The staff was phenomenal, very knowledgeable about the concept of the resturant and the flavors on the menu. The resturant boasted a modern aclectic vibe, with a mixology driven bar as a focal point. I am very excited to return."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Andaz resort and ate at the restaurant twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast.   First for breakfast, we were able to eat outside in the sun, facing the pool which was really nice. It was gorgeous! We quickly ordered a coffee and orange juice. One thing to note here, is that their ceramic mugs were so pretty haha. We ended up ordering the dirty hash and the belgian waffles.   The dirty hash was awesome, no complaints there. It was beautiful, tasty, and different. But the belgian waffles were the clear winner! We literally almost ordered a second plate, they were so good! They were perfectly crispy and topped with a dollop of homemade whipped cream that basically tasted like ice cream..! They were literally so amazing, I wish I lived closer so I could have them more often. I actually just ordered a waffle maker so I could try to recreate them at home..  For dinner, we hung out on the patio again during happy hour. We had a late checkout, 4pm, and our flight wasnt until 8pm. So we sat on the couch for a few hours. There was live music playing, and the couple was amazing! We ordered the waygu beef sliders and bruschetta (grilled wildflower bread is what its called on the menu), and some drinks. They were all delicious. No complaints here. I wanted something a bit more substantial for dinner, so I ordered a plate off of the dinner menu instead of the happy hour menu.   I ordered the whole roasted game hen with adobo mop sauce, avocado, lemon, pistachio, cilantro. It was so so yummy, the adobo sauce was so interesting. And the chicken literally sat on a bed of avocado haha. This is probably something that is supposed to be shared and ordered with sides, but since we already had the bruschetta earlier, I figured it would be fine alone. And it was. But if you're coming here for dinner, I'd just note that the style is more like mains and sides are separate, so that can be a little pricy.   Overall we LOVED dining here. The atmosphere was just so nice, and the indoor outdoor space is really awesome. We watched the sunset in the evening by the fire while drinking a glass of wine, in February... I mean it doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"I found this a very cool place, but it's happy hour was not great. The selection was limited and pricey, but I get it, it's a hotel and exclusive clientele is needed to keep it from turning into the Valley Ho. The menu was not memorable, but I'm sure things will change. The gift shop is incredible, we purchased several felt dolls that make us smile, so we will be back to have one glass of wine and an order of potato chips just to experience the cozy modern atmosphere. Can't wait until the plants mature in 3 years, they did a great job landscaping, oh and the bathroom is groovy as well."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Food is great with a wide variety. Drinks were amazing. It's a little expensive and the portions are tiny. Recommend getting multiple dishes. The waitress, Robin, was very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast I've ever had. The chia pudding was awesome. The waffles were amazing. The real star of the show was the lavender almond tea. The lavender had an amazing calming effect while being refreshing. There was a beautiful view of camelback mountain. The staff was friendly, informative, and awesome."}
{"text":"Ask for robin !!! She was very helpful, and attentive, also the atmosphere is amazing they got the whole Beverly Hills vibe goin on. Went to eat dinner and wanted to stay at the resort after, hopefully they do local deals in the summer!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened a couple weeks ago. Although there were only a couple reviews, it was highly rated so I really wanted to check it out.   On the day of my reservation, it was really dark with little to none street lights and there were a lot of construction going on. I am not sure if there's any free parking around but it was raining that night so I just valet my car.   I was surprised that it was empty when I walked in 7PM on a Friday night. There was one other table. It seemed a little overstaffed as there was a group of servers gathered around the bar. With that being said, service was great - server was attentive and there was always someone refilling the water glasses.   I ordered the braised lamb belly (4/5), pork belly (6/5 - yes it was that good), & lemon-evoo marinated eggplant (3/5). For drinks, I ordered the Mercury Mirage (3/5) and the Diamondback fizz (3/5).   I don't think I would come back but if I did, it'll definitely be for the view and the pork belly."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for brunch, and again they didn't disappoint. The menu reads a little unusual from the standards, but the food is delicious, and they are happy to accommodate individual requests. The staff is friendly and helpful, but not invasive. The vibe is really cool, and reminds me of Palm Springs with that mid century modern aesthetic.   For those looking for a really great bar, they have an extensive craft cocktail menu, and the house made jerky is not to be missed. I can't wait for an opportunity to do a staycation, as the bungalows and pool look so appealing!"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast because the place had good reviews. I don't know what happened but this place was terrible. There was only 6 other customers inside and it took an hour to get breakfast. Everyone from the hostess to the cook did a terrible job. 20 minutes just to get coffee! When the food came the omelet was burnt, the hash brown were old and Luke warm, and the salad only had oil for dressing.  A simple Breakfast for 2 was $58 !!!! Oh and a roach walked in while we were waiting. At least he had enough sense to leave."}
