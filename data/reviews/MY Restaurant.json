{"text":"Fam time !! Yummy food :)  Ordered a lot of traditional Chinese dishes.  Will be back to try breakfast / lunch !"}
{"text":"Wonderful food that makes you feel at home! The soups were a wonderful start, especially for a cold wintry day like today. We had General Tao Chicken, which was a perfect balance of sweet and sour, neither of which overpowered the flavors. The batter wasn't too thick (like other eateries usually make them), so we knew their chef truly cared about the quality of the food that is served. The lamb belly was also very good: the meat was soft, and the flavors not too salty..moist and great with rice."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a great spot to check out if you're looking for authentic Asian food in the Markham Rd and Hwy 7 area. The ladies who work here are really sweet and they have a wide selection on their menu. Although I can't say that every dish here that we tried was super amazing (probably ordered stuff that wasn't their specialty as their menu is huge) but my husband and I like to come back for the good service, super adorable menu and their tasty (*free*) chinese soup. We would suggest to stick to their special menu items that are written on the boards on the wall. They come with drinks and soup!"}
{"text":"Fast Dirty Cheap Chinese Food | Limited parking | Free newspaper | Thai/ Hakka/Chinese  Small place at Hwy 7/ Markham Rd off on the (north) side.   Serves a variety of Chinese food; combos available just like your typical HK cafes. It's okay Chinese food if you're just looking for a quick fix but being in the Markham area, there's a ton other places nearby with better quality at the same price.  The floor was dirty and greasy. My soup noodle bowl was plated and when I removed the bowl I saw a pubic-hair like curly hair on it. I hope it was just someone with short curly hair in the kitchen. Also when I came into the restaurant the server gave me a long odd stare.   Overall the food wasn't amazing. Nothing special. It was okay. I wouldn't purposely come back for anything."}
{"text":"Been here many times and almost tried everything on menu. The most I like is their general tao chicken and sweet sour pork. Also their grilled chicken in black pepper or baked pork in tomatoes sauce are good as well if you just want something fast and simple. I'm not a fan of their beef brisket but the brisket is tender, just not the taste that I preferred. Overall, I like this place because the price and portion both reasonable and the most important is the taste that's good."}
{"text":"New restaurant just near Markham Main Street. Probably one of the only Chinese restaurants around this area. If you are looking for a HK style cafe, this is the perfect place to be. I'm a big fan of Richmond Court Restaurant and Blue Ocean Cafe (similar style), however M.Y. Restaurant is wayyyy better than them. Best bang for buck and the service is superb, compared to those restaurants.   When you enter the restaurant, you'll be welcomed by the enthusiastic and super nice staff. The restaurant is a perfect place for families, but don't expect it to be super fancy. It is a very traditional Chinese restaurant.  Recommendation:  I ordered the Minced Meat Bolognese with Spaghetti which was recommended by the staff, and I have to say I was super impressed by this. It was simply delicious and they give you tons of meat too. They'll add cheese onto this, which makes it more rich and tasty. This might be their signature dish, so I'll highly recommend this.  Overall, great restaurant and prices are decent! I would most certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Was around this area and saw some good reviews for this place so I decided to try it out with my boyfriend. Went around 5pm and it was pretty empty. 5pm is a good time to go because they have like a tea time menu (i think it ends at 5:30) but their dinner menu also starts (at 5pm). I was craving noodles in soup but they mostly had fried noodles and rice. I ordered a beef friend spaghetti. It was big portions and the noodles were pretty regular. Some of the beef was very undercooked. My boyfriend ordered a wonton noodle soup which he said was pretty plain. The wontons were pretty regular. This place is pretty regular like any other chinese cafe. I guess the price for the portion its good for people on a budget."}
{"text":"I am impressed how tasty the food was and how good the service was.  Parking is limited at the front but more at the back."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and it has been my go to joint for HK cafe dishes ever since they opened!  The dishes are simple but you can tell that they pay attention to every single detail. I have had quite a few for their baked dishes served with rice or spaghetti. The rice is fried nicely and you can taste the deep savoury egg flavour with every bite. The tomato sauce is legit and perfectly fuses with the melted cheese. It does not have that look where you can tell they use a lot of starch to thicken the sauce.   I have had the ox tongue, sliced beef as well as their baked porkchop - all of which are quite tasty!  Their complimentary soup is always top notch with lots of ingredients put into it. A word of warning for those who cannot handle any heat, their Russian borscht is quite spicy but I do like the added heat!"}
{"text":"New Hong Kong style cafe that took over the spot that used to be Chef Lin. Came here on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm and it was empty.  The four of us ordered a \"pick your own dishes\" combo for 4 that included 4 dishes and 4 bowls of steamed rice.  We ordered a sweet and sour pork chop, beef brisket, oxtail stew and garlic sauteed veggie.  Everything was average, nothing bad and nothing spectacular, but you can definitely taste the MSG.  Service was good because we were the only ones there!  It's nice to finally have a HK style cafe in East Markham!  To end, average food, good service."}
{"text":"So sad that Chef Lin is gone. When my husband and I arrived here hoping get some really good general tao chicken, we noticed the restaurant had changed. We decided to check it out anyway. This place serves a million different dishes, but I figured I might as well try the general tao chicken since I was craving it and some hot and sour soup. My husband ordered the Portuguese style chicken.   You get free soup with some of the meals so we got the wintermelon one which was delicious! Since the free soup was so good, I was hoping everything else would be just as impressive. The hot and sour soup was decent. I can't really describe it but all the dishes we tried were kind of bland or wasn't as flavourful as I would like. The Portuguese chicken was just terrible. The sauce was a watered down bland buttery sauce of some sort. It didn't really taste like anything and my husband usually eats whatever he orders and he barely touched it. The general tao chicken was just average as well. It was sweet and pretty sour, but didn't have that kick that I usually like. The prices were cheap so I would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I convinced my friends to come here with me because I thought it would be one of those tiny tucked away gems with cheap and delicious food but now that I've tried it... it's just another HK style cafe.  Nothing particularly good about it but nothing particularly bad about it either. Parking is a bit limited out front and it's relatively tucked away behind larger establishments - I wouldn't see people finding out about this place unless referred by friends.  I probably won't be back - there are tastier HK style cafes closer to me (borderline Markham/Scarborough)."}
{"text":"This place gets stars for it's huge portion sizes, great prices and friendly staff! I ordered one of the set lunches off their menu board on the wall - eggplant and pork noodles with a soup and hot milk tea for just $8.50! I chose the Chinese soup which was delicious and flavorful, a good way to start the meal. When my noodle dish came, I was shocked, it was enough to feed three skinny people or two normal sized humans! The noodles were okay but it had a lot of oil so it became heavy and filling really quickly. I will probably not order this again and try something else off their menu which is quite extensive! Parking here is very limited, I was lucky enough to grab a spot in the back. I think they only have around 5-6 spots behind the restaurant and 2 in front. This is a good place to come if you're hungry around late afternoon when the restaurant is not as busy!"}
{"text":"My new go to place for Hk cafe foods. It's a small family run restaurant in a side street off highway 7 and Markham road. Food is Delish!!!! Price very reasonable.  Food quantity is just perfect. Can't get those kind of foods for those prices anymore in markham area.  All their daily specials comes with soup and coffee/tea.  Their Chinese soup is nothing to laugh about.  Lots of ingredients and no msg in it.   Tried there many times and never disappointed. Staff is very friendly for hk cafe.  They even have a WeChat group where they send you their daily specials every morning.    Will post some pictures of their food next time. Food is so good and I ate it too fast and forgot to take pictures. Lol"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in main street markham! We have tried their bfast, lunch, and dinner items and they are all really tasty. Portions are very big and well priced. Most meals come with a soup (chinese style or borscht) and a drink. Highly recommend if you want some place to have a filling meal at a reasonable price. It is fairly small inside and not amazing in decor but the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Small Chinese restaurant in the Markham East area, with a parking of maybe 7 spots. Walking into the restaurant, it had a very old cha chan tang styled restaurant. The seats aren't super spacious, especially in the winter with your huge jackets, but it will do.  We got the baked Portuguese sauce with chicken + rice and the beef ho fun. We didn't have to wait very long for it, before the meals came. What I REALLY appreciated was that the baked Portuguese sauce with chicken and rice came in two different dishes. One plate of a scoop of rice and the other had the Portuguese chicken. In many cha chan tang's that I visit, the rice is embedded in the Portuguese sauce - which makes it tasty, but you get a lot less for the quantity of the meal.  The beef ho fun wasn't very oily, and they used fresh ho fun, something you don't see often in many stores. It tasted delicious and was hot and fresh! Both of these meals came with a soup of your choice and a hot drink. The total of this meal was a little less than $15. Super affordable and local in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"3.5- This little cafe is quite hidden in the corner of a small plaza next to a convenience store and 1-2 other shops. The inside of the HK cafe looked like a typical cafe but the tables and chairs felt more roomy.  We came during dinner time so we ordered off the dinner menu. Their daily specials on located on white boards on the wall, the prices on those boards are most likely their lunch prices and dinner is an extra $1 (we weren't informed until the bill came). Everyone ordered the chicken steak with onion sauce. The dish came with a choice of rice/spaghetti/fries, soup, and a drink. The chicken steak was actually quite juicy and tasted great! The sauce might have been a little too salty for my preference and the vegetables that came with it weren't great. The corn was too soggy and mushy. Overall portion size was great for the price and would come again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! So much variety... food heaven. Highly recommend spaghetti and general Tao chicken. The soup is amazing. Service is good but waitresses are not fluent in English. Use basic English."}
{"text":"3.5  Solid spot with classic Hong Kong style food for low prices. They have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner specials. Their daily specials actually change everyday and usually come with a soup of the day, a drink, and either rice or spaghetti. Those are usually ~$8-9 and are too much for one person to finish for a lunch/dinner. Their portions are on the bigger side, so 2 meals will probably fill up 3 people. But do keep in mind that the quality of their food usually isn't that stellar - mostly carbs and simple ingredients.  It seems to be family-run, all the staff are super attentive, friendly, and helpful even when they're packed and super busy on weekends. It's well worth a visit and their prices are definitely cheaper than similar HK style cafes nearby in the Markham area, for basically identical food/drinks/service."}
{"text":"This place used to be named Chef Lin. Not sure if the owners changed, but the food certainly did. The food here is nothing spectacular, but is just plain good. No fancy dishes, just the basics done right. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"It's an HK cafe off of Markham Main Street. Price is dirt cheap and portions are mad redonk. If that makes you happy, drop on by!"}
{"text":"This is a small, tucked away, HK Cafe. Some might recognize the staff and food from a restaurant called Maydoh in Scarborough.  HK cafes typically serve a soup and coffee/tea with every meal. The soup at this restaurant actually tastes good and has a lot of ingredients. The tea isn't that great though.  As for the food, everything we've had has been amazing. They have a weird pricing system where the menu is one price, but after 6pm, the dishes go up $1 so just be aware of that when you visit.  Spaghetti Bolognese ($7.50) Most places skimp on the meat sauce and cheese, but not this place. It's packed with delicious meat sauce and has a generous amount of gooey cheese on the top that actually has flavour.  Black Pepper Chicken/Pork ($9.99/$10.99) The key to a good black pepper chicken/pork is a peppery sauce and a juicy piece of meat. This place nails the sauce as it has a delicious pepper taste with tasty gravy and they give not one, but two pieces of juicy meat!  Curry Beef Brisket ($10.50) It's hard to a find a tasty curry beef brisket in Toronto these days that's not bland or cheap on the amount of brisket served. This restaurant gives a lot of brisket and the curry sauce is bomb."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since there aren't many Hong Kong style cafes in the area. This is a small 30 seat diner hidden just off of Markham Rd. No renovations to speak of for a new restaurant. It looks like they just took over from the last owner.   Service is considerably slow. We waited at the door for a couple minutes before anyone acknowledged us and pointed us to a seat. Ordering was easy as the menu is limited. I will note that the daily special boards don't match on each wall.   Food got here relatively quickly and tasted average. However, we were never served water or tea. The beverages we ordered came after we were halfway through our meal, which is remarkably slow. Iced milk tea was ooookay.   I don't think I will be returning any time soon unfortunately."}
{"text":"Chef Lin is gone : (   M & Y Restaurant is now in its place.  It's a Hong Kong style café.  Their lunch specials are written on the white board; which come with soup and drinks.   We had minced beef spaghetti and pork chop cutlet with salad.  The spaghetti came with borscht soup.  There was generous sauce in the spaghetti and each single strand was flavored.  The soup was rich and loaded with vegetables, but the pork chop was a bit dry though.  Service is quick and attentive.  Grand opening next week!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this gem through Yelp. After going to the gym, we wanted a hearty meal at a casual restaurant in our gym clothes. MY is off Hwy 7 east of Markham Rd. It's a true family owned/style restaurant. We got there close to closing time so the restaurant was fairly empty. The servers were so friendly and attentive, offering suggestions on their specialty dishes and what is popular with the \"younger crowd\". They have an extensive menu of Canto/HK diner style foods - noodles, baked rice, etc. Lots of daily specials, with large portions at reasonable prices. I've taken my mom here for breakfast on the weekends too and it's slammed - gets really busy. All in all, I've gone back 5+ times since my first visit for the great food, reasonable prices, and welcoming servers."}
{"text":"Must try place!! My favorite Hong Kong style restaurant. Food is delicious and portion is big. I am satisfied every time I go there. Order a daily special combo, which comes with the big entree of rice or spaghetti, a soup and a drink. Staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"Was walking in the neighborhood and thought I'd get a quick bite from this restaurant. Looked over their daily special and decided to get the steak dinner with black pepper sauce.  I have to say I was surprised with what I got, the portion was more than generous, steak was done on point with the black pepper sauce, and with the dish I also got rice,  two eggs and side veggies (steamed broccoli). I left the place with an empty plate and got their Hong Kong style tea.  I was glad that I spent less than $16 including tax and tip. Couldn't ask for more for a simple, delicious, and affordable dinner. I will be going back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Tucked into a side street east of Markham Rd and Hwy 7 in Markham is this little restaurant.  Went here at 12:30pm on a Sunday and it was full but table opened up quickly.  Looking through the menu and Specials, it was a HK cafe style menu. Honestly it was a bit confusing as not all the items on Specials menu are same across all the boards but the staff were nice and helpful to clarify.  Ordered haninan chicken rice, curry brisket noodles, singapore rice noodles and curry ox tongue rice.  Overall, it was ok no fuss food for quick stop.  Most meals come with soup and coffee/ hk milk tea.  Hk milk tea was pretty good with light tea taste.  Brisket was very tender, singapore rice noodles was good and huge portion.  Flavour wise it is lacking with no chicken flavour in haninan chicken, curry was more like yellow sauce and seems a slight bit overuse of white pepper in noodles soup and the soup that comes with orders.  The pricing ranges from $6.99 to $12.99.  I would go back but to try the breakfast or tea time (2:30pm - 5:30pm daily) meals."}
{"text":"It's not Lin's anymore but another business is up in its place and we gave it a try.  Combination of authentic Chinese stuff and also those looking for non authentic items.  Has some items you wouldn't expect at a smaller place like this like ox tail.  I feel its important to set expectations.  The food is pretty decent for the price.  Prices are pretty low.  I got a bowl of wonton and beef brisket noodle soup for $7 and that includes milk tea.   Was it the best wonton or brisket I ever had?  By far no but at this price point I really wish we had a place like this near where I live and work.  I was full and would go again.  It's just a great quick cozy mom/pops place to have a decent Asian meal."}
{"text":"I was sceptical about this place at first but the food and service won me over. The person who took our order was very patient and we didn't feel rushed like so many other HK style restaurants tend to do. She pointed out the daily specials that was hanging on the wall and told us the soup of the day. We both ended up getting the minced beef spaghetti and condensed milk toast. I've had the spaghetti in a lot of different restaurants but this one is my new favourite. First of all it's perfectly salted which many places fail to do. Second of all, the sauce is defiantly made from scratch and you can taste the time it took to stew it. The spaghetti is cooked to a perfect texture as well. Our bill came to under 25 dollars so you can't beat that value. Overall I enjoyed the food and will come back in the future."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely amazing! Everyone was super friendly and the food was very delicious. I would definitely recommend the fried rice to anyone looking for something filling and flavourful. Another great thing is that the restaurant does online orders. This saves so much time as you can just walk in and pick up your food without having to wait very long!"}
{"text":"Really happy with my takeout :) im so glad i work near here, i will be coming every lunch"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 Located at Highway 7 and Main Street Markham Rd N, but the entrance is behind Main Street. This place is pretty hard to find, and parking is limited.   [SERVICE] - 3/5 Average. Typical service from a standard Chinese place, all about efficiency, and the food comes quickly.  [DÉCOR] - 3/5 Booths are comfy, but there is nothing fancy about the seating area.  [FOOD QUALITY] - 3.5/5 Satisfactory. A solid meal that is not overly seasoned with MSG.   [ORDER] - 3/5 Hainam Style Chicken - $8.50: chicken was pretty succulent. Scallion, ginger, and oil sauce added a punch of flavour to the chicken. Rice was standard, and broccoli was a great addition to this relatively healthy dish (if you don't drown the chicken in that sauce).   [OVERALL] - 3/5 I would recommend this place if you want cheap and comforting Chinese food. This place meets my expectations for a standard meal, nothing stands out, but everything was \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Not enough meat but I will try again.  The soup is super tasty and so is the food. But a stir fry veggie and meat dish they gave too little meat!  But the standalone black pepper sauce chicken was a huge piece of chicken."}
{"text":"3 star for food + 0.5 star for value + 0.5 star for being in my hood  MY Restaurant has now becomes my to go home in the wall restaurant for cheap eats!  Generous portions, good value and no frills experience.  Don't expect anything fancy. Just simple ingredients and home style cooking.  Great to have something affordable in this neighborhood. Scarborough pricing in Markham. I hope they will be around for awhile at this price point."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  This place is kind of hidden on a small side road.  Limited parking in front, more at the back. Came here in the morning 9am+.  Customers constantly coming in n out.  Old style HK cafe.  Food are good.  Free Chinese newspaper in morning."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new in the area, so I decided to have their general tao chicken *my fav* yesterday.  Our food came really quick and the waitresses were very attentive. The general Tao chicken was made perfectly with bite-sized pieces that were very crispy and tangy. My boyfriend usually doesn't like to eat Chinese food but he was very happy with his curry chicken that were apparently their signature dish.  Overall, the food and service was very good. I'll recommend this place for quick meals and takeouts  (they also deliver from what I read on the menu). Price is super fair with generous portions !!"}
{"text":"Tucked away is a great place to have some hk style food. Tried their minced beef spaghetti and it was great. Lots of cheese and sauce. Portions were generous especially with the lunch special that includes a drink and soup.   Snagged a piece of general tao chicken from my friends plate and it was good. Crispy and deliciously tangy.  Service was fast and courteous  4.5/5 stars for price/ service / quality"}
{"text":"We had the lunch specials : pad thai and chicken curry.  Pad thai was way too sweet for my liking; not very authentic. Curry chicken was decent; good flavour and good curry sauce; chicken was breaded which I didn't expect"}
