{"text":"One of the best places to visit on the Danforth in the summer.
The food is presented well and tastes great."}
{"text":"Pappasgrill gets a meh and two stars.  Today might have been the second, maybe third time we have eaten there.  Food took a while to arrive.  Chicken souvlaki, dry.  Feta burger, dry and overcooked, nearly black. Spanakopita, over cooked and dark brown underneath.  Moussaka, warm, not hot.  Next time we venture out to the Danforth, we will try one of the many alternatives available.  Pappasgrill just does not cut it."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Pappas. Came out for dinner with hubster on a weekday evening. The location was prime. The decor and lighting was perfect for a romantic dinner. We saw the prix fixe promotion for $25 and decided to grab one meal using this deal.

The service was very good, although there was only one waiter for several tables at the time we got in. However, she was prompt and to the point, with unnecessary chatter. 

We ordered a wedge of saganaki ($12) which came out with fresh bread, delicious. The winter pizza with roasted red peppers and sundried tomato (as part of prix fixe) was nicely presented and tasty. We had the chicken souvlaki, which for $16, was slightly overpriced. But the meat was cooked perfectly and potatoes with tzatziki was delectable. The stuffed sole (as part of prix fixe) was well cooked and not dried out."}
{"text":"Went here recentlty on a whim on a Friday evening after work. With all of the Greek restaurants to choose from, we  didn't know which one to pick! Since it was a beautiful day and their patio wasn't packed, we chose Pappas Grill.

I had the lamb souvlaki (medium well) which, in my opinion, was heavenly. Granted, I was starving so anything would've tasted good to me at this point, but my friend also had the lamb and found it to be delish! My BF had the chicken souvlaki and was extremely pleased. We washed it all down with a Somersby Apple Cider beer. Now, 
I DO NOT do beer but when my BF ordered it, I tried it and ordered my own!  People, this is the stuff right here. Maybe I'm late to the party but if you are not a beer drinker, you will Iove this, I promise you.

The service was great and our waiter was VERY attentive. The only thing I will say is that we saw other people getting bread and expected to get some as well prior to our meal but didn't. Not sure if  we were supposed to but didn't bother asking because our food came pretty quickly. Will definetly go back. Give it a try!. Atmosphere is also very nice."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min for someone to just come to my table at 5:30pm.  The place was empty.  Heard waiters arguing over whose section was mine."}
{"text":"To my very great disappointment, my memories of Pappas Grill were dashed! It is a lovely restaurant with a fine patio..just enough off the Danforth to remove the exhaust fumes. Years ago it was a destination for special nights out. Clearly times have changed. A beautiful summer's night and the restaurant was empty and the patio sparse. Well, once the food arrived it was clear as to why. I had a shrimp dish that was tasteless, apart from the very clear taste of the freezer on the shrimp, and my friend had moussaka that appeared to have frozen and microwaved...it never lost its upright, square shape! Our server was lovely, I must add though. What happened to their kitchen?"}
{"text":"Well, this was unfortunately disappointing. Although this restaurant is in a great location, right by Chester Stn., its food falls very short. I ordered the moussaka dish and it was pretty bad. I'm not an expert in Greek cuisine, but I'm pretty sure that moussaka is not supposed to be slimy and slightly gummy. My friend is Greek and has been living in the area for her entire life. Her reaction when I told her that I went to Pappas: Oh no, you chose one of the worst ones. Yikes. Other than the pretty bad food, I had no other complaints. So I guess that warrants an extra star...?"}
{"text":"The patio is absolutely beautiful. 

If you want to sit outside and enjoy the weather then it's a great place. The food? Not so much; I guess I'm lucky I filled up on bread.

The Mahi Mahi fish was more than questionable. First time around it was raw, could have probably flopped off the table. The second time it was over cooked. It seems like there is no happy medium. Also, surprised no manager came out to see how we were doing since our fish came out and went back in to the kitchen just as quickly. Last but not least, the rice pilaf had the consistency of overnight risotto left on the kitchen counter; you can infer the taste from my less than positive comments above. 

Overall atmosphere was pretty good. But if you're coming to eat I suggest heading out somewhere else down the street."}
{"text":"Amazing food!

 I've eaten at a lot of the Greek places on Danforth and this one is my favorite. Great atmosphere and I've never had a problem with service. They bring you bread & olive oil to start (if they don't, just ask!). The calamari is unbelievable here, and the dinner portions are big. Highly recommend both the pork & chicken souvlaki dinner, and the tzatiki :)

Also, the patio is cute to eat on in the summer!"}
{"text":"O.K. food, terrible service.
Dh and I went tonight, thought we'd eat on The Danforth for a change...tons of restaurants to choose from, stumbled upon Pappa's Grill, as Dh had heard it was good.

First off, our server seated us (not the hostess....who knows where she went), oh and the restaurant was only a quarter full, if that.  He then said he would bring us some water to start us off.  Well, the water never came.  He finally suantered over to take our drink order and food order.
The wine took some time to find our table, again he brought no water.  The appetizer...spicey feta dip w/pita wedges took even longer...I mean how long can it possible take to plate this and serve it.

Still no water.  I remind him as he passes us with a cloth to wipe tables on the patio....he nods, then goes out to wipe tables!!!
Later he comes back in and stands over near the bar peering out over the restaurant, again forgetting about the water.  He sees me staring over at him trying to get his attention....finally he get our water!!!!

It seems like we waited forever for our main courses....me: Chicken Fusilli, Dh: Pork Souvlaki dinner...pretty standard stuff....imagine if the restaurant was actually busy...scary to think how much worse the service would have been.
The food was ok...not horrible, not great.  My pasta came with parmesan cheese already on it (not freshly grated).  I was never asked if I wanted cheese....he(the server or maybe the cook) just put it on.  Was not impressed with that.
Server came by once to see if everything was ok, never asked if we wanted more wine.
When he finally brought the check, he never said 'thank you' or 'have a nice evening'.....NOTHING!  Just put it on the table and walked away.

Needless to say, he recieved a $3 tip (could not be bothered to ask for the change from $60...the meal was $57).
Will NOT go back!!!  SO MANY other restaurants to choose from, why settle for sub par service and so-so food.  NO thanks!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, our drinks came over 20 minutes after we ordered, our food took over 40 minutes to come, by then we were starving because they never brought bread or the apetizer we ordered. By the time we got our food it was cold.
The table was shaky and we had to ask 3 times for help.
It was nor cheap.
Their patio looked so nice, I really wanted to give them a chance, but the neighbourhood has far better and cheaper places, we are not going back."}
{"text":"The Saganaki is great, I never thought I'd get excited about fried cheese but it's amazing... You really should try it!!!"}
{"text":"We chose Pappas Grill for nostalgic reasons...I had been there several times 10 years ago and always remembered enjoying it.  We arrived at around 6:30 on a Friday and it wasn't busy, but had a decent number of customers...the upper level was empty, but we got the last table on the main floor.   We started by ordering two dips, the hummus and the scorthalia.  I ordered the scorthalia because it I had never had it, and assumed it would be a nice smooth, garlicky dip, because the menu indicates that it is served alongside the calamari.  The menu says it is a garlicky dip of creamy potatoes, fresh garlic and olive oil.  What arrived was actually a scoop of unevenly mashed potatoes, crumbly and cold straight from the fridge that really just tasted like cold mashed potato...no hint of garlic or olive oil.  The hummus was amazing and saved the restaurant from a one-star review.  It was phenomenal, lots of olive oil, probably more salt than I should consume in a day, but irresistible.

A few minutes after starting our appetizers the mains arrived.  The server arrived, mains in hand and apologetically said \"your meals are ready, is that ok?\"  At that point I'm not sure what we could have said, but he placed the mains on an already overcrowded table and left.

I had the chicken souvlaki, which came with potato, rice and greek salad. It was ok, nothing really stood out as especially good or bad, but I've definitely had better (and probably worse).  My husband had the lamb shank and found it ok as well.  It was a bit dry and not as tender as expected.

So overall a disappointing experience.  The food was overpriced and felt a bit like factory food.  That being said, I would go back for the hummus alone!"}
{"text":"I didn't read the Yelp reviews before my visit as this wasn't my first choice. Probably for the best, as I wouldn't have come here if I had seen its two-star rating. On the night I visited, the nearby Seven Numbers (my first choice) had a long wait for a table, and my bf and I were hungry, so we just came here instead. 

I loved the spread out interior, the tiled floors and garden-ey decor, designed to resemble a patio. The layout of this restaurant really lures you in and is a very refreshing change from the many cramped places nearby. There was a really good atmosphere on the Saturday night we visited - it was busy with patrons, yet not overcrowded, just nicely buzzing. 

The menu is an eclectic mix of Greek, Italian and standard North American fare (NY steak, pork ribs, etc) I had the 'Pappas Rigatoni' (spicy sausage with veg in a cheesy sauce) and really liked it. I was initially worried about how sausage and cheese would go together in a pasta dish, but it worked really well and I was glad I took the risk to try something different. The sauce, which was composed of no fewer than three different cheeses, was surprisingly light, and the meat came in very generous portions. I ended up taking some of it home in a container as it was so filling I couldn't attempt it all.

My bf had the stuffed chicken with spinach and feta and loved it, appreciating in particular how well the chicken was cooked and the generous size of the meal. I had a bite of the chicken and the feta was delish!

I had tiramisu for dessert and again the portion size blew my mind! It was delicious and I ate every last bite of the dessert even though I couldn't finish my entree...whoops. 

While my enjoyment of the food here is in contrast with many reviews below, my experience with the service seems to be perfectly consistent with everyone else's. This struck me from the second we arrived. The host (who also ended up being our server) wasn't rude, but did the absolute. bare. minimum in every regard. 'What do you want?' was the instruction for us to place our food orders and 'dessert or no?' with no smile or attempt to engage us was the prompt for ordering after-dinner treats. More significantly, the service was SLOW. We waited a long time for our meals, same for drinks and desserts. Server passed by multiple times and didn't acknowledge the delay, just kept silently filling us up with more baskets of bread!

That said, in terms of food and atmosphere, I'd happily return here. I can only review my own experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food that I was served. However, I would not recommend this restaurant if you are in any sort of a hurry."}
{"text":"I was invited to a dinner at this restaurant, but being a somewhat health conscious and picky eater, and reading so many negative reviews that repeated similar experiences, I considered declining the invite! I am intolerant to sitting polite over a terrible meal.  Then I realized I had to risk a possible bad food experience for the sake of friendship and did decide to go.  I ordered one of the dishes mentioned many times in these reviews-chicken souvlaki.  It came with a boiled potatoe, rice, and a salad with shredded Feta cheese.  I substituted Hummus (chick pea dip) for the yogurt dip that originally would have come with it.   So this is what I found:  large juicy chunks of chicken, tasty, very gentle on the spices-just the way I like it, but a bit burned on the outside.   But, fine.  Also there was a small serving  of saffron rice-delicious.  And-that was about it.  The salad was drenched in oil-an option of dressing on the side is usually pretty standard and offered-so that was missed.  The boiled potato looked more like a sliced  apple that is discoloured inside  from exposure to air-really soggy looking and overcooked to a light brown color.  The hummus-no taste at all, looked as if it had been sitting in the fridge, and served in a small metal cup, it felt like Air Canada food.  But, I've had this same dish in two other well known Danforth restaurants-this souvlaki here was the best of all three places-just need to cook it a bit less, and follow through in quality on the other side dishes-instead the other dishes are just sort of there to fill up space, and that's it.  My neighbour ordered a lamb souvlaki with a large pile of runny yogurt almost dripping off the plate.  They should have used the small metal dish  for that and not the hummus which was so thick you could glue a tile with it on your kitchen floor.
The pros: great atmosphere-the place was pretty much empty at 6:00 on a summer week night-but indoors was air conditioned.  Waiter was very kind and friendly to a table of 10 or so.  I'm a bit beyond the Buffalo wings and beer stage (been there done that) so, someone who may just want to get a few beers and something to go along with it, might be fine with Pappas. 
Myself: I've given up on Mid east food on the Danforth in general-Mashu Mashu at Spadina and St Clair is 100 per cent better, for less or the same in cost.  If you prefer to stick to the Danforth-and go non mid east, may I suggest Libretto for the best pizza and desserts in town or Allen's-next to the Danforth Music Hall.  Allen's could cost a bit more, but again, for fish, chicken, choices of wild or farmed Salmon, delicious non gluten dishes or an amazing Angus hamburger  or steak -it's an excellent place for a beer or a dessert or for the health conscious like me who would love a tasty healthy meal without worry.  Point is: for 25.00 a person on average for a meal and one drink, you can do much better on the Danforth than Pappas."}
{"text":"Came here for paint nite. The service was ok, the two hostess at the front are anything but friendly, they were on their phones texting the whole time, the drinks are overpriced.

The only thing i liked about this place was their drinks."}
{"text":"The olive oil tasted nothing like olives. The bread was stale. Our lamb souvlaki was tough and lacked flavour. This kitchen doesn't even know how to turn out the basic staples of Greek-American cuisine. One of the many places on the Danforth that is coasting. One star is for the nice outdoor space."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday during Taste of the Danforth. The staff were very friendly and accommodating during a downpour outside. There were able to quickly find us a table inside.
Our waiter was very friendly and service was good.
We ordered hummus and pita bread to share which tasted delicious.
Our mains were not the best we had. I had the fried calamari and my husband had the mousaka. 
We were so full we did not eat anything else for the rest of the day. 
Truth be told as soon as we left the restaurant our tummys were rumbling. We went home and decided to turn in early.
The next morning it hit us. We both suffered major stomach cramps and severe diarrhea. It was so bad we barely ate anything.
It didn't end there. Sunday evening was a challenge as well. It's fair to saw we both had food poisoning.
I wanted to call the restaurant but figured with the festival that they would be busy.
I hope you read this and look into the kitchen practice."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. My favourite was their grilled calamari dinner. I had spend many lunches and dinners there and everyone always liked it. It is spacious, and often quite deserted except for the weekends when it is packed, and the patio is pretty nice. The service is ok, nothing exceptional but not bad either. However, I went there a couple of Saturdays ago with out of town guests and ordered my usual, grilled calamari, and was shocked when it was delivered: the portion was half of what it used to be. Everyone at the table was shocked too, their portions have shrunk quit significantly (not a single one out of the four of us left the table feeling full) but the prices had remained the same. Service on that day though was great. I brought up my concerns to the server's attention who told me he had been there less than a month and wouldn't be aware, but confirmed my suspicion upon speaking to the kitchen. Now I am not one to often complain about portion sizes as I typically have trouble finishing even half my food, but this was just too much!"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here today.  It was very quiet but that's not unusual on a Tuesday on the Danforth.  I feel like I've been here before many years ago.  It's a nice space, lots of it.  The service was good but again, not too many other diners.

There wasn't anything on the lunch menu that was screaming at me so I ended up going with the pork souvlaki, which came with rice, potatoes, Greek salad and tzatziki.  It was...ok...fine...nothing really wrong with it.  The pork was a little tough which always makes me wonder if it was reheated on the grill from last nights dinner.  When there are zero juices visible in meat fresh off the grill, this is usually why.  But the flavour was good.

Overall, it was fine.  I'm not inspired to go back or maybe I will but won't remember I was ever there before."}
{"text":"Over priced ordered the veggie souvlaki which was one small skewer of vegetables for $18.95.  Asked for no potatoes or rice said they would give me veggies instead which they forgot. Finally brought  them, swimming in butter. Waitress walked by table 6 times till she took our plates away. Ordered baklava was tiny and stale. Not impressed would not return. Gave 2 stars as hubby's meal was \" ok not great.\""}
{"text":"Went here for brunch expecting a lot. Great decor inside, roomy with lots of seating and nice comfortable decor.

The food, however, was awful. Just awful. 

My friend and I both ordered omelettes off the brunch menu: our waitress wrote down the wrong omelette for my friend but he took what she brought out anyways not wanting to make a fuss. Neither omelette had any taste whatsoever and we had to heavily salt them.

Service was subpar - we had to keep asking for water when our glasses were plainly empty sitting on the table. The restaurant was not busy at all either so not sure why this was.

Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm always tricked into going here by how nice the patio looks.  Don't be fooled.  Went for lunch recently on a beautiful day, decided it was such a nice patio we should eat at Pappas.  First off the server (older woman) was completely indifferent to us.  Fake nice, you could tell she was having a hard time not rolling her eyes at us when we asked for things like lemon with our pop.  Secondly the food was terrible.  I didn't find the portions large, the chicken souvlaki tasted like it had been soaked in water, the salads were tiny and the dressing disappointing, and the prices quite expensive especially given the quality and quantity.

We waited a lonngggg time to order, and for our bill, to the point where I had to finally get up and go inside, track her down (she was chatting with a colleague and seemed irritated that I interrupted) to ask for the bill; then we still had to wait at least another 5 minutes for her to bring it to the table.  We were one of 3 tables she was ignoring, so it wasn't like she was swamped and couldn't get to it.   

Given the amazing number of Greek restaurants in the area I wouldn't waste another penny at Pappas.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Nice on a warm night, dinner was good, the service was attentive, and the Saganaki was a hit. All and all a decent experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the times I should have looked at the Yelp reviews first.
We were hungry and decided to stop in here for a bite.

We were seated eventually after I flagged down a host.
Bringing us the menus was slow.
Ordering was slow.
Food execution was... slow.
The souvlaki was passable.  Not overly dry but nothing stand-out.

Overall, with so many great options in the area I won't be returning to Pappas Grill."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in Toronto .. I wish I could rate it lower Like minus 5 .. is it so difficult to prepare a descent meal? Seems so for this place .. do not go"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation.  They gave us two, that right two pieces of octopus and charged me $20, then they served me lamb that was all gristle and fat like I've never had good lamb before.  

What a waste!!"}
{"text":"I been to many restaurants on the Danforth and I haven't tried Pappas Grill before, so why not and give it a go. The food was ok, but  you can get similar cuisine along the Danforth. The service was terrible very slow. It made my first time experience less likable and I don't think I'll be going back.

The server didn't seem welcoming at all and felt rushed to order. After we got our bill which was combine (I felt bad because we didn't ask on split bill from the beginning when we ordered), we asked if we can split our bill between the couple. She went on tangent very rudely saying i would have ask my manger to void the order and doing everything again, can't you guys just split the bill 50/50 i assume it was one bill if you guys asked from the very beginning i would of split the bill. So how did you want to split it. 

It wasn't so much of the context of the situation, we ended up splitting according amongst ourselves but the body language and tone of her voice that put me off. I still tipped 15% because we all have shitty days and I use to work in the food industry I get it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was great atmosphere, I took my mother there for mother's day. she really enjoyed it and had a great time."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was incredible and the souvlaki was tender, moist and delicious.  The patio was quaint and the staff was helpful- this was a great place.

Just don't go during Taste of the Danforth..the entire festival sucks and all restaurants plummet in service during it. 

Don't fill up on bread, because they really will just keep stuffing you with it..our waitress brought us about 5 baskets...clever girl (no, she was not a velociraptor)"}
{"text":"I'm also another Yelper that's confused to why there are so many negative reviews on this page. I've been coming here with family for years, and had gatherings here in the past as well. This is my go-to restaurant in Danforth and I have never been disappointed before.

There's a wide variety of food and drink selections, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the staff are so friendly and helpful.

If you're looking for appetizers definitely try the fried calamari and the mussels! The calamari makes you want to lick your fingers after you're done and the mussels don't have that fishy taste/smell that you get at other restaurants.

My personal favourite is the lamb souvlaki! The meat is a bit too chewy, but the pieces are quite large so I always find myself taking some home afterwards because I can't finish my food at the restaurant. I'm a big fan of their greek salad too. 

If you feel discouraged by the other reviews, I say still give Pappas a chance! Since it's two floors it's a great place for parties, and even for quiet dates.

I hope Pappas is here for years to come!"}
{"text":"I was recently here for a wedding celebration dinner with my boyfriends Greek family. We went on a very hot night so the restaurant had all the windows open for the breeze to come though which was totally needed. There was about 30 of us in total and it was great that we could all be in the same area. 

Now onto the fun stuff- The food was pretty good, not amazing but it was tasty! I got this fish which I NEVER do - I was feeling spontaneous that night. I also got to try a bite of the pork souvlaki, and needless to say I was super happy I got the fish.   

The service however was..welll not really welcoming at all. We had a super cold server who clearly didn't want to be there. She wouldn't even set our food or drinks down herself- she handed it to each of us to figure out who ordered what. So not the best experience there.

BUT I have to say over all it was a lovely night out and due to the fact there were so many of us I have to give the restaurant kudos for keeping up."}
{"text":"Came here with a very large group on a Thursday night for a dinner, and had a decent meal. The group ordered a bunch of appetizers (dips, saganaki, fried eggplants, calamari) and then everyone got mains. The dips were all very tasty and I enjoyed the eggplant and calamari as well. The saganaki was tasty, but I'm not sure if I've ever had bad saganaki before.

For the main, I ordered a beef souvlaki (medium rare). The portion was massive, four big chunks of beef, peppers, a healthy amount of salad on the side, a pile of rice and some big potatoes. I was impressed. The beef was cooked well, although a bit lacking in flavour. The salad, rice, and potatoes were sumptuous, as expected. I thoroughly enjoyed my plate.

Since we were a very large group, I'm not sure how to rate the service. One of the waiters was fantastic all night, kept coming to check on us. However, it did take a long time for a part of the table to get water at the beginning, which was a bit annoying. But again, being in a large group probably affected that. I would rate their service was good.

Overall, the experience was enjoyable. I rarely come down to this area of town so I'm not sure I'd be back again, but if I did find myself in the area, I'd definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Today I and my friends had lunch here and we also had a short interview with the manager. The service is really good. The manager was pleased to share with us. The food is almost really delicious."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has such a low rating. I loved it here so much last night. I came here with a group of friends for paint night but we had dinner first. The place was so beautiful inside and has a great patio for if the weather ever warms up. I had the mushroom chicken penne and it was absolutely amazing. I haven't had pasta that good in such a long time. It was the perfect amount of cream. I wish I could have it right now. My friends got the lamb and they loved it. I tried the lamb shank and it was very soft. The riesling they had was also great. Not too sweet or dry. The food came out so fast. Our waitress was so great and working so hard. The paint night downstairs was also wonderful and such a great time. I probably wouldn't have gone here otherwise but I'd definitely go back for this great food and service. Lots of street parking and also green p parking too."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner here and got the $25.00 pre fixed meal. The service was pretty good and so was the food, not sure why others had given this place lower than 3 stars. I had the mussels for an appetizer, the bass fish fillet, and the tiramisu + lemon cake for dessert. Overall would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my experience at Pappa's Grill. The food was okay (nothing special) and the service was really bad. We literally had to chase down our waiter to get water and order our meals. 

The Pros:
A nice patio
Big portions

The Cons:
Bad Service

When I stood up after my meal my friend noticed something on my jeans. I immediately thought it was tziki sauce. When I went to wipe it off, I discovered it was gum. Someone had put gum on my chair and now there was sticky gum all over my pants. I know this isn't the restaurants fault, but they should have inspected the tables/chairs a little more closely after each use/cleaning. 

Once I got home, It took me 45 minutes to get the gum out of my jeans. Let me not forget to meantion how gross this was. I had to use my nails to pull someone else's gum off of my jeans. 

Before I left the restaurant I told the host about this incident. The host had nothing to say and left to take other customers to a table. I found a man who looked like the owner and I told him about this and he did nothing for me. I was disappointed with this experience. I think the restaurant could have done a better job on trying to make the situation right after this occurred.

I told (the potential owner) about this so they could check the table and make sure this wouldn't happen to another guest. His initial reaction was to not be proactive. I literally had to encourage him to go and check the tables so this wouldn't happen to another customer."}
{"text":"Ok, when I noticed that Pappas has only 2.5 stars, I had to give them a 4. Not that I wanted to give them a 4, but I truly believe that Pappas is a solid 3.5! I grew up on the Danforth and there are few good Greek places remaining compared to what the area was like in my childhood in the 80s. 

There are a few higher-end places close by that have survived as well plus a few dives that get WAY more credit than they deserve. Pappas lands right in the middle. The quality of the food here is solid! It's not the best of the best but it's far better than the plebeian fair that is also widely available as well.

If you want something a bit more serious than a quick stereotypical greek dinner but don't want to empty your wallet at one of the other fru-fru Greek joins close by, then Pappas is your best stop!

Enjoy! :D"}
{"text":"I was out at Pappa's Grill on Labour Day (September 5,2016) with my family. It was a beautiful day, so we decided to sit out on the patio after having a look at the menu. The menu is left out in front of the restaurant for walker-bys to take a look at. The menu is very similar to the rest of Greek restaurants on the Danforth. You have your souvlakis, gryos, salads, fish and salmon all cooked up pretty much the same way though what sold us at this location was the pretty patio and the charisma of the cute waiter standing at the front of the restaurant.

My family (six of us) and I enjoyed all sorts of different plates. The only one I will mention is the one I ate which was the Salmon Hollandaise Benedict located on the brunch menu. The wait for the food was perfect. Not too long to make you want to get and leave and not too short to make you think the food was already made and sitting out with the flies.

My dish was yummy, nothing too special about it. The plating wasn't too nice. It looked like the potatoes were just thrown on the plate as well as the few pieces of fuit but anyways it was yummy and I guess that's what counts. 

The other dishes on the table looked fantastic and was wonderfully plated. I guess I was the only one with the bad luck. Haha. I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"I don't normally complain, as I was in the service industry for years, so when I do, IT'S BAD.

My boyfriend and I arrived here at 2 PM on Sunday.  We we're sat right away on the patio.  The place didn't seem overly busy; there was a family of 8 in out section and a couple other duces. As beverages, we ordered Caesars and waters, which came promptly.  For meals, he got a chicken Caesar and I ordered eggs over easy from the brunch menu. 

Things seemed to be taking a while.  Our waitress didn't come by to see if we wanted refills on our empty Caesars or waters.  After 40 minutes-  yes, 40 minutes, our food came to the table.  My eggs were wrong, and I told her, but said it was ok, and she walked away without saying anything.  

We ate our meals as we were starving at this point and got the cheque.  Lucky for our waitress, my boyfriend picked up the tab and tipped her- I have NEVER left nothing when I have been out to eat, but the lack of service, communication, and messing up my order certainly warranted a big fat goose egg of a tip.

We won't be coming back.  Save your money and your time and go somewhere where the servers actually care and you get better value for your money.  It was gross and the servers there are either super arrogant or completely clueless"}
{"text":"Went to Pappas Grill for a birthday dinner, we had reservations for 5, was seated promptly but were given a table meant for 4 with an extra chair added at the end which was a little disappointing  since this was a celebratory dinner as we felt cramped and seated awkwardly in the middle of a walkway for the wait staff. The food was average, we ordered the lamb souvlaki which was overcooked and dry but the chicken souvlaki on the other hand was juicy and perfectly cooked. The portion servings was huge consisting of a Greek salad, rice and large potatoes and we probably could have just ordered 1 main for two people but we wanted to try different menu items. We also ordered the calamari and hummus which was also very good, we had also the dolmades which is minced beef and rice filling wrapped in a grape leaf which we thought was kind of tasteless. Overall pretty average Greek restaurant on the Danforth, the next time we are in Greek town we will probably try some place different."}
{"text":"Wow, here is a case of glad-I didn't-know-the-rating.  We had some time to kill before looking at an apartment in the area, and it was lunchtime so we stopped in at Pappa's Grill based on the fact that we could order brunch OR lunch.  

It's a very large restaurant for Toronto, and very nice inside.  I was quite impressed.  The service wasn't stellar, but it wasn't bad.  The hostess seemed somewhat disoriented to be honest, but she got us to a table.  I selected the delicious sounding lemon cream French toast, and my SO the pork souvlaki.  We had only water to drink, and were refilled frequently.  

The food didn't take too long to come out, as some have mentioned in previous reviews.  They were very generous portions and decent prices.  The brunch especially was on par with the prices at other brunch establishments.  

I didn't taste the souvlaki (not really a taste to combine with French toast), but my dish was fantastic.  I've often found that when I order stuffed French toast, the filling can be overwhelming.  That wasn't the case here at all.  It was generous, but understated.  Maybe it's because (sweetened) lemon lends itself well to being a mild flavour in a dish.  It came with a skewer of fresh fruit that was fantastic, and only had a single piece of evil melon.  There was also a dish of real maple syrup for dunking the bread in.  The bread, by the way, was about as thick as 4 slices of regular bread, and the dish came with two portions.  I believe it was probably cooked as a cake.  Anyways, the point is that it was delicious and the flavours all melded very well together.  

All in all, good prices, okay service, very nice atmosphere, and one of the best orders of French toast I've ever had.  If I end up with an apartment in this area, this will definitely be a place I revisit for brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in this may 2-4 weekend. We were looking for some Greek food and a patio. We got what we were seeking. 
Saganaki was one of the best I've had in a while. If you like Greek dips, I suggest Avli across the street for selection, but the ones at Pappas were nothing to shake a stick at. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I've come here maybe once or twice a year for many years now, and it's just as amazing every single time. 

I had a Musaka with greek salad, and it was both filling and very tasty. 

PS. I highly recommend the greek style coffee over the regular one if you're looking for a caffeinated drink"}
{"text":"\"The space was not too tall, split level with a very pleasant communal feel. It was socially inviting and visually interesting with lots of small elements adding to the atmosphere.\"
\"Melanzano had baked eggplant with red onion, garlic and parsley - a bit spicy with a smoky smell of meat - to the point where we doubted if it was a vegetarian dish. \"
\"Cooking chicken to make it retain moisture without being raw is an art and Papas excelled here. One of the best souvlakis we tasted in long time. \"
A few bites from our full review.."}
{"text":"I've been to Pappas Grill several times over the years.  Was never blown away by the food but it was above average.  This seems to have changed.  I went the other day and my guest and I were disappointed.  Instead of bashing the establishment, I'd rather give them some constructive criticism.  Ordered Chicken Souvlaki.  The chicken itself was ok (not bad, not great).  A little small but no real complaints.  Salad was OK.  I didn't like having it on the same plate as the Souvlaki though.  Typically the salad is served separately.  What bothered me and my guest the most was the potatoes.  Quite possibly the worst potatoes I've ever eaten.  My potatoes were rock solid, so I tasted my guest to see if hers were the same way.  They were hard too.  This was inexcusable to me as the potatoes are the easiest thing to cook.  Service was pretty good although the place was pretty empty.  Liked the bread.

I'm giving a 3 but mainly because I can't give a 2.5.  For what I paid, the food should have been much better.  Hopefully you can make some adjustments and boost you ratings!"}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch at Pappas Grill as we had never ate at this establishment before.

It was a Tuesday at noon and the place was empty. I hope that this place is busier in the evenings, for the owner's sake. Right from the get-go, service was slow. We stood around for a few minutes before a staff member noticed us and seated us to a table. 

The pricing is on the higher side. Case in point: a burger and fries will cost you $14. Now, I'm all about spending money on food, but $14 for a burger is hardly worth it.

Our server was quick to take our order. From our table, items ordered were: the Greek Burger; the Moussaka; and the Pork Souvlaki. The food itself was pretty good. The Moussaka was probably the best out of all three; I've tasted some bad Moussaka in Toronto over the years. 

The food took ages to come to our table. Who knows? Maybe the kitchen staff make this stuff from scratch... like they actually go pick the eggplants for the Moussaka and go buy the pig for the Pork Souvlaki. Being on summer break, time was not of the essence, but my patience was being tested. We waited a good 30-35 minutes for our food. Our server barely came to the table, to the point that I had to go to the kitchen and get water for myself.

The food is good... cannot say the same for the service. 
Don't go out of your way to eat at Pappas Grill."}
{"text":"The Good:
-Homey atmosphere
-Good variety on menu
-Fair service

The Bad:
-The food which is the main part!
My pasta dish (with sundried tomatoes and chicken) was dry and seemed to be reheated. My guests Chicken Supreme was pan-fried dry. It was disappointing food quality for what you would expect from such a restaurant.

Overall: Would prefer to check out other restaurants on the Danforth next time rather than returning."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto for the night. Being Greek I like to try Greek places everywhere. Decided on this place even though there are at least 10 other Greek places on this street, it being Greek town and all, because of its patio. So pretty and full of flowers. 

All the other restaurants were packed but this one only had 3 tables. It was around 9:30pm on Thursday night.

We decided to try different mezzes:
Village salad, taramosalata, saganaki were delicious. 

Fried calamari and pickled octopus were just okay. The calamari lacked flavor and the octopus may have just been a preference choice because I prefer it on the grill. We also ordered the lamb chops. I prefer those grilled too for a Greek restaurant but did not appear grilled.

It being a Greek restaurant they only had one Greek bottled beer fix, which was odd because most of the beers were Japanese.

There was one big problem at this restaurant and had it been that the food wasn't good would have been worse. There is no management at all!!! 
A nearby table was upset about their service and that the hadn't received there correct order of food and the customer was livid. Cursing and all. Not sure if this is considered normal but for me it is not. No manager or even hostess appeared once.

3 stars for food
2 stars for management/service
1 star for cleanliness their bathrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"First time coming to Pappas Grill, and probably my last time too. In short, it's a stylish and atmospheric restaurant with a limited menu and mediocre food. 

My first impressions of Pappas were great. The restaurant looked so beautiful across the street with many noisy customers dining outside a beautiful patio. My boyfriend and I don't usually like trying out new restaurants, but we decided to give it a go since it had such a warmth in the atmosphere.We were seated fairly quickly, while the server was quite friendly and all smiles. So far, so good.

Unfortunately, the food came and it just didn't taste that good. I was expecting a little more flavour from a 'grill', but all the food just ended up tasting quite the same. All the dishes tasted quite dry and felt a bit cold in our mouths. Our initial excitement died down after our first few bites. We managed to finish all of the food that we ordered, but both my boyfriend and I agree that we probably won't return here again."}
{"text":"We had the village salad (good), lamb souvlaki (ok) and moussaka (cold, boring). Won't go back, there are many better in greektown."}
{"text":"While walking down the Danforth after a gym session at the goodlife at pape, my two friends and I settled on the decision to try Pappas grill. We were guided to the patio seats and given the menu. The menu has all the Greek staples. We ended up ordering the souvlaki, Greek fries and saganaki. Our server seemed a bit abrasive, but we didn't have any issue with it at first. The saganaki was delicious. The Greek fries were a tad too salty but still good regardless. The server had a very obnoxious attitude at this point, and did not attend to us asking for a refill of water. We ended up waiting over 20 mins for a simple request for water as we were parched at this point. We had to resort to ask a different server for it. Overall the food was decent but the service can use some work."}
{"text":"We figured we'd give this place another try, for dinner, passing by all my favourite Greek restaurants on the danforth.
The service this time was a little bit better, not much better though. 
The good was mediocre. The lamb souvlaki was very good.  The chicken and the pork souvlaki was less than average. Both were very dry. Greek potatoes and the rice were both awful."}
{"text":"A large group of ours 20+ was able to get in on practically no notice. We were served drinks immediately. The menu is not extensive but there is a lot of options regardless. The staff was very friendly, the washrooms are well kept, the food was good. The baklava was awesome. No complaints. : )"}
{"text":"We tested the brunch on a Sunday and this place is clearly a mess! 

They cannot cook eggs Benedict, they serve it hard boiled... (see picture!) and the answer to my complaint was \" they're too busy in te kitchen! \". 


Lack of organisation, servers are stressed and run everywhere. 

People who arrived after us have been served before. 

It's expensive and the plates are in poor quantity and quality. Just like the service. 

I don't recommend!! Danforth is full of good places to eat, just avoid this one!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting just how substandard Pappas Grill is and once a year or so I keep going back--much to my regret.  Maybe this review will serve as a permanent reminder never to return.

Most of the reviews here are leaning toward the negative.  The best thing about Pappas is the atmosphere with soaring ceilings and exposed brick.  One of the best looking restaurants on the Danforth I'd say.  But it all goes downhill from there.

The service started out okay, but got worse as the lunch went on.  We ordered an appetizer and were only a third of the way through it when the main course came.  Not the best timing.  My biggest complaint about Pappas is the price and the portions.  I ordered grilled sea bass and when it came I couldn't believe the size of the fish.  The two tiny pieces put together were about the size of an IPod.  Not an IPAD--no, no . . . . an IPOD.  Miniscule and almost flavourless--even with the nondescript drizzle of orange liquid on top.  And a so-so side salad.  Nothing else.  All for the not so bargain price of $15.  My friend just had a salad (for $14) which he said was okay, but not great.

We had a couple of beers each and the whole meal added up to more than $80 with tax and tip.  And we both left hungry!  So I wouldn't recommend Pappas Grill at all.  If you still want to try it, I'd recommend showing up with a full wallet *and* a full stomach."}
{"text":"The menu is always on point. we usually start with an appetizer, usually the Spanakopita or my personal favorite, Saganaki. When I come, I mostly order the chicken or pork souvlaki. I find the flavor and moisture of everything to be quite decent, not too salty, delicious greek salad - I have never had any reason to complain about anything - been about 5 times in total. 

The atmosphere is low key and the service staff are polite, on their game, and consistent. The waitresses are also pretty cute. 

I will most definitely be returning - in Danforth Greek town, an area being steam rolled over by new corporate owned restaurants - it's refreshing to have Pappa's Grill keep it on a personal level. My genuine feelings are that food is only as good as the people who cook it - I usually have better experiences with restaurants where the business owner has an active role in the restaurant service chain rather than playing no participating role at all."}
{"text":"It's soo hot in Toronto! If you're wearing a dress/shorts - don't sit outside.. The seats are those metal waffle chairs that are soo uncomfortable. 
The dip platter is nice, my fav was the feta with peppers.. Very rich and sharp

grilled calamari - for the light eater its healthy and oiled nicely

Mediterranean salad - MEH - kinda boring.. 

The Lamb Slouvaki was REALLY good! REALLY good.. GET IT!"}
{"text":"On our last visit here, we had dinner for 4, and were seated on the patio.  The view was great for people watching, as we were seated right on the Danforth side (there are only 3 tables there).  

I've been to a few greek restaurants on the Danforth, this was not our favourite.  One DC ordered the roasted chicken (ok), another the lamb souvlaki (tasted gamey), chicken souvlaki (ok).  We ordered the \"opa\" flaming cheese (I forget what that's called) - the flame went out early, so the experience was not as good as it could have been.  We also ordered the dips - one of the cheese dips was extremely salty.  The hummus was ok however.  Being a warm day, I ordered a salad, as the rest of the meal was quite heavy.

Our dining experience was further marred by the adjoining table - consisting of a rude man, and his DC.  He totally freaked out on the staff, the owner, and everyone else, making the atmosphere less than enjoyable, but that's not the fault of Pappas Grill.  Despite the drama, I think I'd choose one of the other places on the Danforth, just cuz the food could have been better."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve to be called a restaurant. The food was so bad that food court food tasted like a 5 star restaurant compared to this. As a big fan of Greek cuisine I didn't even know that you can make Greek food taste bad... But I guess I was wrong. And don't even get me started on their glassware.. I got my cocktail in a plastic cup. For 15 bucks I expected to have at least a glass cup!
We ended up with a $100 bill, very hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"It's not what it used to be.  Sad. Frozen pre made spanakopita.  Frozen calamari. The oven at the front is gone, so no fresh bread or pizza. Wtf happened to this place?  

The rice was dry and tasted like it was sitting.  Wish I knew before I came that it had gone down the drain. 

I used to love this place.  

So sad."}
{"text":"Just, not good. The taramasalata was pasty, the chicken was dry, and they wanted to charge for substitutions.

Don't let the nice big venue fool you into thinking you can get good Greek food here. You're much better off crossing the street and walking Pantheon...now that's quality!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family on a Saturday night ambience of the restaurant seemed great thought why not give it a try. Seated immediately which is a good thing especially when one of your guest is diabetic and has to eat at certain times.

Pretty dark in the restaurant candle lighting at the table. I order the Lamb Souvlaki and guests order over items.

My food arrived and looked good again cannot tell based on the poor lighting in the restaurant. Started cutting into my lamb Souvlaki and found after two bites that there was this unpleasant after taste which is rare as i love lamb and have enjoyed Lamb Souvlaki at other restaurants but something about this made me not want to eat it and found i was forcing it down.

Before my 3rd bite decided as i could not see the meat would smell it and to my amazement the meat was smelt rotten.

I am not one for making a scene called the manager over and showed her the food she came back and apologised profusely for the incident and said she admitted the meat was spoiled and it was possibly a bad batch.

Replaced my meal with another dish which was ok but after eating rotten lamb kind of took the appetite away."}
{"text":"There are plenty of Greek options in this area, but my friend recommended this one for dinner.  A nicely decorated split level space while still being homey. The service was prompt but was patient when we mulled over our menu choices.

We ended up with a Greek Fries and Tzatziki to share. The greek fries was 'meh' at best, okay fries with a pile of feta cheese on top with a sprinkle of oregano. The Tzatziki was really good though, plenty of garlic in the dip for every bite. My vegetarian friend recommends the Village Salad because there is no lettuce as filler but still delicious. I had the lamb chops which was very tender and well seasoned. The prices are a little on the expensive side but not a bad place for dinner."}
{"text":"We went to the Pappas Grill for brunch.

Things to love:
- enjoying the patio in late September when the weather is great
- their big patio is on the side street so you are not facing all the Danforth traffic and it is a bit quieter.
- breakfast items under $10 on the menu
- good variety on the lunch menu too

Other things:
- service is a bit slow, it appeared that they did not have enough servers on, but ours was very friendly and even lowered the awning for us
- we weren't in a hurry so it was ok -- was nice to linger being that the weather was so good and we were catching up with friends anyways
- btw folks - we live near the Danforth and the pace is slower here, so get used to it!

The food:
The eggs benny looked great and my friend said it was very good.  I had the luncheon sized pork souvlaki and my hub had the grilled calamari.  Both good -- and we ordered warm pita on the size which was very good.

The lunch was reasonable and we even added a 1/2 litre of wine for under $20 which is pretty good also."}
{"text":"Time to clean and renovate. The nasty deodorizer stench from the restrooms in the basement hit me as soon as I walked in the front door. We thought we'd give the benefit of the doubt and sat down to review the menu. My partner went to the rest room and found them to be as dirty as they smelled. needless to say, we didn't stay for dinner as a result.  If the rest rooms are nasty, chances are the kitchen is cleaned with as little attention."}
{"text":"Terrible service but fantastic spot for brunch.  

I have never eaten dinner here but living close by, I've stopped in for brunch a number of times.  The food is delicious and very affordable.  Under ten dollars for a better than average eggs bennie is a steal.  The sides, whether they are the rosemary potatoes with carmalized onion or the greek salad are fantastic and I often order my breakfast based on which one I am craving more. 

The service ranges from decent (not great) to bad with mixed up orders, slow service, and general grumpiness.  

And yet I'll keep going back for those yummy potatoes.."}
{"text":"I ate at Pappa's with a few friends during Taste of the Danforth and it was great, especially given the high volume of customers this past weekend. The tirokefteri dip was incredible - very spicy and flavourful. 3 guests had the chicken souvlaki dinner, and the chicken was moist and tender, with generous portions of potatoes, rice and greek salad. I ordered the 'Garithes Me Feta' and was only disappointed at the fact that there wasn't more of it. At $13 for an appetizer, I hoped to receive more than 4 pieces of shrimp, but the flavours of the roasted tomatoes and onions were great!! The baklava dessert was a generous portion, and delicious. 
The service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected given that it's probably the busiest weekend of the year. Our server, Matthew, was attentive and provided excellent recommendations. 
I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pappas for drinks and apps twice now, and for those purposes it's good - although the service has been a little brutal both times (and it's been on slower evenings). I highly reccomend the dip platter they offer (I can't remember the exact deal but you chose a couple kinds of their dips for around $12) and it comes with a generous portion of pita and dip. The tirokefteri dip is unbelievable - I find myself craving it all the time. The melanzano and others are also great, I had surprisingly good calamari there as well. I had a couple martinis that weren't great, and I was overcharged but my friend and I were in quite a hurry so I didn't have time to dispute it.  Great decor on the inside and the patio gets great afternoon sun, so if you don't have overly high expectations it's good food for decent prices."}
{"text":"Stay away!  Seriously !  Where do I start? Went with my daughter, arrived at 7 PM and we were one of three small groups.  Ordered pop as I was driving and with daughter.  Had to wait for appetizers so finished the small glass of ice with tiny amount of pop, was informed they don't do refills and would only serve me another if I wad willing to pay.  Sorry but if you're going to be slow and serve such small expensive drinks, you should refill no problem!  Appetizer dips were OK but the stuffed grape leaves were not!  I have had much better from a can!  Daughters main course was shrimp linguine, pasta was dissolving in sauce from being over cooked (reheated?) and shrimp were hard and tasteless (overcooked).  My lamb souvlaki was way overcooked, chewy.( see overcooked) the potatoes tasted like they were at least four days old, rice was very dry and tasteless, salad was OK but uninspired ( wow romaine with feta crumbled on it)!  We ate less than half our plates, when waitress came to table we told her and she went away and told the guy in kitchen area just above our table and he just began muttering in Greek.  Bill was unadjusted for lousy food, will never return and recommend you go to Ali Babbas or some other fast food place rather than this place, food WILL be better!  Disappointing doesn't convey depth of our feeling.  Also, go with female companion to bathroom areas, they can't afford lights or light bulbs and was told by daughter she wad creeped out down there!  Actually just don't go there at all!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night with the family. We frequent Danforth Ave in Toronto (a Greek area but with LOTS of kinds of restaurants) and  wanted to try something new. Did not check ratings on Yelp - be warned

My spouse chose Pappas Grill based on looks (and looks can be deceiving)...

Good:
* Beautiful Restaurant - seated on the patio, great atmosphere. Patio chairs and table can be metal, but not metal grill types please...
* Wonderful atmosphere - nice patio, music not Greek but OK
* Seated quickly - almost as soon as we came through the door
* Staff OK/service had few issues but it was friendly and in most cases responsive

The OK:
* Food came quickly
* Allowed substitutions
* Wanted to charge for village vs Greek salad w/meal - this is a standard practice as tomatoes cost A LOT more than lettuce in Toronto esp, in winter months but even in summer
* Price was reasonable (about $70 for what we ordered - three mains and non-alco drinks).

The Bad:
* The food was BLAND (all three meals) - under spiced and unimaginative. Greek food can have wonderful flavours. Restaurant - do not be afraid to use them!
* The menu - there is more to Greek food than souvlaki, pasta (not Greek), Steak, and a few seafood dishes. Try making a real Greek \"signature dish\" restaurant people! 
* Ordered two substitutions on my meal (I do this everywhere), but only got one on my plate (of course did not charge for their error, and did offer to fix it but by then I was almost finished the other parts of my meal).
* Service issues: Trying to get the attention of the staff re the substitution issue took a while (in restaurant time going 10 minutes without being able to make eye contact with a server is \"a while\"). No- specials it seems - as we were not told about them.
* No imagination on the kids menu - yes some people with kids do go out to eat - if it's our family it is a lot of the time. To be fair this is not just true here, and they did let us split an order of the linguini for the kids

Would we return?  Maybe to try the brunch one day. Not for dinner - I am more about the food than the atmosphere.

What we had:
* Chicken Souvlaki
* Pasta Marinara 
* Linguini with Shrimp and Crab in Alfredo Sauce (split by the kids)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Went on my birthday on a whim to try it out as other local favourites were closed. Their saganaki is great, service is on point and they have a lovely patio!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it was ok, but somewhat uninspired. The bacon was limp and seemed like the ready made microwave type. The eggs were alright, but aside from the fruit skewer, the rest of the meal was medium. The price is good, but overall, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I've noticed the mixed reviews here so I'll list out what I ate and why I gave it the rating I did. We ended up at Pappas via our friends randomly walking on the Danforth and picking Pappas. 

Friday night patio time. Hey, when summer goes into mid-September, I'm going to take advantage of the patio weather we didn't get this summer. The patio is nice. It's on the side street and has the string lights. Service was enthusiastic. Although our waiter was taking care of a lot of tables, he was very energetic and personable at our table. We ordered appetizers and drinks and were very happy with the waiters recommendations. Apps consisted of Greek fries, the pepper dip (Tirokafteri), and bruschetta. All items were killer. Kudos to the waiter for the advice and to the chef. We had some house whites (avg) and on the waiters advice we then had the house greek wine. The greek wine was distinct and a nice touch to our awesome apps. The only thing I might deduct them for was the 11pm closing which ended our night a little earlier than expected. This is a new favorite for me. It's been Yelp bookmarked!"}
{"text":"My friend chose this place to meet up for a reunion dinner. Service was friendly and on par, the food was good but seemed overprice to me.

We started with saganaki, properly flamed. I had the roasted leg of lamb, and my friends had stuffed chicken and lamb souvlaki. Over all the dishes didn't feel authentic Greek. Instead it reminded me more of an American chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ugh. It's too bad the food isn't so great here. The restaurant itself is in a good location & looks lovely. It's got that old world charm going for it & a nice patio space. I had the salmon lunch which was a small piece of grilled salmon & a greek salad. My mom had the chicken with greek salad. Everything tasted fine. But not long after eating my stomach got really upset. Needless to say I won't be eating here again. Also the bathroom was kind of messy with paper towels strewn all over the floors. When we were leaving I let the host know & he said someone would take care of it. Also the service was fine. We didn't wait too long for the food & the waitress was really nice. Just the food didn't agree with me."}
{"text":"Went there on a friend's recommendation. Was nothing too special. Staff was nice but sometimes a big hard to get the attention of. The food was a bit bland but they have a large variety of sauces and I am pretty sure that is where you are supposed to get the taste from at least for most Greek food I've tried. The sauces were good so would suggest ordering a sauce to go with your dinner. If you ask nice (like we did) you can get extra sauce. 

Sauce, sauce, sauce... too bad I can't speak or name them or I would have. It's all Greek to me. HAHAHAHAHA... I'm done."}
{"text":"i'm not sure why this place has such a low review.

this was my first time coming here and i enjoyed it quite thoroughly. no complaints about the service and the food was great. i had a hard time finding parking but that's not even their fault.

i ordered the lamb souvlaki. i usually eat my steaks rare and didn't know how i should have the lamb. so i asked the waitress and she suggested i get the medium rare which ended up being perfect considering that lamb is gamey. it was seasoned very well, and had enough of that raw chewy texture that i love so much as opposed to the dry stringy well cooked texture.
along with the lamb souvlaki came rice, potatoes, greek salad, and tzatziki which all tasted delicious and had me leaving with a bit of garlic breath.

would come again on lamb souvlaki alone. yumm"}
{"text":"I am sad to say that this is a negative review.  I cannot rate lower than one star so my rating is actually too high.  I treated some dear friends to a dinner here and the waiter was extremely snotty and rude.  I was paying the bill and yet the waiter kept addressing the male at the table and never me.  My dish came last and it was oily and terrible (Moussaka which I do normally love).  I did not want to ruin my friends' evening so I did not say anything but I certainly will not return.  My previous concerns expressed to the restaurant about this at a later time went unanswered so their rating goes even lower for me.  Fortunately, there was several better options on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Not the best experience ever. We came during the long weekend, the hostess was walking around the patio for good 10 minutes to sit us down, even though it was pretty empty. She was really not the brightest and politest person. The waitress was ok in the beginning until she disappeared right after bringing us drinks. We waited for food for at least 30 minutes (again, the place was half empty), and then some different server brought us food, but not everything that we ordered. We had to call him again and explain what else we ordered. Finally some other lady came (assuming it was a manager) and asked us what exactly we ordered. Food is really mediocre, i would say 2 out of 5, everything is very salty, starting with souvlaki and ending with tzatziki. At the end we noticed other tables having complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic, so we decided to ask if we should have gotten one too. The answer was hilarious stating that \"it depends on what you order\". As a matter of fact we ordered two appetizers, two meals and drinks. By that time our initial server magically appeared and brought us bill. Bad service, mediocre food, nothing special. Go else where!"}
