{"text":"Ordered the snow chicken, toppoki and fries. The fries were almost as good as costco (which are my favorite fries), that was a good sign... The snow chicken was crispy and tasteful. The cheese powder tasted like the white cheddar powder from the smartfood popcorn - which I love - so another thumbs up. Finally, the topokki...the rice cakes were so chewy while the sauce had a mild spicy kick with a good warming taste. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Service and staffs were great! They give u some popcorn once u sit down when you are thinking of what to order~   Order an egg soup for my baby and it was great~  However since this place advertise their chicken, I was super disappoint with how dried the fried chicken was and the batter taste horrible~~"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was beyond my expectation!! I didn't even notice this place till today. It is pretty hard to notice, but I am so glad I found this place. Their chicken is so juicy and crisp. Their environment is pretty cozy too. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that loves chicken. Try their Buddae Jjigae too if you like spicy soup. It's BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small size of original take out. The chicken is crispy not dry at all. Staffs are friendly and kind. Prices are ok. Will definitely recommend this restaurant. And of course I will come back to try the snow chicken"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for those who are seeking to go out for a Korean Fried Chicken! We tried their soy garlic fried chicken, spicy cheese fire chicken and Ribs dipped in cheese and it was beyond our expectations. They taste better than any other chicken place in K town and even the price is cheeper than other pubs. We had a party of 10 and all the food plus four pitchers of beer and we only paid $25 per person. This is a perfect place for a decent chicken and beer for a decent price!"}
{"text":"We came here when my bf found out this place carries \"snow chicken\", and he wanted to try it. But I was thinking what the heck is snow chicken? He explains that this concept originated from Korea and it's pretty much fried chicken covered in cheese powder. So okay we go because I love cheese and fried chicken. It is directly below Cafe Bene btw.  We ordered a plate of snow chicken - 28.95. I think the food arrived after 10-15 minutes. Once I bit into the chicken, it was indeed crispy but I thought the chicken itself was a bit dry. You can definitely taste the cheese powder. After we finished, my bf noticed that there was no oil left on the paper from the basket and agreed that the chicken was a bit dry. He wondered if they had cooked it with an air fryer so who knows. Anyways, I would much prefer the kfc at other places. This one is meh. But if you want to try, then it's good to try once!"}
{"text":"I usually head over to Cheers Chicken and Beer at Yonge and Finch for KFC, but I decided to check out a place closer to my place (well, a few steps anyway!).  The establishment is downstairs in a multi-floor building.  As you step in, it is definitely a place for the young -- Kpop MVs playing on the television, some booth sitting and the rest were table seating.  The staff was friendly and was attentive when needed.  The food took a bit longer, but not too bad.  The chicken was hot and moist (cheaper than Cheers), but the chicken was doused in too much sauce; it made the dish very overwhelming for the palate.   Would I go here again? Probably not -- there was nothing about the establishment that would intrigue me go to back (especially when there are so many other Korean fried chicken places all around).  The price is good (especially when KFC is usually on the pricier side), but I rather pay a few more bucks and head over to the other restaurants around."}
{"text":"Tried their signature chicken wings; not only was it more expensive than the other local wings places, I was genuinely surprised by the bad quality, considering that wings was supposed to be their specialty. The wings here are literally fried chicken carcasses, imagine KFC chicken but with all the chicken meat shaved off before deep frying - there is barely any meat, only bones! Also, the wings was not served with fries or anything filling but instead replaced by small portions of diced radish and coleslaw. Needless to say, if you are looking for a wings night, avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Was going to go to Naniwa-Taro, but they're on vacation right now. Ended up coming here after a bit of walking because we saw their new management specials! I wanted to try their fourth special, which is 1lb of fried chicken, cheese buldak (spicy fire chicken with cheese) and budaejjigae (army stew) for $34.95, but it seemed like more food than the three of us could consume at that time, so we went with their second special, which was 1lb of fried chicken, corn cheese, and toppoki (spicy rice cakes) for $24.95. We did not get popcorn, but we did see another table that did.   The chicken was accompanied by small cubes of pickled radish, a small dish of coleslaw, and a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The chicken was crunch and juicy. Very tasty. The radish was refreshing. The coleslaw was lemony, but a tad too creamy for my liking. The cabbage was also slightly bitter. The sweet and spicy sauce was tasty, but I've had better. I'd order the chicken again though.   The toppoki was quite tasty. It comes with rice cakes, fish cake slices, cabbage, and lots of toppoki sauce. I would have liked the sauce to soak into the rice cakes a tad more, but I didn't mind having to spoon some of the sauce into my mouth along with the rice cake too much. I actually preferred the toppoki sauce on my fried chicken more than the sauce that originally came with the chicken. At $10.95 on their regular menu, I'd order this again too.  The cheese corn came in a shallow, flat pan, and had clearly been broiled. It was very hot. I believe there was some mayo mixed into the cheese and the corn. It was also very tasty. The corn was sweet, but not peaches and cream sweet. At $5.99 on the regular menu, this is quite a decent portion as well.   I don't know how much longer their new management special is going for, but I'd totally come again. I'm not sure about their regular chicken portions, as they come in small and large, and not in weight or pieces, so I can't say those prices are worth it, but their other food seems reasonably priced. Hurray for fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously for late night food-hopping with some friends on a Saturday night - it wasn't busy at all but we wanted to try it out since it was new. The chicken is amazing - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, very flavourful. The grapefruit soju is a classic, of course :)"}
{"text":"I love KFC so I've been to very many places. I would say the chicken here is quite standard. Not bad but not mind blowing. I wouldn't return here just for the chicken. - appetitzer was a small portion of picked raddish that was pink like beets - the fried scallops were perfectly done! So cripsy and hot on the outside while delightfully tender inside. - KFC was crunchy, wish it was a bit spicier. I dipped mine in the spicy rice cake sauce! - rice cakes: we asked for a topping of cheese. It was yummy - service was quick and the place had every seat full on Friday night!"}
{"text":"Got the take out half/half special.  Chicken was good, was not dry.  If it matters to people though, we discovered our chicken consists of 4 legs (no breast).  We happen to prefer dark meat so it was good for us."}
