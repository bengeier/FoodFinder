{"text":"I was here before an event at the arena and had a blast.  The Beer Cheese Dip was the BEST I have had in years.  The staff was fast and efficient.  I will stop here again the next time I am in town.  Overall, the section was outstanding.  Prices were low."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool good service. A little pricey but not that bad. Great outdoor patio set up for the summer. Worth going to and they have daily specials."}
{"text":"Fall menu is here! Craving chicken wings all week, so me and the BF came here for late lunch. Multiple rooms for seating. Self serve free popcorn. Service was fast. Actually quite busy for a late afternoon. We tried the chili tater tots, which can only be described as a large baked potato with a crunch. The jalape√±o peppers added a nice spicy kick! Could have used more chili. We asked for the sour cream on the side. We also tried the carribean and gold finger chicken wings. 2 five packs. Definitely worth the extra dollar for 2 flavors. The carribean was alittle dry, but the complimentary ranch or bleu cheese dip solved that problem. Overall a full meal for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Gotta love the lizard.  32 oz beers for 4 bucks.  Also one of the first places open and one of the last places to close in the neighborhood.  I love the food and it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Lizard's management appears consistently to value the benefits is keeping their draft beer lines pristinely clean - that and their attitude towards reasonably priced draft beer specials will keep any aficionado supremely happy. If you're a beer fan in general the more than 100 bottle list will keep you fluid.  Food wise, the burgers are the best around at the price; wings are NOT up to Anchor Bar in Buffalo standard by any imaginative stretch, but locally, again, are hard to beat.  As a plus, the service staff is the most professional in this class of restaurant you're likely to find anywhere and aside from the to be expected occasional malcontents a great group of actual professionals. Enjoy! By the way, the current manager, Kevin, obviously beloved by his staff, is either moving on to better and better venues or the top management of the L understands his professionalism and is clearly promoting him!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch because of the convenient location and it is a local chain so we wanted to support it. Pros - the place was clean, the servers were nice and enthusiastic. The food was pretty bad, the salads REALLY BAD. I guess this is a great place for wings and beer, so I would stick to foods that are fried. The french fries were DELICIOUS, the chicken sandwich okay. I was expecting the food to be better than the regular Lizard. Keep your expectations low and your beverage glass full."}
{"text":"Really good bar food. Spicy garlic wings are my favorite thing here. Beer selection is top notch. Patio is really great as well as the overall atmosphere. Only complaint is the consistently rude staff."}
{"text":"This is the third Winking Lizard that I have visited and until now they were great. This is the WORST bar service I've ever seen. 5 minutes until one of three bartenders decided to ask if I wanted something to drink. I'm sitting at the bar....That was 15 minutes ago. I'm hungry, would love to order some food but apparently these guys are WAY too busy serving the 7 other people at the bar. I'm leaving as soon as this beer is gone. So, I decide to stay and see if things improved and get some food. Food was great! Service continued to be terrible. My bill included someone else's food. Bartender Scott said it was for my friend, strangely enough the ticket didn't reflect what he ordered and they billed him also! I was gonna add a star or two based on the food but now I want to take the 1 away"}
{"text":"Corn beef sandwich on St. Patrick's day  was weak sauce.   No mustard, swish cheese.  Dry, chewey and bread tasted straight out a bag.  Yuck.  Oh yeah.  It's now officially a Winking Lizard restaurant.   Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"I love the Winking Lizard Tavern, so many varieties beers, wings, and other yummy things. The atmosphere is good for families to eat or a night out, it's flexible like that. Lots of TVs, so if you gotta catch the game, don't worry, they got your back. They have a touchtune machine so you can feel like a D.J. for the night too. Friendly staff.  Now for what you folks are dying to know: What is the coleslaw like?  I have to rate Winking Lizard's coleslaw a solid ten. It's perfectly tangy, sweet, and quite refreshing! Not too crunchy, not too soft, justttt right.   So folks, if good beers and wings don't make you want to come here, try the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Terrible and expensive Asian salad. Thrown together with awful ingredients! Will never order a salad again!"}
{"text":"Got in town later than expected and everything by my hotel was just starting to close (9:45) so I didn't have many options. I've been here one other time and had a decent enough experience so I thought why not... Well the there were zero seats at the bar because of the Cavs game and the restaurant was packed!! Anyway, after not finding a seat I asked the hostess to be seated. Then the wait started... Literally twenty five minutes went by and not one single employee came to my table. I even had everything picked out so that once the waitress came for my drink order I could speed things up by getting my food as well but I never had the opportunity. I literally sat and watched time and said to myself I was leaving if nobody came by 10:35. And nobody came..... Won't be back."}
{"text":"Our waitress flicked us off and threw a glass against the wall and got in a screaming fight with the manager. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with friends and grab a drink. Wings are pretty good but may be just a Tad overrated. Good selection of beers on draft."}
{"text":"One of my fav Winking Lizard spots. The staffs are very friendly and kind. The place is  kinda dimmed but that is with all winking lizard spots. Great beer selection. Amazing beer drinks and food specials. Wings are amazing. Fries are great especially the preffered fries and their bo man burger is the bESt! I eat here at least once a week or even twice. I love the place..love the food..love the setting!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful margaritas and the wings were no better.... The atmosphere is good but that's about it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here based on urban reviews we found this place is a great recommendation and we were very satisfied! Food, beers n service was great."}
{"text":"The hubbs and I enjoyed the blue cheese burger and wings, as well as, sharing the preferred fries. My husband requested all flats for the wings and even though it wasn't \"wing day\" he was accommodated. The food was excellent. Service was slow even though the place wasn't full. That's the only reason this did not rate five stars. We will be back."}
{"text":"Today I went to the winking Lizard for lunch with my Husband and we walked into an empty restaurant and waited at the host stand to be seated as the sign said to do. A guy walks by and tells the host/server there are people at the door. My husband and I wait a few more minutes and watch everybody do anything but come to seat us and we finally decided to seat ourselves. After we took our seats a server hurried to the table and asked where we would like to be seated (bar/patios/etc.) as if we hadn't just selected our seats already. But we let it slide. Eventually she takes our order and doesn't write anything down. And then come back and has to retake our order and this time she writes it down. We wait for what seems an hour for a chicken quesadilla, a chicken sandwich, and a wedge salad. Anytime she checked on our table it was only in passing as if in this nearly deserted restaurant she was to busy to give us any attention. Good customer service is a must"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times, and it's always crowded so be patient if you don't get there early enough.  Lots of televisions to distract you if you don't like the company you're with.  The food is tasty, good portions, and every wait person we've ever had has been great.  Definitely a place that's value for money."}
{"text":"Great place. Bartender was very nice and helpful. Huge selection of beers and decent crab cakes."}
{"text":"Back visiting Cleveland after over two years and can't believe I never came here before even though I came to Coventry fairly often.  Super beer selection (I had a vanilla flavored porter bottled beer -- think it was number 17 -- that was excellent), good and  cheap $5 small cheese pizza special plus extra for toppings, great server with crazy long hair,  great popcorn, lots of tvs, and cute girls. I think sitting in the bar at the back/inside right is best in case you had a bad experience up front."}
{"text":"First visit at this location. Parking isn't great but once inside, nice layout and atmosphere. Our wait wasn't long for a Saturday night. Our order, a burger/fries and a salad took a little too long to come out though. I had the Mesa Chop Salad which was good, nice proportion. My bf's burger on the other hand, was extremely dry. We'll try again soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Winking Lizard for who knows how long....I just really love it.  It's really good bar food (I especially love their wings and house salad) and a HUGE selection of beer.    And they have the World Tour of Beer....you drink 100 beers over a years time and then you get prizes.  It's great if you are a beer lover.  My dad and I did it together one year and it was a great bonding experience.    Just a great local feeling bar (they have expanded a lot, but it still feels local to me).  My bf even flew me back to Cleveland just to take me there because I love it soooo much!"}
{"text":"This is a decent stop for a beer and a burger.  As others have said, it's a chain, nothing exciting, but dependable.  As others have also said, the main minus is the crowd.  This place fills up fast and you may have to stand around and wait for a while or take an uncomfortable seat at a too-small bar if you're in a bit of a hurry and want to have a quick bite.  The people who go here tend to be loud sports-bar types and unlike other bar areas, such as Lakewood on the West Side, there's not too many places on Coventry for them to go, so they're all going to jam in here.  Add in the family/ friends dinner crowd and you've got one loud, overcrowded, uncomfortable little restaurant.    I normally don't mind eating while sitting at a bar, as I'm often eating by myself while waiting for friends, waiting for doors to open for a show nearby, etc., but I do mind when the guy next to me practically has his elbows in my french fries because there's just no space.   They really need to expand the size of this joint or maybe offer takeout for the food.  Next time I'm just going to ask for a box for my sliders and take them out to the benches on the corner up the street.    The Lakewood Winking Lizard is preferable to this one simply because it's larger and in a slightly less trafficked area, making for less of an overcrowding problem."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the food or service. They had  a \"security\" person at the door requiring my (I'm over 60) ID before I could enter the restaurant. Looking at it in my wallet wasn't enough. He wanted it out. Trying to aggravate customers?"}
{"text":"The beer is pretty good, but the food is somewhat lacking.  Nice feel overall."}
{"text":"Seated quickly despite a huge crowd (Cavs playoff game!) but then, unfortunately, ignored by all the waiters and managers bustling around. When I finally asked a manager if they could get us a waiter, he did, reasonably quickly.  The waiter was busy but friendly and told us that the manager said the first round was on him, which was a nice surprise. Because we just stopped in for dessert (which was served quickly) while catching the end of the game, when it came time to leave, the waiter told us it was all taken care of; again, a nice surprise.  A minor slip-up, in retrospect, and handled graciously."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is kind of a Cleveland area staple.  I recently visited the Lakewood location for the first time, and it was business as usual.  I love a good beer list, and you pretty much can't go wrong here.  I was very excited to see that Founder's Breakfast Stout was on draught, however I was there late-ish on 10-31 and was informed that it was a November draught pick, so I couldn't get one that night.  Looks like I'll back for some of that!  People, you have to try this stout...it's that good.    The food was fine.  I don't do a lot of meat (really any, except for the occasional sushi), so I was happy to see a few veg options.  I got the portabella sandwich and was to see that all the veggies on it were grilled (instead of fried as I might have expected).    I should also mention that the atmosphere here is way cooler than that of most of the locations.  You can tell that it has some history, which I love.  Overall Winking Lizard is a-ok, and I will be back for the Breakfast Stout...possibly on more than one occasion!"}
{"text":"Can't say terrible service because we didn't have any service. Told hostess after waiting awhile. Still nothing. Left after 15 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"Was in town recently for business and ended up making Winking Lizard my go to spot for the week. Great selection of beers and whiskey, everything I ate was great and the staff was incredibly friendly!! I definitely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I went with a few coworkers for lunch today around 1145. First, I had to specify that outside seating meant outside seating. Like outside in the open air not outside in the galleria. Then we had to wait 45 minutes for our food and for lunch, that is ridiculous. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Well, whatever came out of the chicken was NOT buffalo chicken. It tasted completely off. The cheese was wasn't melted and in fact, we all thought it was rice, not cheese. Then instead of diced tomatoes like the menu description said, there were huge sun-dried tomatoes on it. Totally disgusting on a buffalo chicken wrap. I had to send it back bc it didn't taste right. I was eventually brought another one that tasted equally horrible. No one checked in with our table once to see how the food was.  And we had to wait 20 min for our checks. Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard TAVERN - apparently this \"restaurant\" only allows patrons 21 and older entrance after 5 pm unless accompanied by an adult. Unfortunately my daughter and her boyfriend (17) drove 30 minutes in a snowstorm to celebrate an anniversary. Imagine their disappointment when they were asked for their ID's and then offered the carry out menu.  Seriously?  The Winking Lizard should NOT be called a restaurant if they discriminate and are unable to \"police\" their customers - every other restaurant in existence seems to be able to serve customers of all ages without discriminating.   I'm happy to spread the word and help the Winking Lizard Tavern let people know that they're not interested in being a restaurant but rather a TAVERN/BAR ....."}
{"text":"Yelp people--why have you removed my reviews? Here's what I posted two weeks ago, minus the gripes about management:  Not sure why the cranky reviews about service, as I have had good to excellent service here 90% of the time. I have not had a bad experience here and usually enjoy myself (and the food). It's bar food, dude; a local chain that makes pretty good (but maybe not great) food. I do have a few gripes: no hot water in the restrooms, towel dispensers are set to deliver 4\" long mini's, an extra charge if you need extra salad dressing or dare to want visible sauce on your wings--which are otherwise very good, BTW and $0.40 on Mon and Tues evenings.   However, gripes aside: Like good beer? An excellent selection here, including lots of microbrews and worldwide offerings, and the staff usually know whereof they speak when explaining their offerings. Add there is usually free fresh popcorn (and I disagree with the guy who said it sucked--I have it every week and it's fine).  Some very friendly servers (e.g. Cindy), and they take pretty good care of you, and if you go every week as I do they remember your name. They used to have the best Lake Erie Perch sandwich in town; I hope they bring it back.  I recommend the burgers and other sandwiches, and the salads are fine (though the Original House is overpriced, it's very good). They have some excellent dressings; I recommend the LaFlora Italian. Contrary to other reviews, I've rarely had trouble with my food, and when i occasionally did they made it right. It can be loud when it's busy, and it can be very busy on the weekends and big sports days. Follow the specials and you'll get some really good deals. And I have to give them credit for offering more than standard pub fare--they offer new dishes regularly and have quite a good-sized menu.  All in all, it's pretty good bar food with a great beer selection and friendly capable people on the premises . Free wifi that works and a good jukebox, too. Like sports? TV's everywhere, bub. Like to show the kids a big ol' live lizard that has its own TV? Got it here, though the kids might be a bit freaked to discover that the only Tv tuned to the Cartoon Channel is in the lizard's terrarium (though he's a friendly vegetarian guy despite his appearance, and moves at 1 mph max).  PS--this location is in a strip mall and lots of the parking spots are reserved for the stores, so park carefully. Pretty small patio but with a great view of parked cars--for the smokers and diehard sunseekers I'm guessing."}
{"text":"I love Winking Lizard-- great beers, good food.  Wednesday rib night can't be beat."}
{"text":"A huge place. Quickly seated on a Friday night. Family friendly sports bar. A couple of vegetarian options. Huge beer selection. Recommended by a local traffic cop as a good place for a quick quality meal. He was right!"}
{"text":"Would leave 0 stars if I could. Service is terrible, went to the check in desk and no one was there for 5 plus minutes. Decided to go to the bar and bar tender didn't want to serve us... She asked us to go back to the check in desk to get a table. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"when cleveland will have a wing? I mean a nice wing  I am traveling a lot and winking lizard or buffalo wild wing are not really great wing at all and I dont find any nice wing around cleveland  bottom to top nothing I can find I wanna spend my penny on these dishes here  I wish we can have something like bonchon chicken (from NYC boston and DC area) I would love to go there every week to eat drink and watch my sports!!"}
{"text":"This is great place to go watch a game,drink,eat, or all three. I been over there 5 times already . Great outdoor patio with the fire pit."}
{"text":"This week is lobster Mac special week. I order it for lunch it, amazing! Plan to go again before Sat. Five stars, only for lobster Mac. (Ps: not on the menu, check online):)"}
{"text":"I am so very disappointed overall with the winking lizard company. I have been going to different locations over ten years now and the food has been getting worse and worse! If I could give negative stars I would.   Service is pretty good. The people try to take care of customers as best they can, especially with large parties in the downtown location. The phone service is horrible, they should probably not have rude employees answer phones anymore.  The bar is split in two and has two entrances, which is nice for parking on both streets. The bar is large and has a good beer selection. However, I think they need to remodel. Every place especially the downtown location looks old and dirty. The bathroom at the time was a disgusting mess, and not one employee did anything about it.    The worst part is the food. The execution of the dishes is horrible. I was with a party of 7 two days ago. Our orders ranged from chicken wings, chicken buffalo wraps, burgers and sandwiches. Overall- bad.   On top of everything the potion size is small and the price is expensive for the amount of food and quality. \"Pound\" of boneless and a \"pound\" of regular chicken wings with a water a fries was 18$!!!!! That was over 1.00$ per wing and they were bad! The fries were not hot and soggy.   Besides the bad food, the nickle and dime approach with sauces and dips is quite upsetting. I will never step foot in any winking lizard location."}
{"text":"First, I want to say that it has been a few years since I lived in Cleveland.  I used to go to the Winking Lizard often when I was back in graduate school and loved it.  I recently had the opportunity to visit Cleveland and before heading over to watch the Browns game, took my son for lunch.  He and I were not disappointed.  My son loved the hot wings and burger and I really liked the Turkey melt.  The service was terrific and the manager of the Lizard helped me out in a big way with an item that I lost.  Needless to say, it was good to see the Lizzard has not lost its touch!  If you are in Cleveland and looking for a really good value and great customer service, go to the Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"Although the location is great in downtown  Cleveland, the service on a game day has much to be desired. One half hour after arriving the order was finally taken. Additionally, the requested game was not put on a TV until after it had started and was requested a half dozen times. Aside from that the food was good."}
{"text":"went there a couple times. Wings r Da good. Make sure u try the sesame sauce it's mild and savory, adding a lot of flavor to your wings."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent selection of sporting events on a vast array of televisions, the best beer selection at any bar in Cleveland!  Great view of the Cleveland skyline from the bar area.  This is the best place to go after work with co workers or to meet up with friends.  I've been going to the Lizard for over 15 years"}
{"text":"Stopped in planning to have a full meal, however just had an app and a beer.  Our server was not friendly. She acted as she did not want to be there  and not very helpful with the menu.  Our nachos were very onion heavy.  Very good beer selection. However that is available be at many places now a days that are cleaner, better service and better food."}
{"text":"Oh no this wasn't how I watched the Super Bowl ! Oh but yes it was. I met 20 of my family members Sunday to watch the Super Bowl and it was...annoying...we were not allowed to reserve space so we sat knocking into the customers behind us and could barely move, not that the place was crowded...just the tables and chairs. I am not that pickey however my daughter and I ordered take out and it came well before our meal which was just strange. Apparently the waitress was upset because the 20 of us ordered 3 whole separate checks. It was apparent because she would roll her eyeballs when we asked. Typically the winking lizards are family and children friendly however this location is hotel friendly only. I really don't think anyone was even there to watch the Super Bowl. Unless people watch it in complete silence. The south side has many more fun places to be and this is not one of them.  The food was okay..actually the specials were the best and I think the chef must be excellent. If only the rest of the staff was. A kitchen person came to me and told me my children were shaking the pricey game machines and they needed to stop. My children were not near them. In fact my teenaged children never left the table.  The beer was good however they do not make the beer.  I spent a lot of money and I love to spend money- just not when I'm squashed like a sardine for no apparent reason and the staff don't enjoy thier job at all. I have been a server and you at least have to smile once or twice it's called hospitality. Lol!  Maybe we should have drank more-  Or maybe the staff should act happy-  There are so many great places to enjoy food and have a good time just skip this one!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Me and my girl got seated than we sat around and waited for almost 30m before a waiter came to our table. Then the place was almost empty at that. Will not be coming back anytime soon. Forgot about the waiters walking by our table like we didn't exist. Food was descent! The waitress we had was very nice and efficient."}
{"text":"4 stars for the bar (tvs and bar)  3 for the food.  To start, we are from Northern Ky and drive to Cleveland for the Browns games.  This is a regular stop for us to make sure we pick up the glass of the month.  (Seriously, how many souvenir glasses does a man REALLY need?)  This place has a great selection of beers and cocktails.  The bar area is perfect for football and the service is friendly and attentive.    For me, the food is just okay.  The bf loves the bbq chicken dinner.  Maybe I need to suck it up and order bar food instead of trying to keep it healthy with a salad or wrap...?  Next time we are going to try the pretzel appetizer.  Patio looks awesome, may have to check it out when it gets warmer..."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is a great place to enjoy appetizers, a few drinks, and watch a game or whatever's on TV.  I have fond memories of watching the Olympics late at night while sharing food with family there.  The wings are great, and with the weekly deals they have, you can try a variety of flavors on their list without guilt (many aren't as spicy as they advertise)."}
{"text":"I love going to Winking Lizard for their weekly specials -- the deals on personal pizzas and wings are great.  While the wings often aren't as spicy as I might expect them to be from their heat chart, most of the flavors are very tasty and it's fun to get a variety.  With a few wings and a small pizza of your choice (I like adding chicken and artichoke), you can have a great, inexpensive meal.  Their drink selection is also fun and extensive.  It's a nice place for everyone, whether you're sitting down for a family meal or heading for the bar."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening, the place wasn't even half full, not a good sign but we really like Winking Lizard and wanted to give Winks a try.  We were a little confused as far as what the concept was supposed to be, so I asked our server. She said it was a classier, upscale version of the Lizard restaurants. We didn't really see it. Other than a few different food items, a bourbon list, and minus the popcorn stand, it wasn't different enough. It still had a very casual feel, there were televisions and memorabilia all over the walls, and sandwiches and burgers dominated the menu. The food was pretty good, until I found a hair in mine. Our server apologized, asked if I wanted a replacement, I declined because we had to get home. She took my item off the bill and said the manager apologized, but he never personally came to the table. We will continue to patronize the Lizard, but won't be back to Winks."}
{"text":"wings were delicious, beer selection was unreal, service was fast!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Winking Lizard for seven years and keep going back regularly for one reason: Beer.  Rotating draft selections keep variety and I've never had a beer that wasn't fresh and the right temperature.  If your looking for margaritas and five star meals than I don't recommend it.  But if you're looking for great beer and good bar food then this is the place."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but the service has completely gone down hill. Twice now they've forgotten part of my order, and the waiters completely disappear during the whole meal (can't even ask about the missing items). Is one refill for my water too much to ask for during my meal?! I'm currently waiting on a take out that is 30 min past due.  I love the food, but the service is some of the worst ever!"}
{"text":"Kind of a cross between sports bar and a dive bar. Service was good but seemed pretty drab on the interior.  The beer list is over overwhelming, extensive list of bottles and drafts. The food left little to be desired."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Coventry for food and casual, fun hang outs. They have an excellent beer selection (over 100); between this and La Cave du Vin there are very few beers you can't find in Coventry.   Food is great too. The Wink is well known fro their wings(go for Goldfinger flavor) and if it's a special that night, they are only $.40! Pizza and burgers are also tasty, especially when paired with an appropriate beer from their massive selection.  Service isn't bad, but can be awful slow in large groups or when things get really busy. If you can, find a seat at the bar and enjoy their ubiquitous televisions from there!"}
{"text":"Love the new patio expansion and beer room downstairs. Always fast services and good place to catch football on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, beers. Tuesday night wing night for me, however, will be spent at the more-expensive-but-far-more-worth-it-if you want superior wings BW3 (60 cent versus 50 cent) I'l try a different app in the future"}
{"text":"Great food (ribs), great beer (GLBC) and friendly staff. Love this place! Loads of tvs, and a simple and delicious menu. Perfect place to watch the NCAA tournament."}
{"text":"There isn't a whole lot of good places in this area to grab a decent bite to eat as well as getting a good quality beer.  The Lizard satisfies both of these needs.  The food isn't the best you'll ever have, but it's good.  The beer selection is extensive!  I've never had bad service here and I've been here a lot.  There is a large patio to enjoy the nice weather when you can, and a skeeball league which sounds pretty fun!"}
{"text":"Winking Lizard in Coventry has consistently terrible service.  I love the beer selection, the wing specials, the popcorn, and of course Jalapeno the iguana.  I even completed the beer tour there, dropping a substantial chunk of cash there once a week.  I'm a waitress of the past - I will always tip 20% and understand a crowd (usually the case at the Lizard.)  HOWEVER, despite my loyalty and stupid jacket, I refuse to walk through those doors again and will whine to anyone who says \"Coventry\" about it.  The servers and management need better training or at least to be mildly friendly.  You need to ask for silverware EVERY TIME, ask if you can order, ask if you can have a refill, ask if you can ever, ever, EVER get your check.  When you get boneless wings instead of regular, there is no chance the server will be able to correct his/her mistake.  I guess this is a crescendo effect - I let this build up over a year of wonderful, overpriced beers.    Beaver is the best server in town.  She should start training everyone there."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and I came into this place on a Sunday night to watch the game and grab a beer and some wings, I like this place!  The beer selection was awesome, the wings were great with a nice variety of flavors and the staff was pretty cool too. I will definitely pay another visit to this place if I ever hit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"Only go when a man named Daryl is there. I repeat. Only go when he is there. Good luck having a server that knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service. Even the food was great but tasting it again two hours later... not so great. Definitely got food poisoning."}
{"text":"Nice new building. I sit at the bar when I come and the service has always been on the slow side. Everyone is nice enough and the food equals the other locations."}
{"text":"Seems to have a regular 5: bar crowd mixed with out of Towners sent for a quick local bite from various hotels.  Big menu, pretty standard choices you'd expect from a place called Winking Lizard...wings, quesadillas, wraps etc.  nothing stood out yet nothing was bad.   I really wanted a whacked out Hunter S. Thompson experience considering the name of the place but all I got was the John Taffert sports bar special."}
{"text":"Since I just turned 21, I had never been inside the Wink other than to pick up my favorite Spicy Garlic Wings until last night.  Although all I have ever had from there is their wings, they are great.  The only thing that sort of sucks about this place is they are sort of stingy.  You ask for Blue Cheese with your wings, and they bring you one, tiny little container of it, barely enough for 6 wings, if you ask for another one, you are charged for it.  I just feel that that is not necessary.  The beer list was pretty good, they had a lot of nice bottles and a fairly good tap list.  I did like the vibe overall and the place is HUGE.  I will be back a lot and think I will probably grow to love it more and more."}
{"text":"This new Winking Lizard is so great. We've been here three times since it opened. Three different waitresses and five stars for all three! Host staff- same! Food is always good too.   The only thing lacking was the manager on duty Thursday night. We wanted to give some feedback about how my burger was cooked (made it clear that we didn't want any money off, but is was too rare) and the manager came over and said \"did we order medium rare? do we know what rare is? Do we know that some restaurants define medium rare differently? So, do we know for next time?\"  I'm not down with the schoolmarm thing, but lesson #1 was missed: the customer is always right."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for work and heard great things about this place! Lots of different Types of beer, and their wings were incredible! I also had the Macaroni bites, which were pretty stinkin' tasty! It was a great place with good food and good service. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area. There are tons of locations nearby also."}
{"text":"When you're hooked you're hooked! When you're wife thinks of the Lizard first when she doesn't want to cook you've found your home base! The beer of course is the big draw!!!  The tour gives purpose to drinking beers from all over the world (as if one needs any).  The jackets, the hoodies, the glass of the month, the other perks, it's an addiction!  But who cares. Food is mostly okay, but there are a few really good selections such as Southwest Eggrolls, the chop salad, the burgers, and my friends tell me the wings are exceptional (I guess so, I don't like wings account of an emotionally scaring experience eating the wolds worst wings at Hooters many years ago).  Oh, and the seasonal beer cheese dip and Irish pizza!!! The WL Conference Room ;-) is the site of many an impromptu \"staff meeting\" plus is it even possible to go to a Cavs or Indians game without a stop at the Lizard?!?!"}
{"text":"If you travel to this area for business please avoid this place. The service was absolutely the worst I have ever seen in my life. Nice to the locals but if they don't know you they pretty much ignore you. food was o.k. except the big boneless wings were about the size of a tater tot with the classy cup of ranch like you would get from Domino's with the lid still intact.  The knife I was using was missing a rivot as the blade wobbled back and fort. And for entertainment I got to kill the half dead fruit flu buzzing around on top of the bar.  I was just looking for food and a game but again have never experienced such poor service. Like I was the invisible man. The bartender didn't say thanks nothing when I asked for the check just out it down in front of me and walked away. that was our only interaction after I ordered my food. Not a how's your food etc nothing.  Needless to say won't be back there anytime in this lifetime and I suggest you run too."}
{"text":"Excellent service we loved our waitress Erica Dewitt. Had to cheeseburger special and a delicious cocktail Lucy sexy lizard for two excellent."}
{"text":"They will overcharge you and bring the wrong food out to you late, then bring the right food out to you after your whole party has gotten their checks. Pretty sure their pizza is just Digiorno...no, Digiorno is better. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great new patio.....almost triples their outdoor seating.....and as always...great taps!!!!  My husband and I go on Thursdays because they have a cheeseburger special and we can always get a great draft"}
{"text":"The winking lizard was a nice joint, with pretty good wings. We were there after 11 pm, so they had like 32 oz beers and cheap wings. The wings were on the smaller side, compared to what I've found elsewhere.   Our service was great (it was pretty slow).   I would recommend going back."}
{"text":"I would be happy to never go to the Wink again. but I like being social, and being in school, I get dragged there for wing night, when food is so cheap students can't say no.   But this is it. No more greasy, expensive fried food that isn't even any good. Done. Good bye Wink - you never had any of the beers you said you had, anyhow.  (it has been pointed out to me by many friends that perhaps I'm too harsh with my one star rating. It's true that there's nothing outright terrible about the Wink. And they do seat large groups, and the food is often 'average'. I've also had generally better experiences at other Wink chains. So don't not go, just on my word. But, for me, sometimes mediocrity really is a one-star.)"}
{"text":"I ate here for the third time yesterday. The burgers are always the best! I tried the Strip steak yesterday, not the best. I asked for med-rare and it came out med to med-well. The flavor was good, but over cooked. Great service, fair prices, more beersthan you can handle! Try a burger!"}
{"text":"Winks is winks. Come here for good beer and great TV for sports. I wouldn't come here for dinner or anything, but it is one of the better sports bar I have been to."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great!  I visited while home for the holidays and had awesome service.  Food was spot-on and the inside was very clean.  The TV set up at the bar would make viewing any sporting event very positive.  I will be back while in Cleveland in 2015."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland, place is close to the hotel and needed a beer and a place to work after being on the road all day. The patrons seemed to be having fun but I would probably not return, servers seemed to be inconvenienced by orders :)"}
{"text":"Food was fine (reuben sandwich), but takeout service awful.  The two women behind the check-in/pickup counter looked up 4 times at me then went back to their important conversation.  You'd think the takeout bag would come with a napkin and plastic ware. Also, no ketchup to go with the steak fries.  Just basic service was absent."}
{"text":"Great staff and service, quality food and prices, we're regulars."}
{"text":"Good food as expected from our previous meals at the Winking Lizard. However, a member of our party wanted a non-alcoholic beer...and we couldn't believe that with the extensive beer list they didn't stock Beck's or St. Pauli N.A.!! Please note that diet cola isn't nearly as good with wings as beer is!"}
{"text":"There are a dozen or so Winking Lizards in the Cleveland area, but this one has a special charm. The building use to be an old tennis club and then turned into a Elk Lodge, and then a Winking Lizard. The inside is huge, and the bar can seat plenty of beer goers.  I went on a Monday evening around 7pm or so. It had decent traffic but it was not to the point were you had to wait to be seated or for someone to leave the bar. The stand out feature of Winking Lizard is their incredible beer list. About 200 beers you can choose from. You can join their World Tour of Beer, which is about 10 bucks for the membership and you get a book explaining each beer on the list and a rating a guide so you can rate the beers you like or do not like.  Their food is good, but nothing special, typical American bar food, wings, burgers, sandwiches. Monday and Tuesday are their wing nights. On a typical wing night at restaurants you get the worse wings possible, but these wings were great, plenty of flavors to pick from, they are juicy and fresh. Definitely  a must try here.  The hostess and the bartenders are great. Friendly and knowledgeable, everything you need to complete the experience. If you are looking for a bar/restaurant with a great beer list and great atmosphere you should definitely true out Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"Everything about the place is so-so.   Just like every other sports bar in the gateway district. Food is overpriced and generally boring. Nothing inspiring or charming about the atmosphere.  Take 10 steps down Huron for a slightly more inspired, sports centric experience at City Tap."}
{"text":"Awesome pub and grill! Had several beers here, but there are sooooo many more to try! It is a challenge and If i lived in OH, I would accept!  Food is decent. Great place to relax and watch some sports with my dad!"}
{"text":"Been there twice- sat at outside bar. Service was terrible, but the food is pretty good. Beer and 5 big screens are best part!"}
{"text":"They have suuuuuch a huge beer list, but aren't great at updating it - they were out of two of the beers I ordered. Still pretty good though, and a fun place to stop by and sit outside in summer."}
{"text":"Your typical sports bar.  They have a lot of tvs but I don't remember seeing any HDTV's.  Fried food and some of it is decent.  They have a lot of beer. Unusual beer is the special here and they are the main supplier of some of the lesser knowns.  All of the Winking lizards are in interesting buildings as the d-town on is a corner building."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for lunch. Consistently good food. Must get there early for lunch to beat the business crowd. Can get loud. It wont blow you away, but given my local options, its a solid choice. I especially like the steak/asparagus salad, wings and burgers. Yum."}
{"text":"Will not be my last visit! This place had great food, an awesome drink selection, and an iguana-what else could you want? The service is spot on, everyone is attentive and friendly. The food comes out in a timely fashion and is priced just right! They have monthly and daily specials. I will be a repeat consumer for sure :)"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Even though it wasn't crowded, had to wait to order and waited forever for the check. Food is decent, but the service is abysmal...skip this place!"}
{"text":"Very limited vegetarian dishes. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about here.  I have always had a love hate relationship with the Lizard.  Basically my time is enjoyable if I don't eat their food.  Never once have I had a good meal.  The boneless wings are pretty good, but everything else is baaaaaaad.  When the pizza came out I couldn't help but laugh.    They do have a wonderful selection of beers from around the world.  This is the only reason they get 3 stars.  Each month they have a 32 ounce draft special that is something like 4 bucks.  Good place to watch the Cavs games if you care about the NBA."}
{"text":"Great local/sports restaurant. Was a Winks, but is now a standard Winking Lizard (which is better). HUGE craft beer list. Wings are always great. Try the spicy sesame or the spicy BBQ wing sauces. And their house Italian dressing is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the winking lizard they do a great job, food and beer is always excellent.  Welcome to mayfield."}
{"text":"OK. This has to be WLT's smallest location. Often too crowded. They have a huge beer selection and a bunch of TV's so that is most likely the draw. The food is OK. Standard for a pub. I gave 2 stars because it's just to crowded too often. But for it being so busy the wait staff is good... so if you are willing to wait for a seat and handle a crowd it could be worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of sports bars, but this place is different -- and not just because of the iguana.  Food is good, beer selection great, enough flat-screens scattered around to cover any sports worth watching, nice patio for spring, summer, fall (not sure if it's heated?). Can be a bit noisy at times, especially in the bar.  Popcorn machine over by the door - help y'self."}
{"text":"Not a great place. 8 of us came over from an Indians game and we were told we wouldn't be served. This is coming from a guy who is currently driving home. Had two beers at the game. The female manager thought we had too much to drink. Gave the server $20 because he literally said \"I'm not sure what her problem is, you guys are perfectly fine and the other (male) manager said your guys are fine to drink\". He got a tip for doing nothing but being a decent person, the same as we should all be."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this little tavern while in Cleveland.  Overall, I found the food to be average, the atmosphere to be timid, and the service left me wanting more. The beer selection is large, so if you are looking for a bar with food options, this might be your place.  If you are looking for a place with awesome food, you may want to try a different option."}
{"text":"I came here for the world series game. I ordered a beer when they lost and 5 minutes later they said they were closing and had to take my beer. I spent $7 on that beer and drank two sips. They should've told me the bar was closing or I shouldn't buy a beer . Waste of money and so rude especially during such an exciting time in Cleveland. I say DO NOT GO TO WINKING LIZARD"}
{"text":"First but hopefully not last visit. Really unique place, and massive selection of beer, and bourbons. Enjoyed some laughs with friends over a flight of various aged Irish blends. Very nice."}
{"text":"We came here after the Indians game, and we didn't have to wait for a table or decent service.  I was pretty impressed.  Our waitress was informative of specials and quickly got us a pitcher of beer.  The food was pretty decent for bar food, and what we really appreciated was that as they were closing down the section we were seated in, they were still serving us drinks and telling us to take our time.  It took us a while for 2 people to finish a pitcher.  Anyhow, I think I would go back again after a game."}
{"text":"Can't beat the deals for wings on mon and tues nights. They also have a good selection of beer. Holly even gave me and my bro a free beer after she took mine by mistake."}
{"text":"Tuesday night wing special was pretty solid. $0.50 cents, lots of flavors. Definitely recommend. Service was mediocre, but just deliver my wings and I am ok.  I enjoyed the spicy garlic the best, probably better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  Also had ribs, a little dry. Just stick with the wings."}
{"text":"Worst ribs I have ever eaten, very undercooked...I could hardly get the meat off the bones. Cook your RIBS please..."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience, gave it a second chance and wished I didn't. Horrible service horrible customer service... Just plain horrible. I've never in my life given a bad review, but actually felt the need to do it this time... Did I mention fucking horrible. Fish this place!!"}
{"text":"If you're going down to a game DO NOT go here.  They are not equipped to handle the mass of people that come here.  The food was fine but the service was HORRIBLE !!!!  We waited 45 minutes for our food and once it came my son ordered wings and needed more napkins and the server never brought them.  There are plenty of other choices right around there with similar food that have better service."}
{"text":"This Winking Lizard is one of my favorites to go to!  It is located inside a huge historical building in Lakewood that used to me an old Elks Lodge as well as a Tennis Club.  I enjoy how tall the ceilings are and how it is covered in old pictures from the building as well as local sports teams and beer decor. You may choose to sit in either of the 2 different dining rooms or the big bar.  Twiggy the Lizard is also a huge hit for all kids!  Patio season is coming and this will be a great spot for all to enjoy with 2 patios including a smoke free undercover area as well as tv's to catch the Indians or Browns.    The WL is known for its massive beer list and World Tour of Beers which if you finish you earn a sweet jacket!   Choose from over 35 beers on draft and over 100 bottled beers.  WL also offers monthly seasonal beers, monthly glass's of the month, and many limited availability kegs throughout each month as well as drinks of the month and shots of the month.  You can also always order beer to go home if you would like to take some of your favorite beer home that you can't find anywhere else!    The Menu is great and has something for everyone.  WL is known for their award winning BBQ sauce and I personally love the BBQ!  Monday and Tuesday nights are wing and pizza night, Weds is Rib night and Thursday is Burger night!  Also, the WL always has great lunch specials as well as amazing seasonal menus that change every 3 months or so!  If you are wanting something healthier have a nice salad or a veggie wrap with some steamed broccoli!    This is a great location to watch any sports game!  They have a numerous amount of tv's and the service is very helpful in case you would like to see a different game on any of the tv's.  The ski ball, pop a shot, and dino grab are also a big hit to keep the little kids occupied so dont forget to bring some quarters!  Also, they just got a new Photo Booth in the front lobby that could be a fun idea for many!    One drawback is the parking, but I think everywhere in Lakewood ends up having parking problems. Now that the Lizardville is in the basement the parking has been a little worse also.  I mean it has a large parking lot attached to Giant Eagle, but sometimes you may have to walk a little further than normal.  It also can be a tad cold on some of those real cold cleveland winter days!   All and all I love the WL and I think you all will have a great time here and will receive great service, great food and great drinks :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, and plenty of TVs for watching football. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Ok beer selection and decent atmosphere.  The poor review is for the wings.  I've had many wings, but these were absolutely the worst I have ever had.  No flavor, over cooked and not crispy (kind of mushy).  Also, they were called jumbo yet they were quite small.  Go for the beer, forget the wings."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. I have never had a bad experience with food or service. The new location seems significantly smaller than the old location so you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is a so so, average place all in all.   You walk in, and we had to wait until the hostesses were done talking amongst themselves before we were even acknowledged. Once seated in the bar area, you realize how close the tables are to each other.  6 inches max between 4 tops.  There's nothing in this atmosphere  that is exciting in the least. The food is mostly fried and nothing spectacular to brag of. The advantage are the TVs and the big lizard.   Blah experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and the big list of beers.  Nice staff.  Good food and very reasonably priced.  No complaints.  Ate there twice in a span of two days while in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Closing Times are wrong on Yelp. The game was on so loud the waiter couldn't hear us order and we couldn't hear each other talk across the table. When I asked to turn it down a little I was told it's a sports bar and they wouldn't turn it down at all. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. At least the burger was good."}
{"text":"This is a great local place to watch sports and eat some finger foods.  Tons of beer on tap and wait staff is friendly.  This is a loud place which is cool as long as you dont want some quiet time with your honey.  Most of the food I have eaten here is good.  If you like good wings, this really isnt the place.  Stick to Buffalo Wild Wings if you are looking for good wings.  Stick to a burger here or perhaps a salad and an appetizer."}
{"text":"This is a cool location in terms of the building. However, there isn't a lot of parking. And every time I'm here in the winter it feels cold inside. I always have to leave my coat on. Service here has been good, a little better than the other locations. Just has a lot of drawbacks compared to other Lizards."}
{"text":"I absolutely love winking lizard but this is the last time I will let the staff at this location make me feel uncomfortable.  Not only did the hostess bombard us, almost beg us, to sit at a table and not the bar so the servers could make money....but with less than 5 minutes of the game left all of the wait staff screamed at us to get out. Saying \"you have two minutes and then we're taking your drinks.\"   Very disappointed and upset almost embarrassed about this evening. Will be a very long time before we return....lost a few loyal customers tonight."}
{"text":"They always mess up my to go order-like tonight, instead of ten pack traditional wings I got eight, and if you order a burger you will easily end up with cheesesteak sandwich. Make sure you check your order right in front of them! Food quality is  average - wish those 8 wings I got tonight actually tasted like chicken. Not going back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is great. Quick service for a business lunch and usually great service after work. Only occasionally do they seem overwhelmed with a very large crowd, then don't even bother. Great food and all locally sourced."}
{"text":"Service was great! The brisket needs to become more than a seasonal selection. It was juicy, tender, and had a smoky flavor. So far the best item I've eaten at Winking Lizard. This location is definitely one of the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food quality, great customer service reminds me of a cheaper better Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Cleveland/Ohio. Many beers on tap and hundreds available by the bottle. Additionally the draft beers are frequently alternated.   Good appetizers and bar food (with wing night on Mon/Tue) but the beer selection definitely stands out more that the food."}
{"text":"In one word, Meh.  On 8/16/14, my family and I traveled from states away, for a visit in a new place, Cleveland.  We had planned on grabbing a bite to eat, then heading to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. On a trip to any new place, we always hope to find a neat, local, interesting place to eat. Winks was a short walk from the Hall, and had a neat outdoor patio. We found close parking, and headed into the restaurant. Our group of 5 stood at the host stand for a good 5 minutes before seeing the 'seat yourself' sign, hidden by the entrance. Both bartenders, and 2 servers walked by and made eye contact with us, and not a one of them said anything. Typically someone would have thrown us a  quick 'oh you guys can seat yourself' . Not here.  We found our way to the patio, and took a seat. I must also mention, that there were maybe 2 tables occupied inside the restaurant, 2 people seated at the bar, and 8 or so filled tables outside. Not very busy, considering the amount of servers on. After a few minutes, a smiling server said he would bring us menus. 5 minutes later a different, unsmiling server came to take our drink order. We asked for a drink menu, which he brought us a few minutes later. After deciding on drinks and food, and placing our orders, we waited a good 30 minutes for our food. Not too bad if the place was busy, but alas, it was not. When our food eventually came, it was brought by kitchen staff, and given to the wrong table, then to us, then to them, then back to us. The fries were greasy and cold. My black bean burger was soggy and bland. We didn't have napkins or utensils for the first 7 minutes of eating. I will say that they somewhat redeemed themselves with the bbq pork sandwich with coleslaw that my brother had ordered. My fianc√© got the bison burger, and that wasn't half bad either.  Now, I am not complaining for the sake of complaining. I just feel that we, the diners, deserve better. A smile, a hustle, better customer service. I am way ok with slow service and quick interactions at the table, if the place is swamped and the server is running around sweaty trying to take care of everyone. This was far from the case here. We could have chosen to eat at a chain restaurant, and get the same service and the same quality of food that we get at home. But we enjoy checking out what the locals have to offer, and choosing accordingly. I feel this time, we chose the wrong place.  Cool location, decent cocktails, iffy food, unfriendly staff, bad service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This dish had a strain of hair on it I was not impressed. They did politely comp the dish. And ask us if we wanted anything else."}
{"text":"Great local place.  Best draft list in town. Solid pub food. Great wings. No complaints."}
{"text":"This place can't even get simple bar food correct. I went for lunch and did not have an enjoyable experience. As this restaurant is downtown they should be used to a business lunch crowd. Therefore it's absolutely absurd that ordering a simple chicken sandwich was a two hour experience! The service was off. They had one server for the entire patio. And the food was not flavorful. Fail on both fronts for this place. Stick with winking lizard."}
{"text":"good bar food, unfortunately the ambiance is always destroyed by the hundreds of kids running around.  it feels more like a chucky cheese than a bar."}
{"text":"All I can say is...Damn kids! This is a bar/tavern not a family restaurant to bring your family!  That being said, if you ask to sit on the bar side, it's a little better. I know they probably cater to a large family market but nothing is worse than enjoying a nice lager and hearing screaming kids in the background.    I have found the one in Copley/Fairlawn seems to have more kids than the one in Peninsula (by far our favorite due to the atmosphere/location). The one in Peninsula has more of an old tavern feel with low lighting, wood floors, ect.  At least if you go on \"Family Night\" you can retreat to Lizardville (Copley/Fairlawn)"}
{"text":"I wish i could rate the food separate from the beverages. As far as beer goes, there probably isn't a better place in Cleveland to go. The bottle and tap list are amazingly awesome, and more often than not amazingly delicious. The glass of the month special is pretty nifty, and I must be a 6 year old, because i like being able to go say \"hi\" to the resident lizard, Lucy.  The food, in my opinion, is mediocre. Their bar food is too greasy, their vegetarian burger is obviously a frozen morning star patty, and the fries are too thick and often soggy. I find their white pizza to be solid though. Since I'm a vegetarian, though, i cannot weigh in on most of the menu.   I'm never upset when I end up here, but at the same time if I'm looking for a tantalizing meal, this isn't the first place on my list."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. They have plenty of different types of beer, good food, and plenty of tvs so you can watch whatever game you want."}
{"text":"This is an awful place. Cannot believe there's actually a wait for a place that uses frozen food (they microwave the crap out of). Terrible service as well, it takes about a half hour between beers. Their only saving grace is location, once people actually experience the horrible food, if they have any taste at all - they'll flee!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports with friends. Food is better than average bar food, especially burgers, buffalo chicken wrap and salad, and BBQ chicken entree."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick and good lunch. The day bartender is great. Food is a touch inconsistent compared to the Lakewood location."}
{"text":"Yes, the beers and wings are good, but why not splurge and pump some heat into the bathroom."}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the Miles road location, as it is typically less crowded due to being tucked away and somewhat off the beaten path.  Pros: divided nicely into several rooms for a warmer feel; Wings are decently priced with a great variety. Good beer selection.  Cons: Service is a bit spotty; Have screwed up a carry out order for me a couple of times."}
{"text":"Food was decent to good, beer selection was impressive, mixed cocktail was meh. I had two gin and tonics and heavy on tonic...hard to tell if there was even gin in there! Nice people."}
{"text":"Order was not correctly made. Several items.  Wings were not very good asked for extra cooked came out lukewarm and just barely cooked. pulled pork po boy was supposed to come with slaw and onion straws it did not.  Got the shrimp in garlic wine sauce $8.99 was way to much for this portion size.  Had to move our seats due to water dripping on us from vents above. Kinda hard to eat food when your swatting fruit flies and regular flies.   Overall I seriously doubt I would return.  This place reminds me of a bar with food more than a restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved the old location. This new location just flat out sucks. Very odd layout. The TV's behind the bar are simply silly. Somebody must have said 'Wouldn't it be cool to have a wall full of TV's?' Well it just looks confusing and over the top. I only had wings and they were terrible. Some of the thicker pieces seemed uncooked. I still think the Winking Lizard is a decent place but I will choose a different location and definitely stay away from the wings."}
{"text":"Iguanas with wings and popcorn; what more could you want?!?  OK, point of accuracy: the iguanas don't serve the popcorn, and they don't actually start flying until you make a little too much progress on the \"World Tour of Beers\" challenge in one sitting...ahem...so I hear...  Anyways...the chicken wings are great, coming tossed in any of about a million (15 or so) different sauces and glazes; you're sure to find one to meet your palette. I love their garlic -- so it's either the regular garlic or the spicy garlic for me!  There's plenty of great food aside from wings; I have yet to experience a bad meal. Most importantly, of course, is an incredible beer selection!! In addition to the 200+ beers as part of the aforementioned World Tour, the draught selection is impressive, too. Though, if I'm in Cleveland, why stray too far from our beloved Great Lakes Brewing? (that's a rhetorical question)  Lastly, the atmosphere is always informal and alive. Plenty of TVs and/or music keep the place going -- and it's usually a gathering of some of the best sports fans around.  What gives the 'Lizard' its fifth star is that, although technically a chain, it's a local establishment with its heart rooted in Cleveland that's simply outgrown four walls and one roof.  So, if you're not a regular yet, don't worry; there's still time."}
{"text":"Had skinny dippers at Winking Lizard in Akron about a year ago - they were awesome - here they almost tasted pink even tho they weren't.  Spicy BBQ sauce was good, but that was it.  Miller lite on tap here which I didn't think the Lizard did.  Indoor and outdoor bar very small - Won't come back here."}
{"text":"We have had a great time watching the Indian's post games here.  Our group ranges from 4-12 depending on the day and time of the game.  They have been very accommodating, especially one of the managers, Joe.  The food is good and so are the drinks.  Plenty of tv's."}
{"text":"I just love this place, I would go here everytime my Husband and I go out if he'd let me :)  This place is always busy but I know why- it's just a perfect low-key place to go out. Even though the parking lot is always full- we've never waited more than 20 minutes to be seated. Once seated, there is an amazing selection of beer for when we go out with friends and so many different non-beer options so I don't feel like the third wheel ordering something else. The food is always fresh and the service is always good. Not just the refill your drinks good, they seem happy to be working there, like they enjoy their job. I love that! Check comes quickly and servers notice the little things. I was full and didn't finish my Chicken Parm Sandwich. The server saw how much was left on my plate and made a point to make sure nothing was wrong with my meal before offering a box to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sports bars in Cleveland. It's a great place to unwind and relax after a long day at work. Totally agree with Chris L. Great place for Cheap Grub. The beer selection is great and I love the 32oz beer specials. And who can resist free popcorn?"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time the other day because I always seemed to go there at the times they won't allow the crowd younger than 21 in. After I became of age, I went in the middle of the day (sadly before their deal for cheap wings) and the bartender was also waiting all the tables in that room as well. She remained extremely friendly the entire time and our food came quickly and well done. Now that I think of it, when I was underage they even turned me down in the nicest way possible, even after I pleaded with them that I only wanted wings!  I'm huge on customer service, so this place gets 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the third Winking Lizard Tavern that we have been to.  We love ribs and chicken and order the ribs bucket and the basket of wings and share.  The beer is also reasonable.  If you're looking for a relaxed casual atmosphere with good food, come here.  Very good."}
{"text":"Very nice beer menu, the have Sierra Nevada Bigfoot on the menu...that is rare. Great place to meet before and after a game....decent bar food but nothing that stood out to me. GO & DRINK BEER!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday. We ordered our food to-go beforehand. We were told it would take 15-20 minutes. No problem. We left about 15 minutes after the order was placed. Once we got there, we waited another 45 minutes! So much for our lunch hour! it wasn't like the restaurant was busy (we looked in the restaurant & bar area as we went to & from work). It is a good thing we just work across the street. Would we do carry-on from them again? I doubt it. I think this happened to me once before, a few years ago.... Food review - my friend's salad was lacking some of the ingredients listed in the description. And, my steak wrap was very dry. And, they screwed up my order."}
{"text":"What an awful dinner!  Server was the worst we have had in a while!  Extremely slow (took 15 minutes to get my wife's soda, which we probably wouldn't have gotten if I didn't search her out to ask again for it) and could care less.  Food came out in a timely fashion and was less then stellar!!!  Over fried chicken fingers to he point that they were dry and tough and apparently when the wings are on special you only get 50% of them covered with sauce!  I remember not too long ago when this place was average; unfortunately it is no longer that!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy Saturday night. Staff was great. Very honest on wait time. Gave us options on carry out to expedite. Bar staff was awesome. Let us know last call for kitchen. An overall great experience."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out. Music and TV's aren't  to distracting if you're wanting to talk. This particular night was wing night so that's what I had but I've eaten multiple times before at the Winking Lizard and was satisfied by the service and the food. The food is nothing special though, don't go expecting something special, just your run of the mill bar food."}
{"text":"We came in the other night as a group of close to 50. We called the store first and the manager Michael, was very accommodating and willing to help us. We had three servers Amanda, Aron, and Megan who were outstanding. If given the opportunity we would come back again.   thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I'll still probably keep going but the servers are SLOW moving and my wigs are always way over done. Nothing exciting. The servers are super slow but usually pretty nice."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 16 and had a blast service and food was on point. Special thanks to Mary for taking great care of us with fast drinks and food in 15 mins."}
{"text":"Excellent bar in an area of downtown where there are not as many sports bars.  Great place to go before and after Browns games.  Excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just went to downtown Cleveland and the food choices are super limited but this place was great. Over several days we had the pulled pork, a wedge salad, a wrap and the grilled cheese (OMG, that one was good). The fries are well seasoned. Huge selection of beer. Good service. If I was ever int he area again, I'd return."}
{"text":"Used to like Winking Lizard, but the Lakewood location has really gone downhill in the past few years. The food portion and quality have been poor and the service has been abysmal. It is very close to our house and was convenient but anymore, we have ruled it out as an option.  Last visit they seated our family of 4 (2 teens) in an area surrounding with screaming toddlers. Within 15 minutes, all families had left and server spent next 45 minutes cleaning tables and washing floors on all sides of us. Took 20 minutes for drinks to come out and wings were dry and hard, as if they'd been reheated multiple times.  No thank you. Much better options abound."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon and a stout beer (forget the name). The salmon was decent, but the beer was fabulous! It was like a cross between guineas and a chai tea latte. After a long day of meetings, it really hit the spot. Great atmosphere, it was totally chill."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers.  Food service a little slow and the buffalo chicken wrap wasn't that good. Overall not bad, decent place prior to a baseball game."}
{"text":"Great beer list. Average bar food. My haddock sandwich was a frozen slab of fish that resembled a larger version of a fast food fish sandwich. Hubby's bbq brisket looked good & he really enjoyed it. Very convenient to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"Wing night Monday and Tuesday night. Good naked wings. Hot is just right.."}
{"text":"Our food wasn't cooked properly,  and I guess water vapor counts as cigarette smoke? Not somewhere I'll be going back to."}
{"text":"Don't know how to cook a burger, that's for damn sure, order one med well, comes out like charcoal, get a replacement no problem at all, and it's F***ING RARE, not to mention waited 20 mins on the first one and another 15 for the replacement, it was absolutely deliberate, I will absolutely be looking for better options to spend my hard earned cash on, I have no problems paying more for top dollar food such as Yardhouse for instance, but maybe I'll have to start putting my money where my mouth is after my most recent visit here"}
{"text":"Definitely liked the burgers! Especially the Big Ed which is a one pound burger and great for getting lots of protein. Couldn't even really eat my fries after. My only two problems are that the corn dog bites I ordered for my daughter aren't that tasty so I got why she didn't like them, because I didn't. Also the fact that they don't have boneless wings as an app. You can order them that way, but if you want 10 which is a good size to share then it'll cost you 10.50 which seems like a lot of money to spend on wings that weren't all out amazing."}
{"text":"The restaurant on Coventry is great - good food, good service. But we went downtown expecting the same thing and we were very disappointed by the service. The food took very long, the servers barely came past our table even though it wasn't busy, and when the food eventually arrived we did not have cutlery or condiments (that took a while to come too). Don't bother going to the downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard gets a bad rap on this site.  A lot of the complaints are valid but there are a lot of good things about this bar, especially when you compare it to the other bars on Coventry.  First of all, it's really more of a restaurant than a bar--the seating area is much bigger than the two bars combined.  I think the bar-style food is good: burgers, wings, ribs, fried food.  But pretty much everything on the menu is good, even the salads and pizzas are decent, so you can keep a lot of people happy here. They have monthly food specials so there's always something new to try--I had a very good Bison burger here.  MUCH better food than McNinni's down the street.  The beer list is big, and is overrated.  But the selection is a an order of magnitude bigger than the other bars on the street (Wine Cave excluded) so you WILL find something you like.  Since the bar area is small it's not a great place to watch the big game.  But this place has like 10 TVs lined up at the bar, so if you're an out-of-town football or baseball fan you are pretty much guaranteed that they will put your team's game on."}
{"text":"Always great service....I go there a lot for happy hour and recently went there for the Championship Parade. They handled things very well and didn't allow too many people in. Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all Winking Lizards in general.  I am not a huge fan of bar food, but the Lizard menu has a decent variety of non-burger/wing options.  I especially like that they have a seasonal menu so there are regularly new things to try.  I also love the daily specials and beer selection.  The beer paddle is fantastic for people like me who just want to try a little bit of everything.  I think their food is priced fairly and the quantities are satisfying.  I also really like that their fries are thicker than average.  This is probably my least favorite Winking Lizard location.  I haven't been to every single one, but I have been to at least a half dozen others.  The parking can be a pain (although not nearly as bad as the new Independence location), and it's overall just kind of a boring venue (compared to the others).  That being said, it's better than the other nearby options (Chili's, Applebees, etc).  The bathrooms were dirty and only partially functional when I visited last night, but I wouldn't say that is common.  Our server was nice and the service was fast."}
{"text":"You have to love the Lizard!!! The staff is great, the food is good and the beer selection is immense. If you enjoy any or all of these things then you have to come to the Lizard. If you love beer, join the World Tour and enjoy many different beers and earn yourself a World Tour jacket."}
{"text":"Just noting that their spinach artichoke dip is verrrrry tasty. And we also went for wing night (which if I'm remembering correctly occurs on both Monday and Tuesday) and the sauces were really good. I recommend the \"Spicy Sesame,\" although it's really not spicy (the Mild has more of a kick). The Thai sauce also got high marks.  I recently went to a BW3 and had their boneless wings. In comparison  with the Lizard's boneless, BW's are better. But I'd still give the Lizard's wings a shot."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! There was a large group of us and our server did great! I wish I could remember his name. He did very well with his suggestions and the food was great! We were in somewhat of a hurry and the restaurant suited our needs! We will be back when in the area!!"}
{"text":"The second yelper meet-up brought me to Winking Lizard for the first time.  It was redonkulously crowded when I arrived, but I expected that because it was Friday night.  I crowd-surfed a bit and found my fellow yelpers at a booth.  The waitress didn't seem to mind that we kept adding people to our table.  She was very attentive and kept returning to ask if we needed anything.  However, a couple of negative spots: they seemed to be out of quite a few of Will's beer choices, in addition to the kitschy \"Beer of the Month\" glass that I had been hoping to acquire for the Great Lakes Christmas Ale they featured this month.  (I had the beer anyway - my first time - and it was great).  I almost considered taking the boring glass it came in as a souvenir....half kidding.  While I mentioned that our waitress kept coming back to us, she wasn't really friendly; in fact, I found her kind of the opposite of friendly.  She didn't really venture into bitchy territory, but her attitude was still less than stellar.  Maybe it was just a hard night.  She also only give me 4 dollars back when I gave her a $20 for my $5.80 beer.  She instantly corrected this when I mentioned it to her, though.  Maybe Murray will tell you about the cougar who came up to him inquiring about his shirt for her son's band.  Didn't try the food, but I would not mind coming back to sample some! (And Amy, I appreciate the mention in your review of what NOT to do with ranch dressing.  Some people have no idea.) ;)"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection but the service is offensively horrible. 7 people leasirely sitting around the bar and it takes a bar back to acknowledge me after 30+ mins.  No other attention paid till I called out for bill... too busy cleaning glasses it seems?"}
{"text":"This is your typical run of the mill neighborhood bar (even though it's a local chain). It's a great place for groups, families and a great place to watch any sports event. They have a ton of tvs in both the bar area and the dining room.  The food is sub-par but they have a decent size menu to choose from so you can take a vegetarian and meat lover here. The beer list is pretty fantastic here! If you like to try new beers this would be a good place to start."}
{"text":"My rating hasn't changed, but I AM a little more excited to go here now that they have Lizard Freckles! FRIED PICKLES! They aren't the best fried pickles I've ever had, but I have trouble turning down a pickle. So, now they have two attractions for me: glass of the month and fried pickles! How could they go wrong? (Though I didn't get this month's glass because it sounds like I won't like the beer...)"}
{"text":"The most exciting part about the Winking Lizard is that it's the first restaurant I've seen anywhere near my hotel that's not a chain.  Oops, turns out it is a chain. Just an Ohio one I've never heard of. Too bad.  Food was decent, I was actually a very big fan of my Cajun Cobb Salad which was huge and had great ingredients (mmm, big chunks of avocado, perfectly cooked bacon, and gorgonzola.) Wings and other meals at the table were just alright. Ok outdoor patio, and I wish I wasn't working so I could have enjoyed the beer selection they tout. Overall not particularly special, but given the limited options in this area I may be back in the next few weeks. ------  Return trip today... had a pretty tasty turkey sandwich. I got a better look at the beer menu and it is pretty extensive and fairly cheaply priced (though I'm used to the big city cost of drinking so that may not be an accurate assessment). They've got a good list of nightly specials, too. Inside dining is not nearly as pleasant an atmosphere as the patio though, so save your visit for good weather."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the epitome of A-OK. I've been here twice, one time being for post-5K drinks and the other for opening day drinks and dinner with a small group. During both visits, the service was great and the beer and food was exactly as expected. Nothing more, nothing less.  I will say that from what I've seen, this bar is more my speed than any of the other sports bars downtown. Less people and a little easier to handle."}
{"text":"We arrived in Cleveland at about 10p and needed to ear. The woman at the front desk suggested the Winking Lizard because it was s short walk Dom the hotel. We ordered margaritas. They were a total disappointment,  very weak and garnished with limes that were old with brown patches. Really????"}
{"text":"I'm going to settle in the middle and call this a 3. I've had a few dining experiences that were 4's, including their: Orval Bison burger (10/10) Garlic ribbon fries (8/10) Original ribbon fries (7.5/10) Bavarian soft pretzel (8/10) I've also had some not so great experiences including their: Thai peanut wings (4/10) -They were overcooked and just not a good flavor. (and I LOVE Thai peanut) Beer cheese dip (5/10) -Very bland, not much flavor at all   In one experience, my waitress was unable to get my World Tour Card to register the beers we tried. She said that if I took my receipt to my usual location, they would be able to take care of it. At my next visit (at my usual location) they explained that only Winks can enter their receipts into the system (because Winks had it on tap and my location only had it as a bottle) and they could do nothing for me. It was only a few beers, but the whole thing left me a little peeved.   I experienced slow service on all three occasions, but I attribute it to the times that I go there (either 5:30pm or noon). Both of these are peak times, so I don't hold it against them too much.   I love the Winking Lizard chain as a whole, this particular location not so much. It was more out of convenience as I was working across the street at the Federal building."}
{"text":"We walked in and waitress passed us three times before she noticed us.  Reminds me of TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesday's. Etc. average food and average service.   I did like the sports bar vibe with multiple TVs to watch the basketball games.   I did not have any beer but the did have an excellent selection.   Not a bad experience, just nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. It was packed before the browns game but we just hung out next door until it started. Service was great. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip and it is amazing. It comes with buffalo waffle fries. Good beer selection and decent prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited with my boyfriend and our 2 kids. The kids liked their meals off the kids menu, however, I wasn't too fond of the Cajun Chicken Sandwhich. It was just grilled chicken w/ mozzarella, doesn't come w/ any kind of sauce on it so it was dry and I couldn't really taste the cajun seasoning. It was just too bland for me. My boyfriend had the BBQ chicken sandwhich and he liked the BBQ sauce. I also got a side of mac and cheese and that was nice and cheesy! Overall not too bad but I'm not sure we'd visit again. The previous reviews say it's kid friendly but the seating isn't really set up that way, most of the tables are high tops with a few that are low. Like any normal tavern, but my kids got bored quickly."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go, World Tour of Beers is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and winking lizards was recommended, it did not disappoint. The wait staff is wonderful so nice and engaging. Wait times for food and drinks were quick, we were checked back in on several times. We had such a good experience  we came back a second night in a row. It was after an Indians game so the place was absolutely packed but we still received the same great service which is truly a testament to how hard their team works. Great food- great experience."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but they short change the air conditioning in the summer in a place devoid of any shade in the outside surroundings.  Seems to me this has been an issue sice the opening.  Really good servers and bartenders, especially Tony, Heather and Jake."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place.  Received great service and great food.  It was a Wednesday night and this place was very crowded during dinner time.  While waiting for your table, you can enjoy the complimentary popcorn!    It's a great place to watch sporting games.  The place has flat screens everywhere.  The beer selection is also stellar.    The BBQ was great.  If you haven't been there, get the sampler!  it's enough food for two people, so share it and try out the different types of bbq!"}
{"text":"Got seated right away but waited over 1.5 hours for food after ordering and it was like pulling teeth to get any drink refills. Mind you it was slow on a Sunday, and our server was just walking around \"acting\" busy while he was actually watching March madness. When the food FINALLY came, he only got about half our order correct. When the bill came we were charged for to many drinks."}
{"text":"Came across this place while running an errand for work. The interior was okay nothing special wait yes there was the have this huge  iguana, and yes it's real. While there I ate the cheese stixs, and had the shrum burger it was delicious, maybe the best burger I've had in a while, their french fries I can live with, they weren't good at all.  If your hungry and in the area try their burgers."}
{"text":"Went here after visiting the R&R HOF with my husband and our two boys ages 6 and 9.  It was perfect.  Good burgers and kids menu. Plenty of tvs for the hubs to watch some sports and have a couple beers.  Kids loved Queenie the iguana.  I had a couple cosmos which were perfect after a long day with the kids.  We walked back to the hotel happy and relaxed. Staff was super friendly and prices very reasonable! Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, food and feel!! A huge shout out to Tom our amazing bar tender two nights there! Thanks for the great food and time."}
{"text":"First time at a Winking Lizard since there are none in our area.  Enjoyed the Bavarian Pretzels and both the sauces.  Enjoyed my pulled chicken melt along with the onion rings on the side.   Husband had a special of brisket with potato pancakes and was also pleased.  A fun place to eat when traveling."}
{"text":"These have got to be some of the best bar wings in the entire city.  Many locations throughout NEO and all flavors we've tried have been rock star.  We also love their Phred's Phries with bacon, cheddar and sour cream.  Yummers!  Great beer selection to boot, plus about a billion TV screens to watch your favorite game. Ahhh...bliss..."}
{"text":"Lakewood Winking Lizard is a great option for lunch, to catch a Cav's game, or meet-up with friends on the weekend. Their bar is separated from the dining room so you don't have to worry about being too loud for families while you drink with your friends. YEAH!   They have a small stage in the bar area and often have live bands.  There is bowling in the basement! Woohoo!!   This is definitely not a dive and in the top 10% of Lakewood bars, rated on cleanliness, class, and clients. Yes, you might run into some hambones and hooknasties, but it isn't the majority of patrons. You can be a bit older than the average Lakewood crowd (40-50) and feel comfortable meeting here.   I like the Buffalo Chicken Salad with grilled chicken instead of breaded.  They sell gluten free beer."}
{"text":"I like the Buffalo Chicken Salad subbed with grilled chicken and ranch dressing instead of breaded chicken and bleu cheese dressing.   It is a $1 upcharge for the grilled chicken, but well worth it. I love the celery in the salad!   I think I get this salad almost every time I come. Don't you dare dump the ranch on the salad...that makes me sick when I see that. Please use the ranch sparingly.   I don't like their fries; they are like limp, soggy versions of Wendy's fries without the flavor. Don't bother with them.   They serve Gluten Free beer in bottles (either New Grist or Redbridge).   It is a business crowd at lunch. It could probably be a nice place to meet an employed man if you tried.   They have a patio, but it isn't a draw; it is small and uninviting."}
{"text":"Above average burger, good service and large beer menu. Can't ask for more. Try the 1 pound burger it is juicy, big and tasty!"}
{"text":"If you rated this place as a bar and beer list..hands down its a 5 star place!!! The food is average at best or maybe I misordered. I got the chicken teriyaki trying to be healthier while traveling and it was ok. If I had order what I wanted the sandwiches sounded much better. Service was quick and atmosphere is a good sports bar vibe."}
{"text":"I had the western burger with friend. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. This is a pub style type restaurant.  Very casual. The beer selection is unbelievable,  literally dozens of beers from all over the world. Not a place I'll demand to go to the next time I'm in cleveland, but a good place to grab a bite to eat and a beer."}
{"text":"I have visited many different Winking Lizards and they seem to be all very similar but distinct. This location was nice because of the great location, ergo, there were a lot of crowds here though. None-the-less I got there with a friend around 7pm and we were immediately sat which was nice. With only two people it is not impossible to get seated immediately at peak times of course but there is always that chance. I digress. The menu is pleasing to anyone as it has a lot of the more 'comforting/safe' foods like burgers, chicken items, fries, wings, etc. So you are bound to find something that you like and if you are trying to lose the lbs, they have lighter options as well. My friend got those because although she is already thin, she cannot take the chance of a burger, lord forbid. I digress. The burger and fries I got had a great portion size, a bit more than you can find anywhere but overall I was impressed since chains don't seem to give up the extras. The crowds were certainly there and there were many large groups hanging about making noise. The staff was on point and had recommendations of course if you were to inquire about them. Not a bad place to go after work or whenever you feel."}
{"text":"The Lakewood Winking Lizard is by far the best in town! Spacious and charming, and full of great food, just how I like my restaurants!  I recently fell in love with their boneless wings. More meat, less mess! And the range of sauces they have is impressive! On Mondays (and Tuesdays, I think?) they have 35 cent wings, a wonderful deal.  I have never been disappointed with my food here. Their burgers are good, their pulled pork sandwich excellent (pulled pork is always excellent), and they have a hell of a 24 oz root beer.  The only downside? Don't order a non-beer drink here. Every Wink I've been to is stingy on the liquor, opting instead for more sour mix. I do not like this substitution. I want a drink made well, which doesn't usually entail simply making it stronger, just making it with accurate proportions of ingredients.  However, for the beer and the bar food, this is your best bet. What's more the Lakewood location has a BOWLING ALLEY IN THE RESTAURANT. Can't argue with that!"}
{"text":"I love and support the Winking Lizard more than any other local bar chain in the Land. Everything on the menu is delicious, especially the wings, and the giant beer list is a unrivaled. There is no better place for bar food and brews. Plus free popcorn while you wait or walk to the Q!  I have been coming to lizards for years and before a cavs game it is usually my go-to place before a game or any event at the Q because of its close proximity, large menu and beautiful beer list. Their spicy BBQ sauce on boneless or traditional wings is one of my top wing sauces period. From their fried pickles, to mac n cheese wedges, or the southwest egg rolls, you can't go wrong with their any apps. My mouth is watering just typing this. Burgers, Pizza, grilled cheese, salads, I have had them all and they are reasonably priced and we'll worth their price in terms of tastiness.  They have seasonal specials that change on a monthly basis that most regulars love as well.  But the reason I personally keep coming back to lizards is their thirst quenching beer list. They have the cheesecake factory menu of beers, by that I mean it is HUGE. A beer lovers paradise. The offer a dozen of so monthly rotating taps, about 25 quarterly rotating bottles and then a bottle list of what feels like 100 plus beers. They also have their famous beer tour, which is a contest you sign up for to try and drink 100 different beers in the calendar year period, which I am proud to say I have accomplished.  If you are looking for a food or beer fix and haven't been to lizard, what are you waiting for? Go to the gateway location before tour next concert or game. If you are a regular, I'm not really sure why you are reading this but try a different beer or something new on the menu. I dare you to tell me it wasn't good."}
{"text":"Good wings and decent food. I usually stick with their specials as they tend to be better than the standard menu fare they have.  Service is always good and they make a good burger.  I go here pretty regularly."}
{"text":"I went into Winks last week on a Tuesday night with a few friends of mine and thought we would try out the newest spin on the Winking Lizard concept. Local brews and spirits paired with local organic food, what could go wrong. Well the food sucked, just plain sucked. Bland tasting flat-breads, boring fries, and the homemade chips are the worst. I ordered this mushroom and carmalized onion flatbread and all I tasted was dough, seriously. I asked the barmaid if the potatoes were cut by hand and she said no. I guess they were locally frozen and packaged. The beer selection was cool, but overpriced. Restaurant lacks atmosphere and can't seem to decide if its a sports bar or a restaurant with a bar (think Applebee's). Service was nothing to brag about either, the bartender, Van I think, spent more time trying to sell me on these egg-white martini's than pouring the beer I requested. Overall, I'm sure this place is busy for lunch but people deserve better."}
{"text":"The best thing I could say about Winking Lizard (the chain in general) is that its exceptionally average.  Nothing really all that special, or all that bad. I mean save for the wing sauce selection, and not the teeny wings themselves, and the mascot, they're just another family bar.   Ok MAYBE a better beer selection.  The Lizard won't do you wrong, but like others have said, there are better places to go for the same price, and with better food. Pretty much an option to break up monotony and not much else."}
{"text":"Good after work or before game bar. Great selection of craft beer and pretty good food. Service is a little slow but not bad. Great location right on East 9th, walking distance to Stadium or Gateway ."}
{"text":"Decent (not great) food but the service stinks. The attitude from the hostess on down is sub par and act like theyre doing you a favor. With all the great spots within a 5 minute walk the service here should be better. Give E4th a shot or walk near the casino and let these self important people sit around on their butts like they obviously prefer to do."}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend and enjoyed it. Our server was great and very friendly. The pretzels are HUGE! The food was good. I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to grab food before a game. It is conveniently located near the Q and Progressive Field, and the prices are competitive with places nearby. The weirdest thing about this location is the shape of the building - it is long and narrow and that can make navigating it difficult.  Other than that, it's solid. It's loud, but as a tavern, you have to expect that. The menu is huge - in many ways it's too much. However, everything I've ever had has been good. Even the salmon, while not as good as I've had, was very good here - far above what I would expect from a tavern and restaurant that doesn't do much seafood. The service has also been more than adequate! No matter how busy it gets I never feel forgotten!"}
{"text":"Wink's is clearly in transition mode.  Right now it is part Lizardville, part Wink's and part Winking Lizard.  Whatever the nameplate, the Cajun chicken salad needs to be removed from the menu.  Seasoning is sprinkled straight out of a mix and is way too strong.  Ruined the salad.  Service was decent but one of our meals arrived at the table 7 minutes before the other two.  Awkward.  The beer cheese dip with crostini is ALWAYS a winner...damn, that stuff is good.  Our server swore they did not validate parking but when I got down to the garage the garage attendant said as long as I spent more than $20 at Wink's I only owed him $2.  So I busted out my $40 lunch receipt and pow, only paid $2.  But how did he server not know that?  The only keeper in the meal? By the grace of God Wente Riva Ranch Chardonnay is on the wine list BTG.  Remarkable.  That is a great glass of wine and has been for years so the beverage manager got something right on the wine list."}
{"text":"Out of all their locations this is the best! Porsha and Lanny are the best servers and Dom the manager is awesome too! Highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Where to start...consistency is not to be expected from this location. Before I delve any deeper into my experience at the Coventry Winking Lizard, I recommend you drive the extra distance to any other near by location and for go this one entirely. Watch out on Monday or Tuesday wing and pizza night, the food will be great but the service will leave a lot to be desired. Ask for a box for the remaining pizza I had left, which at any other location my server will more than happily provide. On Coventry, you will not receive such customer service because consistency is something that is not practiced here. Typically if you pay for the food you get to take home what is left. With my experience I attempted to negotiate with the server, I would be happy to order desert and if they happen to walk past a box I would appreciate it. Most servers would happily oblige, this time they didn't. Subsequently I didn't order the desert in a lack of faith of the servers competence; note to the owner of this troubled establishment: a please consider retraining your staff regarding profit and lose. Your store lost on a sale because your staff decided to disregard a controllable effort and lost a long time patron. I will be taking my business, and people I know, to other consistent establishments going forward. If I heard correctly, this location was moving to Mayfield Heights potentially? When you do, please consider seeking a more friendly and more competent staff."}

If this place wins one more \"Best Beer Selection\" award, I'm killing that iguana."}
{"text":"Agree 100% with other reviews that said the management is horrible. Nevermind that the waitress was very slow and only came to the table twice, to get our drink order and get our food order. Some other person brought both (different person each time) But, when we went to pay my credit card company wanted a phone confirmation from me to prevent fraud, because I had been traveling lot recently.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, the manager of the restaurant was listening in on my conversation with my credit card company.  She did not say anything when the woman at the company asked if it was a secure line. She sat silently through the verification process, listening to all my personal info.  WILL NOT be going back."}
{"text":"i agree with the previous poster that Thursday nights are a winner at this place.  This bar is always hoppin' with a good crowd of people.  Bar service is very good and they usually play great music.  I think the Lizard has THE BEST hot sauce!  yum."}
{"text":"This place has a super cool pop machine. I don't really like the menu though. there's not a lot of stuff on there that seems appetizing. So many people love the place though. The barbecue sauce there is to die for though."}
{"text":"Never been here before and I won't return. We stopped in for some after dinner cocktails. These were the most watered down drinks I have ever been served. I assumed this place was a bar because of the word 'tavern' in the name. Based on the number of kids running around and how much of the cocktails were water this place was a Chuck e Cheese that serves alcohol. If what you are looking for is a bar stay away from here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Service is excellent and the menu goes on for days."}
{"text":"I must start by saying that I am not a resident of Ohio, however, I wish I was. The winking lizard is a lot of fun if you like beer and wings. It sounds stereotypical but weather it is or not is irrelevant because the Winking Lizard does it well! I would completely recommend the chicken wings. they're fresh and well fried, and there are several sauce options. We had a great waitress who brought us a small sampler of some of the different sauces, and that was a nice touch. They were also running an Octoberfest special menu while I was there, and they were all great!  Make no mistake, the winking lizard is not a four star restaurant but if you have kids and want a place to go that is cheap and tasty then go! Or if you like football or whatever and want a place to sample a colossal beer selection, then go!"}
{"text":"Ended up here when the brain dead hostess at the Peninsula location just couldn't seem to get us seated.  I like this new location.  Better vibe than the old Rockside Rd location and the service and food was great.  Our waitress was terrific.  Lakewood is our home Wink but this is a good one too!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place but I have to say I had the WORST Margarita of my life here...and I'm a huge Margarita drinker (notice I give it enough respect to capitalize the name)  but this place made a Margarita like whiskey sour and it was so sour that I couldn't drink it and had to send it back. In all fairness, they may have had a rookie bartender that night who didn't know how to make one and decided to just wing it, hoping the ignoramus at the table wouldn't know any better...not knowing the Margarita Queen was on the receiving end.  The reason I say that is that I went to the Winking Lizard on Huron, downtown the other night, and told the waitress to ask the bartender to go easy on the 'sour mix' (thinking all Winking Lizards made them that way) to which she seemed puzzled and said, 'they don't use sour mix in a Margarita' LOL I said, 'well they need to send someone over to the Lakewood location and tell them that because they seem to be confused as to what a Margarita is and have decided it's a whiskey sour with tequila' ...other than that, I enjoyed the Lakewood location. Food is so so but good enough for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good beer selection, and an awesome happy hour. They had free wi-fi so it is a mice place to get a beer and do some work. Love it!"}
{"text":"So very pleased with this stop! Service is my number one priority and I received exceptional care today. Friendly service, accommodating my requests, talking local bourbon... Sam took great care of me.   Bonus? The bison blue cheese burger was fantastic as were the house made chips.  Very crisp, not overly salted, not overcooked.   The whiskey flights, sample sizes were welcomed and I settled on a local spirit called Cleveland Whiskey 87 which was smooth and perfect for a Saturday afternoon of people watching.   In a new city for the first time I rarely return to the same spot as I want to take in different places... this may warrant an exception.   Thank you, Sam, for the exceptional service, great food, accommodating me and the beautiful spirits.   I'm pleased!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few of our friends while we're in Cleveland for the day. To start off with, the place is HUGE! It's nice because there's a section for families & then another section for people over 21. The ambiance definitely adheres to the name of the restaurant! As soon as you enter the place, there's an lizard just hanging out in a glass terrarium. We were in the bar area, and there's a huge sign of an actual \"winking lizard.\" Our waiter was absolutely hilarious! He was really nice and joked around with us during our stay. He made sure to ask us if we needed refills and checked up on us without us feeling rushed. The only reason why I didn't get them 5 stars was because their food is a little bland. I had a grilled cheese (which I know is definitely not a specialty of theirs), but their fries were bland and under-seasoned. However, I would definitely come again because their drinks were really good & also reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this place, and both times I enjoyed myself. The drinks are okay and the food good. The service is positive and helpful throughout the dining experience. Best of all drinks are inexpensive. The place do look a little dated which is why I took two stars off. Overall I would return for drinks."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and they charged extra for salsa, getting wings with different types of sauces  and a swig of beer to taste. The staff was apologetic for the up charges and good but it didn't make up for the faults."}
{"text":"Consistent Winking Lizard!  Wings are always delicious, service was great, lots of seating and plenty of TV's!!"}
{"text":"I love Winking Lizard, especially their pizza and wings.   Last night we arrived at this location and we were seated at 9:50 on the patio. No one ever came to greet us once seated, however exactly 10 minutes later the hostess returns to tell us that we cannot be served because the kitchen was closed. I asked what time the kitchen closes and she tells us 10. Ok, but we were seated before 10 and you conveniently wait 10 minutes to come tell us the kitchen was closed. She states \"the kitchen just asked if I seated someone and reminded me that the kitchen was closed.\" She then proceeds to tell me that they begin to break down the kitchen at 9:30 to which my reply was \"so the kitchen closes at 9:30 not 10.\"   I call the manager today who explains to me that we still should've been served or offered to sit at the bar where they have a limited after hours menu which we were not offered.   I will return but this definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for this location."}
{"text":"This review is about customer service.  Let's just say you get out of the joint on a Tuesday and you're jonesing for something to eat and something to drink. You've been incarcerated for awhile. You have forty dollars.  Go to the Winking Lizard in Macedonia and get wings. Do it. They have a special where you can get a wing for forty cents and even though that seems like a lot, forty cent wings pile up on you in a hurry and the beer and all them TVs mess you up and its a madhouse food frenzy Caligula bathroom blowout kind of goodness. I got chicks to buy me the beer so you can bet I got me a lot of wings. Not a hundred like you'd think because at some point I got greedy and switched to 'boneless wings' which is a silly name because no chicken could fly using these little wads of meat in any sort of quixotic exploration of the heavens. Orville and Wilbur Wright would have just ate them boneless 'wings' but you know they'd be cussing everybody out because those two gents with their mustaches and top hats flat out know what's a wing and what is a meat gob. Me too.  You can swallow a boneless wing whole and that gulp only cost you thirty five cents. You can hurt Gaia's sensibilities wolfing on really cheap wings sauced up in some hot red buttery slurry. And you drink beer in giant garbage-can sized glasses. All on tap and just fine.  Here's the customer service part. The waitresses in this place smile no matter what you say to them. At the thirty or forty wing mark I tried to piss one off. One of the wings was sort of busted up and I asked her if it was a post-mortem wound or was I eating a victim of animal cruelty. She smiled. I switched gears and went with the crude male chickens are cocks stuff but she didn't care.   She goes, \"Your friend at the bar wonders if you'd like another drink?\"   Sigh.   \"Sure, I'll go with the Ommegang Thirsty Dog Nutbrown Chocolate Stout IPA from Reinheissendorfer Brewery. A fine pour, indeed.\"   She smiles and gets me a beer. Because the customer service in this place is awesome. She was too awesome to get angry.  Wednesday morning I decided to be adult about the resultant excretory explosion that had been inevitable from the start and perfectly foul in the most incredible way. I called the Northeast Ohio Sewer District to apologzie for what I had done to their waste treatment facilities.  Bernice was not good at customer service. She didn't have a clue what I was apologizing for even when I told her to go look out back at the lagoon. Go look, I said, I'm sure its there by now. She called me sir a few times and put me on hold and she's all explain it again, please and then hung up on me. Fine. When that vinegar-based, chile pepper-chicken, stomach acid, dark beer, circus peanut (don't ask) packet of death hits their clay-based solid waste flocculation system, that thing is going to crash. As it should.  No self-respecting clay-based solid waste flocculation system should endure an insult like the one I gave it Wednesday morning.  Three stars so Jason will get off my case."}
{"text":"Completely upset by the service. Got here and ordered our drinks after our friends had already been here. When he my family's orders our server said he would bring refills for our friends. About 15-20 minutes later he came back and said he had not forgotten about us but had.  We asked for a refill of chocolate milk for my younger daughter and again, we waited an unusually long one for a refill. He never asked us how our meals were or if we needed any thing. He never checked on us at all. He got The quantity wrong form my wings( which is minor) but still another thing i experienced with my bad service. This is not a review on this place as a whole, but a review on his experience tonight. I hope that no one else has to experience service like this again."}
{"text":"The beer was excellent. I had the Baja Fish Tacos and they were a total flop. Fish sticks don't count as fish to me. I barely at it."}
{"text":"Place was a very loud, but got quieter with every beer I drank.  The waitress was very nice, and the food was good bar and Grill fare."}
{"text":"Meh. Bar food was okay and prices aren't that great. I get the locals love it but disappointed me a lot."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices and an awesome beer list. This restaurant never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Let's start with bad service, terrible food, and even worse pop corn.  How do you screw up pop corn?  There is nothing 911 about the wing sauce here.  I was expecting heat instead I got a watered down version Frank's RedHot sauce.  The wings tasted like they were sitting under the sun for hours, completely overcooked and grossly crispy.  1 additional star for a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Out of town guests visiting Cleveland, we stumbled upon this place hungry and desperate lol.  From the looks of it I wasn't expecting more than some typical pub food, and was immediately surprised by the options on the menu.  (Hubby was super impressed with the beer list. We love seeing Dogfish Head when we go out)  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with rice pilaf and a side of broccoli soup.  Everything was SO GOOD!  Service was a little slow that afternoon, and I was bummed my soup came out at the same time as my meal, but in the end it didn't make a big enough difference to dock a star over.  The portion sizes were more than generous and the quality was superb.  So much more than I was expecting from a bar filled with leg lamps from A Christmas Story!"}
{"text":"Really nothing you can say bad about the Winking Lizard! Great service, the hostess was super friendly, our waitress was extremely helpful. The employees seem to enjoy their jobs and put you first. Great atmosphere. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meal. I would give 5 stars but it does have average bar food. Nothing fantastic but nothing bad at all. Nachos have standard ballpark cheese on them. If you go, make sure you get something with BBQ sauce. They also have a 32oz Miller Lite for around $4, it was a great deal! I enjoyed the Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza are some of the best in Cleveland! The service here is impeccable and you cannot beat the beer selection and free popcorn!  Every time I am back in Cleveland, I insist on going here!"}
{"text":"Food always good, service always good, location great...this place is one of our family favorites.  Beer selection superb!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the garlic bread, Hef on tap and my salad. I was looking at their over sized menu for like 20 minutes before narrowing it down to baby-backs or the riblet dinner. I asked the waiter what he preferred and he said \"I dunno, it's all touch and go, but the baby-backs are usually good\". Hmmmmm...I went with the baby-backs. The only reason I didn't leave, was that it was like 30 degrees outside and effing snowing, my ears were cold and I had been in an airplane all day and had only consumed Bloody Mary's and delta airways biscoff cookies. Soo, baby-backs I go. after drinking my really good and much needed beer, my dinner arrived. The ribs had this SUPER HOT un-edible sauce on it that I could only assume was by accident. If you know me, I can eat hot sauce my the bucket-full and eat jalapenos like Altoids, so if I say it was \"SO hot it was un-edible\", I mean it. The waiter didn't apologize, just brought me another beer and walked away. After scraping the charred pepper-shit off my ribs, I lathered them in the house BBQ sauce located table-side, ate all my bread and my salad which was appetizing and got the aftertaste out, but the ribs were gross and the Cole slaw was \"alright\", Enough said. I probably wont go there again, unless I just want a cold beer."}
{"text":"This place is your typical sports/local bar. The menu is very predictable with spinach artichoke dip being one of my favorite. Their ribs aren't bad either. Winking Lizard delivers what you are looking for, but nothing unique or really amazing either."}
{"text":"I really like this place , from the wing sauces to the pizzas managers and service is great also. Does get overly crowed sometimes but what do you expect, solid food and good staff"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Crappy food at a fair price. I used to go here regularly, for the beer tour and cheap wings. Never ordered anything else because I would get sick every time I ate there. I have a few friends that work/have worked in the kitchen. They don't change their gloves, they don't cool things properly, and the cutting boards were cleaned properly once in the year my friend was a supervisor there. Do not recommend this place unless your looking food shit food for cheap. I have them one star because there beer selection is pretty good."}
{"text":"We're WL fans through and through. It is one of the only restaurant our whole family can agree on, and the Lakewood location is our favorite next to the Coventry location (and that one is just for nostalgia reasons). The service is usually great, and the Lakewood location is huge, so there's rarely much of a wait for a table. The menu is fantastic; there's something for everyone with the exception of pasta. Pizza, sandwiches, steaks, grilled chicken, wraps, soups, great apps, salads, wings, fish, etc.   My favorite go-to dish is either the mild wings (bone-in) with a wedge salad or the strip steak. Hubby usually gets the patty melt or pizza, and my daughter loves the boneless wings. The patio is nice in the summer (especially now that the covered area is reserved for non-smokers, because nothing ruins a nice patio lunch like someone puffing on nasty cancer sticks at the next table). There are also games for the kids to play--skee ball, arcade games and a few games of skill. It's overall a fun joint!"}
{"text":"Squee! We love Winking Lizard. No, seriously. We frequent the Lakewood location most, followed closely by Independence. We also go to Coventry and Brunswick occasionally as well.  While Lakewood usually doesn't have a wait, Independence is fun and their patio is awesome.   We don't drink much, but when we do order a drink, it's good here. The World Tour of Beers is awesome! If you're a beer lover, you'll probably be thrilled with it. Personally, i think beer tastes like poo, which is why I love the best part of the restaurant: the food!  So. Much. Yumminess. The wings are hands down the best in the city, in my opinion. I eat a low carb diet, so wings are a staple for me at the Lizard. I usually stick with the buffalo wings and they are always delish. Crispy, not breaded-- and they'll give you all flats or drums (flats for me!) if you ask nicely. :) They also have awesome homemade ranch dressing. However, they only give you that kind if you order a salad (speaking of which, their salads rock! The spinach salad, the caesar, the House, the wedge-- all yummmmy!). The wings come with pre-packaged ranch, but if you ask, they'll give you the good stuff too.   When I can afford a little more carbs, my go-to app are the lizard freckles (fried pickle chips). They are insanely good! Crispy, thin cut-- ranch for dipping (but they usually come with a horseradish sauce). Drool. I'm craving it as I write this.   Their pizza, burgers and kids menu is also great. And yes-- you can't forget the free popcorn! It's better than the stuff they give you at the movies, I swear. :)"}
{"text":"Good hang! Friendly atmosphere and good food.  I've been here a couple times through the years and always liked it. This time I had beer and chicken wings. They feature their wings and with good reason, they're great! The feature lots of different sauces. From mild (BBQ) to extremely hot (Magma!). I got the classic buffalo wing sauce (Mild). The sauce was good and the wings were meaty!  Check their web site for the specials. Huge selection of beers!"}
{"text":"Of course I have experienced better. Amazingly poor food. Bad wings........absolutely amazingly poorly cooked, , sauces not well made and soups are worst than canned. No, even a tavern must be good. The Lizard chain is already too comfortable and has so much clientele that they are doing a sloppy job. No, I won't go back nor tell my friends."}
{"text":"Condescending waiter tells me that's iced tea when I said it had no taste.  Different shades of iceberg lettuce does not constitute mixed greens"}
{"text":"We have been coming at least once a week for the last two months. The wings and burgers are always fantastic. The wait staff is attentive and friendly. Winking Lizard is a wonderful addition to Avon."}
{"text":"My favorite Winking Lizard location, and I have been to most. Big, open, comfortable space and generally good bartenders.... even though a couple of the better ones left. Beer list is good, but has some garbage beer along with the good stuff. They have promotions that let you keep a glass with the purchase of a beer, with said beer's logo on it. Some of the glassware is nice, if you like that kind of thing. Not a huge fan of WL's food in general, but it isn't bad.   I don't like the parking lot here and try to street park, as the lot is big and it can be a hike to the front door.  I heard a Lizardville opened next door. I need to make a trip because the other Lizardville locations are sweet."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews here are rough. I have a friend that dislikes this place as well, but I never had a terrible time here. He food is average, but hope nobody comes here for fine dining. I would not come here during the week for lunch, it's packed. If you want the best service possible, sit at the bar. That may not always be the most comfy(or practical with a group), but I promise service will be faster. If nothing else the beer list is great and they always have the liquid crack from Willoughby."}
{"text":"Dropped by for the happy hour and ordered some chicken wing appetizers, they tout them as \"the best\" but mediocre is more like it.  Also ordered the full slab of St. Louis ribs, which were meaty enough but quite dry.  The sides were fine, but unimpressive.  I have been to many places like this... and this one is probably in the middle of the pack."}
{"text":"Ran in to the Winking Lizard and grabbed a turkey sandwich to go... it was quite tasty... so I was a happy camper... after all, the turkey sandwich had applewood smoked bacon... can't go wrong there!  However, I would come back and have a few beers and watch game... would not expect any major culinary event, so that's why I gave 3 stars..."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Winking Lizard, when I was working downtown for four years, I was a regular at that location.  I was super excited that there was a restaurant in Lakewood.  The service was okay, but I am a huge fan of the food.  Got the Strawberry Margarita with my meal and boy...that stuff made me SUPER happy lol (I wonder if it is influencing me to write this nice review? lol)  The staff was very helpful, nice and pleasant without being annoying.  Happy hour is from 3pm to7pm...no \"I need to get down there quick\" prices for the drinks but they are sooo strong and yummy.  Food was good but I am a fan of Winking Lizard (no negative feedback from me) and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is definitely a cool spot to meet up with friends and have a few drinks and watch a game.  I pretty much had everything on their menu.  I love their pizza and their sandwiches because they use garlic bread.  Sometimes it can get a little packed but that is just a small and minor issue."}
{"text":"Totally love this place.  Food is decent, service is very good, great selection of beers.  Plenty of TV's properly tuned to sports (and sometimes golf).  Love to just sit at the bar and dream about never going home"}
{"text":"I was here for a private event, a rehearsal dinner, and I was so impressed by everything. The staff did an impeccable job of keeping the buffet clean, serving drinks, and making sure everyone had what they needed. I was amazed at how fluidly and quickly they did everything. They even set up a DVD for the bride and groom that the guests watched on the multiple flat screen TVs. The space that we had was perfect--it's a secluded, v-shaped section of the restaurant that easily accommodated between 40 and 50 people for a seated meal. If you wanted to dance or anything like that, you'd need more space or fewer guests. The food was hit or miss, with a huge, fresh salad, delicious bbq chicken and ribs, and thick, house cut fries. The mac and cheese was not good at all (but I'm a snob with that) and the buffalo wings were lackluster. The hosts of the party paid for open bar and everyone was enjoying the vast array of beer, wine and cocktail options. I tried 3 different cocktails and each was great. I will probably never come to Cleveland again, but if I do, I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I love the Winking Lizard. The food is not going to be gourmet, so just know that now, but it's always good and the service is almost always great. I did the World Tour of Beers and it was so much fun. The vibe at this particular location is my favorite. SUCH  a cool building and a very big, fun bar area. Highly recommended if you're looking for a big, versitile American food menu. Very good specials and an amazing beer selection."}
{"text":"Went to the Lizard with the in laws on the day after Christmas for some pre-shopping eats.  It was packed!  I guess the entire Akron area decided to get out of the house and give the kitchen a break after cooking for Christmas Eve and Christmas.    I must say, the Lizard did not disappoint!  Although we did not imbibe with our lunch, there were plenty of good beers on the menu, including some craft beers...and Brooklyn Lager!  So we felt right at home. :-)  For lunch, I had a large \"Southwest\" chopped salad that had tortilla strips, corn, black beans, cheese, hard-boiled egg, and a ranch dressing.  I decided to swap out the ranch dressing for the house Italian.  For a bar salad, it was really delicious - perfectly fresh veggies, tender chicken, and great dressing.  I was impressed.  My sister-in-law got the same salad, but she asked for the black bean burger to top her salad instead of chicken.  This substitution was no problem, and they even chopped up the pieces of the bean burger to look like pieces of grilled chicken.  She said the bean burger was delicious as well.  My husband's broccoli and cheese soup was great - not too cheesy or creamy like at some other places in the area.  Tasted like they used fresh broccoli in the soup, as well.  Lastly, I was impressed that they made my father-in-law's chicken wings \"grilled, extra crispy\" instead of deep fried.  They were made to specification and came out perfectly.    In short, the waitstaff and cooks at the Winking Lizard did not disappoint - all of our special orders were made correctly and came out simultaneously.  The food tasted great and we enjoyed the ambiance and service."}
{"text":"It's not exceptional in any way, but they do have some good beers, and like Kevin N said, the beer special is inexpensive.  Actually there is something exceptional about it.  The live iguana."}
{"text":"Very huge beer selection, plenty of room, outdoor sidewalk seating, very good burgers and bbq ."}
{"text":"Place is just good.  I like this location only in the summer.  Prefer Penisula due to the character but the outdoor seating is nice.  Food is always great"}
{"text":"The bar staff is fantastic (Tony, Julez, Heather & Amy) every time! We recently had a small, but very rare, issue with how our food was prepared. Scott, the GM, came to talk to us right away and made it more than right. The level of customer service they all display is a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Carry out is terrible.  The cashier goes through order with you but does not open anything. When you get home something like salsa, sour cream etc is missing.   Food is okay but I would just choose one of the other 10 place in the area."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Cleveland for about 10 years, however whenever i come home to visit i know i'll have a good time at any of the chain of Winking Lizard Taverns. The bars have delicious wings (the BBQ sauce is amazing), tasty wraps, and an excellent selection of world beers.   If you're more interested in binging rather than sipping, they're more than happy to accomodate with gigantic happy hour half price jumbo beers. (domestic - around 44oz / $5).  The Lizard locations from Coventry, to Lakewood; Peninsula to Avon have tvs on tvs, good viewing areas, and many have beer gardens... all the makings of a great night.   I don't know what happened with the downtown location, but it does not deserve the Lizard moniker. Service was horrible. Our waittress was rude and dismissive. We had to wait for 40 minutes for a table after calling ahead. The seating arrangement was not optimal for watching the Browns preseason game... by that i mean we were in a corner trying to see over the corner to catch a glimpse of the score on the tv on the other side of the bar.  Bad branch, fantastic chain... go to lakewood!!!"}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, so I don't get to Cleveland all that often. I found Winking Lizard a number of years back after I took a tour of the ballpark. I liked the food, it was lunchtime and I did not have drinks. The burger was excellent and the staff was great.   If I get within a reasonable distance of Cleveland, I'm there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were  in town for the baseball game (Go Yankees!!) We came here for a bite to eat and a drink.  It was around 10:30p.m. but the place was still pretty busy. The hostess was very nice and got us a high top table rather quickly.  Our waitress was sub-par and seemed to be distracted and irritated.  We ordered an appetizer (pickle chips) and small deluxe pizza. They were \"okay.\"  I got a Long Island and my husband got a beer. Again, sub-par."}
{"text":"Maybe it was late or the chicken was old but bland with the sauces. Nachos? Not sure what those were too much cheese. I probably should have not gotten take out. Food like this should be eaten in house and not take out. I was a bit disappointed after the first bite. I had high expectations for 20 plus spent on 20 wings and some nachos."}
{"text":"Always a good time at this Winking Lizard. The food is pretty good and the staff are excellent. TVs all around and a good atmosphere. I prefer bdub wing sauces, but the wings here aren't bad. I usually end up getting their glass of the month, which makes for a great collection at home. We come here to watch games, especially college football, and get their spinach and artichoke dip (which is huge!) as an appetizer. The staff are never pushy, and people who are here always seem enthusiastic but polite and good natured - so this tends to be our go-to bar."}
{"text":"Big fans of the Lizard.  Love wing night, beer selection and of course the popcorn. Will always return.  We forgive the occasional bad day."}
{"text":"If you come here expecting top-tier bar food, you will not be disappointed.  The menu is full of traditional pub items including pizza, BBQ, sandwiches and, of course, wings!  Their wing variety is solid and the sauces are yummy.  I believe the Lizard ranks third in the local Cleveland area behind BW3 and Quaker Steak, but it's still worth the trip if you set your expectations appropriately.    P.S. They also have awesome 36 OZ beer specials!"}
{"text":"Chain bar food. Nothing special. Service was terrible at lunch. Our server, Matt told us the wrong special twice and got an attitude with us when we pointed it out. He denied he said the wrong thing. The guy insisted he said the correct item each time. With how few people were there at lunch, you'd think he would have had a better attitude.   Your money would be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this location converted from Winks to Winking Lizard. While the ownership is the same, the menu and food quality was a notch above with Winks. WL has a ton of beers but the draft selection at Winks was much better. WL has too many standard no-rotating handles."}
{"text":"The Lizard is my solid standby when I'm in downtown Cleveland. There is noting fancy about this joint, and their menu feels like they are trying to do a little to much, but if you're looking for a casual comfortable hole-in-the-wall, this is a good one. The burgers and wings are good, they have plenty of TV's to watch the games, great beer selection, and the service is pretty good too. This isn't a trendy 4th Street, TV Chef, micro-brew, which some reviewers seem to have thought. Set realistic expectations and you'll like this place."}
{"text":"I live close by and go here once a week outside just open so took our dog well no dogs allowed. So we left I wait till outside took picture of front of store and manager. Well he yelled and followed me out caused major issues at home so thank you not going here plus you mister manger blond hair keep a look out.  Lol not a friendly place"}
{"text":"I am torn about this.  I came to this location twice.  I sat at a table once and the bar once.  The table service was pretty good.  The bar service was not up to par.  So lets talk about my day at the bar.  One I came because they were advertising and event for Cleveland Beer Week which was \"A Taste of Bavaria\".  Only to get there and no one at the bar knew about this event.  I thought, \"That is strange\"  I did not see anything around to advertise the event...until I went to the restroom and there was a poster on the wall and on that poster was a list of events for Winking Lizards and the word \"Cancelled\" was written over it with pen (see photo).  So I ordered a glass of Mead because you can not find Mead down south.  Then I wanted to order a flight or paddle as the Lizard calls it.  Paddles are $7, not bad.  So the bar tender gave me a list of beers on tap that I was able to order for the paddle.  I ordered my four beers for the paddle which were fine.  Then the bill came in.  Mead for $7 as the menu stated...then the paddle beers were itemized and it cost $10.25.  I asked the bar tender and he said that due to Cleveland Beer Week the prices are different.  I was like, \"That would of been good to know\"  He looked at me and laughed and said I guess I should of said something.  Well, no shit.  False advertisement.  I order something for $7 and charged $10.25.  And then there was no sorry or even anything else.  Kind of disheartening.  Good place, poor service and employees."}
{"text":"The best bar in Coventry for chilling with some drink and food with friends.  They have a great selection of rotating drafts, and a huge collection of bottled drinks.  Their menu has excellent bar food at very reasonable prices.  Come on a work night and there'll be some sort of deal on food (pizza, wings, ribs, or burgers), and beer.  My friends and I would frequent this location for wings and brews on Tuesday evenings after a hard day in the classroom.  Definitely take advantage of their glass-of-the-month deal too.  For a buck or two more, you get to have your beer in a neat logo-ed glass that you get to keep afterwards.  I've collected about 10 of these, and they're great for parties.  Don't expect to work your game here though, as the atmosphere is like that of a casual sports restaurant.  They do have bar seating, but it is typically occupied by older people relaxing after a hard day's work.  All and all, a great place for hanging out and catching up with friends."}
{"text":"This place was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at. We decided to come here because it was close and there was so much traffic. They weren't too busy and seated us right away. They have a large menu with many options so I had a hard time narrowing it down. We ordered the Lizard Freckles and they came out right away they were delicious and the horseradish ranch had just the right amount of zing too it. I got the Ruben sandwich and fries my boyfriend got the pulled BBQ chicken melt. They were huge sandwiches and so many fries that were so crispy and good! They had a large selections of different beers you could get which was very impressive for their beer tour promotion that they had.  I was stuffed after that meal and was very satisfied. They services was great always making sure our drinks were filled and that we had everything that we needed. Next time I am in the area I will be back to try something else yummy off their menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because it was the first place that was open closest to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. And I wasn't expecting Cajun food. We were seated right away in a back seating area. The venue is quite large with lots of TVs playing various sports channels. Our server was quick and attentive, although there was a long wait for our food - granted the place was pretty busy. The jerk chicken sandwich was good, but I did expect it to be a lot spicer. Although I didn't indulge, there's a decent drink menu with some speciality cocktails and plenty of beer."}
{"text":"My daughter had mentioned that she liked the ribs at Winking Lizard, and since I'm a ribs kind of guy, I stopped in last night to give them a shot.  I had the baby back ribs, cole slaw, and baked beans along with water w/ lemon.  The ribs were  a little rough for my taste, and adhered too stringently to the bone.  The meat itself was not as tender as I would have liked.  The BBQ sauce was good.  They provided two lemon-scented wipes for post-dining clean-up.    The surprise hit for me was the baked beans.  I'll definitely have those again.  Tasty,  complimented with onions and bacon.  Service was good, even though the place was packed.    The full rack of ribs cost about $18, which is fairly reasonable.  I think if I were to give the dish another shot, I'd do a half-rack and compliment it with something else."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, fast service, cold beer, manager (Joe) was real friendly and checked in on every person.       I love coming to this bar to watch games with friends or to just enjoy a nice dinner.  One of the best winking lizards in the area!"}
{"text":"Everything was really great! Loved the food-- The live lizard really entertained my baby girl!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to meet up with friends and co-workers. Every time I am here the food has been great. With a great beer selection that will make you return. Lori in the bar area has done a great job and very attentive to our needs. Definitely worth the trip.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I pretty much exclusively come here for cheap wings on Mondays and Tuesdays. That being said, as time goes by, everything goes up in price. :( They're now 50c/wing (in packs of 5) for bone-in, and 45c for boneless after 3pm Mon and Tues. Although, guys, I really don't understand \"boneless wings\"...aren't they just chicken tenders?  Anyway, the last time I came here was over a year ago, and since then, they've added more flavors. There's now a flavor spicier than magma (it's called fire in the hole), and there are dry rubs available now. My favorite flavor is goldfinger. Try it, you won't regret it. :D  Happy hour specials are also available from 3-7pm, including $1 off all 22oz drafts and other deals."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff! I cant even explain how important it is to know about the  beer you are serving when  you have such a amazing selection! first thing I saw when I sat at the bar was the wall of beer \"the heavens opened up and a sudden thirst came on\" I was amazed so many yumms I want to try! I could have stayed all day! I had a few beers but my fav was the vanilla beer it was so different and delightful I often  get cravings for this beer and can not find it anywhere?! The bathrooms were stanky and the floors were sticky but other than that I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Good sports bar with good bar food & a friendly staff.  Over twenty wings sauces & great burgers. A wide selection of draft & bottle beers as well.  My wife & I shared the burger, wings & a salad and our waiter served them up split.  Great Experience."}
{"text":"I have always preferred Winking Lizard to other places (Panini's), as they have not only a better beer selection but also a more vast and yummy selection of food. Their wings are great. The three of us sat at the bar at lunchtime and ordered the pulled pork sandwich, steak wrap, and bbq wings. Bartender was our server and was quite knowledgeable about food/beer pairings-I'm a fan of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale now! Overall, a good experience at lunchtime on a weekday."}
{"text":"I waiver between 3 and 4 stars, but anywhere with a dive feel and good beer will always get a least 4 stars from me.  Don't let the strip mall location deceive you. When I walked in, I practically fell in love. This would so totally be the type of place I'd hang out if I actually lived in the area.  It completely embodies that dive feel. But yet, is clean and has restrooms that don't make you want to flee to the nearest hospital. And then there's the beer - a very nice selection of beer. They have a great selection of drafts, plus a menu of 25 or so bottles. While not part of the happy hour special, as soon as I saw 21st Amendment (one of the greatest breweries I have ever had the privilege of being a regular of) Watermelon Wheat, I was sold. Such a find completely made my day. And it is an excellent beer to pair with wings (which are $0.40 on Mondays and Tuesdays).  So I, of course, had to order the wings (after all, I do always opt for the wings when given the choice). There is minimum of 5 per order on Mondays and Tuesdays. I opted for 5 of the Hot and 5 of the Thai (which are supposed to, according the thermometer on their menu, be one of their hottest sauces). I requested both blue cheese and ranch on the side. And ordered a side of french fries with the honey mustard wing sauce.  Once my food arrived (and good thing I opted for a table and not sitting at the bar - I needed the space with all this food), the wings looked great. Big, meaty, and saucy. These were definitely not your average $0.40 bar wings. But alas, neither the Hot or Thai were actually spicy or hot. I guess I should have gone with the 911. But they were good sauces, especially the Thai. I appreciated the different flavors going on. Sadly, though, the blue cheese and ranch were just pre-packaged dipping cups. Ick. The fries were ok, but I wouldn't order them again. And the honey mustard wing sauce tasted just like honey mustard salad dressing. Ick. But it was all pretty cheap, and I certainly had no problems eating all the wings, so I guess I can't really complain.  And again, the beers...so great. Dogfish Head, Goose Island, etc., etc. - and all on draft! I could've spent all night drinking here. And also, again, the place itself is great. I loved the vibe and dive feel of it. It totally worked."}
{"text":"I have been fortunate enough to travel the world a little bit, and because of this, I have been to a wide array of restaurants of different types.  Even when I was across the world eating fine European cuisine, I CRAVED a Big Ed Burger and Fries from The Winking Lizard.  There is nothing better than this incredibly filling (that's an understatement), meaty, heavenly burger.  Their wings are also my preference 10 times out of 10, no matter where I am.  Within a week of returning from traveling abroad, I was ate at the Winking Lizard three times, and I could have gone back more and not been upset about it.  Sorry I'm not sorry.  This place has the best comfort food I have ever eaten, and it feels like home to me.  The atmosphere is also great, as you can catch any sports game that you desire while chowing down on some incredible wings or burgers.   Oh, and it is incredibly affordable, too!"}
{"text":"I live a block away from this place and since I enjoy beer and bar food I've been here about a thousand times. And yes, I have driven that one block before. It gets cold in the winter.   The Lakewood location is in a pretty cool building. The space is huge with some nice outdoor seating available. They also have outdoor TV's that I like to look at when I run by in the summer. I don't think that's really a relevant detail, I just want everyone to know that I exercise (if no one knows you do it then what's the point). Like all Wink locations they have a gigantic beer list that can be a little overwhelming. Honestly, I usually select beers randomly based on how \"cool\" I perceive the name to be. The wait staff can usually help you out with that a little bit, but it's a huge list so asking them for recommendations almost seems cruel. I've had my fair share of mixed drinks here and I've always felt they were a little weak, but in their defense it's probably a proper pour which is certainly less than what I'm pouring at home.  The food at the Winking Lizard is always going to be decent. I've never had a bad meal there, but I don't know that I've had something so fantastic that I feel the need to specifically mention it in a Yelp review. I've walked here to eat alone before which was pretty sad, but I can tell you I certainly wouldn't have done that if I didn't enjoy their food. I would also like to note that I have a small obsession with their BBQ sauce. I use it instead of ketchup with their fries and I even throw it on their popcorn because I am a disgusting individual and I have no respect for my body. Long story short, the BBQ sauce is good.   Final verdict: The Wink in Lakewood is a good place for casual beers and bar food, even dinner alone if you're a lonely individual like that. Put the BBQ sauce on your popcorn, I swear it's good. Then play drunken skeeball. That's a solid evening right there. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"After a 2 mile long walk this was a perfect way to end the night. Great for kids and parents. The complimentary popcorn was a hit with the hungry kiddos. Just what they needed to take the hunger edge off. We had burgers, pizza, and corn dogs but there was a wide variety of food. And OMG, the selection of adult drinks was incredible.  It's directly across from the baseball and basketball stadiums so it would be perfect for pregaming."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home and I don't even live in this neighborhood. Love this place staff is nice and I have made a lot of friends with being a regular."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today.  It is GORGEOUS outside so I wanted to dine outdoors.  I sat out on the covered bar.  It was just me today so I had a quick salad and a beer.  The salad was ok, nothing to write home about, but it was SPEEDY!  I cannot complain about the speed or the service.  I was in and out under an hour which is what I needed for my lunch break.  The one the that SUCKED was the parking lot.  They share a lot w/ La Quinta Motel and apparently La Quinta doesn't want to share and will tow you.  I ended up having to design my own parking place because the lot was full.  Will I go back?  ABSOLUTELY.  I love this outdoor patio space!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after an Indians game and were impressed with the service and the food. We ordered the Mac and cheese bites...AMAZING!!! For dinner I had the turkey burger modified with mushrooms and Swiss cheese and it was to die for. My husband had wings and a house salad. He said they were great and lots of sauce choices. Will definitely go back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I come here for the huge beer list and the indoor/outdoor patio. The food is average but after a few beers from that list the food gets yummier. This time I stopped by for Christmas in July because this is one of the awesome places that puts cinnamon sugar on the rim."}
{"text":"Great new place in the area. Love the atmosphere, selection of beers, and great service. Will be enjoying this establishment year round! Prices are very reasonable as well!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Tried to go here on a Thursday night for dinner but they wouldn't let me in since it was 5 o'clock and I'm not 21 yet. What a shame. Go to the one on Coventry, nicer people and they let me in since I frequently go!"}
{"text":"Excellent good and atomsphere.... Great pre game dinner. Excellent service, considering the amount of patrons."}
{"text":"Good Food Great Drinks.  Decent number of TVs to watch sports.  Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Great service.  Quiet sports bar. Very different than this Cali girl is used to on a Thursday night. Loaded Perogies... can I take them back to Cali with me?!!!"}
{"text":"Our hotel staff recommended the Lizard as a great place to go before the Cav's game.  They had $4.25 32oz draft beers and Monday & Tuesday's are $.50 wing night. We ordered 10 spicy BBQ and 10 garlic parm wings and a small pizza. We only waited about 15 minutes for all of our food to come out. Very impressed with the wings, they packed a double punch in the heat and flavor department and were filling. I would recommend and go back next time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I would go back if someone wanted to but it wouldn't be my idea. We ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and our waitress came back with \"five\" regular pickles lol. My girlfriend also asked for a side of ranch with her buffalo wrap and they substituted the buffalo sauce for ranch. They do have a big beer list but that was just about it for me."}
{"text":"average food.....the dining room was like a cafeteria style restaurant, kinda like where the actors on *the wire* eat....just no intimacy.  Waitstaff was very average at best.  Either overwhelmed or uninterested, but just didnt leave a reason for a return visit.  Food was decent, just nothing to honestly write home about.  Hot wings heavy with vinegar, blue shroom burger came out medium well even though requested medium rare.  Very dry.  The Maui Maui sandwich was good, just a very small portion.    Give it a try, maybe you will do better than we did..."}
{"text":"NEW LOCATION SUCKS! Have tried to eat there 3 times and always way to many people in a small crowded \"waiting area\"! So we've left three times. I guess the location in Lakewood will always get our business!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. I asked for a table for one as I stare at 4 open tables. This leaves a lot to be desired. I won't try here again on a business trip!! Waste of my time"}
{"text":"I love winking lizards. Had my 28th Birthday party at one, ha ha. Biggest mistake this one ever made was moving. The place on Ghent was the bomb. This place is the m80 , VERY STINKY everything. I think the server I've had the past few times was using some sort of narcotic. Looked like a wild raccoon who just escaped an abandoned house fire. I am sick of giving this place a chance. Not worth any wait. Would rather drive to baltimore to eat a dead toad off the sidewalk.  Sickening Seed-"}
{"text":"Me and my better half were going to the playhouse and didn't really think about where we were going to dinner. We went to a few places around the theater and they had about an hour wait. And so, to Yelp we went. And there was the Lizard about a 5 minute walk away. Not even far enough away to make me consider carrying my heels. And I loves me some wings! It really is a great location if you're going downtown, but I couldn't imagine trying to find a parking space on the street nearby. If you're downtown already, make the short walking trip here.   We were carded at the door and seated right away. The waitress was friendly and came almost right away. Its a smaller restaurant, but comfortable. We told her we were in a bit of a hurry and she had no problem adapting. We both got wings (boneless for me, have to keep my dress clean) and an order of fries to share. I suggest the Spicy Garlic (my favorite.) Another thing I noticed was that it wasn't as loud as the other Winking Lizards I've been to.  It really is a nice place, especially for an impromptu  dinner before a night at the playhouse or after a game at Progressive or the Q."}
{"text":"Nice place to get some wings, sandwich or a cold beer. Bar area has plenty of TVs and the outside patio area has a separate bar and ample seating area."}
{"text":"Love this place always very nice ..food always great... Love watching the buckeyes there on a satuday afternoon ... Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food:  Typical for a bar menu.  No reason to order a salad here.  Wings are above average.  Fries are diet-busting delicious (cheese and bacon, please).  Beer selection:  Excellent.  If you're in the area for the long haul, sign up for the Beer Tour and get your name in lights (or more likely on a white board).  Bathrooms:  One of two towel rolls never works.  It's magic.  Ambience:  Restaurant is consistently busy any night of the week (probably due to the lack of other things to do in Akron and the several nearby hotels).  My recommendations:  Come with a group.  Sit at the bar.  Try the free popcorn and the Breckenridge Vanilla Porter.  Side note:  Will find Steelers fans here on gamedays"}
{"text":"I'm between 3 and 4 stars for this venue.  We had a party of 12 eat, and the service was brisk, and the food was reasonably tasty -- fairly standard bar fare, however.  Extensive beer list, and casual decor and ambiance are expected, as well as the TVs and local colour.  Don't expect to be blown away -- but it's solid."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend would always talk about this tavern that he goes to, so when I came to visit him, we went here for a late night dinner.   They have a large sitting area; it's not just a stand-alone bar, thank god. Awesome funky decor with weird posters on the wall (A lot of them were wrapped in christmas wrapping for the holidays, shame.) There was also an iguana just chilling in a glass cage. I see what they did thereeeee :)  The girl who helped us out was really attentive because it wasn't that busy that night. They were out of a lot of holidays beers because it was nearing the end of December and they weren't restocking as much. I had a long island iced tea, and it was actually probably the best i've ever had. And I've had a lot of them.   For food, we got the wings with thai sauce. I thought they'd be spicer than they were, considering how high up it was on the hot meter, but it's actually not that spicy. The wings are super crispy, and I think I ate more of them than my boyfriend did. Whoops.  We also had the pot roast sandwich. Ahmazing, with ahmazing friesssss. I was in total omnomnom mood. Lots of food for not that expensive pricing. Whee :)   The mister and I watched some football while we were here. There are a lot of screens in the sitting area, which was nice as well."}
{"text":"Nice place overall! Great selection of beers! Friendly atmosphere which makes things even better. Nice menu, a lot of stuff on it but taste isn't there. Friendly staff makes it a cool place to spend some time with both friends or family!"}
{"text":"So many memories here at the Wink!  Here are some things that I like about this place:  - They show Michigan games, and you can always count on seeing at least one other fan here on football Saturdays wearing maize and blue - They have $0.40 wing nights on Mondays AND Tuesdays! Bf and I tried eating a total of 35 b/c we thought they would be small... wrong. We couldn't do it. - They have a really great selection of draught beverages and beer from all over the world. This was the first place I tried Lambic. - It's always a lively place where a lot of young professionals come to hang out after work! - Classic, unpretentious pub. Good service, except when the waitresses wear OSU jerseys."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! 1st time here and being a beer snob was very pleased by the choices   The bar tender was knowledgable and when I told him I was a hop head he picked some great suggestions. Food on the other had was not what I expected from other reviews. Boneless wings were tasty but darn near broke a tooth. The dry rub Cajun (a suggestion) were a bit better. I also expected more from the blue cheese served in a plastic peal top container. Fresh would be much better. Overall I might have given a 4 if not for the rock hard boneless wings. Great beer kept me here for another."}
{"text":"Pretty much your average sports bar. The food I had was delicious but the service was slow. They have free popcorn so you can just munch on that and order a drink at the bar. If you don't sit at te bar it's okay because they have TVs everywhere. You could see the tv from any angle. But I had lunch there. I had the BBQ western burger and I was pleased with it and their steak fries were very good. I would go again!"}
{"text":"My buddy from France and I went there tonight, and as always they had a checkpoint at the door like it's some sort of exclusive high-security joint and not the average sports bar that it is.  He showed them his ID from France and the bouncer (for real, at a sports bar) said he wouldn't accept it.  My friend and I have been going to bars around Cleveland all summer long and he's never had a problem using a French ID, so clearly this is the Wink's problem and not ours.  The bouncer dude said he didn't have any way to know whether it was real or not because French IDs weren't in their book -- that's your problem, not ours.  I guess there are several ID-checking books out there and the Wink cut corners by buying the cheapest one and hoping that no foreigners ever tried to patronize it.  He also said my friend should go home and get his passport, like we're going to take our passports to go watch the Cavs.  We were not allowed in.  Not even to just get food or watch the game.  Get real, we're going to have a beer and watch ESPN, not take out a bank loan or enter a foreign country.  There's no need to be such a dick when it's your fault you can't verify an ID.  Like Cami said in her review, it's easy enough to just put a mark on someone's hand or tell the waitress not to serve him alcohol.  We proposed these and other middle-ground solutions (including simply Googling the standard guide for checking a French ID since that's what they were missing) and they just refused to listen or even have a conversation about it.  Needless to say, we won't be going back.  I used to go every few weeks but tonight they lost my friends and I as customers.  For what it's worth, we just went up the road to another bar to watch the game and didn't have any trouble at all with the French ID.  The Wink just thinks it's special.  How about they learn what acceptable customer service is, and try to treat their regular customers with some common decency instead of just putting a hand in my face."}
{"text":"I like this particular location. Wait staff is decent. Food always prepared as expected. Great beer selection. (This a definite theme in my ratings...beer selection!)  Good location. Cool, historic building.  I enjoy this location.  I really love the building. The \"Lizard\" part is the same from place to place.. IMHO.  The buildings are usually what make them interesting.  Go here.  Enjoy the history.  Drink a beer."}
{"text":"Good beer and upscale bar food.  Who doesn't love Monday nights when wings are 50 cents and small cheese pizza is 5 something.  Then throw in the amazing craft beer list, and tons of sport channels and you got a great place to spend a Monday night.  Go ahead and extend that weekend one extra day."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean wrap without chicken because I'm a vegetarian.. when i asked to try dressing to add to the dry wrap I was told no. I basically had to pick one. I tried the balsamic .. it was ok.. but charge me $.80 ? And I didn't get chicken? I'll be back to enjoy the patio but the management has a few customer service things to learn.. not the servers fault. She was great and felt bad that I couldn't try more than one to decide."}
{"text":"great food & fun"}
{"text":"Just a solid bar and a great time with co workers after a long few days of work."}
{"text":"The Lizard is my favorite Cleveland Heights area bar, and my husband and I are usually here once a week. I love that there are two separate bars, and we usually choose the back bar (maybe because of its proximity to the popcorn machine). We usually have really good service, and the they have a fantastic beer selection that changes each month. The food is also really good-I recommend the Caribbean wings, chicken BBQ sandwich, and burgers. They have cheap weekday food specials and also rotate a monthly food specials menu that's based off of the current season or holidays.  Love the World Tour of Beers, and they are always willing to change a TV to whatever sport we want to watch (including Nashville Predators hockey games)!"}
{"text":"Glad we stopped here. The service was the best and the food was excellent. We sat out on the patio and it was a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the American burger and it was incredibly good! My husband and his friend had the burning river burger and were nearly on the floor from how hot it was... My husband had an ice cube in his mouth for 30 minutes and his friend was literally sweating bullets... Make sure to ask for a glass of milk if you order this because it is hot as SHIT"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place as far as places on Coventry go.  Not a bad beer selection.  The key is finding a month in which they have chosen a good beer as the special.  Otherwise, it's just another pub or sports bar."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great specials! I recommend you get the Oreo Dessert and share it. The only negative thing is people under 21 aren't allowed with out parental supervision after 5. I'm 20 but can pass for about 25 with the right hair and makeup so I don't often get caught unless I go with my younger looking friends."}
{"text":"So my experience started with my entire table reviewing menus and I did not get one. Then we're told we had to have an adult with us to sit at the table, which was never explained to us. Then we get our waitress, who did not introduce herself, and she was not in the greatest mood. Then my entire table got there food and my food came ten minutes later after I told them that they had forgotten my meal. The food was good, but the service could be better."}
{"text":"We were there on a night they had a wing special -- 55 cents each, you need to order in batches of five and you have to pay extra for celery and ranch or blue cheese dressing.  My husband is a big fan of chicken wings so he was happy to order those.  I ordered a Mediterranean wrap with grilled veggies as a side (I could have had fries instead of the veggies).  It seemed like almost all the tables around us were ordering the wings and they waitress actually thanked me for not ordering wings!  My husband enjoyed his wings and my wrap was very good.  My only complaint is how long it took us to get our food!  Such simple orders shouldn't have taken more than half an hour to fill, even on a busy night.  I'm sure we will be back to either this location or one of the Winking Lizard's many other locations.  There lots of great items on the menu and it's a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat prior to a Cavs basketball game. Complimentary popcorn while you wait. Recommend going early if going prior to a game. We had a party of 3 and arrived at 5:30 pm and did not get sat until 6:15 pm. Expect to wait a little longer for larger parties.  They have no reservations or quote wait times. The service was prompt and food came quickly.   Food was surprisingly yummy. I ordered the Mesa salad, a savory dressing with tortillas on top for a nice crunch. Corn, black beans and chicken made the salad pretty filing.  Will go again."}
{"text":"What more can you really ask for in a sports bar?  Great beer selection and solid food.  I enjoyed the ribs more than I thought.  The wings are solid, not spectacular.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service. Came here after terrible service down the street. Brendan greeted us r"}
{"text":"Comfortable environment, good food, friendly staff, large bar but also nice, separate dining area.  HUGE beer selection - one of the best you'll find.  Great wings and other misc food de americana.  I would personally stay away from the Taco Salad - below average but their chili is quite good as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular Winking Lizard and it will be my last. Service was slow and sloppy. I ordered a half slab of bbq ribs and I couldn't have been more disappointed. They were overdone and had barely any meat on them. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Winking Lizard after the power went out at our hotel. Winking Lizard has a bar and many tvs on the sports channels.  We were greeted by a thin and fragile waitress. She must have been in her 60s, and had a hippie aura. She was attentative and served us well. I ordered the crab cake special, and they were really good! I received four medallions, and it came with a sauce. The crab cakes did not have a lot of breading or stuffing. I could taste the crab, bell peppers, and onions.   My co-worker ordered the Magma Chicken Wings. Magma is considered the hottest spiciness on the menu. When he ate two wings, his lips were red and swollen. I tried the chicken wings and they were spicy!! I could feel my lips swelling too. I ate 5-6 chicken wings since I would never go to a place that has a Magma spiciness again.   Overall, the food is cheap and the beer list is huge! I think over 100 beers is available at the bar."}
{"text":"I'm adding a star more than the last time I reviewed this place. It will never be 5 stars because the food is not 5 star food. But there are a lot of things to love about this place and it's really grown on me. I've never had a wait. I've always had great service. The prices! They have specials throughout the week like Tuesday a small pizza is $5 (or $4.50 can't remember) and 50 cents per additional topping. That's pretty good. I think there is a $5 any burger night too. They have a really great beer selection, I've been getting the Lagunitas Lil Sumpin Sumpin on draft lately and I highly recommend it. Some of their food is pretty bad like a couple sandwiched I've had and a Po Boy that was a special once, the onion rings. But some things are good like get a side of veggies instead of the fries and they are cooked perfectly and in a light italian kinda sauce. And the pizza and burgers I've had there are good. They have more tvs than anywhere to watch a game and a really great outdoor patio for the summer. I like coming here because I'm not thinking about how much money I'm spending, they have good beers and it's a nice laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, nice and helpful staff, great menu and the food was quite tasty! Lots of beers to choose from.   The beer cheese fries were quite good, very rich! Perfect for sharing.   Sit outside on a nice day or inside to watch the sports stuff."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and was very pleased!  Great selection of beers.  Had the pretzel with beer cheese appetizer and got 2 huge soft pretzels that were very tasty.  Also had chicken wings and they were maybe the best I've had.  Had the bourbon style and parm garlic and they were great.  Big, fresh meaty wings.  Staff was awesome. Josh gave me a short history of the building which was interesting.  Glad I went, and would certainly go again if I go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  The menu has been redesigned so that it can be jam-packed with full page ads!  There is literally a giant advertisement on each left hand page.  As there are at least 5 or 6 ads, this makes the menu way too huge and INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.  I'd like to puke up greasy bar food on the person that decided on such a low class and absolutely money hungry move at the expense of their customers!  Now for my original review...  THE UP-SIDE:  Really large open space, cool atmosphere, many types of beer, and good bar food.  If you're looking for a place for a party, you can even rent out the bowling alley in the basement!   THE DOWN-SIDE: It's just a bar with some okay food; no great shakes.   THE SUM-IT-UP: Not a bad place to hang out with some friends and have some pretty decent bar food."}
{"text":"This Winking Lizard is contained in a series of connected rooms along Coventry Road.   It is usually fairly busy at night and during sporting events, so plan accordingly. There's free popcorn in the second room to your right as you enter, and follow the main hallway all the way to the end to find the bathrooms on your left. Cell phone reception can be spotty in here, so pay attention if you're trying to meet up with people."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Winking Lizard locations, except the Avon location. It is too small and cramped. There is little to no waiting area. My son is 6'6\" and had to wait outside the first and last time we went there to eat. The food is great, just too close for comfort at this location. I really miss the old/closed Avon location."}
{"text":"While the wings are still great the service was poor and they were generous enough to give me two dinky pieces of celery with my wing order and when I inquired the server said \"that's what you get\"."}
{"text":"Great place for good food, quick service, and lively atmosphere. You can get free popcorn while you wait for lunch!! Quick walk from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame too!! The prices for lunch were reasonable!"}
{"text":"When we asked around about places to eat before the Cavs game, they all said the Winking Lizard Tavern. So of course, we went there.  I was surprised by the size of the menu - it almost felt cheesecake factory-esque, with the environment and ambiance of a regular pub.  We ordered the mac and cheese balls and wings, both of which were perfect portion sizes for 2 people and filled us up just in time to enjoy the Cavs game.  If you're looking for something quick, relatively affordable, and delicious, you should definitely come here. Also, this particular location was great due to the fact  that it's so close to the Q and Progressive Field."}
{"text":"The coolest thing about this unique winking lizard location is the bowling alley in the basement. Talk about a sweet deal! $500 for five hours and it's all yours for a private party!  Monday and Tuesday wing night, wings are average..."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection..... Check.  Bar food, average...... Check  Friendly service..... Hell no.  Now I have been here many times but the service seems to be getting worse and worse. When food comes out and we are still waiting for a napkin or fork....not good. And don't look at me like I'm crazy when you ask how everything is and I say I wouldn't know since I haven't tried it yet, I need a napkin and fork.   Bottom line, go if you want to try some beers but expect to be frustrated with the service."}
{"text":"I've avoided Winking Lizard ever since moving to Cleveland because I was told they specialize in two things:  wings and beer, both of which I do not like.  I ended up having dinner here the other night and was pleasantly surprised with the menu.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, which was delicious!  Juicy chicken, perfect crust, sweet onions and a perfectly tangy sauce.  Also, our server was really nice and definitely earned her tips.  I doubt I'd choose Winking Lizard again (if I had a choice) but it's nice to know that apparently they do more than just wings and beer well."}
{"text":"sports bar...  stopped here while i was in town for a wedding to pick up a quick bite, so i'll make this quick. my water was empty more often than not, as was the case for the rest of the party. very very sub par service. the food was quite forgettable, but then again, it's a bar (i promise i will not go to another bar for food again, damn it.). i had some utterly forgettable wings, and one of us didn't even get his food brought out to him with the rest of the food. place is not good, though i bet it's decent to watch fights here.  eric b"}
{"text":"Thursday night at Winking Lizard lakewood is well -- whatever is to be expected. Fairly busy but always able to find a table. Friend and myself grabbed a two-top in the bar. Service was spotty, always a good beer selection though. Food-wise, well I'm a very picky eater, but for a Lizard it was satisfying. Food came out fast, cooked to my specs, and even tasted decent. Just a burger and fries on special paired with Leinenkugel.   Will definitely keep going to hang, eat, drink and watch sports with friends."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab dinner. Food was very good and the prices were reasonable. Nice selection of good beers and the service was friendly and prompt. I will go back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Winking Lizard is yet another place that I don't fully get all the bashing about.  I came after an Indians game in early September and thoroughly enjoyed it.  They have an unexpected beer list that is quite good, and prices are exceptional, even on non-beer drinks.  Maybe this is a standard price point for Cleveland, but coming from DC this was a HUGE difference.  The drink list and menu are both massive.  As far as atmosphere, it was pretty laid back and we had no difficulty getting seated near a TV to watch the VT vs Alabama game.  The place seems so long and vast and seems to never end.  Many different nooks with a combo of tables, pub tables, booths, and a rather long bar.    For food, my group of 4 all shared some appetizers which were fine and then got entrees a little while later.  Food was pretty typical and unremarkable.  To me, the draw are the beers and the prices.  It's a good spot to watch a game or come to hang out at after an Indians game.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This is a great, and enormous, sports bar in Lakewood. There are tons of tvs, the food is pretty good and there is a massive beer selection.   I recommend spikes on your shoes if it's winter, getting up or down the hill to parking is treacherous in the snow, but there is tons of parking in the grocery behind it, and tons of parking is always a plus."}
{"text":"Went here after the game and order the wild western burger mid rare what a disappoint it says never frozen but it tasted  like it was and it was a unseasoned bland mess will come back for the awesome onion rings but not the burger"}
{"text":"Been to Winks a few times for the drafts. Mostly local drafts which were good. The atmosphere is nice. Lots of tv for sporting events.   Split burger and wings with the wife. The menu is simple menu of the winking lizard. Good service  Burger is really good and tasty and finally order a burger that was cooked the way I order it.  Medium Rare which I usually get medium or well. Was happy finally got a burger the way I order it.   Wings were ok. Order the Jamaican Jerk and really had not a lot of taste. Ask for addition sauce and the bartender told me he had to charge us additional .5o cents for the sauce. Thought that was crazy since thy were already charging $10 dollars for the wings. Was kind of surprised on the additional charge.   Good place think they have to loosen up and advertise more to get the place rolling. Otherwise it's just a high scale winking lizard with high prices and a limited menu with no specials."}
{"text":"My father in law always wanted to have an Irish Wake when he passed on. His time came recently and we chose the Winking Lizard to host an Irish Wake to celebrate his love of life, laughter and family. The staff at the Winking Lizard could not have been more accommodating, from delicious food, help with arranging the room, and friendly staff. Thank you so much for your help with honoring my father in laws request."}
{"text":"Our server was great. Very nice and understood the menu very well. We ate in the bar area. It was very loud and annoying at times. Next time we will ask for the other side of the \"wall\". I am trying to understand why they put that there. Maybe fire code or noise issue? Seems like two separate places. I will be back. Bummed they have no Tator tots."}
{"text":"The wings were dry and rubbery. I think they fried them a second time after they sat under a heat lamp. We told the waitress about it and she just walked away. Poor service and really bad wings.  Update: An owner contacted me about the issue. He apologized, said he'd have the issue addressed, and offered me a gift card."}
{"text":"Lamest Lizard on the planet  ... can't even make popcorn ... you ask them and they don't care"}
{"text":"First, a big kudos to the management team of all the Lizards -- they've taken the step of adding nutrition information to their online menu, something most restaurants are very reluctant to do. While I'll be shocked at how many calories I stuff into my face when it comes out, I'm glad they're taking this step toward letting people be aware (or negligent) of their own nutrition.  I do enjoy the Lizard. I don't have to get the same old beer since there's over three hundred on tap and in bottles in any given year. I'm a proud world tourist, and they make a great drink. The food is tasty, if basic. I'd love to see something a bit more daring a bit more in my face and challenging. I realize there's no sort of chef du cuisine, or any sort of that at each restaurant, but, if you're going to offer really good beer along side okay, mass produced beers, why not offer really good food to go along side pretty good food? That would create a tremendous niche for the Lizard (so long as they don't call it a gastropub, because WHO EVEN KNOWS WHAT THAT IS?!).  The burgers are good, and with the option to replace your meat patty with an Angus Beef (not a style of beef or anything -- it's simply a designation of beef that goes hand in hand with Choice, Prime, etc. Doesn't mean it's better than grass fed, just that it satisfied the Angus Beef board.) or Turkey patty is great. The wing sauces are tasty, though the higher you go on the \"heat\" chain, the more of a broad spectrum you get. I don't know that the Cajun is spicier than the Garlic, but, they're tasty. I really dig the chicken sandwiches, too. Get the one on Garlic Bread. I think it's the Chicken Parm. Oh, you will not be disappointed, friends.  My two gripes: I wish they offered a smaller fry. The gigantic steak fries are good when hot and fresh, but get soggy quick. If you're reading this, Lizard folks: You cannot go wrong with a crinkle cut fry. Don't worry about fresh cut. Crinkle cut.  Second gripe: Holy, holy loud Batman. The Lakewood and Independence joints get super loud thanks to a widely expansive bar with really tall ceilings. If there's game on, good luck having a discussion in the bar. Also, I wish the management team would police the aisles. Often times, two attractive girls decide to grab a beer, and invariably, hundreds of hambones circle their table making it impossible for people to get by. If there's twenty people in the bar, fine. If there's hundreds? Plow the roads, folks. Tell people to sit or beat it. While you're a full bar, Lizard, you're still a restaurant first.  All in all, you really can't go wrong with any of the Lizards. I'm partial to the one down the street from me, but, they're all very consistent, and you're getting food that'll taste the same at each. I'd cut and paste this reply to each of them throughout the area, but, I think that'd be frowned upon."}
{"text":"While the beer list at the Winking Lizard will have you drooling, skip the nachos and chicken wings.  We ended up there late-night for dinner.  I ordered the chicken nachos, a $2 updgrade for chicken.  If there was 1/2 a chicken breast on them, I'd be surprised.  The chips were food-service grade and the cheese was right out of a can.  They weren't bad, but I'd expected something a little higher-quality.  My husband ordered chicken wings.  They are not breaded which is fine as long as they get the skin crispy.  These had a big layer of fat and while the meat was done, the skin could have used another minute or two in the fryer.    We had visited the WL on a previous visit and ordered burgers and fries.  We were much happier with those meals.  The burgers were large and cooked to our linking.  The meat seemed to be high-quality.  The toppings were flavorful and generous.  We even splurged on the special fries with cheese and bacon.  Overall, we were happy with that visit.  It isn't a bad place to go, especially if you're looking to have a drink and watch the game.  I'd recommend ordering burgers, not appetizers.  Definitely more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I think I've been to all their locations & the newest one in Mayfield Heights doesn't disappoint.  The location is a bit odd-It's behind Eastgate Shopping Center, across from the theatre.  Food is pretty consistent & we've had good service here.  Recently had an organized lunch with a large group for a graduation & they did an excellent job.  Outdoor patio with several fire pits is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came to this location on a Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated by a polite host within minutes.  We then sat down to order and had some drinks. I ordered a margarita. The margarita was weak and mostly tasted like sugar. No salt on the rim, garnished with a lime. I essentially felt like this particular margarita was made by pouring half a shot of tequila into a pre-made margarita mix, which was disappointing.  The food was slightly better. I ordered the grilled salmon, which was clearly overcooked. Quite an accomplishment, actually, since salmon is a pretty forgiving fish. For sides, I had the steamed broccoli and macaroni and cheese. The broccoli was just fine, steamed well and not overcooked. The macaroni and cheese, however, was pretty bland. It had almost no flavor to it, and I felt pretty disappointed.  Overall, this location was just ok, and I don't think I'll come back. I wasn't soured by the experience, and the staff were lovely, but I didn't find the food to be enticing in the slightest."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! There is free popcorn for everyone! It happened to be wing and pizza night! Great deal on wings and awesome flavors! Carrots, celery and dipping sauce cost extra"}
{"text":"Sad I called to get wings for when we pulled up, kitchen was closed before what it says on the website. Guess we will go to one of the other chicken places in the area."}
{"text":"Went for Cavs watch party 5/21. Cocktails were terrible. Bartender(s) cannot follow simple instructions. Personally, I felt we were being served low shelf liquor at premium brand (requested) prices. Food was room temp when served. Had wings, potato skins, WL salad and the southwestern egg rolls. Nothing was 'super amazing'. Waitress Dee Dee was very attentive and super sweet."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers including American, German, and Belgium.   The prices aren't that bad either, they're affordable. It's your average bar scene but in a more casual sit down place with a sporty atmosphere. There are TVs everywhere with sport games on (i.e. Indians, Football, etc) and food is okay. I don't expect much from a tavern. I went here just to watch a game. It's like a Paninis and this place used to be over by the plaza next to Wendys. Good thing they moved here because it was much roomier and they have a great patio out in the front with XMAS lights.   First time here was on a Wednesday night and it was pretty much dead. Service is fast and I'd come again just to grab a beer or watch a game."}
{"text":"I am so sick of coming to this place without knowing who the bartender is. The most evil and hateful bartender on the planet works here and I can't stand it anymore. Her name is Heather and she is beyond what I would call unfriendly. She is completely unpleasant and very rude and sometimes degrading. I've had the displeasure of being served by her on numerous occasions. She is a fucking bitch and ruins this establishment. J even had to deal with her at Lizardville downstairs before. I'm beginning to think I'm cursed by coming here and always ending up with her as the bartender. Her coworkers hate her too and laugh it off when I ask for her schedule. I wanna come and enjoy my drinks and enjoy my food without having to deal with such a terrible employee being a rude bitch. I have complained to the managers in the past and they are all just as bad as she is. I think the Lakewood Winking Lizard has gone down the drain so hard over the past few years. The only ray of light was when they got rid of the horrible General Manager Michelle they used to have she made the whole place feel like a dungeon. But It's about time for Heather to go. She screws up my order every time cause she's so eager to get away from having to do any work and just stare at the tv. What a friggin idiot."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. It now officially sucks. Dont even bother honestly. Ive been here 3 times this month. Every burger comes out burnt (not just well done, im talking taste the crunchy char on it).  The waitress never even bothers to check in (literally drops food and wont see agin until the check is dropped off 30 mins later). Wings are dry and we got the wrong sauce 2 of the 3 visits (hot instead of mild, etc). Not sure what happened maybe change of ownership?"}
{"text":"Dependable neighbourhood sports bar. Above average food, great beer selection and lots of TVs. I've been upwards of ten times now (thanks to the Tour of Beers and NBA Playoffs) and it's a pretty consistent experience--you know what to expect and the quality of food/drink/service is the same each time. And to be honest, consistency and dependability is underrated these days."}
{"text":"Passing thru Macedonia Oh on a Thursday evening and yelped a bar. This place was about the only one close by. Very pleased. Great list of taps and bottles on hand too many to count. Over 100! Very eclectic and diverse menu with vegetarian and gluten free options. Gluten free beer too! But I eat meat and drink real beer. Lots of tvs with game on. Lil loud but to be expected at a sports bar. Friendly staff and quick service. Definitely will stop in again when passing through!"}
{"text":"great wings! and AMAZING beer selection.   very knowledgable bar staff when it comes to beer.  the rest of the food is slightly above the standard of average bar food.  fun atomsphere,"}
{"text":"I only come here because my girlfriend's softball team is sponsored by them. And you would think that they would have a table for us after the game, but no.  And once again the food is terrible, and the service sucks. I wished for once we would have the cool server that came from the old location, because she is nice, on top of our orders, and just a all around nice person. But yet once again, this did not happen. Even my staple, of sorta okay pizza has gone down hill. And now, sadly, we are all talking about going somewhere else. I would love if they could make a decent meal, but that is just too much to ask for. So once again, my suggestion is to go somewhere else if you want food before you go out for drinks...please winking lizard, read your comments on yelp, and make some attempt to make at least decent fod for us to eat. Cause I as well as the others on the softball team would appreciate more than just drinks to have here after the game. And btw, the best server here is Kim, hands down. Always, always, always, use her. She is the best server they have."}
{"text":"Went here after Lizardville which was next door. They had a great patio area in the back, plenty of space. Your typical bar scene with plenty of tables and beer. With a group of friends on a Friday night, it wasn't that packed. The place closed at 1 which was really weird since most places are open till 2AM so last call was at 12:30. They had shuffleboard, darts, pool, TVs and okay drinks. They were kind of watered down.   I wouldn't come back but I still give it 3 stars because the service wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, Hilton Garden Inn.  I ordered the chicken philly, which was decent.  We were surrounded by TVs, so it was good to be able to watch the Indian's game from any view while we ate our dinner.  Our waitress was polite, friendly, and informative and she kept checking on us, which was good."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap and bottled. If you can't find a brew you like you most likely should rethink your persepctive as an adult beverage drinker.  Food was pretty good for your typical bar fare.  Worth stopping in if in the area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Average food. The beer of the month glass is always a great souvenir!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Sunday night. Man, this is NOTHING going on in Cleveland. I know it was a Sunday but my God, I was waiting for Vampires to come out or something. Does anyway live in Cleveland?! Anyways, We went here by default becuase it was literally the only place open. The food was ok..your typical bar food: Burgers, Wraps, pizza etc. The wait staff was friendly and they had a decent amount of Flat Screens to watch the games. its more of a sports bar type atmosphere. The best thing about this place was their massive beer selection. They had over 100 beers in bottle and tap. If you are interested in trying different types of craft beer etc from around the US and the world this is the place to go. We had a great time and stayed until they closed (1130) woo-hoo. Being from Chicago the ghost town of Cleveland was a bit shocking. Again, I know it was Sunday but there was nothing going on Monday either...even after the game. Another great thing about this place was how cheap it was. There were 6 of us. We all ate and drank for 4 hours and our bill was $180..dirt cheap. Beer that would cost $8 in Chicago was $3.80.  So Bottom line, if you want to hang out and have a burger and some good beer and watch the game check this place out."}
{"text":"Great wings great pizza. You would not think that a wing place (the best wing place) would have AMAZING pizza... I mean why would you, right?  Well set those thoughts and fear aside. When you try one you will know that this is a pizza place and wonder why they have wings!! Wait, its because the wings are the best, why do they have Pizza.. You get the point! Both are amazing, really!"}
{"text":"Outstanding wings,  pizza..  really everything on the menu.  While no gourmet Winking lizard has great food."}
{"text":"Food was average , good . I had wings . Service at the bar was , well no service . I had to ask for a beer , I had to ask to order food ,  I was never asked how the food was or if I wanted another beer , Several men behind the bar , talking among themselves . I called after I left and spoke with the manager on duty ,Nate . I explained my observations and experiences tonight . Nate was very nice and apologetic . I feel bad for Nate , his front line troops failed him ."}
{"text":"Drinks are okay but I put 10$ worth of music into the machine and it was shut up. Do not go into this place playing hip hop and R&b or it will be disconnected. Besides that drinks are good."}
{"text":"Great place.  Good people. Fun times.  Close at midnight but that seems an Ohio thing.  Stay at Homewood Suites across the street."}
{"text":"I have always loved Winking Lizard and this visit was no exception. I came for dinner with a friend. She was craving a burger; and did they deliver. I could swear she melted right out of her chair.  My wings; ordered mild extra crispy with Ranch we cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Something to note. In many places if you order wings extra crispy you will often end up with a dry wing. Somehow 'The Lizard' keeps the meat tender and juicy on the inside while offering the perfect bite of rendered skin on the outside; WING PERFECTION!.  The service is always stellar as well and this visit was no different. The place was packed (As usual) and it took more than 15 minutes to get seated (We were the only ones waiting). This might lead you to believe that once you get seated it is all down hill from there but you would be wrong. I have found and I am sure it is no mistake that while you may see a couple open tables and wonder WHY AM I WAITING that once you do get a seat you have a constant stream, your water.. then someone takes a drink order, drinks show then someone takes your meal order and before you know it amazing food right in front of you.  If you love wings (Or anything else they make) and an atmosphere with good energy; lots of screens for sports fans then you need to visit Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place because it is close to home and  they have a wide variety of options on their menu, free popcorn, gluten free beer, and lots of tv's.  Ask for the house ranch....it is a million times better than the prepackaged plastic cups you will get with your wings otherwise.  My only complaint is that the \"waiting area\" is ridiculously small and tight with no seating....not good for older people or those with a physical impairment.  Avoid at peak hours on the weekend unless you want to sit in your car until your table is ready!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food was not really that great. We started with some hastily prepared \"nachos\". Nothing more than some stale tasting cold chips with non-melted cheese and way too many olives on top, only covered about a third of the chips as well. My 3 friends and I all got burgers, and not a single one of us ate more than a quarter of it. They were completely overcooked, rubbery, had no flavor to them, and I only asked for mine medium rare. The only reason I wouldn't give this a one star is because they treated us well and service was very cheery."}
{"text":"Great daily deals, check out the website since some of them are location specific! A solid restaurant, a Cleveland staple, a great place to get wings (I prefer mine extra crispy) and ribs (in the summer). They've got an incredible selection of beers, sometimes it's overwhelming how many beers they have both on draft and by the bottle/can. Of course they won't be winning any awards for outstanding culinary feats, but it's great bar food and great drinks in a casual atmosphere. If you're looking for somewhere to catch a  game on TV anf hang with friends this is a good place to do it. The patio is especially good for that."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hyatt Regency for a wedding and stopped here to try out their wings BEFORE the reception because my friend had recommended it.  Fun place. There was an Indians game that day, so the place was packed. I liked the atmosphere. We got three orders of wings to try out three different flavors.  Thai, the Garlic, and Cajun.   Descending order of quality. 3. Thai 2. Cajun 1. Garlic. Crispy wings, but the Thai and Cajun didn't quite do it for me. The only ones I enjoyed were the garlic ones. The sauce was on point.   Best wings ever? Nope, but worth a try for a quick fun meal? Yeah.   I cannot get over how cheap beer is in Ohio!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Lizard location, the expansion really helped. Nice layout, TVs everywhere, and good food. Don't forget the easiest parking is in the back of the building, not the front."}
{"text":"perhaps familiarity truly breeds contempt.  if so, i have spent waaaaaaaaaay too much time at the lizard.  maybe contempt is the wrong word.  i don't hate it, but if i never set foot in here again, i will not for a second regret it.  the good: multiple rooms, multiple bars, loads of tables and, saving the best for last, the beer of the month club.  for an extra $0.75 to $1.00, you get to keep the glass - which helped me to accumulate quite the collection for my own bar, which may someday exist.  the bad (neutral): just your average bar food - nothing bad, nothing good, nothing special.  it really is just meh.  depending on what you are looking for, the 400 televisions could be a plus or minus, but i'll throw it here in the middle.  the service is usually ok as well.  the ugly: i have to say, it's the crowd.  sorry.  this place is generally packed and LOUD.  i've always gotten the impression it's crowded more because it's one of the only places to go as opposed to being crowded because it's a great place that no one can resist.  oh, yeah.  the trapped iguana is not cool.  i'm sure they take good care of it, but i'm sure it would have a better life without the drunken masses tapping on the glass.  look, if you want to go get a beer, a bite of fried whatever, and catch a game, the lizard is a fine place to go.  i go back to plenty of 2-star places.  i'd just prefer to go elsewhere.  the main problem i always had with coventry, there just aren't that many \"elsewheres\" to go."}
{"text":"Went with wife and friends. Cool place  to drink brews and have some tasty food. Service was and the location is perfect. Many cool beers to choose from. Lots of TV's."}
{"text":"What's not to love. Best beer selection and great food! When I say best beer selection, I'm not saying a good beer selection. This places has one of, if not the best, beer selections I've seen in the midwest. They have rotating taps and featured brewery beers so it's changing often. They also offer 32oz specials of beers every day that can fit anyone's budget.  We come here randomly for boneless wings, as they have a great selection of sauces (similar to BW's), and on Tuesdays they have 50 cent wing night. They food is like good bar food. It's hamburgers, wings, and other food you would expect at a bar but it is good quality and they put a unique twist on some dishes.  Both my wife and I really like this place and we have had good service as well. We prefer sitting up at the bar but they have plenty of tables around that get good service. We had slower service during a baseball home game but that's pretty much expected at any place downtown. Other than that, it has all been good.  Recap: Great BEER, Great food, and good service. I know I had you at beer but you should really try out the food as well."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, solid food, and skee ball"}
{"text":"You can't miss the Lakewood location of the Winking Lizard as it is located in a large historic building that really stands out on the corner of Bunts and Detroit.  Lets be honest. I dont think anyone goes to the Lizard because of their amazing food! It is more about the atmosphere and experience. They have a beer list that is out of this world (and very hard to pick from if you are indecisive). There are over 100 types of beer!! They also have free popcorn while you are waiting which helps if the service is ever slow. The menu has something for everyone because it has just about everything you can think of on it. It is all very affordable and is a great bang for your buck. I love the summer menu the most with all the barbeque options. Eating BBQ on the patio is a great warm weather combination.  The only suggestion I have to steer clear from is the boneless wings. Basically just nuggets with some sauce splashed on them, much better options on the menu and I always feel like I need a bunch to even fill me up. They will also charge you extra for ranch which they ask you if you want."}
{"text":"My review is coming from a strictly drinking perspective. I came here on a whim while walking through Cleveland with the boyfriend. We were on our way to the rock and rock hall of fame, and came across this place. We wanted a few beers so we decided to check it out. The inside was decorated in a rock and roll/ sports theme. We arrived around 3 on a Sunday evening and there were only a few other people there.   Their draft list was pretty awesome... First of all, it was electronic. The screens informed you of the beers they have on tap, where the brewery is located, what alcohol percentage it is, what type of beer it is, how much a glass is as well as a sample and what type of glass the beer comes in. Pretty informative for a draft list. The electronic draft lists also displayed what people checked in on untapped... So when I checked in my beer on the app, my picture came up on the screen- pretty awesome!   The bartender was extremely helpful in helping me decide what I wanted to drink. I was looking for a triple IPA and he convinced me to try founder's devil dancer... It was awesome. My boyfriend was Ecstatic because they had southern tier's Phin and Matt's American ale. After that I had the Great Lakes spacewalker...  Another awesome beer. My boyfriend had southern tiers live. Overall, we had a great experience. Great service and great beers!"}
{"text":"What you expect from the chain... super busy on weekends... slow to bus on week day evenings... popcorn to kill the grumbles during the long wait."}
{"text":"The manager said they will only play Cleveland related sports ...it's the World Series!!! So if it's the super bowl are they not going to play the game because we all know the browns aren't going to the super bowl any time soon???? Very disappointed with the manager staff"}
{"text":"I needed a place to go grab a bite after a visit to Cleveland Clinic. My shuttle driver suggested Winking Lizard. I Thanked him profusely when he returned to pick us up. No drinkers in my crowd but the beer selection was phenomenal.  Started with mac n cheese wedges and ended with some great sandwiches.  Something for everyone 8 to 80. Service was just as great!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a drink whether it's happy hour or not! Prices were great and it seemed to be a very popular place. Had the usual bar food menu, which could use a little updating but a solid 3 star spot."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is Yelp's technical term for two stars. It's eerily accurate for my thoughts about the Winking Lizard.  Anything charming about it was probably lost years ago. I think there's more Winking Liz's in NE Ohio than there are Chipotles.  Even the rumored original one in Peninsula is really just a tourist trap anymore. The food is pretty average, they have 1,002 beers, 993 of them which you'll never try...I don't know...I like local stuff, but I've been to these joints about 3-4 times now, and I can't imagine going back. I cringe every time friends suggest meeting here before a Tribe game.  Kind of like the Sam's Club of bars. I suppose they're useful, but nothing has ever remotely stood out to identify them as being above-average.   There are simply too many other choices."}
{"text":"Reviewed is based only on beer, wings, and the service."}
{"text":"The Lizard is my family's go to restaurant/bar. They have a big selection of draft beers and over 50 bottled beers available on their tour list. The bar area has plenty of TVs and they have a great outdoor area. Perfect for game days.   The food is nothing fancy, but always delicious. You can't go wrong with their wings. They also have wing night on Tuesday. My go to menu item is the Buffalo chicken wrap. It has just the right amount of kick to it. There is also a seasonal menu they offer every month or so that has some excellent dishes on it. My favorite seasonal dishes are the Buffalo chicken dip (surprise) and the Thai peanut chicken salad.   Overall if you're looking to hang with family and friends, knock some beers back, watch a game or have some decent American bar food the Lizard is your place."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for two days, stopped here for a burger and a few beers. The food was good, inexpensive. Impressive beer list, however out of a bunch of drafts in the middle of the week. Bar service was terrible."}
{"text":"Well to start out I was on a business work related stay in the Cleveland area and decided to meet up with a few co-workers here on Tues Night which happens to be a wing special night so be it let's do Wings! I started out with some boneless wings in various sauces which were good an easily I could go here instead of Buffalo Wild Wings at times.  I won't lie I had a few of the bacon cheese fries and they were on point. The location inside was cool with an insane amount of tv's one end of the bar to the other which made watching a game a breeze. Service was dead on and they also have some sort of outdoor viewing after with what looked like a bar. This is a cool place and if I have visit the area for work I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar after a Brown's game. The bartender's were miserable. Someone should remind them they filled out their application to work there and bartend on Sundays."}
{"text":"Love the patio here-they built a stage since I was here last, will be nice for live music outside. Got an entree for the first time-was pleasantly surprised! Teriyaki chicken with rice pilaf-the rice was warm and the garlic bread it came with was yummy! Love their salads- everyone else got those, large portions with good toppings. Always frequent for a cold beer and warm food-will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Phone service is absolutely horrible. Learn how to train your employees for phone conversations. Hanging up after I ask a question and they think they answered it appropriately is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I didn't have any alcohol but I did order cherry coke and a grilled cheese with fries. They didn't put in any bacon or tomato as I requested.  The fries were fried in old oil. I could tell by the taste.  The plain grilled cheese was tasty but again, it was missing bacon and tomato as I would have asked."}
{"text":"This is a popular regional chain. OK food. OK beer. It's OK. There are many more pubs in Cleveland where you can find better food, better beer (more selection) and a more authentic experience. For example: Academy Tavern on Larchmere. For example: The Little Bar & Grill downtown. For example: Flannery's downtown.  Etc. If you want some wingz with the dudez, go here."}
{"text":"I have never had a BETTER Cobb Salad. Everything was fresh and perfectly chopped. Just in town for a few days on a sister road trip. Main objective was to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But we also managed to see a show at the House of Blues. There were so many choices of restaurants to pick from. But we were happy with our pick."}

{"text":"Recently, the Winking Lizard in Coventry had its menu changed. I am really sad to see the Dessert of the Month go, because it was always delicious. I was told it was removed because they couldn't keep the ingredients in stock before most of them went bad. Shame. Another think I really am disappointed in is the layout of the menu has changed. The Menu used to show the drafts and a description for each one. They used to be prominently displayed, but not they are in a corner with no description! How am I suppose to pick one if I don't know what it is going to taste like! It has made it much harder to make a decision now. I'm docking a star for that."}
{"text":"This is my go to place before Tribe Games.  They always have amazing beer specials.  Great atmosphere, never have bad services here.  Also their burgers and spinach and artichoke dip are very good."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 4/29/17, lunch was ok, ordered a fried chicken sandwhich with homemade fries, came out skinless, and grilled chicken with premade frozen out of the bag fries. Beer was good, angry orchard. Service was ok, not to good, she wasn't around too much for refills. not a really good experience"}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have NFL Sunday ticket and ALL NFL games available! The decor is old but the wait staff is nice, food is decent and accommodations on games are excellent! That's what has brought me back 3 times in 4 weeks!"}
{"text":"The music is the sports bar was great with a lot of base. We had the beer battered onion rings and nachos to start. The choice of draft beers seem endless. Lots of good choices. I had a $3. shot to start the evening followed with a 22oz beer. For the main corse we had the black bean burger and a veggie wrap. Our friend ate a pulled pork sandwich and loved it. A must try is the BBQ sauce on the table. We watched the ball game while it rained outside with the stadium across the street. This place had great service with a friendly, helpful, wait staff."}
{"text":"Great place to go to socialize or relax with friends. Food isn't spectacular but the patio area is nice, they have a great assortment of beer, and tv's everywhere."}
{"text":"Who knew that lizards could wink? I certainly didn't, that's for sure! But once that little lizard looked me straight in the eyes and winked....I knew it was possible. Warmed the cockles of my heart!  I have been to a few WL locations and this is probably my favorite. Nestled in an old Lakewood building, this place has tons of charm....and crappy parking. Welcome to Lakewood folks! Great buildings and parking that makes you want to take a long walk off a short pier.   What an absolutely fantastic patio this location has. The entire front of the building is covered with tables and chairs. Part of the seating is like an old time porch....one of the things I love Lakewood for. Lots of umbrellas so you do not bake like a rotisserie chicken!   Tons of inside seating as well and a massive bar area with tons of TV's. The noise level in here got kinda loud. Probably due to the high ceilings and tons of wood around you. Not a place for an intimate gathering by any means.  The wings here are very good! Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Got the chipotle pepper sauce and spicy sesame. SWEET BABY JESUS! Fantastic flavors lemme tell you. And on Monday and Tuesday you can get them for $.60 a piece. Not the best price around, but a good deal none the less.  Our serve was effective and friendly. Not as attentive as I would have liked, but let's not split hairs. Overall, I have a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DESTINY! My oldest turned 15 this year and where did she want to go to eat? Winking Lizard, that is where. Not just because they have a Lizard who winks....but because they just plain rock! Free popcorn, a huge Lizard and fantastic service are just a few of the things this place boasts.   My kids and I come regularly to WL for their wing special night. That's right yo...I love me some chicky wings on the cheap! Not to mention, my youngest can get pizza on those nights too.....everyone is happy! WIN WIN! We had never been to this location despite living not too far. Parking is plentiful (front an rear lots) and their patio looks to be beautiful! I cannot comment on how nice it is only because it is winter....and anyone who knows Ohio, can completely sympathize!  We ordered 30 of their traditional wings, lots of ranch and some celery. Here are a breakdowns of wing flavors:  1) Chipotle Chili: This sauce is by far my favorite. I wouldn't rate it high on the spice....and I love spice. I am a spicey guy myself! But, the flavor profile is fantastic. Garlic, onion, chipotle pepper and a little heat. Really, it is fantastic!  2) Teriyaki: Just your run of the mill sauce. Nothing special but very good. A little more on the sweet side than salty.  3) BBQ: We got the plain BBQ this time and I was VERY happy with it. Smoky, sweet and tangy. Really a good blend.   My youngest got a cheese pizza and as always, says it is some of the best. She loves the sauce and the crust. It is a winner for her.  One of the things I love about this location are the skee ball tables! I wish ALL their locations had these babies. Sweet mother of monkey milk man, this brought me back to the good ole days. I loved seeing my kiddos and parents playing a game I grew up with. iPad, eat out dust! Some things cannot be replicated on a screen.  The bathrooms were super clean and so was the rest of the restaurant. We will be back to this location post haste! For my birthday actually! Look for my check in ;)"}
{"text":"Everything here is completely good, no joke.. like real good.   My favorite item I always get I usually is the Bo Man's Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. LOVE IT, great fries and I always get extra pickle spears.   You can't go wrong with the wings too.. and they have lot's of beer on tap too, to try!  If you are in the Akron/Cleveland area it's a great local franchise to stop and visit."}
{"text":"Always a great spot! I am on the beer tour and usually come in here after class for a couple beers and bite to eat. The staff is always super friendly from the bartenders to the servers. The food is decent for the price and always fills me up. They also run food specials frequently, and have a great variety. I can usually find whatever I have a taste for, and under $8 dollars! The spot is nice and large and surprisingly always has a decent crowd. I recommend the winking lizard downtown location to anyone looking for a cheap but good meal. And of you are a beer lover, this is certainly a spot for you! Well done downtown location! You never disappoint me!"}
{"text":"Service a little slow but a nice waitress. Took long time to get first and second beer. Took long time to get a warm spinach and artichoke dip. Was good not very warm. Not planning a return visit"}
{"text":"We were in there on a wednesday night; brought at least 10 of my co workers in there.  We were there just to drink; i had the beer flight.  I loved the peanut butter cup porter from Willoughby Brewing.  We got in there at 910; and the bartender promptly shouted 'LAST CALL' at 9:20.  9:20.  PM.  Who closes their bar at 9:20?  You have 10 people (and they would have emptied kegs) and you kick them out to go to another bar?  at 9:20?  Why?  What the hell?  Enjoy your fate just like the rest of the Galleria."}
{"text":"It's one of our \"we don't want to cook and the kids need something fast\" places...servers are great, food is pretty good.  Have a live lizard to keep the kids occupied.  Only issue is that it's a little loud, even on the dining side.  Bar side is very loud...they turn the speakers wayyyy up.  Patio season makes this place more of a go-to place for us.  Great beer selection, seasonally they rotate a lot out.  Restrooms are clean but be prepared for a wait on busy nights."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard is a ubiquitous Cleveland institution - there are 14 locations (7 of which are within 20 miles of my house) and they stretch as far south as Columbus. I've been a frequent customer most of my adult life. I cringe a little when I think about how many nights I spent at that little front bar in the Coventry location, Guinness in hand, dreading the short winter walk back to my Coventry apartment. But when it comes to Winking Lizard's, this particular location has to be the gem of the franchise.   Plopped inside the renovated guts of an old Elk's Lodge building on Cleveland's West Side, it's just beautiful. Uber-elevated ceilings, dark woodwork, and a cavernous main room are all parts of what make this Winking Lizard the best. If I had to describe it in only a few words, not an easy feat for this guy, I'd say it's part Dave and Busters and part German beer hall.  There are two main reasons I frequent the Lizard, beer and beer. When it comes to beer selection it's hard to compete with Winking Lizard. They have one of the best draught lists in NE Ohio (dozens of taps and hundreds of bottles) and their World Tour of Beers is a Cleveland-area institution. If you're like me and you have to have a different beer every time you're out, you can't go wrong here. They also have a glass of the month beer where you get to keep the glass. Kudos to the guys behind their beer list. It's chock full of useful data like style, brewery location, ABV, and serving size. Cheers indeed.  The menu is also pretty expansive for a bar-type restaurant. Chances are if you like food they've got something for you. Burgers, ribs, salads, pizza, wraps, sandwiches...the list goes on and on. Did I mention that they've also got some of the best wings I've ever had? Crispy, hot with flavor out the ying yang. Try the spicy sesame. Just do it. I've never really had a bad meal here. The burgers are tasty and actually cooked to order, the wings, as I've already mentioned, are killer, and the grilled chicken sandwiches are always on point. Oh yeah, and their house BBQ sauce is fantastic on their fries.  I've got nothing but good things to say about the Winking Lizard. As a native I grew up on them so I'm probably a bit biased. Bias aside though, they are a solid joint with better than decent bar food and a beer-geek-sized brew list. On the down side (see, I can be objective) they can get a tad loud, especially during sports-type events. Not bad I suppose, just not my thing.  P.S. If anyone from WL reads this you've gotta add that German soft pretzel app you had during October to the permanent menu. IMHO anyplace with a beer list like yours needs a soft pretzel on the menu. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Came here after the Browns-Raiders game. They had people in there but not super busy. We had a new waitress and she was lost. We didn't get our drinks ordered for at least 20 minutes and then another 15 min. until they came. We ordered food after being there almost 40 min. We ordered appetizers and salads along with some burgers and sandwiches. After 30 minutes , they brought out one salad, even though we had ordered 4. really? after complaining they brought out our salads  but no appetizers. we were there almost 2 hours and still they forgot one main order. I think the kitchen is in shambles here and it all falls on the waitress staff. 'The manager did approach us and apologize along with giving us a discount on our bill. Probably wont be back ."}
{"text":"Slightly above average standard bar food. Maui Maui Chicken sandwich and beer came to $12.50 plus tip which is the upper limits of what I consider acceptable for this type of venue. Fries were quite good: thick, crispy and soft in the middle.  Sandwich was okay, but then again it would have been hard to screw up a grilled chicken sandwich with a slice of canned pinapple on top.  Service was SLOW. I'll cut a little slack since it was a big party and they were kind enough to split the checks. The waitress was polite.     I wouldn't mind coming back here to watch a game and drink beer (they do have a good selection of beers), but I will probably avoid eating my meals here with so many better options in the area."}
{"text":"I've concluded that this is the best Winking Lizard restaurant in the whole chain. There are two specific reasons why:  1) The $5.50 32oz Dortmunder on Mondays and Tuesdays. As far as I know, this is the ONLY Lizard location that offers this special. Most others offer Bud Light or some other disgusting swill for the 32oz special. This is the equivalent of two pints. And it's not just during Happy Hour, it's all night long. Pair this with the fact that Monday and Tuesday are also 40-cent wing nights, and you have one of the most epic nightly specials ever.   2) It actually feels like a neighborhood pub. This location is in what used to be three storefronts on Coventry Road. So many other Winking Lizards are way out in suburbia, and just have that total suburbia-feel to them. This is one of the few that actual feels like it belongs in a neighborhood.  I've been to a lot of different Lizard locations. They're mostly the same. But the small differences really do matter."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Winking Lizard location, but it's definitely the best you're going to get in Akron suburbia.  The menu consists of mostly fried bar food, but it's pretty good at that. I'm a big fan of the wing sauces (40-cents on Monday and Tuesday). There are also other worthwhile specials during the week.  The beer selection is quite good, and the reason to come here. This is a good choice for beer snobs. They have the World Tour of Beers, which is a fun gimmick. If I lived near a Winking Lizard, I'd definitely do it. The \"glass of the month\" is also a fun promotion, but be advised that they never keep enough glasses in stock to last for the whole month. You've pretty much got to go the first week of the month to ensure you can get a glass.  Otherwise, this location has a pretty nice space. It's a good place to come and hang out with friends for a little while. The patio is nice in the summer, but people are allowed to smoke out there, so depending on your luck, you might be choking down second hand smoke while you're trying to enjoy your beer."}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly convinced that the Winking Lizard has the best wings in the world, bar none.  Buffalo ain't got nuthin' on them...and I've had true Buffalo wings.  While they have a large assortment of wing flavors, my favorite is the caribbean spice.  I can easily put down a couple dozen or so!  And their beer list is HUGE, best, I've ever seen, anywhere!  I've never done it, but they have the 'beer club' that you can join.  If I still lived in Cleveland, or if I ever live there again, I will certainly be trying that out!  Cool, relaxed sports environment too, great for watching games.  They have other Lizards around Cleveland as well, in Coventry, Independence, Cleveland, and Avon I believe."}
{"text":"Winks is always a sure bet in my book (I prefer it over the original Winking Lizard). I love the reclaimed wood table tops and the vintage Cleveland concert posters (Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, and the like...).  Their turkey burgers are the bomb dot com paired with a customized Coke Freestyle creation.  Winks has a copious amount of indoor seating and large patio for Cleveland's warmer months."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to catch up on your sports teams but I'm not a sports guy myself. I come here for food and to catch up with friends. There are specials Sun-Thurs like wings, pizza, ribs, and burgers. I especially enjoy coming here on wing nights (Mon/Tues) and burger night (Thursday). Their wings are quite large and nicely done. You can choose from over 10 variety of flavors. My favorite is the goldfinger, which has a great combination of tanginess and sweetness. The burgers are also quite good. I like their wild western burger for it's simplicity and heartiness. It's just basically a big BBQ burger with bacon.  There's a huge menu of beer at your disposal and you can also do their world beer tour. The beer tour rewards you with prizes along the way and a party invitation to their end of the year party if you completed the tour (100+ different beers over the course of the year). I have yet to take on this challenge but my friends have done it and had fun doing so. A few years ago, the party was held at the Browns stadium. Anyhow, the food here is typical for a bar restaurant. What's neat here is that it's convenient for people in the CWRU/Cleveland Heights area to meet. There's plenty of seating but it does tend to get busy and loud during home games."}
{"text":"I visited about a week ago while meeting up with a friend to pre-game a bit. Fast, friendly bar staff and the wings were so good. And only .50 cents on wing night! I will definitely be returning soon. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"I live very close to this location so I often order take out or pop in for a meal with friends.  I always experience great service and the take out service is especially good.  They always make sure everything is correct with my order and it's very fast.  The food is awesome for bar food.  I love the boneless wings!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for carry out. They always get my order right. Friendly employees and clean!"}
{"text":"Rejected to seat my 18 year old friend because she wasn't 21. We were seated in the dining room (not near the bar) and were here for wing night. No one had alcohol"}
{"text":"I am actually shocked I have waited this long to review The Winking Lizard. After all, I basically live here. It's gotten to the point where they mind as well just set a bed up for under the bar.   Now, I can't speak on the food really because with the exception of the Lizard Freckles (yes that is an actual item on the menu), I've never actually eaten here. What I can talk about though is their beer selection, and let me tell you: it's quite the collection. They have everything from banana bread beer to German Hefeweizens, to ol' reliable: Guinness. They safe is also very nice, and depending on who you get, very knowledgable about their extensive drink menu.   Overall, I am head-over-heels for the Winking Lizard, and a little part of me likes to think he's winking at me."}
{"text":"Just wanted a quick drink before an audition. No bartender, waited 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Service was curt and no \"thank you.\" Didn't try the food, as we were just exploring downtown, our first time in Cleveland. Fine with not returning."}
{"text":"Correcting review of wrong location. Not from Cleveland, first time to the city. Assume this one is fine. Will update when I visit THIS location"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we found a long piece of Brillo in our chicken wings and the wings weren't clean big pieces of feathers still intact. Will not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service-they even have a giant green lizard (in a cage).  Directions on Yelp are not entirely accurate, but will get you there.  Definitely worth a repeat when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Wraps and burgers are great. Prices are a tad steep. Happy hour is always a big plus. Best place in town to watch a game or two. Huge beer selection. Service is consistently hit or miss. 20 minute wait for cold soup:fail."}
{"text":"Not bad to go to. I miss the CLE hts location though I think this one overall is nicer. In a better area. Beer selection is big to say the least. Great prices on pizza and wings Mondays and Tuesdays. Wing selection is very unique. I prefer winking to bdubs. Lots of tv's and a nice outdoor patio. Drink prices can be steep. Lots of parking. Hidden behind shopping center near Target. Walk to movie theater. Enjoyable time. Service is pretty good most of the time. Not always. Take cedar eastbound just past Som Center and turn left at the next light . Have fun!"}
{"text":"Good location, pretty old food. Love their pizza. 55 cent wings on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Service is usually great. Bar area is loud, dining area toned down. Get over it and you'll find this location pretty good. Clean amd tastefully decorated. All W L's serve popcorn."}
{"text":"Super great service, neat atmosphere with lively music playing.  Had extensive draft selection and wing selection.  Did a sampling of several different wings and they were all very good.  Would recommend here for something easy going like wings, beer, burgers.  It is a very happening place before and after games, from what I hear."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food has always been good. I have never had a bad experience with staff either.  The place isn't that big so if u come during peak hours expect a little wait."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, attentive and knowledgable bartender (Tunisia). Nice and laid back...not divey, but not uppity hipster either!"}
{"text":"My wife daughter, and myself are still talking about how much we enjoyed our Sunday lunch here.  This was somewhat shocking to all of us since my wife won't let any of us order alcohol and since I don't like noisy bars with lots of TVs.  We got here about 1:00 pm and it was about 90% full but it cleared out quickly after that.  Our server was very attentive which was surprising since we only ordered entrees, most of the time they forget about you at these places after they figure out that you aren't buying drinks and appetizers.  I had the BBQ chicken which was supposed to be $7.49 but which they charged me $8.99 for, it was worth it because they gave me 3 chicken breasts instead of a 1/2 chicken.  Wife and daughter had the Philly Chicken sandwiches and enjoyed them.  Loved the steak fries, they don't overload them with salt and spices like most places do.  The iguana 'Miss Pickles' even turned around for us."}
{"text":"I was not really a fan of the food or service here. My soup (tomato and cheddar) was great but my daughters burgers were burnt. Another complaint about the food are my sons pizza, It was a little undercooked. Our service could of been better, Our waiter never filled our glasses and wasn't that friendly."}
{"text":"I'm trying to be fair because I came here in the midst of a Browns game - so the place was packed. But the waitress had absolutely zero personality and it was obvious she didn't want to be there. The buffalo chicken wrap was decent but I was surprised to get pre packaged sauces. The price was decent. I didn't get silverware until I asked for it. Not a horrible place but it wasn't a memorable experience that makes me say, \"hey if you visit Cleveland be sure to eat there.\" I'm sure there are better places to eat. Sorry guys -"}
{"text":"Everything I dislike in a bar.  Really loud, televisions everywhere, obnoxious fratboy type clientele, mediocre food, and mediocre service.  Ill grant them this: they have the largest selection of light beers on tap that Ive ever seen.  Id prefer to drink at a bowling alley over this place any day."}
{"text":"WARNING!   They have NO air conditioning on the weekends. This location is attached to the Galleria Shopping Complex. On the weekends, Galleria SHUTS OFF THE AIR CONDITIONING. What very little supplemental system this restaurant has, is not adequate. The staff is awesome, but I'm going someplace else that's actually comfortable to sit in.   Pictures are of actual outside temp and inside temp. Currently the bar has 3 patrons and I count 12 total additional people at tables in this restaurant at 7:15 pm on a Sunday. I can't imagine a busy night! Very disappointing that the owners wouldn't take care of its employees, let alone its guests..."}
{"text":"So, not to be a hater but the food here just wasn't that good. Now, that's out of the way, everything else was awesome. Service was so friendly and warm, the beer selection is off the hook with a ridiculous amount of craft beer from all across the country and they have shuffleboard and skeeball.  The place is known for their wings which just weren't that good. The sauces all tasted the same, the freshness scale was at about 2 and the blue cheese/ranch came pre packaged in little cups on the side. If this is Cleveland's best wings, I think I have a million dollar idea brewing. I also had some of the pulled pork sammy which was decent. The cheese fries smothered in bacon bits were delicious but I mean really, how can one eff up cheese fries smothered in bacon bits? Exactly, you really can't.    Overall, this spot was a solid for a wide variety of craft beer, cheap drinks and sub par bar food.   *** A really nice patio space with heaters and a fire place for those cooler spring nights."}
{"text":"There was really not much to brag about coming here. It's really nothing too special. It's a glorified sports bar.  Our server was not very friendly or happy to be there which speaks volumes.  We ordered some garlic wings and mac and cheese wedges.  The wings were cooked alright, but it was buffalo sauce with a bunch of garlic powder added. Very weird taste and texture. The mac and cheese wedges were what you get at the frozen food section. They had no flavor whatsoever.  Waitress never came to check on us, just dropped a bill off and took our plates. Pretty depressing. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Love the Lizard!  FYI they moved to a new address. This is for the old location.  They are on the south side of Rockside up the hill  behind Bob Evans."}
{"text":"The location on 82 is great, but you'll almost certainly have to park in the rear of the building, and wark through a long, deserted-looking hallway.  I think this location is kind of a pale imitation of the one in Peninsula.  If you're looking for a decent bar, and a huge selection of beers, Winking Lizard is hard to beat, especially in this area.  If you're headed out for dinner, though, you might look around a bit more.  I don't have any complaints about the food, in general.  In fact, I had an excellent cajun catfish po-boy (from the Mardi Gras menu).  The problem here is the service.  Everything seems to just take FOREVER.  I watched my server, and she didn't seem to be moving at a glacial pace, so maybe she just had too many tables, or the kitchen was backed up?  I don't know what the deal was, but it's jut slow, and this wasn't the first time, either.  So, I guess if you're not concerned about time, go."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant/bar.  I'd liken it to Chilis or TGIFriday as far as being a family-friendly restaurant that serves alcohol and a variety of dishes to please any average palate.  We started with the Lizard Freckles (aka fried pickle chips).  You can't really screw up a deep fried pickle unless the breading doesn't stay put... so these were just fine.  I really enjoyed the cucumber wasabi dipping sauce, which was super fresh with a tiny punch of heat at the end.  My main was the Crab Cakes (they were on the Mardi Gras menu).  OK cakes, but I wouldn't get them again... and can't recommend them either.  The steamed broccoli side was large, warm, and fresh.  My friends got a burger (which was huge) and the daily ribs special (which looked good but my friend said was too fatty)."}
{"text":"Went here with the family after visiting the science museum. It's a short walk. Got our table in half the time promised. Food was okay."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and just did a search of restuarants in the area. I am so glad I found this place! I started with wings in Caribbean sauce, wonderful! My wife had the fried cheese wedges and she said they were very good with lots of cheese. Ok main course here, I ordered full rack of ribs with baked beans and cole slaw. Best ribs I have ever had in a restaurant, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of sauce. My wife's burger was also awesome."}
{"text":"If you want some good beer on tap, don't come here at the end of the month. The taps are dry that time of month."}
{"text":"Went here after the Browns game on Sunday 9/8.  Could have been the worst wings I've ever had.  They were dry and not very meaty.  Garlic sauce was OK I guess.  I told the guy next to me to not order them.  Burger and fries were decent.  Very sloppy burger.  We sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a seat.  The bartender was skittish, for lack of a better word.  Maybe he was recently victimized by a dine and dash, I don't know.  Or maybe just new.  At any rate, he made me feel uncomfortable.  Like he didn't trust us or something.  Just drank water since I was driving home.  Not sure if I would go here again.  Probably not."}
{"text":"This was my first visit on recommendations from Yelp. I ordered the brisket sandwich which came with fries. The brisket was so finely chopped it had no texture and almost no flavor. There was so much liquid the bread from the sandwich was saturated.  The fries were good and the beer was good. I was so looking forward to a good brisket sandwich and this was not it"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with okay food. Our server was very pleasant and personable. The reason for only 2 stars is because they watered down my bourbon!"}
{"text":"Love the food, been coming to the lizard for over 20 years.  Checked out the newer location, so disappointed with service.  We waited a long time before someone came to the table, our food came out at different times, forgot our sides..but food was great as usual."}
{"text":"you gotta love the Lizard! tons of craft beer, solid food selections, FREE POPCORN, tons of space, and a fun, casual atmosphere. nothing pretentious, just a place to drink and relax. and hey, a tank with a big ol' iguana in it too!  every month, a different craft/import beer is featured as the special. for just about two bucks more, you can take home the glass it comes in, from that beer's origin brewery. 6 bucks for a fill of good beer and a glass? FUC yes! it's like Pokemon - gotta catch 'em all!  prices for the craft beers are reasonable; a bit cheaper than what I'm used to here in New York, so I was certainly happy! they have a Beer Club where you can mark off that you've tried some ridiculous amount of beers there (I think it was 100?) and get a prize when you finish. a lot of good stuff on tap, so you can go for flights/samples, as well as a crazy bottle selection.  food is solid. tons of options, mostly bar/casual type of food (burgers, wraps, BBQ, pizza, and such). they've got a bunch of flavors for chicken wings (with obligatory thermometer), all of them are great. okay, so I haven't tried the two hottest ones...yet. or if you just want a little snack, there's a machine churning out free popcorn!  we took up a few tables on the huge outdoor patio for my cousin's wife's birthday party, then had to move inside when a sudden rainstorm attacked. staff was great and worked quickly to re-arrange the indoor area for us. I had no problem with the service.  now I need a beer!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and food. We've been to the downtown location of winking lizard and had better service than this. Our waitress Brittany took our drink orders in which I ordered a ginger ale and my sister and Mom ordered shots that was supposed to come shot glasses you could take home. But I'll get into that later. I still never received my ginger ale. We ordered our food and when we get it it's cold, bland, and unevenly heated.   We ordered some boneless wings and they were unevenly dressed in the sauce. My nachos were cold and the queso was terrible. My sister got a Mac and cheese that just looked like it was reheated. I understand that winking lizard is just supposed to be bar food. But I do think it should be at least decent. .  By this point the waitress is running around and I still haven't received my ginger ale. Halfway through my food my mom finally signaled her to come over and finally got it. By that point I was annoyed and disappointed. Our friend who ordered plain boneless wings was even disappointed. How can you fuck up something so simple. Our bill came up to $50+ dollars and we don't even think it was worth that. On our way out the door we're heading out and inquired to the manager about the shot glasses we were supposed to be able to take with us which it said on the menu. Apparently it's a different price for the glass and the shot which I don't believe to be true since it didn't mention anything about that on the menu. Overall, if you're look for cheap eats go somewhere better. I could've gotten hotter nacho cheese sauce at the theater than what I got here."}
{"text":"A little above avg. food for a BAR.  Nice BAR though. roomy. and has nice outdoor seating.  Had the wings.  they advertise the wings as LARGE. LOL how about Medium. Nothing special. Had the ribs. Not too bad, average. also had Oreo Oblivion. Nothing special here. 2 scoops of ice cream and 2 brownie squares with very little OREO.  So, take it or leave it. lol"}
{"text":"A great place for a beer--nice selection--and sit outdoors around the fire pit.  Super helpful and friendly staff.  Live music weekends adds to the fun"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is massive.  They have nearly as many  beers as the Lockview, although they have slightly fewer beers.  I don't know the numbers, I didn't count.  If you like beer, this is a place you MUST visit.  They have a World Tour of Beer.  Holla.  You can drink and be rewarded with both your name on the wall/merchandise AND liver failure.  Just what I've always wanted.  The Winking Lizard originated in Cleveland and is expanding into Columbus.  For whatever reason, it hasn't migrated to Akron like I would have hoped.  No, Peninsula and Macedonia don't count, since they're closer to Cleveland than Akron.  So, in that respect, they're a decently-sized chain.  They have wings, burgers, fries, and more wings.  Tuesday nights are 35-cent boneless wing nights.  Their boneless wings and their sauces are not as good as Wing Warehouse's, but they're still pretty damn good.  I love how they \"accidentally\" give me more boneless wings than I ask for.  Their burgers are not their specialty - the wings are - but they are more than adequate.  This place gets busy on most nights, so it is normally a good idea to come early and be patient while you're waiting for a spot at the bar or a table.  However, the servers are laid back and nice, as are the bartenders, so there's no need to worry about being treated like crap.  This isn't the Barley House.  This is the good ole Winking Lizard.  In terms of variety and quality, nobody can beat Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"ICONIC CLEVELAND IN THE HOUSE!  This is one of those wing places you will never forget. Some may even claim it's life changing. It's up to you to discover and walk on the winking side! Any of the wings are to die for and the beer selection can not be beat. If you are close by to any of the locations around the area I highly recommend you stop in for happy hour when an empty belly. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants can take you--This location will feed you. Don't expect much else."}
{"text":"I don't get it. This place was anything but a pleasant or friendly place. The bartenders were anything but nice in fact kind of snobby about different beers. When I asked for a Bud the guy very sarcastically said we don't have that kind of a gas station beer here...only bottles and microbrewery stuff.   When I ordered food it all looked like typical bar food (deep fried) so I thought I'd be on the safe side and order a quesadilla. Very bland tasting. Once again the way the bartender was acting you would've thought this place was fine dining.   Anything but!"}
{"text":"I'd like to visit again and see their game rooms.  Been there many times when I was in Lakewood...and I'd like to go again!"}
{"text":"This chain restaurant is very expensive. 3 beers, a shot and a PO boy was $29.  To me, that is quite pricey."}
{"text":"Not bad for a bar. The beer selection was decent, the staff was pleasant and the beer was cold. It is close to several hotels which makes it convenient. I did not eat anything so not sure on the food. There are better beer selections down the street."}
{"text":"Stars: 3  Pros: Extensive beer list. EXTENSIVE (selection is in the hundreds). Now, I dont drink beer, but I have to give credit where credit is due; I hear the beer is quite good. Location is convenient on Coventry. Service is your average pub service.  The Western Burger is pretty good. Fries are lousy (they are fat and not very crisp). However, you can substitute fries for a few different things, such as mac and cheese (it actually is served with SHELLs, not macaroni), which is pretty good.  For lunch, a meal + tip = $10. not bad at all.   They have multiple large screens for sports and such. It is firstly a bar...  Looking for a happy hour with wings, beer, social gathering place at night with a bunch of friends, etc? Try the Wink.  Cons: Fries. Unfortunately, they are not very good. I mention this because fast food fries (BK, e.g.) is better =O. The burger is also greasier than other burgers I've had in the area. Thats not a legit complaint, I admit, but its just fyi."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was great too! I tried a new beer and the server told me the story behind it which added fun to trying it. Very attentive service and the sausage sandwich was great!! Seems to be changing names soon and joining what is part of a existing chain. Hopefully the staff stay!!"}
{"text":"A cool sports bar and more.  A large space with an enormous bar.  The craft beer list is very impressive, which is always a huge draw for me.  And the beer selection is far more than your typical run-of-the-mill macro-breweries.  They even have mead, which I rarely see but enjoy.  The menu is bar food, but it is fantastic bar food, and the menu is huge.  I had wings, which as you know can vary quite a bit.  They were perfect.  This is a convenient spot right downtown near a number of hotels, which makes it a great spot for business travelers.  I would certainly come again."}
{"text":"Great bar to go watch a game, grab a drink and food.  While the upstairs is a Sports Bar it charms with a warm, classy & upscale feel to it.  There were TV's every where!  They had a good food choice and ton's of beers and other drinks to choose from.  The waiter was VERY attentive and caring.  Sad, they couldn't make a good Bloody Mary as their mixture was way too peppery and their homemade attempt lacked taste.  However, nothing was lost and I got something else.  Food & drinks were delivered quickly with consistent great service!  Prices were reasonable.  Downstairs contained a whiskey bar while there are rows & rows of every kind of beer you can imagine and purchase!  Great visit and will definitely plan to go back when visiting the area."}
{"text":"Freaking Amazing loving the Winking Lizard  great service great atmosphere awesome sports club do the Winking Lizard"}
{"text":"It hurts me to write this after the delicious soft pretzel they served me--piping hot. Oh.My.God. It was like the junk-food angels came down from the heavens and told me, \"You can die happy now.\"   Based on the quality of the other food we ordered, I'm sure said pretzels were just the out-of-the-frozen-box variety, but when served hot, brushed with melted butter and accompanied by my favorite fake-food condiment of all time (nacho cheese), I'm not complaining.   But that pretzel was really just a happy blip on the subpar radar of Winking Lizard Coventry. Now--I will cut the staff some slack here. I used to live near Coventry. I know the riff-raff they deal with on a daily basis. Lots of underage college kids trying to sneak in for drinks, drunk twenty-somethings testing their patience. I get it. But really, if you can't slap a smile on for your shift, especially when dealing with ADULT, dine-in customers? I've worked plenty of service jobs in my time. I've had to deal with the worst drunks (Browns game Sundays downtown... UGH x100) and I still wouldn't take out my shitty attitude on other customers. Here... try this. Instead of having a bouncer-like greeter at your door like you're a nightclub, how about you just stick with a smiling, pleasant hostess?   And not to keep the complain train going... but no one likes to eat in a refrigerator just because the staff is warm. I hate to say this, but the customers' comfort should be top priority. The room we were brought to was down-right frigid. The A/C was on in October. it was under 50 degrees outside. Problem numero uno. The server was asked to turn the A/C, which she did, especially after she noticed the entire room still had their winter coats on. Shortly afterwards another server told her to turn it back on because she was hot--AFTER hearing the request from a customer. Oy.   Lastly, like I mentioned before, the rest of our food was just not good. The wings looked soggy and under-cooked, yet dry--if that makes sense? It was like they were sitting for a while and getting cold before they brought them out. My grilled cheese was hardly warm, complete with congealed cheese inside--no melty goodness for you! And the loaded fries were just meh, but I think that's just my personal opinion. I don't like steak fries.    LIke many of the other Yelpers have mentioned, some consistency across all Winking Lizard locations would be nice. Oh, and staff that can at least pretend like they want to be there."}
{"text":"Looks like Winking Lizard got something right, and that \"something\" comes in the form of great beer lists and this particular location.   Yes, the Lizard has spots all over NEO, but like many other yelpers who have written before me, I agree that Lakewood takes the cake. It's nestled inside a huge, historic building with plenty of rooms for family dinner and/or bar debauchery--whatever floats your boat. Not to mention a game room, free popcorn and a bowling alley downstairs. You walk inside this place and seriously feel tiny, that's how tall the ceilings are.   I know what you're thinking... This chick probably just likes this place because of the free popcorn. Well, it's true. That does contribute to my feelings, considering my undying and intense passion for le p-corn. But that's not all. Take a glance at the insane beer menu and you'll see why.   The food? Well, it's not my favorite bar grub, but it'll do. I've had better veggie options at greasier spots. The burgers are tasty, as well as the wings, but I can't see myself going out of my way to eat here. It's one of those places you go to for the brews and end up eating to soak up the large amounts of booze sloshing in your stomach. (Nice image, eh?)   As far as watching sports--well, they've got a bajillion TVs and there's no way in hell someone is going to be tall enough to block your view. Not with those ceilings at least. So, sure.. go get your barley-pop sipping, wing-fingered macho time on. Lizard is a great spot to do it!"}
{"text":"Cleveland's answer to Looney's and B-Dubs.  It's got pretty standard bar fare, including wings (with a bunch of flavors) and subs and salads.  Plenty of TVs for all your sports viewing needs.  The service was alright.  It took a little while for my boneless wings to come.  About the aforementioned wings...I wasn't satisfied, overall.  Although you get a decent amount, and the sauce was good, they were HEAVILY breaded and I barely tasted chicken.  The bleu cheese was not good either."}
{"text":"A good time. Mega mega mondo brew and wing selection. Our server did great with our large group. S uprisingly tasty bucket o ribs. A great experience."}
{"text":"We went to two different winking lizard taverns during our stay in Cleveland and had a completely different experience at each. The same rib appetizer we had at one location came completely different at the second location.  I've always felt consistency is important when you have multiple locations. Overall the food was good but definitely points off for not being able to order consistently between restaurants."}
{"text":"Crappy food. Crappy service. Crappy atmosphere. Crappy neighborhood. Just... crappy. The only reason this place is open is because it doesn't have any competition and it's the only place to go."}
{"text":"Last night was wing night at the Winking Lizard. I have been to this Winking Lizard a few times and it's always pretty decent. If you can handle the Bro-Vibe of this place and get past the cacophonous 76 LCD screens blaring sports at max volume you can survive ok. There is a separate dining room which i much prefer to the Bro Sector.  Anyhow, I have been here for their burger nights and they are usually pretty ok. I really enjoy coming for the wings. My friend really digs the wings so he gives me a call when he usually goes up there. We showed up around 7 or so and had no trouble getting in and were served pretty prompt.   Going out for chicken wings is kind of an existential weirdness. It's so rooted in Bro-Culture that it can sometimes feel absurd to go out with the guys and smash chicken wings and beer without feeling like a total idiot and a primitive. Luckily the restaurant part and not the bar part helped me from feeling completely lame.  My girlfriend got a 12 Dogs of Christmas and I got one of those huge glasses of their specialty root beer. The Root Beer is AWESOME here. They have a wide variety of flavors - between the gang we had the BBQ, the Magma, regular Hot, Cajun, Spicy Garlic etc. ALL GREAT. All meaty and hearty...no gristley grossness you'd associate with normal wings. And for .40 cents a piece I'll gladly pay the higher price for the good wings. My girlfriend had the Blackbean Burger, which she enjoys thoroughly and will usually get one to go. The server we had was really on the ball, and did a great job.   Overall the food is really good, and the service is as well. I really like the wings here better than anywhere in Cleveland and everything else seems ok. I would give it five stars but too many morons go here and that room with the TV's is like a torture dimension."}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious food! The southwestern ranch was amazing and the bourbon barrel wing sauce is awesome! Unique flavors and a great atmosphere! This is definitely where me and my boyfriend will be before every Cav's game! Wish I could remember our servers name to give him credit! He was awesome!"}
{"text":"i lost my wallet here with 50$, my credit card, and drivers license in it. About 4 months later, i was notified that it was found and everything was intact. I have so much respect for this tavern it is insane"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch before a wedding. We are out of towners and were surprised there were not more people here. Our waiter Reggie was professional, courteous and kind. The food was very good and came out hot.  We would come here again."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland staple offering up higher quality bar food. Not a ton of healthy options but really good wings, burgers, and very extensive menu. Great beer list of both draft and bottles. The Lakewood location is our favorite, with a really cool bottle shop / whisky bar in the basement. Ever-changing specials and good happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and quick bite.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders quickly took our drink orders.  She was great the bar got supper busy and she was on top it.  She really needed some help but didn't let it show.  We order the cheese quesadilla which was okay.  The real deal are the drinks!! They have a huge selection of bottles and a decent draft list.  We will be back for happy hour for sure!!"}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard Tavern has a little of everything for everyone. This location is pretty huge, with several dining rooms and a patio. We walked in to sit at the bar and were promptly \"carded\" which was super flattering. While we sat at the bar there were several families with children sitting in the dining room, so this place is friendly for all. It was a weekday night but they had two bartenders on staff. We got our drinks promptly and the bartender was very friendly. It was also nice that they weren't too busy to provide quality service. Behind the bar are several large TVs showing a variety of programs (news, sports, prime time shows) but none of them had the subtitles on. We had pizza and boneless wings, which were both great. They have lots of different wing flavors to chose from & an extensive menu which typically includes a seasonal menu (in this case Lent and also St. Patrick's Day). They also offer a lot of craft beers on draft, but light domestic beers are only available in a bottle."}
{"text":"Don't remember much.... Dooooooortmunder..... Ugh,,,,,,,,,, (apps were delish but weird they took chili and baked potatoes off the menu...Huh??)"}
{"text":"I know its a chain but a local one created by two KSU Roommates and me being a KSU Alum I feel kindered! But crap the food is good!!!!! It all  goes back to that very simple principal of doing it right. You really don't have to be fancy because you'll start getting into the weeds and loose direction I believe, here they make fantastic burgers sides and I LOVE LOVE LOVE FF and theirs are awesome!!!!  Something else? their Aioli SICKENING GOOD!!!!   Put it on my burger and fries and I had to pass around ff with it on it was just that tastey!!!!! You really can't go wrong at any Lizard with any menu choice because? They keep it simple and delish!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's just okay. Service was great, but it's the same wings and no tator tots! Great new building but they could step it up on their wings. Test some new flavors and add tator tots full time. Guinness is on tap so that's a plus. Slaw was great. We will go back."}
{"text":"Boneless wings with the Spicy Asian sauce - yum!  It's consistent with other Winking Lizard's in the area, and is a great spot to hit up before or after a sporting event.  Also, if you're looking for a place to do Happy Hour in downtown - it tends to be a little bit quieter than Panini's, The Clevelander, and City Tap.  Probably just due to it's size - it's HUGE in there!  It just keeps going, and going, and going ...   The front area is available to rent out for Parties/Private events.  Its a great private spot!"}
{"text":"I came across this place because it was one of the few places open after a winter storm hit the city. There was a moderate crowd there due to a volleyball tournament at the convention center. I had high hopes for this place and it looked promising. There were a bunch of tvs all over the place and would be really cool to watch sports. They have some cool food and drink specials Monday through Thursday. I decided to go with the salmon over the ribs. The salmon was ok, nothing to right home about. One thing that I look for with service, which was lacking her, is drink refills.  My lemonade was never refilled here. I also had to get up and find my server and ask for the check after waiting about 15 minutes with no service. And even then no refill was given. I think that this place is worth another visit to see if my first visit was a fluke or is that a common theme there."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. What a pathetic excuse for a restaurant. I've been there twice and each time was a disaster. Both times I arrived in town late and there was nothing else open that was within walking distance of the Westin. I think I would have been better off going to bed hungry. Now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm going to wake up in the middle of the night with food poisoning.  Tonight I sat at the bar and ordered a lamb burger, medium rare. It came out cold and raw. I asked the bartender to send it back and he stared at me for a second and the look on his face was; really, the kitchen closes in five minutes and you want us to make you a new one? The second burger came out exactly the same way; raw. Sent that one back and asked for an order of chicken nachos instead. Worst nachos I've ever had covered in fountain cheese rather than real cheese.   Bartender was more worried about washing glasses and stocking the cooler than taking care of his customers. The entire place was filthy in spite of the fact that everywhere I looked the wait staff seemed as if the customers were a distraction taking them away from their busywork filling salt and pepper shakers and wiping the crust off the ketchup bottles. I could go on and on but I'm tired and I want to go to bed. Stay away."}
{"text":"Service was very poor. We sat at the bar and it was hard to get anyone to serve us. The backseat was broken so it was very cold in the bar area. Food was good, but the fried lizard freckles were over cooked"}
{"text":"The food is very good. There is a great variety to choose from as well as good choices for kids. It's a very friendly atmosphere but unfortunately they're usually pretty busy so expect a 10-20 minute wait. The mixed drinks are reasonably priced and well as the appetizers. You can also checkin before you get there to cut down the wait time."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. The loaded fries with extra beer cheese wasn't very great either. I seems like my friend and I waited a very long time to get our food, and no one was in there. it was a random Saturday night and I don't think everyone is aware that they're open right now.  A plus has to be the beer selection, of course. The wide variety of Whiskey was very appealing to me. The location is cool; it's always nice to see space utilized inside of the Galleria."}
{"text":"Kept passing this place by every time i was in Cleveland and always wondered about it due to the cute name. Finally decided to drop by and try it tonight.  First of all, i loved the theme and the ambiance. I had fun reading their lizard themed menu. Its cute. But i was also blown away by the service and food i had tonight.   I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese bites and also their wings. Additionally I also had the blue cheese burger - it was so tasty. It was an all around win for me. Will be back for more next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"nooooooooooooo thaaaaaankssssssss.  if you want beer and that's all, you can come here on a certain night and do the thing that's similar to 10-cent wings.  but then the food is disgusting... velveeta on your fries and such...   why am i even writing this.  as michael kors said on project runway, \"the worst review is no review.\""}
{"text":"A bar stool at the Lizard is pretty much my default position when it comes to any evening where there are more than 3 sporting events needing to be watched simultaneously. Been hitting the Lizard up for years, and I has a much cozier feel than some of the larger sports bar chains. Great selection of beer, and if you want a great selection of spirits, walk right across the lot to Lizardville and find one of those hard to find bottles for which you crave, whether its George T. Stagg, Booker's 25 and many others, along with some great craft beers.  The eats at the Lizard are always a solid bet. I go for beer and sports, but my friends always order something and leave happy and with a doggie bag.   For sports with good local folks who don't get too rowdy and love rooting for the home team, the Bedford location is the place to be."}
{"text":"So, I have found in general that I'm not a fan of the Winking Lizard \"brand\" but I am always generally pleasantly surprised by my visits.  The food is great and service is generally very good.  During a loud evening during this visit due to an Indians game, my girlfriend and I were shuffled around a bit from podium to podium while waiting for a table, but the wait was shorter than expected and this visit was exceptionally good.  Our server Tonya delivered friendly and efficient service and the food was as tasty as usual (we split a delicious black bean burger with fries and a side of veggies) but after leaving I realized that I had left my bag with a fairly spendy tablet inside.  I made a call to the Winking Lizard and was informed that they had my bag and it would be made available for me upon my arrival.  I went back an hour or so later to retrieve my bag, and everything inside was present and accounted for.  Although I might try to time my next visit differently, I will be back.  I can't speak highly enough of the black bean burger and the excellent service (especially given the Lizard's ability to snag my bag and hang onto my bag and my valuables.)"}
{"text":"One of the better local chain restaurants, and better than Panini's, IMO.  Good food selection - have never been disappointed.  Good beers on tap, and the world tour is a must for beer snobs.  Friendly service and family-friendly, as well.  I've eaten at the downtown, Miles Road and Coventry locations, and they're all consistently good."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is looking to upgrade the brand a little bit with this spin-off restaurant.  What worked: the food was good, overall.  Also, our server was frequently at our table, and the food/drinks came out pretty quickly.  The decor is also nice, inside and out.  What didn't: you're basically going to get the Winking Lizard experience for about 20% on your bill.  Honestly, I'd rather go to the Lizard if I had to choose.  I will make one caveat...I love bourbon, and they have an extensive list.  However, since it was a Sunday night, I did not try any.  This might bring me back for another visit."}
{"text":"I actually go here alot.  The food is decent.  The cobb salad is VERY good.  The beer cheese dip is like crack.  Some items are pricey, some are on point.  Overall, it's just an upscale version of the Winking Lizard.  My only real complaint is that the beer list doesn't rotate very often.  Nice selection, but it gets boring if you've been there enough times."}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel a few doors down so I decided to come here for a bite to eat and a few drinks! The moment I walked in bartender Bobby had greeted me right away and was very attentive which I loved! Recommended the wings which I ordered! No complaints what so all! Everything is reasonable pricing seemed a little bit shocking on how reasonable it was! Considering the location but hey I won't complaint! Overall great experience here and the bartender bobby was great! He definitely made his way thru all customers to make sure they were greeted and was taken care of! Outside perspective that's greaT! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"After coming home to Cleveland from my first 10 months in California, the first place that I want to go to hang out with my friends is the Winking Lizard in Lakewood. Before moving to California, I started a weekly Wing Night tradition with my friends from high school (we are now all college graduates)- I highly recommend Monday/Tuesday Wing Nights at the Wink!   When I'm hungry, I'll get 10 wings and celery/blue cheese. My favorite flavors are Caribbean and Spicy BBQ. When I'm in the mood to switch it up, my next favorite is Thai. But in all honesty, you can't go wrong with ANY of the flavors. At Wing Night prices, you can't get a better deal.  Besides Wings, I love the atmosphere at this place. The Bar area is huge, full of energy and friendly local Cleveland faces. Beer selection is always fantastic and I try my hardest to purchase the Glass of the Month. The free popcorn at the front of the restaurant is also a must. If you love BBQ sauce, you should also purchase a bottle to go.   The Wink is a Cleveland favorite and hence I can't help but readily give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, but the service was good, so giving it a solid 3-stars. The food was just okay (got the asian wrap, based on the server's suggestion)."}
{"text":"Packer fans be ware!! Terrible service and food. We had wings not fit for dogs, frozen beer cheese bread, and cut off after a round of Miller lItes!"}
{"text":"Very unaccommodating. Let us reserve a room for 18 at 7:30pm as we are here from out of state for a conference. We all drove there and then were told we could not come in to eat because some of our group was under 21. I have never heard of anything like this. Ridiculous rules and unnecessarily unaccommodating especially since we would have had a room, not sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Have been here several times without writing a review, so I thought I'd write one.  This place is GREAT.  The beer list is just remarkable.  A must for any beer connoisseurs.  I've tended to enjoy this place more when I've gone for liquid than for food.  Don't get me wrong, their food is fine.  They make a damn fine pizza, and depending on the night, you can get pretty decent food for a great price.  But their beer list has always been what keeps me coming in.  Lots of different types, always changing.  I have yet to tackle the world tour of beers but I will one of these years.  Having moved to the East Side, I miss having this place right near my house.  P.S. given that I LOVE skiball, I think it's fun that they have that available!  A great place to go for drinks for sure, and I don't mind eating there either.  On this particular visit I was there with family in from out of town, and we got excellent service.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Went to Winking lizard to watch some sports and get a drink but all the monitors were on the gun control march."}
{"text":"Nice place. They used to be known for having some of the better wings in Cleveland. They are now subpar. Dry and chewy. Staff is usually very good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a zoo quality lizard enclosure in the lobby. Lots of wood but didn't feel dark like some pubs with this style. Open and welcoming feel to it.  Food and service were great. Iced tea is on the strong side. I had the Turkey melt with fries which were crisp and tasty.  I'll go back next time I'm I'm the area."}
{"text":"Shoot me in the head. This corporate regiment of an establishment has run its course. Jack talk Thai? This is the third hottest sauce on your menu? It was sweetened red wine vinegar and a little heat. Will never eat here again. The only thing this place has going for it is the building it is in. I used to come here when it was the Elks Club back in the day and bowl in the basement when my older brother and his friends would drink here."}
{"text":"Hey its a good place to pop in and grab a bite and a drink to get out of the cold. Enormous beer selection and secondly a large food menu. I stopped in at 3lm on a Wednesday with no game airing but this would be a good place to catch the game. TV spread is best feature of the joint. I tried the \"drink of the month.\" Spare yourself! So gross. I like the wide range of wing sauces. I had boneless Cajun (medium spicey) and my boy had 911 (made my eyes tear and I only sniffed them). I'd be back for a game or a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was thrilled about the bowling alley but hear that it is closing soon.  We had a family gathering here and it was well catered and the bar staff was great to us."}
{"text":"This is a smallish local bar, but it has skeeball and a great crowd atmosphere.  The drinks are very reasonable and they have a great menu of specialty drinks."}
{"text":"When i came here with my coworkers, most were above the well aged 40's women and the greeters have said \"Hi Ladies\" and I already had a look on my face saying \"HEY ladies\" thinking i was one of them because of my hair. haha! the wings did not impress me much on the cooked side. it was still a bit red but the wings are huge and cheap. Will try again if i ever come back."}
{"text":"I really really enjoy dining at Winking Lizard. I have been to this location many times, and the Mentor location more than I can count. Originally what interested me was that they have such a great beer selection. I love to try new brews so I became a regular quite quickly. Then I did the world tour of beers. I was probably here 2 times per week.  The food is pretty good here too! I really like their boneless wings (thai, spicy bbq, and a few other flavors) and their burgers are really good! The wraps and fries are yummy, and the pizzas taste just fine! They also have specials. I really enjoyed the buffalito (i am not sure if that is how you spell it though) and the lamb burger.  Prices are good. Beer selection is great. Food is delicious.  I guess I really just like winking lizard because its all around good and almost anyone can find something they like here.  There is one draw back and that is the family atmosphere. Although, I do believe they limit it to 21+ only at a certain time. I understand its not just a bar, but a restaurant with a lot of beers. .. but I dont like seeing children anywhere when I just want to sit and relax with friends/beer."}
{"text":"How can a sports bar not have Bud or Bud Light on tap. Come on man. I'll be back when the king of beers is back"}
{"text":"Stopped in after looking at options near our hotel. Wound up here for lunch. Place was fairly busy but we were seated right away. Quite an extensive list of bottle and draught beers. Our waitress was quick to take our orders and bring us our food. Our group enjoyed the Carolina pulled pork sandwich; Bourbon brisket sandwich (had a great smoked flavor) and the fish sandwich. Also ordered fried Mac n cheese wedges. With drinks- apps and main meal, bill was around $40- very reasonable. Paper placemats had the beer menu as well as a variety of food and drink specials that occur throughout the week/month. Good spot and would come here again on return trips to CLE"}
{"text":"Seriously can't complain. A cleveland mainstay and easy go to sports bar. Wing and pizza nights are Monday and Tuesday. A million bottle/craft beer for the beer snobs out there. They offer the World Tour of Beers and you get a jacket. I think when you add up all the beers on that tour it's close to like $750. Wear that jacket w pride.   My only serious complaint is they have this anti Budweiser on draft thing. They have beer specials of draft for different nights (32oz Labatts Saturday to Monday....32oz Yuengling Tuesday to Friday). Just wouldn't mind having a regular Bud Light while watching a Cavs game. Bonus points for the patio out front. Decent prices and very clean place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"While the crowds have died for baseball and basketball downtown, its always a great place to stop for a beer before Cavs or Tribe game.  This is a must stop for Indians opening day.  They have a huge variety of food.  When you start calling something by one name...I'd say the \"lizard\" has become a staple in Cleveland bars and places to eat.  While I've never done a world tour of beers, they now let you go to any Lizard and continue the tour.  Used to be that you had to drink at the Lizard you started your tour at.  For those who dont know...The Winking Lizard World Tour of beers is you have one year to drink every beer on the list.  Its a long list of beers and when you complete the list.....you get a limited edition Lizard jacket with the year you completed the tour.  They have beer specials and a different beer of the month in a cool glass you can purchase.  While I've never sampled crack.....I'm pretty sure their BBQ sauce has traces of crack in it.  They also also have monthly limited edition new menu items so they always change it up.  Very good place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 6 times, and it seems like it gets worse every time. I came in on a Tuesday at around 12pm for lunch with my dad. We decided to sit at the bar and order since there was nobody else seated at the bar. The bar tender immediately walked up and asked how old I was. I told her that I'm only 20, but I won't be ordering any alcohol, just water. She said that I'm not allowed to sit at the bar even to order food, and even though I'm with my dad, unless I'm 21. She then pointed to a sign on the wall that states \"kids parked at the bar will be towed\". This sign is ambiguous at best, so I'm not sure what she was expecting me to conclude from it. Even if this is just a very poorly displayed restaurant policy, she was very rude and extremely dismissive. Naturally, after we moved she went back to watching tv. The food here is pretty good, the burgers aren't the best but their wings are reputable, and the fried mac and cheese bites are bomb. Oh, and don't try to come get dinner here unless you're over 21, because you can't get in after 5pm without an ID."}
{"text":"Every time I'm home, I make at least one stop into the Winking Lizard. It's my parent's favorite place for an inexpensive, easy dinner. Wing night features 35 cent wings, which is a really good draw. They have such good sauces...my faves being Caribbean, spicy garlic and sesame ginger.   I've never had a meal I didn't enjoy at the Winking Lizard and have been going there for at least 12 years."}
{"text":"I love there wings, I eat here whenever I am home.    I love the 911, Spicy Garlic, and Hot. I have tried the pizza, also good. I love the free popcorn they offer, nice little snack until you get your food. One of the best deserts I have ever had is the Funnel cake sticks. Has sports bar option or fine dining, can get very busy after work or during sporting events.    Love this place, great service, great atmosphere, and great food."}
{"text":"My fav wing place in Cleveland....Awesome variety of flavors, great specials, they really put effort into their operation. Been to several locations and this one is just as great as any ive been too....Love the wings here."}
{"text":"We had a huge group of 16, and Mary serves us amazing, beer and food was quick.... So great all around.... Definitely recommend for large groups! Wings were awesome, bison burger amazing, beer selection off the hook!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and really enjoyed it! Everything we had was delicious. Highly recommend anything with their bacon vinaigrette. Even a side salad was great. Burgers were cooked to perfection and since it was Thursday only $6.99."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, but the beer selection is great. Service has always been good when I've been there, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you're a fan of different beers."}
{"text":"The Lizard is tucked back in between a few hotel chains. We stopped by after a late night at work for a drink and bar food. Outside they have a fire pit that everyone was vying for space around. They have an outside and inside bar and the who place is set up sort of like a lanai. It was freezing that night so we went inside but, it was still freezing inside due to the doors being open.   They have a number of craft beers on draught and a sizable cocktail menu. Our drinks were great, the bartender was awesome, very good service. We ordered a few apps and split them....cheese dip, skinny wings. The food was subpar even for late night bar food, nothing thrilling. I would probably come here again for a drink but, skip the food."}
{"text":"We look forward to our weekly meetings with Troy! Great beer selection, good menu, and a wonderful server that takes good care of his teachers every Friday!"}
{"text":"Damn great wings!  How do you go wrong here on any level?  These are some of the best wings I've had.  I left Cleveland and moved out West 20 years ago.  Every time I'm back visiting family this is a must do along with Tommy's, Geraci's anything Little Italy ie. Presti's, Mama Santa.  They have so many beers on tap good thing I say walking distance.  Great mojo, great people, great food and drink there is no way to go wrong.  Be sure to sample a few different sauces with your wings!  Trust me there are no better wings anywhere!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Bloody Mary and a steak. Although I began to think I should have gotten the garlic wings instead. I ordered a medium rare steak, but instead got medium :-/ The steak was a bit too dry. The Bloody Mary was not bad, but could have been better. The service was great. Staff was friend and our waiter took good care of us. Would definitely come back to try some of their wings."}
{"text":"It's easy to praise a restaurant for their efforts when everything goes perfectly, but when something goes wrong, that is when you really see how a staff handles a possibly troublesome situation. Recently I visited the winking lizard tavern, and despite my medium burger being over cooked, the manager and waitress on duty handled the situation perfectly. They were pleasant, apologetic, and made what could have been a negative experience into a positive review. I wish more places had the training and professionalism shown by the staff on duty. Congratulations winking lizard. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and somebody suggested we eat here and I'm so glad they did!!! Great appetizers, huge beer selection and probably the best burger I've had in a really long time. Plus, our server was AWESOME! We'll definitely come back here again next time we're in Cleveland. To be honest, I wish we had one where I live. We'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun place to eat on Coventry to take in a sporting event or grab a beer this is the place for you. Basic menu with seasonal specials that are occasionally quite good. St Patricks day is special. Amazing beer selection. Although this is one of a local chain, it truly captures the flavor of the neighborhood. Expect families with kids, students, and professionals in training.   Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Big, spacious place with kind of a big chain vibe. Friendly service but the food was nothing special. My group got the nachos as an appetizer and they were fine, just good drinking food. I had the steak for dinner and it wasn't great - bland and rubbery. The house steak sauce was actually pretty good so that helped.  Decent prices, I think 16oz light beers were like $4 so that's a good deal. Not a bad place for drinks & apps while watching sports but wouldn't be my choice to eat dinner at again."}
{"text":"I had the Hanson burger. It could have been tastier but the main thing about it was the bun. I don't know if it was the type of bun they use or that it was kind of stale. I've seen and eaten many buns but I've never seen this type. My french fries were delicious and hot. The server was great but because of the burger I can't give this plate a higher score."}
{"text":"Happy Hour!  World tour of beers is going to be the draw in this place.  Mediocre wings and pub food.  But for beer drinkers draw will always be the beer selection.  Servers are very attentive.  I'd recommend a guys night stop for at least two before moving on."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Beachwood area I eat at this place and am never disappointed.  I ordered the skinny dippers, boneless chicken pieces without all the batter.  Although this does not sound that exciting, they were spectacular.  This was the first time I ordered these (usually have the wings which are also great) and I was very surprised how tasty they were.  The Winking Lizard has a great beer selection that I tried out with some comp. popcorn while we waited for our meal.  Service is usually pretty good, this time it was the server who actually suggested the skinny dippers.  Great Job!"}
{"text":"I love Winking Lizard.  We go there every week.  Monday and Tuesday they have 1/2 price small pizzas and $0.40 wings or $0.35 for boneless wings.  The food is quite yummy!  Their wings and wing sauces are excellent.  They also have a great selection of beers, both bottled and drafts.  It is a great neighborhood sport bar, casual and friendly.  There are people that have been working there for a while and are amazing!  Oh, and they have free popcorn!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a work trip to watch some Sunday night football and loved it. Fabulous selection of beers, both bottled and draft. They even had my hometown favorite, Victory Golden Monkey. Great hole-in-the-wall vibe and lots of tv's to watch games."}
{"text":"Great place to find a craft beer at a reasonable price. Awesome beer selection, great wings, and amazing soup (the soup changes daily, but I have never had a bad one yet). Sherry and Becky are great and will definitely take care of you."}
{"text":"Wow some how this place managed to screw up wings, they were super greasy and tasted rancid.  Like that had been fried   several times I told the server they are super greasyshe said well they are fried. I was about to say yeah I know Einstein I make them at home. I left the Einstein part out. She took them away all pissed of. My girl did seem to have food poisoning that evening. Done with particular location"}
{"text":"So I was here the other day with my parents and nephews. My nephews were being he'll ions, my parents were being thier challenging selves. The server was so patient, She was amazing. She modified the order on the fly, accommodated my parents, got the complicated order correct.  The Greek salad was amazing, the wings were hot and  crispy, fried pickles were perfect, and my mom did not complain. It would appear my winking Lizard curse has  been vanquished."}
{"text":"My go to when I have a craving for near by bar food.  I always get their pulled pork sandwich as a wrap with Mac n cheese... delicious!"}
{"text":"If you go to Winking Lizard, you go for the wings... and beer.  These are the two things that separate the Wing-King Lizard from any other sports bar.  Monday and Tuesday are their \"wing nights\" where you can order them at .35 a piece in increments of 5.  You do have to pay extra for dipping sauces. It is generally understood that you can't take home leftovers on wing nights, but many servers have obliged at our request.  Wing nights are usually packed, and if you have a big party, expect a long wait. On the plus side, you get to eat free popcorn while waiting.  Service ranges from OK to great. The worst experience was when a glass of ice water was spilled on one of my friends. A free side or something would've righted the ship but I guess you can't expect much more than an apology.  Great beer selection and drink specials. I usually get the beer of the month which comes in a customized glass that you get to keep.  Impressive range of wing flavors, with my personal favorite being spicy sesame. Hottest is the \"Magma\" which definitely lives up to its reputation."}
{"text":"The winking lizard is a strong go to for my wife and I when I the mood for American sports bar food. The beer selection is top notch, I love the bbq sauce and sandwiches. Ribs are good and burgers are good as well. A solid place to go to."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service is always so slow. Three out of the last four times I've been here it has taken about ten minutes to just be able to place a drink order and that's while sitting at the bar. It's not completely the bartenders fault I guess. They have a huge bar and seem to only ever have one person working the bar as well as having to make all of the drinks for the tables. It always seems to be fairly full at the bar and the restaurant usually has a fair amount of occupied tables so it seems like they should have more staff.   The wings are okay, but the ribs are really good. The ranch is made from scratch if you order a salad, but for some reason it's packaged when you order it with your wings. It tastes completely different than the salad dressing and isn't very good. The good news is this place is cheap, cheap, cheap. Liquor drinks for around $6 or less and most meals seem to be around $7 or $8."}
{"text":"Sitting at a table and just got in an argument about a banner covering windows blocking TVS during game 1 of world series.  To be fair, we moved the banner without asking and they replaced it higher to block more tvs. Customer service is officially dead."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before and also dined in. Typically service is quick and reliable. Feels like a typical family friendly sports bar, kinda similar to Applebees. Menu is diverse and affordable. Over 300 beer choices."}
{"text":"Go here for beer and  wings, not anything else.   They have a great beer selection, lots on tap and a huge selection of bottles. The menu does a decent job of describing them, but the servers really know their stuff. Ask for a recommendation, a description, and they know the answer, or they find someone who does.   Trying to eat a little healthy while drinking said beer, I got the spinach salad with blackened chicken. It was okay. Didn't really fill me up because I had to ask for it without about half the ingredients to make it healthy.   My boyfriend got the wings and loved them as was demonstrated by the sauce stained lips he sported around after eating them.  Another time I had the nachos, of course they were good because there's not much bad to say about chips with cheese.   It is really fun to watch games here, good atmosphere with friendly servers and friendly patrons."}
{"text":"Took a while to get seated.  Then took a while to get our beers.  The food was very tasty we had sandwiches and wings after a ball game.  The wing sauce was good, but the meat tasted like premade frozen chicken.    I didn't think the bar was that busy but I noticed t took a long time for other tables to order and get service.  That should be addressed.  They have a ridiculous amount of beers to choose from and you better brush up on your beer knowledge to order a beer.  I told the waitress what kind of beer I like and she gave me a suggestion that was no way near the same type of beer I like, but that is my fault for not knowing beer well enough."}
{"text":"We randomly chose Winks on our way to the science museum.  We were quite happy with our choice.  The food was good, the waiter was friendly and informative and very attentive."}
{"text":"Came in at 11:30 after a NIN concert at the Wolstein.  We sat down as did several other people coming from the concert.  It was last call for food our waitress informed us so we were really rushed in giving our order.   We ended up with the Mac n cheese bites app & Black Forest sandwich to split.  They have a large selection of beer however we were so rushed we didn't get to thoroughly look it over & thus just ordered something that quickly jumped out at us.  My husband was regretful of his choice after he had more time to look it over b/c there were so many other good options.  The food came out fast.  It was typical bar food but the fries were really bad.  In general it's not somewhere we would purposely choose to go but sufficed as an option in our situation.  It's not a dive bar but it's not nice at all which makes it surprising that it has so many beer options.  Only awesome thing was that a fellow concert goer pumped the jute box full of NIN songs to keep it going after such an awesome show."}
{"text":"Loved it.  I wish there was a place just like this next to Nationals Park. (Sadly there is not much surrounding Nationals Park)  Great sports bar with a yummy yummy menu.  We came here after the Indians game on a Monday night and got 45 cent boneless wings!  They have them in a lot of different flavors.  I got the spicy BBQ and they were very good.  We also got the nachos and they were ok.  I wish the nacho cheese had a little more zing to it.  Great beer selection too.  I had one of the Great Lakes beers.  They also have Yuengling and any place that has Yuengling is ok in my book."}
{"text":"It's the Wink! It's consistent with all the other locations. Went to this location before an Indians game. It was very busy but our table of 5 was seated in about 15-20 minutes.  They have a good selection of pub food such as burgers, wraps, fries, pizzas and plenty of alcohol.  As crazy as it was pre-game, service was still good and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, which also lists the ABVs. Food is okay, not culinary excellence, just decent bar food. Service is okay. Huge iguana sits on a log in a glass enclosure as you enter."}
{"text":"rude over the phone placing an order. Food was also cold by the time i got there."}
{"text":"In town for a week and stopped in here to watch the Cavs game. Food was good, beer was cold and our server was very attentive!"}
{"text":"I feel that the price is a bit on the high side for what you get.  You can get better deals on wings pretty much anywhere else (except Buffalo Wild Wings).  They have a wide variety of wraps, salads, sandwiches, burgers and other pub fare.  They beef up their menu by combining standard recipes with their sauces, but I never really crave any particular dish from the Winking Lizard.  The quality was and has always been consistently good, but not outstanding.  Sometimes they'll burn a burger or your wings will come out cold.  The place is always clean, the staff is always solid, and they can usually sit you right away.  One thing I love about the downtown location (and most every other Winking Lizard) is that the floorplan is different from any other restaurant (and from every other Lizard as well). Unlike most other buildings that are usually 4-sided, the downtown location floorplan is in the shape of a triangle. I enjoy how the restaurant has several different dining spaces throughout that give it a smaller feel.  The beer selection is outstanding, but the drink prices are also on the high side."}
{"text":"Visiting From Virginia and my family recommended the winking lizard for a family dinner. Good beer selection, and service. My wife and I ordered the margaritas, and they tasted like lemon Gatorade -- Not recommended.  Food was ok at best. I'm sure there are better places for food in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Food gets 3.5 stars, but overall atmosphere and enjoyment bumps it up to a 4. The beer selection is probably the best in town. A number of things on tap that are constantly rotating and a huge bottle list. Chances are that if you're looking for a certain brew, they'll have it. Fun place, always different promotions - they gave out giant mugs one month when you ordered the Oktoberfest beer of the month, they participate in a beer run every year, some locations do a clam bake, they have a 100 beers club (try 100 different in a year and get a jacket and invite to a great party)  The wing sauces are great, definitely what makes the wings stand out compared to other places in town. I do prefer my wings a little crispier on the outside, but they are always juicy and cooked to perfection on the inside. The white bread pizza is also addicting. Everything else on the menu is fairly standard bar food and sandwiches, nothing special but good versions of the classics. They also do a rotating specials menu based on the season (Oktoberfest, mardi gras, etc) that are fun to try.  Service is a little hit or miss. My last visit, I had a really great, friendly server who offered beer suggestions based on our taste and was happy to sign my friend up for the 100 beers club despite it being a busy Cavs game night. But I've also had the complete opposite end of the spectrum when the wait staff has been unhelpful, inattentive, and even rude.  Overall, a fun place for happy hour, game watching, wing night."}
{"text":"Had dinner for wing night on 8/2. Service was decent, sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather on the patio. My only complaint was once again ( has happened a few times) we ordered an appetizer and of course not a few minutes after the appetizer came did our dinner. Probably one of my biggest pet peeves."}
{"text":"It is a good thing the food is good because the service has been awful.  Our waitress didn't want to be here and then she disappeared.  We had to chase down other people to help us with our dinner.  They are lucky the food was worth staying for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a Saturday afternoon in the area, and we stopped here because it was close and nearly empty. That should have been a red flag since it was the weekend the convention was coming to town but we went anyway.  We were seated quickly and then began our three hour ordeal of long waits. It didn't bother us too much. We were fine talking and in no hurry. But refills would have been nice more than once an hour. The food was mediocre. The drinks were actually pretty good and cheap, so that was the highlight of the visit. I wouldn't have bothered with a review if the following hadn't happened when I left -   We were waiting outside for an Uber when a homeless man approached me. He was very friendly and didn't ask for money but for food. If I'm able to help someone who is hungry, I will so I asked him what he wanted. He said wings would be nice so I told him I could buy him some from the place I had just left. He said he didn't think he was allowed inside and I said he should be if he's a paying customer but just to make sure I went in to order them for him to go.  I found our waitress from earlier up front since the place was dead and she didn't seem to actually service tables that she may have had. I told her I wanted twenty wings to go for the man with me and was asking him what flavor he wanted and what dressing when suddenly a manager appeared.  Somehow my boyfriend and I had just spent three hours in this place with a waitress who was nonexistent for 95% of the time, and there was no manager in sight to make sure service was being provided. Apparently this place doesn't pride itself on service but it seems to definitely have a handle on treating other humans like trash.  The manager who didn't make an appearance for our three hours of waiting was suddenly available and immediately told me he wasn't having any of this in the restaurant. I didn't understand and told him I was just ordering something to go for the man with me. He said no, he doesn't want any of this going on in the restaurant and we needed to leave. I asked him what was going on and he said anytime people like this come in and there is money involved there is usually more going on. I have no idea what that meant. Maybe I was buying or selling drugs?  I then told the manager that my boyfriend and I had just spent plenty of money and time there and that now I was buying this man some wings. I told him that was all that was going on and that I needed to pay and go because my Uber was waiting.  He finally accepted the idea that maybe I just wanted to buy some wings for a hungry guy and started to ring up my order. It came to 17 something so I gave him a $20 and told him to keep the change to which he replied \"I don't want anything to do with this.\" What?? What could he possibly think was happening? I walked out and seconds later the homeless man was right behind me - they told him they would bring his order out to him and that he couldn't wait inside. I left and cried the whole way back to our hotel because of how they treated that man. My boyfriend called the restaurant to make sure the man got his food. They said he did but who knows.   I sincerely hope that place goes out of business. For one it isn't a good restaurant. It was some of the worst service I've ever had, but that never upsets me to the point of hoping a place fails. I want them to close because of how they treated people that day. My boyfriend and I were free to spend all the money and time we wanted there that day and no one seemed to care. But minutes later I walk in with a homeless black man and the manager/cop on duty suddenly cares what is happening in his restaurant. I don't know if he had a problem because the man was black or because he was homeless. He wasn't wearing a sign that said he was homeless, so I guess I can only speculate about why the manager had a problem with the man having food from there. All I know is that in that afternoon I was suddenly brought back to a time when some people weren't allowed to eat in places everyone else could eat, and it broke my heart.   Do not give this place your money. Or if you must, bring a black homeless man with you to order some take out just to see firsthand how that restaurant doesn't want to allow it."}
{"text":"I went to the Winking Lizard with my ultimate Frisbee team after day 1 of a tournament. The food is excellent!  There's a wide range of choices on the menu--burgers, wings, pizza, salads, etc.  We had a party of 14. We had no trouble with noise like others reviewers have mentioned. The service was fast, and our waitress was AWESOME."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something besides my normal haunts for lunch. I looked at the Winking Lizard website and saw that the dessert of the month for January was Cinnamon Roll Streusel Cheesecake. Yum! This is the closest WL and is a 22 mile round trip, but the dessert got me in my car to head on up. First thing, popcorn machine was off, no fun. I ordered the turkey club wrap and added that I wanted no pickle. Then I asked about the cheesecake. The waitress looked a little confused then said they don't have it anymore. The wrap was ok, not as good as I've had there before, but what got me was when I got to the end of the meal, I discovered there HAD been a pickle on the plate, but it had been removed. That left the french fries on that side of the plate dripping in pickle juice. That's just tacky to do that to someone. At least wipe off the plate. So I made a special trip to Macedonia in 10 degree snowy weather, spent more than $3 on gas to get there, got pickle juice I didn't want, and got no cheesecake that was the whole purpose for the trip. Oh well, some days you have to take it up the hoo hoo I guess!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food and love the changing specials that are seasonally done.  Great atmosphere and patio to boot!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at a winking lizard. We went for dinner, and there was not wait. They had a really nice patio, with an outside bar, but due to the weather, we were forced inside.  The decor inside was slightly hectic, with lots of tvs.  Our waitress was nice, but we felt rushed through our meal.  I got a burger. It was large and came with fries. It was more well done than medium, but it still was an average burger. They had a large tap selection, with lots of local beers. This was a nice place to try, but I think next time we would shoot to enjoy the outside bar area!"}
{"text":"As far as bar food goes, Winking Lizard has one of the better menus. There is a great variety and the quality of the food is better than you'd expect for a sports bar at a reasonable price. My favorite is the white pizza--I think it's better than some of the pizza joints around. The beer list is extensive--enjoy trying new drinks every time you go! And if you are an avid beer drinker, you should sign up for the world tour of beers so you can win lizard swag and go to the tour party at the end of the year. Be forewarned, the service can be a little slow at times and tables a little packed, especially on game days. Monday and Tuesday are wing nights, a pretty good deal for pretty good wings (but no doggy bags). Overall, a pretty solid choice for a pre-game dinner, small group dinner, or just catching up for drinks."}
{"text":"Meh....  I'll start with saying this. Our server was great!! She kept apologizing beause of how long we had to wait for our food. I truly do hate it when servers do that. It isn't her fault.   The food was mediocre, it was greasy bar food. Definitely wasn't something I'll look forward to in the future.   It was noisy. I was trying to carry a conversation with my business partner and couldn't.  Again, the service was great and she kept her eye on our drinks. But, we ordered our food and waited over 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches.  I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"food was good. selection of beers was amazing.....waitress very knowledgeable and helped me pick one that suited me well."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different winking lizard restaurants (Bedford, Coventry, Beachwood) and the service has always been pretty  good. However, tonight at the winking lizard on Huron, the service was excellent, thanks to Adam (who I believe is a manager).   I came with some friends prior to a concert and we each had a couple of drinks. We then ordered food. The food took quite a while to come out (much longer than normal). Because it was a very busy night with the CAVS in the finals, we didn't complain. However, Adam noticed this issue right away and majorly took care of it. He bought our table a round of drinks and apologized for the extra long wait. We all really appreciated this gesture and it was such a professional and kind move. Thanks for checking up on our table and making it a great night! Shoutout to our server Ember as well who was constantly on top of the issue!   We will definitely all be back!! GO CAVS"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer from what I remember.  Decent wings and a great atmosphere.  My  Friend who lives in the area loves it , I prefer a more laid back atmosphere of say The Harry Buffalo. But still good for a downtown spot."}
{"text":"This might be my fave sports bar and (local) chain of all time. This was my first visit to the Mayfield Heights location, which essentially replaced the now extinct Coventry/Cleveland Heights Lizard. As opposed to the former, this venue features an outdoor patio for summer fun. A global array of brews, award-winning ribs and wings, and an eclectic seasonal menu anchor the Lizard experience. It is no wonder so many locations have proliferated across northeast Ohio. As with all locations one can pay respects to a larger-than-life iguana and enjoy complimentary popcorn.  Loyal and hardy adventurers can also enlist in an annual World Tour of Beers challenge to win prizes including an exclusive Tour jacket and end-of-year party."}
{"text":"It looked cool from the outside.  Once inside it was a bit of a chopped up layout.  WE did enjoy some free popcorn while we waited.  The beer menu is pretty extensive.  You can drink around the world with all beers listed with thier ratings.  The little macaroni and cheese bites were unbelieveable!!!   But the service was slow, and the waitress seemed unconcerned.  She was almost aloof to her job.  We were pretty disapointed.  The bathroom did not help the cause."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and it was flavorful and well cooked. The fries weren't my favorite but they were edible for sure. The bartenders were attentive and they had a great beer selection and mlb package so I was able to watch the Cubs game while traveling for work."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times and each time been less and less impressed. I keep telling myself \"once more chance,\" but that falls short every time. I do not get the hype over this restaurant that has less than mediocre food. While they have a variety of drink options, it is essentially comparable to a Chilli's or Applebee's (and I would pick either of the two over this place)."}
{"text":"My first visit to one of these chains.  This is not bad.  Many beers, and a beer club (2010 drink club member #something checking in).    I had the pizza personal size sausage and mushroom.  Above average.  The staff was very friendly.  One complaint.  Why do only pints count toward the beer club?  If I want to drink 100 beers one tall boy at a time, that's my business.  Come on all we are both doing is moving product here.  Ah the wings are also good."}
{"text":"Went twice because selection is very limited in downtown. First visit was all around lackluster and some of food was inedible. The second visit, the food was decent, but the server seemed annoys to be at work."}
{"text":"Always walked by here and saw a good crowd so figured it was worth checking out before an Indians game. Meh been to better sports bars and there are a ton of better options nearby. It's a decent place to watch the game, they've got a good beer list, and their M-Th specials are pretty solid (50 cent wings, rib specials, etc.) but service is mediocre and the food was unappetizing at best. Wings are decent, but not spicy, even if you order the hot kinds, and the rest of the food was bland, unappealing, and tasted like a low-rent Applebees. I want to love this and be a regular to do their World Beer Tour, but it's just not up to par."}
{"text":"Ok now let me preface this by saying I'm a Winking Lizard lover and have always been a fan. I much prefer the Lizard over Panini's any time, but this downtown location just isn't up to my Lizard standards.   First off the way they do their table wait list has room for improvement. They \"light up\" your number on various walls around the restaurant. Whatever happened to those buzzers they give you (like at the Cheesecake Factory)? Eh. I stared at the number signs like a hawk for fear of being skipped and not getting our table.   The food was just ok. We got spicy garlic wings, one of my personal go-to faves which is usually just a big kick in your mouth with some garlicky goodness. Sadly, I did not get spicy garlic and instead just got a somewhat-spicy garlic (though really, there was no burn). And they were mushy-ish. Major disappointment.   I'll have to rely on other Lizard establishments to satisfy my spicy garlic wing cravings."}
{"text":"Winks is in a convenient location in Beachwood near the highway and east side neighborhoods. Excellent and friendly service. I have not experienced a wait for a table. Nice sports bar atmosphere but more upscale than a Winking Lizard. They have a great selection of beer and whiskey even though I usually just have pop or water. I've been here several times and have had great food every time. I've had a salad, crab cakes, pulled pork sandwich, and more. Highly recommend whether you are just in town for business or a regular."}
{"text":"I really liked it. Period. Good beer. Good service. Food was good for what it is. If you want friendly, quick service and to quench your thirst...I recommend it."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD . I am a huge Lizard fan, I have to say this is the only location I ever experienced this with. After waiting over 45 min for our server, then another 45 min for our food we complained to the manager who did absolutely nothing. Shame on the Lizard, I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"The name reflects exactly what you were thinking the food you would expect.    All American, 50 burger, pulled pork, chicken, seafood sandwiches.... with 3 salads on the menu.  I had a delicious oriental chicken sald, done just right, my boss had the brisket lunch special - minus the bread...  The COOLEST thing (and I posted the pic!) was this OLD SCHOOL popcorn machine that keeps popping popcorn and you just head there, and  there's a big stack of plates and you refill it... Show me that ANYWHERE in NY, Chicago or Miami... LOL...   So with the 20 full size TV screens surrounding the huge walls, it's a perfect munchie while you shmooze environment.  It was a 3 minute walk from the hotel, and althought it was chilly, it was pleasant.  Yes, if I stay there again - I'm visiting..."}
{"text":"This is a good spot! Friendly staff and patrons. Yesterday when pregaming the baseball game the bar next door set on fire so all patrons were rushed out. Showed back up after the baseball game and the bar comp'd the tab due to being rushed out. Wings taste great too, will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day.   My wife ordered a small plate of chicken wings (5)    She got the pigeon wings. What a disappointment. Approx. Cost was $5.   Went to Harry Buffalo and got more wings and they were twice the size."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Cleveland and our first time at a Winking Lizard. The atmosphere was great and our server was wonderful. They were still out of most beers due to the RNC but the beers we had were tasty! My partner got the steak dinner and was impressed. I got boneless wings and nachos and, frankly, neither were good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch before the Cleveland Monsters game. We were seated quickly and the food came out quickly too. The waitress that we had was very helpful. Great place for bar food - especially before the game!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Food excellent, service excellent, beer list phenomenal!!  Definitely a repeat, especially for a game."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself isn't quite the same as the Peninsula location, but the food and beer are just as good."}
{"text":"I frequent this location at least once a week because I work nearby.  In the past I have ordered the chili, soup of the day, quesadillas and burger.  When I tell you they have NEVER gotten my order right I am being 100% honest.  A few weeks ago,I ordered soup and instead I found chili in my bag.  When I asked, they said \"we ran out\".  So they weren't going to tell me?  They just assumed I'd be ok with it?  The manager said he would take it off my bill, instead he charged me twice for it.  I called to have it removed and I was told I would get a call from the district manager.  I have yet to receive that call or a refund.  Do not patronize this business."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is one of my favorite places to go for lunch/dinner. I really enjoy the burgers and the place (though smaller then their old location) is still a good place to hang out. I wish it was closer to where i live so I could go there more often."}
{"text":"The best part is, It's next door to Lizardville.  A good place to watch the game and scarf some above average pub fare.  I mean pretzel buns, hello.  The beer selection is pretty good too.  But, the best part about this Winking Lizard, is it's right next door to Lizardville (My only 5 star to date)."}
{"text":"really nice TV set up.  good beers.  my 'hot' wings were more like medium and not very fresh (not timed up with other dishes a table that took longer.  the garlic wings were pretty awesome.    but something going on with the salt content in their wings, because i was thirsty for 2 days after eating there."}
{"text":"Solid bar & grill.  Great beer list and reasonable prices.  I went with classic bar food- skins & wings.  They were done right.  My only criticism is that the wings are a bit smaller than the \"JUMBO\" that are advertised on the menu.  Not BWW small, but not huge either.  I would go back, no question."}
{"text":"Yes, this is just a Winking Lizard, and yes, it is just basically bar food. It used to be a Lizardville and we used to come at least once a week to grab some beers to go or for a meal. I was bummed when they up and moved all the goodies to Lakewood because the RR location is within walking distance to our house. But Winky Liz still has a large beer selection, free popcorn, and Pfred's Preferred Pfries which I love ordering for the ridiculous name. And ridiculous amounts of what is definitely not real cheese. Their pizzas are blah, but recently they've had some specials that somewhat impressed me - a lamb burger, ravioli caprese salad and veggie-stuffed pita. Ok, so they almost certainly don't make their raviolis in-house, or have the vegetables picked straight from some garden behind the AMC theater (ewe), but I don't hold them to that standard. The ravioli caprese salad was doused with a tad too much balsamic, but other than that was well executed. My pita was filled with lots of crisp, crunchy veggies as well as avocado, and just the right amount of ranch-type sauce. The pita itself was sturdy enough to not break open the second I bit into it, and yet it wasn't stale and cardboard-y. So no, this food is not revolutionary or farm-to-table by any means, but for standard bar food I'd much rather eat here than some of the chains and even local equivalents.   This is not true for all the WL's I've been to, but this location has always had great service, both now and when it was Lizardville. One warning: this restaurant is considered \"Winking Lizard Light,\" so they don't carry the full menu of stuff that the other WL's have - for instance, no mac-n-cheese bites. Although, as our waiter informed us, they'd be happy to make us some nachos with their mac-n-cheese on top. Also, no actual lizard resides here."}
{"text":"Glad a lizard opened up so close to home. Monday & Tuesday Wing and Pizza nights are really popular with the family. Consistent quality and fast service."}
{"text":"Ideal spot to take the kids for dinner. Very family oriented - servers are accommodating and the other patrons all seem to understand when someone's kid has a meltdown. It's not going to win any prizes for culinary achievement, but the food is good for what it is and the solid draft list helps me get through dinner with two little kids."}
{"text":"Decent spot, nothing really special. it has an extensive beer and liquor menu. hung out in their tented area, which is kinda nice. it's warm and has lots of TVs so you can watch a bunch of sports. but the bartender has to run inside to get your drink orders which slows down the service a little.   overall it's a nice place to watch a ball game, but there's better spots around the area to go."}
{"text":"I would give it more stars but the Catering is meh. Stick with the coming here for a game and some wings. Catering is at your own risk."}
{"text":"Overall, decent pub food. My tomato/mozzarella salad would have been better had the dressing been on the side.  That peanut butter porter though...that's some tasty beer. I tried to order in other places, no go. Would return to Winking Lizard just for that. SO yummy."}
{"text":"This is your local neighborhood casual dining sports bar. The theme of the restaurant is pretty neat (lizards) and they have an actual green iguana in a large display.   We dined here on a Thursday night and it was packed. There was a 35 minute wait for a table of 6. What I really liked about this place is that they have a popcorn machine with free popcorn for while you are waiting. I thought that was a great idea.   We were able to find 6 seats at the bar (crazy, I know) and we ended up ordering dinner there. The bartender, Aaron, was a very friendly, clean cut guy, who made suggestions and was very pleasant. I felt the service was a 5!  What I like about this place is that they also have specials every day. On Thursday the 1/2 pound burgers with a side are $6.99.   The food was okay... Nothing out of the ordinary. I had the Chicken Sandwich and the bun was soggy on the bottom but the chicken was cooked well. I asked my family what they thought and they said the burgers were good. I would say the food is a 3.   The bathrooms and menus were super clean. I always consider that a plus!"}
{"text":"It's bar food, but I know locals go crazy for this place.  The wings are good, but very salty and very greasy.  My husband was most impressed with the extensive beer selection and the wide range of choices on tap. I wouldn't eat here again though..it wasn't worth the indigestion afterwards."}
{"text":"Great wings. Spicy sesame are amazing. Great place to watch the Ohio State game!  Lots of TVs, great service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"So I'm a little toasted as I write this review - so feel free to ignore my rants or my raves.   The good - the beer selection is pretty darned good. And the bartender knows his beer selection. I started with the 471 IPA, and he moved me to the Fathead IPA, which was an excellent selections. I then finished off with a Great Lakes Nosferatu. So all in all, a great brew selection. Plus the .50 wing nights on Tuesday was a bonus.  The not so awesome - the .50 wings were not so awesome. I ordered the Thai and the Caribbean. I think they would have been better off smothering the Caribbean in the Steak 'n' Shake Jamaican sauce. And the Thai was really not Thai at all. They should take a trip to Quaker Steak and at least see what they do with their Thai'r Cracker wings. So the food is somewhat mediocre.  So in short - the beer is 4 stars. The bartenders are 4 stars. Food is more like 2.5 stars. And in my math world, that equals 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good wings good ribs good service good everything at very reasonable prices. My wife and I were in town from New York and we were very impressed!!"}
{"text":"Solid sports bar in downtown Cleveland. They have a nice outdoor patio area, but we chose to eat inside because of the wind. Inside the restaurant, the vibe was laid back, and being a Monday night, it wasn't too crowded. They had TVs everywhere, as you would expect in a sports bar, and from any seat in the place you could see the broadcast of the Indians game. It just so happened to be wing night, which requires you to order in denominations of 5, so I ordered 5 Caribbean Jerk and 5 Thai chili wings. They were crispy and well-coated with their respective sauces. I also had the Bavarian pretzels as an appetizer, which are served with spicy brown mustard and cheese sauce. Everything was very tasty. My goddaughter also very much enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and macaroni and cheese. They had a good selection of both bottled and draft beer. I enjoyed both the GLBC Turntable Pilsner and the Dogfish Head Namaste. My goddaughter loved that they have a Coke Freestyle machine, so she was able to get a Vanilla Coke. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The prices were reasonable. All said and done, I would definitely go to this restaurant again on a return visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We are in Cleveland visiting.  My friend took my daughter (age 11) and I here for dinner.  First, our server never refilled or even offer to refill our ice water. We didn't order beer.  The food was good.  We ordered wings.  There is a large selection of flavors for wings.  Our dinner was very good.  It's a bar setting so it was very loud.  My daughter liked looking at the live lizard.  We enjoyed our meal but its not a place I would return as there are other places to try.  Summary:  It's just OK."}
{"text":"The only thing keeping me from giving this place a higher rating is that they don't have their sign saying \"21 and up\" visible... I walked in one night wanting dinner and since I had eaten there before with my mom after being dropped off at college, I didn't know that you have to be 21+ to even eat there. I asked for a table for one, the waitress acted like she didn't understand me, asked if I wanted to see the menu before I sat down, I repeated that I wanted a table, and she sneered at me and asked to see an ID. I asked her if I could just dine there without drinking, and she barked, \"no!\" and practically shoved me out the door. That was the only time I had ever seen her and usually when I go there with my family, the staff is really nice. But anyways, the wings are great... I just wish I wouldn't be treated like an alien walking in there."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, their burgers are very good and value-wise this is one of the best places in the Coventry area. Service is always great as well, it's one of my favorite spots for sports-watching while eating a bite."}
{"text":"I went here after work one day to have a beer and watch a baseball game, & found exactly what I was looking for.  A loud restaurant with dinner seating & also a bar with 5 or 6 games playing on TV.  The atmosphere was nothing to rave about, the reason I give it a 4 is that they have drink specials every night & dinner specials every night of the week.  I ordered the rib-special, got a 32 oz labatt blue & walked out the door for 15 buks after tip.  The ladies behind the bar were nice, the food was delivered punctually & tasted pretty good.  As long as you're looking for a happy hour / sports game evening, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"This specific location is all about the service - and the service is TERRIBLE.  I go here once a  week, every week, & have the pleasure of being served by the same waitress every time.   I suppose that she has been delegated the \"happy-hour\" timeframe on Tuesday early-eveings, though I must say she doesn't deserve it.  The service is terrible & the attitude is worse.  The service aside, the rest of the location is OK.  The popcorn is always ready & fresh, the $4.25 32 oz. beers, the half-price pizza & $0.35 wings are specials that you can always count on.  A 1 for the service & a 3 for the rest makes a 2.0 rating - try another bar if you're in the area."}
{"text":"i love the winking lizard. it has a great beer selection, which i have conquered (having completed two world tours of beer!). The bar area is huge. There are a ton of tvs showing whatever game is on. It can be kind of annoying during football games.   Wing nights and $5 pizzas on Monday and Tuesday, Rib night on Wednesday and cheaper burgers on Thursday.    i love their salads. I love the turkey burger. And i usually love whatever their seasonal food menu is.    I am happy to have a Winking Lizard near my home!"}
{"text":"I was torn between three and four stars for this one but decided on four since my reasons for three weren't really the establishments fault.  This is one of those places that has it all. Awesome beer cooler, decent food, a friendly staff, great location, and unfortunately the random local weirdos that I seem to attract. Last time I was there there was a gem that sat two stools down and was putting on quite a show (think pacing, bar slapping, and hot sauce all over his face....) before being joined by another who filled the one stool safety gap and began mumbling strange questions to my girlfriend and I that we couldn't even understand. Apparently the two were friends. Shocker...  The handful of times I've been there I've always encountered something strange like this but like I said, I can't fault the bar for who lives down the street. I'm a lover of beer variety and this place has the best cooler I've seen yet. I'm talking hundreds of labels."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 1/2 a star, I would. Bad food, even worse service. Waiter actually said \"You'll get your drinks when the bartender gives them to me\" We waited 25-35 minutes for each round. Probably the one and time going here. It's a shame, it was a recommendation from a friend."}
{"text":"Always consistent with super yummy wings and great service! I pop in every time I'm in CLE! Don't change a thing Lizard! Tip: Caribbean flavored wings are the best!"}
{"text":"Still the best place in my mind to catch a game in Lakewood. We recently stopped in for the OSU win over Michigan and had a great time.   Surprisingly got a table right away, TVs everywhere tuned to what people want to watch. Friendly service from people that get that you want to spend 3 hours there without spending a fortune. And all the free popcorn you can eat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite winking lizard! We live so close to this location that we go pretty regularly.  There are TVs every where! The bar is floor to ceiling TVs and there are even TVs on the patio! What a fun place to catch a game!  Their food is pretty good! We like to go for their wing nights.  Why the one star missing? We've run into bad service a time or two... I know it gets busy but this service can be laughably poor.  We also loveeeee the basement whiskey bar!"}
{"text":"I came in here with my boyfriend to watch an osu game and grab some wings.. I came in with very low expectations (most things this close to the Jake have horrible food and service).. Man was I impressed! The service was great, the wings were very good, and they had cider on tap! (For us gluten free folks!) It was a fun night with a fun crowd!!"}
{"text":"\"Line cooking -- the real business of preparing the food you eat -- is more about consistency, about mindless, unvarying repetition, the same series of tasks performed over and over and over again in exactly the same way. The last thing a chef wants in a line cook is an innovator .... Chefs require blind, near-fanatical loyalty, a strong back and an automaton-like consistency of execution under battlefield conditions.\" - an excerpt from Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain.  Being consistent is what separates a good restaurant from a great one. The lack of consistency can also make a good restaurant less than average. Customers loyal to certain restaurants want to be able to go out, have the meal they seek, recreated exactly how they remember it the last time they had it. Any deviation of this, any letdown from preconceived expectations can lead to hurt feelings not to mention a less than stellar opinion of their once preferred place of dining.   Needless to say, over the years the food at the Winking Lizard has changed and for the worse. A lack of consistency if you will. The pizza dough recipe has changed, so has the sauce. The buffalo chicken wrap is no longer made with breaded chicken, they now use plain, dried out grilled chicken. The BBQ sauce recipe, perhaps what I used to enjoy most about the Lizard has also been altered. The burgers are no longer the same either. It's apparent they now use different buns and a different ground meat.  In general, the food looks sloppily prepared. It's as if the once proud line cooks were replaced overnight with dishwashers and bus boys lacking any sort of previous cooking experience.  I've been patronizing the various NE Ohio Lizard locations for practically my entire life, but in the last few years, I've definitely noticed a change in food quality. I'm willing to bet the changes were a cost-cutting maneuver. It's apparent they've taken steps to purchase cheaper ingredients, alter recipes to save money and/or switch to a cheaper food purveyor.  I understand the hardships and many overheads it takes to keep a restaurant alive for over 25 years, but for fucks sake, if you need to save money, don't do it at the expense of the food! Gasp! The food (and beer) is the reason why you've grown into a community favorite, Mr. Lizard! The continued regression of quality surely isn't going to help to develop new customers, nor is it going to keep you from losing old loyalists.  Why the two stars? The beer. Thankfully, one of the few bright-spots remaining at the Lizard is their stellar selection of bottled and draft varieties."}
{"text":"Large menu of bar foods: burgers, wings, pizza. Preffered pfries are always a good appetizer. Thai wings leave the lips tingling after the meal.   Dining room is loud. Bar is too. Lotsa televisions make it a good place to watch multiple games. Free popcorn."}
{"text":"Overall a good place for drinks and lunch.  Service is adequate and I found the staff to be pleasant.  I must recommend getting the frites -- very similar to steak fries and very good.  I had the house-made black bean burger which was wonderful -- bread was meh as were the fries, but the burger itself is full of flavor and a great choice to make it feel like you're eating healthy while still having something very filling."}
{"text":"Ate here today. Huge parking area in front and back with a fairly easy access from route 82 and 271. Arriving at approximately 6pm on a Saturday I should have assumed it would be busy. They were! They told us it would be a 45 min wait but it was more like 20. It didn't feel long. Plenty of places to sit and wait and games to play. They take your number and text you when you are up. Waitress was nice and the place was staffed well. I constantly saw employees busy working and eager to help. The wait for drinks was minimal. Food felt like it took a bit but that's ok. Tvs are everywhere! There is even a iguana that lives there! Bathrooms were clean but there was only 3 stalls and I couldn't even fit it 2 of them. I'm not a big person either. I weigh 140lbs and I'm 5 foot 6. So it was odd that I couldn't fit! I had to use the handicap bathroom which I hate to do. Thankfully no one needed it while I used it quickly. Now the food was great. I had boneless hot wings. They were great but a little light on sauce. So I asked for more hot sauce which they quickly brought out. I'll be back for more food soon."}
{"text":"When I first started traveling to Cleveland I quickly learned The Winking Lizard is a staple, especially for beer drinkers. The reviews are always split. Either people rave about the beer menu or bash the food. Quite frankly I really enjoyed both.  The beer list is INSANE! So many options. Most of them are on draft, but they also have bottles available. There are also some liquor and wine options (full bar) for those who don't drink beer. The paper menu on the table is your beer list on one side and all kinds of tips and updates on the other. This changes monthly and you can tell a lot of thought is put into it each month. If you're a local and a beer lover it may be worth it for you to sign up for their Beer Tour. Drink 100 beers in a year and you get a special finishers jacket. In early January there is an event for everyone who finished the prior year. It costs $20 to join, but you get it back in the form of a $20 gift card upon finishing. So really it is a win win for beer drinkers.   The food is way better than I think people give it credit for. There is a monthly menu with seasonal options. This is my favorite menu to order from. Everything I've had was delicious. The November and December Beer Cheese options have been my favorite. Their standard menu has a ton of options. Burgers, sandwiches, wings, salads, entrees, appetizers, dessert. They have it all and they have many options of each category/type of food. I've heard quite a few people call it \"typical bar food\" but I really think this is not giving it the proper credit.  The downside is wait time and speed of staff. There is no one assigned to bus or clean the tables. The wait staff have to clear their own table. On top of actually serving their other tables. There won't be a time when you are there and don't see several empty tables still covered in dirty plates. It's frustrating. And it seems like it could be an easy fix. The hosts could chip in and help. They could have one person dedicated to bussing tables and doing other things in their down time. I've never seen this anywhere else. Probably because it takes away from service being provided to the customer. The wait staff have always been fabulous and friendly. They are as fast as the possibly can be, but the business model works against them.   I think really what is going to draw you here is going to be the beer list. If you enjoy trying something new or having a huge variety of options, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I had beer, fried ravioli, beer, hot wings (spicy), beer, and more hot wings (bbq) and i was pretty happy with it. There is a fun atmosphere to this place, good service and personable staff. Prices are average-to-good. It's a bar, with food, but not \"bar food.\" Good times."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the Q, this is a pretty good place to go with friends after attending a sporting event. We've only gone after hockey games and it usually isn't too crowded, but I can't speak for baseball or football season. It was much more packed after the Monsters Browns Night, so I suspect it'd be crazy after more popular sporting events.  Food is standard Wink fare--solid, nothing too special other than the fried macaroni and cheese. I go for the beer selection, which is always fun and enables me to try a new beer each time, which I love."}
{"text":"Usually I'd rate the Winking Lizard better (and I'm kind of ashamed that I haven't reviewed them yet), but after an experience last week? I'm super disappointed and in no hurry to head back any time soon.   I usually love the Winking Lizard for their great beer selection and pretty decent food. The prices are incredibly reasonable - and it's a good place for people watching. However, my dining companion and I did not have a good experience at all. When both people have a beer AND another beverage, and then they are empty for a decent period of time? I was annoyed. More annoyed when I realized that the section I was in wasn't that busy. Where was the waiter? Sadly, that happened throughout the night. I would have complained, but I spent more time waiting for the waiter to appear than I did enjoying my moderately warm food."}
{"text":"Normally I scoff at poor reviews as people that are just never happy or snobbish. I have a restaurant background and understand you just can't hit a home run everyday, though it is always or should be the goal.   I have been to the Winking Lizard many times both in Lakewood and downtown. Usually the experience is good as I enjoy trying different beers and eating bar food while watching a game.   A month ago, I had a terrible experience with less than acceptable food preparation and presentation. But wasn't going to post on Yelp because I chalked it up as one of those days. But here's why I am here.   As stated earlier, I have restaurant experience in management and I know that the complaints are needed as a means to improve service and or food. So I wrote to tell of my experience. The letter was sincere, and was not attacking in any way. As I said, that was a month ago and I have yet to hear from anyone in that Lakewood store or the company.   To me, it told me why the food and service are what they are there. Management is not following up with the customers. I'm not looking for free food or a discount, rather just a thank you for taking the time to write and that they would follow up with the employees.   Unforgivable and I will not return to. Winking Lizard anytime soon.   Joe Hempel Cincinnati, Ohio"}
{"text":"We have been to many of the local Winking Lizards and this location has the worst service.  The food is good, but the service, including the manager, are dreadful.  Slow and disrespectful.  Also, they don't have air conditioning and won't open the doors.  We should have left as soon as we walked in, because it was downhill from there."}
{"text":"I love Winking Lizard, they have a great selection of food and it's soooo good.  I order take out from this location often and they always have it ready when I get there.  The staff goes the extra mile and I've only ever had great customer service."}
{"text":"bad staff bad food very mean close it down manger was mean"}
{"text":"I wished they had a place like this here in California. It's a great hangout place and the food is yummy. It looks like they offer a variety of flavors of beer. I mean in the hundreds."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to grab some American pub fare. Stick to the wings and beer, you will leave happy. Outdoors is a very nice patio, worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great place for pub food and beer!  The Winking Lizard is a regional favorite in Ohio. They boast an extensive beer list and great wing and sandwich selections.   This is a place you can hang out comfortably for hours. Large dining room (with seating for larger parties), bar area with plenty of TVs for your sport-viewing pleasure, and a patio to enjoy the 30 seconds of temperate weather a year Ohio has to offer!  This is the perfect spot to meet up after work for a drink, catch a game, or wow beer lovers from out of town."}
{"text":"Should've stuck with the wings....got a \"grilled\"chicken Sandwhich (it was burnt) and a side of Mac n cheese (worst I ever had way over cooked). Might have to find a better place next time in Cleveland or stick to the wings. My husband got a burger he said it was great, that's why I left 3 stars."}
{"text":"The servers here were consistently fast and cheerful, even though my friends from work and I were loud, obnoxious and intoxicated. It was a Friday night, so maybe that's just par for the course.   For some reason, I got the \"Big Ed Burger,\" which is a full pound of hamburger, cheese, and the piece de resistance, a whole bunch of bacon. Dayum. It was maybe the best burger I've had in the whole of the Cleveland diaspora. Add to that a couple pints of Christmas Ale, and you've got an All-American Friday Night Guys' Night Out. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We come here often for beers.  The beer list is solid and they usually have something interesting on draft.  I hear that they are completely redoing their beer list at the beginning of the year.  We always get great service at this location.  The food is ok, but the 4 stars are for the beers and service."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to visit this place since it was convenient to our hotel. It was a bit crowded but we didn't mind. It happened to be the opening day of baseball and the Cleveland Indians were playing. I ordered the shrimp and crab quesadillas and my coworker ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Typical bar food, right. Also, let me add that it was a Monday night and on Mondays, wings are $0.55 each.   I was unimpressed with my meal. While my quesadilla had a nice taste, there were way too many chopped onions on it. Every bite was a bit crunchy from all of the bits of chopped onion. The quesadilla was a nice size that came cut into four pieces. After eating the first piece, I was ready to stop eating. I ate another piece and by that time, I was done. Our waiter offered a to-go box, which I took. I ended up throwing the rest of that quesadilla in the trash later.  I don't think I'd visit this place again."}
{"text":"While staying at the Hampton Inn down the street, I came in here for dinner one evening.  I had the French Onion Soup and the Cobb Salad. The French Onion Soup was to salty. The salad was not bad, but the vegetables did not feel as fresh as they could be.  I also had a pint of one of the many local IPAs they carry, then had a sampler of five other Ohio/regional IPAs. The Ales were all excellent - I enjoyed them very much!  I sat at the bar and watched some of the Cleveland Indians vs. Detroit Tigers game. Lots of large flat panel HD TVs permeate the place.  Service was good. I'd come back here again - maybe try the wings next time. The place closes at 9:00 pm during the week."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner - as it was not to far from the hotel I was staying at for a few days (Cleveland Marriott East).   Sat at a high top in the bar area. My server was named Nancy as I recall. She was a real card - cracking herself up with her jokes and stuff. She was a real character!  I ordered a burger, medium - that was seasoned with Cajun spice and topped with Blue Cheese, saut√©ed mushrooms, and bacon, san bun - and subbed grilled veggies for fries. The veggies were a medley of cauliflower, onion, red bell pepper, and squash. It also came with a dill pickle. I enjoyed the dill pickle spear enough that I asked for a second!  I also ordered a pint of the Mosaic Hero IPA (7.5% ABV) (Revolution Brewing Co., Chicago, IL). Nice IPA - good balance of hops, pine resin, citrus, and floral elements.  The burger was tasty - loved the Cajun seasoning and Blue Cheese. The one thing I will ding them on is the burger meat itself - had a bit of gristly/chewiness to parts of it. Needed to be a little more tender. The grilled veggies were good.  After my meal, I ordered one more Ale - a can of the Anti-Hero IPA (6.5% ABV) - also from Revolution Brewing Co. AN enjoyable ale, but I prefer the Mosaic Hero IPA between the two.  Service was good. Fun place! I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis for Wings Night on Tuesdays.  I'll still give the Wink a really wide beer selection and pretty decent food.  However, I've been increasingly disappointed by their food and service lately.  The service here is extremely slow.  It takes about 10 minutes for you to get your drink order in and then another 10 minutes after getting your drinks to order your food.  I'll give it to them that the waiters are relatively polite and accommodating, but the wait after the wait is a little ridiculous.  In terms of food, their sliders were dry and I couldn't even finish 2 of them.  I still like their wings, but they've started charging for ranch, bleu cheese, and even celery.  I think it's pretty unreasonable to charge people for typical garnishes and condiments needed for wings.  It's almost synonymous with charging people for ketchup with their fries.  I still plan on coming back for my wings fix, but not for much else."}
{"text":"Went to this \"restaurant\" with my 28 year old cousin and 24 year old sister and was denied access because I am under 21 years old and was not accompanied by a parent or guardian. It was 5:30pm when we went. I was under the impression that this establishment was a bar AND a restaurant. What happened to IDing if someone is ordering a drink? Guess they won't be receiving my business before OR after 5pm for now on."}
{"text":"My least favorite of the Lizards.  The staff is always rude and the place is way too cramped.  On my most recent visit we waited 20 minutes for our first beer.  When I still have 35 more beers on the tour left before the end of the year I need to get crackin.  The server seemed to care less when I had to ask her for my beers..  After that I ordered 2 at a time..lol.  Dont try that at home kids!  Anyways, if your at Coventry and want food thats not a sports bar or an uptight hippie joint...try this one.  Ya wont see me reviewing too many East Side places so here ya go suckas!  The east side gives my instant diarreah.."}
{"text":"My fav location.  Bowling alley is so overpriced noone ever uses it..what a shame..  Service can be great if ya get the right server.  Plenty of games for the kiddies!"}
{"text":"They focus on local beers...what a novel idea...wish other Cleveland bars did..  Let me preface this that I am a HUGE Lizard fan and have done the beer tour 8 years now.  Went to the new Winking Lizard concept last night called Winks.  Its in the Galleria which has been a shopping graveyard downtown for years now but I like how they repurpose old buildings and bring new life to em!  This motif is kind of a sports bar (I think) with a LOCAL focus...which is awesome.  I know the place is brand new but the service was awful.  We walked in, sat down and within 30 seconds the bearded manager dude tells us they close at 10 but will probably be staying open a tad later (gee thanks)!  So, I am on the beer tour and asked if beers bought here count on the tour (which they do) so I asked for a printout.  Bearded dude proceedes to just ask me what I want and he said he will tell me if any of the other Lizards have that on tap so I dont get the same beer twice for my tour.  Now, wouldnt just printing the fricking list of what I HAVE had be way easier?!  He seemed like he was in a huge rush to get us out the door.  No wonder there was 10 people in the whole bar...  Now the beers they DO have and that count for the tour have no numbers next to em to signify the corresponding number to the tour.  So, basically if ya want a beer to count on your tour ya have to look down your whole list and see if you have already had it?  Not too easy when ya have already had 80 beers..lol.  We eventually did find 2 beers that did count and drank em.  Didnt want to bother beard man for another!  As we finished the 2 beers we had and paid we watched like 10 employees cleaning everything including the jukebox...but not interating with customers who are actually spending money.  Guess a shiny jukebox is a must for downtown bars to thrive?  I get the vibe that this bar is gonna cater to the white, middle-aged, business traveler who is used to crappy downtown service.  It has ZERO corner bar appeal and with customer service like that people will go elsewhere.   After 2 quick beers we left and went somewhere else and drank.  From what I hear they basically hired all new staff for this store and have a crazy martini list with egg whites and all that.  Now, with customer service like I just saw all the martinis and shiny jukeboxes in the world will not work.  When downtown Cleveland is dead on a Thurday nite ya might wana get some local people to fill those seats...but we wont if we can go somewhere else and actually feel welcomed.."}
{"text":"Good location, friendly people..mostly.  But parking still blows..ugh.."}
{"text":"Great lunch with the guys. The Gateway WL now has potato pancakes instead of fries.  I thought they would be full size but nope; bite size and quite tasty.    Service is always quick during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious wings. I had the honey garlic sauce based on our waiters recommendation and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is what it is....fried food with live lizard as a gimmick. They have a fun 4 mile run in the summer that ends with a street party outside the restaurant.....but that's about it. Save your money. Better yet, go to Great Lakes Brewing Company. It's in the area and the beer and food is a bit better."}
{"text":"Ive ordered here two times in lakewood location.  First time to go order of a cheddar club. I specifically asked for ranch and pickle. Get there waited 10 minutes until a hostess even came over charged for the ranch and there was no ranch on my sandwich or pickle when i got home. Also no utensils or napkins.  I thought id try again and give them another chance. Ordered to go told them about adding ketchup ranch and pickles. Again no pickles condiments or utensils and the portion of the fries was a joke. My friend and i counted our fries literally ten fries. I forgot to mention when i walked in and asked for my to go order she said walk to the bar as she was just standing there talking to a boy that was not a customer . Rude. Seems like the hostesses need more training learned my lesson never going to lakewood location again. Too many restaurants to choose from that will be glad for my business."}
{"text":"I spent 3 days in the Cleveland area and my hotel was close by to the Independence location.  Since I flew in on a Monday I wanted to catch the MNF games and this was the spot recommended which was a great call.  I ended up there the next two nights as well.  Living in San Diego I have yet to find chicken wings that come close to how good the wings were here.  I'm definitely a fan of the spicy bbq wings.  Nice large selection of beers on tap and I think somewhere over 100 including bottles.  Plenty of tv's to watch the games.  Friendly service to boot.  If I ever end up back in the Cleveland area I'll be heading back."}
{"text":"Winking lizard was such a fun bar to go to. With so many different types of beer, you can always add some novelty to your night out. It is a little more expensive than your average bar, but worth it to try out some new brews!"}
{"text":"In town to watch the Yankees beat the Indians. Good place to grab a beer before the game. They had a nice beer selection. We got a wrap and some wings. The food was okay, I thought the wrap was small. They also gave you blue cheese for wings in a Ken's pre-packaged container, weak.  I would go back for a beer before a game if I am ever back but I wouldn't eat there again. Also, seemed like a lot of other options in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to so many winking lizards and all of them have had great service food and atmosphere! This was the first time at the new mayfield hts. One and the patio is so nice! Two fire pits and plenty of TVs!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Just had wings and beer.  The wings were good, but needed more sauce.  I would have given five stars but I asked for more sauce and they charged me a dollar!  Service was ok, not the greatest but it wasn't bad.  We will definitely go back.  Just hope the wings have sauce on them next time...."}
{"text":"the winking lizard coventry - cleveland heigths OH closed 10-Aug-2016"}
{"text":"Overall: It's a higher priced local chain burger restaurant and bar.  Burgers are very good and beer selection is excellent.  Solid place, but not very differentiated from other local burger restaurants.  Food & Drinks: 4 stars.  They have about a dozen hamburger types, but they are fairly common combinations (BBQ/cheddar/bacon, swiss/mushroom/onions, etc).  I had a classic burger, and it was cooked very well and tender.  Beer selection is excellent.  Service: 3 stars.  The server did a basic level of service.  The food and drinks came out reasonably fast.  She was most social and pleasant when she brought the check and it was time for the tip.  Prices: 3 stars.  They have decent happy hour specials, but the regular prices are fairly high.  Regular burger prices are $9-$10, but Thursday prices are $7.  Happy hour draft beers are $1 off.  Atmosphere: 3 stars.  I attended prior to an Indians game.  They have a live lizard, which is good for kids.  Otherwise it's a basic casual restaurant setup."}
{"text":"Good draft and bottle list. Food was good. Nothing amazing but a solid place for lunch and dinner or before a baseball game ."}
{"text":"While convenient for those staying in the surrounding hotels or working in the business park, this location lacks any personality.  The interior was cluttered; the outdoor seating might have been better.  The beer selection was great as usual, and the wait staff was good, but the Stuffed Peppers I got were under-cooked, and I got food poisoning from it.  Needless to say, no recommendation there.  I don't see any reason for anyone other than the \"captive\" audience to stop here, and if they do, stick to the burgers!"}
{"text":"Great informal place in which to eat. Plan to wait but it is worth it"}
{"text":"THE FAST AND DIRTY: True rating: 3.5 stars.  I come here too often to deny that I'm a fan though, hence the 4 stars.  PROS: excellent AND cheap hot wings; largest quality craft beer collection mine eyes have ever seen (and yes that includes the Tremont Taphouse)  CONS: service that seems to struggle with keeping up, even when customer volume isn't that high; kooky ambiance when the occasional odd characters are allowed to roam.  AMBIANCE: dive-y, spacious sports bar with more dive and less sports. Can get crowded but stays curiously, relatively low-key even during big games.  Crowd is mixed--can range from families with toddlers to ladies night out, ages averaging late 20s to 50s.  ... BECAUSE YOU LOVE TO HEAR ME TALK: If you're a fan of hot wings and craft beers, the Winking Lizard Tavern should be at the top of your bucket list.    BEER: 307 different bottled craft brews available, a rotating collection of 20 on tap every month.  Your name on the wall if you do their \"world tour\" and polish off 100 from their selected 200 list in the span of a year.  Need I say more?  No, but I can't resist: they carry hard-to-find brews from the the likes of Left Hand, First Amendment, Troegs, Unibroue, Rogue, Victory, Samuel Smith, Ommegang, Dogfish, Jolly Pumpkin, Magic Hat, and Lindemans, just to name a few.  And of course brews from the GLBC--they assume (and rightly so) that if you're there, an acronym will suffice. Victory recently came out with a limited-edition Lizardbock in honor of the WLT.  My newest crush, Porterhouse's Oyster Stout, isn't even carried at Warehouse Beverage.    WINGS: The last three times we've gone, the bf and I didn't even go in to drink.  Pop and a dozen wings each for dinner--ten bucks apiece including tip.  Winning!  They tout 16 different flavors on the menu for their wings, with each flavor descriptor complete with cartoons of whimsical lizards, some dressed in slightly racist outfits.  I've tried most of them under the two hottest (Magma and 911) spiciness levels--all fairly tasty--but nothing beats their normal Hot wings.    Important tip: DON'T go for wings on their promo 40 cent wing nights (every Monday and Tuesday) if  you want fresh, juicy wings crisped to perfection.  We went during one of their promo nights and ordered just over two dozen: the quality plummeted.  They must pre-cook larger batches and/or use scrappier meat in anticipation of the higher volume: there were several duds in our batch--some with meat so dried/chewy that there wasn't much left to do with them except suck the sauce off and move to the next.    On non-promo nights, the wings are only 10 cents more--a phenomenal 50 cents apiece.  Nearly half the price of Quaker Steak and a quite bit tastier.  Totally worth it.  SERVICE: Rushed, prone to errors/forgetting details, but earnest.  There were times though, when the follow-up was minimal, even when the place was more than half-empty.    Once, I accidentally knocked over my iced tea and wanting to keep anyone from slipping on the ice, mopped up the cubes with my napkin and put them back in my cup with the soiled napkin.  When she came back around, I gave the cup back to my server, explaining what happened.  I received another iced tea a  minute later but then realized, halfway through, that the wadded-up napkin was sitting at the bottom of the cup under the ice the whole time.  Without a word, the server immediately replaced that with my third glass of iced tea--I just wanted water by that time.  It nearly took away the bf's appetite but there wasn't much to do at that point.  WRAP IT UP: While I can vouch for the craft beer and hot wings, I haven't had too much in the way of food other than salad and burgers, both of which were pretty good.  For a low-key, relaxed night out with friends or fam, or even to watch a sports game without sweaty strangers bellowing in your ear, WLT Independence will do the trick."}
{"text":"It took a minute to order and even longer to get my food, but it was worth the wait.  Located one block from my hotel in downtown Cleveland it was walking distance which was a plus.  The food is good and the atmosphere was nice.  I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, nachos and beer.  Lots of TV's and they have NHL Center ice, what else could you ask for.  Could be cleaner."}
{"text":"If you like overpriced beers and mediocre bar food, this place is for you! The service I received was horrendous. I will not be returning for a very long time."}
{"text":"I would say Wink's is a good lunch spot or a good place to come drink beer and watch sports. They have a good draft beer selection and flat screen TV's everywhere. I came here for lunch one day and I had the pressed buffalo chicken wrap and it was very delicious! They serve it with bleu cheese dipping sauce but I asked for ranch dressing instead. The fries were excellent and were seasoned perfectly.   I've been to Winking Lizard many times before and I wouldn't say Wink's is a step up but just more geared toward being a family friendly restaurant rather than a bar. They have a huge outdoor patio space which is nice in the summer. Our service was good and our waitress was very nice.  I've heard from some co-workers that they have really good wings so I would recommend trying that if you go there. But don't forget you can't go wrong with the buffalo chicken wrap as well!"}
{"text":"When looking for a weeknight hangout on Cleveland's east side, look no further than this Coventry location. An extensive and ever evolving beer list will keep you entertained for months...except by then there are enough new offerings that you have cause to play some more! The collection of brews is not a who's who of beers (on Coventry, you'll have to go to La Cav Du Vin for that), but but the extensive collection guarantees you'll find something to meet your needs.   Biggest problem will be getting a table on a weekend night and getting a table is almost a necessity at this location as actual bar space is extremely limited. The front door is something of a crowded mess of people desiring seating.  I think this situation is the common turnoff for many people.  However, once seated, you're golden. The excellent waitstaff will be able to help select a beer and make sure your needs are met. The sectioning of the restaurant into a few rooms makes for a cozier, more personal experience, which will be very appreciated by you and your table-mates.  This is a great place to watch a game (not a great place to watch THE game)- the pub atmosphere is enough to knock out the sports bar feel, allowing the experience to be quality and peaceful. This pub/restaurant feel prevents a restaurant-wide 'mood' (thus, not a place for the big game), but this is probably the main appeal for many people (other than the desire to get away from the kind of crowds at the bars of Coventry).   One of the limits on giving a five star rating is the food: standard bar/grease joint fare. However, there is certainly an extensive menu.  Food is executed decently, but it's still a cheeseburger. At least the popcorn is free. But what is only average food is redeemed through specials. Well worth an artery clogging trip is Wing Night. Super cheap with many sauces to meet your needs.  The drink specials can be quite the draw as well. The drink of the month will reward the purchaser with some souvenir glass- or ceramic-ware."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon during football season, but on a Sunday when the Browns had played on Thursday.  We were surprised to see the place very busy, but were seated at a table on the bar side quickly.  Service was quick and friendly.  I got mild wings with celery and french fries and a Bahama Mama.  Everything was good..  A great place to watch a ballgame."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard Tavern was a convenient stop for us on a Wednesday night. Located just around the block from our hotel, we had no problem walking to this location. It was about 8:00pm when the 4 of us in my group decided to give the place a try. When we walked in we were greeted and asked what type of seating arrangement we would like. After getting seated our drink orders were taken quickly. Our drinks arrived by way of a different waitress who sat the wrong drink with the wrong person. Not a huge deal I suppose but not ideal regardless. The waitress for our table was very friendly but maybe a little too much in an obnoxious way. My order of 10 traditional style wings came out very hot. The flavor was outstanding, I loved every last one of them. It was fairly busy at this time since the Cavalier's crowd was still in town. But overall I had a good experience and would eat here again."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue...exactly 18 yrs overdue.  I have been a fan of this Winking Lizard location since 1998 which was my first visit to any Winking Lizard and I continue to stop in. This is where I learned about Belgium ales way back when.  Their beer list list is definlty solid with a huge varity, probably one of the largest in the Cleveland area,over 100 beers by the bottle.  Overall the food and service has been consistant for the most part.  I'm a fan and I will probably contuine to visit."}

Thursday: $5.79 Burgers  All day Sunday: $6.79 BBQ half chicken with slaw and spud.  BEERS: They have specials on 32oz beers all week, but the best beers are usually Monday and Tuesday. As of this writing: MT: Dortmunder Gold WTF: Labatt Blue SS: Miller Lite  They also have happy hour from 3-7 where you get $1 off all 22 draft beers, margaritas, and cocktails for two(?).  I typically go for wings during the week. It's also a pretty decent place to watch the Buckeyes on Saturday."}
{"text":"To begin, I tend not to frequent stores or restaurants that use live animals as mascots. A shop cat or the family dog--sure. But I loathe when places use exotic animals as living decor. It's downright abusive, and it's a practice that needs to stop. (I'm looking at you, Winking Lizard and Marc's.)  However, when I do have to go to the Winking Lizard, this particular spot is tolerable. It isn't crowded with too many bros, the dining room and bar are separated for less noise, and it has skee ball machines in the back. The food is good, though the beer and cider prices could be cheaper.   Food and locale: pretty good. Using a live animal who's lifespan is longer than most servers' careers as a mascot: not cool."}
{"text":"The hotel recommended this spot because it was close.  The service was less than desirable and food uneventful.  If your downtown CLE then hit up a local place this is a chain inside a mall."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is bar and a restaurant in one. They have plenty of options of food to choose from.  I usually go there for the pizza and it has always been good. Their patio is a great size with plenty of seating. They also have an outside bar to, which would be nice in the summer.  The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. The place is very family friendly as well."}
{"text":"Thursday 6/27 1:15 pm.  Lunch with my wife and daughter.  The place was dirty, not just the days dirt.  Floor and bathrooms.  Our table was sticky.  Good thing the lighting was real low, in fact difficult to read some items on the menu, because it was probably filthy everywhere.  The service fast and the waitress knowledgable.  Food expensive for lunch and the quality average, almost fast food like.  The chicken over-cooked and tough.  The music was 70's rock and boring.  The place needs a through cleaning, I mean now.  Food still would be over priced.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I have been and continue to be a big fan of the Lizard. It is my go to place for good, fresh, casual food. I have been to this location close to 20 times, and must say the food here is just not up to par with other Lizards. Maybe it's the cooks, maybe the food manager, but the food is just fair here. Many times the food comes out cold. Someone needs to pay more attention here."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I did not come here for the food.  While there was no Gluten Free menu, my server was very helpful in pointing out and double checking with the kitchen what I could and could not have. In the end, I opted for some potato skins and a burger with cheese.     What made the night were the drinks and the atmosphere. They were reasonably priced, and the bar had a nice tv setup. I mean watching 3 different MLB games at once was great.   If I find myself in Cleveland and I'm having difficulties trying to decide which game to watch and don't want to play the channel flipping game, I will definitely keep the Winking Lizards on my bar list."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a beer. Service was slow and there weren't that many people when I was there. Didn't eat, and didn't see any food come out, so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Great beer prices, selection, and big tvs to watch the game. Convenient to downtown hotels and first energy. We came for the women's world cup and had some of the wings and pfreds pfries. Pretty good all around. Beers are def the strong suit."}
{"text":"Came here last year on a road trip and loved it so we came back. Even with a different menu and seasonal beer change, they still were excellent. If driving through Cleveland like us, it's an easy stop off the 90 and worth it for a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"4 of us went to dinner and 3 were great.  The issue was the fish and chips.  Take it of the menu!  Old frozen Haddock doesn't cut it when your place is so close the lake.    Have a good perch dinner or something like that.  Other 3 meals were great.    Beer selection was great.   Service was ok.   Seemed pretty clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars that being said the food is always great, wanting to always trying something new. If there is ever an issue (which is next to never) they are extremely prompt on making it right. Oh and there beer!! It is out oft this world, between draft / bottle / can they can please any palate. Everyone is wonderful, but exceptional service comes from the bartenders. Aaron, Jamee, Emily ... you guys are great!"}
{"text":"Providing suitably dark ambiance, a wealth of sports-blaring televisions (and salacious A Christmas Story leg lamps for that special Cleveland panache) as well as a capacious barroom, and more-than-impressive draft selection, the Winking Lizard is a contender for one of the best local taverns in town...at least in theory. On a recent visit, however, your reviewer discovered things are a bit amiss in the land of the Liz. The hostess, while friendly, provided one patron a menu, the laminated pages of which were quite literally fused together with beer. Peeling said pages apart to peruse the menu's contents sounded a lot like a person unseating themselves from a poolside lounger in summer. The smells of trapped yeast the menu released in due course were unbelievably rich and fetidly textured. The waiter, to his credit, was quick and affable, but the black bean burger he provided was a markedly greasy affair, the bun so saturated that butter could probably have been slurped from its crevices with ease. The same greasy retinue pervaded the onion rings as well, which rings it should be noted, were indeed ample, and accompanied the bean burger free of a pesky upcharge. Sober in the mid-afternoon, these elements were not as appreciated (or as easily overlooked) as they would likely be on a Friday night after sucking down a few high ABV brews, so the reader would be wise to take my 'A-OK' rating with a sizeable grain of salt."}
{"text":"Met a friend here while on a business trip and had a good meal.  Thankfully we needed to meet a little on the early side - we got a booth around 5:30 and the place filled up QUICKLY.  They have a huge number of choices (salads, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, bbq, etc.).  I went for a custom burger with fontina, grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms.  It was super yummy and the fries were delish!  Lemonade was so-so.  Service was very friendly, though I did have to ask a couple of times for things that should've been a given (extra napkins, our ketchup bottle was empty, etc.).  Parking is a little rough as it's a strip mall so lots of other shops/restaurants competing for parking space."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed when taking the family for some good bar food.  Servers are always friendly and I never had to send my food back which is a pretty big deal.   Bonus : whiskey room downstairs"}
{"text":"The sever was super nice and patient with us as we figured out the menu. Huge TVs everywhere give you a view of any game you want - I'm not a sports guy, but it's pretty sweet.  They have that fancy coke dispenser that had thirty drink options, and the place mat is a tour of beers, with five limited availability beers and seasonal rotations.  In fact, it's a bit overwhelming.  The fried pickles were pretty okay - breaded instead of battered as I prefer, but mostly crispy.  On the other hand, my wings were fantastic - that lip burn that says, \"I don't care how ridiculous I look with an orange beard, I can't stop eating these spicy garlic wings.\" The caribbean wings were also quite good.  Overall, I'll be happy to return and try new things like the 16\" French bread pizza which our neighbor table ordered."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. Too bad that I can't give 0 stars. If this is the type of service I can expect from a downtown Cleveland restaurant, I never want to visit again. The hostess made no eye contact, I wasn't sure that she was seating us or another guest. It was a Tuesday evening, light customer traffic, plenty of seating and staff. After being seated we waited about 7 minutes for David to arrive and take our drink order. Was rudely informed they were out of the Stone Go To IPA which was a special. After we were served our drinks, we waited another 7 or so minutes before we asked someone to bring our waiter back to us. David finally showed back up and took our order. We were seated right by the food prep area, so I watched our meals sit for 10 minutes before the were picked up by another server. 1 meal was wrong. There was no silverware on the table and we had to find another server to bring us some. Both our drinks sat empty until we again had to ask someone to bring David to us. Then he forgot my beer. This is my first impression of Cleveland and it sucks badly. I have to spend the rest of the week here. I will not return to the Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"This location is kind of hidden behind Eastgate Shopping Center across from the movie theater.  Their menu is impressive as it has many types of items that should satisfy most tastes.  The ribs, wings and burgers are the stand out items that I enjoy the most.  There are a variety of salads to choose from if you want to go light.  This place is huge with lots of tables and bar space.  The staff has been spot on my visits.  Lots of TVs, daily specials, huge beer selection and free self serve popcorn.  What more could you ask for?  A high recommend for hanging out with friends and watching games while eating some good food."}
{"text":"I find myself stopping in here regularly. They have a fine beer selection and happy hour specials. A variety types of food on the menu.  Great burgers and fries, beer battered fish, wings, wraps and salads. Chicken fingers and pizza are available on then kids menu. I've have most of the items here. The deep fried pickles are a nice treat.   The self service popcorn machine in the lobby is a nice touch. At the bar, I find I get pretty quick service than sitting at the tables. I think if the place is busy table service can be a little slower but not too bad. Friendly staff here.  A nice place to unwind after work or to take the family to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"So of course, a week after experiencing Winking Lizard Tavern at the Beachwood location I go to the Bedford location! I wasn't crazy about my first experience, but I figured EH WHY NOT when I was asked to go to this one. I found this atmosphere better. Right when I walked in the hostess was making me laugh. When I went to go sit down I was like, OH SHIT - because there was a large cage with a lizard inside of it. What the fuck?? Props for taking their own name seriously!  I had the nacho appetizer for my dinner, because EH WHY NOT (I'm starting to see a trend here). I wasn't really into it in the grand scheme of things, since they used cheese that hardened quickly. Liquid-y, yellow-y nacho cheese is a guilty pleasure of mine, and it could have definitely used more of it. My dinner companion ordered a burger, which since the week earlier I had tried so I didn't bother eating any of his. Per usual, the drink selection was vast and I must of approved of whatever I ordered because I know I drank it all."}
{"text":"I don't know really what to say about this place! Pretty basic as far as local bars go. I was expecting to be more impressed or enamored since it seems many people enjoy going here, but I found it pretty typical. Food was good but nothing outstanding. I actually ate a burger, which is strange for me! I rarely enjoy burgers, but this one wasn't half bad. I mean, I ate it after all! Beer selection was large however, so I'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that. I do not really drink beer though."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, quite nice selection of bourbons too, especially for a location this far north. AND THERE'S AN IGUANA!!! I really, really like iguanas. They're just lovely animals. The bartender was friendly but not fake and all the other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves, without going overboard. Plenty of TVs but not overwhelmingly loud.   Great place to wile away a couple hours swapping horror stories about dating in your 30s. Yeesh. Glad I wasn't on a date and could actually enjoy my Holy Moses beer.  :)  Oh yeah, there are hooks under the bar. Yay! Under-bar hooks and bed-side outlets...they mean a lot to me."}
{"text":"Great place for what it is.  Great beer selection, great people and food.  Becky in the bar is the best!"}
{"text":"I've stayed next to the Winking Lizard many times, but only recently ventured in when here for a work conference.  My local co-workers are also big fans so they decided to do an after work happy hour here.  Plenty of beer and liquor choices and a great 50 cent wing special on Mondays and Tuesdays.    I went a bit plain for dinner, ordering a bunless burger and it was cooked well and a generous portion size.  This place does get quite busy so it must be quite a staple in the area and their food and drink specials don't disappoint."}
{"text":"100+ brands of beer, above average food for a sports bar (they server 'til 11pm), atleast 50 or so TV's always with the big games on. Always starts getting packed about an hour and a half before Cavs games."}
{"text":"Why yes, I will hold it against the company because they took away Lizardville. This is just another bland Stinking Gizzard, and a very small one at that. It's useful for its patio, which overlooks a scenic suburban parking lot, but that's about it."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Great food and service. Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Let's start with something positive: Winks is better than the vacant space in the Galleria that it replaced. God knows there needs to be more action in there. Maybe I just went on an off day, but I just didn't think Winks was anything special. Yeah, local beers, local booze, we get it. Newsflash: you're not the only ones offering that. The menu was a hybrid between your typical Winking Lizard fare and its cousin Lizardville, which is to say that it was better than a kick in the teeth, but still none too exciting. My roasted veggie wrap was good. Not great.   My experience started out a little rough, with a greeter who either didn't like people or was just having a bad day. Either way, I went to my table feeling like I was inconveniencing him. Our server was mercifully more quick and cheerful than he was.   One very positive note: it is 21 and over after 5 pm. I'll be back to try it then, and perhaps I'll be a bit sunnier about Winks with a cold beer in my hand."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about this place, including the fact that it's huge, thus relatively easy to find a table around lunchtime, and the service is usually great. Notice the food was not the first thing I mentioned. It's serviceable, and fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong- I vastly prefer this local chain to some McCasual chain, and I will keep patronizing it. But the lunch scene downtown is getting more competitive, and the Lizard should keep this in mind.  Perhaps I'm just cranky because I never get to sample their huge beer list when I go for lunch. That alone is worth a trip if you're in the neighborhood. And the wings are pretty good if you've had a few selections from the list.  Bonus points for featuring the only live iguana downtown."}
{"text":"I've been a bit discouraged with places to eat lately and this place looks a lot more exciting than it really is.  The parking is ok - the service was good - the selection was ok - and the price was reasonable, but it seems a bit outdated - like nothing is new!  I will return to see if they've changed anything up over time and hope that things improve some."}
{"text":"Food was good however they just redid the tables so unless u enjoy being overwhelmed by polyurethane maybe go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Just got done eatting here and tried a good sample of stuff. First and foremost the beer selection is insane!!! The detail in the list as well is very nice so you know what it is where it is from and the alcohol content. As for the appetizers we tried the southwestern egg rolls and the loaded skins. The Potato skins were pretty run of the mill, but the southwestern egg rolls were AMAZING! So much flavor and the spicy ranch it came with just puts it over the top. We got 2 types of wings one with their 6 pepper dry rub and the other with the garlic parmesan dry rub. Both of them were some of the best wings I have every had. The skin was so crunchy and full of flavor I could of ate them all day. Of coarse you can get sauces or Bleu cheese to go with them but you honestly don't need it. Also tried the gyro, it had alot of meat but all and all didn't have great flavor. The rueben was really good with alot of meat and just enough sauerkraut. This is a place I will be visiting again without a doubt."}
{"text":"This is a big hit for all of the corporate fellows that work in the business part of Independence.  It's probably one of the more laid back and fun bars in the area.  We like to go here after work to celebrate occasions, but more often we come here to mourn the loss of laid off coworkers.  Service is a little slow sometimes, but that's mostly because its busy.  They get an A-OK instead of Yay! I'm a Fan, because their patio kind of sucks."}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit before Browns and Indians games (with the idea that you do need to arrive relately early with gameday crowds, as in any other restaurant). I've mostly been here before Browns games and my four star review contains nothing about wings.   1) The have gluten free beer. It's Redbridge (not my favorite) and it's in a bottle. But hey, how many sports restaurants actually carry the only type of beer I can drink? Kudos to you Lizard.   2) They have a black bean southwestern style veggie burger that is great! It's great to see a delicious tasting entree for us vegetarians (you have to remember that some of us so have meat loving friends and frequently go to places that are not always obviously vegetarian friendly).   Overall love coming here before sports games because I get to feel like I fit in with my friends because a) get to drink beer and b) don't have to eat a salad.   *Note: Although they have the gluten free beer, the veggie burger and the bun are not. As gluten intolerant instead of celiac the burger doesn't upset me and I just order it sans bun."}
{"text":"Went to the winking lizard on a Sunday afternoon in Mayfield Heights the waitress in the bar delivered our food and spilled coleslaw all over my sisters lap , I ordered the potato skins loaded they were awful my sister ordered chicken and it was undercooked  Our grandson ordered chicken wings asked  for a sauce that wasn't spicy and received the spiciest sauce ever Needless to say we will not be returning winking lizard used to be my favorite restaurant I couldn't wait to stop there, never again !!!"}
{"text":"Traveled from NYC on a whim to catch the Indians' ALCS game this past Saturday; needed a place to go to grab some food and drink.  Was walking distance from our hotel so we chose The Winking Lizard.  Great space, lot's of TV's.  Grabbed a spot on the bar.  Service was not the greatest - bartender never asked us if we wanted another drink or even checked in to see if we were ok.  It wasn't overly busy either.  Food was acceptable but nothing special. Boneless wings seemed like they were frozen and heated up. I'm from out of town so maybe I just was there on an off night, but we left after our one drink. I'd still give it another shot but downtown seems to be going through a bit of a revival, so there are probably better options."}
{"text":"Ok. So I am a sucker for the Lizard. I love the beers, burgers, wings.  I love the place. Too bad the Lizard management chose this noisy ( you have to SCREAM to order) space as their new Indy location.   Too bad the Lizard management chose a space where there is no parking. Too bad the lizard management continues to chose to crank the volume on the music here (as I said it is loud...that is not including the music, the music just makes it worse).  It is so loud, my teenage son won't go. Too bad this place is just someplace I will never go again."}
{"text":"You must remember: you are going to a chain tavern. Is the food gourmet? Probably not, but are the beers cold and the burgers juicy? Yes. They were kid friendly, fast, and clean.  I like that they have a delicious vegetarian burger along with more traditional fare. The service was welcoming and our drinks hardly wanted for a refill. We have been here before and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food, great location...I wish I would have written down the Waitress's name because she was so attentive, pleasant and made it another great visit to this family spot to watch sports together"}
{"text":"I visited two WL on my week trip to Cleveland and was impressed with both.   First off, coming from Portland where beer is king, finding mainly Bud Light and similar at most bars is...sad. Yeah, that does sound snobby but there's only so much cheap beer I can stomach. So to find a bar with a big beer list was like manna from heaven.   They also have a pretty wide selection of food, the primary being wings of course. This time around, however, I got a special that was a spicy shrimp & crab quesadilla - I know, risky right? Who orders seafood at a place like this? ME!   It was actually pretty freaking good for what it was. Definitely tasted fresh and was just about as loaded as could be.   Service was quick & prompt despite it being busy after a Cav/Indian games. Oh, who am I kidding - even as an outside I can tell those games are never busy."}
{"text":"Overall place is good. Servers can be non attentive at shift change. But their shift change is around  5:30 middle of most happy hours."}
{"text":"Customer service and attentiveness is OK.  The beer selection is great, the food is OK."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to hang out and catch up.  They have been here a lot, since it is handy and kid-friendly.  Seriously, reading the menu I thought it was just for kids.  Chicken wings, of course, and chicken in various other guises.  Burgers and sandwiches, etc.  The adults can have a drink, there's music and TV plus popcorn and games for distractions, and you're set.  It is loud, but not crazy.  Service was very good.  Overall it's a bit like Roosters or Applebee's.  The wings were fine, though not great: meaty but small.  Plenty of interesting sauces.  We had the seasonal bourbon (sweet, tangy, very good;) spicy garlic (not super hot, plenty of garlic, perhaps my favorite;)  spicy sesame (just a little heat, plus sweetness;) and goldfinger (sweet and tangy, pretty good.)   Upcharges for celery (4 measly pieces) and dressing (generic tub.)  Seriously, why do these places charge extra for that?  And if you're going to, at least make it worth it.  I had wings the other day and had to add-on, but I got 10 fresh big pieces of celery, plus a container of very good dressing.  /Rant.   It's a little expensive; we paid $60-plus for three adults and a kid, and we were really just snacking while we talked, not eating a full meal.  Still, it was a fun place to hang out and the food is good enough."}
{"text":"This place was packed - after about a 20 minute wait my buddy and I ordered the wings, sat out on the patio, and life was good.  Then the meal came.    I got a steak and cheese wrap, and frankly it was dry and uninspiring.  I also got the cheese fries, which were a little bit underdone and DROWNED in cheese and bacon bits.  Now, I like cheese fries, but these were a little too much.    I think this is a better apps & beers-type of place."}
{"text":"I cannot suggest going out of your way to hang here, but if you are nearby and want to throw back a few and eat some salty/fatty treats, you can't really do any better.  The bar area is small, but is covered with TV's, so if you are into sports you will be in good shape (as far as television coverage is concerned, anyway). They have a lot of beer, but if you are in a place like this it is best to stick to the specials. Free popcorn and pretty good BBQ sauce...not a terrible place by any stretch. The burgers ain't half bad, either. Overall its a slightly above-average (in the national sense) sports bar/restaurant. Expect more at your own peril."}
{"text":"Not the best WInking Lizard in the area, and not the best bar on the street, but it is serviceable I suppose.  My visit coincided with \"game day\" at The Jake, and the place was PACKED. We came in the \"back door\", and despite the crowd we were seated quickly by one of the servers(?). Within seconds the host(?) came by and angrily told us that \"you don't seat yourselves here guys...wait for one of us to do it for you\". Uh, we did. Douche. He just stomped away, never to be seen again, so...oh well.  Despite the buzzing crowd the service was actually pretty good, and large mugs of middling beer (at a cheap price) were procured quickly. Food was typical sports bar fare...chicken sandwiches, toss-in fries, coleslaw, blah blah blah.  It can work if you are with a group of people that don't like leaving any sort of comfort zone, and you sorta need to shoot for the middle so as not to scare anyone. The Boneyard down the street is a way better option for drinking, and I'm sure you can get better food somewhere too. It is...what it is."}
{"text":"I came here because I was staying at a hotel a few blocks away and I wanted to try something different besides the Buffalo Wild Wings I've eaten at numerous times all over the USA which is almost right next door (another restaurant sits between them). I did not realize it was happy hour from 3pm - 7pm which was great to me on a Monday afternoon - score!!! AND I forgot to mention that they also have $0.55 cent wings on Monday and Tuesdays -- woot woot!!  It took me forever to order because I was starving, but I ended up ordering 5 pieces of the Honey wings as an appetizer and the Steak Quesadilla. They wings were good, tasty, but my quesadilla was the bomb! It was o  the Seasonal Special part of the menu, and I hope they do bring it back one day because it was scrumptious (menu said the special ran from mid Nov to mid Jan - yes, I forgot the exact dates, sorry!!) I am so glad I came here for dinner! I shall return one day when I am in town again :)"}
{"text":"Nice selection of Beers and complete Menu. Had a BIG Salad! Eat at the bar and free popcorn. Neat place!"}
{"text":"3.5  stars  On my visit to Cleveland, there really wasn't a whole lot of happening nightlife, but we decided to head to the winking lizard to watch the Virginia Tech/Alabama game.   I didn't have high hopes for this chain, but the fact it had TVs and got the game, was good enough for me.  we started at the bar as we waited for a table and i was completely overwhelmed with the beer choices... wow.  I couldn't decide what i wanted cause everything looked so good.  I eventually got an octoberfest, that ws GIGNATIC.    And not ridiculously expensive... i love the midwest!  When we got a table, we opted to start with some appetizers, since we would be there for the long haul.  Jeff and I got the deep fried ravioli, which was good.. not fantastic but good.  I got the taco salad for dinner, which was gigantic and full of chili and other yumminess.  It was very good and very filling!  I had a really hard time chosing because i wanted at least 1/3 of the menu.  They have so many good looking things... bring a group and make sure to share!  Our waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.  They easily switched on the game for us and let us hang out and watch for as long as they wanted.  Plus they didn't seem to mind little haf on the table!  Overall i would say it was not the best food i've ever eaten, but definitely worth the cost :) If i'm ever looking to watch a game in cleveland, the winking lizard is where i will be"}
{"text":"Today my wife and I planned on eating at this location and discovered it's been closed permanently!   I guess it's over for the location in rocky river!"}
{"text":"Went in here on Memorial day, as a lot of other things were closed. To be honest, we weren't expectimg much..... Damn, I've never been happier to be wrong! Everything was incredible, and the portions were generous. The prefered fries were a gastronomic symphony.. and my daughter loved the grilled cheese. Great service, too, even on a game day.  Would stretch my gut again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Winking Lizard Coventry = Good Times. Period.  Started hanging here in 1999 but had to stop when I moved outta Cleveland Heights in 2003. I've been to a many Winking Lizards, and I'll say this has to be the best. The building is awesome, the multiple rooms are fantastic. Well, I do really like their newer Lakewood restaurant too. Bar is huge. That'll be another review...  Hard to make comparisons on food though as they are all the same, but there is nothing like the Caribbean Spice out there anywhere else. I'll tell you what, San Francisco does not have a single fab wing joint like the Winking Lizard (or BW3 for that matter), and every time I return to Cleveland, I eat here almost daily. Obsessive? Yep. Compulsive? A little bit. But anywhere that has a beer menu like the Winking Lizard deserves a special place in any beer lover's heart. Oh yeah, wings too.  And I believe the WL is the largest chain importer of Labatts Blue. I'll tell you what. Once you move south (Tucson) or west (San Francisco), it becomes almost impossible to find Canadian beers. If that even means anything.   In short. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The Leaping Lizard (as my grandpa calls it) is tucked away in the Rockside shopping plaza. Rachel did a great job of summing up the service at our 2nd yelp meetup last December. There's plenty of TVs here, tuned to multiple sports channels for multiple game watching. They have one of the largest beer selections in the area - 90 bottles [micros and domestics] from the USA, Ireland, England, Poland, Mexico, and more, about a dozen of them are on draft a time, all clearly laid out on their beer menu. When I went to the yelp meetup last December, they were out of my first 3 choices.. :/  The beers were Reasonably priced [$3.75 for a bottle of newcastle]. I went back last weekend with my family and the service and experience was fine. The half rack of st. louis ribs were cooked so that they didn't fall off the bone while they were cooking but easily off as you ate them.  If you're in the area at one of the hotels, this is probably one of the better places, especially if you're looking for a large beer selection; a very high 3 stars.   FYI: There's also skee ball and free popcorn."}
{"text":"Good wings at this Cleveland local chain."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard is a venerable Cleveland institution, at this point in my lifetime. I recognize that many locals still remember the opening of the Coventry/Downtown establishments, and still view them as the upstart \"new pub on the block.\" I remember the WL Lakewood opening through the same lens, but still find myself appreciating it every time I visit.  WL is not groundbreaking or novel in almost any perspective. (That being said, having an old school bowling alley in your basement grants nominal rockstar status, which is why I'll be installing one in my house someday) The food is ostensibly diverse, if diversity is served by offering a horde of tavern style food. (Wings, quesidillas, burgers, etc) They have an enormous popcorn machine outside of the main tavern area, which serves to slake the appetites of the marauding drunk sports fans until the food shows up. The beer selection here is liberally priced and offers a wealth of choices, many of which are unexpectedly good imports.  There's lots to do for fun in this spot, from skeeball to pool and basketball machines, as well as dozens of large screens featuring the game du jour. That being said, the crown jewel of this spot is the service; I've been here over a half dozen times and have always been, even at the busiest of times, served promptly and courteously. The bartenders (usually all attractive women) are funny and personable, and the servers are great with everyone. (including your screaming children, which is why I'm always glad when friends with kids want to come here)  Great spot, never disappoints."}
{"text":"Fun place! Great beer, you can do the \"tour\", good food - I had the haddock dinner, excellent service, Ash was a delight."}
{"text":"Wings specials on Mon and Tues make this place worth a visit. Besides their wings, I haven't found any other good items from their menu. Love the soda options. The servers can be rude sometimes."}
{"text":"Stopped in when I was traveling through town. Was a great little place for a few drinks and a quick bite to eat.... I have to say the funnel cake desert was my favorite with the margaritas a close second. Bartender was great about splitting tabs and quick with refills---My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. It occupies the entire bottom floor of a downtown building.  It has a large main bar near the entrance, but a really nice small more private bar in the back.  I sat at the back bar.  My bartender was a nice girl named Bridgette.  She got me a drink immediately and a menu.  I asked her what was good; so she pointed me to the Baja Tacos.  They arrived quick and tasted really good.  The drink was fine, nothing special.  The only reason I am not giving the place five stars was the ambiance of the place.  The lady stocking lamps at the bar were straight out of A Christmas Story, and a little disconcerting.  Also, I was close to the servers station and had to listen to a VERY loud server.  Bridgette did a great job and even took the time to make me feel welcome.  I'd come back if I am in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"After a visit to the Rock & Roll museum, and wandering around searching in vain for an open eating establishment, it was such a relief to find this place. They have a nice big menu so we were both able to quickly find something to hit the spot, and the food came out quickly. Not the greatest food I've ever had, but decent bar & grill fare. The servers were very nice, and I got a little overwhelmed with all of the tvs all showing different games, though if I was more into sports I might have appreciated it more."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Winking Lizard to grab a quick bite to eat; and we were thoroughly unimpressed.  It is basically a sports bar featuring burgers and fried food.  We didn't have to wait for a table and the service wasn't half-bad but the food was just not good.  Feeling adventurous I tried the burger with fried mac & cheese on top.  It was basically a grease ball on a bun.  I couldn't taste anything but grease.  They do feature over 50 varieties of beer so if you are looking for a place to watch the game and enjoy a beer it's good for that, but I wouldn't recommend the food."}
{"text":"First of all they have a great beer list. Secondly, a great variety of wings to choose from. I felt like some portions of the wings were a bit hard cooked. But, they were still good. What makes the wings are there fantastic sauces."}
{"text":"Didn't even get seated tonight. Guy (I think the manager) taking names tonight was rude and ignored customers. We walked out! This location is going down the tubes in terms of service."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, amazing prices.  Next time I'm in town, I'm there."}
{"text":"Beer, beer, bEEr, BeEr, BEER!  Best Lizard location in Cleveland - one of the best bartops in Cleveland too.    I don't think i've ever had a bad time here - in fact, I may have had a little too much fun here!"}
{"text":"I went here before a Brown's preseason game and it was PACKED. I got my name in to the hotestess, who you could tell were very overwhelmed and stressing out. When I asked how long it would be, I got a very rude, \"I have no idea.\" I guess you can expect that when you hire very young people to work at very busy time. We were able to grab a seat at the bar (2) by squeezing through people while waiting for a table and the rest of our party to arrive. There was an awesome beer selection, and I was able to try some new beer.  We ordered the beer cheese dip while we were at the bar waiting, and it was fantastic!! The bread that came with it was so good as well--everyone from our party that tried it loved it. If you're gonna do an appetizer, get that one. For an entree, I got the Cleveland Polish Boy, and I cannot believe how much food came with it. The Polish boy was absolutely huge, and it came with a ton of coleslaw, which I don't like anyway but it looked fresh. Came with fries, which were very good also.  We did end up getting a table, and it didn't really take that long. Aside from the hostesses not being the best, our waiter was outstanding. He was VERY nice, patient, and did not leave us for long periods of time without checking on us, despite how busy it was. I would definitely go back. I think it's a great plavce to go to before, and I'm sure after, sports games."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice so far, but when I have to go out to this location, I cringe...because of all the fruit flies!! They are EVERYWHERE!! The first time I was here, I basically spent the whole time waving them away from my food. They were even all over the girls bathroom! The second time I was there, I sat at the bar (the first time was in the back dining room), and they were still flying all over the place.  I made a comment to my friend about it, and the bartender/guy that was dressed like a manager heard me and jumped in, saying they clean so much and put bleach everywhere and they can't get rid of them no matter what.  He insisted it was literally impossible, they couldn't do anything about it. I wanted to ask him if he had ever heard of John Taffer/seen the show Bar Rescue, because I was sure there was a way to get rid of them---for example, why was none of the fruit covered? It was all sitting in the open by where all the waitresses picked up bar drinks.  Speaking of the waitresses, if you sit at the bear area, you will hear all their conversations about personal things, whether you like to or not. For example, one of their buddies, may be a fellow co-worker who gets drunk and then goes on about his escapades.  That was kind of annoying...  Their onion rings were really good.  Had their boneless wings, standard like all other places, and once I did get the western burger, or it was called something along those lines, and it actually was pretty fabulous...just had to watch no fruit flies came on it.  BTW, parking sucks here on a Friday or Saturday night....might be able to grab a spot in the back, but there are towing signs EVERYWHERE so be careful."}
{"text":"Good beer selection (as you'd expect from this local chain); mediocre food (it used to be better and one of my go-to sources for a quick burger on the East side -- something's changed, and not for the better); so-so service. It's not the worst you could do, but it's also not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"My family and I ate an early dinner here before the Indians game. The food was pretty good! Nothing that really sets it apart, but it was decent food! I love my honey garlic boneless wings! The Mac and cheese bites were good, but I've had better. Our waitress was very nice, but they were playing AWFUL 90's heavy metal. The music was too loud for there being hardly anyone in the restaurant. It was very disrupting and hard to carry on a conversation with the people at my table. It was an okay experience, but I love other winking lizards so I would most likely give it another chance!"}
{"text":"I love the Winking Lizard. They sponsor my kickball team, after all! I would consider myself a regular here as we visit every Thursday either before or after a kickball game. I have always been a fan of the food, but the main draw is their amazingly huge selection of beers. Food wise, my favorite item by far is the turkey burger, which is on special, along with all burgers, on Thursday nights for $6.99. I usually get it with a side of mac and cheese, which is also good.       Now to the alcohol. They have hundreds of options and definitely have whatever it is you're looking for (whether that be an IPA or even a banana bread beer). Last year, I participated in the tour of beers and let me tell you, the Lizard sure knows how to throw a party! When you finish, you and a guest (for 20-25$ a head) get to go to the finisher party where they have all you can eat and all you can drink buffets as well as plenty of entertainment. While it was fun, it was definitely an expensive year as you have to drink 100 beers on the tour at about 4-6$ a pop.       While I can always rave about the food and drinks, this location seems to be lacking the the service department. I will say, the bartenders have always been great a friendly, but my issues seem to lie mostly with the hosting staff. Our team comes in almost every Thursday with anywhere from about 8-20 people. We have been doing this for the last three years, and they still will not let us make a reservation or call ahead. Every time we walk in with  a huge group, they seemed surprised. However, we have always been seated promptly.       The past couple of times we've been there, however, the hostess has been extremely rude. I came in this past Thursday and stated that we had 17 people, but were more than willing to split up if need be. The girl sighed, rolled her eyes, mumbled \"you guys are killing me\" and stormed into the dining room (I assume to find us tables). When she returned, she continued to talk to us in a rude way, so we ended up leaving instead of giving them out hundreds of dollars in business and tips. I'm very disappointed in my past few experiences here and I'm hoping that the hosting staff will change their attitudes. Other than this issue, the Lizard is a great place to eat and drink and I will always recommend it."}
{"text":"Your average Winking Lizard, nothing really stands out although they do have a nice patio. Service is average as is the food and drinks. Could use better happy hour specials. Would come back for a quick drink if in the area."}
{"text":"Great for drinking and watching games but take a pass on the food.  Nothing is fresh, everything looks heated-from-frozen.  With so many draught options, I wonder how old some of those keg taps are."}
{"text":"Lauren is an amazing waitress (ask for her if you can) and the food was on point! Amazing prices and quality for downtown Cleveland. Highly recommend if you want something good."}
{"text":"I love their wings. I love the selection of beer. Beware of messing with the jukebox after too many brews. I think I pumped $10 in there last time!"}
{"text":"I love this place for 5 different reasons: 1) they have the best wings 2) they have a HUGE selection of drinks (even all the flavors of coke) 3) they have enough TVs so you can watch all the sports you want 4) FREE POPCORN (good popcorn) 5) THEY HAVE A FREAKING LIZARD!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out for the first time today. We wanted to sit on the patio, which is adorable by the way, and the employees at the front were nice. But once we were seated, we weren't greeted for 15 minutes with servers walking right by us multiple times and avoiding eye contact with us. We eventually decided to get up from the table and move to the bar where we got immediate service. It just ticked us off that our first time here we had to wait that long when it wasn't that busy and there was clearly a server in our section. Very rude. Oh well, the wings were great and the drinks too. This place just needs to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Service is always good at both locations. I've always had a good time, gets crowded but I don't mind it. Good beer selection and they make their drinks well. Not a fan of the margaritas here however they taste too syrupy. Spinach artichoke dip is a must it's so good. In conclusion this is my go to watering hole when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place used to awesome until it turned from a cool bar to a \"family\" place.  Even their menu shifted.  It's all about churning the bucks here-no sweet, fun bar anymore.  Now it's like TGIFriday's.  Nothing like seeing tables full of misbehaving kids in a bar that's blasting NSFW Muzak while bar patrons yell obscenities at their favorite sports games.   Suggestions:  NO KIDS (that's under 18), period, after 5pm.  With Mommy and Daddy or not.   I go to a bar to get away from kids, not to chill with them. And Lizard, get the retro menu back."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is a standard for our family. Four stars for the draft beer selection, but just want to make sure all know that the food is pretty typical sport bar fare.  I do appreciate that you can sub fries for grilled veggies, rice pilaf, steamed broccoli, Mac n cheese at no extra cost.  My boys always enjoy visiting the lizard and they are sports fans, so the numerous tv's ensure something of interest will be on.  Today's beer selection was the November handle - sample of Revolution Fistmas, Founders Breakfast Stout, N'Ice Chouffe and Sierra Nevada Celebration. Great group!"}
{"text":"I'm going to sound like a broken record with regards to Murray's review so I'll try to comment on what makes this location a 4 star Cleveland area chain.  First off, look at your options.  Sometimes I have no idea whats going to be open certain months, seasons, times, days, etc. etc., not to mention the restaurant turnover downtown is pretty high.   I always know that WL is open and that parking ramps and street (if you are lucky) spots are available.  This is ideal when meeting others because its literally in an area I can only describe as \"can't miss\", lots of tables / bar stools, diverse menu, and a decent kids menu.    Locations around WL that I compare to that are within the same wavelength would be Panini's, Cleats, and Harry Buffalo, maybe throw in Flannery's but maybe not for this comparison.  The Lizard is always a kid favorite and I don't mind it either, cause usually I just go for the wings.   I like the menu at the Buff but the servers are sub par.  Cleat's usually have good wings but this location isn't my favorite and it was dimly lit / gloomy last time I was in there.  Ahhhh....the wings at Winking Lizard.  I've never had a bad wing here.  I typically go for the spicy garlic variety but recently tried a mustard based flavor that was surprisingly mild, with just a hint of mustard, would get another round in an instant.  Maybe ask the server if you can get extra sauce, mine really could have used a little more to dip my wings in or to pour a tasty helping over the top.  So I guess this is a guys 'Wings and Beer' kind of review but it is what it is and I'll be back to WL in the near future, especially if its 20 degrees out and I'm hitting the Q for a game / concert."}
{"text":"Stopped into Winking Lizard on Saturday night for wings, spinach dip, a spicy chicken wrap, and beers.  The wings were good, not over cooked, but I could have used a little more sauce.  The Spinach dip was ordered because the wrap wasn't really good.  It was poorly made and blah!  The dip on the other hand was much better.  The place was really busy with small families, couples, and older folks.  The small game room was flooded with kids, unfortunately no one was using the skee ball, what is wrong with kids these days and their digital hand helds, old school is where its at!!   I'd go back, its very convenient, lots of parking, and the food is usually better then the experience we had on Saturday night.  Go out for a beer and grab yourself  a basket of popcorn."}
{"text":"Don't go. No attention to bar dining patrons.  Had to ask for menu, food, and drinks. Horrible"}
{"text":"In general I'd give the Lizard 4 stars. But this location, I'm being generous with a 3. Really good wings, of course, with lots of tasty sauces. That's about it. Everything else I've had has been decent but not outstanding and a bit on the overpriced side. The Lizard has a huge menu so there's pretty much something for everyone. A good place to go if you have a big group with varied tastes.   This location gets 2.5 - 3 stars because they have this completely asinine rule where they card you just to walk into the place anytime after 5pm. Now, I get it, they are trying to keep the riff-raff from the Grog Shop out of their establishment. But come on. I'm in my sweatpants, clearly am over 21 and just want some dinner. Since I just woke up from my nap, and Sean drove me here, I don't have my ID. I'm not about to start anything, just let me in and serve me some wings.   A completely stupid rule, IMO. Here's an idea, if someone is causing problems - kick them out! And card them for drinks! But leave the rest of us alone. If you are more responsible than me and always have your ID, you'll be fine. Otherwise, go down to Panini's."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Lizard location in town. The building used to be the old Elks lodge and still has just enough clues to the building's former life.   There is an honest-to-God bowling alley in the basement  with at least 6 lanes and a separate bar. You can rent this out for events - a really nice little option for parties that can hold a lot of people. Separate bathrooms downstairs too which is a plus.   On the main level there are a couple different seating areas with TVs and also a nice patio out front for the summer months.   The bar area, though is the real jewel here. The bar is HUGE HUGE HUGE. The old gymnasium/auditorium of the Elks lodge is now the bar of the Winking Lizard. Tons of seating, really long bar itself and a separate elevated area with some arcade games/skee-ball which can also be rented out for an event. The first time you see this bar area, your jaw will drop. It's just so cavernous yet somehow not as loud as you would expect.  The food is average as with all the Lizards in my opinion and the service is ok but often slow in the big bar area if you're sitting at a table. Also beware of the stupid-ass rule that you have to get carded to enter the place after 5 pm. This is a Lizard-wide policy which defies logic, but it is what it is I suppose.   Overall, a nice place to grab some wings and beers and watch a game or two."}
{"text":"The draft beers are awesome. I loved the Hefeweizen Market Garden (607) the best.   The wings or the burgers are great."}
{"text":"Order wings and you're in good shape. Sauces are delish, as are boneless wings.  Sandwiches are subpar.  Reuben needed more sauerkraut, more sauce, and the muffuletta was not so muffuletta-ish.  More like an Italian sub on a round bun with olives added. The exception is the pulled pork. Super yum."}
{"text":"Always friendly and helpful even when bombarded after the browns game gets out on a Sunday. Food is good as well! Buffalo Chicken Salad, caribbean wings and the Clevelander specialty sandwich are quite tasty! Each night there is a different menu item with a special Mon $2 off wings and Tue $2 off all burgers! Cant beat it!"}
{"text":"We came here because it was near our hotel.  As others have said, it is hard to locate,    Tip: get here by 5:00pm on Saturday if you want a table without having to wait.   Since the restaurant has only been open 2 weeks from the time of our visit, I am cutting the restaurant some slack from having stars deducted.  I know it takes some time to get things running smoothly.  There is a popcorn machine near the front door where customers can come and fill up a brown paper bag of popcorn and take it to their table.  The host should mention this to every table that they seat.  We didn't know about until we saw another customer go get his brown paper bag.  Great menu.  There were several entrees that I wanted to try.  I ended up getting the bourbon steak salad.  It is chopped lettuce, canned peach slices, candied pecans, onion and blue cheese sprinkles, topped with bourbon steak pieces and served with a bourbon salad dressing. I enjoyed it.  Son and husband loved the hamburger, chicken fingers and side salad.  As we were leaving at 6pm, there was quite a line of people waiting.  I will return to this Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"This review is for my experience in the restaurant's party room.  We reserved the room ($100) for a party of 40 people on a Friday evening. As an out of towner, I had never been to this restaurant so I didn't know what to expect.  All aspects of our party went very, very well.  We arrived an hour early to set up a few extra decorations.  The room was all set up for us, including the table for the buffet and the table for the gifts and cake.  We were assigned two servers and they were excellent the entire evening.  We had a buffet of appetizers and all of them were delicious. We had pizza, chicken tenders, fried mozzarella triangles, barbeque wings, buffalo wings, french fries, cheeseburger sliders and pulled pork sliders and a vegetable tray.  I recommend this restaurant for a small private party."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, the sauce on the beef and the chicken takes it to another level.  Their fries are pretty good also.  The atmosphere is great with good music and sports screens all over near the bar."}
{"text":"After arriving and being seated in my party of four around 10:30 p.m., we had to wait close to an hour just to get an appetizer, which we never did receive! Food was pretty good, but the speed of service and attentiveness was just terrible. They weren't even THAT busy. It's not like there was a Tribe or Cavs or Browns game that night, just the Night Nation Run race. If it were up to me, I would have walked out. If it's a choice between this location and the one at 1301 East 9th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, go to the one on East 9th, which is nicer, anyway."}
{"text":"Was in Ohio for training, and wasn't real familiar with the area. It was the weekend and didn't want to stay in the hotel, me a coworker decided to go out for drinks and appetizers. When we arrived it wasn't crowded and we were able to find seats at the bar. We were greeted and given menus, everything seemed nice. After we ordered our food and drinks the service went downhill from there. I ordered a glass of water with lemon and never received it, our server walked past us several times and didn't even check to see if we needed anything. But the people who were sitting around us were being checked on; given water when they asked for it and even got there check in a timely manner. At that point I was annoyed and just ready to go, so I asked for our check and we didn't receive it for another 20 minutes which didn't make the situation better. I signed for the check even left a tip, (I dont know why I did maybe I was feeling nice), usually I wouldn't if the service was bad.  I travel back and forth to Ohio for work purposes, and have business meetings and events at different restaurant locations. Based on this experience I will not be going back to The Winking Lizard Tavern, and definitely will not recommend it to any of my co workers."}
{"text":"My co-worker picked this place, probably because he's a bit of a bro and he has kids. Both categories are well accommodated here for sure.   There are big TV's for sports ball viewing. There are wings and onion rings without limit. Beers are served in some of the largest glasses I've seen outside of traditional German Oktoberfest celebrations.   For the kids, there are arcade type games that eat endless quarters and deliver \"prizes\". Chicken fingers and pizza are readily available. There is an actual live lizard as well (named Pickles!) so the Winking Lizard delivers what it promises in the reptilian department.   I had a turkey melt. It was fine. You can get broccoli instead of fries, and our server was nice. Totally a-ok."}
{"text":"Went to the winking lizard in Mayfield Hts. Sat at the bar with my mother, SLOW service, bar tenders were pretty and pretty slow. Way too busy b.s.ing about their lives.  Ask for 1 tv to be turn to the news, after 45 minutes and a bunch or \"yes sir, no prblom sir,\" never changed the channel.  NEVER going back, damn shame, their bar near summit mall, very nice.  LAZY PEOPLE, BE advised"}

{"text":"Great food, cool little bar with lots of seating.¬† I can't even fathom how crazy it must get when there are games in town.¬† I came in on a Tuesday night and the girl working the bar was awesome.¬† She had a great attitude, worked hard, and had a good sense of humor.¬† The boneless wings were good and their beer prices weren't bad with a few really good specials.¬† I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The Worst place I have been in Lakewood the service honestly was so slow it took the server 20 mins to get my drink! The food is ok but I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm all around a total Winking Lizard fan. My only problem is that I wished I lived closer to one so I could join the beer club. We came here before going to an Indians game on a Tuesday. It worked out perfectly that Monday and Tuesday are wing nights, so we got in and out quickly for under $20! Also, the lizards name was CleOh, clever."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for a drink on an overnight stay in Cleveland.  Great selection of local brews, friendly knowledgeable staff.  Food was decent.  Caught game 7 of Cavs - Celts.  Nice crowd for that.  Overall a nice, friendly neighborhood vibe.  Was a bit warm (no A/C on weekend?), but decent breeze from keeping the doors open and plenty of room, and TVs, on the patio as well."}
{"text":"Great full bar, and great draft options. The Greek salad with grilled chicken left much to be desired. It was very bland, the dressing didn't have much flavor, and over all was mediocre."}
{"text":"A lot of my posts are of 5 star experiences but it's because I only write about the greats, or my peeps and I made the experience regardless. This place is classic. If I'm not at the game itself, or at home watching it on TV, this is where I'd be every Sunday. Plenty of screens for all the games at once without having to kink your neck to watch. Every flavor of wings a mafucka' would want. Sometimes I get anxious worried about whether I'll get enough different types of wings or if I'll need to get something in addition to wings. At this place I'm calm and able to eat just wings and leave satisfied. Also they have lil' popcorn bags you can take with you on the trip home. Genius. More like winking iguana!"}
{"text":"Went to both the Galleria and Gateway locations while on a road trip with friends. One of the most impressive beer selections I have seen. The wings classic and boneless were very good. We had the Cajun and bourbon sauce. Pfred fries were good. Burger was juicy and teriyaki chicken very good. At Gateway our waiter Big Mike bit of a smart ass which was perfect for the vibe. Funny guy and a good waiter."}
{"text":"Whats Good: The wings, there is a reason this place is known for it's wings. They have a bunch of flavors, my favorite is the golden garlic sauce, it tastes amazing. Also, their pizza is pretty good as well.  Whats Bad: Expensive drinks. For example when I was there I was drinking vodka shots of Grey Goose, and it tasted like Smirnoff or Absolute and was quite expensive and the pours were not all that great.  Bottom Line: Go there for food, then go elsewhere if you want to drink."}
{"text":"I would definitely stick with bar/comfort foods.  The wings are some of the best I have ever tasted.  The house salad is plenty big and balances out your wings.  Dinner entrees I would skip.  They do not do steak dinners well at all for instance.  I sometimes wonder if they are just reheating their dinner fare in a mircrowave.  Love their beer selection.  They usually have a 32oz draft special so ask what that is.  Service is OK but at times it takes a LONG time to get food to the table!"}
{"text":"We visited this winking lizard to have drinks and dinner before going to a late show at the grog shop.  Drinks- We split a reasonably priced pitcher of seasonal pumpkin beer ($15.75) followed by waitress recommend local ipa and blueberry beers.  Food - I had a classic American cheeseburger with steak fries. It was cooked to order and had great flavor. My husband was in love with the Cajun style burger (Bo mans bacon cheeseburger) with added jalape√±os and the shells and cheese side. Their table bbq sauce was pretty tasty too.  Service - All in all, we must have visited on one of their \"on\" nights because everything about our experience that night was great. Our waitress kept our waters filled, beers fresh, ensured our food was good, and took the time to chat with us. Would love for this place to be local to us in Michigan."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Went here before a cavs game with my family from out of town, put our name in and got a table fairly quickly. The bartender seemed less than helpful when we were ordering drinks, as if we should have known what the beers and specials were at the time. The table service was pretty average. The food was also average. Masked by a lot of options to choose from, the boneless wings (BBQ) were more of a not so original taste. The rest of the table was pleased with their sandwich orders, but nothing we couldn't find elsewhere for a quieter and more friendly environment. I wouldn't say I would be jumping up and down to go back, unless the staff miraculously became interested in the tables and making sure everything is good (we had to ask for bleu cheese 3 Times), and the music got turned down a little so i could hear myself think. It doesn't need to be so loud at 5PM, but i get it- bar food bar atmosphere. The location is convenient which Is a positive, just don't think this place will get our business again."}
{"text":"Typical bar fare.  Food was very good - staff was friendly on all fronts.  Knowledgable about different kinds of beer. Huge selection of beers.  I liked everything about this place for what my expectations were.  Had chicken club & also the nachos. Would eat here again. PUMKING ON TAP! :-)"}
{"text":"Good quick service, low prices, plentiful beer.  This is the Lizard, folks.  If you don't know it, you don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Nice bar. Very casual & laid back. Me & my husband came here to grab a drink after work & it was exceptional. Kitchen closes before bar"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in the area and her daughters told me about this place.  Her youngest challenged me to eat their hottest which is called Magnum.  But when we got there we found that they have a new hottest on the menu with scorpion peppers (hotter than a ghost pepper).  I accepted the challenge.  I asked the waitress though if it was dry or sauce and she said it was not dry.  However, when I got them they definitely were dry.  It was almost hard for me to eat them not because of the heat (and yes they are spicy but I can handle that) but just how dry the wings were.  I also ordered 5 pieces of the spicy BBQ ones which had better with more sauce and not dry but not very spicy.  The beer selection is crazy big and if it had been warmer it would have been nice to sit outside.  Overall, I felt out waitress wasn't very attentive, some wings were better than others and the beer was delicious."}
{"text":"The reviews on the wings are spot on. Try the Thai/Chili and Goldfinger sauces...damn fine!"}
{"text":"5 stars for beer selection, the world tour, and the year end world tour party. Wl is perfect place to go to meet friends,have some good drinks, watch the game on one of like 30 tv's, and have some typical bar fare.  Each month they change out a seasonal food and beer menu too, normally everything is good. I saw some posts about service, but have never experienced poor service. Granted, wheni its packed its a litle slower, but i expect that."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is the best place to go in town if you want to browse a menu of over 100 beers, both bottles and on tap. The food selection is great as well and everything is tasty. I'm a fan of the jerk chicken sandwich and their boneless wings! It's strange to have two locations within a mile of each other, but this location started as a Wink's and specialized in Ohio beer and bourbons. It transitioned into a normal Winking Lizard tavern a few years ago. The location up the street is right next to Progressive Field. This place is hopping during the workweek lunch hours between 11 and 1. I used to work across the street and came here once a week for some suds and a burger. Having this place in the business district is a huge plus to the area. Service is always great!"}
{"text":"This place sucks we waited for over thirty minutes and they seated two groups ahead of us what a piece of shit place don't go here they are shitty to customers and the hostess had no excuse. Can't comment on the food because they did not serve us but I can only Imagine it is shitty too. Don't go here. I would have given them no stars but yelp will not allow you to do that, screw the winking lizard"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a bus and had 45 minutes to kill after an Indians day game. Since everyone who stayed for the last out showed up at the same time, the place got hit hard all at once...just like every other game.  And this downtown lizard went into the lousy service panic mode. They seat you right away and then ignore you for ten minutes while three or four manager-looking guys pace the floor with their headsets, avoiding eye contact. They know from experience that if they look at a customer during this delay someone will ask them for a beer and God forbid they have to do something. We waited awhile, chugged a beer in a keep-the-glass special (Dogfish Punkin Ale - 7.7% abv) and raced out to catch the bus. If anyone had hustled -even just a little bit- we could have gotten some food too.  The beer was good."}
{"text":"Went here for a recent work event, where we rented out the downstairs and had an open bar. Ok. Win. Definitely a great place for a casual work event, and a very cool location overall.  Pros: - The upstairs is gorgeous. It used to be a indoor tennis hall, apparently, but was built back where architecture mattered, and it shows in this building. It's beautiful. - The beer list. I was very impressed, and I'm kind of a beer fan. Lots of good local microbrews, a number of different rye beers on tap, and quite a few belgians/hard to find beers in the bottle. More importantly, everything was served in appropriate glassware, which surprised me in a place this large. Kudos to them for serving me an Orval in an Orval goblet.  - There's a 6-8 lane bowling alley in the basement! Never would have expected this. It was fun to bowl a few games while drinking some beers with colleagues.   Cons: - The food was typical bar food. Chicken fingers, greasy pub pizza, etc. I wouldn't likely go back to eat, but I'd certainly go to drink some beers.  Overall, a good bar, and a great beer bar. It was very crowded, so don't expect peace and quiet. The food docks it a star though. Not great."}
{"text":"I am turned off by this place because it is so dark and gloomy. There are not many windows in the dining area and the lights are so low. It dampens your mood.  The food was just ok. Ordered extra crispy wings and they were not extra crispy. Ribs were average.  The one in Independence is much better!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has become one of my favorite wind down places. They are one of the only places that know how to fry wings \"crispy\" like I like them and their sauces are divine.  Once in awhile, the bartenders are snappy as they dont handle stress well (which is often because its usually crowded). I have bonded with most of them but for those who havent, it may take a little time to warm up to them.  Food is really good and they always have nice draft specials. In the summer, you will LOVE the new deck.  Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not prepared at all for a show right around the corner @ Public Hall tonight. No manager in sight! Very poor planning. Been waiting 25 mins so far just to get a drink at the bar..."}
{"text":"This is my local Lizard & I love how big & spacious it is on the inside. I believe the building is an old-time club of some sort. In the basement is Lizardville with an endless selection of all kinds of craft brews, bourbons, & cigars which is unique to certain locations.   Great spot for catching the big game, but better for the cold weather because there really aren't many windows in the main bar. This is more of a place to hunker in and catch the Cavs games with all the locals."}
{"text":"Chemistry - what can I say except the formula works.  We've been coming here so long, that it's more of a reunion and an extension of eating in than dining out.  This is the corporate equivalent of Cheers, where everybody knows your name.  The food is good, the portion sizes are decent, the beer selection is first rate.  Special orders won't upset them (hold this, add that..).  Sure, we've had a bad meal or two, but going anywhere more than a thousand times that's going to happen occasionally.  We look forward to the specials, muffaletta in February, St. Patrick's corned beef on rye pizza in March, clam bake in fall, etc., etc., etc.  We've only stopped doing the beer tours and keep-the-glass specials because we had more inventory than we knew what to do with.  The patio is fun in all seasons, the bar area is loaded with TV's, the main dining room is family friendly, including kids of all ages.  We've had a family party in the back and it was awesome.  On peak nights the parking lot can get full and wait times can get long, but now you know why."}
{"text":"Today was our first time here at the winking lizard. I had the boneless wings and my husband has traditional, both were severely over cooked. We also had the fried pickles, they were ok, nothing to write home about. Service is pretty slow and our waitress was a little rude. Won't be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"This Winking Lizard really is great. I've spent many nights after work drinking and eating with friends and co-workers and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly employees.  The outdoor seating is just great. Perfect for game nights or just hanging out sitting by the fire. There is a cozy fireplace as well as a stage for bands to play. The bar outside is connected to the inside which gives you a connected feeling to the place.  The food has ALWAYS been awesome here. I always get a wedge salad, no blue cheese, ranch on the side. They never get it wrong. My boyfriend always gets the Reuben or the steak sandwich and he always enjoys them!   The employees are phenomenal. They get to know you over time and always remember what we like. We are going to miss the old manager, and hope the new management team is as good as the last!"}
{"text":"This place is one the more racist places I've been to in Lakewood every time I walk through the door before I make the the booth to be seated by a server I'm approached very rudely by someone and asked can I help you? Do you have I.D.? I've been here 3 times with my girlfriend who happens to be a white woman. When they see her they greet her as if she not with me and is very polite to her until the last visit where we both just felt unwelcome. Everyone other customers as just give us dirty looks the whole entire time we was there. We waited 10 mins for a server who ID us when you not allowed in without ID they check it at the door smh. We waited another 10 mins for our drinks.. Then she finally asked us was we ready to order after 25 mins. We placed our orders and after 45 mins it finally came out and of course the food was cold. The whole time our server walk back-and-forth and did not acknowledge his access do we want a refill or anything she literally ignored us and then had the nerve to bring us cold food.. I immediately ask for boxes and the check I will never ever go back to this place management sucks service sucks and is 2016 wake up people why does racism still exist this place is literally a joke."}
{"text":"Roti chicken needs to be on heat much longer. Not really Roti chicken, just a dead chicken w/BBQ sauce.  Beans and cole slaw were good."}
{"text":"New in town and stopped by here to get some food and watch a baseball game. Place was hopping but managed to get a seat at the bar. Really good selection of beers on tap with a good number of IPAs which is what I am always looking for. Service was somewhat hard to comeby but when it was there it was friendly. The wings are pretty solid and I like that they display the spiciness rating from most mild to hottest so you know what you are getting into. Had the sesame wings which basically tasted like general tso's chicken...in a good way.   Definitely plan on coming back for the beer and wings. Love a sports bar that has its craft beer game on."}
{"text":"Two years ago we did their World Tour of Beers. Recently it was their Tuesday night bowling league. Now matter what you are here for, the Winking Lizard had a lot to offer! A great menu, and and even greater variety of craft beers and drink options. Also their calendar of specials and happenings can be very helpful! I love trying the \"glass of the month\" beer, and taking the glass home. I have acquired a bunch of really cool beer glasses for my home collection that way. The staff and service are generally excellent. The only downside is that even though WL is a local chain, they have a bit of a corporate feel. (I also note that the bartenders use jiggers to measure out every liquor pour.) That being said for what it is, its a fabulous place! Also extra great for sports fans. Tons of big nice TVs. And best of all... wing night on Tuesdays!!! Don't miss out on trying that!"}
{"text":"Made reservation for 21 people.  Showed up for dinner and had split group and had 1/2 of group sitting at bartop facing window.  Could not accommodate group...never should have accepted reservation.  Manager was not helpful at all.  Ended up walking out before ordering. Corner Alley down the street was able to fit us in on the spot and provided great customer service."}
{"text":"New lizard is large and of course consistent. Great patio. Football on all tv's we usually hit a lizard every other week. This is our second time at this new one. Same menu same happy hours. Just great."}
{"text":"Always always consistent one of favorite go to places. Something for everyone especially if your a beer enthusiast. We hit this location about once a week. Indoor outdoor seating fire pit great food and drink. Good service not much more to I can say."}
{"text":"We come frequently for the wing/pizza nights. The wings are $2.75 for 5 bone in wings and I think $5 for a small cheese pizza (their pizzas are very yummy, I usually add a topping or two for $0.50 extra each). I like to get the glass of the month or the shot of the month, they're a pretty good deal considering it comes with the glass."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We come to winking lizard almost every month to get the glass of the month and wings. We called in earlier in the day to ask if they still had the glass of the month and scarf in stock and whoever answered the phone told us yes. When we came in, we checked again with the hostess and was again told a confident yes, they still had the glass of the month and scarf. As soon as we got to the bar, we tried to order the glass of the month and was told that they had been out for almost a week. I find it very unprofessional to lie to customers over the phone and in person. It would've been as easy as taking half a minute to check, and both times they neglected to check when we asked specifically.   I've been frequenting the Winking Lizard for almost two years at various locations- Coventry (since closed down) and two Cleveland downtown locations as well as this one. After one incidence when they ran out of glasses, for the past few months I've been calling in to check if the glass is available. Last month we had a similar experience- I called into multiple winking lizard locations to check if the glass of the month was still available. One of them told me they thought they had a couple left, so I asked them to check and they said they had run out. Another told me confidently that they did have glass in stock, and when I asked them to check again, they were unwilling but I insisted, and they found that they were completely out. When I called this location last month, they said they did have the glass available after i asked them specifically to check for me and I was able to get it. I figured with all the phone calls I've made asking for the glass and specifically requesting them to physically go check that servers/hostesses would've made it a point to check their facts rather than misinforming customers. Or ex-customers.  I found my experience here very disappointing. The food here is good enough for bar food, but honestly I can cook much better myself and again, the real reason I come here is to collect the glass, so it was a complete waste of my time to come in and be told that no, they actually ran out of glasses long ago."}
{"text":"Great place for their wing deal (55¬¢ each or 50¬¢ each boneless) and pizza deal (individual pizzas for $5~ish depending on toppings). Lots of different wing flavors, comparable to Buffalo wild wings' menu. There's a drink of the month every month, which comes with a glass you can keep! Very casual sports bar type atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is a large bar / restaurant. They even have bowling lanes downstairs!  Lunch was good with reasonable prices, a nice selection, lots of different brews, and good service. I ordered the Blue-Cheese-Mushroom-Burger and it was very good.  Nothing too amazing going on in here, but definitely a reliable lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite bar food in cleveland. Great wings and sauces, and a phenomenal brew selection. Highly recommend the Garlic Cajun sauce."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in all of Cleveland, simply wonderful. Great food and a wide beer selection, simply can't be beat. They have over 100 beers available and also specialize in making amazing wing sauces, its like buffalo wild wings 2.0."}
{"text":"So happy about this new location. Winking lizard is one of my fave places in cleveland. Phenomenal variety of wing sauces and great beer selection. My favorite sauce is probably cajun, but a lot depends on your heat preference. They also have some nice dry rubs. If you are looking for good wings/bar food and beer, this place can't be beat. In terms of this location, it alternates between extremely empty and incredibly packed. It's tucked away in an office park, so can be a little hard to find at first."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant for consistently really good American food - like burgers, chicken fingers, and chicken wings. They also have really good salads! Although they usually seem pretty busy, I have never waited longer than 15 minutes (even when they have estimated longer). The service is generally good, although some of the servers seem to be a little forgetful; they always make up for it though! Food always come pretty fast, too. All in all, you can't go wrong with this restaurant - and this location."}
{"text":"Oh, Winking Lizard. How do I best remember thee? I have been here more times than I can count, for all kinds of experiences.   And much like an old friend, man do I have some dirt on you!!! If you ever get married, I'm going to have to bite my tongue around your spouse.  What were you thinking? You attempted to complete the entire Beers Around the World Tour, in one night. You began to rally the bar to assist you in drinking the necessary 100 beers. We finally had to get you home when you started shouting \"Forza Azzuri\" at a bunch of Italian frat guys, while throwing popcorn in their beers.    In all honesty, I have much love for this place. They have a phenomenal selection of beers, a different drink special every day, free popcorn, pizza specials on weeknights, and a decent selection of various food items. The food is nothing special, but adequate. Personal pizza with pineapple and green peppers, or the veggie wrap were my go-tos. They will accommodate groups of 10+ and have multiple rooms to hang out in.  The Winking Lizard does mixed beers in unusual combos like the \"black and blue,\"  which is one of my personal favs (Labatt and Guinness). There are tvs to watch the game, and the bathrooms are kept decently clean. They even have an iguana to greet you as you enter the bar! Someone take a picture of that guy, please!   With so many seedy college dive bars on Coventry, this place fills the niche of a moderately priced place for grad students who don't need .50 well shots, but don't want to pay grown-up prices, just yet."}
{"text":"I came here a lot during the rec sports seasons. A group of 10-15 of us would come in sweaty and tired and get a few drinks with a meal. The servers were able to accommodate our large group every single time except for two when some Thursday football was on. It was always Thursdays, so most of us took advantage of their $5 burger special. I got the Turkey burger almost every single time and I love it. The fries are fine, but I usually end up with the steamed broccoli. A little salt and they make for a healthy and tasty alternative to fries.   This is a great place for beer snobs. They have an extensive beer list that changes every month. They already have a great beer selection, so even if you get tired of whatever they have, you can come back a few weeks later and get some of the new beers in rotation. They have the drink of the month which comes with a beer glass, and they usually have some other special where you can get a glass as well. I have never tried the beer tour because I don't want to spend $600 on a jacket and a duffle bag. We did have people all drinking on one person's tour, which seems like the only reasonable way to go about it.   If you're down for skee-ball, go up the stairs in the back to play with your friends. If you want a bar without all of the noise, head downstairs to Lizardville for a huge selection of craft beer. My favorite part of this is the pick-6 packs that you can make.   I know I'll be back here again. It's a great casual restaurant for most occasions."}
{"text":"Had a blast good food and cheap drinks while in town to check out a yankee vs indians ballgame."}
{"text":"This Winking Lizard location is no different then any others- it's great!  For the Cavs Parad they made sure to only allow in an appropriate amount of people to adhere to fire codes.  Most other bars/restaurants allowed so many people inside you couldn't move, and it wasn't safe.  They put their customer's safety over the possibility of making more of a profit.  The food is always delicious, the service fast and polite, and the restaurant a clean and fun environment.  Thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard has some pretty solid bar food and a fantastic selection of beers.  One of my favorite things about the Wink is the glass of the month where you can buy a beer in a fancy-pants glass and then you get to take it home!  I don't think I've spent more than $6 on this combo before, so it's a pretty good deal.  Also, they have some pretty insanely awesome beer specials.  You can get a 32 ounce beer for $5 pretty much every night of the week.  They change beer depending on what day it is.  You really can't beat that.  If you're not a beer drinking, the mixed drinks leave a lot to be desired (at least if you order them off the menu).  The Margarita for 2 is basically a glass of sour mix.  The Lakewood Winking Lizard is by far my favorite location.  The place is HUGE!  It is inside an old house, which is really cool.  Also, you can rent out a bowling alley in the basement for parties.  You heard me right...a bowling alley.  It also features a really nice patio in front.  The server was fast, helpful, and very personable.  He made the visit very enjoyable.  I will definitely be back here many times in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped by Winking Lizard for lunch with a co-worker. We were immediately seated and given menus. We found the lunch specials and a hot Italian sub with fries was on spotlight. We both ordered it and then chatted for a bit. Just a few minutes later, our hot subs with fries were delivered. They looked amazing and tasted even better. I'm going out on a limb and declaring that this is one of the top five hot Italian subs that I've ever tasted. The bread was hot and moist. The meats were piled high, tender, and delicious. The red onions were on point and left me tasting the sandwich an hour after I ate it. Sorry coworkers! Screw the ketchup, I dipped my fries in their delicious BBQ sauce.  My coworker agreed that the sub was yummy.  Loved the sandwich and will be back for more lunch specials. They have happpy hour burgers and fries for $6.99 after 3pm. That's a deal as these burgers are usually $9.99!  Yum!"}
{"text":"We went downtown to see the Bodies exhibit, which rocked and then we stopped in for some Lizard fare.  Sorry to report, I ordered the same old, same old - steak wrap with fries.  It's so delicious that I order it every time!  This visit was no disappointment either.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium and the fries were off the hook, as usual.  I dipped both the wrap and my fries in their yummy BBQ sauce which is conveniently located on every table.  Our server was unusually friendly and talkative.  He was very curious about the Bodies exhibit we had just visited, so we gave him our pamphlet from the event.  Another great meal!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go have a beer and chat. Great for the sports enthusiast with the multitude of Tv's. We go for glass of the month and have been doing so for the past 4 years. We of course have a lot of glass ware. Ha ha. They have great wings, potato skins (my fave), and the Oreo oblivion brownie sundae is awesome! Will the beermaster is always friendly and his fellow bartenders are fun to talk to. A great hang out."}
{"text":"Food is good- wings, salmon and gyro. Service was lacking. Order was brought to table wrong and had to ask two more times until I cancelled the order. Still waiting to be asked for a refill.  Wasn't very busy either. Staff was very nice tho."}
{"text":"The Winking Lizard has been around long before I can remember, as a kid my parents used to come here with there friends, so when I had an opportunity to come here with AN I Couldn't wait! We came here on a Sunday afternoon around lunch and the restaurant was surprisingly empty, maybe 7 cars in the parking lot.  As we walked in there was a popcorn machine half full and help yourself.  We were quickly seated and served with menus.  It then took a while for someone to take our drink order.  Finally we got our drinks and then it was another wait for our appetizer order, surprisingly for such an empty restaurant.  We ordered the Lizard Chips as our appetizer which are basically fried pickles with a honey dipping sauce, and they were very good! After another extended wait we were able to order our dinner.  AN and I both ordered half racks of ribs because that's what I remember the Winking Lizard being famous for!  When our ribs arrived we didn't hesitate to dig in and they were good, not out of this world or earth shattering but definitely good.  The Winking Lizard isn't somewhere I'd go out of my way to go to, I'd probably maybe come here again but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, the service was just ok and the prices seem \"a little\" high and the food was pretty good but it didn't WOW me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. Food, drinks and service were all good. Clean bathrooms as well. (Always a plus)"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get a drink and have some wings. Service seems to be spotty....this is my 2nd visit and its not busy, but the servers always seem a little unsure of what their next move will be. I give 4 stars because the food and drinks are on point!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever had here is the wings but those are good enough that I don't mind leaving my thoughts.    Soooo, Tuesdays are 50-cent wing nights.  That's an amazing deal!  You can get the wings in sets of 5 and get a different flavor for each set.  Once I try the Wednesday ribs I'll update my review.  I'm pretty excited about that.    Anyway, the atmosphere is pretty cool; they have many TVs so if you want to watch a game or something it's perfect for a group.  Update: ok, so the ribs aren't that great.  They are pretty good and for the price I'd probably get them again but if you're picky about your ribs these might upset you.  They are a little dry and their sauce isn't anything special but I am easy to please when it comes to food usually so I loved them."}
{"text":"Would I go here again? Sure, why not. Is the food that great? Meh, I just got appetizers.   Went here with a friend after he distastefully hated the food at Greenhouse Tavern (and I also, did not care for the appetizers there). It's definitely a sports bar/place- lots of tables, lots of tvs. The giants were in game 5? or game 4, I don't really remember.  He got the cream of wheat- a crazy mix of guinness and some type of wheat ale- I love how the densities of them just separate the two. The taste... well, he liked the taste... I guess it was interesting? I just got the dogfish head punkin ale. Yum yum for pumpkin.   We ordered the bbq riblets and spinach and artichoke dip. The portions were definitely big and enough for us to share. I liked the riblets- they were tender and not overcooked. I just felt they were over slathered with sauce. The spinach and artichoke dip... was well, your normal. Had they used a little less salty chips, I think it would have been better (what can I say....).  Overall, though, this place ain't too bad. I liked how it was an okay noise level- even with the playoffs going on, I could still hear my friend and myself as well, without having to yell over the ridiculous noise that usually fill sports bars. In terms of food... meh... I need to come back and try the real brews and food. But overall, it's definitely a cool place to chill with a friend or two."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland from Texas and was looking for a local restaurant instead of big chain. Staff was cool. Food was good for a good price. Atmosphere was good and so was the happy hour. Bartender could have been more attentive. Seems like I was a little ignored which is why they get 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Tried eating here in the weekend and it was hotter inside the restaurant than outside and there was no service on the patio."}
{"text":"Always crowded so expect to wait. Huge place though so turnover is constant. Beer list is amazing food is great. Wings are good and sauce selection is extensive. I had a brat burger which was to die for. I hope it makes it on the permanent menu."}
{"text":"Orderd the western burger today via carryout , altho they forgot the bbq it was quite good.  Staff was polite and i enjoyed that atmosphere whilst i was there, quite and homey feel"}
{"text":"This was my first time being at this Winking Lizard location and the server and food are both very quality. The server was attentative to our tables needs and make us aware of the specials. They have such a large menu that you can try something new each time. I tried the Steak Asparagus Salad and while this sounds really different the flavors work well together. I usually get bored with salad half way into the meal though this kept me entertained because they did not skimp on the toppings or steak. I also had a cup of the Artichoke Chicken soup, this was recommended by the server. I didn't know what to expect though it was very creamy and surprisingly had a lot of artichokes and good sized pieces of chicken. I would recommend both and will certainly come back on another trip to Independence. This was a working lunch so next time will be trying out a brew from the vast collection they have."}
{"text":"Stopped in after Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Staff was friendly. Food was really good. Boneless bourbon wings, garlic Parmesan wings, and lemon pepper wings were all delicious. My burger was cooked perfectly. The steak fries were awesome. My margarita was subpar though. I would definitely visit again if in the area of this chain. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Wings, burgers, salads, pizza, ribs, beer; The Winking Lizard does everything, and they do it pretty damn well, too.  I normally come for 35 cent wings on Monday or Tuesday (try the Thai, Sesame Ginger, and Caribbean flavors), but also not to be missed are the delicious burgers and great beer selection.  You really can't go wrong here (even the pizza is great), so why aren't you on your way to the Lizard right now?"}
{"text":"This place is THE place to go when you are craving for some yummy wings!!! Go on Monday and Tuesday if you can - wings are on sale.  It is a loud place so be prepared to kinda yell at each other to carry a conversation, but it is a bar place where people just chill and watch sports usually."}
{"text":"The winking lizard really is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. The atmosphere, the people, the wide variety of bar foods and the extensive beer selection is really why I keep coming back to this place. It's one of those places you can come back to time and time again from watching Sunday football to grabbing some food with friends! The patio outside is perfect for watching baseball games in the summer"}
{"text":"Being an advice traveler of 25 plus years. This has to be one of the rudest taverns I have had the unfortunately pleasure of visiting.   The hostess told us just to go have a seat outside. Which we wanted too do.  We waited forever for a waitress to find out we should have been seated.  Upon which the MGR approach us because we had a chicken filet bag. Which was only a snack wrap.  We had already order adult beverage and 2 cups of soup.    They where all concerned about the wrap. The failed to notice we had already order more food.  Poor consumer service upon the MGR here.  I would NOT recommend this place.   The drinks are weak  Mgr is lousy. Only thing good about this place was our waitress.  She did all she could to make up for poor Mgt."}
{"text":"Very disorganized, even on a weeknight. Took several tries before even getting seated, and then no wait staff ever appeared to even take drink orders. Eventually it was time to just give up and leave.  Numerous staff walked past, carefully gazing into the unknown so they wouldn't have to acknowledge the Table of the Damned. I cannot say why, but I got the impression they weren't interested in seating a small party--they gave their attention to bigger fish. Even though small tables are plentiful.  Also of note: wall to wall TVs. That may be a plus or a minus, depending on your preferences..."}
{"text":"WL is good, loud, fun.  Nothing all that special, but they stick to the classics and they do them well.  Sandwiches, burgers, wings make up 90% of the menu.  They have a great beer selection, with a lot of brews I've never heard of.  Definitely try the Tour of Beers if you live in the area, its a lot of fun.  Service is standard, like everything else there.  We like to go and visit Erma, their live-in iguana. (It wouldn't be called Winking LIZARD if there wasn't a lizard there, right?)"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would.  We arrived an hour before the bar closed (after the baseball game on Saturday night at 11 pm) and they told us the kitchen was closed but we could have a drink. Our group was too large to sit at the bar but we were told we could sit at a couple of tables. Our group waited 15 min and no server came to take our order so we went to the bar. We were then told that we had to order from a server instead of the bar. They couldn't find us a server so the bartender took our order. A couple of minutes later the manager came over and told us we couldn't sit there because the kitchen was closed. After we explained our situation, she said that it didn't matter. It was 45 minutes before the bar closed! Several tables were still ordering drinks and food in a different part of the restaurant but we weren't allowed to have a drink!  Their customer service was atrocious and I would not recommend them to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"What happened to winking lizard . Just sitting at the bar.... 15minutes later no one has served me..."}
{"text":"Had dinner/reception in their 'party room'. The beer selection was excellent. Gotta love seeing a place that offers Bells Two Hearted Ale. The room was spacious and well laid out with TV's and a pool table. Unfortunately, their satellite wasn't working, so we weren't able to watch the football games. The food was okay but nothing special. The bartender was very friendly and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Cool location, I don't understand all the disliking of the new location, but I had never been to the old one so maybe that is why.  Set right in the heart of Independence, easy to get to.  Very cool outdoor area, bar and tables under cover and then a patio for true outdoor dining.  Also a good number of TV's for viewing the games, etc.  Very cool scene, great selections of beers."}
{"text":"Great wings/traditional bar food restaurant right next to all the stadiums in Cleveland. Beer selection is top tier. Any time I wanna watch the game and eat some grub, its perfect! Won't blow you away but that's not their MO.   Tricks of the trade: They have free popcorn at the front entrance If you have children check out the huge lizard also in front  My favorite beer special is the 32once deal for around 5 dollars depending on what beer is featured (it's huge) Get the wings, sauces are great! Wing night Monday/Tuesday Wednesday rib night better than you will expect and great deal! bald stocky bartender nicknamed sugar, big fan"}
{"text":"Delicious food in a casual, welcoming atmosphere. I had the Blue 'Shroom Burger and it was amazing... even the fries were perfectly made. I don't review much on Yelp but I wanted to review Winking Lizard... not only to share the news but to make sure I remember to come back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I like to come here when I am in downtown Cleveland for concerts and it is a great place to warm up after Browns games. Last weekend I met up here with a bunch of friends while I was at the NCAA Wrestling Tournament.  Stopped in between sessions and after less than a ten minute wait I was in the door. The decor is an homage to beer, cookiness, and Cleveland. The crowd was happy, drinking, festive, and it created a great atmosphere. Since my friends were already at a table, I just had a slight wait at the bar to get a drink before I went over to join them.  The service was fast considering they were pretty full. Within minutes of sitting down I was asked if I wanted to place an order and about twenty minutes later I had a great burger, onion rings, and another beer. They have really good grilled onions, their onion rings were outstanding, and my burger was cooked to perfection.  The food prices are pretty fair considering they are downtown. Their beer selection is extensive both on tap and by bottle. I have no problem recommending this place to anyone working downtown and those visiting for a Cavs, Indians, Browns game; concert; or anything special going on."}
{"text":"My first time at this place.  It was a Tuesday night and it was JAMMED.   This location has limited parking in front (more in back).  The beer offering is awesome.  I was able to have a couple of nice beers that I can't get back home.  I took advantage of the  50 cent wing special on Tuesdays.   I had the Cajun, Thai, and Goldfinger.  They were  all good.  I was very happy with the food and the bill.  It was about 30% lower than I expected ($60 bill for three people with drinks)."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection - so many to choose from! They have decent bar food, tons of TVs - great spot to grab lunch before the Browns game this past Sunday. The place was PACKED - we arrived right when they opened at 11:00AM. Service was a little on the slow side, but understandably so considering every table in our section was filled. The restaurant is also HUGE. We had an order of the 6-Pepper dry rub wings which were good. The blue cheese and ranch dressings we ordered both good as well- they make them in-house or specifically for the Winking Lizard and come in the little sealed containers with the Winking Lizard logo. I had the buffalo chicken wrap with fries which was good too. I would return again for beers before an event or to watch sports."}
{"text":"I love this place--best wings in CLE, in my opinion. Try the salt and vinegar dry-rub ones...outstanding. I love the thick-cut fries and the cole slaw.   I only wish they had a larger selection of hard ciders. I don't like beer but love cider!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go to watch a game in the downtown Cleveland area. Menu features classic bar/American food and drinks menu is pretty extensive. I split an order of the macaroni & cheese bites (macncheese fried... You really can't go wrong!) and a small pizza for myself. You could tell pizza dough was homemade and very fresh- I enjoyed a small cheese pizza. As for the other menu items, they all seemed good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Atmosphere is good for big groups and before or during games- although I would call or book ahead, as wait times can get long.  I don't think I'll come back, only because I'm not a huge fan of bar food. If you're into this cuisine, I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Love going here to watch a game or hang out with friends. Huge beer selection and food selection. Also love lizardville!"}
{"text":"I am a relatively big fan of all the Winking Lizard locations. It's never at the top of my list of places to go, but whenever I end up there, I almost always enjoy it. That being said, I tried Winks with a friend for lunch today and we both REALLY liked it.   The menu has about a quarter of the selection that a normal Winking Lizard menu has, but, that being said, there's still about 20x more options than a lot of other places. I opted for the Roasted Veggie Wrap with frites (more on those later) and my friend got the Pressed Steak Wrap.   We bit into our wraps at the same time and instantly and unintentionally exclaimed \"YUMMMM!\" in unison. My veggie wrap (about $7.50 with fries) was fantastic - maybe the least wimpy veggie wrap I've ever had! It was full of really flavorful warm veggies like mushrooms, roasted peppers and onions, and had a nice layer of fresh spinach that helped keep the veggie juices from making the tortilla soggy.   So - the frites. I am not schooled in fries vs. frites - what's the difference? Probably animal fat.   These were maybe the best fries I've ever had! They reminded me of the awesome carnival fries from Rockne's, only re-fried about 25 times so they are extra crispy. Each fry (frite?) was like eating a tiny stick of crunchy potato-flavored butter.   At first, it took our server an unusually long time to come over and take our drink order - which usually does not bode well... However, when he did come, he was actually very sincere and apologetic and for the rest of our lunch, kicked ass!   I can't wait to go back and try the black bean burger that they apparently make in-house.  This was my first visit to Winks. I see that the other handful of Yelp reviews were from a few months ago, when they were first opening. I am hoping that maybe Winks management got bad feedback during their first few months and have actually improved those issues. I really didn't notice any of the negative things mentioned in the other reviews - ESPECIALLY the food not being good. I thought it was GREAT!  I will definitely be back!  Yay Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I am shocked I never received reviewed this place.    This is my standby place.   The food is good, typically short wait times.   This is much like the rest if the chain.   They have improved bar food and interesting specials.    I recently got a lamb burger which was delicious.    The service is typically good, but I have had eh service too.   Some highlights are the boneless wings (and sauces), salads, and burgers.   They also have a beer challenge, but this seems like a money waster.   They do have a lot of different beer choices."}
{"text":"I dined at Winks on Friday, March 22 with a few co-workers. It was a very busy afternoon, most of the servers were scrambling to attend to their customers.  Andrea, who was NOT our server, stopped to say hello because she recognized my co-worker who is a frequent diner.  She took the time to tell us about your specials and soup of the day eventhough we weren't her table!  I was so impressed by her level of customer service and sheer commitment to our dining experience. I was WOWED and thought that Andrea deserved a special shout out.  You are lucky to have her on your staff!  I'll be back... and probably asking for Andrea!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go for some amazing beer and amazing food!! Nothing is better than wings and beer!! The staff are very friendly and always welcoming. I love the food here...from their spicy bbq wings to bo mans burger to their preffered fries!! you have to get the preffered fries!!! I love this place!! WIsh i could eat here everyday lol"}
{"text":"A really fun place.  They have a menu page just for the month before Mardi Gras.  And then a Fat Tuesday page. The place was hopping for a Monday evening.  Only seat open was at the bar.  Bartenders were great. Got the mac & cheese wedges and the Muffuletta from the Mardi Gras menu.  Ordered it without the ham and salami, since those things aren't normally edible :-).  Everything came out perfectly timed. While I was munching on the wedges (very tasty), one of the kitchen staff came out to verify I didn't want the ham and salami as the sandwich wouldn't be as filling then.  I advised that was just fine, and yes it turned out to be just fine.  The Muffuletta was more than filling enough with just the pepperoni and all the other ingredients, and had a wonderful taste. The people on either side of me weren't very talkative, but it was fun watching the highlights of Monster Trucks - Football - Nascar & Soccer that were on the wall of TVs in front of me.  Never seen Monster Trucks do flips on purpose before... Anyway, this was a fun place to go with great service and food."}
{"text":"I don't mind Winking Lizard for bar food. They always have big iguanas sitting in big glass enclosures, so that really pumps me up no matter what. My favorite is the one downtown, it really is a magnificent creature of the earth. My favorite part of the Coventry location would have to be their caged iguana. I stopped in for a beer or two, and it was murder trying to stand around and drink. Judging by what the wait staff and hostess were telling us, they prefer you to be seated at the bar or a table. You can't really ramble around stumbling and bumbling like I was born to do. They did have Old Rasputin on tap which was nice."}
{"text":"I love the view of this location. I wish they would just continue throwing more trash up on the hill by Valley View / Garfield Heights so we could have an even better view. I have been cutting back on meat lately and the Winking Lizard doesn't have a ton of options without some kind of meat in it. When I do eat wings, I think the Winking Lizard wet cajun are the best flavor. I had the salmon dinner for 8.99 with the wet cajun sauce on the side. It was great. It comes with a side and you can swap out the coleslaw for another side for a 99 cent upcharge. I had broccoli and rice pilaf. It seemed like a good deal for around 10 dollars. The beer list at Winking Lizard is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Would give a much better review but it was cold. Took long time to get food and a awhile to check out. They need to work on these things not acceptable for such a good chain."}
{"text":"Went there a lot when my son was small. Kid friendly with the lizard. Lots of kids and noise. Always see friends but the food marginal. 4 stars for atmosphere"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DA SHIT!!! Everyone needs to eat here! super nice and cool waitresses and bomb food. very satisfied"}
{"text":"The winking lizard is a go to place for family and friends to get together for either food or drinks. I love the extensive beer menu, there is something for everyone! The downside is I don't have much luck with ordering food. It's either a hit or miss especially with carry out. They either forget my meal or bring me the wrong thing. Also, some things are just subpar or average. They do have really good salads and I've enjoyed items in their seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Arrived there right before lunch rush, food came out fast and tasty. We sat outside since we had our toddler there. Great beer selection, would like to go back again."}
{"text":"Great local neighborhood restaurant and bar. I love to come here for happy hour and dinner with coworkers and hang out at a high table in the bar with popcorn, margaritas, lizard freckles (fried pickle chips- order them with ranch!) and burgers. If you are a beer drinker you will love this place- hundreds of options!!"}
{"text":"Goodness, this was the best Winking Lizard I've been to so far!  It's dinner time and we were seated promptly in an almost packed place.  Our server was always attentive and in a good mood.  He got us everything we wanted and was even patient with our questions.  I never had to search for him for a new ketchup bottle or more drink.  Plenty of napkins for my awesome wings and the wedge salad was to die for!  Prompt friendly service topped with great food gets 5 stars in my book!!"}
{"text":"Small little place located in Macedonia.  14 TV's in the dining room, and more in the bar.  Our service is usually decent although I've had better elsewhere.  Compared to other Winking Lizard's, the portion sizes here are on the skimpy side.  Still, popcorn is available, real lizard to look at, and clean place to visit if your hungry."}
{"text":"Small, clean and neat, but slow on service, average food and really nothing all around special about the place.  Our waitress was nice, but everything was all around SLOW and there weren't very many people in the place.  We went during an off time, around 3pm, so there wouldn't be a wait, but come on!  There were skimpy on serving size.  I always had to remind them to bring me a drink and napkins for the kids.  I couldn't believe when I had to track her down for our check.  We really could have walked out of there and I don't think anyone would have noticed.  Maybe that is why there were so empty....."}
{"text":"Visiting the Rock and Roll hall of fame, decided to get lunch. After seeing the crazy prices for substandard food, decided to Yelp what was close by. A meet .25 miles was Winking Lizard. Food was really delicious and prices were right on. The service was also amazing. Totally recommend if in the area. 5 people in my party and each dish looked and tasted great (according to everyone)!"}
{"text":"Solid post-work happy hour stop. That really sums it up for me.   It's a great stop for drinks, and the food is just your standard American fare. Burgers, fries, wings, some wraps, and throw in some potato skins or whatever. This location is pretty large, with a outdoor patio (with a stunning view of the parking lot), and some event space in the back for parties. During the week they have some good happy hour specials - which wlil always and forever make me happy. I love happy hour. Good selection of beers, local craft in addition to the typical bud light selection. Service can vary, but overall this place is A-ok in my book!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It's a sports bar, what more do you want than a big beer selection, some decent food to chow down on (even with some healthy options), and lots of TVs and an atmosphere for good times with friends?  Not sure why this is rated so low.  Granted yes they are always sold out of a lot of the beers on the menu and should probably just use a chalkboard instead, but I don't think that justifies 1-star!  Solid place to grab drinks and grub and meet with friends in Macedonia."}
{"text":"Didn't want to review another Lizard after already doing the downtown one, but i'm in a bit of a drought and need to hit 300 reviews by my birthing day. Plus the horror that was Morgantown, West Virginia earlier in the week really made me appreciate what i have right down the street.   Saturday was pretty low key there even with all the sports on tv. AND the mighty 1985 NBA draft! Shouts out to Patrick Ewing, Xavier McDaniel, Detlef Schrempf and Karl Malone(taken at 13? wtf?) for helping me relive my childhood card collecting days. Sadly, Manute Bol passed as i munched my quesadillas. They were decent, cheap and light.  The beer- -A Brooklyn Summer Ale 22 for cheap, 16 oz German something or other and a bottle of domestic. Grand total was 19 Lizard skins. The bartender was way friendly and quick with the pour.  I love the building! Lots of seating, long ass bar, outdoor seating by unfortunately pretty crappy stretch of Detroit and has it's own character unlike some other franchises. If i didn't need to Yelp so many other places, i would definitely stop in more. Maybe after i hit my goal."}
{"text":"Okay, this place isn't CBGB's. It's pretty family friendly and sports obsessed. But sometimes, that's what i want. The one downtown is the best during or after a game, or the st. patty's day parade( as if i would take part in that nonsense). There are of course hundreds of obscure beer choices. In bottles. I don't go to a tavern to drink bottles. Luckily, the drafts number in the teens and always taste fresh. The food is solid. The veggie burger has long been one of my favorites. The fish sandwich is also decent.  All of the franchises exhibit the same high marks in terms of quality.   Don't bring a goth teenager here. She will hate you."}
{"text":"Outstanding beer selection with good bar food.  A place to grab a beer after work or to watch the game.  All and all it's a franchise bar that has been able to hold onto it's neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Great American/bar food. This is located in the Valley and it's pretty good. They have a pretty poplar sports bar too, where lots of people watch the Browns or the Indians in the summer. The service is excellenet and the place is kept up nicely!"}
{"text":"Good bar food, lots of TV's to watch sports on but the service I had was awful. It took forever for her to come over to us and then she only came back to our table about two times and did a very poor job at making sure the order was correct."}
{"text":"Excellent beer menu. Solid food choices, and the monthly specials are always good. Though I have not been here for lunch in a while. The lunch specials are good."}
{"text":"After my couple business trips to OH, I didn't really realize that there are actually bars near the hotel - nonetheless a bar that appeals to the younger ones.   A few of us gathered for some drinks and food before a bunch of us had to fly back to our respective homes. It's your typical bar - drinks and everything with your typical bar food - wings, sandwiches, salads.   I had a beer and gyro for the night - both delicious. The service was ok and could be improved, but it was a bit busy that night.   I'll definitely come back if I'm in town for business - as long as the company is good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before a charity even to have a drink, so I can't speak about the food.  The atmosphere was casual and it had a great outdoor spot.  One of the waiters (whom we didn't have) was great!  We sat at the bar and our bartender wasn't particularly attentive, but was nice enough.  My drink tasted very weak and the vodka tasted \"replaced\" - i.e. not top shelf as ordered."}
{"text":"A great, close-to-home staple.  Although the fare is always solid, our experience definitely varies based on who is waiting on us.  A few of the bartender regulars know my fianc√© and I and understand that I loooooove lots of condiments.  Others find me annoying with that, and ignore me, so I am left without that crucial blue cheese or extra hot sauce.  Otherwise, great wings, good specials (check out their daily lunch specials!) and a nice patio with good views of the tv.  We will continue going here for many years to come."}
{"text":"Very nicely done restaurant in a great location (at least for us!) and the beer cheese dip was really good.  It comes with a heater under it, so it stays nice and hot the whole time (like a fondue) and almost a whole load of bread!  We also got celery to go with it too.  The French onion soup was just ok - it was pretty salty from being over-reduced.  But I am a French onion soup snob.  It isn't on the menu, but they DO have it!  The burgers the other diners had looked great and we will be back to try them for sure.  TV situation is SPECTACULAR!  Great for watching a game.  While I am still a Lizard fan, this is a nice option for a more upscale vibe."}
{"text":"I visited Winking Lizard Tavern while in Cleveland to see the new Southern Tier Brew Company Cleveland location (across the street). Winking Lizard is a great bar with amazing food. We split an appetizer of beer cheese and pita and I had a chicken Philly. Both were great and a week later I have a craving for more. The portion is definitely plentiful and well worth the money. The beer selection is enormous, if you can't find something you like, then you really don't like beer. I even found some Southern Tier on the list, but chose the Cleveland micro brews out of respect for the area.   The location is great, walking distance to the Cavaliers arena and Indians baseball, plus there is a parking ramp close by.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sportsball.  They have more TV's than I can count. A lot of beers on tap.  Standard bar food comfort food.  Nice ambiance for a sports bar.  Almost upscale yet chill. Wing nights Mon and Tues."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but the bartender never poured a full beer!  To say she was unfriendly is being kind.  Due to the bad service we left without ordering food."}
{"text":"It has great beers selection, decent food, lots of TV and a 16 page menu with decent service.  If you looking for wings or good burger and beers it a great spot to watch a game."}
{"text":"Cider, beer, wings, shuffle board and tv screens.  Good place to unwind after a long week."}
{"text":"Very large menu and food is decent. I'm there every week for a skeeball league so I would like to see them change up the menu, especially the side dish options, just a little maybe once a year to keep it new. Shannon is our server for the skeeball league and she is awesome."}
{"text":"This location is a little smaller than the one in Canton, but it's still the same old comfort/casual vibe that 'the lizard' has become known for.  Try the Paddle and get 4 samples of select beers for $6. Or if you're more daring sign your weekends away and start the World Tour and choose from over 300 beers from around the world and get prizes for finishing 50, 100, and 150 different beers.  The real insider tip is that if you get involved with the World Tour you HAVE to check out the World Tour Golf Outing which sells out every year.  If you need a more family friendly environment ask for seating in the dining room and you'll feel like you're at any other family restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"A fun beer bar / sports bar. The beer list is long with some great options. I only wish they had more locally brewed options.   We had the wings and pizza. It was good but certainly not the main attraction. The crowd was lively despite it being early in the week. The service was OK but our bartender was pretty clear she didn't have time to waste.   But my favorite thing was probably the giant iguana in the entranceway. He was awesome!"}
{"text":"I attend university in Athens, but when I'm home for summer and winter breaks my family and I visit the Winking Lizard--often weekly. The beer selection is the best of any local restaurant and the drafts are constantly rotating and always offer pleasant surprises. What really pleases me about the Winking Lizard is that they don't just serve typical mediocre bar food because let's face it: they totally could get away with it based on the beer offerings alone. There are daily specials (the wednesday rib night is a family favorite), but even if the nightly deals don't interest you, you'll be able to find something. There's always a seasonal menu designed to complement a featured beer. Last winter, on this menu, there was a brewmeister burger with guinness griddle onions, white cheddar, and mushrooms that I still think of with a fond tear in my eye... All of the burgers are worth trying (especially the western burger) and the pizzas are surprisingly delicious; no microwaves used here! Wings are always a safe bet. If you're feeling adventurous there is a Jamaican Jerk Chicken sandwich that is beguiling--smoky, spicy, and moist. The Winking Lizard can be both noisy and busy, particularly on weekends, but for a fun night with friends and family, there isn't a better choice for casual dining, reliable food, and otherworldly beers to be found in the area."}
{"text":"been here twice. once during lunch and another late night. around 10. the food was good both times. boneless wings first time. traditional 2nd.   really huge selection of beers and sodas.  the problem is the service is sllllooooooow.  I have an hour lunch at work and ended up getting back 20 minutes late.  not cool.  the late night one took awhile to get drinks and refills.  not on a schedule and was chit-chatting with friends. but who like an empty cream soda?  5 stars for food and beverage minus 2 for the wait."}
{"text":"Great place for a huge selection of craft beers.  Menu is pretty typical and what you would expect.  Very comfortable atmosphere for friends or watching the game."}
{"text":"Another terrible bartender.  I guess it is the new generation.  These young bartenders have no clue as to what customer service is.  They are so miserable and entitled.  The PATTY MELT is very good. Just disappointing service."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's got a certain sports-theme vibe that it actually does pull off - I'll give the Lizard that much despite being situated in a largely vacant Galleria mall; however, that's about it.   Food is unremarkable, service is unremarkable, boasts a beer selection from around the world which is unremarkable (no beer from Mexico, or Asia?!).  Last I checked, Corona, Dos Equis, Modelo, Sapporo, and Singha are all produced and sold around the globe.  Also, why the hate towards Sam Adams Light?  Really?   BREAKING NEWS = THIS JUST IN; WINKING LIZARD'S BEER LIST IS NOT GLOBAL.  Interesting and diverse menu options, but let me give you some perspective.   When one orders Nachos, one expects a higher grade of cheese used than what is served in movie theaters.....  but our Nachos were drowning in a yellow liquid representing something along the lines of cheese whiz.   In other words, while edible, the meal is nothing special to write home about.   Look, you're in downtown Cleveland, and there are not many options if wanting someplace fun to eat before heading in the direction of the Browns stadium or Rock & Roll HOF.   If all you want is a burger and fries for a quick lunch with what may or may not be a GLOBAL beer, sure, it beats McDonald's but, otherwise, the Lizard is unremarkable."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Rude waitress + sub-par food + annoyingly loud bar patrons = NO THANKS!  However, if you like being made to feel like you're inconveniencing your server, and for your food to arrive cold and bland, you will love this place!  I guess their one redeeming quality is the fact that they offer a bajillion different kinds of beer.  Maybe better experiences can be had at some of their other locations.  I've had the same experience at the Fairlawn one after three (very spaced out) attempts."}
{"text":"Winking Lizard is a classic staple to the Cleveland food scene. Their menu is endless which makes it super easy for everyone to find something they like! I typically get take out from this location because I live and work super close to it. They are pretty fast and do a great job at packaging everything up nicely. They have the most incredible BBQ sauce, it's amazing on their fries. Also recommend their buffalo chicken salad or buffalo chicken wrap! When it's nice out, I enjoy sitting on their patio."}
{"text":"So-so. My sister and I went here about a month ago because we thought the bar looked good. When we got there it was fully packed which was a huge surprise because it was a weeknight. I think there might have been a game on...or something.  Anywho, we sat at the bar because it was so busy and we thought we'd get better service. Truthfully, it wasn't really any better. We were about 20 years younger then that crowd's median age and the bartender seemed to think it was weird that we were there.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and a pitcher of one of their house drinks. Both of us thought that the dip was fine, but the pitcher was very weak. There was definitely almost no alcohol in it because I drank half and I'm a lightweight and I was barely feeling anything (3 beers does me in). When we got our bill we both kinda felt that we had over payed by about $10 for what we had received.   All in all, while the bar food looked good I don't think I'd go back because the atmosphere was so unpleasant. I think if the service had been more positive I wouldn't feel that way--but eh, some places are just like that."}
{"text":"We had wings, hot, which were perfectly acceptable for beer food and hit the spot. Two burgers, medium and rare, which were both cooked perfectly and served hot, with hot fresh French fries. A white pizza, served without tomatoes - perfect for our tomato haters - hit the spot, and was big enough to take half of it home when a large was ordered for one. A great deal. The beers were cold, and there was such a large selection. They had a list of beers for beginners and a list of diet choices. The bar had better lighting then the dining area, but we used our phone flashlights to look at the menu. It wasn't very busy around 9 on a Saturday night, either. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Cleveland.  Glad that this time we needed somewhere to eat and we were pleasantly surprised to see a Winking Lizard, as we were familiar with the brand. All of the bad reviews tempted to put us off, but we were starving and our past memory meant more than bad reviews - thankfully. Every member of the staff really made us feel welcome, from the kind waitress to someone we stopped to ask about Ohio liquor laws. (The floor manager and GM seemed eager to hear about our experience as well!)"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab lunch, servers take care of you and get you out quick enough.  The wings are the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with the shrimp and crab quesadilla. Disappointed that you don't get anything else with them meal besides a small amount of shredded lettuce."}
{"text":"Oh yes.  I am giving the Winking Lizard a One Star review.  Now, the food is average at best, overpriced and though they have an ample beer menu, they don't exactly have good beer specials in comparison with other Cleveland restaurants.  Oh, but one star?  Poor customer service and labeling.  At the Winking Lizard on Coventry, they demand an ID to prove patrons are over 21 at 5pm.  I understand how they are trying to eliminate underage drinking but here's my story....  I arrange for a work happy hour - expecting at least a dozen people.  One of these people is not a drinker and so left his ID at the hotel, not realizing that at the early time of 5pm he'd need it.  Were we let in?  No.  No exceptions were made.  He didn't need to drink and to be honest, he's in his late 20's anyway, so I feel like an exception could have been made by a good manager (I even offered to google/facebook him). Instead, she told us to leave and made no attempts or apologies.  We moved to Paninis but I had to sit outside the Winking Lizard for 45 minutes to wait for stragglers to let them know of the change of location.  What should have been done: An exception should have been made.  This person could have been marked and the bartender could have been told.  We were absolutely not expecting him to be served and we could have made accommodations if he couldn't even sit at our table.  In addition, there should have been labeling outside of the bar as well as online.  Instead, I was hugely inconvenienced and I'll never eat at the Winking Lizard again.  I'm serious."}
{"text":"Jamie, we love you.  What would our bowling team do without you?  Drink water?  The horror!!!!  Every week during bowling league (btw, Wednesdays are the best!), Jamie pours us our $4.50 LaBatts and keeps us happy while we inevitably bowl gutter balls and get into fights with accountants...  That's why we wouldn't know what to do without you, oh, bartender, Jamie!    The downstairs bowling alley at the Lizard in Lakewood is less retro than it used to be, but still expect holiday graphics to be showing two or three months after said holiday.  That's how they keep it real. There is plenty of Jon Bon Jovi on the jukebox, the popcorn is salty and like I said, Jamie is on the ball!  Haha...ball...bowling review...ha!    What else could you ask for?  Other than maybe a bowling score over 100...but that's a different story."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle, but been in Cleveland for school for the last 9 years and I must say that the Wink is one of two places I miss when I'm not in town (Cave du vin, is #2).  It's my automatic go-to place when I want to stuff my face with greasy food and wash it down with beer.  For some reason, these places are a dime a dozen in the Midwest, but haven't caught on in Seattle (not trendy? not ethnic enough?).     A.  Let's start with their series of 1/2 price specials: 1) Mon & Tue = WING NIGHT!  30 cents for wings (love the Thai and Caribbean).  Add a 32 oz Dortmunder and $8 later you're in a very good place.  It's also 1/2 price pizza night.   2) Wed = 1/2 price rib night?  I'm blanking -- I must have other plans on Wednesdays.   3) Thur = BURGER NIGHT! 1/2 price burgers (there are like 15 to choose from) -- sliders excluded :(  Their burgers are pretty average, but there is something inexplicably mesmerizing about the Winking Lizard slider.    B.  Atmosphere It's more restaurant than bar, but still the kind of place you can camp out and order a few rounds without looking like a lush.  I like that I can get a table and have a conversation with the people I came with instead of fighting over bad, loud music or giant tvs for someone's attention.  There are lots of tvs, yet they're much less intrusive than at your typical sports bar.  An added bonus is I guess this makes the Wink less appealing to the douchebags who frequent many of Coventry's other fine establishments.  Sure, the pet lizard is kind of strange and for some reason, the popcorn carts kind of freak me out, but it's all part of the charm.   C. Service The waitstaff is super friendly and efficient.  You won't be stuck with an empty glass for long before someone comes by to take your order, and your food generally takes less than 15 minutes to come out.  Although, how long does frying ever really take?    Ultimately, the Winking Lizard is just a restaurant/bar with all-around decent, greasy food and a huge beer selection that's walking distance from my apartment.  But their specials rock and encourage patrons to eat and drink more than they had anticipated.  Genius!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Big menu. They have pretty good, cheap beer specials. Biggest knock on this place is the service. I've been here many times and have been treated poorly on several occasions. One time I walked in and there was no hostess there to greet our party (this was about 10pm). We sat down at an open table and a few minutes later a waitress came up to us. Rather than taking our drink order, she proceeded to chew us out for seating ourselves. I've had experiences like this several times. Get take out from this place, and save yourself abuse from the wait staff."}
{"text":"Nothing special here ( and there are locations all around Cleveland). Even the newer location on the west side on Detroit Road (may be in Westlake) is cut from the same mold.  Too many TVs, fake signs all over the place, average food and high prices. Fairly good selection of beers and you can sign up for one of their jackets if you really want to go to the same place far too many times to qualify.  Okay place to stop for a beer and a sandwich but Cleveland has too many places that are much better withing 3 or 4 miles."}
{"text":"We came here during a Cavs game, and it was AWESOME. It's like all the best parts of a sports bar without the noise or craziness of a normal one--probably the only sports bar in northeast ohio that doesn't have a single fan in it on game night haha, because any fan coming to this part of town is literally across the street at the Q. The burger was soooo good--I'm not a wings fan in particular, so I wasn't super into those. But I also hear the pizza is some of the best around. I just can't get over how much I loved being the only people in a place like this. It was quiet enough to talk normally, we could watch the game to our hearts' content, and the food was so great. Such a good experience!"}
{"text":"(1) The food was great!  I had the shrimp burger; as if it was made in the SF Bay Area!  The cole slaw was also very good; not overly spicy.  (2) The selection of beer and whiskey was amazing!  (3) The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Just sitting there listening to Jamie and Crystal giving lectures on the whiskeys and the beers was worth it!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for the Irish Fest, and saw someone wearing a Winking Lizard TShirt, and thought it sounded like a cool place, so we decided to seek it out.  I'm glad we did.  Lots to look at inside, lots of TVs, but, thankfully, they weren't all glaring at full volume.  I chose a burger, and I believe it was one of the best burgers I've had in a LONG time.  The steak fries, also, were outstanding.  I will say that our server was a bit aloof...certainly not rude, but she didn't make us feel especially welcome.  Typically, I'd drop more than one star from a review for that, but the burger was just that darn good.  We'll certainly return when we're back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"A big step below mediocrity.  Having frequented the Coventry location when we lived in Cleveland Heights - we figured we would get a burger and some wings one night from the Beachwood location now that we live in Shaker.  There really isn't much to say other than the food was below average - the burger had a piece of cheese that really only looked like an imprint of cheese - like it was painted on.  Wings were dry - and just not as good.  Clearly Winking Lizard is best after 3-4 beers - not before."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this 3.5 stars: it's a solidly good pub, with good service, tons of beer options and good food. If any of those things listed were \"great\" I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars. Overall, it's a place I'll look to go back to when in Cleveland. I had a Caesar wrap. Other enjoyed the ribs and amazing salads."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If I ever leave Cleveland, this will be one of the places that I miss the most!  For one thing, they have free popcorn at all hours of the day. I've been there at noon for a work luncheon and in the evening to enjoy a beer with friends and there is always fresh, hot, salty popcorn for the taking. Call me crazy, but the popcorn tastes especially good with their specialty BBQ sauce slathered on it!  Secondly, their specials are a great deal. Burger and pizza nights are especially good. Seriously, it's cheaper (and better!) than fast food! Not to mention that the food is great, even at regular prices.  Thirdly, the fact that they let you keep the glass that the beer of the month comes in (when it's in stock, that is!) is great. A large portion of my drinking class collection is courtesy of the Lizard. The beer selection is quite extensive too--I've been here many, many times and only ordered the same beer twice when I found a specific beer exceptional, not because there were no other options.  Fourthly, it's a great place to watch a sports game. The staff is really receptive to requests to change a specific TV to a certain game if nobody's watching it.   If you're looking for a great bar, head on out to the Lizard. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, free wifi, and sports. The buffalo chicken melt has a great kick but wasn't too spicy. The holiday beer of the month was delicious, affordable, & purchase included a souvenir glass. Basic burger joint / sports bar. We had a good time & our waiter was awesome."}
{"text":"Went here after the Cav's game.  GREAT crowd, which again is not surprising me anymore in Cleveland--I love the peeps here.  Had the melt, it was good, loaded fries tasted swell.. but I loved the Hofbrau Hefe.  I would say that the brew is very similar to a Franziskaner (which is also available here) but with a hint more of a hoppy after bite.   The two high points here are the giant lizard--yes a real lizard and the beer selection.  I will definitely return here one day an give the World Tour of Beers a whirl.  Prices very reasonable... the comparable venue in California would be The Yardhouse--if you're familiar w/ The Yardhouse then picture the Winking Lizard as a more humble, fairly priced and less cramped cousin.  Our waitress was great, she was knowledgeable w/ the beer selection and constantly checked on us when we really had no need to be checked on--I like that... She was like my aunt, making sure I was happy while on visitations.  Good people, open spacing, ego-less atmosphere make this a solid choice when you're in the area for some Cleveland athletics."}
{"text":"Nice bar restaurant chain in OH.  Solid lunchtime meeting location with good atmosphere, food & drink.  Server we had was very nice as well."}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had.  I always come for their Monday and Tuesday wing special, but I am actually disappointed that they removed the dry rubs. The 5 rub blend was the best.  That said, their wings are still great. They have this cool thermometer that compares the spiciness levels of their wings. Pro tip: anything past the \"Spicy Garlic\" is actually too spicy. The 911 is painful, and that's coming from someone who actually really likes spicy food.  They also have monthly beer specials, usually for $8, that gives you a free cup... for $8. Depending on the location, they usually still have cups that go with beer specials until mid December.   It makes me sad that I have to drive so far to have wings now, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Dropped in expecting a generic sports bar and found a cleveland sports bar with great service.  We were seated and helped immediately. The waiter was confident with what he recommended which turned out to be pretty good."}
{"text":"Had about 30 minutes to pop in before sound check down the street, and I'm glad I did!  Great local beers on tap, I forget what local IPA I tried, and I really enjoyed my jerk chicken sandwich.  Fries were crispy, bartenders were attentive, football was on TV.  It was the perfect getaway from tourlife for just a few minutes. Thanks Winking Lizard, next time I'm in town I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I work in the tower connected to the Galleria where Winks is located. We go there often just due to the proximity to our office.  Tonight we were having some co-workers who are from out of town out for Happy Hour. This was a true disappointment to share with them.  Either they had the server covering too many tables or he just didn't care. It took at least 30 minutes to order and receive our drinks from when we all arrived. Once we finally had them the server never stopped back to check on everyone at the table.  Their Happy Hour deals weren't anything to be overly excited about either, and it ends at 6pm which is disappointing. We came straight after work so many of us were hungry. But with no real variety in Happy Hour specials we didn't bother. Also unless you're a big beer drinker there really isn't too many specialty drinks on their either.   We had plans to go to the Westin instead and next time we will definitely head elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This was our final stop after the Indians/White Sox game. It was the only place of the three that had Yuenging on tap. All we ordered was the cheezy bacon fries and they hit the spot. It was a beautiful night to sit outside and drink one last celebratory beer before heading in for the night. If we return to Cleveland, we will be back."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Winking Lizard location, I think it is the setup of the restaurant.  Overall, the service here is good and the food is the same as the other locations but I prefer some of the others interior more."}
{"text":"I miss my Lizard and try to visit when we come up to visit.  Their wings are good, and I really like their pizzas.  They also offer super-sized beers which cuts down on the number of trips the server has to make!!  I've been to a couple of their world tour parties as a guest and they are a blast!!  It's expensive and time consuming to finish the tour but they do put on a nice event for those who do finish!!  This location also offers a bowling alley."}
{"text":"Just mediocre. I wouldn't even say this is a typical bar food place. Our food was cold and over cooked. Too much sauce on the wrap. Fries were soggy. Atmosphere is nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Nice location along coventry which caters to the beer aficionados. Love love love the daily 32 ounce beer specials !!! What a steal ! I usually love their meditaranean salads featured at other winking lizard locations but for some reason they didn't have it here nor the seasonal specials offered at other lizard locations. A little disappointed in this particular location with respect to food. Got an order of Wings which were obviously sitting around and had to ask for a fresh basket of wings (they were hard and rubbery). However along coventry this is a nice place to hit up for a beer. Also free popcorn as always"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection all around not to mention some awesome 32 oz daily specials . Wing night on Monday and Tuesday's but for me the Greek chicken salad has been kissing my grits as of late. $9.50 for a very generous bowl o cut romaine with cucumbers tomatoes feta roasted red peppers olives grilled chicken and a nom nom tasty meditaranean vinegrette. Service a little slow but hey Munch on some free popcorn while you wait"}
{"text":"We were passing through town and met some friends at Winks. The atmosphere was fun and welcoming. We particularly loved the Christmas Story leg lamps that adorned the bar and hostess station! For a Saturday night, the place seemed a little slow. Our friends chose it specifically because they felt it would be okay should their two little boys get rambunctious. As it turned out, they were pretty mellow and fit right in! Our server was super nice. He gave us some excellent suggestions of craft beers. My husband loved the Chocolate Peanut Butter Stout, I enjoyed an amber and an oatmeal stout. Very tasty! The food was also very good. We had a salad with the cucumber wasabi dressing, which was delicious. I enjoyed the cheese dip appetizer, which was huge and definitely a dish to share. It seems like this place is really more for the weekday crowd, as they close the kitchen on Saturday and Sunday at 8 pm. But the menu was really interesting with lots of yummy sounding options like wings, interesting sandwiches and unique pizzas. They also cater to the Cleveland Browns games and have lots of great happy hour deals. The next time we're in Cleveland, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some booze after dinner at Tommy's and it didn't disappoint.  There is quite a good beer selection, especially in bottles.  I had a couple local beers which were decent, though not spectacular.  I didn't try any food, but it all looked to be standard fried everything pub food, so I doubt I was really missing too much.  Other than that it's really just an average bar... worthy of stopping in, but not a place you'd go out of your way for.  I did like the multiple TVs above the bar with multiple sporting events on."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service sucked. I went just barely came by and we did not leave her a tip."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for dinner last night, and the place was packed! Which was surprising for a Tuesday evening.  I was not the first to arrive, however once I did order my drink, it took a while (as well as a stop from our server without the drinks) and a reminder that we would like our drinks before we order our food.  After ordering our meals, I noticed a table next to us that had half their food, one person having nothing to eat while the others let their food go cold waiting for their friends food to arrive.  Thought that was strange.  Then another table had some activity, they looked disappointed and had abruptly left. Meanwhile back at my table.  My friends salad is delivered missing a few items. A few minutes later, my sandwich is delivered. Now I'm expecting my friends meals to follow shortly behind.  Not so much. I have to give credit to the managers. They stepped in quickly. They stopped by our table to inform us that our food would be out and offered us a drink. Although about 15-20 minutes had passed between my sandwich being delivered and the rest of the tables food. I'm not sure what the problem was last night. If it was our server or issues in the kitchen. I have never had such a strange experience at this location in the past. If it wasn't for the managers I don't know if we would have ever received our food, or if I would ever visit again. They saved the evening for us."}
