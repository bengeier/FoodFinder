{"text":"My favorite take out! Fast and oh so delicious!!! Salt and pepper shrimps are to die for and , as someone alreadg pointed out : peanut butter dumplings are ah mazing :)"}
{"text":"Hey All,  Went to pick up some Pad Thai and Peanut Butter Dumplings to go last week round 8:30pm. Was starving and hoping that they would not disappoint!  My order was a little odd seeing that one Pad Thai was ordered without any egg or bean sprouts, many times when this order is placed the Pad Thai is dry and still have egg in it.  But this time it was pefectly executed! The take out container was filled to the brim and for 2 big eateres that were starving, there was more than enough left overs for lunch the next day.  The dumplings were a redish color, but they were firm and tasted great. I even poured some sauce into my Pad Thai.  Really great, glad we still have options for Pad Thai in Chateaugauy:) Go on, try it!"}
{"text":"No matter what I order at Zen, I'm never disappointed. Their peanut butter dumplings are out of this world and have this incredibly rich, flavourful peanut sauce that I wish I could purchase by the gallon. The portion sizes are enormous and usually last me 2 full meals. The containers are made out of very durable plastic and are great for re-use."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the best bang for your buck!  Overtime I have ordered from this restaurant, I am never let down.  I have tried several different noodle dishes, soups and sides and they never let me down.  Great flavour, great ingredients and fast service.  Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Meh. It was alright, I guess. We went there Saturday and upon entering I noticed immediately that they were really busy because they get tons of callers for orders but that didn't hinder them to give our orders in less than 15minutes, I'd say that's a really good and fast service.   Why the two stars then? Uh, the food serving was really plenty that we had leftovers for the next day, I can say that for sure, however the food wasn't that great. It's not something I'd crave in the near future. We ordered a general tao chicken, fried rice maison, shrimp in scallop sauce and the ravioli in peanut butter sauce.   General tao chicken wasn't as crispy as the one for Kam Shing, but tasty enough. I enjoyed their fried rice even though it was super laced with soy sauce, the shrimp in scallop sauce was bland and lastly, this is the most crucial as I have read yelpers praise their ravioli in peanut butter sauce, was gross. It was sweet and definitely NOT made with peanut butter.   To each their own, I suppose, but whoever liked their ravioli here better go to Kanda and order their dumpling in peanut-butter sauce: that shit's the best! Made with real peanut butter, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast service and the owners are the nicest people. Food is good and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Les prix sont raisonnables et le service est rapide. La soupe Tom yum aux crevettes étaient super bonnes. Seul point négatif: Il y avait vraiment trop de nouilles. Le Poulet Général tao aussi est un délice. Les portions sont généreuses pour l'ensemble des plats.   On aime!  Je recommande ce restaurant sans hésitation."}
{"text":"Un petit take-out vraiment satisfaisant et pas cher pantoute.   Mathématiquement parlant, les faits étaient les suivants:  4 filles 3 mets 8,25$/par personne 2 assiettes pleines chacune!  Diétetiquement parlant (lol), les plats étaient appétissants. La viande n'était pas \"bizarre\", les sauces étaient bonnes et abondantes, tout était chaud. Et surtout, tout était prêt à notre arrivée au restaurant, soit environ 20 minutes après notre appel.  Ce n'est pas du tout le Chinatown, mais pour des mets \"chinois-américains\" (semblent-ils qu'ils se veulent thaï?), c'est un endroit ok!"}
