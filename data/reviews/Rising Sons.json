{"text":"Truly surprised about the 4.5 star ratings from other reviewers. We had lunch there today and was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. The fried rice was flavorless, the spicy pho overly seasoned with sriracha. The massaman curry lacked flavor and was overly peppered with bamboo shoots. Even the appetizers (we ordered the sampler platter- spring roll, crab Rangoon, etc) were very average at best. Very disappointed with the quality of food especially after reading the reviews on Yelp"}
{"text":"This was actually good. I didn't like that they used bagged veggies instead of fresh, but it was good. It seemed to be run down at first but it's actually a neat little place. But note that they only accept cash or checks, no cards of any kind."}
{"text":"Great food! I got takeout and had the pho nam tok for lunch and had plenty left for dinner. Definitely going back for the kalapao!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Lao dishes, spicy papaya salad and sticky rice are the best in town! Small family run place!"}
{"text":"A little gem that's definitely worth a visit!  Stopped for lunch on our way through town. I had Penang curry which was excellent - fresh and the curry spice was spot on!  My wife had the drunken noodles which she said was some of the best she's ever had. She also had jasmine jasmine tea that she can't stop talking about. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Brought the family out for a late dinner during the week day. The restaurant is located in a nice plaza. Seemed to be limited parking because there is a local library in the vicinity.

Nice and clean atmosphere. Excellent customer service. My rating is based on the food...I would definitely give 5 stars for customer service. We ordered a ton. Sticky rice, chicken appetizers, ka poon (curry soup), chicken pad c ew, and Thai iced tea. Everything was delicious, but I don't think our chicken appetizers was fried very good. You could still see blood seeping. :( 

Not a big deal and I didn't complain. The gentleman working there included some extra sticky rice for my kids. Ka poon was excellent and the pad c ew was loaded with flavor. Thai iced tea tasted great. Would definitely give it another shot to try pad Thai.  

The restaurant seems to be good for small groups. Definitely an intimate atmosphere. I brought in two little ones so thought it was a little claustrophobic and echoey for my well behaved children *sacasm*."}
{"text":"Authentic Laotian and Thai-influenced dishes crafted by a husband and wife. Yup, this is a family business and they are wonderful people that take pride in their culture. Because it is just the two of them, do not expect fast food style service. If you have a large party, food will take a while because they do not compromise quality to be quick. The inside of the restaurant is a quiet, welcoming place with great decorative touches. 
Definitely recommend this place to others!

{"text":"Since coming to Madison, which a lot of people claim to be a foodie city, I struggled to find a number of international cuisines. I finally found good Indian food and Mexican food, and now I can say I found damn good Thai food that meets the expectations that were set while I lived in Chicago. Way better than the pan Asian food that is worshipped in other parts of this city. 

The Rising Sons has been around for 2 years now, taking place of some restaurant. I think what gets a lot of people is how small it looks from the outside. Maybe it just leads to some presumption of what you will get,  who knows. 

I enter the restaurant and was actually surprised by the amount of space in there. Probably a total of 30 to 40 patrons could be seated at all times. Pretty standard decor and the phrase \"upgraded ma and pop shop\" come to mind when I think of what I saw earlier today. The place was clean and cozy. I made a carry out order via Yelp and was coming to pick up.

I was greeted by a pleasant lady who let me know my order would soon be ready. We chatted and she did let me know some history of the place including that while business has been better, it seems that the West side of Madison has not yet caught on.

I brought my food home and unpacked the shrimp pad thai and chicken satay. The food was accompanied with crushed peanuts and peanut sauce/carrot cucumber salad respectively as traditionally done. Both dishes were piping hot and smelled fresh and reminiscently fragrant of the Thai food of restaurants I frequented in Chicago.

When taking my first bite of the pad thai I had a thrilling rush of flavor explosion followed by warmth in my soul. The food was fresh, authentic, and homemade. High quality ingredients were used and it tasted like it came from a traditional mother's kitchen. Hands down, real damn good.

All in all a great place that needs to be discovered. Hope it becomes the hit it deserves to be."}
{"text":"I know quite a few people who would never eat alone in a restaurant. I can't understand that. I am perfectly fine as long as I have something to read. So, I was running some errands and all of a sudden I had a deep hankering for Asian food. I used my handy dandy Yelp site and saw that the Rising Sun had a west side location. I had been to the State St restaurant a couple of times but that was quite a few years ago. The location took me out of the way but I never let a few miles get in my way.

It was 2:30 in the afternoon so the place was empty. I took a seat and reviewed the simple menu. Many items drew my attention. I was looking for a spicy dish and decided on the green curry with tofu. A few minutes later a bowl of deliciousness appeared. It included Asian eggplant, bamboo shoots, other veggies and plenty of tofu. I was also given some white rice. The serving size was just right. I cleaned my plate and walked away more than satisfied. The woman who waited on me was helpful and attentive. 

Although the restaurant is nowhere near my home, I am sure I will find my way back in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, and picked up food promptly. Our home is four minutes away and the food was so cold and tasteless. Total waste of eighty bucks. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Beef jerky is bomb. Chicken satay is fresh, veggies are beautifully flowered, and customer service is good. New fav Thai place."}
{"text":"This is authentic food. Service was great. The restaurant was empty but they were busy with plenty of take outs. Because we had to wait for a little while to be served, the owner was very apologetic and gave us a bigger portion of sticky mango rice. Her gesture was very sweet and sometimes that's all it takes to make the experiences of going to eat out pleasant. We had egg roll, spring roll, papaya salad, Pad Kapao, green curry. We ask her to make it spicy and and oh yeah she did. Just a tip- this is real authentic spicy so if you can't eat spicy make sure you order mild. We all loved it. Surely go again. So glad this place is on my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very intimate dining,  love the decor,  I had BBQ pork soup lunch menu, it was soooo good
Will be back"}
{"text":"We ordered a kalapao, a sweet steam bun, as an appetizer and I was disappointed to hear the microwave ding shortly before we were served a sad, deflated bun. The filling tasted great which meant it was at least homemade, but most likely it had been frozen and reheated. 
I ordered kao poun, vermicelli soup in red curry and coconut soup.  The broth threw me off as it was sweet and not the usual savory, salty, spicy broth I am used to. It still tasted good, just not similar to what I make at home, what my aunties make, and not what other Lao restaurants I have been to make. 
I'd give it another go since it is a good, convenient  option to have on the west side."}
{"text":"To me it was \"just ok\". Not bad,  not great. Restaurant cleanliness and service was good and friendly.  Serving size for the price is higher than some of the west side Thai places. The tofu appetizer was disappointing but the curry and noodle dish was good.  They do have some kick so order appropriately if you don't like spicy food. I'd recommend trying it in the long run as there is likely gems on the menu I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. The food looked good, but the portion of curry was a problem, and even the small rice container they gave was basically less than half full. Portions were small to the point that I felt insulted. I'm leaving three stars because they did refund my money (didn't even bother to eat it). Many other people have mentioned upsetting portion sizes when visiting there. This isn't king crab and truffle. Paying 10+ dollars for a measuring cup size portion of chicken, sauce, green beans plus a spoon of rice is a rip off."}
{"text":"Found the Rising Sons on Yelp with some pretty awesome reviews.  I thought the food was good - especially liked the crab Rangoons and Spring Rolls.  And for dessert - the Sticky Rice with ice cream was excellent.  

Bay, the owner, said that her first restaurant is still open and doing well downtown.  The picture on the menu showed a lovely garden seating area which Bay said is in the alley adjacent to the downtown store. I'll have to visit or you can give it a try and let me know. :)"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. The service was great and the food was even better. We had the sukiyaki soup and Pad Thai noodles with chicken."}
{"text":"Located on the west side of Madison Rising Sons is an adequate option for Thai food. We found the portions to be a little bit on the small side however the food was pretty good. We stopped in early in the afternoon so it wasn't really busy at all. There were only a few customers in the store because it was after the lunch rush. We both enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere was simple but nice. The wait staff was friendly and attentive... But there wasn't too many other customers there. Four stars for quality of food and freshness, but this place did not do anything to overly impressed me."}
{"text":"Tom Yum soup was ok but other food was just fair.  Chicken sate was tough. We were the only customers in the restaurant and had to ask for chop sticks, bill etc.  They served the wrong drink & after some dialogue were willing to make what my husband ordered.  Took the wrong drink away and just left it on the counter in the back to let the ice melt.  We prefer other Thai & Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"High expectations that just weren't met. There was no pho namtok available so I decided to order the papaya platter only to find out there was no sticky rice available. Not sure how a Thai/Lao cuisine can operate without sticky rice. So I decided to try the kao soy which wasn't terrible I just wasn't a big fan of the overall flavor of the soup itself. My wife ordered pad Thai and it was the dreaded slimy texture that you hope not to get when you order pad thai not to mention they forgot the green onions. Not going to comment on the customer service for there was only 2 people running the restaurant. I really wanted to like them but I just couldn't."}
{"text":"We went on a sunday at 5pm and it was closed...we went to seee a movie and came back at 7 pm cause I really wanted Thai food, i love thai food! And it was alright, nothing stood out from the 4 things we ordered  the aperizer sampler plate was unremarkable for its price, BBQ pork was dry but the veggies were nice and fresh, the drunken  noodles were okay ,the sesame e fried banana was not made fresh for sure.
I really wanted to love this place, but for the price you can get much better for less. The service was very good in must say but we came for good food too :("}
{"text":"People working there are really nice, good service, and the food was really good as well. I went there on Valentine's day, they gave me a rose and gave us free dessert (strawberry & mango cake) which was so good."}
{"text":"The food here is always GREAT! Recently, we catered from Rising Sons and the owner could not have been more amazing to work with. If you are looking to cater or just a great meal, Rising Sons is the place!"}
{"text":"Been to the State Street location several times this is my first time to the Westside location.The ambiance was nice, the restaurant was clean and the woman taking care of us was so sweet and gave us everything we needed even extras candies at the end of our meal. My coworker got the duck soup it's his favorite he absolutely loves it and I've tried it once it's really delicious if you like duck. I got the Mussamund curry with chicken. I loved it the chicken was tender and flavorful I love the combination of everything in it, red curry and coconut milk with vegetables I highly recommend it.   I've also had the spring rolls and appetizer platter enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Man, this was really disappointing.

My friends and I tried to grab a quick bite at Rising Sons before a movie. We walked in at 6:45 to a fairly empty restaurant. The appeared very understaffed as nobody greeted until a few minutes after deciding to seat ourselves. After about 15 minutes, the waitress took our drink orders. They must only have one blender because our bubble teas came out very slowly and one at a time. Instead of waiting for her to ask if we were ready to order food, we just asked her after the last person got their drink. Once the food order went in, service sped up to an acceptable speed, but we were already going to be late for our 7:45 movie at that point even with the trailers. Sure, maybe trying to grab dinner before a movie was a lofty goal, but the slow service really wasn't really a big deal compared to the food.

I got to try a lychee bubble tea, tom khem, and pad thai. The lychee bubble tea had a decent flavor with chunks of lychee, but the bubbles were hard and not chewy. The tom khem was a pork belly dish, so I was hoping for something more tender, but it was kind of just soupy, salty pork with some fat on it. The pad thai was some of the worst I've ever had. It had absolutely no complexity to it; it was almost like eating noodles and ketchup.

There are some solid places to get Thai food in Madison, but Rising Sons just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I really don't know why it took me so long to try this place, given that I drive past it twice a day, every day. So glad that I finally did!! My meat eating girl friend had the appetizer platter as her meal - crab Rangoon, egg roll, beef jerky, spring roll with pork, chicken satay. One of each item - she was pleased. It came with a sweet and sour sauce, and she requested some spring roll sauce after coveting mine - very good, savory and a good amount of crushed peanuts floating on top. I had the veggie version of the spring roll - not overly impressed...it was mostly iceberg lettuce. The sauce saved it. For my main, I got the veggie stir fry, and added shrimp. Wow. Goodbye take out from one of the many cookie cutter Chinese restaurants around - no comparison to this. Veggies were nice and crunchy, with a wonderful variety that you just don't see at other places. The lady at the table next door had a beautiful soup, which looked perfect for the chilly day - I'll try that next time if I am able to resist the veggie stir fry. The place was empty - just us and the soup lady, so hopefully this place sticks around, now that I've found my new favorite Asian fusion place!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! You walk in and the decor is dressed with beautiful Thai/Laos paintings and fabrics. Super friendly service and I love the family atmosphere! 

They have a big menu selection and a menu with pictures so it definitely helps! 

I ordered the Coconut Chicken Noodle with vegetables and it hits the spot for soup comfort food! I love the creaminess and sweet/spicy flavor. The vegetables are fresh and it is a good portion size to share if you want.

I also ordered the Mango Delight which has coconut sticky rice to die for! Mango was ripe and the presentation with a carrot rose was really cute!

I've been here a lot and tried multiple menu items here and at the downtown State Street location. I haven't gone wrong with any! My other favorites are the Beef Laab, Tom Yum Noodle, Crab Rangoons (filled to the fullest!), and Panang Curry."}
{"text":"Great home cooked Thai food and Laotian dishes. Noodles and curries are excellent. Wide variety of good Thai soups. Home made. Nice inside also good for carry out. A great business family run and always freshly cooked prepared to your liking!"}
{"text":"I had the Tom Yum with Noodles and Papa had L3. Now Papa loves everything, so it's hard to tell from his oooo's and ahhh's what's going on. And he attacks every dish like a starving lion, but today I was a starving lion too. The vermicelli noodles were done perfectly and the red curry broth was spicy sweet salty goodness. I can't wait to go back and try more fun noodle soups!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp while visiting Middleton, and wasn't disappointed. The owner was very friendly, and quick to give recommendations for their best meals. The crab Rangoon had a lot of filling and the sweet and sour sauce was the best I have had. The sauce has a bit of a chili type flavor to it. The pad Thai and drunken noodles were also very good."}
{"text":"Great find on the greater Westside of Madison and Middleton neighborhood. The menu was surprising large for even for a Thai restaurant but offers some dishes not often seen in other restaurants. For my money it's the best Thai restaurant on the Westside hands down. While we sat down at a table, it seems like this place does a much bigger carry-out business. 

My measuring stick at a Thai restaurant is the squash curry and it measures up here. The Drunken Noodles were also great. We also had a curious dessert which was surprisingly simple yet tasty - warm sticky rice topped with vanilla ice cream, a little whipped cream and a drizzle of strawberry sauce."}
{"text":"Really not good. The people are nice but wow the food is barely edible. We ordered 3 dishes to try and we ended up not eating any of them. Too bad, wanted to find another tasty Thai place but this is definitely not it."}
{"text":"Friendly mom-and-pop Thai/Laotian on the west side.  Only one of the curries was listed as \"spicy\", and when I asked the server if that was the spiciest curry they had he said \"no-- you want a spicy curry?  We'll make you a spicy curry!\" (so that's what I got-- and it was just like I wanted it!)

With the demise of Suwanasak this is probably the best Thai food you'll find on the west side."}
{"text":"Friendly staff recommended drunken noodle. I chose pork. I'm so glad I listened. So darn good!"}
{"text":"So I believe that this place is an extension of the popular Rising Sons Deli store on State Street...this kinda scared me at first, because I honestly was not that big of a fan of Rising Sons Deli. HOWEVER, I would like to give this place 4.5 stars if I could (Maybe a 5 if I return a few more times and they continue to impress me?), because this was muuuuch better than Rising Sons Deli on State. 

I got the Drunken Noodles, Thai Tea, and we ordered some mango pudding for dessert. All of this was pretty high quality Thai food! I was also impressed by their expansive menu, which includes some Vietnamese/Chinese dishes (although I'd probably stick with their Laotian/Thai food). 

Unfortunately, it seems like no one really knows about this place given it's tiny amount of reviews. I would like to signal boost this place since I think it's one of the better Thai options near the Middleton/West Towne Mall area. Check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"A true gem! Wonderful dishes come out of this kitchen. 
Everything was amazing. This is the real thing, folks!"}
{"text":"Great family run Lao/Thai spot on the west side.  Staff are courteous and friendly - great pad krapao, lots of vegetables and it's fire!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great meal! And at very good prices. Sure, the menus are old and torn, the napkins come out of a plastic box... but hey, this is an excellent place for poor students to have an Excellent sit-down meal.

If you get the fried banana for desert (which I highly recommend) ask for chocolate syrup with it"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and ordered the beef laab both times. It was extremely flavorful and always hits the spot! The flavor is consistent and I always have a little bit of left over to take home and enjoy later. I also tried the ka poun the last time I was in. Athough it tasted differently, everyone makes their ka poun differently. It has a sweeter and sour taste to it, which I'm not use to, but I still ate the whole bowl. Their thai iced coffee is amazing!!!! My first time trying thai iced coffee and I was very pleased. The service is nice and friendly. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this, but I didn't. The service was good, but the food was seriously lacking. Now, maybe I made a bad choice as far as what I ordered--it's entirely possible. I had the bbq pork lunch special. Eight dollars. What I got for those eight dollars was an ice cream scoop of rice, some lackluster carrots and broccoli, a sad rangoon, and a quantity of bright red, very dry and tough pork. Enough pork to fill a child's size 4T shoe. I ate it because I was hungry, but I did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food was good, the staff was nice. But the portions are very small.... Went there for lunch with a friend and spent 35 dollers before tip and left hungry. We even got a appetizer.... I wouldnt recomend eating here if you want to leave with a full belly."}
