{"text":"Front area is a complete storage area for junk. No price list, it looks like they make it up according to who is ordering. I bought a small oxtail and rice and it was nearly $12. I could not stay and eat because the A/C was not on and it was like an oven inside. Food was bland...no love. Would not be going back to here again."}

Authentic Jamaican food. 
Only negative is they should be open longer on weeknights and Sunday."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this hidden gem. The food is fantastic and the service is very friendly."}
