{"text":"Went on a Friday night and used a Groupon.  
There were pros and cons to our experience but overall the food was excellent and the service was personal and friendly.
Since it reopened as Maries (from Marie Calendars) You can see they are struggling a bit to get customers in.  It was closed for quite a while in the transition.  As such they don't seem to be able to stock everything on the menu in adequate supply.  A sign in the lobby says 'full service bar opening soon'. 
The portions of food were large.  The pork pot roast with garlic potatoes and green beans were all cooked to perfection.  The Rhubarb Strawberry pie was awesome.

I hope they manage to stay in business.  They should do coupons in local newspapers.
I felt in terms of food we got what we paid for."}
{"text":"With the help of the reviews on Yelp & the purchase of a Groupon we went to this new place for dinner on Mother's Day. Lovely place. Lots of pies on the Menu, but very few available. We were told some of the items we ordered were not available. That was disappointing as they waited till we went through the menu to order & then got back saying it was not available.
The food was great & tasted so good. The mashed potato was lovely. Most of the desserts we re not available. The same again, after we ordered we were told they had no more & we had to think about new things to order. That was not too good. other than that everything else was Super.
Will go there again & Will encourage more people to go there. The pies are the best."}
{"text":"Food was good but  was slightly overpriced considering the service. This was the second and last time we're coming here. Customer service is not a priority here. We were seated right away because there was a lot of tables available. Took a while for someone to take our order, while waiting we finished our $2.50 coffee and no one ever offered any refill, (and bring your own spoon if you take cream/sugar, they don't seem to like to give those out) When our pancakes and waffles came, they didn't bring any butter or syrup. Waited another 5 minutes for someone to come by so we can ask for it. The syrup was brought out in a small soup bowl, with syrup dripping all over the sides! We were done with our meal by the time the waitress came again so we asked for the check. She brought us the check and realized we were being charged for something extra we didn't order. They did take it off at the register but still, won't return. We would've brought home leftovers but didn't want to wait another 10 minutes to ask someone for a box."}
{"text":"I'm not certain how this place will stay in business...maybe the hotels around it will help. We've given Marie's 3 chances - each time I went there was a laundry list of items that they were out of or their 'pie guy' didn't show up to make the pies. Prices a bit expensive for very bland food. I had high hopes for this place......"}
{"text":"So, we tried the new place that went into the old Marie Callendar's place. Coincidence they have similar naming from the old spot? Hmm.... Waitress said they are not associated. I did try looking up their website on the menu, but not sure if it's up yet.
Since we try to help out & eat local, we thought to give this spot a try.  We tried the chicken Alfredo, pork pot roast & chicken tenders. Food was good, nothing uber fabulous, but it tasted decent. They do have a salad bar for those looking for a simple salad bar. 
They also do have fresh pies. Several flavors I haven't seen before. I think they are doing a soft opening to see how it goes. Not sure when they will do a grand opening."}
{"text":"Oh goodness, we should've known better when we got to the place and there was literally one car in the parking lot, probably someone who works there, and when we got inside, there was not one customer. The whole time we were there, we remained the only patrons. The place looked the same as it did when it was Marie Calenders, but that was the only thing similar. The entire restaurant had an odd smell to it, something we couldn't shake the entire time, it was just jarring. The service was definitely sub-par, the waitress seemed unsure of everything she was saying, and the food itself was way too pricey. The food came out quick enough, which was expected since no one else was there, but when it arrived my stomach practically turned. I ordered biscuits and gravy, that came with three eggs, the eggs were okay, but the gravy looked awful, huge chunks of broken up sausage piled on top of a biscuit- looked as good as it tasted, which isn't good at all. Very salty. My grandma had the pancakes with an egg on the side, she only ate half of one and was very unimpressed. We were in and out of there in twenty minutes, 30 dollars later. We won't be going back. My stomach is hurting just thinking of the place. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"WOW...one of the worst restaurant experiences. 
We only went there due to Mimi's Cafe at Ray Rd.  being closed. 
Very disappointed with the service. Not sure if the waitress was new, but first of all, she handed us the complete menu, which included lunch, however, when we went to order, only THEN did she inform us that only breakfast was being served at the time. She did not say that upon arrival. Then after we ordered, we waited about 30 minutes to get our food. None of the meals should've taken that long. Then the waitress didn't even bother to ask if everything was ok until we were halfway through the meal. Toast was supposed to accompany one of the meals, yet was received 15 minutes afterward. VERY poor timing. Also, the waitress didn't know what pies were available.  She returned with a list of what they DIDN'T have, which was about a 1/3 of the pies listed on the menu. It is not surprising that the restaurant was fairly empty. In it's particular location, right off the freeway and surrounded by hotels, you would think they would've been a lot busier at brunch time (11:00-11:30am) on a Sunday. The waitress was pleasant, but seemed very new, which is ok, however, for the lack of tables in the restaurant, it could've been better. 
We will most likely not return.
Perhaps, because they're relatively new, they're still working out the kinks, but enough time has passed that those should've already been worked on. 
Oh yeah, and beware of the water system that waters the shrubs surrounding the building. They were on when we arrived, and spraying out into the parking lot, so our shoes had to get wet on the way in. They remained on for the duration of our visit, and were still running as we left almost 2 hours later. What a waste of water....IN THE SUMMER..."}
{"text":"4.4.14, decided to check out the new place for lunch. Interior decor is beautiful, the servers were attentive but......
I ordered the patty melt and my wife ordered the chicken pot pie, the patty melt came with a patty of meat so thin and small that I laughed and blurted out \" Where's the Beef!!!\" Plus it was bleeding, I ordered it med. well, they cooked a new one quick enough but for $11.00..... No Way!!
     The Potpie looked delicious, had plenty of chicken and veggies but I thought the sauce was bland though my wife liked it.  The biggest sin though was the fact the manager didn't come by and acknowledge my issue with the food, that brought it down from 3 stars to 2 stars.  We'll try back in 3 months to see if they've improved, till then, no recommendations"}
{"text":"Well, my first clue should have been that I was the only customer on a Saturday morning at 9:30...normally a busy breakfast time. Being local, I really wanted to love the place, and waited a month after opening before I tried it. One of the worst experiences ever as far as food goes-$9.25 for huevos rancheros?!?!?! A bean, pepper and potato mix on top of a fajita, then all topped with eggs. Fajita was inedible after sitting under those veggies for a few minutes. No surprise that the place was empty..."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok, but overpriced ($9.50 for a turkey sandwich). Pie is the main reason I go to a place like this, and their pie menu is extensive.., but they don't actually have most of them (maybe 30 on the menu but only 5 or 6 available). I was there for Saturday lunch, and there was only one other table occupied. The interior hasn't been updated since it was Marie Callendar's, and has an off-putting musty odor. I was hoping for something a little more modern and fresh. But the pie was good :-)"}
{"text":"Looks like Marie Calendars again... so glad!  missed the pies"}
{"text":"Wasn't very busy when we came in, but it was right by the hotels we had family staying at. Marie's may not have had fine dining service, but the hospitality, menu options, and quantity served gives it the 4 stars I'm rating.

Go in on a MONDAY!! For $10-16 dollars, you can order an entree meal that comes with two generous portioned sides (your choice) AND an appetizer salad AND a slice of pie. The meal was so huge I had to take the rest home.

It's such a great deal and the food is pretty on point to where I'm not sure why they don't get more customers. I think the location may play a role in this, but anyone staying at the hotels surrounding the place or living in the area should go here to get the biggest bang for their buck!"}
{"text":"Marie's continues on almost exactly where Marie Calendars left off. Same building; almost the same name. Same sort of menu too: family, casual dining fare, but with lots of pies. I'd say the quality may have improved slightly, but the good points were hit-and-miss combined with that bad points."}
{"text":"OMG!!!   I bought a groupon, so okay we will try it out.  They do not open til 8am.   Not a car one in the parking lot!    Its 9 am, We ordered food, took about 8 min.  The 3 egg breakfast was short 2 eggs, and the scrambeled eggs are from a liquid egg product, not fresh scrambeled.  They were horrible!  The sausage links had nooo flavor!   The bacon was okay, for deep fried.  The potato choice varies daily so you have to ask.  The coffee was good.  Overall, don't waste your money"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great people, yummy food and the environment is friendly. The servers would constantly make us smile. The pie is, of course, excellent as well!!

Would recommend trying it out and giving it a shot :-)"}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the least. Wish Marie Callendars were back. Came to try it out because they were on Groupon, $12 for $22. Wish I had my $12 back. I'm giving this a 1-star only because the service (omlette bar and server) was good and the mashed potatoes were pretty good. Sunday Bruch breakdown: breakfast potatoes were burnt to a crisp, gravy from the biscuits were burnt (not appearance) but rather the taste and there is little selection. I asked 2 different servers what kind of soup was on the salad bar and both couldn't figure it out by looking at it-yikes!  My husband liked the fruit, omlette and waffle. Pie slice portion was very small.  Sad to say we wont be coming back. This place needs Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Ask for Laney! Sarcastic and fun made our Sunday breakfast enjoyable. Ranchos huevous was phenomenal, best I ever had! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I know that's quite a charge, but it is well deserved. 

we were tempted to leave when we arrived and were greeted by an empty restaurant with an overpriced ($21!!) omelette bar. When my son touched the rail next to some stairs his hands came off black!

We say down anyway. We ordered some omelettes and French toast and asked if we could substitute anything for the potatoes and toast (we are eating low carb). The waitress offered bacon and fruit instead.

the omelettes were poor to mediocre. Bell peppers were used instead of \"green chiles.\" The cheese tasted cheap. Definitely not worth $9.50. Any hotel buffet omelette is better.

Then we get the bill, they charged us $3 for each bacon substitute ($3 for 2 slices of bacon as a 'substitute'?!) and $3 for each little fruit bowl that had been offered as a substitute! Also, whipped cream was added to my daughter's French toast, a nice touch but something we didn't order and we were charged for that too. So two omelettes and French toast came to $40! 

After much harassment and lecturing from a very rude  manager she agreed to remove the extra charges after I adamantly stated that I would not pay for what I did not order. 

We left unimpressed with the food, disgusted by the service, and understanding why the restaurant was empty. I don't think we have to worry about them staying in business for very long."}
{"text":"We used to go to Marie Calendar's when it was here for their Sunday Brunch. We were glad to see it was back open as \"Maries\". 

The brunch was not as good, but was acceptable. I am assuming they are still working out the kinks. Had to ask for butter and syrup for the pancakes. Wish they had regular cubed hash browns too. For $21 (or $22) for brunch, it's too expensive. The times we ate there we used a Groupon. In my opinion, the Brunch should be no more than $15.

We plan to go there for Mothers Day dinner because we are pretty sure we wont have to wait for a table."}
