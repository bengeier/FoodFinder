{"text":"Amazing food and the staff are great. True New Yorkers doing their thing. Steve's sandwiches are to die for."}
{"text":"Decided to try after seeing a movie. Had the meatball parmesan..delish! Took a whoppie sampler home for dessert, and can see why they sell out! Owner was super nice, too.. prefer supporting a family owned business! Going back soon for breakfast:)"}
{"text":"My new favorite in town! The food is very fresh and is always delicious. They don't skimp on meats like some places do. Fair prices and quick service with a huge menu. The only problem I've had is that I tend to want to go here for most meals instead of cooking at home!"}
{"text":"Always looking for great places to enjoy a bite to eat...this definitely fit the bill. Friendly staff, clean and great tasting food. I had the chicken bacon wrap special. Savory chicken, crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes and bacon cooked perfectly. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's a sliver of a place but the food is on point. The spot is tiny but they have a huge selection. We lived in NJ for 16 years so seeing Taylor ham again was a treat.  Inexpensive with an enormous selection - the deli meats are phenomenal. If you're interested in something besides the standard fare (the Hickory Grill next door has consistently failed to impress me) this is a great choice."}
{"text":"in a word just eat. ..always friendly and food is New York move over everyone they are on their way up. .and help our local High Schools with spirit nights and local sports. ...thanks to all of you"}
{"text":"Sandwich was okay.  The service was unbelievable slow.  We sat and sat waiting for two simple sandwiches to be made.    I hope they work on that because it's nice to have another place to grab lunch or breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"Great food authentic freshly handmade. The owner is super nice and prepares food however you like."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and service is friendly they make you feel like family... everything I've eaten there is top notch make think of places back in Jersey ... and the bake goods are worth going for... by the slice or just want a sub or a cannoli this place is it!!!!! Oh did mention they do breakfast!!!! Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the turkey wrap, was very good. Staff was friendly too. Will definitely go back. Good kids menu too."}
{"text":"Went into sileo's on Monday for lunch and got the Chicken Parm sandwich.  The sandwich was average at best.  The chicken was a little chewy for my liking.  I like a chicken parm that has a crunch to it.  It was definitely decent. Because I ate the whole thing but it wasn't my favorite.  I was in Sileo's a couple weeks ago and had an amazing turkey club.  Couldn't believe how much turkey they put on the sandwich.  I could barely get my mouth around it.  I will continue to visit and try different menu items."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Italian sausage sub! Meatball sub! Love it. Will definitely be back. Oh, and the desserts! Already thinking about next time."}
{"text":"Delicious!! They have these rainbow cakes my uncle made and they were incredible! So glad to have a deli/restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place! The food was fantastic and the people working were very friendly and knowledgeable. I came over to eat lunch with my brother and now I wish that this restaurant was on my side of town in Ballantyne so I could come more often. Looking forward to coming here again sometime! I had the Italian sandwich and the cold cuts tasted fresh and the bread was nice and soft. The sandwich with stuffed to the gills. I didn't really need a side because the sandwich was so big! Fantastic place and feels great to support a local business!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, even better service! These guys really know how to make you feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Was getting my car worked on and decided to give this little place a try. I'm so glad I did! While the place is small the food they serve is not. You have a plethora of options to choose from, I don't know if I'll ever be able to try it all.  The flavor is robust and delicious! Cant wait to go back and try something else. They also don't skimp on desert if you have a sweet tooth. Do yourself a favor and try this place out, seriously, it's fantastic and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great place. Love the chicken parm and Taylor ham egg and cheese. My wife really enjoyed their Philly and mother in law said the reuben was great! The staff is very friendly and always put the customer first. This is a great little spot in a very convenient location."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!! For breakfast, definitely try the Taylor ham, egg, and cheese! You won't be disappointed with anything from here!"}
{"text":"had a great breakfast there - good quantities of good quality at a good price! will be back for a Taylor ham egg and cheese on a good seeded roll!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome you get more than what your money's worth fast,friendly and the environment is very comforting."}
{"text":"If you want a true taste of NYC...Then make your way over to this place. AWESOME food and owners."}
{"text":"Best NY style food around. Great food. Great customer service. If you haven't tried there food or desserts your truly missing out!"}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich EVER!!  My wife and I stopped in after a movie at Sun Valley 14 and Wow!!  We will be back Many Times!!!"}
{"text":"Started off with a simple menu choice: chili dog and their home fries. Both were pretty good. This is a small place and it quickly filled up when were there. Service was good. I will try the Philly cheese steak next time."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I had the Taylor ham egg and cheese on an everything bagel and it was perfect NY style. My wife had the Italian sub and we took half of it home because it was so packed. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Sileo's NY Deli. I've had his Reuben sandwich and the Taylor Ham / Pork Roll twice and loved them all. They also happen to have the best Cajun potato chips made, the Crawtaters. Every time I go in there, he's got some new Italian treat to try and they are awesome as well. Steve listens to all of his customers and makes everything to your liking. He's also a great ambassador for the local community.  Give him a call @ (704) 776-4340."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this place I have been going TONS of time.. philly cheese and the Italian sub are AMAZING ... don't let me get started on breakfasts and most importantly customer service.  Steve is the best and so friendly! I have my family and friends hooked on this place.  It's clean great vibe ... oh and their desserts OMG!"}
{"text":"Stop! Wait! Look very, very closely and before you choose either of its two behemoth neighbors - Hickory Tavern or American Burger - that it is wedged (and somewhat hidden) between, give this authentic little NY style deli a try. On each of our visits, we were greeted by its enthusiastic do-it-all owner who obviously loves his business. The dining area is a little tight but immaculate and comfortable. A large poster on the wall makes it crystal clear who the boss is - you, the customer. The entire restaurant glistens and had a 100 sanitary rating during this visit, another indicator of pride of ownership.  A full array of burgers, sandwiches and wraps are available. The Philly Cheese Steak Hoagie and triple decker sandwiches are terrific as are the sides. They also serve up perfectly prepared breakfasts any time of the day.   On this trip, we went with the Italian hoagie and the turkey wrap with a side of fries. Both sandwiches were fresh, stuffed full of quality cold cuts and tasty (and ran about $8 each.) Unfortunately the the bread was unspectacular, which as my readers know, is a pet peeve of mine.  The fries were piping hot and delicious, but be warned they start at $2.50 for a small order. Adding in a couple of fountain drinks, our total tab came to $24 without tip, which is comparable to its more affluent neighbors. The place was packed and the service was okay even though no one offered to refill our drinks.  A wide selection of tempting desserts are also on display. The black and white cookieos were very enticing; however, I once again chose a couple of rainbow squares at 50 cents each and once again the edges were hard and they did not taste fresh so I cannot recommend the desserts (but I will keep trying.)  I plan to try the Reuben and a Black & White on my next visit. At this point,  although not a Gotta Try, it is a legitimate 4 stars and I have not regretted by-passing its better known neighbors."}
{"text":"Great Philly-style bread for the subs.  We had a Philly cheese steak and the chicken parm and we're very happy. Even the pickle was good. The vegetables are cut fresh to order. They have a huge dessert case so we sampled a variety of Italian cookies, cannoli, cheesecake, brownie cake, pumpkin whoopie pie and coffee cake. They have specials every day and Wednesday they had half price pizza slices which was a terrific deal for the family. The owner is very friendly and personable. He went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Most addictive Philly cheesesteak ever! You can't get sandwiches this good, this fast anywhere! Also, one of the best reuben sandwiches you'll find! I highly recommend the Taylor ham, egg and cheese sandwiches as well. The meats are cut so thin, and stacked high so flavor is maxed!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic NY style sandwiches. Great bread and desserts. Desserts are either from a local bakery or shipped straight from NY. Friendly staff and casual atmosphere full of Yankees memorabilia and NY photos."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. However, expectations and reality don't always meet. I ordered off of their specials board outside that had the chicken philly listed as a combo which included fries and a drink for $10. I received my mediocre at best sandwich with fries. When I went to check out I was charged for the fries as well. When I asked regarding this I was told that was only for one of their specials even though their board had it listed at the bottom as if it applied to all. Will not go back for below average food and false advertising."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast or lunch. Stopped in the other day for breakfast. Got a sesame bagel with taylor ham and cheese, and some potato wedges. My wife got a breakfast wrap, and she loved it. Mine was outstanding. They also have some great desserts that they ship in straight from New York. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Still considered worst place to eat.  Food is bad and old, and never fresh.  Worst customer support and they ownership is shady."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  They accidentally charged my card twice and when I called back the next day, they were kind enough to give me the refund no questions asked, in cash.  If you go, try the Steve's Special...super good sandwiches.  I'll take them over the big corp sandwhich shop guys anyday!"}
{"text":"Love the food here every time I visit.  The owner and staff are so friendly. Great NY food.  The hot dogs and the Bacon and egg on a roll are my favorate.  My husband loves the Ruben."}
{"text":"My kids and I were regulars here. They have a breakfast menu that is served anytime. The pancakes are sublime. Kids love the pizza slices. I am a fan of the Philly Cheese steak and Pastrami Cheese Sandwich. Absolutely addictive. They offer great daily specials. A great dine-in space that is eclectic focusing on New York memorabilia. Can get very busy in the afternoons but worth the wait. We will miss visiting."}
{"text":"If you miss a NY deli, look no further!  The owner Steve takes pride in his food and caters to his customers with friendliness, NY authenticity and delicious dishes.  The decor will make you feel like your at home.  Secret gem in the heart of Sun Valley!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Reuben is too die for! Must try for lunch! Breakfast is excellent as well!!!!@"}
{"text":"Great subs, and hotdogs. Trying to find something bad but just can't mustard it. Try the Taylor ham egg and cheese on a Bagel. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Finally went for our first visit and Oh My Gosh! The food was amazing! I had the antipasta which took me back to my childhood! I haven't had a salad that good in years! My husband had the Cajun chicken wrap. It had just the right amount of everything on it! It was perfect! The atmosphere was great everyone was so friendly! We will definitely be coming back more often!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited \"Silo's\" this afternoon for the very first tine. I have to report that the experience was a very sad one. The best part about the visit was the young man (15 yrs. old) he was more professional and courteous than the adults. They can actually learn \"customer service\" etiquette from him. Here are the details of my horrible visit.  There was another couple dining at the same time as my wife and I, they were white and we are black. The lady that works in Silo's would pass our table constantly to offer refills on their drinks and to make sure they were enjoying their meal.Only time she would say anything to my wife and I, was when I would summon here to our table before she dashed back behind the counter. One of her many trips to their table, the female worker even suggested dessert to the white couple, then hurried back behind the counter without offering my wife and I desert.  If that behavior wasn't bad enough, the owner who was cooking, came from behind the counter, walked past my wife and to share a story about the establishment next door. He walked over to the table with the white couple, shared his story and a laugh, then walked past our table without so much as an 'eye contact' and returned behind the counter.   As for my dinner, the taste was very bland. There was plenty of meat on my 'Philly Cheese Steak' however it lacked any kind of taste. Here's the finally to the whole discriminatory service we received. As I payed for my meal, my hand accidentally touched her hand during the exchange of money. The white female worker then wiped her hand on her cloths as if I were a diseased Infested person or that the blackness of my skin was hazardous. \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\". That was the first and last time I will ever frequent a bias establishment that displays discriminatory practices.   It's apparent that this is the culture of this 'mom and pop' shop located next to Sun Valley 14 theater, I only hope that their ignorant, bias, 1960's behavior doesn't affect the 15 yrs old young man, because he has a bright future ahead of him!!! I'm speaking from professional experience of 20 yrs. in the role of Sr. Customer Service Manager for various fortune 100 companies!!"}
{"text":"just moved to Charlotte and man was this a great taste of home!! The owner was super friendly and you could tell that this place is his baby. My boyfriend and I split a philly cheesesteak and an italian sandwich. Both were phenomenal. The owner was attentive to our needs and very friendly. He brought us our food and told us to pay at the end. It made me feel like his friend lol. This place somehow has everything. While we were there, fresh cannolis came out of the oven. Someone else came in and got pizza. Is there anything this man CANT do?!?!?! Not all heroes wear capes. Unfortunately I live in north charlotte so I cant frequent this spot a lot BUT if I'm in the area you can best believe I will return!!!! As they say in Sileo's, the customer is king, and this man sure makes me feel like royalty.  Please support this business."}
{"text":"Great fast friendly service. I stopped in to grab lunch to go. I got the Italian & it was Fabulous!  Bread was soft & fresh. Meat & cheese was fresh & had a great taste! I'm not a New Yorker, but I like the food!! A must stop if you're in the area. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast this morning and I have to say,  Awesome!!!!!!!!  Taylor Ham (Pork Roll in Philly) and egg and cheese sandwich.  I've found my Saturday morning breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Best Reuben Sandwich in Indian Trail, NC. I eat here at least twice a month and always eat The Reuben with macaroni salad and a V8 tomato juice, they always get it Right"}
{"text":"The truth is that Charlotte has a lot of transplants to this great city. If your from the northern side of this country you will DEFINITELY appreciate the authentic flair and flavor of this local delicatessen. The owner brings in favorites from New York and has the favorites that blow old York out of the water! See Steve for open faced knishes, black and white cookies and all the accompanying flavor the the Big Apple has to offer!"}
{"text":"Solid dining experience at Sileo's after a movie next door (well, almost next door). We had stopped in on a prior visit to the movies, and they had a few more tables filled, and on that visit, found that the service was a bit slower - so your own experience may vary. As a small business - and a relatively small location - it is understandable that there is not a packed house of employees, so it is just something to be aware of when dining here.  Once you are served, however, the experience is fine - the service is friendly, and the food comes out quickly to boot. For such a small location, there are also plenty of options on the menu (though this might be an issue - many delis may only provide a handful of sandwiches, with a few variations)."}
{"text":"Love to dine here w/my boys.  The owner is so nice and friendly and the food is great.  It really reminds me of another NY deli we use to go to when we were stationed in Groton.  It's a cute little restaurant w/great service and great food."}
{"text":"Local owned and operated restaurant, ordered the philly, it was pretty tasty.  The meat was perfect and the veggies were awesome.  Keep in mind if you want a subway priced sub you won't get it here and for good reason.  The meats, veggies, bread are all fresh and tasty.  Kids got the cheese pizza, it was New York style and they said they loved it as well.  Huge assortment of bakery items, the brownies were out of this world.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other sandwiches and even breakfast here."}
{"text":"This place never fails on quality! The sandwich may be pricy,  but worth it! I've been impressed how friendly the management has been when I visit.  Tons of options and irresistible baked goods. It's a gem in the sun valley plaza next to the movie theater."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here after seeing a movie and we absolutely loved it!  We both got the Rueben, fries and a drink and the rueben was out of the world!  The owner was there, greeted us, explained the menu and was full of energy which was also great.  Many times you go to a restaurant and feel as though the workers do not wish to be there.  He was wonderful!  Will definitely be going back and trying other menu items including the homemade pastries."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem near the Sun Valley movie theater.  Great food at a great price!  Has a very New York vibe, I love the atmosphere here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Top notch place - the real deal!  I've had their Chef salad, knish, egg salad, coffee, buttered roll, Philly cheesesteak, chicken cutlet salad and every one is awesome!  The owner is so friendly and customer oriented ...definitely my new favorite place!  Let's keep this place in business!!"}
{"text":"Best Taylor ham egg and cheese sandwich ever.  Pancakes are better then pancake houses. Good family owned restaurant where the owner cooks the food from the heart."}
{"text":"Love Sileos!  This place makes amazing food and no matter what you pick it is gonna be good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this nice little Deli and I was amazed at how big the hamburgers were that they gave you and the prices are very very competitive I would certainly suggest this place to someone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"First of all, they have gone to the trouble to have both Coke and Pepsi products. Service was very good."}
