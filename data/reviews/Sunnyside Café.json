{"text":"A great place for a cheap but tasty breakfast.  The people that work here are so sweet and kind. I tend to get the full breakfast ($6) when I go or the jumbo breakfast ($10) if really hungry. You pay beforehand and then they will bring the food to you.  Great sunny patio after noonish.  Highly suggested place"}
{"text":"Agree with the first review: can't beat their basic breakfast for the price. Eggs, a choice of bacon or sausage, home fries, optional salad, toast, coffee. Nothing fancy but tasty, fresh and cooked well. I've had it several times and it's always the same. Never burnt, never undercooked. It has to be the cheapest breakfast in town.   This is not a 'hip' joint so if you're looking to show off your latest designer clothes, this isn't the place for that. The decor could be described as non decor. There aren't many seats, the furniture is clean and well kept but can't even be described as kitschy or campy, it's that bland. They do, however, have a flat screen that displays a slide show of images of their own food, which I enjoy.  The average patron appears to be someone looking for a simple meal for a very low price they do have a patio in the summer.   You might also enjoy ordering the breakfast: you get a laminated menu with checkboxes next to each item and a marker and you mark off each item you would like. Don't know if other meals are ordered this way or if it's just breakfast but it adds some interest to the experience."}
{"text":"Closed permanently as of Wednesday, 28th of May 2014 (yesterday). It was a clean restaurant with value priced all-day breakfast. This Ma & Pa shop will be missed. Found out the hard way that they closed as I was trying to get a late breakfast this morning. No reason given for the closing, but they did put a thank you note to its customers on the front door. The Junction is poorer for their closing."}
{"text":"Excellent bfast special bacon eggs toast homefries and large coffee for under 8 dollars.  Great padio good  cheap eats!"}
{"text":"The other reviews are right on target. Sunnyside has delicious, simple breakfast.  The ladies running the place take a lot of pride in keeping the place neat, as well as working feverishly to cook and serve you.  1. The place is tight, but you can usually find a seat in the window or a table, provided your party is less than four. 2. The bargain breakfast gives you choices of meat, how you like your eggs cooked, home fries, and an optional salad, along with toast. 3. unfortunately, they do not serve French toast or pancakes. I would also love to see grits, but know that's not going to happen. 4. They take debit cards, but no credit cards. 5. This place is the anti-hip, which is probably what makes it so great."}
