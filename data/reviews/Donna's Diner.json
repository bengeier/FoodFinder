{"text":"Cleveland is stuffed to the gills with diners. They're not all good, either, much less great. I consider myself very fortunate to have found the best one in town, at least as far as I have experienced. Donna has your typical, predictable diner fare.. but it tastes like the world's most comforting grandmother cooked it. Anthony Bourdain would drool for this place! Donna herself is a gem, she's outgoing, with plenty of common sense, and not afraid of expressing herself. You'll be glad you paid her a visit."}
{"text":"This place is not closed. I ate lunch there today.

The food here is really good. I recommend the Italian Burger. Service was a little slow today. When you only get an hour for lunch, waiting 30+ minutes for your food doesn't give you much time to enjoy it. I'm hoping today was just a one-off."}

{"text":"This is a great little diner. The food is strait forward home cooking. I had the fried chicken (Real homemade). Excellent price and I couldn't finish it and took the rest home. The service was good. I have been here a few times and the only down side is that the coffee is gross."}
