{"text":"Just 4 days after opening and staff was super gracious.  Food was incredibly fresh.  Menu depth is being developed as they build business but everything was beautifully fresh.  These guys have potential to dominate the sushi business on Yonge St.  I didn't order off menu - sat at sushi bar and asked them to be creative - was not disappointed at any level.  From custom made hand rolls to fresh tuna sashimi it was all spot on.  Get there for lunch and/or dinner - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"LONG wait times, and bad food. My coworkers and I walked in and ordered the lunch specials. We were told to come back in 20 minutes to pick up the food. We come back in 20, and ended up waiting another 40 minutes. So in total, we waited 1 hour for our food. And the waitress' excuse, sorry its kind of busy. The restaurant was half full, and had a maximum of 20 customers. 

Then, after we Finally got our food, well past our lunch hour, we ate it up at our office. My coworker had diarrhea for the rest of the afternoon, while I just felt nauseous.

Never going back again."}

As it is off the Yonge Street strip, not a lot of people seem to know about this place, so we had the full attention of the server, who was very nice and quick. It also made the spot quieter than your usual lunch spot, so more peaceful and relaxing. Ahh.

It is raised above the street level, so after you walk in, you also must walk a few steps up, into a really nice modernly decorated room. The seats are in a mod-looking black and white fabric, lots of cool vases and other decorative pieces are scattered about. It's a very stylish space. 

This place is a wine and sake bar, but that part of the menu is ignored at lunchtime. A reminder to check it out after work!

Had the sashimi special with miso soup and salad, and everything was really good. The soup tasted fresh and not excessively salty like miso often is, the salad had a lovely presentation with the usual orange dressing and the addition of some sesame seeds scattered across. The sashimi pieces were generous and very fresh tasting. 

I will definitely return, as this is an oasis of calm and good service in an otherwise busy work day."}
