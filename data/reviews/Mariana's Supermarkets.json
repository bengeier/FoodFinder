{"text":"On our way back home we stopped by the Market. I was glad they had Vegan options. There's a little restaurant or food court inside. They have a Juice Bar and a delicious $3.99 Chopped fresh fruit salad great for breakfast! The Passion Fruit juice they make is amazing!"}
{"text":"Uno, Dos, Tres, Delicious!!  Mariana's is the best place in the valley to shop for authentic Mexican food and goods.  There is a huge selection of snacks, fresh produce, tortillas, meats, and home supplies here.    I stop in most mornings before work for some Aloe Juice or something from the incredibly quenching fresh juice bar they have.  My favorite treat from Mariana's is the Cucumber Aqua Fresca, which is probably the tastiest juiciest juice drink in el mundo.  (Diversity FTW)  The staff is super nice, and even though my Spanish is far from impressive, I never have any problem finding what I need.    Make sure you stop by for something wonderful, whether its Chicharrones, Tamales, or Takis (aka crack for kids)"}
{"text":"They seem to be in a somewhat bad mood at this bakery, however, it's all good cause that Cheesecake was well worth it! I bought my grandfather a cheesecake from here for his birthday and it was devoured in a minute... Delicious!"}
{"text":"5 stars because of a great guy named Jose who works at the butcher shop. He helped my mom & went out of his way to make sure the service was good. Very nice guy & very helpful! (-:"}
{"text":"I really love this place. There are tons of fast food options, but when you are tired of those and ready for great food that's very reasonably priced then I say head over here. I usually get the pork tacos but had my wife with me today and we shared the super nachos. It was so good and the flavors are all authentic. Also, there was so much food that 2 of us couldn't finish. Give this place a try. You will love it!!"}
{"text":"We showed up to a friends baby shower to find out that the time our invitation was wrong and we were early. 2 and a half hours early! Our friend suggested we roll with him to pick up a few last minute things for the shower while his wife finished getting ready. One of the stops was for some fruit trays at Mariana's and I'm so glad!  When entering the store it felt a bit chaotic. We headed right over where the fresh fruit trays are made and ordered one. The fruit trays can be ordered where they make the fresh fruit drinks and smoothies in the eating area. The fruit trays were $19.99 each and they cut it up fresh right in front of you.   After getting back to the house with the fruit trays and other supplies we were told that we didn't get enough and to go back and get 3 more fruit trays! So after going back to Mariana's and ordering 3 more fruit trays the worker informed us that they usually require at least 1 day in advance for any fruit tray to be made. She as well as another kind lady hustled to get all the fruit cut up and meet our needs. I thought that was so cool I mean she could have easily turned us away as they did have a long line for the fruit drinks.   Since it was going to be up to an hour for the fruit trays to be finished, I wanted to walk around and see what else this store had to offer. The butcher department was flooded with people and they had such a nice variety of meats you can't find at Von's or Smith's etc. The produce department didn't leave much of a good impression to me. The fruits and veggies were small and nothing spectacular. Maybe it was the day and maybe it was the time of season who knows. The bakery department was for sure my favorite! They had such an assortment of breads and pastries I never even knew existed. Their \"Tres Leches Cake\" looked so yummy. They had a smaller version for only $4.99! The donuts and GIANT cookies were also $4.99 a doz.   I was now back to the fruit drinks and spotted a tasty looking ham sandwich in the case. My friend insisted I try it and bought it for me. I sat at a table in the eating area and had my way with this delicious jamon sammie! The cheese that was on the sandwich was a nice and different and hit the spot. They have plenty of options for food such as tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and much more made fresh to order in the eating area. I want to go back and try the tacos.  I am so glad that we came to this store! I will for sure be back for cakes, pastries, breads and to eat lunch as it is all conveniently in the same corner in the store. I can't see myself really going out of that *corner* though since the produce didn't appeal to me.  Please remember to call ahead if you need anything made on a certain day so that you can make sure to have it when you need it."}
{"text":"Meats, vegetables and fruits are low priced. Although sodas, chips and canned goods are extremely over priced. A gallon of sunny delight is priced at 12$ you can get a gallon of sunny d for 5$ at WinCo. I will continue to do my grocery shopping at WinCo."}
{"text":"I love the carneseria and bakery here!!!! Not on my side of town but whenever I work in this area I stop here for lunch! Great burritos! And they have lengua!!! I love that each section has a cash register makes it so easy to order and pay. Fresh cut fruit and Mexican waters! When you buy food you get access to a salsa and chip bar!   Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"I've died and gone to Mexican Heaven!  Mazapan? Ganzitos? Limones? Agua Fresca? Pan Dulce? Tortilleria? Carneceria? Aqui lo tienen!  All I can say is when I was in the housewares aisle and I found a ice shaver to make raspados, I was like, that's it, I can't believe it!   This place was one pi√±ata short of a fiesta.  All things Mexican and I love it, love it love it!  I can't believe it took me this long to get here.    I love to cook and entertain so I can't wait to come back to the carneceria to buy some drummettes, flank steak, shrimp, carnitas, tripe, etc.  And to actually have some fresh tortillas?  People this is a throw back!  I spent many summers in Mexico and every day we would walk to the tortilleria for two kilos of corn tortillas freshly made, so the tortillas will be in my basket on the next shopping run.   The only negative: I could have done without the wandering hobo in the store, but that made it even more authentic.    So I picked up some pan dulce-awesome array of traditional pastries.  The deli had lots of Mexican food items on the menu and many tables to sit at, the Aguas Frescas were out-so couldn't sample but if you're going to throw a Cinco de Mayo party-go here!    They have clay pottery for beans and salsa, hand juice extractors (everyday in Mexico we would make our own limeade from key limes, so I had to get me some limones and a juice extractor to replicate some key limeade!)    All my favorite kid snacks were here too. It was like walking down memory lane! I use to walk to the corner \"tiendita\" back in La Colonia in Mexico to get some Ganzitos (chocolate mini cake filled with frosting and jelly. We'd put them in the freezer to last longer and you can enjoy them right out of the freezer too).  Then I had to get my all time favorite Mazapan candy too (made out of ground peanuts).   Oh, and I can't forget the MAIN reason I came here was to find this wonderful seasoning called TAJIN,  sprinkle on mangos add lime juice or sliced up Jicama, or street corn with mayo and queso fresco, or marinate your shrimp, etc.. It's main spice is chili powder but it's not spicy. You can find it in the produce aisle.  Go buy some!  Staff is friendly and helpful, store was clean, well stocked and organized. And yes, I bought the ice-shaver so now I can't wait to buy a block of ice and make the kids their own snow cones like I had when I was a kid.  It's all nostalgic and about creating memories right? Marianna's will definitely help me do that!   Great prices too, but they don't take PESOS!  People, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"4 item dinner with soda for $6.99 - had the fried fish, rice beans and soda, flour tortillas.  unlimited chips and salsa free - then a slice of strawberry chocolate cake for dessert...done!  fat! happy!"}
{"text":"Vegetables are cheap but was very low quality. Most dry goods are overly priced. Meats were decent but not what I needed today.  The food court was very delicious. I've never seen a condiment bar with corn tortillas. Granted it was the broken pieces, but it still was free. I love fried pork rind with meat on it and they make it just right here. I also picked up a tres leches cake. I always get my tres leches from here and its always delicious."}
{"text":"I love the fresh baked goods!!  They come out at 6:30am everyday nice and hot!!  But the store does stink from time to time like raw meat that is slowly getting bad."}
{"text":"This is one of my local supermarkets. I see myself coming here once a week they always have specials, plus the staff is very friendly. They have a variety of stations  We can start off with the   Bread/cakes  They have a wide and cheap assortment of breads and cake that you can choose from. Its freshly baked everyday. I would highly recommend as that you give the stuffed bolio a try. It has jalapenos and cream cheese baked on the inside.The cakes are great as well.  Meat Dept Every week they run great specials on different meat or seafood. It is very clean and organized. (Sometime the lines are really long but worth it cuz there are some cute guys in the back)  Produce I would be careful when looking at the produce from my perspective they have cheap cheap produce, but sometime they have a lot that is on the verge of going bad.   Hot food  This is the best they have carnitas, chicharron en salsa verde, beans, rice, fried onions, fried jalapenos, and boy oh boy oh boy they are effin delicious. They have family packs where you can get 2lbs. of  carnitas (pork meat) beans, rice and tortillas for around $18.00 bucks.  Enjoy. I might have missed something, I will edit as I go along."}
{"text":"You get what u pay for.. produce is cheap, but at what cost? They probably get it from some 3rd world country that uses sewer water to grow it. Plus be careful when u buy meat. I bought 20 pounds for a birthday party and I was hoodwinked. They grabbed my meat from the back, not the one on display. Employee claimed it was the same. At first no big deal, till I got home and to my surprise, there was more fat than meat. Almost started a grease fire and make a mess of my grill. Meat smelled funny and was like chewing through a tire. Wonder if the health inspector ever visits these types of places and how much they pay their staff?"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  The ladies are always super friendly. Even though I seem to be the only white girl there lol. Great prices. But if it is something that Wal-Mart sells the price is twice as much. Meat is great and great price. Love this store."}
{"text":"This location is by far the best one. The layout of the store makes it easy to navigate and is well maintained. The hot food has so much variety and is very flavorful. I love the chicharrones! And the frescas are always prepared well, sometimes the watermelon is a little watered down, but very refreshing. The baked goods are always fresh and there's an assorted array of different types of sweets, it makes it so difficult to decide. The celebratory cakes are so festive and priced very fairly. Also the marinated meats are well seasoned and there's a great selection of prepared salsas. I'm really glad we have moved and are closer to this location."}
{"text":"What's an ASIAN doing in a mexican grocery store...  I  Come Here   For.... THE PASTEL DE TRES LECHES!  Mi gusta MUCHISIMO the pastel de tres leches!  I cannot find this anywhere else in this town.. Marianas is a conveint mexican gorcery store and you can find all the mexican ingredients here.. From takis to marias cookies im sure you can find everything you need here for a mexican fiesta!   But i am mostly here for the pastel de tres leches.. try now! they have it in fruit, strawberry, and chocolate flavor..   For my birthday i had them custom make this cake it cost me about 80$ but well worth it if you wanted something different and wanted to impress your friends... I know to the mexican world this cake is probably normal..  But if you ever see this place dont be scared walk right in and grab that cake! Everyone is pretty polite and helpful there!"}
{"text":"Every time we go we get horrible service!! The employees are super rude specially if you speak English to them. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"When we moved to this side of town, my husband and I were concerned about trying to find a nice little Mexican market to do our shopping at.  We frequented La Bonita by our old house.   The La Bonita on this side of town is a little far, so we decided to try out Mariana's.   Mariana's is super convenient, just off of Cheyenne and the 15!    This location is big, and every time we've been in, it is super clean.    The staff is friendly, and very helpful.  What we loved the most, however, were the prices.  4 pounds of limes for $1?  Done. 2 HUGE bunches of fresh cilantro for $1?  YES PLEASE. 5 bunches of fresh herbs for $3?  Of course!!  Prices, especially on produce, can't be beat.    They have a bakery that smells amazing every time we walk in.  They also have a little cafe that I can't wait to try out.  tamales, pozole, tacos...  We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive produce and cuts of meat for very reasonable prices is what I think about when I think of Mariana's. When I need kale, baby spinach, and oxtails I only think about one place. 2lbs of oxtails for $8 is decent. It becomes better when those two pounds are meat heavy instead of all bones. With enough care and patience, these tough cuts can turn into the most beautiful of stews.   I will admit that I was a little overwhelmed by the chaos going on around me. Loud noise, busy crowds, a large inventory to go through, and not exactly knowing what everything is makes for a disheveling situation.   Once you get past all of the craziness, Mariana's has so much to offer."}
{"text":"There was this awesome clerk that helped me without me even asking. As a worker for customer service i found him extremely helpful. Thank you very much Prospero"}
{"text":"Look, I don't know anything about what's cheap and what's not when it comes to Mexican fare at a Mexican supermarket. For someone like us who wants to get down with our own Mexican night at home...this place has it ALL. The prices seem to be within reason as we have nothing else to compare it to. If it isn't leaving a sting in our pockets...we're good.   The bakery is deelish! The smell and the bake good themselves. I really wish I knew the names of what we have eaten in the bakery or what's even in there, but all I know is they're very reminscent to bake goods I've had in the Philippines...and they're cheap!  We love going here for not only our own Taco Tuesday, but their fruit bowls are ridiculously cheap! I love that there's even papaya in them! We have gone on road trips and made this our stop specifically for their fruit bowls. Way cheaper than heading to Costco or even smiths. Although, it is hard to communicate with the workers when you have a question...we've managed to figure it out. I personally wouldn't come here as my grocery store, so to speak, but it definitely is our go to spot when we wanna cook Mexican fare.   Highly recommend! Oh, and they do have a hot food section in there! We've only eaten at the one on Sahara so I can't really say...but the one on Sahara was pretty legit. Not only do they have a free salsa bar but they do offer free tortilla chips too! Yay!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible looking cakes and even worse customer service. We bought three cakes and two of them were wrong. They said nobody was there to fix them and they couldn't do anything about it. There are no managers in the store on weekends so they couldn't fix the situation. What a huge disappointment for a children's birthday party! I would give them a zero if I could."}
{"text":"Didn't know this was a Mexican market. They don't have basic things like granola bars or trail mix. There are no common brands that you would see in a regular supermarket..."}
{"text":"This is the first Mariana's Supermarket I have visited since becoming a Las Vegas local.  In fact, I have been coming to this supermarket on and off for the past few years since I started taking classes at the Cheyenne campus of College of Southern Nevada.  It is a convenient location for grocery shopping for fresh produce, ethnic grocery items from south of the border that may be hard to find in your local Smith's or Vons.  The best part about Mariana's is their juice bar. They serve smoothies made from fresh fruits, fresh cut fruits, horchata, and other Mexican or Spanish-origin beverages.  They also have a service deli counter where you can order tacos, burritos, and one or two entr√©e combination plates, or purchase items by weight.  I tried their Lengua (tongue meat) and a large smoothie made with fresh squeezed orange juice and chunks of fresh pineapple, both were $3.99 each or $4.31 after tax.  The Lengua burrito was okay (I prefer Roberto's), and was filled with the tongue meat, rice, corn, beans, guacamole, etc, and is pretty filling.  But the fresh fruit smoothie is a great value, healthy and delicious.  Their bakery prepares baked goods i am not familiar with, and also have a selection of cakes for just about any occasion. It looks to be on par with the offerings at the other main stream grocery stores, and the quality of their baker's decorating skills is nothing to rave about, but they do get the job done. Plus most shoppers will probably not even notice that the quality can be improved with a little more attention to detail or training.   If you are planning to prepare Mexican dinner and don't have the time to marinate the meats, they have a good selection of marinated meats for a reasonable price. As far as fruits, the prices are reasonable to cheap, and for the most part very fresh.  If you are in the North Las Vegas area, check out this Mariana's or one that is closer to you.  Happy shopping!"}
