{"text":"We went in last week and loved our experience! Ordered appetizers - lamb and cheese / yogurt cutlets. They were awesome!  Not very impressed with the chicken dish we ordered for our main course but nalli gosht was very good. Dessert,  amazing!  Love the kalakand and pan icecream dessert. Will be back for the appetizers and dessert for sure. For the main course, we might need to try a few more dishes before updating this review."}
{"text":"Great food, great place and staff is super efficient and friendly . The presentation of food was very impressive ...so glad we finally have a restaurant  in Toronto which is perfect  for entertaining overseas  guests and it will definitely impress them."}
{"text":"My new favourite Indian restaurant. Really good quality food. Great and quick service by a very friendly server. Indian cuisine with a fancy twist."}
{"text":"I had been really looking forward to Mayura - and it exceeded my expectations on all fronts. As a self proclaimed foodie, I had been looking for a long time for a true fusion indian restaurant - one that had authentic elements of Indian food and also catered to someone with a more discerning palate. The decor is warm and inviting, high attention to detail is visible through the restaurant - from huge washrooms, to peacock monogrammed china and cutlery. The culinary industry in Toronto has really been desperate for a high end Indian restaurant and I believe Mayura is it. I was a bit concerned about how far they are initially when I saw the address, but getting there on the 407 was a breeze. The food itself is exceptional, Chef Ranveer as the brains behind this and Chef Rahul creating his innovative recipes on a daily basis, everything about Mayura will leave you wanting to come for more. I like the private dining rooms, which would be great for private functions or corporate events. Highly recommended. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ambience is great. Food is ordinary. We ordered butter chicken. The chicken was under cooked. We ordered lamb kebabs, they were okay."}
{"text":"The menu were paper print outs.... the ambience is great the staff is good but the food did not impress me much."}
{"text":"So we booked a table for Valentines dinner on Jan 28th, 2 weeks ahead at Mayura. Yesterday when we  went there, they didn't had our name for reservation, anyhow we were able to get a table but pathetic service. I know it'll be hard to believe but we were served water after an hour and half yes after an hour and half and we got our appetizers after that. We told the waitress to bring our main course(which we ordered along with appetizers) right after 15 mins but it never showed up even after waiting for half an hour again. We went to manager and asked to cancel our main course and bring the bill and even for that they took 10minutes. My worst experience ever, will not be going and never recommending this place to anyone ever."}
{"text":"I have no words for this place. The worst indian restaurant in GTA. Boxing Day dinner. It took 20 minutes to get water, 30 minutes for our first drink and the appetizers took an hour. Chicken tikka came cold. Fish Tikka was stale and spoiled. When complained waitress said hst the main chef and manager is off. The food won't be good tonight.  We thought if leaving but wa scold that we decided further to have mains. And that was the worst decision.   All mains were either cold or raw. The curries had no flavour. On top waited for bill for 45 minutes."}
{"text":"The moment I entered Mayura, I was impressed. The ambience is very relaxing and welcoming. Note there's no buffet for lunch. I ordered Anders Aalo, Dal Tadka and Garlic Nan. They were all amazing. Very unique taste and not like other restaurants where they all taste the same."}
{"text":"We ordered tandoori chicken and it was really yummy and tasty. Must try. Simrat was really helpful and friendly. She was taking care of us  really well. Loved the service. Will come again definately"}
{"text":"It looks like they invested all their capital in swanky interiors and a gorgeous looking bar. Maybe, just maybe a little investment in training their staff and more importantly, on chefs that prepare decent meals would have justified what they charge for the insipid and instantly forgetful food.  Despite mixed reviews, we decided to have our anniversary dinner here and boy what a utter catastrophe that was.  If appetizers fail to ignite the taste buds, something is quite wrong! And for a fine dining restaurant if the presentation is not up to the mark, then a serious reconsideration is warranted!  Rampuri Boti (lamb) and Paneer Tikka Angaara (cheese cubes) were a total disappointment. Lamb felt as if it was left to simmer in tomato pur√©e. Paneer was dry! Wife was so pissed off she returned the same. The same was replaced by chicken which made matters worse.  We ended up leaving and getting a take out elsewhere. On our anniversary eve!   Booooooooooooo!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Mayura with high expectations. I will admit, we went during the soft opening so still time for improvement, but our experience was not a good one.   The restaurant is nice and the renovations are impressive. When we booked our reservation, the hostess failed to inform us that they did not yet have a liquor license. This is an easy fix moving forward and shouldn't be an issue as of next week.   Appetizers were ok. Heavy focus on presentation but honestly, it wasn't anything special. The $29 prawn app and the $17 chicken tikka app tasted exactly the same...   No servings were enough for more than 1 person. Although the waitress advised they were \"shareable\" they were not.   The mains were extremely disappointing. We ordered 6 different mains. They came out after a 45 minute delay, and all at room temperature. This is inexcusable.   Overall, the soft opening failed miserably. I hope they improve and do well but as of right now, I am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Decent potential but definitely some kinks to work out (granted I went before the official opening)... Service was mediocre at best - our server was definitely not customer-focused. We ordered all dishes mild but 2 out of 5 came back very spicy and the restaurant did not offer to fix any of them (nor did they apologize). We ordered a second round of food (since we couldn't eat a lot of what we were served) including a second order of one of the dishes except it was completely different the second time around. Given the poor service, inconsistent food, and price/value ratio, I think there is room for improvement. That being said, you can tell they've invested in the interior decoration and they've done a great job!"}
