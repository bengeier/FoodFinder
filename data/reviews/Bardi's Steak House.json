{"text":"Decor is getting dated but central location in middle of business season and -15c weather makes this always a welcome trip. $50 a plate min is a little steep considering waiter and space is exactly high end compared to rest of Toronto. Food though is amazing with any of the steaks more than satisfying...but I'd hesitantly take Keg over this place for a better decor and slightly cheaper plate price."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying that the food is very expensive compared to your typical steak house. The steak itself was very good, my boyfriend had that as his main. I however got the chicken, which was not very good. I am quite picky when it comes to chicken though. The service was good but I couldn't help feeling a little out of place. The restaurant itself has a nice quiet atmosphere, but the decor and lack of maintenance on the building itself don't have that high end/ expensive quality. Overall good food, good service..... 62$ for a steak is a little too much for me."}
{"text":"Great Steak house. We got the Travel Zoo deal which was way too much food but the 22 oz RibEye bone in was cooked to perfection and they have great dessert options if u can fit anymore food in. My only complaint is the very very dated decor. If the decor matched the food I would have given it a 5"}
{"text":"terrible service. they commented on my ethnicity loudly during my meal in another area of the room and never came to the table once to ask about my food. I would have ordered more wine and desert (the food was decent) but they just never came to ask. Will never come back"}
{"text":"I could have given 5 stars as I think Bardi is superb steak restaurant. But service was so slow we almost suspected they went to a slaughterhouse to get our cuts of steaks. It was a disturbing thought but there was no way grilling 2 steaks could have required an hour! But New york strip I had was cooked flawlessly and it tasted delicious. We also had shrimp cocktails and escargots for appetizers, which were intriguing as well. Steak selection is small as staples like porterhouse, neptune, chateaubriand and so on and such are not available. Service was excellent and I loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Bardi's Steak House - The Worst Steak House ever!!!

Went to Bardi's Steak house on May 27, 2011 and ordered the \"BARDI'S SPECIAL\" @ $47.50.  Hoping to get a real nice juicy piece of meat but unfortunately I was very very disappointed.  Assumed that I would of gotten a decent meal for the price of $47.50 for the meal (with only one other table in the entire restaurant)...all I got was a piece of steak that was way way over salted. It tasted like the chief was pissed off and was trying to kill me with salt!  The meal was so unbearable that I only had few bites and left the entire steak (which was supposed to be 18 - 20 oz) untouched.  When the comment was given back to the server, the \"not so attentive\" server simply took it away and disregard the whole thing (really?? with two tables in the restaurant???). Regardless, I paid for my meal (with decent tip - as I work in the service industry) and went home on a hungry tummy (Thank God for Instant Noodle!!) with over-salted tongue and a bad impression of the restaurant and the service.  

Thanks Bardi's for taking yourself out of the picture forever for being a so called \"Steak House\" in Toronto for me and many others.  For the sake of the general public, stop trying to attempt murdering your paying customers with salt and inconsiderate customer service.  Shame on you!!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table well in advance by telephone for a business meeting. Asked for a quiet booth and was told no problem. On arrival we were shown a table in the middle of the dining room - not private at all. Discussion ensued and were provided a booth - happy. 
Same waiter we had the 'discussion' with on table location managed our table. Unfortunately he was abrupt while reviewing the menu, to the point of being somewhat rude. 
Wine list - Argentina varietal preferred by one guest - no wines left under $100 - this just seemed strange, as there was no lack of stock for those well above the $100 mark. 
All three of us had steak - pricey but cooked to order and flavourful - baked potato was great (justified three stars). 
Waiter a little more friendly, and slowed his conversation down a bit, when bill was presented - likely hoping to leave a positive impression before we assessed the tip - a little late. 
Although I have eaten here several times in years past it was for lunch vs dinner. Never had the negative experience we did with this waiter. 
Unfortunately - will not return."}
{"text":"Went there last week. Garlic cheese bread, French onion soup, bone on rib steak....all very good, steak quite flavourful. Service was very attentive, atmosphere/setting very comfortable.....will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Fine dining, that's for sure. I dressed up for this one. Bardi's is a premium steakhouse in Toronto, and accordingly charges those premium prices that everyone loves. Like anywhere it has its ups and downs. Allow me to break it down for you.

Food Quality: Outstanding as expected. My New York Strip was in the 50 dollar range. While intimidatingly expensive, it's was delightfully tender, and flavorful (and not to mention quite large). I left Bardi's a fuller, fatter man. I have no complaints within this realm, the food is outstanding, if you don't mind paying for it.

Service: The service was also fantastic. My server was really courteous and had a sense of humor as well. I recall him joking with myself and others at the table. The food came within a reasonable time, and he checked up more than a few times to make sure everything was alright. 

Decor: The decor in Bardi's is difficult to really evaluate. The thing is, I like it, but at the same time it felt dated, and a little odd. It's a smaller place. It feels intimate, the kind of place you might celebrate something. I wouldn't call it fancy by traditional standards, but it's definitely upscale; just feels a little dated.

Worth a look if you've got something important to celebrate, have far too much money, or are craving a fantastic steak which you don't mind paying for."}
{"text":"After an enjoyable visit to Ripley's Aquarium it was a short walk to Bardi's. I was fortunate that I was being hosted by family in celebration of my birthday. They have known for years that this is my favourite restaurant.  Two of our group of four had never been here. We were shown to a booth immediately and drinks were ordered and received quickly.  Our waiter noted that we were busy visiting so gave us lots of time prior to ordering. Everything arrived efficiently, hot & delicious. One rack of ribs, two filets & one Shrimp Bardi's. Everyone agreed that the entire meal was fabulous.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We bought the travel zoo deal and it was pretty good! Came in on a Saturday night at about 830 and it was completely dead - surprised about that! We had the smoked salmon for the app - delicious!! I ordered the 8 oz filet and my husband ordered the rib eye. Generally pretty good but a bit salty. The cheesecake was awesome! Wish that they would update their decor and more ppl but overall great value with the travelzoo deal!"}
{"text":"This was our first time for Bardi's.  The location for me is anything but convenient, but that's personal and has nothing to do with the quality or service.  It does add significantly to the overall experience and cost. Parking in the area can be expensive and hard to find depending on the events taking place in the area, hockey etc... We had bargain street parking at $12.

The company I was with was great. This is important and can have an impact on the overall feel and mood.  Both Jacob and myself were celebrating our birthdays and decided to splurge a little. We've known one another for less than a year and both have birthdays in the same week, It's always an interesting experience when we are together.

The service over all was excellent, Chris our server was fast and attentive and the supporting staff seemed to be right on.  Being nondrinkers we skipped the wine and jumped right in to the main course with a side of cheese garlic bread (not so good), asparagus (cooked to perfection) and the Ontario 10 Oz sirloin (master piece).

The cheese and garlic toast for two was piping hot and highly recommended and was a big disappointment really but the 10 Oz top sirloin with baked potato and the asparagus, done to perfection. The quality of the meat was exactly what was anticipated. 

We sat on the second floor which looks and feels totally different from the older main floor. I would have preferred the main floor.

When the bill arrived we were both surprised, very affordable given the quality and location. We would go back if we were going to be in the area.

Very satisfying."}
{"text":"Not worth the money they charge. I've been to many steak houses around the world and several in the Toronto area. I went for a meal with my three siblings since I was in town. The service was slow, the wine overpriced, and the food mediocre at best. Beyond all that, I did not find the waitstaff particularly attentive or friendly. Also despite the fact that we were literally the only group in the restaurant at the time it still took over an hour and 15 minutes before the food arrived. Next time I'll save some money and have a higher quality experience by going to the Keg only a block away."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich from Bardi's is a Bay Street staple. Those who have had it will know that there are often tough bits (which are especially awkward in a sandwich!) in the steak. Their dinner steaks are not much better (though slightly more affordable than other steak houses). To make up for it, Bardi's does have some of the best garlic and garlic/cheese bread in the city! The interior looks like somewhere the Godfather would have frequented. It's nice, but from a different era... like the neon sign out front. I wouldn't turn down a meal at Bardi's, but there is better steak to be had in the city."}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's most iconic steak houses, and my go to.  Very classic décor and atmosphere.  Great ownership and friendly staff.  The selection of beef is good, as are the accompaniments.  What a selection of wines (have a look upstairs) - wish I had the coin to buy some of the rarest bottles.  This is a great place to escape for an hour or so with friends, colleagues, a loved one, or the Financial Times.  There's a reason Bay Street powerbrokers come here to celebrate closings."}
{"text":"Tired
We had a little higher expectations with a restaurant celebrating it's 50th anniversary and the level of class. Any cocktails we asked for only came in a full bottles. Even champagne cocktails. A sign of a place trying to save money. Steak was sent back because it was over cooked. Second round of the steak was perfect on the inside but burn on the outside.  Geez, we definitely expected more from a long time institution and a place with this level of price point."}
{"text":"I had a good 16 oz. \"Ontario\" cut of Black Angus beef.  I had it served medium rare with fries.  The steak is $42 and was good but not great. The fries were below par. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant feels old but not in the years of tradition sense; more like a slightly worn-out sense.  

The feeling I'm left with is that I'm glad I tried one of Toronto's noted stake houses but I don't feel they delivered value for my $42 steak compared to say Hy's or Ruth's Chris.  Both Hy's and Ruth's Chris are in the very near vicinity and are in the same price range, so either one of those would be my pick next time.

If I based my review on the steak alone this place would be great and I'd probably give 4.5 out 5 but in this market, and especially in this economy, a dining experience isn't based solely on the food.  Bardi's is a good place to eat but it could be great."}
{"text":"After a long day at a conference, 10 of us went for a late dinner. The restaurant was kind enough to set us up upstairs in one of their function room. We had an assortment of food including their popular cheese bread, and lots of steaks. We seemed to have a good variety of steaks and everyone seem to enjoy their meal. The various sides included mushrooms, asparagus and Brussel sprouts. Some elected to have desserts such as the chocolate cake, sherbet. 
Great selection of wines complimented our evening."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but its an overated unfortunate has been. Skip it at all cost, it ruined our date night."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and food quality.  Old style restaurant.  Has been in business for 50 years!  We were in a hurry before a concert at the Air Canada Center.  They had us in and out in plenty of time for our concert.  We had steak, potato and escargot.  Drinks were spot on!  Would go again.  Ambiance is not really happening there but it is quality just in the old fashioned way."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's day. The restaurant had a bit of a classic pub/bar feel to it.

The restaurant offers complimentary coat check service for dining guests. 
The menu wasn't too extensive, as I guess it was special one used for Valentine's day. They have a very extensive wine list, priced per glass (up to ~$20.00) and per bottle (up to $7000.00 CAD), if you're looking to impress...or to burn a hole through your wallet ;)

The fresh bread was tasty. It was hot, with just the right amount of melted butter. The entrées were alright, nothing great. My boyfriend ordered a Caesar salad and I ordered escargots. The escargots were well cooked, but way too salty in flavour. 

The dinners were fantastic. I like my steak well done. Most places often suck the life and juices out of the meat when cooked well done, but Bardi's did not. The flavour was good, and the steak was still juicy, so I was really impressed with that.
Service was a little slow with taking orders or checking in with how the meal was/additional requests. I asked for a straw at one point, but never received it. The bill took a long time to get to us as well when it was requested.

Overall, 3.5/5"}
{"text":"4.5 / 5

Bardi's was an overall excellent experience for me.  The quality of their steak was exactly what I expected for the high price tag I was paying.  The service was good for the most part and our steaks arrived in a good amount of time.

The atmosphere was pretty nice too, although the restaurant is fairly small so it may not be suitable if you're going with large groups of people."}
{"text":"Yes, the prices may scare you at first; however, I found the food and service to be excellent, which I won't mind paying for.

I started out with the garlic bread, very good.

Then as an appetizer, I had the seared scallops....heaven!

I then had the Signature Bardi's steak cooked rare, good lord, tender & amazing.

If you're downtown, stop in.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The BEST Steak I have ever ate!  I was in Toronto on a business trip, and a collegue and I were looking for some place to eat.  Most of the places we had thought of going too were way too crowded due to a Maple Leaf's game going on.  We walked by Bardi's Steak House and decided we were in the mood for steak.

The restaurant is a small establishment and luckily for us it wasn't very crowded.  The menu is small, but according to the waiter who came with a very thick Italian accent, all they do is steak for 40 years.  The prices seemed a bit high, but since the company was paying for it the cost didn't matter.

I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon, and my collegue ordered the 10 oz New York strip.  As soon as we sank our forks into our steaks we both knew this would be an extremely tender steak, and we were right.  My steak knife literaly ran thru the steak like it was butter.  Usually I have to add salt to any meat I order so I had the salt ready, but always taste before hand so I know how much salt I will need to add.  The first bite was absolutely divine, as it melted in my mouth with the perfect blend of seasonings.  I was so amazed at how tender the steak was that I tried out a theory to see if I could cut it with a butter knife, sure enough the butter knife cute thru with ease.  Before we were finished, we both declared that this was most definitely the best steak either of us had ever had the pleasure to devour.

The decor is a bit old world style and it's not modern but frankly I liked the ambiance of the place.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had ordered it medium rare, and it came out just slightly underdone from what I prefer.  But frankly the flavor was so good I didn't have the heart to send it back.  We had no appetizers, no dessert, or salads, and only 2 drinks between the 2 of us and our meal came out to $136.00 CAD"}
{"text":"Steak and wine here were good. Expensive but good, though I wouldn't say it's good value for money. Decor is dated... No modern clean lines here, just the old wood look."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant near our hotel (Fairmont Royal York). 

We were greeted and seated immediately. A minute or two later water, a basket of warm bread and menus were brought to the table.

About five minutes after our waiter J. arrived. We were told the specials and wanted to order a bottle of wine. Instead of reciting a memorized script, he offered samples from three of the four bottles we asked about. We made our choice and a new bottle was opened. We spoke with J about the restaurant, its wine room, cigars and a few other topics. He was very friendly and supremely nice.

We ordered a shrimp cocktail, surf & turf, an 8oz filet mignon and Ontario mushrooms. The mains were served with a baked potato. 

Everything was cooked perfectly. 

Towards the end of the meal J. came by and asked if we would like dessert. We would, but not right away. That wasn't a problem. Based on the earlier cigar conversation, BF asked if he knew of any near by cigar shops. He did. His friend owned a place.  Although the shop was about to close, J. called saying someone was stopping by in a few minutes and to stay open. 

Since I was now sitting alone, J brought over an \"on the house\" cappuccino. BF returned a 15 minutes later with cigars. 

We ordered dessert, and since it was late in the evening, and we were two of the only people there, J showed us the upstairs wine room. It's a great space and perfect for private/group dining. 

We returned to our table. BF asked for a chocolate martini with his dessert. J. didn't know how to make this. We told him what's normally in the drink and he went to make it. It was perfect and delicious. He added his own twist on the ingredients and it was the best chocolate martini I've tasted. 

All-in-all this was a perfect dinning experience. The food was fantastic, but J.'s kindness, humor and service put this way over the top. 

Amazing."}
{"text":"I was open minded about the restaurant.  The price has a tendency to scare you away.  I ordered the 12 oz Filet medium and a baked potato.

When you steak arrived it was burned on the outside and my first bit left a bitter tasted.  I preceded to cut into my Filet and it was completely over cooked.  My baked potato was also over cooked the skin was brown and inedible.

I wish I could post pictures."}
{"text":"We've been in Toronto for a few days and this was the best place we've eaten!  Great, attentive and polite staff! The food was perfectly cooked and delicious!"}
