{"text":"Order the Zane .....



The most delicious food ever... I dont write reviews ever.... ... but the collard greens... and potato salad....OMG....."}
{"text":"I was very upset yesterday when I went to support this company, and they were closed.  I have a Groupon  so I will redeem it, but I will not be returning to a place that waste my time (I do not live close to them)."}
{"text":"Ms C's restaurant is epic!  My wife and I went there on the fly as a previous restaurant we visited was closed. I am glad they were. Everything Ms C made was wonderful. I ordered the Rib and fish combo, and my wife ordered the four piece chicken snack box. Neither dish disappointed us. Moreover, Ms C's personality brightens the room which make the experience of the restaurant feel like home. This is definitely our new restaurant for great food by genuine people, and I recommend anyone who visits her restaurant to do the same."}
{"text":"Amazing place bomb food and good customer service got pulled pork sandwich and the Mac n cheese. Love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered catering for a business event.  The meat was so amazingly tender.  And, her cornbread is THE BEST!!!  I am not a big Mac N Cheese fan-- but, my clients loved it.  Believe me-- she is a great cook.  I just bought some chicken from Fry's to put on my salad and it was rubbery as heck.  There is no comparison even to Ms. C's LEFTOVER chicken!  It was awesome in my salads!  Plus, she's as sweet a lady as they come!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!.Is this even a real establishment?Looks like a front for something else.Food tasted microwaved and sauce tasted like ketchup. Prices are ridiculous. Better off going to the grocery store. This place is a joke ' horrible!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the sandwiches yet. But I will say the ribs were horrible! Extremely tough not even cut into ribs. Collard greens had way to much salt and the bbq sauce did nothing to complement the meat at all. Fries were the highlights of my night with this meal. Great people working there. Nice and friendly but won't return for the food."}
{"text":"As I walked down the walkway home this afternoon, I was overwhelmed by the smell of fresh BBQ smoke. I wondered what one of my neighbors was grilling and would they have enough if I stopped by for dinner. A new Barbecue joint open on the other side of the fence from our condo. Of course we had to try it. WOW!!!!!!! I thought I was down south again. I had the pulled pork sandwich and Susan had the catfish. Split the baked Mac n Cheese, Red beans and rice, and slaw. 

The pulled pork was excellent-tender, flavorful, and tasty. My wife had the catfish. It was lightly dusted with a cornmeal and cooked to perfection. Cannot wait to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Great hospitality from Ms. C herself, food is always Fresh and delicious! Hard to find but definitely worth looking for!"}
{"text":"We did wait awhile. Had a drink at the tavern next door. The food was wonderful. Came for the catfish and it is delicious. This girl is running a one-woman show so in order for her to make it we need to allow for some service gaps. The food is great."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago, had the chicken ribs corn bread collards. Bbq taste nasty, the tea was nothing but a cinnamon taste, bread was dry, collards were great. The cook was nice but I won't be back was hoping for some sweetie pies home cooking. Super disappointed sorry just being honest. I love food and eaten lots of places even my son was like I cant eat this."}
{"text":"Before eating the food me and my boyfriend was greeted by the nicest woman ever... After being out of a choice we selected she went to the back and whipped up something just for us to try (we came late). Everything was amazing and we were more than satisfied. Any bad reviews DO NOT KNOW SOUL FOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and tried the ribs. They were amazing!!!!! Not to mention the Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I got the pull pork sandwich and it is off the hook just so good and juicy I can't believe there's a real Bbq place here in Glendale now this is a must have"}
{"text":"We wanted so bad to like this place because it was cloee to home. The owner is very nice and friendly. We got the ribs, fries, and cornbread. The ribs seemed like they weren't cooked enough, no flavor, and tough to eat. The cornbread was very dry and couldnt eat it. Last the fries were the best part of the meal. We also had some salsa while waiting for our order, I'd go back for that. Hope it gets better owner is a very nice lady and would like to see this business succeed. If you want resl BBQ then try Bobby Qs, best we have had, and the cornbread is to die for."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday. I'd never heard of this place before, but we were looking for some soul food. He ordered the wings and catfish and I had ribs and greens. Believe me when I tell you that the food was out of this world delicious. The ribs were seasoned and fall off the bone tender and the sauce was finger licking good. My greens tasted homemade. My husbands catfish was seasoned well and fried crisp, just the way he likes them and the chicken was crisp on the outside and slap yo momma juicy on the inside. She makes her own special blend of tea. My husband said it was very good, however, I couldn't have any because she adds cinnamon and I'm allergic to cinnamon. Sniff sniff. I will definitely be going back. 
Thanks Pam for the lip smacking good food."}
{"text":"Order the catfish plater with colored greens and patoto salad. First fish was too salty. Second got Mac and cheese instead of greens. Don't I'll order again."}
{"text":"The best food I have had since moving to AZ a year and a half ago, and I'm from Chicago so I know what good food is. Ms. C is so friendly and fun you just want her to be your best friend or part of your family. I tried the greens first and couldn't even try anything else until I had eaten every last bite lol. The brisket was amazing, the fish was excellent and omg the baked mac n cheese :)  I have never liked anybody else's cornbread but my own until now-- Ms. C's is just plain delicious. I will be a regular customer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great ribs, so tender.  Love the wings. Our favorite place for delivery."}
{"text":"Southern inspired food. It was a pleasant surprise. Can't find decent southern food in Arizona, so I'm happy I found this place. The chicken was fried perfectly. The Southern Hospitality of the owner definitely made this place a hit!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place as did another reviewer. Mostly a funky take out place with a few tables.   Owner/hostess very welcoming and very nice. Ordered ribs, chicken wings, collard greens cole slaw fries and cornbread. Only drinks available were bottled water or iced tea. Told new food  items will be added in the future. Excellent chicken wings and greens. Ribs were tender, but sauce tasted like it was out of bottle. (Some choices of sauces might be a good idea.) Cornbread and fries average. honeybutter on cornbread would have heled. Really hope there is improvement mainly because of owner"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were recommended to this place by his parents we took the food to go, and when we got home to eat I was in shock! It's was the best barbecue I've had in a while! And the fried chicken was sooooo good! We had the Mac n cheese and collard greens and it was AMAZING! Very impressed and satisfied! The owner is an extremely nice lady and she provided great customer service! I wish them the best! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Awwww Suki Suki Na Our Hero Foodie & DJ Legend Cowboy Find Himself lookin For Some home Cookin and Ran Across Ms.C's This Was Off Da Chain With Homestyle Flavor Miss Pam(Ms C) and Staff are a Blessing and The Heart And Of Soul this Small Local Eatery Ok The Fried Catfish is Clean Tasting and Seasoned to Perfection also Yummy. The Greens, Fried Okra, and Cornbread were good as well now the Ribs where too be in the Southwest and now the Fried Chicken Wings (Y'all Know Thats Ma Thang) Though they were small they made everything up in flavor they also only been open a year this place should do well especially with the new things that she's planning on adding to the menu.... And yes Ms C Add The Gumbo lol Just Sayin"}
{"text":"Pulled pork, macaroni and ribs were amazing!!!! Good home style food! Everything was right on point, and the BBQ sauce was perfect, sweet with a kick! Portions were just the right amount! Will be going here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"We really liked the food except for the chicken wings, the coleslaw was awesome. My husband made sure to ask about the cornbread and was told it was in the bag but we were shorted out cornbread. I called and was disappointed that no one returned our call."}
{"text":"This is not a place to sit & eat.  Place not clean, no rest rooms at all. Food is awful, would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Arrived to find my order wasn't ready but I wasn't in a hurry or upset because they were very nice and courteous , honest and real with me. Great family vibe and energy from everyone. Food was great and flavorful , I think I caught the last of the greens and had to drop some spice on it but overall wonderful experience. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"3 stars I had a pork bbq sandwich it is really good. Mac and cheese was really original and basic fries as well. I bought a half a rack of ribs. Literally no meat pure fat. I don't care for the ribs but will definitely go back for that BBQ sandwich. had a good price 5.95 w/side. save your money on the ribs for sure."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I ordered off grub hub, and they took to long to pick up the food, so the owner delivered my food herself! Potato salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"Although the proprietor was very nice, the food was less than average.  Ran out of Mac & Cheese on the first day you open for the week?  No Ribs either & your title says Mrs.C. BBQ?  Ask for catfish, when I got home, it was frozen Whiting, I could buy from Walmart!  Porkchops were shoulder cut, like in assorted pkg., not Center cut!  Yams had to much cloves & dark.  Greens were so salty!  Took a long time to get food.   A) Food should be tasty & good, store front  clean & organized this place looks like something from 1962."}
{"text":"Catfish is good and the potato salad is terrific. However, the portions are tiny and not worth the high prices. Mac n cheese is bland, and I will likely not visit this place again."}
{"text":"I'm from California but I lived in Alabama and this place is perfect. Literally. Go here. Eat here. Write a good review because she deserves it and it's literally the best bbq I've ever had. I've had Bobby Qs. They're amazing. But this place takes the cake."}
