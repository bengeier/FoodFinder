{"text":"Was there on a very hot Saturday in July.  Felt stifling as either the A/C was not on or it was very low.  Ordered the eggs Benedict on steak. $13.99  It was not good at all.  The steak had no flavour and so tough and dry, I could not eat it at all.  Better to have just ordered it without the meat and save the 3 or 4 bucks.   One cup of strong coffee was $2.25, did not receive a re-fill.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bad service
Bad food
Bad facilities 

Filthy dishes.. when they brought us new ones they were also dirty. The food was so bad I couldn't finish.. AVOID."}
{"text":"I've going to egg smart for about six months, I love it. The food is amazing, and the people are so friendly.
NOW THEY HAVE SWEET POTATOES FRIES.  YUMMY."}
{"text":"I went to the queensway egg smart location and found that it is very clean and faced paced. I was greeted upon entry, offered a menu as well as seated quickly. Overall I found this location to  be very professional. I would definitely go back to this location. It was my first egg smart visit and I was impressed!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and the food is fast and good. It's very casual. I recommend the eggs Benedict with peameal bacon."}
{"text":"Went on Friday with friends & was disappointed. I ordered an omelet, which was tough.  The coffee was unpleasant. My friend asked for water 5 times before getting it.

Meh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, good food! This is my new choice for breakfast in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that there were many pieces of human hair in my food and I felt that no one appreciated how gross it was. Nor did they say they would do anything in the future to stop it from happening. Eaters, beware!!!

To be fair, I've come several times before and this is the first time I noticed the issue, which is either a good sign or extremely gross depending how you see it. 

Customer service was poor and they did not go very far to compensate (they just gave me a free coffee). I would say that if you want to go to this restaurant, check your food carefully so you don't get any surprising discoveries halfway through your meal."}
{"text":"I ordered waffles and a piece of the waffle maker was in it, very sad now #ripeggsmart #ripharambe"}
{"text":"So... I forgot my driver's license and wallet at home today the whole day going around in Mississauga and Brampton from Markham!! I started my day in Mississauga here at Eggsmart, not knowing that I have no money on me.... the very very nice Eggsmart owner (I believe he is the owner) at Dixie and Aimco (yes, go eat there please) was extremely generous... not only he prepared not to charge me, he was very patient in understanding what was happening and he had not shown he was worried that I couldn't pay him at all!!! 
He let my friend (who will rescue me from the outstanding bill) to go back and pay that bill over the weekend!! He is so nice!! He even wished me a nice weekend when I had to leave for my next appointment, again, without paying for my breakfast!!
Come eat here!! Their service was good too :)"}
{"text":"When one is in a mood for a cheerful breakfast to celebrate that it's the weekend, one is in the mood for eggs. I've been to this location before and it's perfect for a predictable, run of the mill decent breakfast (except for the potatoes - more on that later). I usually have the standard bacon and eggs, but this time I decided to try the sausage scrambler. 

As scramble egg dishes go, it was dry. After talking to the server, I understand why. Turns out that if they make it any less cooked (or soft, as she called it) then it gets watery. Sure enough, I've been to those dreadful breakfast buffets that offer scrambled eggs swimming in all this water. You learn something every day. 

My only beef with Eggsmart is the potatoes. Why can't they make homemade potatoes? These taste like they came out of the freezer section of they supermarket. Really? Is it too hard? If they have freshly squeezed juice, they should have fresh potatoes.

I gave it 4 stars because service was excellent, fast, and food was as expected."}
{"text":"Fast service but food is so so.  The fruit bowl was not fresh.  Potatoes did not look or taste that great.  The French toast looked like anything but French toast. Overall not the greatest place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Personally I love breakfast but this place made me reconsider my love for it.. First there is only choices of 3 eggs.. Seriously 3 is way too much and then I got the benny cuz I love'em but the peameal bacon she gave me was cold and tough really not good also the yokes werent runny and my coffee only refilled once.. Ill say for a quickie it might work or if I was a trucker in need of 3 eggs.. But no I dont recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service. If a waitress has ever been rude to you its probably because you're being a dick."}
{"text":"I had visited other Eggsmart locations in Downtown Toronto and liked them. My mother was curious after hearing about some of my positive lunch experiences, so we visited this particular branch one day to have a small lunch.

The store is quite big, and is well-maintained and clean. 

The food quality, however, leaves much to be desired.

We ordered a grilled chicken caesar with the intention of splitting it. The portion served, however, was not at all like the other locations I have been to: there was 1 piece of toast (cut in 2 halves) and approximately 1 piece of 'grilled' chicken cut into 5 thin strips.

The 'Texas toast' was very thin - not at all like what I thought was a Texas toast. It did not seem to be prepared in any way other than being heated in cooking oil until slightly burnt. 

The 'grilled' chicken didn't seem like it was actually grilled. It looked and tasted like chicken that has been pre-boiled in water and briefly re-heated on a grill - it was not well-boiled, even, as the texture was as rough and over-cooked as can be. 

There were also a few rotten leaves (or, at least, I hope they were rotten leaves - they were disturbingly squishy) amongst the lettuce. 

Even the 'ice water' we requested was subpar, as it was lukewarm and without ice :("}
{"text":"How disappointing!!  Went there for lunch yesterday with my mom and my sister and we all ordered the grilled cheese and bacon sandwich which they call their \"loaded bacon grilled cheese with 4 strips of bacon\".  The cheese was all in the centre of the sandwich and there may have appeared to be four individual pieces of bacon but it was about 1.5-2 pieces cut up.  What an incredible disappointment!  The home fries were hard as a rock and cold and we had to ask for the \"pickle spear\" that it's supposed to come with and ended up with sliced pickles for the top of a burger.  For a new restaurant, they need to get their act together or they will close really fast!"}
{"text":"Went there for a breakfast. Unexpected the small tiny hair on my plate which i saw it right away when she was putting my plate on the table, i asked her to change the plate for me but unfortunately,  i lost my appetite.  I ended up drinking coffee. The place was great. It was clean."}
{"text":"Co Workers and I had an early Friday morning breakfast here.
First off, they open at 6:30 on weekdays. So that's awesome.
We each had variations of the early bird special. There were sweet potato fries, turkey bacon, regular bacon and sausages ordered. Eggs were over easy to poached medium.
Everything was done very well. It all tasted great and the portion sizes were legit.
The coffee was good and the service was excellent.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, awful food. Thoroughly disgusted. I will never go back to this awful \"restaurant.\" 

Arrived just before 7:05. There were 2 other customers already seated. I sat down. Two more people arrived and were seated. I ordered the classic breakfast. 

Two more people arrived while I waited. Everyone received their food before me. My order arrived after 16 minutes. When I mentioned this to the waitress, she claimed that they ordered scrambled eggs which was \"easier\" to make. Since when was scrambled eggs easier than over easy?

I pointed out that I had ordered before 4 of the others, having arrived before them. Her response was that the food is good. 

The food was terrible. The bacon was cooked until dry. It was like flavourless strips of cardboard. The eggs were a combination of runny and overcooked. 

The \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice was also terrible. 

I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is a bit pricey but their pea meal bacon was the best my hubby ever tasted. The good was excellent and generous Portions. We got take out so I can not comment on the service but my husband what he did see was all above board. Good breaky place."}
{"text":"Wow....I wouldn't have thought you could serve such a HORRIBLE breakfast but if you want totally inedible food, it is here. Really awful :("}
{"text":"Great service, great food.   
Upped the prices with new menues but only by a small amount"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here because it was close to our hotel. First impressions were not good and set a bad tone for the meal. It was busy and our server brought our coffees and juices. 

The Mold: (the service)
My four year old opens a creamer and says she doesn't like it, so I'm about to pour it into my coffee when I notice a blue stain on the inside. Yes. It is mold. Furry stuff. What's worse is my kid just sipped this blue mold. I calmly tell the server and allow him to inspect the fuzzy little tub, and he says, \"Yeah, it happens. I've had that happen before.\" and when I say, no, this is not normal or acceptable, he gets defensive and keeps telling me \"it happens, ok?\" As if this is a good answer?!!  I work in the restaurant business and the first words out if his mouth should have been a sincere apology, and taking responsibility for the mishap. A new bowl of creamer would have been appropriate. Instead he just avoids us until the food arrives and never bothers to follow up with us again.

The Breakfast:
We had choc chip and blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs, and the sausage scrambler. The creamer mold made us all slightly nauseous so it's hard to say if the food was good or not. I was paranoid there was more hidden mold given the server's blase way about it. It seemed fairly ordinary, each plate decorated with a melon slice, but I had lost my appetite by then. I wouldn't say it's the cheapest breakfast joint for what you get. Plenty of other good diner options out there.

Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in here this morning for breakfast, I drive by every morning on the way in to work so I'd been meaning to try it. 
We must have lucked out as we got the last table in the joint. We sat for over 5 minutes before we were finally acknowledged by our waiter. It was 11:30 am on a Saturday and the place was packed so I didn't sweat it. Once our order was taken the coffee arrived in good time and our order didn't take all that long after that. 
My son ordered three eggs and bacon and I ordered the Montreal Smoked Hash and 4 eggs. Both orders came with toast and potatoes. 
When the orders arrived my son's plate was huge but looking at mine you could barely see the potatoes and smoked meat which were hidden under the eggs. There was barely any meat at all in the hash. My \"over easy\" eggs were cooked semi-hard as well. I could have made a much better breakfast at home. At least they kept coming around with coffee refills. My son said his breakfast was fine, but then he wasn't paying the bill. 
 $26 bucks plus tip. Ouch! 
This place also has no waiting area, by the time we finished and walked out there were people lined up out the door and along the walkway. I don't get it. 
There are plenty of places for a great breakfast, I'll pass on this one."}
{"text":"I love this eggsmart! The staff is very attentive and the service is ridiculously fast. The price is also awesome and i love the bottomless coffee. I go here at least once every few weeks."}
{"text":"Given the very negative reviews I wasn't sure whether or not to go here.  No regrets at all.  I had the smoked salmon and provolone omelette with home fries.  I told the waitress I didn't want toast, which came with it without expecting anything in its place; however, she happily volunteered sliced tomatoes, which was a nice addition.  The omelette was excellent, no skimping on the salmon which all-too-many breakfast places will do.  The home fries were excellent also, not over salted which is another common problem I've had.

All around, pleasant service, good food, fair price, nice decor.  Frankly, I've no idea why the other reviews were so negative.  I don't usually review things on Yelp, but given that I nearly didn't go, I wanted to put this review in so others wouldn't be deterred."}
{"text":"I came here at noon on a Sunday recently with 3 kids and 4 adults. We were seated right away in a large table by the window. There were other customers - I'd say it was half full but never got totally full. Service was attentive and portion sizes were generous. The kids menu had decent selection and was very reasonable. Prices of mains were reasonable as well considering the portions. The food was just ok - nothing special. I ordered a southwest burrito which was supposed to have avocado in it - the reason I ordered it - and I realized half way through there was no avocado. Another member of our party had the same dish with no avocado. We didn't mention it to the server since we were half done by that point, but we would have appreciated a heads up if they were out. Don't order the heuvous rancheros - not good - this is just not the place for it. Maybe stick to the traditional breakfast items."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a quick breakfast. The owner is very welcoming and friendly. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Eggsmart is a great option if you're looking for quantity. The \"Big Breakfast\" is good value. But if you're looking for a simple breakfast of bacon/eggs, just walk to Dovercourt and go to Billy's where it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Excellent and fast service. Super friendly staff that are attentive and there when you need them.  The food was made perfectly ans the menu has a great amount of options."}
{"text":"I have been here three times, each time during the week. The servers are pleasant, food comes out quickly from the kitchen and is fresh.  Nothing to complain about, one of the better and cleaner breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"Date: 31 August 2015

Dear diary, it was my second time this month coming to the conviniently placed eggsmart on Kennedy road. 5 minute drive away from my newly purchased house. The location was appetizing, unfortunately that's all that was appetizing about this place. We had the same server who served us earlier this month, we had hoped for someone else. We got the same thing we ordered last time,  my beautiful wife having a craving for the eggs of benediction...I ensured that this time around I told her \"...the eggs must run when poked...\" she gave me the nod of my people. The male gender nod of approval. And she bustled away to place our order, 10 minutes later she brought our food...and the eggs...THEY DID NOT RUN WHEN POKED"}
{"text":"Great service.  Another table was really rude and ridiculously picky, yet the 2 servers were egg-ceptional (sorry).  The eggs benny with peameal was disappointing; the sauce was very starchy and flavourless.  The nice waitress asked how I wanted the poached eggs (never been asked that before), but they didn't come as requested. The peameal was dry, thin and flavourless.  The home fries were oddly tasteless, and some sort of coating made them dry and dusty tasting. Breakfast out is a treat for me, (calorie and $-wise) and I was not satisfied. 12$ mis-spent. Easy restaurant (next door) seemed terribly expensive and hipster-doofus trendy, but perhaps it should have been my choice."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been in. The food was bad, the ketchup bottle had caked orange stuff all around it and the squeeze bottle of thinned out artificial maple syrup was greasy. Highlight of the meal was the entertainment. A cock roach walked across the table. I squished it on the wall. The manager faked shock at it and took it away but another employee admitted they've been having a roach problem for a while. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered the waffle with fruits. Fruits were not bad but the waffle was hard and dry. It was hot so I believe it's made freshly while it tasted so bad. 
Don't wanna go again but the service was nice."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly waitstaff!  Yummy food. Great value for the cost.  The fresh made juice is really good!"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff, and good coffee.  We went on Sunday and it was full.  Had to wait for a table but it was worth it.  Mediterranean Omelet was excellent."}
{"text":"The Indian server lady was great. The food was very satisfyingly hot with really quick service. We got the vegetarian and spinach omelette and they were really good. The restaurant was clean and had a cute diner atmosphere to take your special one to."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday, Feb 22nd. We got there when the mini rush was occurring. You self-seat yourself when its not that busy. We were greeted by an older lady who was promt to offer beverages. $4 for freshly squeeze oj? In a small glass? Is that even worth it? I got the grapefruit minute maid instead, and my friend got the tea.

During our dining time, we were never offered water until we asked. We asked for a refill for my friends tea. My friends turkey bacon he requested to have extra crispy never turned out that way. He asked if he can have his 3 eggs, two egg white and one scrambled and he was willing to pay extra, but another young server took our order and said b/c its the weekend its not allowed. 

We got french toast on the side, and I added extra sausages for $3. I ate like a beast. For two full breakfast, two beverage and a side for $30+ its alright. They had 4 servers running the whole restaurant, but I find every time (twice) we were trying to get an attention of a server, they were mostly looking down, or pretending to do something else. My friend paid the bill, but I dunno how much tips he left you know what I'm saying... The deal is there, but service is not quite there at this time."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine had some time to kill in the city while waiting for his bus, so we met up and walked about a block.  Their colourful signs  caught our attention and we decided that we were both in the mood for breakfast at 2:00 PM.

There were about 4 or 5 other people there; this didn't really change over our 40-minute eating/catching up.  Everyone got quick, really friendly service.  I was actually surprised at how fast our food came.  It was probably less than 5 minutes.

I had The Classic Breakfast:  Eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. It was a pretty big portion size and served at the perfect temperature.  Even better was the seemingly never-ending supply of those little packages of jam and peanut butter.  I love those things.

Try it out, and DEFINITELY get the fresh squeezed orange juice--unless you have a thing against pulp."}
{"text":"$4.99 for 3 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon or sausage, home fries, fresh fruit, and toast... can you really beat that? The servers are amazing (most of them, anyway, but I'm not going to hold that against the whole restaurant) and the food is always delicious. And FAST. You can get in and out of there completely full in about 20 minutes. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon excited to try a new breakfast place, and the prices looked very reasonable.  There seem to be more and more overpriced breakfast places popping up these days, so it's reassuring to see a place charging well under $10 for an Eggs Benedict, and similarly good prices on other breakfast items.  There was a bit of a line to get in (on a Saturday), which I took to be a good sign.  It turns out that it may just be the dearth of quality breakfast places in the area that contributed to the wait.

After we ordered, we were told that our food would be ready shortly, which was reassuring because the place was quite full.  30 minutes later, our two breakfasts arrived.  Unfortunately, my wife's french toast was cold, and the bread wasn't even soaked through with the batter - the middle was just plain white toast!  I saw them put the french toast up on the hot plate table (at the end, where the heat lamps don't reach) about 15 minutes before the rest of our meal, and it just sat there until the rest of the meal was ready!

The rest of the meal was average breakfast fare; the hash browns were decent but a bit salty (but who goes to breakfast expecting health food, anyways?).  The pancakes were mediocre (they tasted like mix to me).  The service was OK.  I don't think I'll be going back, which is a shame because their prices are reasonable and they're one of the closest breakfast places.  Also, if they had simply said that there was a bit of a wait for the food as well, I think I would have been less disappointed that it took them 30 minutes to prepare two breakfasts.  That wouldn't have excused the cold french toast, though."}
{"text":"* This is not the location we went to but Yelp hasn't yet listed one in Mississauga and/or can not find it...

I'm a breakfast kinna' gal and nothing gets me going like a good western omelette..erh I ordered a sandwich tho(0) I tried Twisted Joe; he's a tasty chicken all right. Didn't like the home fries; they were an undercooked half mashed potatoes pudding. The freshly squeezed OJ is expensive but quite a delight and worth every sip! 

**1930 Fowler drive right off the highway when galloping on a horse to the US, not listed in a yelping horizon but one day I'll find my way back for the good, the bad and the ugly omelette."}
{"text":"I had a $20 voucher for this location. I went with my friend on a Saturday morning. He ordered the big breakfast with extra bacon. It came with extra sausage instead of extra bacon, but the server graciously gave us extra bacon anyway. The pancakes were quite burnt though. He asked the server to bring new pancakes, which we received. The potatoes were undercooked, the toast wasn't really toast, it was closer to being untoasted bread. I ordered the smoked salmon on a bagel with cream cheese. The cream cheese was not spread out - it came in one big chunk in the middle. I was a bit concerned about the freshness of the salmon and would not purchase it again. 

The server was very friendly and accommodating, but the food left something to be desired. It was quite sloppy. Overall it was a decent breakfast with my friend, but I would return to this location without a discount voucher."}
{"text":"I headed over to Eggsmart after a long night of drinking with my girlfriends. Hoping that my meal would equate to something that I would receive from an establishment like Fran's, skilled in this area, I directed us to Eggsmart. 

The food was sub-par. I couldn't understand how a place that only opens for breakfast could survive with food of such standard at the price it was charging. 

Service was okay. I think I'd rather go to Cora's a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Bright, clean, family friendy atmosphere. Food was fast and very tasty. Coffee was awesome, service super friendly and the low prices are the best treat of all!
  Definitely worth seeking out. Find this gem and let's keep it going strong!"}
{"text":"Was in the area meeting my daughter for breakfast last Tuesday. We were walking along Dundas when I noticed the sign and assumed a place called Eggsmart would do a good breakfast......... boy was I wrong! 

I ordered the Scrambler, since I like sausage and it sounded a little lighter than an omelette or fried eggs. Also, the Scrambler is 9.99 which is more than getting 3 eggs with sausage (presumably at least 2). So I get it, and first for some unknown reason I thought a scrambler would be scrambled eggs (silly me). What I got was a horrible omelette cut up with MAYBE one sausage sliced up in it so thin you could barely taste it. It was greasy and tasteless. I tried one of the home fries, but that wasn't any better. The toast was good! 

Was trying t get the waitresses attention to get the bill which took about 15 minutes as she was too busy chatting on her cellphone. How do places like this stay in business???"}
{"text":"Good food, clean, reasonable prices, excellent service. Great for a Saturday morning breakfast. I had the French toast with fresh fruit. It came with sliced strawberries and banana. Very good. My wife had the standard bacon and egg breakfast and it was very good too. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best Eggsmart I've been to! The omelettes we ordered came very fast and they were cooked to perfection! The service was more than satisfactory. There were quite a few regulars when we went. The restaurant was really clean and it had a great ambience. They also had coloring sheets and crayons for kids :) If you go, definitely try their freshly squeezed orange juice!"}
{"text":"I came here because I've seen this place alot driving by and I wanted to try it out!
They had great service (the waiter gave us free freshly squeezed orange juice complementary because the order took a while to line up) and it came quickly :)
Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Had the pancakes with banana and strawberry, was delicious. Staff was very friendly, greeted you immediately upon entering. Service was good and fast. Food came out reasonably fast and hot. They have freshly squeezed orange juice which I lived. Good spot for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Overall:
2.5 stars

Parking:
Ample parking space in the front

Service:
Decent. I came at 1230pm on a weekday and it was pretty empty. I was served and seated immediately. My bottomless coffee was filled without asking. No complaints here. 

Food:
I ordered the peameal eggs benny, cooked medium. The egg yolk was the right consistency. However the English muffin was thin, chewy and burnt. The peameal was overdone, thin and on the chewier side. The hollandaise sauce was thin and sad. The side potatoes didn't seem very fresh and almost made me think they were reheated. 

Comparisons:
For the same price ($17 after tax and tip) I can get a hearty helping and better quality at coras or sunset grill.

Impressions:
Not my first choice of breakfast. I would come back if I absolutely had to, but probably won't."}
{"text":"Terrible.They gave me a different order.The sweet potato fries is so salty and oily.And the omelet is terrible.I never put any comment before but I can't help it now."}
{"text":"Went to this Eggsmart location this morning after our regular breakfast standby was way too busy.
It was SUPER busy as well, but only had to wait about 5 min. for a table (not the best table though...right near the front door...so people were lining up right behind us waiting for their tables and one lady decided to stand in such a way that her butt was facing the back of me, literally a few inches over my left shoulder- NOT appetizing at all!)

Aside from that unappetizing aspect, the service was fast, food came quickly and was quite tasty, good value for your money.  I had the veggie omlette, w.w. toast (comes buttered), homefries, a wedge of canteloupe and an orange slice...was good.  I also had fresh-squeezed OJ which was a nice surprise coming from a fast-food breakfast joint.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the cramped quarters/environment and some of the patrons.  I felt a little rushed as well, as people were lining up waiting for tables.

Will probably go again, but not on a weekend."}
{"text":"We try to walk in at 3:15 on a Sunday and they tell us that they are closed and no longer serving food?  The sign outside clearly states they're open till 4 pm.....Needless to say, will never return."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast with coffee, plain and below average taste.  You would expect the eggs to be the best since that's what in their name but no.  Overpriced for what you get in terms of quality, the staffs are polite and refill the coffee but it wasn't good coffee so I didn't want. The bacon was hard probably cooked straight from freezer without going from low heat first."}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient service! Servers offer coffee and tea refills often, and almost always have a smile on their face. The food was pretty good, I ordered a bacon and egg breakfast with their \"specialty homefries\". My bill came to about $11.00 which is reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast after a red-eye flight.

Got three eggs over medium with potatoes and coffee.

That's about all there is to say. It came really quickly, was perfectly serviceable for breakfast and the price wasn't bad. Only slight was that it took a bit longer than I'd have liked to get my bill payed."}
{"text":"I work in the area so thought it would be a good place to call in a breakfast order and walk over to pick it up on a break. Nope. They don't pick up the phone. When you arrive it's easy to see why. One guy is host, waiter, busboy and cashier. I saw my order was up and had to wait 10 minutes for him to notice and put it in a bag because he was so busy.  Thought they might have been short that day, so tried again the next week and \"eggsactly\" the same thing happened. No point commenting on the food, cause the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/lunch!! They have good menu options and potion sizes. The place is nice..little cramped though (atleast where our table was). I love that they serve fresh orange juice which is super good and refreshing. Overall a good experience!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty tolerant to bad experiences but Eggsmart took the cake on this one. Service was okay, they were peeling potatoes on the side...okay whatever...I guess I'll yell when I need service...ugh.

I got the eggs Benedict, probably one of the most unappealing eggs Benedict I have ever had. The sauce was lumpy, it had a weird discolouration, and my plate had a pool of water because of the poached eggs, which I didn't think the cook bothered to strain out...I make way better food than this.  

Overall, huge disappointment...and will be avoiding this place."}
{"text":"The food is always good and consistant, but aweful customer service. I found that one waitress lady very rude and \"rushy\" everytime, makes the whole visit unpleasant. I will try to go to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"I went on late morning with my wife and friend from out of town.  I ordered the peameal bacon sandwich with swiss cheese.  On the menu the description includes horseradish dijon.  I received my sandwich in a few minutes accompanied with french fries.  I started to eat my sandwich and noticed it lacked any flavour.  I removed the top bun.  No dijon.  Under the peameal perhaps?  Nope.  So I asked our waitress about the missing horesradish dijon.  She tells me that this sandwich doesn't come with it.  I grab a menu to check and point out the description for my sandwich which indeed should contain the dijon.  She tells me that people dont like it so they dont serve it with the sandwich anymore.
First of all, thats very different from her first excuse, that my sandwich didnt come with it.  So I say if you have removed it then change the menu, or tell me that it doesn't come with dijon so I can decide if I want to change my order.   That didn't happen.  As you can imagine the sandwich was dry with no dijon or mustard to cut the saltiness of the peameal bacon which was served warm like it was quickly reheated.  Not good.  The waitress continues by asking if I would like bbq sauce instead!!  Not mustard or other suitable substitute.  We promptly asked for the bill, paid and left."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the traditional breakfast with soft poached eggs yummy! It was a Bogo day on Tuesday, and this Friday Oct. 10, 2014 1 year anniversary classic breakfast for $2.99."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast if you are looking for something that you would have made on your own. I usually judge a place for their side dishes which in this example home fries. I love my starchy carbs but for this location, if it's busy, your home fries will be a little raw rather than crispy. 

Service was okay, price was decent, selection of jam was great but the reason for the lack of 2 stars is other breakfast restaurants are somewhat around that has better made side dishes for their main entrees for the same price. 

Will still consider this an option if there is nothing else around."}
{"text":"For a breakfast place in Scarb this place will do.  Staff remembers every returning customer and are super friendly.   From the moment I sit down I get our coffees without asking.  The severs never force you to leave.


Food wise isn't the greatest - it is a bit greasy,  but what do you expect from a breakfast/diner place."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sizzler omelet, with a side of bacon and orange juice. It was absolutely delicious! :)
The service is friendly, and relatively efficient. It can really be crowded on weekends which kind of sucks cause there's no waiting spot for people who have yet to be seated. So you either choose standing outside in hypothermic conditions or imposing your entire being on the poor sucker who is trying to down his Eggs Benedict without feeling uncomfortable as you hover over him."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine breakfast place. Had a hankerin' for eggs Benny and wound up here. The meal didn't disappoint. Got mine with peameal bacon that was a bit saltier than I'm used to - but hey, it's bacon! Homefries were also fairly tasty."}
{"text":"Best breakfast i had on my 10 day stay visiting canada. To bad i wasnt staying nearby or i would have eaten breakfast everyday here, I happen to find this spot by accident. What can i say, quick service, great taste and fairly priced. 5 stars in my book. Everything was cooked to perfection, I had fresh orange juice and a classic breakfast with bacon and rye toast. i asked for my bacon extra crispy, yum yum yum."}
{"text":"3 tables around us had issues with their food and so did we. Eggs were way too raw even for over easy. They were happy to redo them but they were still awful -- most of the egg white was still raw -- the second time ... how do you screw up fried eggs?!  -- sorry, that was mean.

Felt bad for the servers having to deal with so many unhappy customers but unfortunately, it appeared they were too busy and were getting orders wrong. They were nice and pleasant enough though.

Oh yeah, another couple was so fed up, they just got up and left when their food arrived."}
{"text":"Typical spot for breakfast. Food is not that bad. Service could be a lot better. The server was slow and disoriented. Didn't get my coffee for 10mins; had to ask for cream. If your hungry, why not. But if your a foodie, not worth the trip."}
{"text":"didnt like my breakfast at all! i asked for my egg to be well done but the egh white wasnt cooked.the toast wasnt toates properly.the sausage was really dry.overall i wasnt happy.not coming back"}
{"text":"Great food great people. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a must!! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great value for your money.  The menu has many breakfast options, both traditional and unique (for example, egg scramble bowls).  They also serve turkey bacon as a meat option, which is wonderful! 

My only complaint is that you may have to wait for a bit after you order your food.  We were only a group of four at our last visit, so not sure why there was a hold up.  Overall, that won't prevent me from going back."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Problem is my toast had mold on it. They made me a new plate eggs bacon toast etc right away even though I said im ok. I didn't touch the 2nd plate and still got charged full price. Long story short this location is not that good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday Morning. January  25th, 2015. It was okay. Had to ask for everything. And still did not get it. It was not that busy. Only 5 couples. Went back on the Monday,  and it was 100 times better. Everything was given with little being asked. Weekend staff needs to learn how finish off the little things."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff and awesome, delicious food. The food unfortunately came to us a little cold but other than that it was great. We tried the Blueberry pancakes, the Eggs Benedict and Location wasn't too busy when we came at 1:30 on a Saturday either."}
{"text":"Utter disappointed to start the day...
Potatoes were undercooked.
Pancakes tasted floury
Service to get the bill took a little too long (10-15mins)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Bit into a giant piece of glass that was inside my breakfast homefries. After realizing what I had bit into I then noticed several more pieces of glass mixed in the potatoes. My family and I notified the manager and left immediately. Completely unacceptable. We couldn't even be in the restaurant for another second after. My teeth still are in pain from biting down on the glass chunk."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great, I just moved in the area a month ago and stumbled into this place. Me and my wife order THE OJ....mmmmm. i ordered the Egg bennie and my wife ordered waffle with fruits. The food and service was amazing. Across the street there is a restraunt \"steve's\" , Horible! . Its unfortunate that they have no signage. I wish the best to the family operated owners. Good luck and i will definatly be back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First 2 times the service was below average. Went again this morning, service was horrible. Had to ask for coffee again when the food arrived, as it didn't come before. No offers of refills on their advertised, \"bottomless\" coffee. Our waitress found time to chat with friends at another table. I had to get up to pay, even though my debit card was sitting on the table for 10 minutes. Toast was cold. Even the butter on it wasn't melted - the waitress never came to check to see how things were. Save your money."}
{"text":"IF YOU WANT HAIR IN YOUR FOOD, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!! TOTALLY RUDE AND DISGUSTING SERVICE!!!! My friend had hair cooked into her food! We all lost our appetite and the 2 waitresses especially the INDIAN one was very rude and didn't even want to comp us.. The other Indian/Srilankan guy (the cook) he was super rude as we asked to speak to the manager and he said He will call the manager and we will have to wait an hour for him to come in and we will have to pay for everything including the one with hair... Very Very dirty rude place! WHAT IF THE COOK DIDN'T SHOWER FOR A FEW DAYS OR HAD LICE AND DANDRUFF? WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR DIRT?! GROSS! Owner was super rude too as we hear from the workers there. I wonder what their kitchen looks like?! NEVER EVER GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! I'm hoping I don't get food poisoning! Just disgusting. Service was horrible, food was horrible, workers were even worst. I WISH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE THEM A 1 STAR!! 

Nadia"}
{"text":"Utterly incompetent service - every time, the drinks don't arrive, the orders are wrong, etc.  The wait staff just can't handle 3 tables each!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday for the breakfast special but turns out it's only available on the weekdays, fair enough. So I went again on a Wednesday around 7:20am and it was not even open yet. I saw 2 other cars waiting outside but I just left right after I saw there no lights on and no staff inside. That's ridiculous.. they must have some irresponsible staff working there."}
{"text":"Terrible overall experience. The food was overpriced to start, so the two of us decided to split the Big Breakfast for $9.99. The eggs were ok, all the meat was over cooked and dry, the pancakes were under cooked and the home fries were also under cooked and unappetizing. To top it of, the service was terrible as well. The waitress passed us several times without asking how we were doing, and we had to wait over 15 min for the bill alone. We made a bad choice. Should have waited for Easy Rider."}
{"text":"Latest addition to this brunch-loving latte-sipping toque-wearing neighbourhood that is rapidly hipsterifying. I was surprised that a chain restaurant opened here. Oh well, I guess some dorky humor is not that bad.

There is a wide variance between the price and the quality/amount of food so I generally tend to avoid this place. Had it been a local restaurant, I wouldn't mind, but paying that much for a chain restaurant? Nahh.."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 3 years now, and I've always been impressed by the staff , they're friendly and professional at the same time. The food is always amazing. Always hot and fresh, the staff is always willing to help and accomodate  your needs . I am a big health finatic and it's  nice to go somewhere that you can get Turkey bacon or egg whites or freshly squeezed orange juice  .. Today I had a new wrap they have on their menu.. amazing!! This is the only Egg Smart I can honestly say has  never dissaponted me in their services or the food.."}
{"text":"Avg breakfast with decent pricing. Good for a quick bite. Waitress was slow for liking. Had to ask her for everything: more coffee, jam, a pen to sign my bill..."}
{"text":"The host was very friendly and got us our drinks right away. 
Tried the Eggs Benedict, the home cut fries were nothing special. I felt that overall our meal lacked seasoning that no amount of ketchup could fix. 
Although the service was great the food left something to be desired.
The bill came to $40 for two of us. Which I felt was a bit expensive for breakfast."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for the book club I am in. The last time was September 2016, but we've been here 4 or 5 times before that.

Typical breakfast food but done relatively well.

If I was in the mood for breakfast food, I would come here.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"the besttt breakfast ive everr had in my whooolleeee entiree lifeeeeee you have no idea what your missing until you have had there \"big breakfast\" it has everything eggs sausage bacon fruit pancakes home fries.. yes you feel very large after but because its not greasy your not feeling as guilty!  Yum!"}
{"text":"My issue with this location is the service. If there are any more than 2 tables, the wait staff don't seem to be able to handle the \"crowds\" very well.

Myself and others I have dined here with have experienced the following at this location, on numerous occasions:
* Waiting at the door for someone to seat us for up to 7 minutes, while wait staff walk by, not even saying \"I'll be with you in a moment\"
* Being seated and having to wait 15-20 minutes for waitstaff to bring us just a menu or take our beverage order - and then have to wait another 10 minutes to actually receive our beverages. I don't care how busy it is - if you bring beverages first and in a timely manner, people are far more amenable to waiting for their orders to be taken if they at least have a beverage
* On more than one occasion, we have seen other tables of diners , who arrived well after our party, being served beverages and had their orders taken before my party did.

We are not rude people. Just regular patrons who would like the priorities of the servers re-examined as we are glad to finally have a good breakfast place in Weston."}
{"text":"So two buddies are sitting there and one says \"I'd love to sell food at a massive profit margin!\"

Other says \"Eggs!\"

\"Eggsmart!!!!\"

Enough said. 

Save your money and preserve your local \"real\" greasy spoon."}
{"text":"The montreal Benny is good. The Freshly squeezed orange juice is sour in winter and I suspect watered down by the store bought. The 1 litre is almost the same as two glasses. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place hoping it will magically get better. Varied menu but food execution is poor. It's like the cooks don't care. How can a Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye be drowning in grease? Why can't these places do fresh cut fries? The waitress is nice enough just overworked and forgetful. I guess I'm insane."}

{"text":"Unfortunately our Breakfast of French Toast was cold and we had to ask for water several times.
We were looking forward to our meal since this place was recommend to us as it's fairly new in our neighbourhood.
Disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst \"breakfast\" I never had. Stay far away from this dirty \"restaurant.\"

The staff are not trained and generally useless.

The establishment itself needs a good clean, the plates are questionable, the coffee mugs were filthy, the butter in the little bowl had bread crumbs and egg in it.

The coffee is so weak - after two milks it tasted like milk water.

The cook wasn't wearing a hair net...

I ordered over-medium eggs - got runny, cold mush with broken yokes. They made them again - got solid yokes, eggs cooked to a crisp. The rest of my plate had gone cold - they didn't even keep it warm. (I was very hungry) I asked for a third attempt and told her to remake make cold plate - fucked up the whole order this time. I told her to forget about my food. She charged us for everything instead of at least giving me my orange juice free of charge. If I had exact change I would have given that. I'm upset at the 1.14$ tip she got.

This place needs to be shut down ASAP. I will be calling the health department; I have no idea how they passed the first time."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I am hesitant to even give 1 star, but unfortunately that is the lowest one I can give. Service... did not exist.
I was charged for decaf coffee - which I never ordered. I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. I ordered the grilled chicken salad, which quite literally ended up being a mountain of iceberg lettuce, 4 thin slices of tomato and 2 slices of cucumber with 7 tiny strips of processed chicken that was ice cold.

The salad didn't come with dressing which I had to ask for. It turned out to be a $10 head of lettuce. I ended going to the Shopper's next door to get a frozen pizza.  Ive never left a restaurant without tipping before. Will be avoiding eggsmart from now on."}
{"text":"Pathetic. Arrived at 7am on our way to visit our daughter at nearby Sick Kids hospital. Walked in and immediately was approached by owner (?) telling us they were closed for half an hour because their \"order just came in.\" Incredulous, I remarked, \"what the h*ll? Your a breakfast place that isn't open in the morning?\"

 Maybe a bit inappropriate, but here I am carrying luggage and other assorted things for my daughter's room. A break would have been appreciated.

Anyway, after unsuccessfully trying to make him see the ridiculousness of a breakfast restaurant unprepared to serve breakfast we left to the sound if the door locking behind us...and the \"open\" signs still blinking in the windows."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend wanted to go out for breakfast and wanted to go to eggsmart because one just opened up near our house, so off we go. 
First off we got seated right awy despite being fairly busy, and the waitress was very nice got our drinks fast. We ordered our food and it came quite quickly. 
I would like the compliment the waitress, I heard her telling others it was her first day on the job, but she was WONDERFUL, attentive enough as to not be annoying, and I heard her talking to the elderly couple next to us and she seeme quite sweet. 
Next note before getting to the food, it was BOILING in there, like I mean I was sitting in a sauna kinda hot. I was actually getting naseous from time to time because I was trying to eat hot food while sitting in a steam box. 
The food however was just kinda boring....I got french toast, nothing wonderful, the french toast I make at home is better. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs combo, he ate all the steak but did note that it was no medium rare as ordered and needed much HP sauce (this might just be because he's a condiment junkie). I tried both his eggs and \"home fries\" - the home fries were slightly mushy in some parts and then slightly undercooked in others. Not  a fan I must say. I would have rather gone around the corner to our normal breakfast spot. The eggs were decent though, our other friend who joined us later had no compliants. 
The powder on the home fries tasted like the beef boullion cubes you get in a mr. noodles package which I found odd....
Overall, maybe I'd go again if I'm craving breakfast (as they serve it all day) and try something with meat in it"}
{"text":"@ 12:30PM Wednesday December 13th.

I, a local business owner walks into Egg Smart and informs the staff that there are a couple small but slippery patches of black ice just out front of their establishment. The cook seems to care. The shorter black haired lady working there doesn't show me much concern or appreciation at all. 

I tell her, \"I believe legally it's EggSmart's responsibility so you should probably take care of that.\" I exit the establishment. I hear her call out to me on the street \"What ice are you talking about?\" She's standing at the door looking down at the very patches that exist. I point it out. She flips her palm up \"Well we do have salt down so there's nothing much we can do about it.\" I say \"Don't you care if some old lady comes by and slips and falls?\" \"She says. I'm just inquiring. No need to be rude.\" I turn to leave as she continues \"You come in and start complaining at me...\" I can't hear the rest because I'm crossing the street.

If I were the owner I'd be ashamed and appalled and would fire this person for displaying such apathy and disrespect to someone who took the time to come in to offer help. I have nothing to gain from \"complaining\" and the fact that she views this as a complaint says a lot. I actually cared that someone may slip and fall and hurt themselves, so I decided to do something about it. This server felt differently I suppose. I don't care to be served by people who genuinely show no care of concern for their fellow citizens and neighbours."}
{"text":"I have been to about 3 Eggsmart locations and this one is by far the best.  I haven't been here lately because I changed my diet but the time I have been here it was 5 star food quality and service and the price is right."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast experience I have had. Horrible service, rude owners and extremely understaffed. Our order took an hour to come out and had to be sent back four more times because it was incorrect. When we got the bill there was an extra meal that we didn't order. We tried to speak to the owners about the bad service, one made excuses and walked away mid sentence and the other threatened to call the police for the meal that we didn't order?!?! In the end we ate meals we didn't order because we just wanted it to end."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today because it's right around the corner from where I work. 
I didn't have very high expectations (or should I say eggspectations), but I was still disappointed. 

Everything is really, really dirty. The walls are splattered with food and everything is greasy to the touch. After being led to my table and pulling out a chair, I saw that there was a wet splotch of food on it. The other chair doubly so.

The food is exactly what you would expect for a greasy spoon breakfast place, as is the service. I was welcomed and seated, but the waitress never came back over except to take the bowl of milks and creams on my table (without acknowledging me at all) to give to another table.

The biggest disappointment, however, was the lack of tiny jams. I don't know if you have to ask for them or pay extra, but they're not on the table where they usually are at breakfast joints. That in itself was -1 star for me, but I really like jam."}
{"text":"We walked in at 945... Walked out at 10:15. 
In th is half hour we got our own menus, including kids menus (they finished all activities on kids menu). 

There was one large group and a couple small tables... No valid reason for is waiting a half hour. 

The hostess who could have helped get orders from waiting patrons opted to just watch everyone get agitated. 

This doesn't speak to Eggsmart but speaks volumes of THIS location."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, we experienced awful service. The waitress ignored us, finally sat us down, dumped a couple of menus on us and walked off. When we ordered coffee, my wife asked if they had soy milk and she abruptly barked, \"No\" and walked off again. We left immediately and let her know why. Try Creme de la Creme down the street instead.

If you make customers feel like they're inconveniencing you, then you're not going to have much luck in this game."}
{"text":"Service was a sweet young lady, got lots of coffee refills, and the coffee was good enough to drink black. The prices looked a bit high but the plates were pretty big portions. Nothing fancy, but in a convenient location."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go for breakfast or brunch any time of the week. Great quality AND quantity of bacon and sausages. Eggs perfectly prepared any way you want, plus bottomless coffee that you never have to call for.Home fries or fruit comes with it and not skimpy. And you can actually have conversations without shouting; the noise level is low. Pleasant friendly greetings when you walk in the door and again when you leave. Makes you think of home with Mama in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This Eggsmart is amazing! I have been hear countless times seeing its right across from my station. A hungry Paramedic is a grumpy one! 
The service is quite pleasant, the menu has really ballooned since they began to serve lunch. The prices are quite reasonable, infant more affordable then most surrounding breakfast joints. Omelettes are a tad dry for my taste. The \"scramblers\" are delicious and the freshly squeezed orange juice is essential!! All in all great experience with great food. Weekend mornings are always busy at any breakfast place so don't knock on them for that ;)"}
{"text":"Even though I knew about the low rates of the place, I still wanted to give it a shot, but maybe I shouldn't have. We went with a kid, he is a nice kid and doesn't make much noise. Sometimes he'd like to get up, walk around quietly or just stand up somewhere. The huge guy waiter told us that he reminds of himself when he was a kid except that his mum used to use a leash for him! This was extremely rude!!! I doubt there were leashes used for kids for the time he was a baby anyway, but we tried to take it as a friendly chit chat. After a few minutes he asks us to keep our kid seated. And that is while our kid was walking next to our table in a very civilised manner and wasn't running around or anything like that. And they claim they are kid friendly! 
I ordered pancakes, they were dry and hard to swallow. No cream or any sort of fruit on the side!"}
{"text":"Our favourite brunch hotspot is Cora, but we opted for something closer to home one Saturday morning. I'm pretty picky, so I chose to go with the chicken caesar wrap on the lunch menu. My boyfriend got some traditional breakfast affair with eggs and bacon and sausage.

The salad that came with my wrap was barely edible and the wrap itself was just OK. It wasn't the worst I'd ever had, but I make a much better one at home. My boyfriend said his food was OK too. The portions were smaller than Cora, but it was also about $10 less for the two of us.

The service was horrendous. A girl who looked to be maybe 16 (but was likely 18, due to government regulations) took our order and then disappeared. She never came around for drink refills or to ask how our food was. She literally dropped off our food - didn't announce either dish, as is standard with the industry - and that was it. We stacked our dishes, put our coats on, asked for the bill at the counter and paid debit for it there, too. It wasn't even busy. I think there were two other tables there, both of whom were there long before us.

Some people want the cheap, easy, low-quality breakfast that Eggsmart has to offer. We don't go out often, so when we do, we want something good. This did not meet our standards. We definitely will not be going back, and have no desire to try a different location."}
{"text":"I go to this eggsmart often simply because coras is too busy or I don't want to drive furthur for lunch. The pancakes have always been dry or hard. The toast often burnt. If I didn't live so close I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. If you dont want to be disapointed on your dining experience..this is the place to go for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"My experience was great. The service was good and fast. It took us 2 min to order and 10 min to get the food in a full packed Saturday morning. I got the meatlover omelette with home fries. It was good and well done. The price was reasonable too. I think I will go back there again."}
{"text":"I wish that my family had never gone here. The service was horrible and we didn't even get to order before we left.

The lady that didn't bother to show us a table for five, told us to get another chair for ourselves from another table. What's up with that?!

If you thought that we'd even rate the food, we'd have to tell you that we were forgotten by the waitress who had told us that we would be able to order.

A few minutes later, nothing. 15 minutes later, we left for another food joint.

Thumbs down on this nasty, dirty, run-down dump."}
{"text":"Decided to go to for lunch with my mom because it is fairly new. We ordered our drinks & my mom got her tea right away but It took them 20 minutes to give me my coffee..and I had to ask 3 times until I finally got it and it wasn't even busy in there. Staff was very nice but a little slow. Food was good also."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast (brunch??) on a Wednesday morning and ordered the Chunky Monkey pancakes and the chocolate chip waffles with a side of bacon.  The pancakes were really sweet and they were a bit on the dry side. The waffles were alright and the bacon was crispy.

I recommend getting something savory to balance the sweetness of the waffles and pancakes!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice.  First time I ordered the classic breakfast.  It was okay, could have been warmer.  The second time, I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and tea.  Much better than the first time. I have other places I'd rather go to for breakfast, but if I'm in the area, I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"I must of been high coming in to this place what a dirty dive.
$ 2.55 for a regular black coffee.
Its not good at all. Lots of shady customers. 
We had a sip from are coffee and left there prices are not cheap. 
Spend a $1 or $2 and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is truly a dump and I regret spending my money here. Ordered eggs Benedict with peameal bacon and ended up getting a dish that basically looked like vomit...absolutely disgusting, I couldn't finish it.  I have to admit after taking a look at the short order cooks, I should have just walked out. Save your money and try another location...avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Wow, biggest omelet i ever had

I'm stuffed

Pickle barrel center point still closed.
Fry basket i can't stand
Spent the extra 2 min drive here

Well worth it"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Lots of egg options. Pancake and coffees. Kids had fun and so did the adults.
Food presentation could be a little better. But the taste is great."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food took over 35mins and it wasn't busy, requested to have my French toast after my meal but they made it first and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Our friends suggested we meet here for Sunday lunch. On arrival we noticed a huge problem....parking. Or lack thereof. Since this location is on the corner of 2 busy main streets, parking on the street is impossible. That leaves only the neighbouring businesses' lots....really unfair to them and a bad idea all around. Really unfortunate because the rest of the meal turned out fine.
Although busy, we were seated quickly and the staff was some of the best we have had for this type of eatery. Very friendly and efficient. The selection was good, as was the portion size. And the price affordable.
Overall, worth a try if you are willing to wait for a parking spot, or hope you get lucky and don't have to."}
{"text":"Breakfast here at Eggsmart is actually perfect for one of those mornings where you just want a simple breakfast. Nothing extravagant, but the food here is served in perfect portions. I'll definitely be back. Not bad prices either!"}
{"text":"Fresh, clean, great service. I always get the classic breakfast, scrambled with turkey bacon. Servers are extremely polite. Lots of healthy options on the menu. This is one of the best Eggsmart franchises"}
{"text":"Was there for the second time last week-end, and the service was once again rather terrible. They forgot my guest's request for spicy ketchup so after her potatoes got cold, she asked for it again and got it at that point. The server took a while to drop off the bill to the table, and then when she did she never picked up my credit card so we went to pay at the front, where there seemed to be some confusion as our server had accidentally already closed our table.

The food there is decent, but 2 out of 2 times the service has been very bad. Mind you it was the same server who helped us both times, so we haven't had much of an opportunity to see how the others were, but it's enough to know we're not returning there for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"The staff are all super kind, friendly and very effiencent! Iv always been more than happy with my food and service! prices are great aswell!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and spacious. Not bad though. 
Service wise: 9/10 , no complaints. 
Food wise: 9/10, good not bad at all. 
Wait time wise: 8/10. 
Ive been here once only, with my man and son. 
Not bad after all.. will come back again."}
{"text":"Food is average nothing to write home about. My \"extra fruit\" bowl wasn't too fresh and there was some brown stuff laced through it, I think it was Nutella..? Not very appetizing. We found a very dirty fork that was with fresh cutlery, a little scary for hygiene. Server is nice and attentive made sure she checked on us frequently. The fresh orange juice was lovely. Not my favourite place to go for breakfast but my father in law loves it."}
{"text":"Today I have diarrhea from this place. I like eggsmart but this location didn't work out for me. The dish I was served didn't look right. I got the same thing I got at the other place and it didn't taste as good, it looked way less well prepared. The sauce looked strangely runny, the potatoes not as well done, and I was served less fruit on the side. The other eggsmart I was at was on Shepard and bayview I believe and it was incredible - but this was not great. The steak too.. Not as good. And yea... This morning I'm not having fun."}
{"text":"It's not an above average breakfast.  It's below average.  Quite frankly I can make the exact same breakfast better at home.  What they made me was easy to make and it was not even made well."}
{"text":"I ordered on skip the dishes and the amount of money I spent on the scrambler ($15) was ok for me but the amount of food was pathetic. The scrambler barely had 1 egg, let alone 3. There was barely even one potato worth of home fries. Terrible and ill never order again. 

What I got was ok, but for $15 for breakfast I should have just gone to Reds or any other place. Should have known better than to order from a place near a truck stop. The potatoes weren't crispy, the eggs were watery. I asked for over easy instead of scrambled and they sent scrambled. The only good part was the two slices of fresh avocado. I waited an hour for the food and it wasn't hot, not even slightly warm. The hollandaise was cold. I had to heat up the food when it got here. Just sad.

Maybe eating in is better but you should provide better service to skip the dishes customers."}
{"text":"Went today for a third time to see.  First time was ok, second time a customer was having a loud argument with the manager.  
Today it was crowded, waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Table was  covered in pancake syrup, menu was stuck to it.  When the waitress brought my food, I had to ask again to clean the table.  The potatoes and scrambled eggs were cold.  The eggs were over cooked and tough.  I can only imagine they cooked them ahead to keep up with the crowd. Nobody came around to ask if I wanted more coffee or anything else. 
 I had to go up to the waitress to get water and butter for pancakes.  

This is a shame as there is nothing any where close that serves breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday morning and had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a seat. It gets to be pretty busy and noisy in here, so it's not the best place for intimate conversation. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was pretty good. I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs to be done and they were not runny like I'm used to. Overall, sort of a \"meh\" experience and will only go here for brunch when absolutely starving. There are better places in the city for that kind of price!"}
{"text":"Under cooked potatoes, oversized price and incredibly slow service."}
{"text":"Service was bad they did not come to see if we needed refills of coffee or water. I had a few potatos that were bad they had a moldy tast to them. We also stood at the counter for  about 8 minutes to pay. I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"My first time here I would have given it 1 star but It had just opened and I wanted to give it another shot. 

So a year went by and man has it improved! The food was awesome such good portions. Food was cooked perfectly. 

Staff was very friendly.

The only thing I didn't like was the orange juice was $5 a glass. I've had fresh squeezed oj before and it wasn't so expensive. A little sad about that. But as long as you go there and don't order oj your good.

Overall I loved it and will be back"}
{"text":"I went twice to Eggsmart and today would mark my third time. Their breakfasts are nice. I usually have the Eggwhite scrambler as the size is avarage however their meals tend to be on the larger side. The atmosphere is very casual. The place is fairly clean. The one thing that keeps changing is the service. The first time i went the service was excellent despite the place being full and crowded. The second time however it was not at crowded and the service was horrible. I was told they couldn't serve hot milk? Apparently they don't have the 'machine' to heat it. The server was a bit rude for my liking and very lazy. However that won't stop me from going there as it does offer a nice variety of breakfasts."}
{"text":"Don't ask for fruit. My bf ordered an omelette with fruit instead of fries. He got rotten strawberries with 4 blueberries and an extra 4$ on his bill. Worst error, next time he'll ask for their greasy fries."}
{"text":"This place is my cheaper-than-Cora's alternative (right across the street). The price is cheaper because you get less awesome fruits and the potatoes/home fries are not tasty plus they add some odd tasting spices on it. I never use ketchup but with their fries I will, just so I don't taste their seasonings. The other food items I've tried (like my favourite eggs benedict) is average. Service isn't bad. Coffee refills happen frequently enough if you're into that. Not much in terms of fresh fruit juices.  I feel like if you're going to brunch, you might as well pay the extra dollar or two for Cora's unless there is something unique here I missed. I guess there is the cheaper \"diner\" feel, but then if you go for that angle, it's still quite expensive for what you get.

(And yes, this was a Tim Hortons, but it didn't close down. It's just up the street!)"}
{"text":"This is a small place, so get there early or for a late meal if you're there for breakfast. The service is fast. The servers are friendly and efficient. The food is excellent and affordable."}
{"text":"Have only been on Sundays for lunch, however the food is extremely quick and pretty good quality for the price you're paying. The servers are always ridiculously friendly and will remember you after even just one visit if you make an impression.
One star down because the pancakes honestly aren't the greatest - however, the specialty pancakes make up greatly for it. Would recommend trying to get a substitute instead of the plain ones."}
{"text":"There was only one server for my side of the restaurant which had a total of 9 occupied tables for a Saturday morning so the service was very slow. The quality of food had gone down tremendously. The steak was very dry. The home fries were very clumpy and broken up in small chunks. We ordered a side order of sweet potato fries and they were very greasy and salty. Some customers got up and left after waiting too long for the server to come take their orders. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"Meh. Had the \"meat scrambler\". Kind of overpriced. Wife had club house - chicken isn't very good. The ketchup in the Heinz bottle doesn't take like heinz. Could be wrong. 

So my wife and I sent back more food than arrived.  No one seemed to question it.  When they asked how it was and we replied \"Meh.\" and \"so-so\" there was no reply. 

Clean enough place. Server appeared once to take order, once to deliver food.   Had to flag her down to get the bill.  

Don't think I will repeat. 

Again, wish I had checked Yelp&Urbanspoon before going.  All the Eggsmarts seem to have generally poor ratings."}
{"text":"Feel so good to have a full breakfast before the start of a day. There's an early bird special for a good breakfast at $5.99, which includes 3 eggs, a choice of ham or sausages, fruits, 4 slices of toasts, and a choice of home fries or French fries. The breakfast is so big that I could share it with my husband and both of us are full at the end.

The breakfast comes with a slice or orange and a slice of cantaloupe. They are sweet like honey. The eggs are perfectly done to my request, sunny side up. I always request for French Fries which I like them more than home fries. French Fries are crispy and taste better to my preference. There's always refill for coffee.

The service is good. The waitress remembers what we like and what we want to order. The good service makes me feel like home."}
{"text":"3 stars, right down the middle. This characterless chain serves perfectly average breakfasts. The eggs were fried, the bread was toasted, the potatoes boiled then fried, and the coffee was...poured.

Put it all together and you get their \"Classic Breakfast\", 5.39 without meat, 6.99 with bacon, ham or sausage. (7.99 w peameal bacon). Add 1.99 for a bottomless cup o' joe."}
{"text":"We got our coffee 15mins after ordering. The food took too long so we just paid for the coffee and left. If you come to this restaurant be prepared to wait 30min minimum."}
{"text":"What is lower than 1 star? Terrible! When I first walk in there was a lady and a man smoking outside the door. Instantly smoke went into my face. I walk in quickly. No one was there. I said \"hello?\" Someone behind me said \"hi\"... it was the lady smoking when I walked in. She was the waitress. Behind her walking in was the cook! Holy! What terrible service. Food was okay. Price is fine. I'll go back if I don't have to walk through smoke."}
{"text":"I have to say the staff is fantastic at this location. I came in with my wife for a late Sunday lunch, without realizing they were just about ready to close up for the day. We were still served, without rushing, and had fresh home fries made for us. 

The food is quality, as to be expected from any Eggsmart location."}
{"text":"I came in to this restaurant on a Monday for brunch.  I was so impressed with this restaurant.  I had a western omelette it was delicious.  It was nice and hot and very reasonably priced.  It was one of their specials.  I really enjoyed my meal.  This restaurant was not too busy.  It was very clean and the service was fast.  My new place to come for brunch.  I will definitely at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and have had mixed experiences. Fortunately the prices are more than reasonable, so I can excuse some things in exchange for a lower price.

The first time my food was good and tasty. However, I had something rather simple: the scrambled egg basic breakfast.

The second time I ate there the food was less tasty. I had the eggs benedict w/ham. The hollandaise was too thick and separating and the eggs were overcooked, solid all the way through. The taste was still decent, but not the best eggs benny I've had in this town.

Both times the potatoes were good. Nothing ground breaking, but good flavor and a nice amount.

On both trips the wait staff have been extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I never really liked chain restaurants but being a Civic Holiday, not many places are opened. The four of us came by for breakfast, waited 5-10 minutes for a table which was fine, seeing how busy they were. Our server made an effort to bring us water, menus and our drink order before running off to other tables (thank you).
I ordered the baja benedict (a new item) which consist of salsa, avocado, hollandaise sauce, green pepper and jalapeno pepper served with potatoes. I can never finish any of their portions because they're quite big so I usually share with my mom. 
There's nothing special about their food. It's decent, fresh and always made quickly so no complaints there. Would come back for breakfast if nothing else is opened/I am in the area."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the service here. 

we came here for brunch, (should say
lunch) and the restaurant only had one other couple there.

the waitress came over and because we knew what we wanted we ordered right away. He got eggs Benny with turkey bacon and soft eggs I got just the eggs Benny with soft eggs.

- our order was wrong, she gave us hard eggs
- seeing as the restaurant was empty, she could have come over to see if we needed anything, she never did.
we had to ask for more water and juice 

she didn't even come over to ask if everything was okay after we finished we had to ask for the bill. 

truly disappointed. I'll stick to the eggsmart on Kennedy and 401 for my breakfast fix."}
{"text":"this place is fairly busy every-time I go! 
I always get the same thing, eggs Benny with Turkey bacon. 

the service here is hit and miss, sometimes they get your order on point and other times they go left field with it. 

I suggest sitting on the right side of the restaurant, always had better service there."}
{"text":"I should have believed the star rating here on Yelp! Ordered from here because my regular breakfast place was closed. I ordered for take out: bacon, sausage and French toast.  I had to throw half the French toast away because it wasn't cooked all the way through!! Bacon and sausage was decent. Not ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Terrible location. Waited 20 minutes to be seated, got a filthy and sticky table, miserable server that treated us like we were an inconvenience. Took one hour for the food to arrive and when it did, we were missing a meal. Another 20 minute wait for that meal to arrive and the bacon was 100% raw and the home fries black and burnt. We told the server and she was huffing and puffing as if we were out of line to ask for edible food. After the change in owners, it's gone downhill. Will never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"It seems like at 9 am on a Sunday morning, this is one of the first places to be open, so it had gotten busy. The two waitresses were scrambling, and doing the best they can, so I have no complaint about the service.

The food itself... well, it is quite expensive for what it is. I ordered a meat-lover omelet made by egg whites, and a double shot espresso. The bill came to $18. I can think of a lot better places with more generous quantity of food to eat at for that kind of price."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fresh and delicious !

 I've been to several eggsmart locations in the past. My general impression from these collective experiences can be characterised as the following:

 \"lacking freshness \"  \"fluctuating quality\" \"grease spoon\" and \"grime city\"

Yes. Its not good. 

But this location is ! 

We ordered the Baja Benny with a side of soup and southwest scramble with a side of salad. 
 Everything looked and tasted fresh. The 
chicken noodle soup had large pieces of chicken breast and veggies to boot. The broth  tasted homemade and hearty. The eggs were poached perfectly on the Benny, and they weren't scant on the avocado; each side of the Benny had half an avocado. The hollandaise sauce was well balanced and not too tangy or salty. 

The southwest scramble was an interesting dish and also had half an avocado placed on top. The veggies in the salad were super fresh and the portions were good. 

The food took a while to get on the table , but seeing as they only had one chef on staff , and one waitress, with around 8 tables in the restaurant, I wouldn't hold that against this place.

In fact, the service was actually pretty efficient despite the lack of staffing. The waitress was well organized and approached us immediately, and the food, though slow, still came out looking finessed - good job Eggsmart !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was ridiculously slow. It took me 15 minutes to get water and a menu, 30 minutes to get my coffee and 45 minutes to get 3 eggs. I don't know what my waitress occupied with, she only had 5 tables in her section to tend to. First we ordered two waters to start with. She came out with one cup after and we didn't get the second cup until 10 minutes later"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and enjoyed the food both times. There is a big menu with lots of great selection to choose from. Portions are a healthy size that keep me full and for a reasonable price. There was the same waitress both times and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great but there was hairs (multiple hair in the ham and fries) in my food. They should practice good hygiene here. I doubt it if they even wash their hands. Gross! Not coming back here."}
{"text":"On a cool rainy Friday morning In May I visited this place with four co-workers on our last day working together to have a good breakfast. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading all the other reviews. This place looks like a 90s diner that has been in use since the 90s, with the modern widescreen TV being the only exception. I mean the door had a shattered pane of glass and all the wear and tear didn't make it seem like a place that I would normally visit. 

At 7:45am it was quite busy and appears that they tried to cram as many tables and chairs as they could. We tried to get a table for 6 but the only empty table large enough was right beside the door. Every time someone came in or left I would feel a cold sting during a chilly morning as I was sitting right by the door, literally.

Our server was very friendly. I didn't get coffee because I knew that I was going to have some later in the day so he got me some water without asking. This location doesn't have the early bird special. Our orders must have taken 15-20mins to arrive. I ordered what I think is called the classic breakfast for $8.49 which was scrambled eggs with sausage as my choice and it came with buttery white toast and potatoes on the side. I didn't care for the thin slice of fruit, but the breakfast was delicious, filling and just the way I wanted it. I wouldn't usually shell out that much just for breakfast, but if you can get past the atmosphere this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I order a meal it came back mess up and the worker keeps giving me the run around the chef was disrespectful."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, nothing too fancy, cooked well, great service! Hot cup of coffee in less than 1 min, food hit the table within 5 mins of ordering, in and out within 25 mins. Exactly what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Been to this Eggsmart a handful of times and I noticed they do not have enough workers working here.  They do not clean up the tables until it is needed which is gross as the old food can be sitting there for a while. The old lady that works there is super friendly and has the sweetest smile.  The food itself is mediocre at best.  We tried the egg Benedict with smoked salmon and it wasn't that good, the spinach and feta cheese omelette is tasteless but home fries was tasty.  The french toast portion is huge but nothing special.  I did like the Banquet burger they offered as it was fresh and juicy.  I ordered the hot chocolate and they but a huge whip cream on top which I didn't mind but I would like to be asked if I wanted the whip first.  Overall, it is decent but needs more staff and service needs to improve.  Can't really mess up breakfast as it is just eggs and toast.  Nothing really stands out to me compare to other places.  Pricing is expensive for just eggs and toast so I do not normally go out for breakfast.  I think I rather  go get one of the Timmies breakfast sandwich instead.

{"text":"Nothing wow, it's just ok we had the benedictines far from being one of the best ones I've tried.
Washrooms are super dirty,it's disgusting."}
{"text":"i went to this location with my friend, the food was ok, but we waited soooooo long at the table for our order. the waiters and waitresses are sooooo inefficient and it also took their kitchen forever to get the food done, i won't come to this location any more"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday morning. it was a holiday for most people. It was not too busy, however the kitchen was very behind. The woman who sat us informed us that it would be about a 20 minute wait because the kitchen was behind. It is quite small in there and I think that the tables get in the way of walking space. At the time there were only 2 kitchen staff working. I had asked for freshly squeezed orange juice, and it was delicious. But it came to me very warm... I had to ask for some ice. Did not give us cream/milk with the coffee and did not give us the tray with the jams when she served our bread. When the food finally did come it was pretty good. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This Eggsmart has been around the block for quite awhile. Today was my first visit and I was skeptical due to its 2/5 star rating, but still wanted to try and give it more justice myself.

Just upon arrival, I was surprised how occupied and busy this location is yet so few reviews were written. Turns out, majority were more families and seniors so I can understand. Nevertheless, we were greeted sincerely and our server had a very cheerful attitude - totally thumbs up! 

I ordered an Eggs Benedict with Peameal Bacon while my other half got the Big Breakfast. On top, we got a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and apple juice. The orange juice was $5! That was one item I felt overpriced.

My eggs benny was good. The hollandaise sauce was pleasant but not overwhelming overall taste, while the egg itself was boiled just right. Peameal bacon was slightly more cooked than I wanted. As for their home fries, it was slightly fried on the outside only and inside was like normal potato.

PS. Their fruits are really delicious and sweet!

Everything was nice, service was great and place was clean. Nevertheless, we shouldn't be expecting \"out of the world\" food from a chain restaurant.

Lastly, I enjoyed my time at Eggsmart :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service , fast food, friendly staff, clean environment, quiet and respectful atmosphere...best eggsmart location I've been to :D"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast. Unhygienic. I would not eat here again even if there was a zombie apocalypse."}
{"text":"They have come a long way. My previous review was a 1 but the food lately has been superb. Try the skyscraper!!"}
{"text":"2.5/5

I love breakfast food. But don't eat red meat or pork. This leaves eggs, toast fruit and home fries as the dishes to try. I think it's decent. It's convinient, close and a lot better service than Markham station."}
{"text":"I was here just after 7am on Monday morning. I was tired and had a headache but the waitress named Sharon (dark curly hair and glasses) is one of the nicest and sweetest people you could ever meet. Her attitude and mood is amazing and will turn your frown upside down. I wish more people were like her.
To be honest I would come back here (far from home) just to have her as my waitress again.
Thank you Sharon for being so nice and having such a great and positive attitude!

To the owners: Sharon the waitress is your biggest asset and you should give her a raise and do whatever to keep her happy because she will bring lots of business"}
{"text":"Horrible service... Waited 45 min never got our food... It wasn't even that busy... All I wanted was breakfast...Then I was expected to pay $14 for orange juice and really bad coffee.... Unfortunately I will never go back there again... On another note went to Boston pizza instead and received amazing service..."}
{"text":"We go here out of convenience due it's close proximity to our home. The food is above average standard breakfast chain food. You are going to a chain and paying $7-$14 a meal, what do you expect?

The servers are often stretched quite thin so in turn end up running around like crazy trying to get everything done. The clientele they have to deal with is often less than savoury given it's close proximity to the \"hood\". Even so they are extremely friendly, they remember our name, our order, and are always awake, alert, attentive and friendly.

We keep returning because of the friendly staff, location and the consistent, to be expected, reasonably priced, standard breakfast food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast places to go to. Family owned and operated so I know they care about their food and service. My go to waitress is Julie, she's always friendly and she knows the menu inside out. They have a huge selection of different items in the menu so there's something for everyone. Been coming in here for a few years now and they have never disappointed. What separate this place from other breakfast joints is the service. Will always have my business as long as the owner doesn't sell the place."}
{"text":"Checked out this new place in the neighbourhood by a fluke.  My friend and I intended on having lunch at another diner, but at the last minute we changed our minds and stumbled upon Eggsmart.

I had grilled chicken breast with salad and fries, oh and all the coffee I could drink.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  Well grilled I should say.  My friend had poached eggs with home fries and some bacon.  He was very satisfied with his choice. And on top of the deliciousness, the prices were great.

Being a new business, everything was very clean and the service was great.  If they can keep this up I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've returned a few more times since my last review- and I have to say it was the exact same each time.
Consistent service, crappy coffee, yummy freshly squeezed juice and a typical greasy breakfast. 
It's Eggsmart- if you're looking for a mom and pop restaurant you're in the wrong place. But it's similar to what you'd expect from a golden griddle- only way less terrible.
It is what it is- give it a try."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. It's nothing special, but what they do make, they make well. Servers and cooks are quick and efficient. The person cleaning tables was on top of things. Pricing is average for a breakfast place. It's a small place, so if there's a line, it could be awhile.

My omelette was huge and full of toppings. My man said the eggs benny was alright, not the greatest he'd had, but not a bad dish. Homefries were good and I ate all of them, but didn't finish my omelette. Oops.

Close to where I live, so it's an easy choice for a breakfast out."}
{"text":"Price went up, it's overpriced for the quality of food now. There are plenty of similarly priced options to consider just minutes away. The old pricing was a strong selling point of this chain."}
{"text":"I don't like this franchise at all. Eggs are bland, not smart. It should be called EggBland. The staff is generally nice, but the quality in general is bad. I've gone to a few locations and it's pretty much the same. If you want to go to a breakfast place, try a mom and pop's type breakfast place or go to Sunset Grill instead. I'm actually surprised EggBland is a successful business to be quite honest."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ... ok... but the service was indifferent for me, slightly less chilly for others. I could chalk it up to fatigue and end of day ennuie I suppose.  Frankly,  depressing to be there.  But at least it wasn't expensive or incompetent. It's worth paying a little more for better atmosphere.

I do want to acknowledge that whoever is in the kitchen seems to care about what s/he is doing"}
{"text":"To be honest, i really like the food there, and the service is good, most of time. Deduct one star just to share one visit that i really disappointed.

It was approx. two weeks ago, myself and my friend were having brunch at this place, everything was perfect as usual. 

There was a Chinese waitress serving us. We haven't finished our meal but she gave us our bill, which was OK. HOWEVER, on the bill, she already put 15% as tips and gave straight to us. At the first glance, I thought amount was wrong as it's more expensive then we ordered, later on i realized she's already put the tips amount on the bill, this made me and my friend really uncomfortable. I think tips is still voluntary based right? Although 15% is kinda standard as starting point, how can you just take it granted and put it on the bill and gave straight to us?

My friend and I guessed that, maybe it's because we are both Chinese and so is she. She knew that Chinese customer in general pays less tips, so she used this method to \"softly force\" us to pay \"the standard tips\". We still paid, after all, as we usually did. but this one off experience really disappointed us as we really don't think it's appropriate."}
{"text":"Found a disgusting piece of long blue lint in my toast. When I brought it to the attention of the waitress she said, \"Oh, it's just from the kitchen towel. They were probably wiping the counter and touched your toast with the towel.\" She said this as if it should somehow comfort me. Never going back again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I'd never been to an Eggsmart before, so I thought I'd give their new Brampton location a whirl, as it's very close to where I live, and opens up at 7am, which is perfect. 

Being new, it's obviously spotless inside, and they had recently decorated for Halloween as well, with crows all over the place, and I took a seat at a booth, complete with pumpkin and skull place-mats. It should also be noted that they offer free Wifi, and have a couple of plasma TV's hanging to entertain.

There was only one other customer in there, so service was swift and courteous. I ordered their 'big' breakfast, which consists of 2 pancakes, 2 pieces of ham, 2 bacon strips, 2 sausage links, 2 eggs, 2 slices of toast, and fries, which makes it bigger than the usual breakfast I order when eating at Dennys, and for practically the same price (around 10 dollars).

I knew I was in for a treat the moment the smell wafted over from the kitchen, which is out in the open, about 10 feet from where I was sitting. I have to say, for a quickie breakfast, I was very impressed. The ham, sausages, and bacon were perfectly cooked, the pancakes were fluffy, the toast un-burnt, and the fries were the right kind of crispy. The eggs could've been a little better, but they were still way better than what Dennys offers. By the time I got to the pancakes, I was actually concerned (for the first time ever with breakfast) that I may not be able to finish, but I think there was some kind of divine pancake intervention going on. God wanted me to have maximum pancasm, and I did.
The server wasn't intrusive at all, and was quick with the bill when I asked.

Wonderfully kickass breakfast for 10 dollars? Oh, you know I'll return."}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff. Breakfast was a very good portion. Enjoyed the fries and coffee immensely!"}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch with a couples of girls and overall had a good time. The server was friendly and professional as well as quick and efficient. As for the food, I have been to several franchise and this was definitely fresh and more flavourful than some other locations midtown of Toronto.  Atmosphere was kept clean and tidy and music is softly playing in the background."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the basics (or even slightly above) this place will definitely do the trick. Affordable prices, wide selection and super fast and friendly service. 
I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Decent food for decent prices. Usually, I'd order the steak and eggs or eggs benedict. Once I ordered a burger, and that was pretty good. Good services.

Quality: 6.5/10. Services: 7/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 6.5/10."}
{"text":"This place opens pretty early and I love coming here for breakfast-- super affordable and it fills you up quickly. The servers are generally very nice. They have traditional breakfasts like eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, etc... So if you're expecting very fancy dishes, I wouldn't recommend this place. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice here which is super yum."}
{"text":"Went there this morning to grab a quick bite to eat with a friend. Beyond horrible service. First of all after ordering coffee we were told there would be a thirty minute delay. Thinking we had nowhere to be we agreed and ordered. Coincidently approximately two minutes after ordering I received a call saying I had to be somewhere so we called over our server to cancel our order and to give us the bills for the coffee. Got a very aggressive \"no\" and we were told that we would have to pay for our full meal price instead of just the coffees. I tired to explain that I did have to leave and that I was very sorry, however our server got more aggressive and rude towards the two of us. Long story short we did end up waiting for our food however on top of the horrible service, our meals looked poorly prepared, tasted bland and not so great. Only good part of breakfast was the coffee. Would not recommend, understaffed and rude employees. Try dooney's cafe beside this place, waaaayy better service and better food."}
{"text":"Service was very very slow considering we were just ordering breakfast and nothing really fancy. The food came out maybe after 40 min or so....the dishes were decent. We liked their breakfast sausages. It is a no frills breakfast place. They should just improve their service particularly food wait time."}
{"text":"Honestly the food here was bad. The potatoes were horrible, the eggs were bad waitress was very nice. Place was dead."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food. Super busy on the weekend, we waited more than half an hour to get seated. This area needs more brunch options."}
{"text":"The service has greatly improved since my last post.  Excellent server, food was good."}
{"text":"Great no nonsense breakfast! I love being able to order promptly and getting my food in good time. Your coffee cup will never be empty for more than a few minutes! Staff are friendly and you can always get a seat. Hidden away so you'll never be left waiting to be served. Give it a shot, if you want the basics done quickly and well, this is your spot."}
{"text":"They serve typical brunch and breakfast fare.  I had the usual breakfast with sausage and rye toast. Nothing mind blowing but the waiter was fantastic and the food was pretty good and way cheaper than other bougie brunch places.  I also especially love their home fries. Dunno how they make it but it's perfect."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I've been going there on a regular basis since they opened! The food is awesome, the service is above and beyond, and the prices are fantastic as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Usually I love their food but this location was horrible. We came in around 11am and were \"served\" by the most inattentive waitress. She forgot to bring part of my order, never came back to check on us etc. The ketchup was 100% expired, the restaurant was freezing and to top it all off the eggs were super overcooked, the bacon was as salty as the sea and uber greasy. Even the orange slices they provided were mushy. When we went up to pay our \"waitress\" tried to make small talk with us...the kind of small talk you make when your fishing for a tip.

Will absolutely never return to this location. If you are looking for a great Eggsmart with perfect food head on over to whitby. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"This Eggsmart is the best around. They are always serving fresh food that is cooked to perfection. The waitresses are always around and very on top of things (walking around with coffee, seeing how your meal is etc) I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a great place to enjoy a reasonably priced meal with super friendly and polite people."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this chain before and it was much better.  Food was poorly prepared...even ran out of milk at breakfast time. 

Also, they add some sort of yellow spice to the hash browns that was off to me. 

Will stick to looking for great independents rather than these chains that can be hit or miss depending on management."}
{"text":"Mmm I'm a bit confused as to how this place has such good ratings... Maybe lack of brunch places nearby?

The breakfasts here are made poorly and the hollandaise that I got was very odd in flavour and colour. Wasn't my favourite.
Food is rushed and the service is never good.

Unfortunately, not a fan :("}
{"text":"The 2 owners (brothers) are delightful. Everyone really is super friendly, but the owners specifically are very welcoming EVERY TIME. Food is great, service is even better."}
{"text":"The wait staff are incredibly unresponsive and rude. They leave people waiting at the door endlessly for seating. They are completely disinterested in resolving customer complaints. The customer service here is exceptionally poor and the quality of the food not much better. I wouldn't eat here if it was the last place on earth"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!! I stopped here on a road trip & I have to say everything was delicious & cooked to perfection. It's definitely a must have!"}
{"text":"The food is great and they have a fantastic customer service! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our late breakfast/lunch here. We ordered the bagel and lox plate( tomato, onion and capers )  and an order of eggs over easy with bacon and home fries .  Everything was tasty and filling ! 
The cook ( V) and the server (F)  are wonderful ! They are so very gracious and welcoming . They are keepers !!! Will definitely come back here the next time we come to Canada from NYC ."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with friends on weekend. Clean restaurant, our server was friendly and always smiling. I ordered meat lovers scramble and it was so tasteful. A friend of mine had Skyscraper pancake that she really enjoyed."}
{"text":"The food here doesn't taste bad, it's nice to eat breakfast here with a few friends or family here. The staff are kind, but it seems that they are quite understaffed as it does take quite a while to get their attention. Usually, it takes about 10-15 minutes for them just to hand us a menu, but now the menus are already on the table. Ordering takes about 10 minutes for them as well, and you're waiting for about 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive on your table."}
{"text":"mmmm not my best brunch/breakfast for lunch experience.
they just opened few weeks ago right next to our office so we went there for lunch.
I love egg benedicts so I ordered a vegetarian option that was not on the menu (the menu in general is not super veg friendly)

for some reason they give you an option of having the eggs hard,medium or soft which I never experienced before in any of the brunch places. bennies just always come soft - otherwise they're not bennies but hard boiled eggs on top of an english muffin,

the portion included only side of fries and two bennies with spinach. no slices of orange, no toast included. total of $9
the spinach somehow had very grassy taste. hollandaise sauce was too salty and flavorless... the whole food tasting experience was just blah.

on the other end the service was very nice and even though they confused my friend's order the replacement came in in matter of seconds and she was charged less. 

but I'm not going back for eggs... maybe will check pancakes or waffles."}
{"text":"This location has  the basic Eggsmart menu. The restaurant was clean and roomy. The staff were friendly and efficient. I would have no problem going back or recommending this location."}
{"text":"This location is new. When we visited it was open for about a week. The restaurant services the same menu as the rest of the chains. I always enjoy the food and this time was no exception. 

The wait staff was very enuthsiastic and friendly. The service was quick and professional, even when I spilled my full coffee all over the table.

I hope they can keep the same standards up. If so it's going to be a regular place for my wife an I."}
{"text":"It was the first time at an Eggsmart and I was very happy with the service and quality of food. Nice and clean and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"horrible service.. walked in with my daughter..There were 3 other tables being served and 1 server..The server was extremely slow.I had to ask for both regular menu and the kids menu.I had to even ask for the crayons...I had to even call her over to take my order after 10 minutes of waiting... we wanted Turkey bacon and she said they ran out...I walked out...after the terrible service, her saying she doesn't have what we want I didn't feel like giving them my service."}
{"text":"The line up here was pretty long when I went last Saturday afternoon but they really did a great job in making sure everything was running as smoothly as possible. That's something that I think many customers take for granted and don't realize how much effort that takes. Food came out at a reasonable time, my bacon was a little too crispy for my liking but it was so bad that I felt the need to complain. They also have this freshly squeezed orange juice i recommend for everyone to try. 

The prices are great and you get so much food. For four people we spent around $75 which is great considering we all took food home for later. I will most likely be back, especially because of the friendly service and fast pace!"}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant 3 chances and they failed each time. Each time we would go, us and every table around us would be complaining about bad service and badly executed dishes. I took the owner aside and calmly said why we wouldn't be paying for our awful meal which was 45 mins late and undercooked and she told us off. That's why restaurants go out of business. So sad. I really wish she would listen."}
{"text":"I fucking love this place. I come here w my bf all the time, and the lady recognizes us. The staff is super friendly, it's comfort brunch food, very home-y and rustic feel... I adore this place, and this place is indeed adorable :D they fill up your coffee before you're even halfway done with your mug, they give you relationship advice, man its like visiting an aunt's house! Love it love it!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure how and/or why we ended up with a place that \"specializes\" in what greasy spoons have been churning out for decades.
 The food is fine and the portions are reasonable, although the price is slightly steep.
 Maybe I'm spoiled, but whenever I end up in joints like this, I always think back to the three diners on Dupont, around Bathurst, circa 1979, that all served a breakfast special for 99 cents. What did you get? Two eggs, choice of meat, home fries, choice of toast and coffee. By my calculation, that would be about $3,50 in today's money...good luck finding that price, though.
 Yup, to quote Jethro Tull, I am \"living in the past\"."}
{"text":"Basic diner spot and menu. Nice wait staff but the venue has zero ambiance. You're basically sitting in a large store front with tables and chairs. Food is not bad, and I guess this is a good go-to spot for breakfast emergencies. Not one of my favs though."}
{"text":"I don't know what experience everyone else has had but this is the very first time that I've tried eggsmart & it was the worst experience I've had at a breakfast joint. Despite the service being alright, the food was bland and horrible. I ordered the strip loin steak with poached eggs. The steak wasn't even a strip loin steak and it was bland and the sear on the steak was horrible. The poached eggs were under-seasoned as well. The majority of the experience is based on the food and the service and it was not at all pleasurable."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot, i love their omelette. I am very picky with the smell of egg in food and egg smart did a good job to satisfy me. I had Mediterranean omelette and it was great. I def recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Recently discovered thanks to Uber Eats, was nicely surprised with quality of food and size of portions.

The place looks like a regular diner but friendly and organized staff makes the difference.

I had a freshly squeezed orange juice that was delicious and tasty.

I ordered eggs benedict with salmon and home made fries that are actually delicious because they are not fried but baked which makes them earthier.

The eggs on an English muffin with fresh salmon were equal delicious and well done.

Also they came with some fruits on the side which makes it always nice and refreshing.

I have yet to try their house coffee but hey it's Saturday morning, guess where I am going for breakfast? :)

Recommended if you are looking for some good unpretentious place for breakfast in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I ordered eggs Benedict with a side of sausages girlfriend got steak and eggs. My eggs Benedict were ok, very runny which I like but they forgot the sausages and the hollandaise sauce was a weird burnt colour but tasted decent.  My girlfriend ordered the steak medium rare, it came medium well but still said it was flavorful. We both ordered our home fries well done because we find them under cooked if we don't.  They still arrived under done and soaked in grease."}
{"text":"Steps from the Sherbourne subway station and directly across from a Tim Hortons, this quick-stop breakfast place will cost you twice as much as Tim Hortons but give you as much in return.

I've been here a few times and I recommend it.  But, make sure that your expectations are aligned before you pass judgement.

You're in for a quick \"breakfast special\" meal.  The greasy spoon without the grease, this place does a great job of cooking eggs, bacon and toast.  The coffee is good and the refills are free.  Don't expect anything more than that and you're in the right place.

The service is hit-and-miss, but remember, you're paying under $10 for a meal.  I often get up to find my own condiments, but the service has always been surprisingly fast with coffee refills.  If you have cash in your pocket, checkout will be fast."}
{"text":"Try the new menu items,  I had the Baja Bennie with a side salad it was delicious!  A colorful breakfast, is the best breakfast!"}
{"text":"We come here regularly just becuase there are no surprises and they make a good classic breakfast.  They also have  options like turkey bacon and many vegetable inspired omelettes or scramblers to choose from."}
{"text":"WORST Customer Service

My fiancé just worked a night shift at the Southlake Regional center as a nurse. After the long night she wanted to eat some breakfast, so we both decided to go to eggsmart 2 mins away from the hospital. We walked in and a lady frantically mentioned that we can sit anywhere we want. Since there was only two staff in the whole restaurant, we understood that she had a few tasks at her hand at the time. We then took a sit and she asked me and my fiancé what we would like to drink. Since she worked a night shift and wanted to get some sleep after... she told me that she will just take a small sip out of my coffee. The lady who was servicing us heard this and as soon as she left out table, she started muttering about how we want to share 1 coffee. She eventually brought us the coffee and food we ordered, which was actually great quality. However, when we asked for water for my fiancé, the server brought us SALTY WATER. My fiance almost threw up after drinking it. We wanted to let her know that the water she served us was salty and she started saying that the water was from the town and she has NO CONTROL OVER IT!! Yelling at ME! Like it's MY FAULT. She did not offer to replace the tap water and said \"you should buy our bottled water\". She further said that she USED THE SAME WATER FOR THEIR COFFEE. Baffled by this new information and having to drink their coffee I asked her why she's serving bad water. She then turned to the customer next to us and gave him water from the tap, the customer said the water was NOT salty. If this was true, the only reason why the water would be salty is if someone deliberately put salt in it. Regardless of what is the truth, the fact remains that the way the situation was handled reflects VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Based on the experience, I would not recommend this place. The staff did not consider our safety whether the water serve had something wrong with it from a system's perspective or they deliberately serve salt in our water to make us buy their products. Please exercise your good judgment to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Everything came hot and coffee was replenished constantly. The waitress even offered to move us to a different table since there were kids crying near us. We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot with huge portions! Great spot with very good customer service. Will have to try again when I come visit up from California!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm really sorry to read all the bad reviews that most have had here.  My experience was quite pleasant with my hubby here. 

We made an impulsive decision to give this place a try after seeing low mediocre reviews last year.  Got to the restaurant in time for their early special $4.99 breakfast and it was quite good.  I was warned of the poor service but it turned out better for us.  The lady was friendly and helpful, while definitely not your 5 stars service but as good as our expectations. 

The potatoes were slightly on the dry side and tasted like they had reheated from the microwave?  I gave the review a 3 stars because of the early bird special we got but definitely wouldn't be worth full price :D"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a big breakfast this morning and we were very satisfied with both the service and the food. The chef did a great job on everything he made. We will be back definitely."}
{"text":"Eggsmart isn't the BEST PLACE I've ever been for breakfast but it definitely tops off my list of the franchise chains - hence the 4/5.

I used to avoid Eggsmart after a pretty bad experience a few years ago with the quality of food that used to be on their poor menu. But a friend recommended it a little while back and now it's my go-to place. They've revamped their menu in the last while and it is incredible! My favourite? The Baja Bennie. If you're an Eggs Benny lover, you've got to try this. If you're a vegetarian - YOU MUST TRY THIS. It's got avocado, hollandaise and the best mix of Mexican blends. 

Ask for the fries with the following sauces: Chipotle/BBQ and Mayo or try Mayo/BBQ/Hot Sauce in one. Mmmmmm delicious! 

The customer service was amazing. We had Mary-Ann as our server. She was polite, sweet and so genuine about her opinons about the menu when I asked for some advice. We sat there until 3pm (on a Sunday) and the staff didn't even bother saying anything to us. They started cleaning and we realized it was past closing. She greeted us when we left and asked us to return! 

Great experience."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with my daughter. Was acknowledged but didn't seem the servers were that attentive. I went and grabbed the high chair myself without any other help. That is fine. The server took my order and seemed a while before arriving, food was ok.  Decent portion. Would come for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Went by again today after a long while!

There wasn't much customers so we were seated quick and since we already knew our orders, we did that immediately as well. Goodness we came slightly earlier as an entire group dropped by after we placed our order.

Not sure if this was recent but they had cut down the number of sausages from 4 to 3, just like the standard breakfast meals from other restaurants. Unfortunately, that +1 perk of Eggsmart is gone! Though I may not necessarily finish the 4th sausage every time I go, it's still sad to see that they took it out.

But I'd still go here for the convenience and because I don't mind the 4th sausage being gone. The service here is good and I always see people frequenting here whenever I come :) !"}
{"text":"Breakfast early morning.. It was dead and I was the I only one. Didn't think it would be so quiet! She greeted me with the most neutral look, not what I wanted to see early in the day. Ordered the early bird special ($4.99) - it's the classic breakfast. Took the first bite and something tasted off. I'm not saying it was not fresh, the taste was just not there. It could possibly be my taste buds, but I highly doubt that after finishing the plate. The taste persisted and the worst part is I don't know how to describe it lol just didn't taste like the usual. Maybe I'll come again just to see if its the same.. But for now 3 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say about Eggsmart? It's a place to get breakfast, so nothing fancy. However, this is when the deciding factor is based on customer service. To easily put it, simply awesome. My server came with menus the moment we sat down and greeted us. She was well mannered and soft spoken, yet still confident. No complaints in the food department, so an easy 5 stars.

*Update* Apr 13, 2014
Waited for my food for 15 minutes. My server (Maria) came up to me and asked, \"honey, what was your order again? The guys (cooks) messed it up\". I was not impressed.. I overheard her saying to the cooks that she forgot.. Didn't even have the balls to admit it. After the long wait, my food came but was not the right order.. Not impressed today. If you are being served by Maria, make sure you ask her where the heck your food is or did she FORGET?"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with eggsmart. My number 1 issue is homefries thou if I can avoid them with regular fries I do.


So today I took advantage of Wednesday special and had an omelette. The meat lover to be exact. And well it wasn't bad but there wasn't Much favour I got more flavour from packages of jams and peanut butter but it was meh I would give it 2/5 1 is for completely horrible and taste bad. This didn't taste bad but lack taste

Service was decent. I would give an extra .5 for service but I leave my rating at 2 based on the food.

2/5 for food

3.5/Service

4/5 environment

But despite other factors are good, I would stick to 2 for the food"}
{"text":"I think the food here is decent, nothing special. We had a really awesome waitress. One thing though was when our food arrived, we didn't even have utensils. So I ended up taking utensils from an empty table. The bill was given to us while we were still eating because they were getting ready to clean up and close."}
{"text":"The location of this egg smart is very hard to find. A side from that the food was better then most breakfast places. Had a good variaty of breakfast selection. The service was friendly and the food came pretty quick. Overall it was a good experience and would refer anyone who wants a good breakfast to go here."}
{"text":"It was a filling breakfast,  I had ,3 eggs over easy with sausage. Eggs were cooked well, the only thing I don't like about eggsmart is their home fries. 

Was fairly busy but it was a holiday,(Family day) the staff still was on top of things, they were quick and friendly, price was alright but again its nothing special. It's your fast food chain of breakfast more or less.

I probably will still eat there again but there is other places I prefer."}
{"text":"Surprisingly varied menu (including lots more than eggs!)  I had poached eggs and toast and it came with a huge bowl of fresh fruit.  The menu had non-egg options including oatmeal and avocado toast.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"A higher end truck stop feel. 

The \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice is probably 10% pure. It was so sour that I had to drink it like I take Buckley's."}
{"text":"We occasionally come here for breakfast. This past weekend we were excited to see that they've added quite a few items to their menu, including many with avocado. 

I love avocado and ordered the Create-your-own Super Scrambler. I asked for avocado, smoked salmon, provolone cheese and southwest sauce. When my dish arrived I immediately noticed that there is nothing \"super\" about this dish. It came in a small bowl, the size you would get with kid's meal. The southwest sauce was served on the side and was a little cold. I believe it was just salad dressing. The avocado had a strange texture to it. It was VERY bland. These were not fresh avocado slices. It seems as though they were preserved with something which took away any avocado flavour and altered it's texture.

My son ordered the new Eggsmart Poutine. This came with 3 eggs, chopped bacon, cheddar cheese and hollandaise sauce. The first thing he noticed with his first bite was how chewy the bacon was. It was as chewy as beef jerky. This was not real bacon. Bacon is supposed to be salty. This \"'meat\" was lacking any flavour. Also, nowhere on the menu did it say that this dish had onions in it. There were mounds of caramelized onions, which my son had to pick out because he does not like onions.

Service was good and attentive. I would not recommend the new specialty dishes and just stick with the Classic breakfast."}
{"text":"Where did Tucker's go?

Dropped into this inferior replacement. Bland, boring and tired.  With below average service.  Won't be seeing me here again."}
{"text":"Service is really good here - friendly and quick! The inside is a bit old and worn but still fairly clean. I had the classic breakfast and it was alright, not bad but not spectacular either. My bf had the omelet and it had a lot of stuff inside. The home fries were a bit dry."}
{"text":"Breakfast.  What can you say, so close to  the more innovative Cora's.  Typical offering and nothing special on service."}
{"text":"I would go across the street to Cora's first.    Was very disappointing again.   

One main blond older server takes all the customers till her section is full which results in poor service.  Other parts of the restaurant were well serviced and seemed attentive.  I've noticed this a few times how she grabs customers from door and fills her section while the balance of place is so slow.   

Anyway, drab food, not great atmosphere and the poor service won't being me back again."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many times since they opened and am impressed by what they have done with the location (it was a run-down, infested looking Coffee Time store previously which attracted the wrong crowd). It now is bright, clean and service with a smile. 

I think the price was right but my meal wasn't really hot at all and that's probably why I wouldn't come here regularly but I'd be willing to give them another shot when I want a quick sit down breakfast."}
{"text":"Very fast sit down and food service.  Not overly friendly but efficient.  Ordered eggs and Turkey bacon,fries,toast.   Was good but not spectacular.  Gave me rye toast when I ordered white.  Have me home fries when I ordered fries.

Kid friendly. Got stickers.

I would come back."}
{"text":"Mediocre breakfast place. Has a decent amount variety on the menu and average prices. I got the chocolate chip waffle with bacon on the side. It was pretty good, the bacon was a bit overdone. Overall would come here again for a quick cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"I had their early bird breakfast special. 3 eggs, home fries, and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham with toast.  

To be honest the only let down is the rye bread.  The bread is tasty but the size of the slices is small compared to the selection of white or brown toast.  

The coffee was decent and the staff are good at topping up your cup."}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm not big on breakfast joints because I'd rather have a nice breakfast at home and something about paying $15 for eggs and bacon doesn't appeal to me.  However I had a Groupon for it so I was down with that.

Likes:
-they have freshly squeezed orange juice.
-Montreal smoked meat eggs Benny (rare to see) and a very big portion.
- very friendly servers. 
- clean

Dislikes:
-somewhat limited parking at it's in the same complex as a gas station and car wash.

Overall, a very solid chain breakfast joint and it is cheaper than Cora's and less greasy than Sunset grill.  Will visit again when I'm too lazy to make breakfast."}
{"text":"On May 11th I went to your establishment for brunch and was greeted by John. John was very polite and nice while placing my order. I do not eat pork and ordered a southwest without bacon but with salmon. 

Steven, the manager, then came to take over and was a terrible communicator. He did not listen, cut me off several times, and spoke to me in a patronizing tone.  I asked to see the menu to confirm a build an omelet option. However, he was reluctant to show me the menu. Eventually he did. Although I was not happy with the order he proposed. It did not contain what I asked for 5 minutes prior. I asked if I could have a waiter that could communicate better. He, Steven, grabbed my water and orange juice abruptly. He told me that I could leave. I was frightened and taken off guard. I've never, ever been treated this way in my entire life."}
{"text":"Bad experience! 2 stars because the food wasn't horrible, it was just okay. 

The waitress was taking our orders and walked away mid-sentence to go talk to another waitress. After she did take our orders, she gave our food to another table by accident. The other guests didn't realize and started eating our food, when we saw and said something to the waitress, she tried to give us the already eaten plates of food! We actually had to ask her to give us another plate. 

After the long wait for our food, it was nothing special, just OK. 

She was also cleaning tables behind us and sprayed my back with a vinegar cleaning spray and my shirt smelled so bad afterwards. 

When we tried to get the bill and a take out box, we asked twice while seated. We saw her standing around not doing anything for a while, and so I got up and asked her again. She said okay. More standing around and then I got up another time to ask her, she said okay and then asked me what table it was for. 30 minutes after we had initially asked, she finally brought the bill - but not the take out box. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring it. 

The total was $65 for 2 adults and 2 small children.....not worth it at all. Ridiculous experience! Won't be coming back....the worst part about this is that it wasn't even busy. At most, the place was half full."}
{"text":"This is the average breakfast place, I believe it is part of a chain. They offer various breakfast options ranging from pancakes, to wafflea to platters. This location is quite small and cozy. Our waitress was very friendly, as were the other staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for breakfast and was pretty impressed by all the selections on the menu. I got fresh squeezed OJ and a Belgian waffle with whipped cream. Being from the US, we were so stoked to here our waiter say 'eh?' We will definitely be going back next time we head out to Canada."}
{"text":"I used takeout. Food was ready in 6 minutes. Ready when I walked in. Food was good, cooked well, fresh, and friendly service. I'd say a little pricey, but if I was sitting in to eat, the coffee refill would make it worth it. It's with a try and tons of parking."}
{"text":"I've been to this Eggsmart location a couple of times, plus another Eggsmart location once. In general I like these restaurants because they serve only breakfast items and I love breakfast!  The restaurant can be busy at times, but the wait staff is always helpful and nice.  The food is served quickly, is good, and is inexpensive. 

The only downside is that they're only open till 3pm."}
{"text":"I've been to the O'Connor location of Eggsmart once, but have been to other locations as well. They're a great chain of restaurants that serve good food for not a lot of money. They serve only breakfast type items, but that's okay with me!  Service is a little weird. I don't think the waiters have specific tables, but it seems to work for them. 

The only downside to Eggsmart is that they're only open till 3pm, so you can't go there for dinner."}
{"text":"Tables were not cleaned after other customers left. People, including myself were left standing waiting for a table for over 5 minutes. Our presence was never acknowledged so we left. We can spend our money elsewhere....thank you very much!"}
{"text":"At this point in time, this location is relatively new and in my honest opinion, it probably won't have the chance to become \"old\". 

Unfortunately, it is a little bias that since a friend and I were in a rush, the service would seem slower than if we were running on schedule. However, I did manage to keep track of an approximation of time because the service felt pretty outrageous. When we sat down with menus in hand and drink orders in place, it took about ~10-15 minutes to ASK someone to take our brunch order. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict that I was really looking forward too because I didn't want a meat heavy meal. 

~20 minutes from ordering, my friend's order of bacon & eggs came; which in reality should take only a few minutes to cook on their [hopefully] professional kitchen grade grill top. When my friend was halfway finished his meal (and he is a slow-moderate skinny eater), I still haven't received my meal. Becoming weary and famished, I tried flagging one of the very few waiters working that Saturday early/mid afternoon (which is not an unpopular time for the type of food they are serving). I look around me and some people who came after us were served, people who sat before us were annoyed at either not getting their meal either or waiting 10+ minutes to pay. Prioritizing was clearly not in order at this restaurant and I could clearly see the waiters and supervisors/managers scrambling to multitask orders but not their eggs (horribly corny pun intended). 

A different waiter than the one who originally served us since we outlasted her shift, looked at me in the eye and came over to ask me how we were doing. I told her I did not receive my meal, and that's when she finally told me they ran out of smoked salmon and were in the process of purchasing and transporting it to their restaurant, but the truck was stuck in Yonge weekend traffic. Had they told me this as soon as they found out, I would have gladly ordered something else - which is what I did after waiting almost 30 minutes for a meal that would probably never come. Instead of the smoked salmon, I got the ham - when it arrived my friend was done his meal and irritated since I too also eat slow. 

My over-easy eggs were severely under cooked and runny, that lacked any taste so I slathered it with fist fulls of ground pepper and ketchup. The ham tasted like pre-sliced processed packaged ham from a grocery store and was pretty cold compared to the rest of my meal. Hollandaise sauce had the rich texture and feel but didn't taste like anything at all really.

I did not walk into this place with high expectations since it is not known for their gourmet flavours and unique menu. However, in having a simple and classic breakfast/brunch menu, orders should be flying out of the kitchen in perfect sequence and properly cooked. It's unfortunate for the employees who work there. I could see that they have the best intentions and are trying their best to please customers, but I believe its the lack of solid management that caused everyone to scramble with service, cooking, and ultimately poor customer experiences."}
{"text":"When my sister and I arrived the place was PACKED! We noticed a few empty tables thinking that the people waiting will get to their tables so we and a few others can wait indoors. Well, unfortunately, that wasn't the case. 

A couple had come out saying they were told the wait was going to be 5-10 minutes, but they said they waited for half an hour. They said it's not worth the wait. My sister and I decided to go next door to Starbucks and grab a warm latte and head somewhere else. 

Whoever approved the designs for this location is lucky to have a design job. What kind of restaurant doesn't have a waiting area for their customers? Oh wait, this place does... it's called outside in the cold during winter season or tanning on hot temperatures. Brilliant!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  The restaurant is under new management and they offered a groupon for this.  Went during a Sunday brunch and ordered the $7.99 three eggs any way you like and 2 bacon and 2 sausages.  The bacon was long, the right thickness, salty and tasty as bacon should be.  The breakfast sausages were juicy, a nice size and cooked just right.  I had the eggs poached, however, the yolk wasn't creamy as it was a bit overcooked and one of my eggs didn't even have a yolk.  This is really questionable as to what kind of eggs they use.  The fries were very good, seems like they are cut straight from real potatoes, rather than pre-cut and frozen.  The only iffy thing I could say about this place is that what exactly happened to one of my eggs that the yolk went missing?  Actually, they also have freshly squeezed orange juice for $3.99, not sure if this is worth it.  

Anyway, it seems like they are adding burgers to their menu.  I wouldn't mind trying this place again for lunch."}
{"text":"nice friendly service, food comes pretty quick, freshly squeezed orange juice! the fries are coated and so good! good prices for breakfast. the pancake is huge! all the condiments are ready and on the table!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in my Yelp tip on this page (on their very Montreal smoked meat sandwich), everything was superb. Great, fast service service with a smile and a very clean place."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. I ordered a vegetarian omelette with extra fruit instead of potatoes. I get eggs bacon and potatoes and NO FRUIT. I'm a vegetarian and the girl on the phone tried insisting there was no bacon in my meal. Disgusting customer service very rude rushed me off the phone while taking my order that's probably why nothing I asked for was right. I ended up ordering the same breakfast at the woodbine location and they were great it's less then ten minutes apart don't waste your time at this place go to their other location at 7333 woodbine Ave."}
{"text":"Ok.   Everyone who does not live in Whitby shores needs to find their own place for breakfast or lunch.   Yes the ingredients are farm fresh now every time I come and the food and service is excellent.  Cam in the kitchen is a very good chef and the prices are very good.  Please though go find some other eggsmart so I do not have to wait for a table or for take out every time I am here....or this location needs to start taking reservations and creating a section for regulars..."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I was surprised by a more inviting environment than I'd expected. The restaurant appears relatively new though the flat panel TV's were not all on and appeared to need cleaning. My server while pleasant seemed rather nervous and lacked the skill to be even a mediocre server. The biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered the \"Big Breakfast\" with eggs over medium. The eggs came out over easy were sent back and returned beyond over hard. More concerning was that the server took my entire plate and the eggs which were originally served were put back on the grill in violation of health regulations. The food didn't taste special and frankly I'd rather my nine year old nephew make my breakfast next time. I recommend you stay home or travel to another part of the city if you must go out for breakfast in this neighborhood lacking in breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Really good and cheap food, great service too. Went for my birthday and they gave me free little pancakes! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant peach of a place! I've come to Toronto multiple times and never knew about this place, I'm now making this a regular place to visit. Service was great, food came crazy fast and was quite good! 
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Dirty nasty place broke two teeth after biting into a staple in my salad did not have pain or issue immediately but did get food poisoning. A month later I had to have emergency dental work. I contacted the restaurant on a Monday I wait till Wednesday afternoon and call to speak to the owner. He says to me on the phone he was aware of the staple last month but I never said anything about a problem then so how come my teeth crack more to the point where I can't eat. He laughed at me and said try and prove that I knew about the staple, as I'm recording him on my phone. Not happy at all whatsoever. He kept asked me what do I want at so I said how about $1,000 to pay my dental bills he laughed and hung up on me. It's like the time three years ago when I first went into this restaurant and I slipped and fell in the bathroom and had black water all over my clothes. When I told the staff they laughed at me. I didn't really think much of it then but I guess that's what kind of clown shows are run in there. If you look at other reviews another web pages many many many many many people have gotten sick here indicated its dirty or had a horrible time. One of the three times I went was with friends and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich three times. They finished we had somewhere else to be so I ended up having to eat McDonald's on the way to our event. Go across the street and eat at hotel Isabella or dig through the garbage can next to the building and get a better fresher cleaner breakfast"}
{"text":"Food is average, but orange juice is the best. Also, service is excellent. Will become a regular customer."}
{"text":"I went here couple times and i had no complaint.  This place us renovated unlike Wexford Restaurant  (overpriced and grungy).  

this place is great to come with your family, friends and by yourself.  Very cozy, food is not too greadyand price of the menu is reasonable.  Staff is very friendly.

I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This location is way better and cleaner than a previous eggsmart I had visited downtown. We were greeted and seated right away, waiter was friendly, food and bill were prompt as well. 

Food tasted good. I got the eggwhite scrambler and my boyfriend got the classic breakfast which was also good. I felt like half of my eggs were mushrooms, so that would be the only critique I would give it. We also got the freshly squeezed orange juice which was yummy. Upon leaving we were told to have a nice day by not only our waiter but other staff as well which I thought was very nice. 

Overall all went and tasted well and I would come back again to this location."}
{"text":"The Positives:
-Our waitress was very nice and friendly. Our brunch came within 5 minutes of ordering which is always good, especially when you're starving. 

The Negatives:
-Was immediately turned off by the amount of flies in the restaurant, especially on the walls and in the kitchen area (ew).
-Our water looked disgusting! It wasn't clear, it was pretty cloudy and had little white things floating in it. Needless to say I didn't dare touch it. I ordered a juice instead and didn't bother pouring it into the cups provided because of all the flies that were flying in the kitchen area.

The food:
-I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omelette with home fries and toast. My home fries was a bit on the cool side and didn't taste fresh. My omelette was average. My mom definitely makes wayyy better omelettes. 

Overall I was expecting this Eggsmart to be better well kept considering it's at the heart of downtown Toronto. I'll visit Eggsmart again (only if there's nothing better around) but definitely not this location."}
{"text":"This is a fresh approach to feeding the working man. It's located in the Esso Truck Stop on Barlowe Trail, and replaces a tired old place that has been open with no new ideas, and a sadly neglected interior. It is now bright and clean which makes you feel better about coming in.
I am usually in this area on Thursdays and try to eat lunch there. I have gone back on the weekend with friends from out of town, and We all got a good meal, attractively delivered. Sunday mornings they could use one more waitress to speed up service, but the two that were working were busting their buns to cover the tables. 
On my last visit, on the Sunday morning, I had the Steak & Eggs, which were prepared well, and although the steak was ordered medium rare, it was delivered as a medium. Pretty close, and not worth complaining about.
The staff were friendly and earned their tip."}
{"text":"This is a bustling place on a Saturday morning.  We were greeted and seated by cheerful and friendly wait staff. Our drink orders were taken immediately and our food order followed shortly afterward.  The food was geneourous in portion and very good.  We had the Eggs Benedict, kids pancakes and eggs and a fruit waffle.  Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious."}
{"text":"Much smaller serving sizes compared to other EggSmart locations.

The wait time here is brutal! It took at least half an hour for the food to arrive!

This place gets really busy, so I suggest just going to Honey B Hives for your breakfast, and skip this place when necessary.

Their food is overpriced for the amount and the service you get.

Review 69 of 100"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning at 8:45. Was impressed by how big the place is, there's lots of seating and only a couple of tables were occupied. We tried their breakfast special, and as always, servings are huge and filling. I tried their bagel with cream cheese, and the portion is huge as well.

The service is pretty quick. Servers ensured our drinks are refilled, and came to check up on us a couple times.

I will be coming back to this Eggsmart for sure. I find it better than other Eggsmart locations."}
{"text":"Came here for the early bird special, $5.99. I love their eggs, ofcourse. The bacon is always cooked perfectly. Be  Aware that this place does get busy!!! So don't expect a quiet environment for breakfast. Oh and I love their coffee (free refills )

The potatoes are bland unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have never had to walk out of a restaurant in my life and of all places a breakfast spot.  The place was half full and they took over an hour to serve eggs.  They couldn't even keep our coffees going.  They had 3 servers, one cashier and many people making food.  When the eggs came both our orders were wrong.  When we told them they were wrong they just took them back and put us back in the queue. They simply said \"oh ok\"...No apology...nothing..... at the 1hr 15 min mark we got up and left.  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Made my first visit there back in August 2010. Wasn't happy with having the air conditioning on while I was drying off. The French Toast was delicious & my waiter was very attentive & courteous."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for breakfast . I have been looking for one for a long while and came to the conclusion this is the best after several disappointing experiences in the Annex and downtown core."}
{"text":"I definitely like the customer service when I first started, they were attentive sadly did not refill any of our glasses.
They do seem to burn our toast like the other reviews had said. While in the middle of our meal the waiter came over and gave us our bill already. It wasn't even 2! They don't close until 3. So we took our time and didn't pay yet because he told us to take our time. We were talking and catching up since we had not seen each other in a long time. After awhile the waiter came over again and said \"Will you be needing the machine today?\". Thank you for interrupting us again to rush us to pay. So we awkwardly paid. But I really did not appreciate him coming over to ask about the bill twice. It was not busy so I did not understand the need to rush the payment. The waiter never came over to ask to refill water but to ask us to pay the bill? I find that this location really lacks in service, it really can vary some days you will get a really good waiter and some days we have gotten a waiter who seemed hung over and plain awful. Only come here if you have to. There are a lot of other great places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Split an omelet platter with a friend. The veggie omelet, fries, etc were fairly decent. The service was not the best given the server's attitude but whatever."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch place. Quality of food is amazing and service is excellent at this particular location. Would highly recommend the homemade chicken noodle soup and eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I first started going to this Eggsmart while our kitchen was being renovated in 2009. I used to pass by on my way to work, and I think it had just recently opened, so I gave it a try. I continued going for a few years, maybe a dozen times, often being the first person there when it opened at 7am, so the service was fast and friendly. After moving away from the area, I returned this past week for the first time in many years, and found that much had changed. The decor was completely different; it used to be a plain open dining area with a few food pictures on the walls; now it has a divider down the center, with nicer furniture throughout, and somewhat resembles the Cora's in Scarborough. The service was okay, except that my scrambled eggs arrived sunny-side up instead.

The menu is generally standard breakfast fare: egg breakfasts, omelettes and scramblers, various types of eggs benedict, waffles and French toast, along with some lunch plates and salads. There are a few twists, such as Montreal smoked meat hash and red velvet pancakes, and the Eggsmart poutine that I ordered. It was home fries mixed with eggs and bacon and cheese, and covered with hollandaise sauce. I enjoyed it, and it was definitely filling, and their coffee was pretty good too. Total bill came to $16, so about the same as many other breakfast places.

Perhaps it was all the changes, and the fact that it was much busier than I was used to, but overall my visit seemed less memorable than previously. Everything was okay, but no better than an average breakfast out for an average price. I'm sure I would return if I was still in the area, but don't think I would travel far just to go there."}
{"text":"I should not even give them 1 star. My Daughter and I gave this place a try on Christmas eve day. Well they had no coffee, tea so no big deal, Orange juice it is. Daughter and I ordered and low and behold......WHAT!?!?! Can't make waffles? Well we decided to leave. Hopefully they are better then this."}
{"text":"Will most definitely come back here. We had a problem with another Eggsmart earlier that day and explained that to the waiter. Well he made us forget all about the other experience. They are awesome here,always topping up coffee and making sure everything is king well."}
{"text":"I seem to always have a bad experience ordering delivery from here. Their food quality is extremely poor, and they skim on portion size. Not to mention have they ever once listened to special instructions given when asked. 

My boyfriend and I have ordered from here every morning for the past 4-5 days, hoping that after we left feedback to the restaurant and UberEats, that something would change. Nope. 

We ordered the BananaBerry Pancakes and the Big Breakfast (with a extra side of sausage). They give barely any syrup, and when I asked for more, they gave me less than normal. They also only gave me the normal banana pancake once, and the rest of the time sent normal pancakes... My boyfriend asked that there be no vegetable decorations on his food, and they put lettuce and tomato. He also asked that they substitute his pancakes for ham, and no toast -- they gave him double toast. 

This place is honestly a clown fiesta if you get delivery. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast - good portions - fair price.  Friendly service - treated like family."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but not good enough to warrant the full 3rd.

Tried this place twice for lunch. First time went with the Cubano sandwich with home fries and it was decent. Didn't knock my socks off but was good enough for $8.99 that I decided to return again for another lunch a while later. This time I went with the banquet burger (aka burger with cheese and bacon) with french fries. 

That is one crappy hamburger. Poor tasting beef and over cooked french fries... And perhaps my fault for not ordering without onions but they are actually fried onions and way too many of them which just killed any last chance of enjoyment I would have had without, but the reality is that even without onions this meal was a dealbreaker from me returning, unless perhaps for some straight up breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with the lovely Anastasiya one sunday, post being mad hungover (it was sunday, don't judge!)

This place is located in the plaza with food basics and stuff around yonge and royal orchard. I've seen it millions of times, but I've never actually been.

Anywas, I had the grilled cheese combo with fries. It was pretty blah in my opinion. Wasn't too much of a fan.

Ana had the big breakfast, and I tried her pancakes..also kinda blah.

It was really olden style inside..but not like in a cute-sy way, just more like in an outdated kinda way.

It was edible, so theres a star. I doubt I'll be back though."}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty tasty breakfast! 
Good food, even better prices 
Was absolutely packed on New Year's Day but they moved fast and seated us quickly."}
{"text":"As a big foodie and someone who loves to try new things, I seldom find a place that I would consider my \"go to\" option. However, I came across an EGGSMART a year ago that changed my perception on dining experiences entirely. If you're looking for copiousness in food (large portions), quality, budget friendly, and excellent customer service (aka the whole 9 yards) I would highly recommend the Eggsmart's located on 1923 Eglinton Avenue, 2904 Shepard Avenue, and 8051 Yonge street. 

I've been a frequent diner in all 3 locations since I first discovered this place. These 3 locations are run by the same family who know good food, and amazing customer service. The family knows good food and how to treat their customers right.. they are attentive, caring, and also quite the entertainment. Where there's family passion, there's an extra special atmosphere.. As a regular customer, I have never turned back! 

As a meal, I often opt for the steak and eggs with caramelized onions, melted cheddar cheese, and hollandaise sauce on the home fries.. the steak is topped with provolone and sautéed mushrooms and onions ... All I can say is getting a New York Striploin at this price that not only offers quality, but leaves you wanting more--- is a complete steal! Have it with a freshly squeezed orange juice and something sweet for dessert (my favourite the skyscraper) and you have yourself a party! :p 

If I haven't said it already... please try this place (in the locations I specified only) to get the whole dining experience that will leave you wanting to go back there again! 

Thank you to the owners of these Eggsmart locations.. will see you same time as always! 

:D

{"text":"I'm actually shocked why this place has 4 stars. It's a basic chain breakfast spot. I think IHOP or Denny's has better service and that's already saying a lot. Took a long time to get our server to take our order then another server was about to bring us menus to take our order again, unorganized.  I saw one server grab two cups from a vacated table, not picking up the other silverware or plates, and went back to the kitchen and brought two cups of coffee to another table. (Idk what happened there) we also didn't get our cutlery when our food came. The cook actually took our food out to us since the servers were not responding to the bell/food ready alerts.  The table next to us left after not getting any service or anyone taking their order.  The other table next to us didn't get their drinks, they got their food first.  Looks like they're under staff but they shouldn't be this bad. It's shocking they have 4 stars.  I wouldn't go back. Food was mediocre, not good enough for me to come back. The cook was actually the best, trying to run the show and get a handle on things."}
{"text":"This place has gotten new owners alot of times and each time people dont know how to properly serve someone. 

I've sent many emails complaining about this place to their head office. so far i never got a response back even leaving my number in the email.

The food is not cook 100%, you have the women cutting up potatoes and chatting with one another in front of other customers. i thought eggsmart was a breakfast place not a greasy spoon diner in the middle of now where.

As well you ask nicely for certain things to be done a certain way. they completely ignore you and risk your health. i don't want to get food poisoning do you?

My friends and i ordered a huge big breakfast and we asked them nicely to not give us any homefries at all as we rather be eating everything else. 

She must've gotten insulted cause every single plate had far too much home fries in it. 

I don't bother with eggsmart anymore and go else where to a better place the listens to the customers."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed breakfast if lest to my own vices I would eat breakfast food all three times of day! 
Egg Smart has a great selection of breakfast food, although I think that it is hard to get breakfast wrong. I have been to several Egg Smart location and I have noticed they are pretty consistent in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is not great. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table on a Sunday morning (that part is fine, happens all the time everywhere) but there does not appear to be a dedicated host/hostess, one of the waiters eventually pointed us to a table that hadn't been completely cleared. We tried the eggs benedict with sweet potato fries and the eggsmart poutine. Both were fine -- not the best, not the worst. No one ever came by to refill our coffees. It was very busy and like a lot of the other reviews note, they seem understaffed. The poor waitstaff seemed to be running around a lot. We saw our server only twice -- when she took our order and when she gave us our bill. If they added just one more server I think that would make a big difference during the breakfast/brunch rush on weekends."}
{"text":"Food was good and plentiful. Service was a tad bit slow. If they ask if you want cheddar and onions on your breakfast potatoes..,SAY NO!!!  It's the most expensive cheese and onions you'll ever buy!"}
{"text":"Still great food and service. They added some new items and a new menu style. My only suggestion would be to fry the home fries for a little longer. I like them a bit crispier."}
{"text":"Staying at the Sheraton Parkway in Markham, Eggsmart is a 7 minute walk for the hotel. They have a $4.99 breakfast special until 10am. The food was great and the service excellent. It was not busy so everything was fresh fast and delicious. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for breakfast whenever I'm not in a rush for work. You can't beat an early bird special for $5.99 with 3 eggs, 4 slices of toast, ham or sausage and some fruits to complete this wholesome breakfast. The quality of food is average but I come here for the service and bottomless coffee, which is always pleasant to start off my day. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning since we had some overnight guests. Ordered 4 different things (Eggsmart Classic Breakfast with Bacon, Strawberry & Banana Pancakes, French Toast, and an Open Faced Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese) and we were all impressed with the portions and quality of our order!

The server was very friendly, efficient and attentive. The restaurant was clean, and well-lit. Will not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Usually come here early morning for the breakfast but decided to come here today for the lunch. They have burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and even burritos. I got the Twisted Chicken Joe which is  basically a grilled chicken sandwich with onions, cheese, and Chipoltle sauce. It came with either French fries or home fries. My bud got the simple burger with cheese, he liked it. Service was pretty quick, got our food in maybe 15 minutes? Orange juice was sweet and ice cold, loved it."}
{"text":"Last week, I was eating at the Warden and Eglinton location, and the manager/owner told me that they had just taken over this location and told me to come by one day. This location is much closer to where I work so I thought I'd drop  by just for lunch hoping that the service would be on par with the other location. And to my surprise, it was on par. Staff had a positive and consistent attitude, fast service and good food. I'll probably swing by every once in awhile when I'm craving breakfast for lunch. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The service staff here do not seem like they are awake, or they really hate their job. Eating here, you feel very rushed and your business doesn't seem welcomed at all. The food was nothing spectacular, nothing my mom can't do at home. With the quality of food amd service, I would recommend you just eat at home and save a few bucks."}
{"text":"I have visit this restaurant many times , one time it was a very warm day , the steak taste was not very fresh , and the server changed a new one me! the servers & food here, are always fresh and best ! I highly recommend here !"}
{"text":"So...i had to write a review after reading some of the reviews.. I had very low expectations...
So.. We walked in... 8am on a Saturday...There was only one car and one person in there already.. Which concerned me even more..
Was greeted immediately...
Sat at a table offered coffee right away...
I ordered the classic breakfast with well done bacon the eggs omelet style with cheese 
My gf got the French toast
Food came out fast... Everything was great..
My only complaint was that the home fries were a little cold.. Other wise everything was great.. Coffee was good to me. My gf said it was a little week.. But all in all I would come back.. Food was great overall!"}
{"text":"Waitress was great, however, they were out of some foods .... no chicken strips, only regular fries - no \"jersey shore\" .... something new we wanted to try. Food was okay overall."}
{"text":"We tend not to go out as often for breakfast- but given the Easter weekend we elected to go to Eggsmart for Brunch. While it was busy we were greeted promptly and by the looks of things the staff are adept at turning over the tables by being over attentive at times. The food was serviceable; however the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict cannot compare to that in Montreal. The service deniably adds a Star to make this a string 3 to a 4 star. As you can see from the bill, e Percy to pay a dinner price for lunch fare; definitely 10% higher than the average and coffee is not included in the already high price. Notice that we weren't thanked when leaving, a fact that wasn't lost on us."}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service is awful. Great at seating you and taking your order but when it comes to paying for your bill they all disappear. We had to basically beg them to let us pay and it took 30 mins! Terrible."}
{"text":"This is a newer location of the breakfast/brunch chain Eggsmart. It has the same, basic, breakfast foods and nice, big breakfast combos. We started going to this location a few months back when we realized it was open and go every once and awhile. We've always had pretty consistent service and the food as been as good as one expects from this type of place. I usually get their two eggs combo with bacon and toast and I like it because it's basic. Prices are pretty good (although your non-chain greasy spoon will likely have comparable for cheaper). Today I had the spinach and feta cheese omelet and wasn't a fan. Too much feta was rolled up in the omelet and it was all your could taste. Will go with my basic again next time."}
{"text":"I'm feeling smart! I had my usual, eggs, bacon and toast.  The home fries are nice, and they brought one of those racks loaded with the little jam packets, including PB.  Great coffee, excellent service with a smile.  And, of course, free WiFi.

I'm going to have to spend more mornings here!"}
{"text":"These guys are near my office so I go often. I think they doing better at lunches that they are expected  too . How can you go wrong with breakfast ? Here is the recent fish and chips on a Friday. Much better than when they first opened as the fish while not large was crispy. Fries were not overdone or sitting around."}
{"text":"It's a great place to enjoy breakfast or lunch. The lunch specials are pretty good, in terms of value and flavour. We came for breakfast on this visit, the western omelet was exceptionally good; I would advise everyone to try it. They also serve fresh cups of orange juice, I ordered this but did not like it at all; I'm not sure what kind of oranges they used but it didn't taste as fresh as I thought it would.  There were plenty of seats, so you can easily pick where you want to seat. The staff were courteous and friendly, as well as professional. We didn't wait too long for our order and it was served fresh and hot. The view from the restaurant isn't that great, it looks out onto the parking lot and Eglinton Avenue; basically this is not the place you bring someone for the view. It's a good place to bring friends or family when you want to treat them for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Food was just okay for the prices.. The coffee was not very good but the worst thing about this place was the cleanliness. We had 4 people on our table and 2 of them had dirty utensils with dried up food leftovers on the fork, gross! So we told the waitress and she grabbed up two from another table.. they were both dirty too! It's a little appalling that out of 6 utensils only 2 were clean, chances are the kitchen isn't that clean either! Also the waitress was super awkward and she was very overwhelmed by the amount of people in the restaurant that it would take us forever to flag her down. Definitely will not be going again."}
{"text":"Service was not good at all, server seemed bored and uninterested in being here. The food came out really fast (under 5 minutes) but was just ok, my eggs were a little over cooked from what I asked, and my toast was barely buttered at all. However, I wasn't expecting much out of this breakfast experience considering the low prices."}
{"text":"I had the Montreal smoked Eggs Bennie, which was just ok. The hollandaise sauce was nothing to write home about, but the home fries were pretty good. The orange juice is freshly squeezed but costs 4 bucks for a glass."}
{"text":"Came a Saturday morning, wasn't busy.  Tables were clearing out and we were yet to get our order of the classic breakfast and avocado toast.    Seemed chaotic and it was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I am extremely disgusted.

I am going to provide four experiences of coming to Eggsmart. First time, I was seated immediately, and the staff were kind. Even though it took an hour for the food to come, it was okay. After this, it all started going downhill. The second time I went with my parents, we were seated, but it took them 20 minutes to provide me a menu. The woman that was our server always tells to wait, wait wait. Okay. an hour later, we finally were able to make an order, and then we waited for another hour to get our food. We complained to out server, and she starts to give attitude to me. So I decided to let it slide, thinking that this wouldnt happen again. The third was I had the exact same experience, but even worse. Some of the food wasn't cooked, and I get unknown substances in my pancakes. The server was the same, still with the same bad attitude. Today I went to get some takeout, since it was the only place that still has pancakes. It took her 15 minutes to place an order, even when I was the only person in the restaurant. After around 20 minutes, I went back to see if my food was done. I stood there for 10 minutes, and after she points to 3 bags on the table beside me, \"Thats your food\". When I got back to eat, the toast was fully burnt to a crisp, the potatoes have gone bad, and I also had onions in my pancakes??? 

Eggsmart needs to understand that brunt food can cause cancer, and you can't just burn all 4 slices of my bread. I didn't eat a bite out of it, and I ended up throwing away the homefries, since most of it has already turned green, and gone bad.

I hope that eggsmart steps up their game, because this is starting to become the reason why no one goes there anymore."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. We came in for breakfast sat down and 2 tables came in after we did and received menus and cutlery before we did. After waiting not getting a single person to come to us we got up and left the restaurant. I wouldn't return. Bad service."}
{"text":"I like this location. Our server was very nice and we didn't wait long for our orders to arrive. We had a late breakfast/early lunch so this place was a good pick as it wasn't far from where we lived.

Our food was nicely portioned and the overall meal was very tasty. I do like the fact that its very straight forward and we enjoyed our meal in peace as there wasn't a rush of customers when we came in. 

So yes, I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"There's nothing more enjoyable than going out for breakfast.  Whereto? Eggsmarts! 
What used to be Country Style back in the day, Eggsmart is your typical breakfast place that's serving up traditional breakfast/ brunch options.  
Parking is convenient, getting out of the plaza may not be easy. 
Service is great!
Food is a-ok, I have had better. 
I ended up ordering their big Eggsmart breakfast which came with sausage, thinly sliced ham, bacon, eggs, toast and two pancakes. 
The ambiance is anything but fancy, and their prices are somewhat, YES Somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"Hunger makes me desperate.
I mean, that's it really. The ONLY reason I ate anything from this place.
Because this place is where sub-par food reigns and good food is a complete unknown.

I ordered a BLT. 
YES. THEY SCREWED UP A BLT. 
There is very little actual cooking involved here, people.
And yet it was the worst BLT I've ever had.

Bread. Burnt.
Lettuce. Yellow-ish white in colour.
Bacon. Limp.
Tomatoes. Only thing decent.
Mayo. Liberal.

The BLT came with fries or hash browns.
I choose the fries. I really wish I didn't.
I loathe coated fries. Not much left to say after that.

As a parting gift, I now have a stomach ache.

All that for $5.99 plus tax.
What a deal."}
{"text":"Love coming here. I bring my dad for brunch quite often. Every single staff are super friendly and helpful. The food is great and comes quickly."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.  

The Yelp reviews were pretty average but the Trip Advisor ones were better so we decided to give it a shot.  Brunch food is my go-to and am always on the hunt for a good all day breakfast place.

We got to the restaurant about 12:30 on a Friday and there were 4 other sets of diners; I will say it is very nicely decorated and quite welcoming.  The menu is extensive but we came for breakfast food so that's what we ordered; eggs Benny for me and the kid's breakfast (bacon eggs toast) for my 9 y/o.  The meals came out quickly enough - rightly so as there were only 3 other tables at this point, but both meals were lukewarm (not cold though so no biggie).  

The hollandaise sauce was your average run of the mill commercial sauce from a mix - tastes identical to Ben & Florentine or Cora's or Sunset Grill or any other fast service breakfast place. I really expected a bit more for the price ($11). My real complaint though was the home fries, they were pre cooked cubes of potato and then quickly warmed up and \"seasoned\".  They actually weren't seasoned nor were they cooked; out of the entire meal maybe 3 of them were edible - they were still hard on the inside, soft (not crispy) on the outside, and absolutely tasteless.  

I let the waitress know when she came when we were done, she didn't really care that both of our plates were still half full and just took them away.  She did ask if we wanted another order after i said she should mention something to the chef, but it was at the end of the meal and we just wanted to leave.  Maybe if she had checked up on us at some other point in the meal I could have let her know but I barely saw her; I saw more of the other waitress who was actually interacting with her tables. 

Oh and $2.50 for a class of orange juice from a box. Not fresh squeezed. And a third ice.  

Oh well, definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"For our anniversary, I decided to purchase a groupon for Eggsmart which was $18 for a $30 voucher that could only be used mon-fri.

Upon entering the sign told us to \"seat ourselves\" so we did but were immediately approaches by a staff member. I told her we had a groupon and she was more than happy to take it.
She actually had to use her own phone to redeem the barcode which was a little odd but cool nonetheless.

We ordered freshly squeezed orange juice which was $4.49 a cup... Wowza!!! 
I ordered the banana berry pancakes with a side of bacon and my husband ordered a big everything breakfast. 

The food was delicious and filling. Our server was attentive and very polite which is rare when redeeming groupons (from personal experience.)

Our bill all said and done was only $7 and that was because of the expensive orange juice LOL.

I really enjoyed my visit here, there was tons of seating, tv's to watch and good food. The only thing I would change is having more combo options, everything was an additional price unless you got en egg combo. (Bacon, ham, hashbrowns, etc)

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict with Peameal Bacon.  $4 for Orange juice, It's fresh and good a little pricey for the size tho. Peameal Bacon is good but the Eggs Benedict it self wasn't anything special. The yolk was over cooked, the home fries a bit on the tasteless side.  Service was subpar,  never came by and asked how was my food.  I Didn't bother mentioning the yolk was over cooked then. Oh well.. no point coming back."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely pathetic....you really see the staff outright ignoring customers and letting things break down leaving unfortunate patrons watching helplessly if they've already committed to the meal
 From the time I entered it took 40 Mins to get my breakfast. Not going to this place again"}
{"text":"My mom and I have been here a few times in the last few weeks and each time has been great.  The servers are friendly and efficient, the food is always tasty, and the portions are very generous.  When we went on Friday my mom had the fish and chips and I had the steak and eggs, both dishes were delicious.  We will continue to come back as it is close to home and the food never disappoints. 

My 4 star rating is only because our server, totally unintentionally, spilled a few drops of black coffee on my new white canvas sneakers :(    oh well, I managed to get most of it out in the washroom and it was probably a bit my fault to begin with anyways!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep torturing myself and going to an Eggsmart every once in awhile.  Maybe I forget that I don't really like it.  To be fair, the place is clean and the servers were all very nice (really nice) so this review is nothing against them.

I just don't like the food.  I had the eggs (poached) on an english muffin with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce.  My brekkie came doused with sauce...do much so that it made everything else so soggy that after a few bites I lost interest."}
{"text":"Great food, great price.

I had a coffee, and spinach and feta omelet which came with home fries and toast. My waitress was friendly and the service was still fast, while being pretty packed.

Cost with tip 12$"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, organized.
Food is good, not going to blow you away, but enjoyable.
Interior is basic, prices very fair, will return."}
{"text":"Eggsmart is a standard Canadian breakfast restaurant, offering eggs, toast, pancakes, sandwiches and whatnot.  The restaurant is not accessible, as it has a step in the front, and offers gendered bathrooms.  Meal options can be modified for vegetarians, but options are limited to mostly salad and potatoes for the vegans.  

Overall, the food was \"okay\" and the service was bad.  I came with my partner on Pride weekend, which was a Sunday.  I know that Sundays are the busiest days for breakfast places, but if anything, it should be their time to shine since it's the one day a week they know they'll be busy.  And it wasn't \"line up\" busy.  It was \"poorly managed\" busy.  

We sat down, everything seemed fine, but then it was clear it wasn't going to be.  A table that had been seated and served before we entered began getting hungry and wondering where their food was.  I overheard them saying they'd been waiting half an hour.  What really caught me off guard was when the waitress replied \"well shit happens\" in front of the family's young child.  

I was unable to get a coffee refill until my bill came.  I find that unacceptable.  The food took a good half hour to come out, and it was good but not great.  I'm not coming back here again unless somebody drags me."}
{"text":"Breakfast special Monday through Friday was great !
Good price and food !
I ate there daily during my week vacation in Toronto"}
{"text":"This is a typical, chain breakfast/brunch joint. I come here because it's on the way between my place and my parents place on the weekends. Usually get a triple decker with fries and the big breakfast, whatever it's called. The breakfast comes with eggs, pancakes, home fries, toast, sausage, ham and maybe bacon? I don't really remember if there's bacon for some reason..but if there isn't you can ask to sub something, last time i subed my pancakes for french toast and it was fat and delicious!! 

The fries here (normal fries) are AMAZING. Super delicious and perfectly crispy. The 3-decker is pretty decent, not enough mayo for moi - ask for more. 

I don't like that they charge a whooping 1.50 for a side of hollandaise (?) sauce...why people, WHY SO MUCH?!!? 

The decor is Cora-like, nothing fancy, nothing over-powering and tacky - pretty pleasant and clean.

Coffee is good, my double breakfast meal usually comes to about $27-30 bucks, service is fast and I'm happy! I would much rather go to a cheap diner style place, somewhere in the boonies, but this is all I can get down this stretch of yonge street other than 3 Coin Diner...so i'll keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Located in the same parking area as the Petro Canada Gas station. Not really located on Queensway, more so on cawthra.

VERY SMALL LOCATION!

Kitchen staff talked so loudly in an Asian/Middle East language it made it difficult to focus on my own conversation. Chairs were stacked well before closing time, which makes me feel like they don't want us there.

I will not return to this location.

Waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8am on a Sunday and it was completely empty.  No cars in the lot and no one eating inside.

That's a bad sign for a breakfast joint.

But we were warmly greeted by Nabilla who sat us and was also our waitress.

The food is pretty standard breakfast fare.  Nothing too creative or fancy.  Just solid egg dishes, pancakes, etc

The food was tasty and the service was amazing.

In simple terms, if you want simple, straightforward standard breakfast that is delicious with little to no wait - give this place a shot.

If you are looking for a true brunch, fancier setting, or more creative offering - you won't be satisfied."}
{"text":"It's a decent spot to grab a quick breakfast. I have to warn you this place is tiny and quite busy so if you're looking to have a long breakfast while reading a book this would not be the best choice. Another thing i didn't quite like was that the tables are so close to each other that the waitress kept bumping into our table trying to get through. 
The food was alright, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"WHY IS THIS FKING PLACE STILL HERE???
I had fking diarrhea during a very formal meeting after I ate this shit. 
Looking for washroom like an idiot ! Fk you!"}
{"text":"For all of you who are new to Richmond Hill, this corner pretty much used to be farmland.  Until recently, there used to be a diner which looked like it survived through the depression there.  It's kinda funny because it was a raggedly old place that was surrounded by a new plaza (guess the owners just didn't want to give in to selling).

Nowadays, I guess the landowners got a pretty penny and an EggSmart opened up.  Now, I'm a big fan of breakfast, I'll have it any day of the week and at any time of the day.

I usually order poached eggs and ham or sausage (depending on how I feel at the moment).  Their poached eggs weren't that bad, they were quite average really; same goes for the ham.  What I really didn't like is the potatoes.

You know those potatoes that are cut up into little casino dice pieces and are fried after?  Ya... I hate those.  Note to all restaurants, Those potatoes suck.  It's like eating the bottom of the fry container... except your plate is full of them.

The coolest thing about the place in my opinion was their orange juice machine (which takes up a square meter of the front counter).  It almost looks like a robotic version of a candy machine that's sole purpose is to demolish oranges.

Any-who,  I probably won't come back just cause I think there are better places to have breakfast.  And... I really hate casino dice potatoes."}
{"text":"I thought because it was new to the neighborhood i would support them so I took my grandson there for breakfast the Sunday before family day. The menu looked good and i had great anticipation about my meal. Ordered my meal with orange juice, orange juice came warm had to ask for ice the waitress came with 2 cubes only maybe they had a shortage on ice,  While i was sitting there i notice other folks who had come after us were getting served, I'm thinking maybe because i ordered Omelettes, maybe that's why they're taking so long to serve me, after waiting 45 minutes for my breakfast drank all my juice i went to speak to someone in charge about the long wait, she brushed me of telling me its coming soon, i waited 5 more minutes, no meals came so i pack my grandson up and went to wimpy's i was served in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place for breakfasts over the weekend. Nothing better to start the day than some nice eggs, orange juice, coffee and a staff that is super friendly and attentive. I have always had the veggie omelette here with the egg whites. You can go with the house fries or the french fries - both are nice. The place usually gets crowded at about 8.30 am - so you are good going in a bit earlier but the staff will make every attempt to make your wait time less. The washrooms are on the basement and that could be a bit of an inconvenience if you have elders with you. There's plenty of parking space nearby and you won't have a problem. Overall, a good place for a sumptuous breakfast."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday morning and had a hearty breakfast. There is adequate separate parking available and this is one of the reasons why folks love this option. The most painful part, however, is  the wait time. The staff is very nice and treat you well - I guess they are aware that we are frustrated  with the wait. The food here is awesome. They have so many types of omelettes that you will love the variety. Go here for a Sunday brunch and you'll just want to take a nap after it. A place for a brunch!"}
{"text":"Eggsmart is the definition of a no-frills, basic, run of the mill breakfast spot with the nothing special to offer, and just the basics. I stopped into Eggsmart on Sunday morning thanks to being an early riser and not much else in the area really being open that I wanted. The place had a decent number of people in it but we were seated right away. The menu here is pretty standard and offers the usual breakfast platters, omelettes, and pancakes you could want. I ended up ordering a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs, wheat toast, hash browns, and I had a sausage link to go with it. The food was what it needed to be, it tasted like any run of the mill diner and did the trick. The food I ate was all good, just nothing to really discuss or write about. If you live in the Bay/Gerrard area this isn't a bad place to stop for a cheap breakfast, just don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"I love the egg white veggie scrambler. My favorite brekkie here. This time I tried the sausage scrambler and N enjoyed the egg white scrambler. Kaya had the eggs and sausages.. 

Service was OK at this location and it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch. Was pretty busy for a weekend lunch, which was expected. There was limited staff, so there was a bit of a wait. I had the fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries, and the meal for 5.99 was a pretty good deal. You can get a good meal here for 6 bucks which is awesome. If you want a decent inexpensive breakfast, Eggsmart is the place for you. If you want something a bit more fancy for breakfast, there are plenty of spots. This is a great place for a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"The $2 dollar breakfast may be dead, but it doesn't mean you can't get a great early bird special from Eggsmart. Get here before 10am on a weekday, and you get eggs, meat toast and home fries for only $4.99. Not too bad. 
If you come here any other time, I recommend the egg sandwich for a pretty comparable price. It is eggs bread and home fries, so it basically has everything except the meat.

Service is a bit slow because of the limited amount of staff on hand, but overall, will come back again if I don't feel like cooking breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here this morning and despite all the reviews saying I'd wait, and I figured I'd be in for it on a Saturday morning, it was quick and the guy (seemingly this is his place) was very attentive and let us know that he'd seen us and would be there right away.

We got seated and a girl came to take our FOOD order before asking for drinks but we ordered drinks and asked her to give us a sec for food.. We ordered the OJ, which is good, but maybe don't order the 1L serving (we didn't but we thought about it).. It's an acquired taste and I could probably only take a glass at a time.. 

I had the Buregger (or whatever).. it's ACTUALLY called The Aussie in case you are going off the big sign that drew you into the place with the burger and the egg on it that says TRY THE BUREGGER or something so then you can go in and try and order it and then have the same situation.. or you can just order the Aussie -- it was good.. One thing I would like to note is that the burger bun tasted sweet -- like they had just cooked some pancakes or maple bacon and then grilled the bun in whatever was leftover on the grill -- really good, but it took me a sec to figure out what was going on..

The banana and strawberry pancakes were also ordered and they were REALLY heavy with 3 big thick pancakes, with bananas in them, and then banana & strawberry over top.. Just heavy -- I'll stick to the Bergger (or whatever)...

oh, also, lots of coffee refills coming around frequently..

It's close to my place and I'll totally be back.."}
{"text":"We (party of two) waited at the front door behind the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for 10 mins while there were 3 empty tables available (one was not cleared). When the waitress finally seated us we didn't see or hear from her again for 10 minutes when she asked if we'd like anything to drink. When she brought over our coffee and water I told her we were ready to order but she didn't return for another 10 mins. After waiting so long to place my order (20 mins), I had decided to go the safe and quick route, classic breakfast (bacon, eggs, home fries, and toast). And the food took another 15-20 mins to come. Huge disappointment. They're clearly short staffed in the waiter/waitress department, but I don't understand why a simple bacon and eggs from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast foods takes soo long.  Two other tables that were seated before us, still had not received their food when our breakfast came, by the time we were half way done, one of those tables got their omelette the other still waiting for pancakes which arrived when we got the bill (they waited half an hour for an omelette and strawberry and banana pancakes!). 
The food was nothing special. The toast arrived with a heaping amount of butter already on it, the home fries had no taste (not even the taste of potato), bacon and eggs were standard (thank goodness). 
Next time, we're going to Wimpy's, where we're usually in and out of there in 30-35 mins with happy stomachs."}
{"text":"Friendly breakfast and brunch diner. Staff friendly and always eager to see you.

What I love about this chain is the scramblers. Scrambled eggs with 3 additional toppings (veggie, meat or cheese) a wonderful idea! My favourite is spinach, green peppers and avocado (yum!). Everything is fresh and delicious.

One warning: if dining alone avoid this place on Sunday morning. They'll seat groups before serving individuals. 

Price point is very reasonable for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"Pretty standard experience here. If you're looking for a cheap breakfast without anything over and above then this is the place for you. They have an early bird special before 10am if you really want to make things as cheap as possible.

I tried something a little different on this occasion going with one of their scramble bowls. I chose the meat lovers version. Overall it was pretty solid. It was a good portion size and you could actually tell what was in it.

The service was a little lacking here. My friend and I gave our waitress a little bit of a hard time (in good humour). She had a laugh with us and said it was just \"one of those days\" after she had made her second or third mistake. They don't have A/C so maybe it was the heat."}
{"text":"An alright place, went in and waited way to long to get seated. Than the host came and told us they are cleaning a table for us, even though there was a table there already. Than they cleaned it. Made us wait another 2 mins and seated us at the other table, not the one they cleaned. We than sat down and waiting again for a waitress to come and take our order. I got my order, chocolate chip pancakes and sausage. As I was eating, there was onions in my pancakes. Like come on. Clean your shit. I wasn't happy at all. Couldn't eat my food. All I tasted was onions and the sausage tasted expired. Couldn't eat. Also they didn't even have everything on the table, you'd think when you order a coffee, there would be milk and cremè, I had to hunt down for someone. Basically get off my seat. Will not go back there again."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was ok. Ordered 3 eggs sunny side up. They were over cooked a little. Peameal bacon was also overlooked and cut too thin in my option. The server though was super friendly so that made up for the food. It was what was expected."}
{"text":"I drop in here for breakfast once a year while having my car rustproofed nearby. The food has always been good and the service efficient and friendly.

This morning, I had a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich with fries and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The sandwich was good any was only $8.99 with the fries but the juice was $4.49. Really? For a glass of orange juice? It was freshly squeezed but I could have bought a family sized jug for that price."}
{"text":"The reviews for Eggsmart are accurate! A great selection of breakfast and lunch items, many healthy low calories options and salads. My West Coast burger with egg, provolone cheese, spinach, bacon, chicken breast, avocado mayonnaise on a brioche bun was superb and satisfying. Some very fancy looking pancakes with fruit and other toppings as well."}
{"text":"Great food with very questionable service. Two waitresses but only one was competent (the younger Indian lady). The elderly waitress was rude and incapable of working more than two tables at a time. Even going as far as to yelling at the Indian waitress publicly. All in all, not a good time."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first after reading the reviews but was starving and decided to take a shot at it. And its good i did. 
Place was busy. Got a table for 2 right away. Got our menus...ordered coffee and ordered within 5 minutes. Food came out in 5 minutes. I ordered the montreal smoked  meat omelette and wife ordered a vegetarian. The lady was going around for coffee refills so had my mug refilled twice. 
In spite of the avg and poor reviews, i found the food really great, decent service at a reasonable price.  
I'm guessing the ones who liked it didn't yelp."}
{"text":"Went today with a friend to an eggsmart for the first time. This eggsmart is under new management as it said on the Groupon I purchased. I went on a Saturday around noon and the service was good. The serving size of the food was better than most breakfast places I've been to. The fish and chips my friend ordered were really good. I ordered the big breakfast with the home fries and turkey bacon which was great. The sausage was a little too salty for my taste. 
Environment is nice and customer service on the day I went was good. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Awesome service awesome breakfast.  So glad they don't salt and pepper the food.  Due to everyone on blood pressure pills happy that chef does not salt food cooked.  Great experience will be back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a decent breakfast place, but didn't want to go to my usual choices (McDonalds or A&W).

Drove by Eggsmart and decided to go in and try it. Tons of food options so you can definitely find something you like.

I got the Southwest Omelet or something similar to that name. It had avocado slices on top, came with rye bread and potatoes. It tasted amazing.

In terms of price, a little under $20 after tip for one person so it is on the higher side than what I usually pay for breakfast, but the taste made it worth it."}
{"text":"This Eggsmart location has been in operation for a few years.  My previous and only visit (before my Yelp life) was unpleasantly oily.  I had never returned since.  I returned today because of a buy one get one free coupon from the local Economists paper placed by the new management.

We ordered a Benie with 6oz Sirloin Steak ($14) and a Meat Lover Omelet ($11). The omelet was quite tasty; it actually tasted like a meat lover pizza.  The meat chucks could be a little bit smaller.  The home fries that came with it were average.  My BF wished they were crispier.  The benie was perfectly done. It looked pretty. The steak was undercooked to medium rare which was a lesser sin than overcooking it.  It tasted okay with added salt. I loved the French fries that came with the benie.  They were crispy on the outside and warm and tender inside.  They were not oily.

The services was friendly. The waitress refilled coffee ($2.55) three times.  The coffee was quite good, better than the HK cafe coffee for sure. 

It is noteworthy that sandwiches are available for lunches.  Early breakfast special, running from 7am - 10am Monday to Friday, is a good deal.  For $5, you get 3 eggs, bacon/ham/sausage, plus Texas toasts and home fries.

There is a marked improvement over the previous management. I probably would come back when I feel like all day breakfast."}
{"text":"We come here regularly Saturday mornings for their special before 10am. $4.99 for 3 eggs, toast, home fries (I always change mine to spicy fries bc I like the crisp) and choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.  It's the same special as their weekday except you need to order a drink on weekends.  This is fine by me! The portions are generous.  Service is quick and accommodating.  We've been taking our baby there and they're always accommodating to find a spot where we can sit comfortably.  Now that our baby is a toddler, they always bring extra plate without prompting.  It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot if you want consistent breakfast food.  The French toast is quite good as well!"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon last week and was pleasantly surprised. The food was great! Fresh, hot and fast! Prices were right and the service was above and beyond the friendliest I've come across In a long time! I came with my 14 month old twins, sister and mom. The server was so wonderful with the kids and the bus boy even had wonderful manners. My sister had a poutine breakfast platter which she said was the bomb dot com and my mom had steak and eggs which wasn't bad either. I opted out for fish and chips ... I was craving it ... The fish wasn't the best but the chips were very good and crispy with a batter coating. All in all this place isn't bad... I'll be back again if I'm in the area but probably only for the pancakes/breakfast options. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Service is so slow and the food preparation takes longer than any breakfast place I've been to.
It's not even busy.  
Only been serviced well there by the \"filipino\" lady."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here on my way to the mall, and I didn't get a chance to check all the reviews.. I'm glad I didn't because I really don't know what all of the negativity is about. I walked in, was greeted by a very nice young lady, was seated very quickly and my order was taken immediately. I ordered the Montreal smoked meat eggs benedict and it was delicious! The eggs were perfectly soft poached and the Hollandaise sauce was fantastic. A lot of people were complaining that their English muffins were burnt, but mine was totally fine. I'm wondering if it's a timing issue, because I got there right at 9 a.m. and the place was empty. 

The only negative thing I can say about this place was that the bathroom was a bit of a disaster. Toilet paper was on the ground, there were no paper towels to wipe your hands with , and the hand dryer didn't work LOL

Overall I would say if you're in the area give this place a shot. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"They have a good number of options to choose from and everything looks real good.  Service was fast and friendly, place looks nice and food was ready quickly.  But I don't know if they did any better than I could have done myself, and $16 for a omelette and a coffee seems a bit much."}
{"text":"A great place for brunch!!
Nice location, good and clean interior, good food and great service.

We went there quite few times, had few of their famous 4 egg omelettes... Garden Fresh Vegetarian, Mushroom & Swiss Cheese, Triple Cheese, Montreal Smoked Meat. Also had their Grilled Triple Cheese Sandwich and Classic Club House Sandwich. Always tasted good, always satisfying."}
{"text":"This is one of the really good EggSmart.
The interior is nice and clean, the server was excellent with great service and attention. Food quality is better than many of the other EggSmart locations.

We had the Montreal Smoked Meat Omelette and 4 Egg Omelettes with Swiss Cheese, Mushrooms and Tomatoes..... Both were good  :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to some pretty terrible breakfast restaurants, but this is by far the worse. Not only is the service terrible because the servers are too busy talking amongst themselves, but apparently they also do not read orders. I ordered a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel and received only a cream cheese bagel. I then told them what I had ordered and as they went to check I was told they didn't read the order and somehow missed the entire smoked salmon part that was written on the order. I was then given back the same bagel with a slice of salmon on top. I'm sorry, but I did not just come here to order and pay for something I can easily make at home. This will be the first and last time at this Eggsmart. I would not recommend this Eggsmart to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was great; staff are friendly, attentive, and cheerful without being overbearing.
In terms of food:
Their breakfast stuff is where it's at. The poached egg with salmon meal was great, and their mixed breakfast plates (i.e. eggs, meat, toast) are well priced and the portion sizes are very good.
The burger on the other hand was not good. A friend that ordered the caesar wrap didn't enjoy that either. Seems like it'd be safest to stick to breakfasts and avoid the lunch options at this diner.
They also do fresh squeezed orange juice for $4 which is tasty but a little pricy.


A pretty solid breakfast place overall and even better if you get one of the dishes that they do really well."}
{"text":"upon seated, the server instantly asks if i want coffee or orange juice and i choose orange juice without even knowing the price. the server then came with juice and menu. \"how much can a cup of orange juice cost\"  oh boy was i naive,$5 for a glass of orange juice. No refills. the breakfast is in big portion but tastes average. saussage is really really salty, and i don't see any special taste or uniqueness of the orange juice. they have the 5.99 breakfast promotion so my boyfriend and i went expecting to spend roughly $15, but left with $25 because of the juices. felt cheated."}
{"text":"So my husband and I had an hour to kill so we decided to come in and try out there breakfast. Before I continue I will say I'm not exactly a fan of breakfast, especially eating out.

We were greeted by our waitress. I can't recall her name but she was friendly and helpful. The place itself is nothing special, just your typical Canadian diner style restaurant.

I decided to order the pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausages and hash brown. I typically am not a big eater but considering what you get out there for the prices these days I decided to order a lot.

Omg!! The portions are huge.. the pancakes were the size of my head and thick. Eggs were cooked perfectly and sausage was just alright. The hash brown was not what I was expecting. Instead it was potatoes cooked. I was hoping for your typical crispy hash brown but they were still tasty.

The freshly squeezed juice they make there is so good. I usually don't like orange juice because of the high acidity but it was perfect!

This place has great prices for what they give you. 

I probably would not return only because like I said I'm not a fan of breakfast but if I did I would probably try one of their lunch options."}
{"text":"Ordered the Banquet Burger and Big Breakfast.  Burger was delicious (fresh off the grill) and breakfast was good.  The home fries were cooked well this time."}
{"text":"Pretty busy on Saturday morning.  The lady serving us looks exactly like the owner of SS Kitchen off Island rd?!  

Came in for a quick breakfast after dropping off our cars at Second Time Around Tire store across the street and the place was almost full on a Saturday morning.  

The service was brisk and our coffee cups were topped up promptly but the hollandaise sauce that topped my husband's unfortunate eggs benny looked goopy and chunky like it was just thrown together out of a packet.  All together a very disappointing looking eggs benny I've seen in a long while.

My traditional western omelet fared only a little better but then again....the quality of the food was exactly as I should have expected at a franchise breakfast/brunch joint.  

Not a bad value or terrible food but definitely not the kind of place I would go out of my way for sustenance."}
{"text":"Went with the smoke meat Benedict. The meat was tender and flaky. The Hollandaise sauce was good, the eggs were a bit over poached but still had a little runniness to it. Meal came with potato chunks.

We also got the big breakfast which we had a coupon for. Buy one get one free. Great deal. So I also got a chance to try the sausage and bacon which were both good.

When taking orders for the drinks the waitress simply asked me, Orange? and I said okay. When I get the bill I'm shocked. $4 for orange juice? Man, they really take advantage of you here. I could buy a whole jug of Tropicana for the same price. Oh well, its a lesson learned. If you order coffee refills are free.

Our waitress was really friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"So I don't think much of this place.
I've been there 3 times and each time was okay service.
Each time I got the western omlette, there was HUGE chunks of green bell pepper. I couldve made it better at home.
There was 3 male servers, they all looked tired, my home fries weren't cooked. They were raw. When I told the waiter he said \"its homefries its supposed to be like that,... Don't talk to me about it I didn't cook it\". I found this so rude and lost my appetite.
Not returning"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. If I could give a zero star I would. This was the second and last time I will go to this particular restaurant. The first time the server was quite rude when we could get her attention, the restaurant felt about 30 degrees inside and they had no ice for glasses of water but and the coffee was almost room temperature. This time I arrived 1/2 hour before thier posted hours closing time and I was told that you can only have breakfast to go! Who the hell takes out fried eggs?"}
{"text":"Got the early bird special - $4.99 for 3 eggs, sausage, home fries and toast. Such a good deal! Good portion and the waitress was very nice. The special is from 7am to 9/10am I believe."}
{"text":"Sweet! !!!
Same owners as scarborough,  and same eggcelent service. Awesome energy in the place.  Food is great but the atmosphere is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Unhappy. Went to this location for brunch with my family one Sunday morning/afternoon. Surly waitstaff, weak coffee, loud music, quiet TV, and c*** food. Waste of money, will not return before improvements are made. Much prefer Sunset Grill 2 minutes down the road."}
{"text":"I can never get a seat here on the weekends but I had better luck during the week day with take out. I was able to call in 5 minutes prior and when I arrived it was ready. The price is average for a breakfast joint, the food was fresh and tasted good. Satisfied my greasy spoon craving! A keeper in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Love this place. $5.99 for simple breakfast and that is my to go place for quick eat and to work. Very friendly customer service! I keep going back even if I have to have to go meal to save some time."}
{"text":"Liked it. On a busy Saturday morning, food took like 2 minutes. Home fries could use more spices.  The truly fresh orange juice is delicious; the $4 it cost me was worth it. Addictive. Service was fine, but without those  fake smiles that are becoming the norm in some places, and which only show the level of desperation of the customer service people to keep their jobs.  Honest good food. Period."}
{"text":"Morning peeps! The place just realized get for you. The best thing to try would be the freshly squeezed orange juice, though a bit steep but the crave is worth it. Service is pretty well and the food is worth it for the price. No jokes for spinach lovers : Feta cheese and spinach omelette to get hooked on to."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Eggsmart, never again.
The service was horrible, slow and there was hair in my pancake.
SO GROSS. DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"On a weekday morning service took a LONG time to get to us.  That said, the server was the most motherly friendly lady you could find.  Food is eh-ok for a breakfast diner,  my usual complaints of not having enough seasoning but I believe you get what you order!  I ordered a very generous portion of french toast and unfortunately no real maple syrup served here!  

That said, for an early morning pick me up... we were full. :)"}
{"text":"Where do i start! place too small to accommodate the tables they have in it. The smell is so bad the place is not properly ventilated, the AC efficiency it's so low you will be sweating and dripping within minutes, the servers are trying but do not have much experience, the food is less than average for the price, the potatoes that are served with the eggs taste like they are raw, the table, the decor, the whole place is outdated, eat breakfast somewhere else trust me save yourself this experience here."}
{"text":"The most disgusting brunch I have had so far. They did not have vegetarian option for eggs benedict so they offered spinach which looked like right out from frozen box. The only good thing I had in the meal was the fries."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Friday in early June. My sister found this location on yelp. This is a nation chain and this has better service. We got there at 7am and sat down. They have early bird breakfast $5.99 -toast, dice potatoes, eggs, bacon, slices of fruit. Our waitress was nice and good on refills. My meal came out fast and it was delicious for $5.99. I pAid with my credit card and waitress brought out the credit card charger it was charged very quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Best breakfast place in Toronto. We r on a holiday & have visited the 1923 egglinton eggsmart branch almost everyday. The service the food & the people here are par excellent. This place is just \"EGGSILENT\" ha ha ha. A must visit"}
{"text":"Most eggsmarts offer a nice atmosphere I always find this location to be very hot owner doesn't like to spend money. You can't enjoy dining in when you can't breath,they have one waitress who has been there a long time (chinese lady) .I suggest her section very pleasant and always on the customers side.food also seems very expensive for the portions served"}
{"text":"The oatmeal here is great! It has a ton of fruit in it and the coffee is great!! The location was perfect right next to Starbucks"}
{"text":"The food quality is just \"meh\". So oily and tasteless. 
The Service is below average. They did not ask me what kind of toast I want or they forgot to bring the sour cream with my order.
I definitely tried much better breakfasts..."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service. No fuss but nothing special. Great for families, groups and those who are looking for a simple breakfast, brunch, lunch."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this location. The owner came over to have a chat and upon recognising our accents (zimbabwean) had a chat about his travels in Africa as well. This location is spick and span! Meaning absolutely clean. There was a young boy who was working there...the cutest little boy ever. Very mannerly and helpful. Would walk by and top up our coffee and ask if we needed anything. Just a darling! The inside was neat and clean. Everything arranged immaculately as you can see from the photos. The food was very good and we had some of the owners habanero and scotch bonnet special hot sauce.  Boy was it hot but amazing! If you love hot sauce ask to taste it. I am very impressed with the place. He mentioned he owned a few other eggsmart locations as well. Downtown could really take some advice from him. Food was good...my mum who seldom eats when we go out thoroughly enjoyed her meal. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very delicious brunch place, had the classic breakfast with bacon and ham. Soup is good too. There are lunch specials everyday service is good but slow. Not many customers but took forever to cook"}
{"text":"What a cool little breakfast spot. Not too expensive & not dirt cheap. Had breakfast today here. Eggs Benedict w home cut fries (not the crappy deep fried ones) & a side of toast. Meal was & the coffee was solid. No issues. The wait staff \"Jessica\" was polite & attentive. This is a definite do-over."}
{"text":"Love breakfast foods at an affordable price. This place is friendly and the waitstaff are great!! Always friendly, even at 6 a.m. Worth going for the smile :)"}
{"text":"One of my co-workers recommended Egg Smart to me, pitching it as \"better than Cora's and cheaper!\", so I had to give it a shot.  There are multiple locations of this brunch chain but I went to this one because there was parking and it's close to my house.

The menu is far inferior to that of Cora's, it just didn't make want to eat everything available on the menu.  I was looking for a dish that would give me mounds of fruit, but there was none of that.  I don't recommend going here if you're trying to get a tasty, but light brunch.  They just had the usual eggs, omlettes, bacon, sausages, pancakes, french toast, etc.  Their fruit turned out to be a thin slice of cantaloup and a thin slice of orange - very disappointing.

If this was the free breakfast at a hotel, it'd be acceptable but nothing about this menu impressed me.  The place looked like the inside of a Coffee Time and we weren't even sure if there was table service at first.  The service was not bad, but I prefer my friendly local brunch eatery to this place."}
{"text":"Who serves burnt toast? They do. I don't understand how the cook misses it then the expediter then the server.   I had a burger. Greasy crab is the best way to describe it."}
{"text":"Looking for a breakfast place on our trip, as we were leaving the area.  Ordered pancakes, omelettes, bacon and orange juices.  Everything good... Omelettes ok.  All in all, a good place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"So bad. I would go into greater details but it would just sound rude. Garbage food. Bad service. Cold and bland. Unfortunately Eggsmart is just a sh*t franchise regardless of where you go it sucks."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5
Came on a weekend, so it was really quiet. Staff was attentive and pleasant, but food was very average. 
I could have whipped up way better eggs for a fraction of the price, so it was disappointing since on the menu everything looks so enticing.
I must note how I forgot some belongings in the restaurant and the server chased me halfway through the parking lot, so brownie points for effort."}
{"text":"Came in to indulge on brunch and left wishing I went to McDonald's for breakfast. My eggs benedict was pretty average, but the home fries were the real culprit of ruining this meal. Undercooked and needed some more flavour. Spinach feta omelette was nothing to take note of. Have always come across eggsmart restaurants over and over, intrigued about how good a breakfast would be. Next time I'll keep on passing by."}
{"text":"My friend and I love the quiet atmosphere and friendly waitresses every Sat morning after our workout. I had been to a couple other Eggsmart location, yet, I found this is the best one in the area. The one on Leslie and 16th is pretty good too, however, I like the closure and separation in this location better."}
{"text":"No complaints, decent food good service. Monday AM low peak hour so nit sure how it is on a weekend etc. Overall good."}
{"text":"Im sorry to hear Helen had a bad experience :S 

I happen to like this place because in Scarborough there are hardly any places for breakfast it's either Cora's in Pickering or this place.
(If anyone else knows places in Scarb. tell me!).

Anyways I like it here, the food was ok and it comes in big portions, I never finish it.  I don't like homefries in the morning so they let you substitute those for cut up tomatoes. 
Im not the biggest fan of how they make sunnyside up eggs, they are alittle too runny for my liking.  But that is just me.  

Im not a fan of their coffee I'll give you that, it's too weak for my liking.
I think the staff dont really personalize your visit, they want you in and out which isnt a good feeling, you want to feel welcolmed.
This place is ALWAYS packed but I have never had to wait for a table.

I'd give the food a 3/5, it could be alittle more less greasy.  
But if I compared this to CJ's Diner down the street THAT place is gross! and Eggsmart is devine! lol 

I think this is a place where it's hit and miss for good food.  Then again if you're a breakfast place you should be able to handle the crowds and demand for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the worst location ever. It's on Perkopolis with a 2 for 1 deal...which makes it worth the drive for me. These are not coupons, they are DEALS as a part of being a member of Perkopolis. But the manager of the store has decided to no longer honor it making up a fact that they are expired even when showing him the deal that has NO EXPIRY on it. He however offered a $2 off entree deal which is on the SAME Perkopolis places. That is terrible customer service and I won't be returning there.

Not to mention it took about 2 hours to get in and out. The service is awful and you have to wave people down and whistle to get some sort of attention."}
{"text":"Being next to my house, I go here quite often. The food is usually prepared quite nicely. The only issue ever is that there seems to be a lot of confusions with the servers, making it a sometimes frustrating experience. The last time I was in there, I got my Benedict on a piece of soft, soggy, white toast instead of an english muffin...without being told they were out of english muffins. When I confronted the waitress she apologized and said it was her fault. This kinda sucks because it ruined my meal...which I would NOT have gotten if they were out of the necessary ingredients to make it. But the worst part of it was that I wasn't even offered a discount or any compensation which should have been done immediately."}
{"text":"Came here to meetup with an old friend.  Monday morning around 9:30am.  Not busy at this time, lots of parking.

Our waitress was super !! Friendly and efficient.  Food was good, i got the early bird classic - scrambled eggs, sausauge, whole wheat toast and home fries.  I ask for decaf, and got a fresh brewed cup.
Very good service!

Only thing is the toast .... is not toasted enough, it taste like margarin on reg bread.

Tip, if you order well done bacon or ham, they may not get it right. ( my friend orders this and he says they never get it right.

3 stars for the food.
4.5 stars for the service.

Will try again."}
{"text":"Convenient, Reasonable, fast service and pleasant customer service
 Although I read a host of negative reviews for Eggsmart I deferred to try it out for myself.  So after having reading the bad reviews and enjoying a very pleasant experience at Eggspectation I had no expectations for Eggsmart.

We entered to a evenly populated restaurant and were greeted quickly by our server. To start off, we ordered two Hot Chocolates with whip cream.

I had the three cheese omelet  with wheat toast and french fries. Mom had the Mediterranean Omelet.
 I kid you not my food was on the table in less than 5 mins.  The portions were huge. I had to extend my hands far from the plate to take the pics since the plates were so large. I could definitely tell the food was plastered in butter...sorry arteries, luckily I don't eat like this too often. But nonetheless I was satisfied. Eggsmart served it's purpose and I have no complaints about the establishment or service."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. Staff are friendly. I had the eggs with pea meal bacon and asked for a side of hollandaise to create my own eggs Bennie it was delicious. Coffee is average breakfast place coffee. We have been here a handful of times and have enjoyed our breakfast each time."}
{"text":"Groupon ad was misleading. I purchased 30 dollars worth of food but they only let us use 15 dollars because we were only 2 not 4 as they claimed is needed to make use of the offer. This was not in the fine print.  Food wise, it was ok but very high on calories. Can't imagine coming here often"}
{"text":"Parking is impossible here. 

Deal with it if you liked poached eggs.   It's one of the only places in Toronto that I can get good poached eggs - and that they'll ask if I want them runny, regular or hard - and deliver on my request.  

Bathrooms are clean for Toronto/Scarborough.  The clientele can be a bit hmmmm not smooth.  

Rye toast and poached eggs - they make this a good choice for me for a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We ordered the egg white scrambler with sweet potato fries, an omelette with green peppers, mushrooms and provolone cheese and a grilled cheese with fries for my son. Everything tasted fresh however the omelette needed some sauce or something to give it a kick. I would definitely add sauces to the omelette otherwise it tastes bland. A nice place to visit to get fresh tasting breakfast."}
{"text":"I wish I'd read the reviews first .... I agree there should be a 0 star rating option. I was the first person in this morning, about 10 minutes later another couple came in at another table.  I had already placed my order at this point.  Both tables' food came out together.   My turkey bacon was freezer burned & terrible.  1/2 my home fries were hard & burnt.  The server didn't come around at all to check in or top up my coffee (she was sitting at another table talking on her phone).  I was done, sat a couple of minutes and then she attended to the other couple first with coffee top-up and a little chat before coming to me.  The bill came - $2.25 for unlimited coffee and I didn't even get a full cup out of my experience."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Honestly, I've been to this location several times with good experiences, BUT this time, for my birthday lunch on my suggestion, things went progressively from bad to worse.  Our server was very courteous and apologetic when someone in our party had to return her meal 3 times because her eggs came back wrong.  By the time she finally got the right order and started eating, the rest of our party was almost done.  When the bill came we hoped there would be an adjustment to show goodwill for the inconvenience but there was absolutely no mention of it.  The Manager didn't even come over to check on her to see if everything turned out okay.  We asked to speak with him and he refused to come over to our table.  When he realized we were going up to him to speak, he ran to the back and stayed there while we waited for him to come out (he didn't come out).  Shame on this \"Manager\" for caring only about managing himself than to provide the appropriate customer service.  I went from recommending this location to the opposite, including losing me as a regular customer."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Eggsmart this mornng.  I've had breakfast at Eggsmart in my 'hood many times and enjoyed it.

I ordered the Signature Breakfast with bacon and a milk ... and it was delicious!  Because I was there before 11am, the breakfast was only $4.99!!

Sajjad was my server and he was very friendly and took good care of me.  He kept checking back on me and chatting with me."}
{"text":"This morning Gord and I went to Eggsmart for a late breakfast ... we hadn't been since March.  

Gord had Montreal Smoked Hash & Eggs ... he liked it very much.  

I had a BLT (without lettuce ... I'm not a fan).   I hadn't had one in a while and it was delicious!  The fries were good and I just had a couple (I was full).  

Nicole was our server and she took excellent care of us.  She was really friendly and fun."}
{"text":"This place looks homie, and is meant to be that way, so expecting a bistro is laughable. There is a tiny waiting area, so if you come here at peak time, there may not be space to wait inside, just like most restaurants I know, so no one should ever complain about that. Service is good, considering I'm not at nor paying for a dine-in restaurant, I'm happy with the service.
Alright, on with the food. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Egg Bennie. The presentation was perfect. Generous amount of smoked salmon, sauce, and perfectly cooked eggs. The home fries were good, but could be a little less mushy. I asked for soft egg, and it was poached to perfection. The only complain I have was the sauce. Yes, there were plenty of it, but it was bland. Good thing the smoked salmon has enough flavour to almost saved it.
With tips (no drink) my bill came under $15, so it's interesting that some reviewers claim theirs cost $20. Oh well, always read reviews with a critical mind or you will miss out on good food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for Friday brunch at 11am. It was very busy and they looked understaffed. Service was slow. The menu selection was great and our waitress was very nice. Hubby ordered a classic eggs plate and I had a Montreal smoked meat Benny with Jersey shore fries. They had a light crispy coating on it which I really liked. The hollandaise was on the side and it was flavourless and not much volume. There was only a bit of meat on my Benny and I expected more. My English muffin was a bit chewy but my eggs were perfectly poached medium. I did find a hair on the side of my plate. Didn't fuss although I'd usually mention it. Felt bad for the understaffing issue. 

Hubby's plate had a double order of sausages.  He enjoyed it and had little to complain about. I do find that with so many eateries in TO, there's a lot of average or mediocre food that will get you full. I'm disappointed as I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 2:00 for some brunch. I ordered the Peameal Eggs Benedict. My friend ordered the Blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage. 
The waitress took our order when we were ready but forgot about the coffee and water, it wasn't busy and everyone makes mistakes, but we had to order a second time. The food came very quickly which was awesome because we were famished. 
The food was cooked to specifications and was good, as expected from a breakfast chain. The coffee was probably average to below average in strength and taste. The restaurant was warm. Homefries were decent, cooked adequately.
Overall I think the place deserves a 3.5 but I give it a four because although it doesn't break the mold for breakfast restaurants it is perfectly adequate."}
{"text":"Waitress in the mornings during the week, not the greatest and has a bit of an attitude. Friendly at first, but doesn't apologize for any mistakes. If she forgets something, it's probably the customer's fault."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is my favorite breakfast place now, but why you might ask.

well lets start off with the atmosphere, all booth tables are such a great thing for the morning, if you just want to come in eat some breakfast, maybe your hung over and want to be in a cozy booth, well then this is the spot for you.
It is a seat yourself restaurant, so make sure you eye the waiter/waitress down to ensure they see you and know your presence, but never been a real issue for the last two times I have been(they're pretty on top of their game over there).
The lighting there is great, very lively colors.

Now on to the food and the service, the price is right, you really do get what you pay for, and I like that. If your on a budget and you can still get a basic morning meal at a good price and its a good amount of breakfast food for you to enjoy.
Some people might think that eggs are the easiest thing to cook, but I've had some pretty bad eggs in the past and so happy that these chefs know what they are doing.

happy to say I have found this nice gem."}
{"text":"Eggsmart is located right across the street from my place, so naturally I've called ahead to place take out orders. It's relatively cheap and the food itself has never been an issue. However, on at least two occasions, the order I received was not the exact order I had placed. For instance, one time I specifically requested and according to the bill paid the additional fee for bacon to accompany my chocolate chip pancakes, but to my disappointment, no bacon received.

Recently, bf and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast across the street. It was the first time we actually had the dine in experience. Not impressed! We got there shortly after 9 am to beat the morning rush but the place itself was already so noisy. We could barely hear each other across the table. The majority of the noise, in my opinion, stemmed from the staff talking over each other and calling out across the room for each other. Furthermore, as we witnessed, the waitress was rude to several different customers on occasions. No tact. No quality customer service. Lastly, because of the limited seated capacity of the establishment, by the end of our meal, we were sharing our table with a random gentleman. What was left of our meal was eaten in silence as we scurried to make our exit. Awkward."}
{"text":"Great place for weekend breakfast or brunch. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a must have."}
{"text":"I think this place is unfairly overlooked because the Donlands Restaurant is just across the street.

Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Good food.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Sakithi rocks I would suggest to sit at her tables!  
She remember us each month!!  She always greats you with a smile and a big welcome.    

Sakithi try's very hard to get to know you as a person not a table.   She also is nice to have as a host!"}
{"text":"Giving it 1 star only because it won't let me give it 0

Went there this morning and ordered the Montreal smoked meat omelet and 3/4  of the way through I noticed that the rye bread that I'd been eating had mold on it... by far the nastiest food I've ever gotten in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing is ``eggsmart`` about this place.

The service was real slow. Every time a costumer came in the waitress had to run to the door to grab a menu. (this is a seat yourself place). I was eyeing a plate on the counter ready to go, but sat there for at least 5 minutes. With no luck, the plate turned out to be mine. What utter disappointment. The food was cold, but okay tasting. The scrambled eggs were a bit over-runny too.  

Moreover, there are many other alternative breakfast places in the area. Unless, your starving."}
{"text":"We have ordered breakfast a few times from here because its easy and the food is fairly consistent. I usually order an omelette (either southwest or a veggie blend) with the sweet potato fries. The last time we ordered the amount of sweet potato fries was tiny (less than a small handful) and that's annoying when you're paying $2.99 extra for them!). The omelette are huge and worth the money. My husband usually gets the big breakfast but this time he ordered two junior breakfasts which was cheaper for more food. Fun hack. 
They put fruit under the food, so you'll get some super warm cantaloupe and orange, and the toast is usually in a side bag. Comes with way too much butter though. We usually don't eat it. I think if I ordered again I would put a note for them to include an appropriate amount of sweet potato fries ;)"}
{"text":"Not bad. But price jumped up too much for me to recommend. By almost 30%. Sorry egg smart. Not competitive enough in this food landscape."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Both my wife and I had the bacon and eggs. The eggs were a little over cooked and the toast was barley toasted. The home fries were good."}
{"text":"Keeping with the principle that when traveling, one should eat things that are not available at home, I ordered Montreal Smoked Meat Hash. The meat was inedible.  Not because it tasted bad, but because of the poor quality.  Impossible to chew.  Some pieces I couldn't even cut with a knife.  Fortunately there was very little meat in the so-called \"hash. \"   What I ended up with was the most expensive plate of potatoes I ever had.  
Friendly and efficient service, though."}
{"text":"Service was excellent while My order potatoes were over cooked n scrambled egg not perfect.But I loved their fresh orange juice. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Never seen a line for a chain. Lol. Only brunch place in the burbs? I was very surprised by how busy this restaurant was. But the breakfast was fine. Not great but not bad either. The potatoes were on the salty side, but I don't mind salt. The service was quick and efficient, and the portions were good."}
{"text":"This place is looking for wait staff and we know why. We were greeted and served by a rude manager. She is all business. We had our 3 year old son with us and when we tried to get a small packet of Premium Plus crackers for him she said it would cost an extra 25 cents. This is a first for us. Everywhere else we go, like Boston Pizza for example, kids get a little treat, often crackers AND crayons/colouring book. She was so aggressive about informing us of this extra charge that I felt embarrassed about others overhearing it. Sure enough another family we knew was seated a few tables away from us. I don't know how much they heard but if they did then I'm totally embarrassed. Later, she returned and said this time she won't charge us for the crackers. Geez, what a big deal over some crackers that only cost her a few cents. Usually we tip well over 15% but we were so annoyed we left less than a dollar for her to make a point. The food wasn't anything special, just standard breakfast stuff with no extra garnishes like you get at other breakfast places like Cora's."}
{"text":"This place is utter trash I'm actually mad that I'm member of the human race after going to this establishment. Within my 17 years on earth, I've always loved breakfast and breakfast loved me, until I went to this eggsmart. Now I can't even touch a home-fry without having PTSD, but I've rambled too long. Let's go into my experience with this atrocious restaurant. To start, I love the brand of eggsmart, the company and I even own eggsmart merchandise. I love their marketing, and I do think they're eggs are smart ;). I've been to many eggsmart in my short life and I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience at every single one I've been to. BUT NOT ANYMORE. This restaurant has completely destroyed any hope I've had in this company. It was a utter disappointment when my biracial friend and I walk through the singular door to be met with no greeting, no service, and absolutely no \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice. Every time I wanted something I had to raise my hand and yell \"LADY\". I ordered the \"early bird special\" A STAPLE OF THE EGG SMART BRAND however my meal was not early NOT birdy and EXTREMELY NOT SPECIAL!, let's start with a favourite of mine the home fries, undercooked under seasoned and UNDERWHELMING, these raw potatoes slices left me as salty as the sausages, if you can even call them that! I'm honestly not even sure that they were sausages, I'm disgusted. Not to mention I had to ask for WATER! It took her about 15 minutes to find the tap! And the water was lukewarm and iceless! What establishment serves ICELESS WATER! I've thrown up 3 times today due to the god awful ambience (-2/10), APPALLING SERVICE and disturbing food, I didn't take second or third bites of anything on my plate. To all those who have went to this establish (disappointment) I feel sorry for you, your families, your children, it wasn't your fault."}
{"text":"Go there every weekend.

Menu has been updated/changed, when we started going there last year the bills were coming to $25. Since the change we've been getting $35 bills.. May have to re-evaluate our visiting schedule.

Service, fast, so fast she doesn't even ask if we want coffee just brings it, sometimes we don't feel like coffee and feel obligated to take it.

Just started looking at our bills(we will look at menu next visit) 2.99 for the substitute salad and 1.99 for cheese in omelette. Omelette was 10.99, coffee was hot but average for $2.49.

Food - omelette is always above well portioned and not greasy. toast hit and miss(sometimes burnt we can't be bothered to complain)

Will we return, don't know. 
Do I recommend? Not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Folks should really visit a place at twice before declaring it a disappointment. We all have good and bad days guys. 

I always prefer a meal at Eggsmart than munching on a burger at MacD with a defrosted patty. And I somehow always had good experience. And this particular location doesn't disappoint either.

All standard fare on an Eggsmart menu. I've tried the omelettes and egg scrambles. Accompanying fries and bread is fresh and crisp. Fresh orange juice is, well, fresh. Servers are nice and professional enough to warrant a tip. No problem with parking. 

Hassle free outing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good on what's expected at any decent Eggsmart in GTA. Service was courteous and attentive.

We had Garden fresh vegetarian omelette and Super Scrambler with chicken + mushrooms. Really loved the Jersey Shore fries. Coffee was quite alright.

A good brunch overall."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast this morning and were expecting the same quality we've experienced in the past.

It was clear from the moment we walked in that something very serious had changed with the restaurant. For starters, no one greeted us. After a few minutes of standing at the door, one of the cooks said to go sit down.
There was 1 waitress working, an older blond lady. This review is nothing to do with her, or the level of service she provided. She did her very best considering all of the circumstances thrown at her. She was running her self all around that restaurant waiting on 10 tables at once. 

All the while, to our surprise, there was another server hidden somewhere in the back. She appeared, dirty and disheveled, as if plucked off the street corner. Shirt was dirty, bleached spots everywhere and she was wearing combat boots and a scowl. She didn't say a word to a single customer as she shuffled through the restaurant randomly picking up plates and ignoring customers entering at the front. 

Her appearance only augmented the fact that the restaurant appearance was shabby and disorganized. Piles of dishware and spray bottles littered the tops of visible counters and freezers in the service area. The kitchen area had piles of visible plates and pre-made food. The one chef continuously wiped at his nose without rewashing his hands. The other was wearing a bluetooth headset.

The food was confusing. Bacon was so over cooked it was essentially pork charcoal. Ham was actual deli ham from what looked like a lunchables container. It was that small. The hash browns were burnt nuggets that not even ketchup could save. Pancakes were tasteless and heavy. My silly bf ordered a side of soup for $3.59 extra. It was straight up Campbells from a can, no doubt. 

While we were there, a couple Skip The Dishes deliveries were being picked up. This drives me crazy. If you can't satisfy the customers you have sitting in your restaurant, you have no right to be advertising extra services. I have no doubt the people who received their delivery were even more disappointed than we were. At least we received our food \"hot off the grill\".

We commended a family who walked in, spent a few unserviced moments at both the door and their table. They walked out a few minutes later. We were so jealous of them in that moment, but unfortunately, we had already made our choice. 

I would avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick and cheap lunch.  The portions are generous and the service is consistent. The Big Breakfast is a good option with a lot of food for the hungry (eggs, toast, pancakes, potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham, and a little bit of a fruit).  I wouldn't expect much from their \"fancy\" offerings, but the breakfast basics have always been decent."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a breakfast place.
If you get here before 11am - you get an 'early bird special for 4.99 - I believe it's their Eggsmart Breakfast including toast, bacon, ham & eggs etc.

The waitress complemented the restaurant - she was social, seems to know all the regulars, & made regular rounds to check on you. 

Pros:
- Efficient service
- Sunny area with lots of windows
- Clean
- Food is decent 

Cons:
- Understaffed (but I believe they didn't expect a crush that almost filled their restaurant when we got there)"}
{"text":"Not very clean, 
Undercooked ages, over cooked steak, burned bread.
The waitress was kind and apologetic though."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny and fruit waffle - everything was tasty, fresh and reasonably priced - one of our favourite places in the area."}
{"text":"The presentation was good, but the eggs were a little bit over cooked and tasteless, no salt or pepper on their food. Potatoes were okay and the bacon crispy.  But they should try to use more salt and pepper, specially on the hollandaise salt, totally tasteless!
The wait staff is kind and helpful, always refill coffee and checking if everything is okay."}
{"text":"This was a pretty decent breakfast place, the food was tasty and it wasn't overly pricey. I had 3 eggs over easy, toast, turkey bacon and home fries and I was very satisfied. It didn't wow me, but I would definitely come back here again! If you're looking for good traditional breakfast food than this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"Given the stiff competition, it is surprising that they can't do better. Its name alone does suggest that they do various offerings of eggs but they don't really: fried, boiled and scrambled. This joint is for the basic bread and butter clients. Not a lot of fancy.

We noticed that before seating us, they didn't do a good job in cleaning our table. Just with a dry towel?! Dropped the food debris under the table of which we will be stepping on while seated.

The waiters and waitresses' uniforms we're dirty from stains of the breakfast meals distributed. You can see the sweat coming from the underarm of one of the male servers wearing a short sleeve black shirt...yuck... and he took our order!!!

We still gave a tip because waitering is a tuff work damnit!

Their orange juice didn't seem freshly squeezed and their potatoes were drenched in a lot of oil. Their menus were stained, they should plastify them and clean them instead of using tired and dirty menus.

This was certainly not a good day for our visit. There was a disgruntled former employee who complained about her pay infront of their patrons.

It was quick(we left ASAP) and it was nasty.. unfortunately. Started taking pictures but here not warranted no pix-I say.

If I was the franchisor I would make sure that franchised restaurants at least follow-up guidelines for quality food and cleanliness in a more strict manner.

I've been to another one in Mississauga and we didn't get this!! 

If I was the franchisee, ask yourself am I loosing potential revenues on things easily avoidable? After \" location, location, location is presentation, presentation, presentation.\" $$"}
{"text":"well, for that price I can do my own eggs, bigger, faster and warmer when served on my plate... waiters/waitress are not trying to be more than cold/medium."}
{"text":"The service in this location is awesome!! It's like the waitresses know everyone that comes. I love eating here with my friends, great food"}
{"text":"Got seated at 10:45. 11:45 food was delivered and was all wrong. Veggie omelette - asked for little to no oil to be used - delivered bathed in oil. Second omelette. Asked for a classic western. Got a Southwest with no side of bacon. 

Walked out. Never to return. Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never had the chance to go to Eggsmart since the go-to breakfast spot for me was Cora's, or the one-off breakfast diner, but the wife and I figured we'd give it a shot.

Waitress was very polite and friendly - not often do you hear \"Good morning.\" But then again.... how often do I wake up at 7am on a Sunday? Rarely.

Prices are pretty comparable to Cora's. A plate of food will cost you anywhere from $10-20, depending on if you get a drink or not.

Our food came out pretty quickly - much faster than Cora's. Ended up getting your typical breakfast: 3 eggs scrambled, bacon, toast, fruit and \"Jersey Shore\" fries which, much like the cast of the show, were crispy and golden brown. If you like the fries at Costco, these are pretty close to them.

My only comment is that my scrambled eggs were cooked just a tad too long, a bit on the fried eggs side, but no biggie."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day and it was super busy. I can honestly say that this restaurant is one of my go to places for breakfast. The servers are really friendly and nice. They are always aware of the things you need and when you ask for something you don't ever need to remind them twice. The portion size is really big. I usually order the 4 egg omelette and it is quite filling. It comes with your choice of home fries or french fries and 4 pieces of whole wheat or white toast. The eggs Benedict is also a very good dish as well. It is a bit pricey but you are paying for quality food with amazing service."}
{"text":"6/27/15: I would say that this Canadian chain's food quality is in the same group as our American Denny's, but maybe a little less tasty.  However, they took FOREVER to serve our food here.  We waited so long for the food that when it did arrive we told them we had to go and had them pack it up cause we were already behind schedule.  That really sucked.

1. Glass of Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice C$3.99:  Definitely tasted fresh squeezed.  Was good enough.  5/10.

2. Peameal Provolone Melter C$8.99:  After having our amazing peameal bacon at Carousel Bakery in Toronto, we were looking for the stuff everywhere!  Well, this ain't nothing at all like the Carousel's version.  Just a bunch of what we Americans call \"Canadian bacon\" in a sandwich.  Fries were good, sandwich tasted okay, but nothing notable.  5/10.

3. unknown breakfast sandwich?:  Not sure what this was from the pictures, cause it doesn't match any of the menu items I see.  But anyway, I don't remember anything about it, so I assume it was nothing special.

The food's pretty standard.  Again, just a bit worse than Denny's, which is my calibrator for a 3.  But since it took so amazingly long to get the food and kinda made us rush our trip, I think I'd rather just go to Denny's...

2/5

{"text":"It's a decent place to have a breakfast. This place was quite small and walking spaces were narrow. Tables were close to each other and not 100% clean prior. The menus were foldable pamphlets, sticky and worn out but still able to read. I have ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Hash. The orders were placed and food was served quickly. I was surprised by the size of my breakfast. It had a pile of home fries, quite a few smoked meats, eggs of your choice (mine was scrambled) and caramelized onions at the bottom. The dish also served with 4 corners of toasts. 

FOOD:
- smoked meat was tasty
- too much potato 
- eggs were creamy
- if you mixed everything together and put some of each ingredients in your mouth at the same time, flavours worked really well"}
{"text":"Came here today with a bunch of us friends (7 of us) and surprised that hey were able to accommodate us. Restaurant is busy on weekends and servers are very friendly and refill our coffee without breaking a smile. We ordered some omelettes, signature scrambler bowls and waffles and they all looked huge, and tasty (especially the waffles). The fresh squeezed OJ was amazing. All in all it came to a very good price and a great friendly environment. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Amazing service. The owner of the restaurant served us and even let us try some of his special hot sauce. It really tastes good. The only bad part is that he didn't give us the hot sauce as it was not for purchase. The food tastes great for anyone who doesn't care for the hot sauce."}
{"text":"This whole situation was so depressing we left before ordering food, and still spent $4.60 on two drip coffees. 

Interior looks kind of like the grime you get on unscrubbed toilets, umm...what else. Nothing. Nothing at all. 

Does not have a smell."}
{"text":"We went in for an early breakfast on a weekday morning.
Kind service and fresh bottomless coffee. Good way to start the day!
We got the early breakfast special, which is about $6, and it comes with 3 eggs, toast, potatoes, and your choice of bacon or sausage. I'd say it was worth it. Good experience!"}
{"text":"Friendly down to earth and colourful staff who gripe comically about the various boroughs around the city. Service is prompt, eggs are perfect and they make you feel welcome and never rushed despite the bustle. They were also open all Easter weekend."}
{"text":"Only one waitress when the restaurant was completely full. Food took 30 mins + to arrive and was sub- par. Coffee was burnt tasting and also sub-par. Can't recommend to anyone and will not be returning to this or trying any other location. Be smart, save your money, eat your eggs at home."}
{"text":"The food here was terrible.I ordered the Montreal smoked meat special . It's the first time I didn't finish a sandwich. My son had the 3 eggs & bacon with home fries.I could hardly see the eggs.My smoked meat was from a pouch but hard and over salted. We were the only ones in the place at 2:20 pm. Don't go to Eggsmart on Woodbine.Maybe the other ones are better but this lunch was atrocious for almost $25 with tax & tip.My son didn't even have a drink, just water.My coffee was average, nothing special.All in all it was a poor dining experience..not worth the money
The girl who served us was very friendly, though but the food & atmosphere were uninviting."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I go out for a sit down breakfast, I am glad I did! Excellent service and an extensive breakfast menu is available. Place was packed at 9 am on Saturday morning with quite a multi cultural crowd, which was nice to see. I really liked the meat lover scrambled platter and will definitely return to try other items on their menu and their famous orange juice!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, Nothing special.  Food is OK.  Place is clean.   Would have gave them a 4 Star if not for the food arriving so slowly!  The cooking facilities is inadequate when the seatings are full.  And it is Not the most comfortable place to sit and wait a long time for your food.  3 Star!  I may try again at a less busy hour, just to be fair."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse Eggsmart I've ever been to... Food sucks and you get no service at all. I don't understand how anyone can mess up breakfast food.

We got there around 2pm and the store was pretty empty, a man was leaving at that time. We were the only customers there. After the food arrived, 2 of the staff started cleaning the store, mopping the floor around us while we were eating... 

The waitress never came over and asked if we needed anything, or how the food was. I ordered coffee and she never even bother checking if I needed a refill, or refill for water.

I was very disappointed at the food. I ordered the \"Montreal meat with hash and egg\" (I think that's the name). When the food came it looks fine, until I flipped over the egg... There was a very small amount of meat but chunks of onions. The menu said \"caramelized onions\". All I could taste was regular onion slices, the potato had no flavour. I don't understand how breakfast can taste this bad. 

My boyfriend upgraded his fries to sweet potato fries. But it didn't come with any mayo... The fries looked like they've been here for a while. I'd rather walk across the street and buy A&W sweet potato fries. Why even bother paying more here? 

When the waitress delivered our food over, she asked if we wanted strawberry jam for the toast. Then she took out 3 packs from her apron pocket. I mean, I guess they only had strawberry jam? I remember seeing other Eggsmart have a rack of different variety of jam or peanut butter to choose from. The side of the toast was burnt and the middle was wet... I think there were butter on the toast already. And they expected us to add jam as well? Or what if I didn't even want butter...

I'm never coming back to this location ever. I just opened a Yelp account and this is my first post. Had to leave a review about my experience. Not surprised that others ranked this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"A really good breakfast spot. Cant go wrong with the early bird special. Fast service, and really nice customer service."}
{"text":"This place is fine for what it is. They have some standard breakfast meals. Nothing fancy, just straightforward options. They're pretty quick to get your meal out to you and are prompt.

They're open early so you can pop in before work if needed and also have some take-out friendly menu items if you don't have time to take a seat."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and have had a good experience each time.  I have tried the breakfast plates and the omelettes.  They were all very good and made to order.  I love making breakfast at home but when I need a break, this is convenient.  The service has been friendly and helpful.  I would give 5 out of 5 save for the outside of the building could be brightened up with better ground maintenance (flowers etc.) and of course they are competing with my own home cooking!  :)"}
{"text":"Busy bees in this Kingsway brunch spot. The decor isn't something to rave about. Weird wood coloured wallpaper and brown brick walls were reminiscent of the 90's. The open kitchen looked clean. 

Coffee came quickly and the fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent. The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was ok but I didn't get to choose from soft, medium or hard poached which was a nice choice at Creme de la Creme, a rival brunch spot on this bloor strip. The salmon itself was not as fresh as I would have liked. The home fries came in small quantities and my plate looked to big for the amount of food. The fruit on the plate was fresh and made up for some of the faults.

On a side note I got an eyelash with my food which doesn't bother me but it would bother some. Overall I find \"Creme de la Creme\" better but still not perfect. Only If they took Eggsmart's fresh orange juice to \"Creme\" i would be a non complainer."}
{"text":"If you eat here, you might have to go to McDonald's to wash down the food that you just have eaten. 
Had the Egg Benny. The Holland sauce was yellow in colour. Leave it to that.

They had the wrong type of potatoes. They were terrible. 

Will NOT be back. My mistake for NOT checking Yelp in the first place. Rookie mistake."}
{"text":"The coffee was hot and fresh... I was thoroughly enjoying it until I realized I was drinking from a dirty mug... there was dried coffee residue near the bottom of the mug handle and a lot of dirt down the side that I could easily wipe off with my thumb. 

The meat lovers scrambler was bland and too salty. The fruit on the plate was far from fresh. Jam selection was limited to two. Ketchup bottle was basically empty.

Need to change the name from Eggsmart to Eggdumb. This is my first and last visit to this location... not the level of quality I would expect from an Eggsmart franchise."}
{"text":"I took my family of 5 out for lunch. The place didn't smell good, coffee mugs were dirty, the fruit on the plates were gooey and had to be replaced, the meal was missing items and we had to remind the servers a couple of times, coffee and tea refills had to be requested. We didn't have a dedicated server - 3 different people came to deal with issues and/or bring food. I noticed other food being sent back to the kitchen from other tables. 

I will be surprised if this location is still open by Christmas. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've definitely tried better all-day breakfast joints. The menu options are average, with nothing too exciting to offer. The serving sizes are good and service was average. 
Theres noting much to say about this place but that if you have no other option and are dying of hunger and do not have any patience to search around for another restaurant, then go ahead to Eggsmart."}
{"text":"Everything is just so slow at this Eggsmart's location.

Cubano Ciabatta - Provolone, Peameal Bacon, Sliced Ham, Pickle, Tomato & Lettuce with Dijon Bistro Sauce served on a Ciabatta Bun
- the better of our brunch.. 

Eggs Benedict with Peameal Bacon
- Fail both in taste and presentation. Hollandiaise sauce just crumby with the egg yolks overcooked and tasteless.. the eggs just look pathetic.

Both sounded delicious. Our food took a long time to arrive.. I definitely suggest not to come here for lunch if you are in a rush. Wait and kitchen staffs both got overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This Eggsmart used to be a Tim Hortons! Imagine a Tim Hortons going out of business and got replaced?

This restaurant still have the similar set up like the Tim Horton... The chairs and tables are just too close together.. and especially if the table next to you talking at the top of their voices while you are nursing a hangover... not cool!

Western Sandwich with Salad ($5.99)
- fluffy eggs loaded with green pepper, onion and ham... and cheese............
- Salad is standard mostly lettuce with an Italian dressing

3 Eggs with Sausage and Potatoes ($6.99)
- Sausages sinfully good...
- Just wish for more fruits instead of a small piece of cantaloupe and a thinnest slice of orange I ever seen....
- definitely recommend to come back for weekday early bird special ($4.99) before 10 am

Service is definitely lacking. The wait staffs gives me this old small town vibe... Have to wave them down to get anything and everything... 

I might come back for the food... but the service just leave little to be desired!

Accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up breakfast? Go to this Eggsmart, that's how.

My family and I went to this location for a quick brunch. When we entered the restaurant, it was only half filled, and yet our waitress was pretty atrocious. After bringing our drinks and taking our order, she basically disappeared - I had to flag down a different server to ask for a refill on my coffee.

About half an hour after we placed our order - I'm not exaggerating - our food showed up undercooked and cold. My mother-in-law had to grab cutlery from another table, because our waitress forgot. 

How do you spend 30 minutes cooking a pancake and still manage to serve it RAW and COLD? 

As for the pancakes that weren't raw, they had little flavour and were excessively chewy. On top of the bad food, the cook somehow managed to set his grill on fire while we were eating and the restaurant was filled with smoke. Could this place be any worse?

All told, this was an incredibly disappointing breakfast. It was my first time at an Eggsmart and, God help me, it will also be the last. I'd rather eat dirt than ever again force the food from this restaurant down my throat."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the worst breakfasts I've paid for in Toronto.  Eggsmart is on the way to work, so bf and I went there on a whim one morning for a quick eggs and toast affair.  This affair turned sour in a pretty Fatal Attraction kind of way: the smoked salmon bagel was terrible, with super dried out onions, very little cream cheese or salmon, the bagel wasn't warm, the coffee was vile, and the service was wholly indifferent.  Considering that a dish like that is more of an assembly process than a culinary endeavor, it was really about as bad as it could be without actively ruining it.  We were the only people there and it took forever to get a bill. 

Anyway, I'm baffled as to why this place has not been cast into the core of the sun yet. Time to get Michael Douglas on the case."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place, has everything you need and opens early in the morning. You walk in, and seat yourself. The menus are totally grimey, like they haven't been cleaned in years. Not that big of a deal. There's omelets, breakfast bowls, pancakes, your regular breakfast options. I got a basic breakfast with eggs, home fries and sausage. All of it was really good. The home fries were cold. Everything else was warm though. Overall, good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Do not order the eggs Benedict. Worst ever. The home fries tasted really funky. Like they were fried in old grease. Waitress was excellent but that was the only good thing."}
{"text":"Run of the mill breakfast place, mediocre food.  Lots of other places with better breakfast options."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience today at Eggsmart at Warden and Eglinton. It was my first time ever going to this location. My friend and I went there we were warmly greeted and seated. Table was neat and tidy and we were given our menus and even suggestions. The staff was friendly and courteous and checked in on us every so often to make sure everything was OK for us and to give us more coffee etc. The food was great and very filling (I had the meat lovers scrambled eggs breakfast) I wish all my experiences in restaurants were like this. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This is my second time to Eggsmart and it was a-ok. When we walked in we were greeted with a casual \"sit anywhere you like\" that some might interpret as indifference but the smile and sincerity with which it was said meant make-yourself-at-home. There seemed to be only 1 girl serving the place, which was about half full, but she managed fine and we felt our service was timely.  I ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and Mediterranean Scrambler for $9.99 which I had a hard time finishing. Everything was fresh and the restaurant was clean; the bowl that the food came in was chipped but it is a diner type of place and it didn't affect my meal so it didn't really bother me too much."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Shelly at Eggsmart is the best.  Amazing customer service from her that keeps me coming back as a satisfied customer. Great job Shelly!!!"}
{"text":"Never had a good experience with Eggsmart, but thought I'd give it another try anyway. My home fries were cold. If they're busy it makes sense to cook a whole bunch in advance, but there was barely anyone there. And if you cook it ahead, at least manage to keep it warm. Care a little. Overall wasn't impressed with the food. Minimal flavor.
Also even though there's only 2 other tables in the whole place, I had to wait forever for the waiter to notice I was done. I made eye contact several times, still he didn't clue in to come and take the plate and offer to bring the bill. Brought the bill, left the plate. Very inattentive. Just feels like staff have given up and don't care."}
{"text":"Good service, good portion and hot coffee.  Newspaper given at table as soon as I sat down.  Nice clean and friendly franchise atmosphere.  Home fries do taste a little flat I know they were cooked fresh and bacon a tiny bit waxy .... I am used to The Fry Basket so all is made fresh and not frozen and bacon is really good but thought I would give this place a try.  Not bad when u want a quick breaky."}
{"text":"1 star for the nice decor and 1 star for the overly friendly staff..
The bread was overly buttered which was a huge turn off.
Only got a few potatoes.
Eggs nothing special.
Bacon was undercooked and extremely greasy.
The orange juice was freshly juiced which was really cool!

Won't be coming back anytime soon...
Fix the portions and remove the grease!"}
{"text":"Sat. May 30th I went for the very first time.  I ordered the Big Breakfast.  It came quick and hot and there was so much food I could not finish it.  It reminded me of how DayBreak at Church & Carlon used to be before they cut back on portion sized and really jacked their prices.  If you are looking for a HUGE breakfast and not have to pay an excess amount I was wowed.  Great service too and it was busy; they needed a busser there were only 2 waitresses and they handed it all well but they really could have used an extra set of hands to bus tables."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch around 11am and the place was already packed full of people. The restaurant itself is quite small, so a wait was to be expected. There were only two servers in sight and I had to wave one down to ask how long the wait would be - nobody greeted us at the door. We were seated after about a 15 minute wait (party of four) and given our menus. I had the peameal benny and it was very ok. It wasn't bad, but the peameal bacon had some tough bits which doesn't seem right. The eggs were poached a little harder than I like, and the home fries were nothing to rave about. Service was decent, taking into consideration there were two of them running around - but they seemed pretty stressed. This place is definitely understaffed. Food is mediocre at best. On the plus side, the price is very reasonable and décor is cozy."}
{"text":"I always have good experiences at other Eggsmart locations, so I was pretty happy that an Eggsmart opened closer to me. 
We came on a Monday morning, it was quiet so we were seated right away. I like how the waitress got our drink orders once we were seated. 

We ordered Banana Pancakes, French toast and 3 eggs with bacon and homefries. Everything was tasty and at a good price. Eggsmart also has the option for turkey bacon which we ordered and it was good! 
The waitress will walk around to refill coffee and hot water for tea. 

I would keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Went in today at 3 pm. Saw that everyone was cleaning and rushed to order. They were out of smoke salmon ordered sizzler omelette the egg was mushy and the chicken was rubbery, home fries were covered in oil. I felt kinda gross all day from all the oil. The toast was soft and mushy from all the butter drenching it. I would never go again and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for breakfast. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted and got a table. 

My boyfriend & I ordered the classic breakfast, which consists of 3 eggs (we got it scrambled), toast (we got white), home fries, and our choice of 4 bacon, sausages or ham slices. He got 2 bacon slices and 2 sausages. I got 4 sausages. 

The service was horrible! Trying to get two menus, the waiters attention and order what we wanted took forever.

The food was okay. Scrambled eggs and the thick toast were good, however the home fries were horrible! They were not cooked well, they literally looked like they were mixed in a powder ready to go into a pot to cook. I didn't even touch it. The sausages were okay.. I feel like they were a bit too hard to cut and they were small."}
{"text":"This is probably going to be my shortest review because there really isn't much to say about this place.

I've been coming here quite often this summer because I work near here and I have to say that service is quite slow. (But not Cora's kind of slow)

A good feature of this place is their early bird special which includes 3 eggs of any style, bacon/ham or sausage and home fries with fruits for 4.99 and tax before 10am. That has the most value for a cheap and filling meal! 

As I am writing this review, I am eating a grilled cheese when it was supposed to be a loaded grilled cheese with ham...."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here . Friendly staff who welcomed you . It has the diner feel with a nice atmosphere .   Food  was good ."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend and i's first time there. My friend recommended it to us. This place is by far the WORST breakfast place I've ever gone to!!!!! First of all unbelievable customer service. Our waiter yes did the right thing and asked if we wanted coffee, and drinks. My friend got an orange juice. He said his orange juice tasted like Sunny D. My friend asked for a fruit bowl. WHAT DID HE GET SPOILED ROTTEN FRUIT!!!!!! What you see here on the strawberry has MOLD on it. My friend felt disgusted and said forget the fruit bowl. He didn't even touch it, we were so mad. I on the other hand got the red velvet pancake, tasted dry and very sweet. My boyfriend got the Eggsmart Big breakfast, my boyfriend asked his eggs to be OVER MEDIUM AND IT WAS NOT!!!! IT CAME OUT A RUNNY OVER EASY! His pancakes were so dry and cold and slightly over cooked / burned.
THIS SPANISH MAN DIDNT EVEN SAY SORRY OR OFFER ANYTHING ELSE, WHAT HE DID WAS ROLL HIS EYES AND BITCHED AT THE CHEF.. The waiter didn't even ask my boyfriend and I how we were doing or anything. I was so annoyed to the point where I just grabbed the bill and paid for it."}
{"text":"This seems to be the only breakfast place on Yonge. The reason I start this review with that statement is because it was packed out the door when we showed up. Maybe it was because it was noon and a Sunday but none the less a little gem. The place itself is tiny but does have a nice patio (a little surprising for a breakfast bar). 

The service was extremely rushed. I understand why but I don't think their was a need to be so on the ball to the point as soon as we put our last bite in our mouth they were there clearing our plates. We ordered the BIG BREAKFAST to share. It came with 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of ham, 2 slices of whole wheat toast, home fries and 2 pancakes. It was convenient that everything came in pairs which made it easy to share. We also ordered the 1 liter of fresh orange juice to enjoy. The entire meal was satisfying, tasty and fresh. I didn't get the feeling that my meal was sitting under a heat lamp of any sort. 

I would go back for sure.. I just wish I didn't feel so rushed. That was a turn off for me as I like to sit and enjoy my meal not feel like i'm taking too long."}
{"text":"I've never heard great things about this place, but it was close to where we were so I figured we'd try it. I have to say, though the food was OKAY for the price (cheap!) and it was kid friendly, it was definitely a \"MEH\" if I have ever had one. Also, they were out of MILK (what breakfast place runs out of milk)? Doubt I'll go back again."}
{"text":"First time at an Eggsmart.
The food was good, not anything spectacular but good. Potatoes were slightly firm, some would probably say undercooked but I thought they just had texture. The eggs Benedict was alright, not the best I've ever had but good enough. The waffle was probably the star of the meal. Topped with fruit and served with whipped cream, it came out hot and crispy. 

My only real issue was that the potatoes had a decent amount of oil under them, and on the website the nutritional value is around 0.2g of fat per serving. I don't believe this, would say probably around 15g with that oil. Not a big deal to most people but I'm a bodybuilder in contest prep and I count my daily macros, so it was a big deal to me. 

Overall, would go back."}
{"text":"Love it! The breakfast classic with 3 eggs, 4 bacon, two slices of bread fruits. Newer clean place."}
{"text":"The staff work as a team and are very pleasant. They remember me from last time and was very impressed. They made their signature home fries dish and I'll consider it next time. Eggs Benedict w/peameal on an english muffin was on my bucket list for a long time. It was such a delectible, creamy texture. ($10) The clubhouse ($10 add Cheddar $2) featured moist chicken. We also added two orders of sausage ($6) and I'd suggest splitting an order instead. The orange juice you can tell isn't store. Orange juice is great for hangovers ($4 standard glass). Bottomless coffee is always a win. ($40/COUPLE + TIP)"}
{"text":"Service was amazing but the food wasn't so great. The eggs had no salt, the pancakes were burnt. I could make better scrambled eggs and pancakes at home. I liked how they kept coming back to refill the coffee though."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast waitress was friendly but brought a western omelette instead of the meat scrambler which I ordered
Looking at the well done(burnt) omelette   I was surely hoping my meal was not in the same shape
Forgot my water but sure filled up my coffee 
Lots of choose from on the diverse menu and it surprisingly got busy for the lunch crowd boy were they in for a surprise 
I bet if Fran Deck Sr (founder of Frans) were there he would be disappointed also, or at least tell them how to cook and manage the operation
Might be an idea for a Frans location"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on my birthday. Standard breakfast fare. I had French toast with a side of bacon. I have no complaints... I like my bacon really crisp, so I should have specified that as it was chewier than I would have liked. The waitress was friendly and attentive and I had my order in a reasonable time frame."}
{"text":"The first selling point for a restaurant for me is the staff.. N i was bowled over.. The staff is the friendliest i have seen in any restaurant till date.. Warm n helpful they take care of u very well.. Loved the famous 4 egg omelette Garden fresh vege and the chocolate chip waffle.. Totally satisfied after the strenuous driving test 
This place is definitely going on my regular's list"}
{"text":"Headed out for brunch with Angela over the weekend.  And to be honest, we didn't get to the restaurant till around 2pm... so not really brunch.  But nonetheless, who doesn't love sleeping in and eating brunch when you're actually awake right?  Though to the readers out there, when do you head out for weekend breakfast or brunch?  I'm curious.

Anywho, headed to Eggsmart that's located along Bay and Elm.  Eggsmart's been here for a while and on the weekends even at 2pm appear to be still bringing peeps who finally decided to wake up and meet up for \"brunch\". =P.  Nothing fancy with the decor, it's your typical diner that focuses on breakfast/brunch clientele.   It's a long restaurant and we were seated near the back.

Angela and I weren't really hungry but didn't wanna end up eating dinner late at night.  The waitress serving us was fast and efficient and wasted no time.  She was attentive throughout our whole meal and was quick to meet any of our needs, like a dropped fork. =P.  Angela ordered the Blueberry pancakes with a side of sausages and I ordered the Meat Lovers Scrambler.  The Meat Lovers Scrambler is essentially scrambled eggs with steak, chicken, bacon, cheese, onions and green pepper.  The wait wasn't too bad at around 10-15 minutes.  

Once the food arrived Angela as usually buttered up her pancakes and poured over a fair amount of maple syrup.  Gross I know right?  Or sugary heaven, I haven't really made up my mind.  The Meat Lovers Scrambler wasn't bad.  Pretty much what I expected, though if I'm back next time, I'm going for the sausage scrambler.  With the Meat Lovers, there wasn't a distinctive taste as it was lost in the wide variety of meats.  Both Angela and I liked the home fries and they weren't your typical deep fried taters.  It appeared to be the freshly cut, lightly seasoned and pan fried goodness that you can make at home.  The pancakes weren't bad, but nothing special. But the side order of sausage, they were overcooked and kinda dry.  Maybe it was getting near the end of breakfast.  Not very good at all.

Overall, Eggsmart isn't horrible.  It's your typical diner type breakfast joint.  Nothing really stood out and to me, this place is pretty much like Denny's.  Don't hate, but I prefer IHOP over Denny's ANYDAY SON!  So Eggsmart's isn't a horrible choice for the casual breakfast when you don't feel like cooking and it's close by.  You can hop over in your sweat pants or PJ's and no one will get upset.  I don't think I would head here as the sole focal point, but sometimes you just wanna eat in your sweatpants and hoodie and not be started at."}
{"text":"Uhm, yeah I'm addicted to this place now. Initially I wrote off these kinds of chain breakfast restaurants as garbage such as other those-that-shall-not-be-named chains but I was really impressed with Eggsmart. 

This place is located in a small plaza with a bunch of other weird shops. It is at the very tip at the end. We went here on a whim and I really wasn't expecting much, but I can confidently say that I recommend it for any traditional breakfast lovers. I always get the big breakfast which comes with a mass of food and pancakes for only $10 something which is amazing!!! And you know why some breakfast places are bad? The big tell is how they treat their eggs. Eggsmart's eggs are beautiful and tasty. The quality is quite good and yummy. 

Service is very good. I've gone here 3 times in the past two weeks and I'm hoping they recognize me as a regular soon!!! They are always attentive and greeting you and saying goodbye as well. 

Recommended for all yo' breakfast needs!!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located, is spacious, and has great staff. The food was phenomenal. The home fries are cooked to absolute perfection. I had the meat lovers omelette. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly and my order was customized. Staff had no problems with this. On a side note to the franchise (not this location).... Either buy a bigger glass or STOP charging nearly $5 for a small glass of juice. Jeez."}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise to find the Scarborough owners in Mississauga near the airport!  Great did with great prices, but the service is outstanding.   Need anything specialized...these guys well make it happen all with smile."}
{"text":"Even though this Eggsmart location isn't the closest to where we live, it is by far the one with the best service.  Great food with a great price served with the best customer service I've had in a long long while.  It's worth the extra 10 minute drive for us."}
{"text":"This place went from \"a-ok\" to \"avoid at all cost\". We live in the neighbourhood, so whenever we craved for some omelette, we always went to Eggsmart. Our experience today, however, has completely changed our attitude towards this place. NEVER EVER WOULD WE EVER GO BACK TO PLACE, EVER AGAIN.

We're seated by the window. I was about to put my bag on the ledge by the window when I spotted 2 dead flies. EWW. Made me wonder how often they actually clean this establishment. There were 2 servers on the floor, we're served by the shorter girl with dark hair who was very nice and polite. We've seen her around, been served by her several times, her level of customer service has always been consistent. So I ignored the 2 dead flies by my legs... in the name of customer service. We got our food, I got an omelette and my boyfriend got a plate of french toast with sausages. We're about 2/3 into our food when my boyfriend found a fruit fly on his french toast. EWWWW... We told our server, she apologized and offered my boyfriend another plate of french toast, he politely declined (...because obviously, would you still have an appetite after you found a bug on your food?!?), she apologized again and took his plate away. A few minutes later, our server and the other server (a taller girl with brunette hair) came by to our table to point out that it wasn't a fly on his french toast, it's a small piece of burnt crumb. WTH. The other server was very adamant about it, even brought a piece of toast with burnt crumbs to prove her point. Again, WTH?!? It's a friggin' fruit fly! Deal with it. At least our server was on our side. She showed the other server that it's indeed a fruit fly because it had wings. DUH?!? The other server looked extremely annoyed and let out a big sigh. REALLY LADY?!? She reluctantly offered my boyfriend a new plate of food. French Toast, pancakes, eggs, you name it. His answer was still NO... for obvious reasons.

When we paid, we didn't even get a discount on his food. Instead, we got a $3 off coupon for our next meal. BIG WHOOP! :( We're never going back to this place again. The taller server needs a lesson in customer service and this place needs to be turned upside down inside out for health and food safety.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST."}
{"text":"It was quite busy on a long weekend Saturday morning but we were seated quickly. The early bird special runs until 10 am for only $5.99, what a steal. I believe it's 3 eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon. The only minor issue was that I was given a bagel with cream cheese instead of Nutella. Once the waitress was informed she brought out the correct order. She was polite and friendly and the food didn't take long to come out."}
{"text":"Really a 1.5. Can't hate the place totally. Gal serving was nice but the experience was rough. I just needed a place to get some food as I had a late night yesterday and an early morning today. Thought about McD's drive thru but wanted more than a Mc-junk-something. 
Weak and bitter coffee ($2.25) and meh breakfast ($8.49). Taxes and gratuity about $14.00-QQF!  Sticky table, no charge. Probably should have had clown food - priceless!"}
{"text":"My previous review mentioned phantom reviews with 5 stars and people claiming that the place was the best.  It is good to see that the reviews have been black holed in the Yelp universe.

Shortly after my review was posted, the co-owner contacted me and asked me to give them another try and the meal would be on him.  That was 3 weeks ago.  I did not contact him nor accept any compensation as it would pollute the honesty and integrity of my reviews.

I was in Calgary again and this morning decided to give them a try again.

The same good service was given (I believe it was Irene) and I ordered the exact same meal - for comparison.  The eggs were supposed to be over-ez but they were almost over hard, and their solution to ensuring that the sausages were cooked through was to butterfly them.  Too bad the cooks have not figured how to cook the meat without having to hack them open.

Just before finishing my meal, I Yelp messaged the co-owner to thank him for his email and told him that I was at his restaurant and advised him that I do not take compensation of any kind.    I did however tell him that I will update my review based on today's experience.

If you happen to be in the area and need a fill up, the food is fine for that - btw, coffee is pretty good and not included in the breakfast special.  They seem to take more care with the food since my first trip there.  Again, service isn't a problem.

It's nice to see that Yelp reviews make a difference!

Cheers."}
{"text":"one of the best places i have been at for breakfast 
a little bit on the high side for price, but the service is unbeatable"}
{"text":"was very happy to come here for breakfast the other day, nothing like the bloor st location, but still a good outing to say the least. was very happy to get a decent meal for a really good price(minus the orange juice, im not a fan) the service is great, the location is clean, the food is made to order so its fresh and hot. great accessibility so far as transit goes, street parking is not an option, but there is a lot quite a minutes walk away. I would like to point out that this location is head over heels above in every aspect you can imagine, over its neighbor who won't be named. come in for a great meal and outstanding service! 
I wish they have a 24 hour option, that's my only complaint is the hours, otherwise an excellent breakfast experience."}
{"text":"This is really one of the worst dining experiences ever. The servers were pleasant. Almost. 

\"Steak Wrap with no green peppers\" is what my friend ordered and it came with the excuse \"Oh ya I forgot to write it down.\" It was honesty. Then they took twice as long with the correct order but it too had a few pieces of green pepper in it. And the steak pieces were without any fibre... some sort of rubberish looking gray matter. 

By the time I waited for the second rush order so that I could eat with my friend my food was now cold. But that's my fault. My food was fine overall and the \"3 eggs\" seemed a generous portion. The bacon was cold when it arrived. 

The coffee was fine - that's important. The orange juice made my friend wince because it was sour. Some people do like that. I've never heard of it being too sour before. 

But here's the real kicker for me. My friend took me there saying she had coupons. And the waitress said no luck - only on week days. She was so embarrassed and was a little hurt. She just gave me the coupons for myself having been humiliated over trying to save us a little money and she bought breakfast. I just read the coupons now and there isn't any indication on the coupons nor the website that says there is any condition on the coupon except to use by the end of the year. It seems like like it must have been a lie on instruction of the owner. Well, that's how it seems to me.

Because the meal was so shite the waitress comped the drinks for $6. I said nothing to her and tipped her nothing. I hope the place puts itself out of business as soon as possible. Ick."}
{"text":"Large breakfast, too pricey for my Asian family. But it was a joy to be here :) One plate definitely fills you up and prepare you for a big bright day. Cheaper than Cora's!

The Benedict is served on English muffins. Home cut fries are pretty good, not the best. Most dishes come with fruits and toast, or a salad. And lots of eggs. 

The Cubano Ciabatta (under Sandwiches & Wraps) is amazing: provolone, peameal bacon, sliced ham (THICK), pickle, tomato & lettuce with dijon bistro sauce served on a ciabatta bun. Comes with home fries, and this was surprisingly filling (keep in mind, I'm a small Asian girl).

The freshly squeezed orange juice is a must. Super sweet and sooooo fresh. I have it every time. You can order the 1L for $7.99.

Cora's is super busy, this place wasn't so. Maybe it was just my luck."}
{"text":"Tasty and Fast as expected. The scramble eggs are my favorites. It's definitely a good choice to go around 6:30 am."}
{"text":"Worst service over ever experienced........ 
ridiculous wait time 
20 minutes to get a coffee 
15 for food 
Has to send mine back and my partner was done before me....."}
{"text":"If only I could give no stars at all.

I frequent the Eggsmart at Woodbine and John, so when I go to an Eggsmart, I don't expect fancy food like Smash or Inspire. 

The food at this Eggsmart was terrible. 

I ordered a classic breakfast, that included 3 poached eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 4 slices of toast, a slice of orange and a slice of papaya. As the server came with the food, I could see from the bottom of the plate that 2 of the toasts were burnt, to the degree that it was completely black. When the server put the plate in front of me, everything looked fine, so I assumed she didn't know about the burnt toasts and I flipped the burnt ones for her to see. Even showing her the burnt toasts didn't elicit any reaction. She dropped 2 pouches of jam and asked if there's anything else I need, then she left. Aside from this, the fruit slices were paper thin, much smaller than the ones served at any other Eggsmart locations I have visited. 

I have never left an Eggsmart without a fully satisfied tummy until this. I am definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Food was a ok... eggs and homefries were cold.  Wife ordered brown toast and got rye... (she hates rye)... took 12 minutes to flag somone down.  No coffe refills... no service... when we complained they did take the wifes food off the bill... no manger came to discuss.  Id recommend seeking other breakfast option than here."}
