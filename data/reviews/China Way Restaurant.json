{"text":"This place has great food at a fair price. I usually get the beef and broccoli and they never disappoint. The owners are very friendly as well"}
{"text":"Guess the previous reviews about the changes were correct. I haven't been in the neighborhood for awhile so I was unaware of the change in ownership. I sort of wish I would have read them before coming although I probably would have tried it out anyways. Change can be a good thing but unfortunately I don't believe that is the case with China Way. 

I've eaten here since the nineties and while it was never 5star food in my opinion it was solid and well priced. I would have to say both of those qualities are gone. The food was your typical, in my case, Mongolian Onions with Chicken (Meaning a plate full of onions with a few pieces of scattered chicken) and the flavor wasn't anything worth driving any distance for. The prices have also gone up a few dollars and while I'm perfectly content to pay higher prices for excellent food this simply wasn't the case. 

I guess all good things do eventually come to an end. China Way is no longer one those little good food, good prices type places that we love to tell our friends about."}
{"text":"So I had this place on a whim, because it was close to my sisters place and one of my favorite restaurants had been across the street. Needless to say it wasn't that great, and I wish that the other place was still around.
I ordered Honey Garlic and Orange chicken, along with an order of Crab Angels and Pork Fried Rice for me and my Sister to share.
The chicken was just so, blah. It was the kind of battered chicken you could pick up from Walmart in the value bags and just re-heat in the fryer, which is my exact guess as to the preperation of these dishes. Was not good quality at all and I ended up throwing most of mine away. The sauces that they used however were really good and it left me wishing that they would have had better quality chicken and I probably would have finished it.
The Pork Fried Rice was also just ok. Was a little bit on the greasy side and didn't offer too much in the mixed in veggie department, but was do-able.
The Crab Angels were probably the best part, but it's hard to go wrong with those anywhere. It's basically cream cheese wrapped up and dropped in a fryer, with a side of bright red sweet and sour. No complaints on that part.
The service was very quick though and friendly so they have that going for them and the restaurant was very clean from the area that I saw. The price seemed reasonable, but since I threw some of the order away the dollars didn't go so far.
A pretty cool aspect of this restaurant though is that the building has a drive through window on one side, so if you were to order for pick up you could pull up to the window instead of getting out.
After reading some pretty good reviews I was really bummed about my first trip here but maybe I'll give them another try and test out something that isn't battered."}
{"text":"I've been going to China Way for over 20 years, it's unfortunate that it looks like there are new owners now.  The food is not nearly as good as it used to be.  I'm very saddened by this as China Way used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I won't be going back.  General Tso's chicken I'll miss you."}
{"text":"We have been eating at China Way for years. This time we ordered dinner for delivery. (Yes, they also deliver!) We ordered the lemon chicken with rice and the sweet and sour chicken with the chow mein noodles and it was delicious! They have really stepped it up in the quality of food, service and now they deliver. The delivery was very fast and the delivery driver was very courteous.Thank you China Way!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Had the chicken chow mien and was surprised just how much chicken came with it.  Very good.  Can't go wrong here for chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been going to China Way for the last few years and it was my goto place for chinese food it was awesome.

I went there shortly after the change and noticed the menu and my usual numbers were gone. Is it me or is most Chinese food seemingly ordered by numbers? After decoding the new menu, I ordered my usual for the family, Generals Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and the Chicken Dumplings. Got it home and noticed visually that the food looked different and smelled different too. Upon tasting it all, yep, not the same. The General Tso's chicken was more like a citrus/orange chicken, the Mongolian beef was bland and the dumplings were soggy and pale, not partially crisp like they used to be.

So last night 6/11/14 I decided to give them another shot since they are close to home and maybe they had a bad day or something, it happens. Well sadly the prior visit seemed to be the par that has been set.

Regretfully I will not be going back to China Way until they return the recipes that made them so good. If you read this China Way I hope you take this to heart and work to keep your loyal customers of many years."}
{"text":"My family used to love this place; it was our go-to fast food Chinese food place for many years, but tonight we went through the drive through and noticed the menu was different than usual. We adjusted our order, and when we got it home, we found that the food was VERY different than it had been in the past. I don't know if they got new cooks, new managers, a new owner or all three, but every single thing we ordered was mediocre at best. The chicken chow mein seriously tasted like they had opened a can of chicken noodle soup, drained the broth and heated it up. The noodles were mushy and bland and so far from what they used to have, I can not believe it is from the same establishment. The sweet and sour and orange chicken were 90% spongy tempura with little bits of tough meat in the center. 

After at least ten years of going here, it sadly seems we will have to look for a new Chinese food provider."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 7 years. It's good, not fancy, and perfect for \"comfort\" Chinese food."}
{"text":"Worst experience and I didn't even need to leave me home. Did delivery like I usually do. The food tasted like someone had already dumped a load of soy sauce on it. Then the delivery guy harassed my neighbor about a small faux jade figure he keeps outside his front door until my neighbor gave it to him. This is 100% not okay as I was then yelled at by said neighbor. Will never be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"First time from this place. Ordered delivery came pretty quick and food was still hot. Moves prices for the large portions I received and I am thankful they use decent Togo containers. My food tasted amazing and my opinion is I think I got the wrong soup but it was great. And I wish instead of soy sauce packets they would have sent Siracha packets but next time I'll ask."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey crisp chicken, noodles, fried rice & orange chicken. Everything was delicious! I'm always nervous to try new Chinese restaurants but I was very pleased with China Way! I must add, the young boy who was working the drive thru was very polite!"}
{"text":"Go to place for Chinese on a week night.   
Great fried wontons with crab and cream cheese, general tso chicken, and broccoli beef. 

Best part is a drive thru; though this is not pioneering for food, it is awesome for those that want to skip over the Panda Express thunder poops."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new place. .I chose China Way, I really really didn't enjoy the Beef with Broccoli. The veggies were overcooked and the\"beef\" was thin and mushy. I'm not sure what kind of beef it was. I never had mushy beef, also there was no taste to the entree. I also ordered beef fried rice and pork fried rice. Again, the beef was mushy and the pork was diced small and dry from being overcooked. I love Chinese food, but I didn't love it like this place."}
{"text":"Service fast and friendly. I had beef chow mein good flavor a little on the greasy side. Boyfriend had Mongolian beef he thought it was to salty but he's not a big fan of salt so I had some... it was super salty. The taro boba was delicious. So I will return for that, may try another dish but we will see."}
{"text":"Their honey crisp chicken is the best! Great service! And they do delivery too!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase:  China Way is OK. 

Mixed feelings on my orange chicken.  Hurray for all-white meat!  A+++ to China Way for serving me meat that I can easily identify after biting into it.  Not always a common thing with Chinese restaurants.  The sauce was bland though.  Not terrible, but not incredible.  Not even spicy.  Your non-Asian grandmother who complains about everything being spicy will love the orange chicken.

The Mongolian chicken actually impressed me, as it rivals the one served by my favorite Chinese restaurant over on the west side.  Good balance of chicken and onions.  Flavorful.  

The wor wonton soup was the best I've ever tasted, but China Way needs to learn how to pack soup better for take-out, as 1/4 of my soup ended up in the bag surrounding its styrofoam cup, even though we held it straight and carefully.

This was my first experience with China Way, and it was good enough to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to order Vegetable Fried Rice in Phoenix!  I love this place...would go everyday if I lived closer to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid spot for Chinese food. I like that I can get fried rice with no onions because onions are the scourge of the earth."}
{"text":"Grading scale:
0-3: Food Quality
0-2: Service Quaity

I was quickly greeted when I walked in and they were very friendly.

I asked if they had specific menu items because their menu was huge and I was starving. They knew what they had and didn't have RIGHT away with no hesitation at all!

I ordered the orange chicken and asked if I could get it super spicy. I also ordered the crab puffs.

I got home and saw that I never god my crab puffs so I was a bit upset about that.

The \"spicy orange chicken\" had its flavor spikes but there was nothing that resembled any kind of spice. Overall it was not what what I ordered and I didn't receive the other item.

it's hard to rate the crab puffs because I didn't get them but I was charged 5 bucks for them.

I didn't get a fortune cookie in the bag which is not necessary I guess but I have never gone to a Chinese takeout place where they have not provided one.

Food Quality: 1
Service Quality: 1"}
{"text":"Ordered food without egg or meat but didn't tell us the pad Thai had egg...they delivered our food fried rice was fine but pad thai still came with egg. Called them to notify them, basically blamed it on us and didn't offer to fix it. We just moved into the neighborhood and could have brought you a lot of service, won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Normally this is my go to place for Chinese. I've never had a problem with them they did once over charge my card 500.00 bucks and got that fixed. Went and got the orange chicken and chicken and broccoli. Very, very bland. No flavor. Maybe they just gave up."}
{"text":"As someone else mentioned, I got violently ill. And like her, there's no way to know for sure that it was this place, but this was the only place I ate out at."}
{"text":"Yum!  We just moved to the area and were looking for a new Chinese take out - and we found a great one.  Their General Tso's chicken is delicious, yummy egg rolls and the dumplings were really tasty.  We'll be going back again."}
{"text":"FYI - you shouldn't be burning incense in a restaurant!!!! 

I hadn't been here in a while I moved further SE. since I was in the area today. I thought woo hoo China Way here I come... Walked in. BAM! The stink of Burning incense. Seriously did I just walk into a head shop? You selling pipes and bongs in that glass counter, or what??
NOTHING gives me a migraine faster than smell of  some incense burning!! Just from the few minutes of being in there! Thanks for that!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, but brought my parents tonight and each of us loves our choices. Dad had combination fried rice with beef,chicken and shrimp. Mom had Cashew Chicken and I had Shrimp in Lobster Sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food Is delicious. we had the chicken chow mein, shrimp chow mein( big pieces of shrimp) and the crispy chicken which is spicy. Also the crab angels which are crab puffs. Yum!
This will now be my go to place. So glad I found it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had China way. Today I decided to go and I tried the honey crispy chicken and it was delicious! I am quite disappointed that they started serving chicken potstickers, pork are so much better."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I ordered the chicken lo mein, noodles were not good and the chicken was terrible. Chengdu Delight is way better. Unfortunately they were closed today.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and never disappointed. I hadn't been here for a while so when I stopped by I was surprised the food wasn't extremely salty. It was hot so watch out. Don't and won't be able to gobble your food down. I ordered my favorite which was shrimp with lobster sauce which was awesome. They have great lunch specials but only on a few selected dishes. Mine was full price. Place is clean and airy. Only weird thing was that when there is nobody at the counter to order the wait staff stand at the counter and watch the customers eat."}
{"text":"Found this place while driving home from work and loved the friendliness of the staff.  The food is better than most places in the Chandler /Mesa immediate area."}
{"text":"I thought I found the perfect chinese spot when I noticed they had a drive thru as I walked in. I ordered the general tso's tofu crispy with brown rice. They gave me a kids size meal for about $9 bucks and called it a large, if that wasn't bad enough I tasted pork, chicken and crab in a vegetarian meal. I'm a vegetarian but I wasn't always one. I've only been one for the past 11 years, before that I ate meat all the time. I know what meat tastes like and I don't appreciate getting it mixed in with my tofu vegeterian dish. I hope I don't get sick now since my body isn't used to breaking down meat anymore. I found myself trying to finish my dish but fighting with it since my girl got it for me and I didn't want to make her feel like she wasted her money. She only treated me cause I dont like trying out new chinese restaurants cause they usually are pretty bad in Arizona just like this one. So far the only good one I've found is Dragon Express over on Alma School. I must have spit out my food like 5 times while I was eating, basically everytime I tasted some type of meat. To top it all off I noticed a nice sized dead spider just hanging out next to the push here for water button on the soda machine and of course I was getting water. Horrible experience, never coming here again. I'm sticking to Dragon Express. Oh yeah my girl wasn't upset at me not liking my dish cause she didn't like hers either. She had the General Tso's chicken and said the sauce tasted like pure syrup. Worst general tso's ever. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best Chinese Food restaurants I have ever eaten at. The staff is always friendly, the food is always excellent tasting and the speed of service is outstanding. I have eaten here over the past 3 years and I still drive back to this restaurant even though I don't live in the neighborhood anymore."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurants in the east valley. I drive 13 miles round trip when I want chinese food and have no problem doing so."}
{"text":"Food was good. Went for the General Tso's chicken based on reviews. Well, it is not available as a lunch special. Adding an egg roll, crab puff and drink is $2.25 extra (not too bad). We spent $19 on lunch though. Not terribly inexpensive for counter service and food served on paper plates. Entree portion was generous and about twice as much as the lunch special portion.
Saw the $5.85 lunch specials (3 choices). This includes drink and is a good value I would imagine. Might try this if I decide to go back."}
{"text":"After seeing an overall Yelp rating of four stars, I got take out from China Way last night.  Now this is an interesting place!  Believe it or not, they have a drive-thru.  Yes, seriously - a drive-thru window!  Even though they have a website to order online and there are certainly many good pictures here to use the phone, I got out of my car and went inside.  You know how it is, the first time anywhere you always want to make sure it's clean.  This place is.  There's a counter to place your order and seating if you'd like to stay and eat - and the decor is such that you wouldn't mind.  I ordered \"The Platter\" appetizer, Black Pepper Steak, and Shrimp Chow Mein.  All of it had good flavor!  My chow mein had plenty of shrimp which for $8.95 was a pleasant surprise. My husband's pepper steak was also a surprise as it contained meat \"bits.\"  I'm not making this up but some pieces were half the size of a postage stamp with none larger than a full size stamp.  Nope, not kidding!  Despite my husband being a \"slab of meat man,\" he said it tasted good but would have preferred it as a side dish...along with a slab of meat.  All said, I'll go back.  \"Sides\" take time and creativity to prepare, but \"Slabs\" are quickly broiled.  Meat lovers consider yourselves warned B-)"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I go for the lunch specials. Teriyaki Fried Rice and Orange chicken! Yum 5.99 and it comes with a drink. I go there so often the two owners know me by name. Great local chinese food! They call themselves Chinese fast food, so don't expect all of the menu items of a nice sit down restaurant. The quality of the food is worthy of a sit down restaurant though. I would give them 6 stars if I could. I'm obsessed! :D"}
{"text":"Food was OK, menu shows items not meals total price 4 adults with drinks $ 47.13 will not return. ...."}

{"text":"Been going here for a long time.  Most recently the Honey Crisp Chicken was fantastic. I always get my local Egg Drop Soup fix here."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to get Chinese food. We always get it for pick up and you can even order it online for pick up. They give really great service too. I personally love the shrimp fried rice and crab angels. yum yum!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and wanted to give this place a try. I have a sensitivity to additives and MSG so Chinese food is always a gamble for me.
This place is great!  Very clean and inviting restaurant with super friendly, helpful people. We ordered our usual at every place we try; General Tso's chicken, egg drop soup, fried rice, and a mixed seafood and meat plate. The chicken was meaty and moist and the sauces were just right.  Sometimes they can be heavy but this is a great mix of spicy and savory. The egg drop was light and more like a vegetable soup with tofu. Different but delicious!
My only complaint would be that their fried rice was a bit gummy and didn't have any meat or veggies in it. No matter, we'll ask for it differently next time.
Great portion size and even left-overs heated nicely the next day.

We will return!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at China Way since I was in high school (that was 10 years ago and it has been consistently good. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. To look at the building, its not much but the family that runs it is super nice and the food is amazing. There is only one thing I order because it is so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else. The General Tsao's chicken combo with fried rice, egg roll, and crab puff. Everything included in this combo is excellent and they have probably the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had. To me, Chinese food doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Love this place, never had a problem with the food or service. Never heard any bad things about this restaurant. Great experiences"}
{"text":"It was pretty decent but fell short of the other reviews.  If you have had real Chinese food then this is OK."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Disappointed in the War Wonton soup. Too salty. The portions are ginormous."}
{"text":"Nice , kinda like fast food restaurant but 100 times better food , everything is freshly cooked so very tasty, soups, chowmein, and fried rice are delicious ! Lots of flavor  in all their dishes . Excellent place to come and enjoy healthy servings of Chinese food! self serve fountain sodas also with tea dispensers , also yummy boba drinks :D friendly service. Simply awesome!  My new favorite Chinese restaurant in Chandler Az."}
{"text":"Like other reviews says this Chinese Restaurant has a DRIVE THRU !! I've never seen a Chinese restaurant has it, haha! very interesting. Alright, we still decide to eat inside, because we are not familiar with their menu. I am so surprise this place is so clean and did not smell any oily .  I and my girlfriend took few minutes to decide which one we want. We order the large size black pepper chicken and beef chow mein. The black pepper chicken comes with rice and it tastes really good and a little spicy. The Chow mein is good too, it comes with lots beef and broccoli and tastes just prefect. I thought this place would be similar to Panda Express, however, now I think it is much better than Panda. After we finished our dinner, The owner gives us a menu, and said now they are doing delivery too. Next time I could order at home. Very happy with my meal, and I will come back again."}
{"text":"Okay, so let me give  my explainations for this low score while veryone else seems to think differently.

I am always up for trying new hole in the wall authentic places. I drove past and thought I saw something unique...A drive through chinese place? Hmm...that could be interesting. So I decided to pull up and take a peek at the menu. Okay, not bad for the options.

Then the first 3 choices I tried, they said they did not have any longer. Maybe they should update their menu. Then I decided on yet another few items. They said pull forward without a total. Hmm, okay, maybe they need to calculate it out by hand since they have not updated to computers yet...Finally, after waiting 10 mintues, someone came to the window gave me a total, took my payment then handed me my food and said \"Enjoy\".

When I got home, the food was not even hot. One dish was actually any good regardless, while the other was terrible. So I probably will not be going back any time soon. Good luck if you decide to go, but just know they might not have everything that you might want at first."}
{"text":"This place is wort a stop, we all need extra Chinese restaurants that serve quality food! They have big lunch combos and greeat dinner combos. Price is affordable as well and dinner is sharable. If you drive thru get the sauce on the side, it will keep the chicken crispy! Huge menu selection i love the garlic chicken and general tsao  chicken"}
{"text":"It's taken me 8 years to try China Way.  Looking back I see it as lost time.  What impressed me was the quantity of freshly cooked veggies and proteins served.  
i ordered take out Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, a dish I have come to love when I lived in NYC. Instead of making the sauce with egg whites, they used the whole egg which appeared like scrambled eggs in the sauce.  I do not like scrambled eggs.  The sauce was very tasty, the onions fresh and crunchy and a least a half pound of good sized shrimp sweet and fresh tasting, perfectly cooked!  Bright green, crunchy broccoli was in the dish as well as some mushroom slices.  The best dish was Mongolian Chicken with white and green onions, ordered extra spicy.  I couldn't believe the quantity of sliced chicken breast and the great and not too spicy sauce.  Truly a 5 star dish.  All the above came with 4 very large scoops of white rice.  Fresh crunchy fortune cookies ended the meal.  Eighteen dollars and change for more food than my wife and I could actually eat.  We plan to check out many of their menu options.  How can you beat quality fresh ingredients in large quantities?"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant and it's very nice I live right down the street from it and everytime I go is very nice and they have good food I recommend for anyone to go there and check them out and they are very nice people yes they are"}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood behind the restaurant about 6 months ago. I have gotten food from there more than anywhere else. It is fast and easy and the food is delicious. My favorite is the pork fried rice!"}
{"text":"Seriously my fav place. It has A Drive Thru which makes it 5 stars! 
Love the chicken fried rice and garlic chicken.  Love the owner too. Everything I've tried I've liked. And love that they added a white meat chicken menu. 
This place isn't fancy, it's just pure awesome.  I can't wait until they open today!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like eating here. From the time you order to the time you are eating, only minutes pass. I think I've spent more time in line at Walgreens. Their food is very tasty too. We normally get the Sesame Chicken and crab puffs, also one other entree but that one always varies.

Price is fair too."}
{"text":"Solid and consistently great food!

I've been to this place numerous times over the last 6 years and recently moved back in the neighborhood and I wasn't let down. Consistently good food and a great price. Really can't go wrong here at all.

I always got to go... inside is all tile and not super comfortable but again.. you're getting quick Chinese food at a good price - ambiance isn't their thing. 

Oh they also have a drive-through == awesome."}
{"text":"So glad I stayed close to home and skipped Panda Express. General Tso chicken made with sll yummy white meat. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Their food was pretty delicious and they were friendly. One of the great things is that they have a drive thru!! There's times when I'd rather not get off."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to China Way since 1996 and they had the best Chinese food around in Chandler and we tried them all. Their prices have always been very fair and their food has always been consistent and good. Unfortunately, that changed recently  with new owners. My favorite has always been General Tso's which has always been wonderful. Tonight,that all changed. The Chicken was cooked different and without much flavor. This was the 2nd time this happened,and it won't be a 3rd time. I wish the new owners good luck,but sometimes,you have to stick to the original recipes or you will lose old loyal customers. Also,just a note,please get rid of the Curry dishes,it is not needed in my humble opinion.. Sorry,wished I could have liked the changes."}
{"text":"We got to the drive thru at what ended up being the exact time that they closed. We didn't know about this, especially because they still took our order. But then we quickly found out when all of the kitchen came out and gave us really ugly looks as though he purposefully held them up and they were about to leave for the night. The good thing is we still got our food, and it was fresh! I think the best part about this place is that there is a drive thru. The food does seem to have a lot of MSG in it and I was bloated from the excess of sodium, but the fried rice was super delicious! I would probably go back"}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch,dinner etc.. Sesame chicken was delicious. Staff is always friendly.  Good sized portions! To top it off they have a drive thru and delivery!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in Chandler! The price is great and they give such BIG portions (especially for dinner). The staff is always so nice and friendly too. Love this place and won't stop going to it. I recommend the Mongolian Beef and Crab Angels!"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT. I go there all the time, it is my fav! The service is good and same as the food. It's a must try"}
{"text":"This place has been here for over 22 years so they must be doing something right. This is a great hole in the wall Chinese restaurant that is not 'genuine' Chinese food but Americanized Chinese food done right. 

Your old standbys are here as are all of the old familiar items you have come to memorize on Chinese menus. Super cheap, I recommend if you like spice then tell them to make any of your dishes 'extra spicy.' Not the most amazing Chinese food but perfectly adequate and you're not going to spend an arm and a leg if you find you don't like the place. Another similar restaurant in the area is Wang's Delight."}
{"text":"Nice employees and food is always fresh and cooked to order! I love coming here if I'm in the mood for Chinese but don't want to go to a sit down restaurant because they have a drive thru"}
{"text":"Get the black pepper chicken with white meat!!!  This is the best dish at the restaurant.  I eat there for lunch almost everyday rotating between the specials.  mostly i'll get the BPC or the orange chicken.  By far the best restaurant in the area for the money."}
{"text":"Stopped at China way based on the rave reviews.  I ordered the Beef with Broccoli, which was ok.  There was nothing bad about it.  It just didn't wow me like the food at Chop and Wok does.  Overall a decent meal.  The restaurant was clean and the staff polite."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to quick Chinese restaurant.  They deliver and have a drive through window for pickup orders.  The food is always good and we have yet to complain.  The curry chicken and Singapore noodles are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Always good food! I enjoy eating here! Had a  good and affordable meal with my family! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a recurring visitor. The first time I tried their food was at a graduation party and a birthday party nearby. I was really impressed by their fried rice and orange chicken, just wish there was more vegetables in the fried rice. However, I've got to say that their egg rolls have a fantastic flavor and I recommend it to anyone who visits. So far I've tried the black pepper chicken and one kind of their shrimp and beef (when I find out I'll edit my review, I can't remember at the moment) and was satisfied. Just wish their dishes would use a little less sauce. I must warn anyone reading this that their dishes are served scolding hot. As I was hoping, last year they introduced boba smoothies! The only flavor they don't have is green tea. I've tried taro, strawberry, and Thai tea. I think their Thai tea could be sweeter than that, but hey, that's just me."}
{"text":"We got dinner delivered tonight from China Way. It arrived within 30 minutes after they gave us a 45 minute wait time which is great! They were friendly and attentive when we called an placed order. We got orange chicken, sesame chicken and lomein. All was delicious and the servings were big. We will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered orange chicken and kung pao chicken for pick up. The service was quick, which was fabulous, but the food was extremely bland. Kung pao had a little kick to it, but was mostly bell peppers as opposed to chicken. Orange chicken was like a subpar Panda Express had made it. Not what I expect from an authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been owned by the same man for 23 years now and I have consistently bought food almost once a week for the last 16 years.  One of my chinese friends said the style resembles to what you get in HongKong. The same guy with the same smile on the drive thru window (ofcourse he says \"Hey buddy , long time no see\" even he had seen me the week before) , good portions of food, drive thru and well cooked food..what else can we ask for.. 
Only complaint, egg in egg friends rice has reduced the last couple years.. But other than that, we love the place. Try it.. you will like it.. Ask him to make it spicy which tastes better than adding the hot oil."}
{"text":"The best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Egg rolls and crab puffs are delish.   All white meat chicken dishes I've tried have been great.  They are  now serving egg foo young which my husband loves.  Fast and very friendly service!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried rice in town!! #76.  I've been coming to China Way for years.  Yes, it's located in a strip mall, yes it's small, and yes it may not look like a \"fancy\" place to find great chinese food.  Give China Way a chance and you won't regret it. You can expect great, affordable lunch specials, and friendly staff.  By far the chicken fried rice is the best.  It's well balanced in flavor and has a good mix of vegetables, eggs, scallions, and chicken."}
{"text":"I love the General Tso's Chicken.  It is a bit pricey, but hey...you've got to fork up the cash to get a good satisifying meal!"}
{"text":"Got dinner for the three of us at their drive thru. All three of us now have very upset stomachs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food spot, it is family owned and run. Try the crab angels, spring rolls, House chicken and General Tao's chicken and Egg Drop soup. They have a drive thru and offer delivery. Both are fast and food is ALWAYS fresh."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I ordered the teriyaki bowl which is the best I've had in a while (no gristle pieces). 

My husband ordered the Thai sweet and spicy chicken and loved it and observed the cook working hard in the back! 

This may be our new go-to Chinese takeout spot!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious!!! Crave it all the time and taste authentic! I recommend the crispy chicken and ya won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Delivery time on a Friday was reasonable. About an hour. Driver was courteous. Food portions were large and more than anticipated   Food quality and taste was great. 

Food quality: 5 stars
Delivery time: 4 stars
Service: 5 stars
Driver: 5 stars
Price: 5+ stars
Overall experience: Delightful. Would recommend the orange chicken and beef fried rice"}
{"text":"Used to be great. New owners and new recipes YUCK! The orange chicken tastes like honey chicken. They use WAY too much sauce on everything. Food tastes like prepackaged, microwaved food!

Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is my Go-To jam for Chinese food in a hurry. These guys have a drive thru and it rocks out.

Love their Three Kings Delight Rice Bowl. It has chicken, beef and shrimp along with lots of vegetables and fresh jalapeños. Super-tasty!

Their smoothies are the slammo; I recommend the Coconut, Taro and Mango. Also recommended are the Crab Angels and Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"Food was hot which was nice. To me, nothing to write home about. I do typically prefer the chicken to be a bit more crispy. A bit expensive for what you get though to me. $11+ for a sesame chicken combo."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Food isn't horrible. But tastes nothing like the description on the menu. My \"tangy, spicy\" shrimp dish was overly sweet with no spice whatsoever. Boyfriend's General Tsao's Chicken tasted like Teriyaki Chicken. Spring roll, egg roll, and Crab Angels were good. Would not order from there again."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I've had better Chinese food. My husband loves their black pepper chicken. This most recent time my husband ordered the spicy chicken, my son the shrimp fried rice and I ordered the general tao's chicken. My husband really liked the spicy chicken. I thought it could have been hotter, considering its name. My son loved the shrimp fried rice. I thought it was pretty good too and they weren't stingy on the shrimp, definitely a plus. The general tao's was a little too sweet and really dry."}
{"text":"First time, place is good, service is friendly, restaurant is clean.

Honey garlic chicken was great and the portions are large.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, it was the only consistently good takeout in the area and as others have said it was our go-to Chinese place.  Unfortunately about a month or so ago that changed along with their entire menu.  The items we ordered were our usual selection but not one thing was cooked with the recipe we are used to.  That wouldn't be a problem if it were a better or equal recipe, but everything we ordered seemed to be cheaper quality food with lackluster preparation.  Everything was kind of bland, soggy, and gross.  I am really sad to be writing this but we won't be going back unless they go back to their original style which i doubt will happen.  :("}
{"text":"This place has become a cult favorite here at my dealership.  It went from daring each other to try it to eating here twice a week for some of us.  The lunch specials here give you the most bang for the buck, and the food is pretty good too.

There's a lot of items to choose from here depending on your tastes so I recomend checking the menu on their website.  Since this is my lunch destination, I usually rotate thru the lunch specials which come with huge portions.  If your looking for something on the cheap, then try one of the three $5.85 specials which include a drink.  

If your into cheap decent chinese food, give it a try.  Super friendly customer service from this family owned and run restruant."}
{"text":"I came here on whim as it was after 8, I had a sleeping toddler in the backseat and I noticed they had a drive thru. I got the teriyaki chicken with vegetables and an eggroll. All were perfectly delicious. The chicken was spicy and full of vegetables. The portion was large enough for two to split and served with plenty of steamed rice.  The eggroll was typical. Nothing special or new. But it was delicious and NOT overly greasy. My family has been back twice since discovering it 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"Loved it! Reasonable price and large portions too!
Got the Thai sweet spicy chicken and it was delicious. Got the managers special with a crab puff and egg roll.
Husband and I both ordered plates and came out to about $25."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the one star review.  The food was so disappointing.  Everything was pre-made.  The potstickers were tasteless.  The noodles in the lo main tasted like over cooked spaghetti noodles.  $50 down the drain!"}
{"text":"China Way was my absolute favorite...and I grew up in the Chinese food industry just outside of NYC so I am picky. Sadly, I had not been by for a number of months and went back last week for my usual: house fried rice with extra shrimp, crab angels, wonton soup, and whatever else my husband wants. We also got lemon chicken. Drove through and took it home and was VERY disappointed. Realized there had been a major change and contemplated calling the restaurant to find out if the cook had called in sick. Checked out yelp and found out I'm not the only one dismayed by the changes. The chicken dishes were dry and hard...nearly choked my chiweenie (dog) to death. Wonton soup was cloudy/pasty. We hardly ate any of the food and threw the leftovers away. I'm in mourning."}
{"text":"I'm a new customer and dont know how the food before. I was skeptic seeing the other review about the flavor has changed but I just try it anyway. I ordered the new menu, honey crisp chicken and I love it! Old customer should try this one instead of complaining about the change. One thing that is constant is \"change\""}
{"text":"Best egg rolls EVER!!  Food is always fresh, STEAMING hot and the service is always friendly!  We sometimes go here just to get a bunch of egg rolls and some egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been pretty disappointed with the Chinese food around Chandler, and I don't think we have ridiculously high standards. Hot food hot, cold food cold, the description and/or picture kinda resemble what is served, ok atmosphere. That's it, pretty basic.

This was the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my entire life. The fried rice was brown-stained regular rice with one lonely corn kernel on top. The orange chicken was itsy-bitsy tiny pieces of chicken with a TON of overcooked batter smothering it. My \"chicken\" was unverifiable poultry... it was all fatty and gristly. It was disgusting. We won't go there again.

They get two stars because the employees were very friendly. Maybe we went on a bad night?"}
{"text":"This place is really a cut above the rest. To begin with, they have a drive thru for your to-go orders...brilliant. They always seem to be in a good mood, the menu isn't over priced, and the food is fantastic. Just good, clean Chinese food. You can tell they keep their kitchen clean and that the food is prepared fresh just by the way everything tastes.  Try the China Way Chicken for a little something different. China Way rules!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise. I've driven by this place everyday on my way to work for so long. Finally went for dinner. It's very clean inside the restaurant and the bathrooms so extra kudos there. 
The menu is large and something for everyone and priced well."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the people at the drive through were very nice. The drive through service was crazy fast too at around 1:00PM. 

I ordered shrimp chow mein and the crab angels. The chow mein is a little more saucy than I usually like it, but there was a lot of shrimp in there for the cost. The crab angels aren't anything special, they're cream cheese won tons with a teenie tiny bit of crab in there and cheddar cheese shreds that melt - kind of weird actually. I spent $14.27 and got a huge portion of the shrimp chow mein, the crab angels, and a container of steamed rice I didn't order, but I assume came with the chow mein.

I probably won't be back because there are a lot of other places in town to try, but there wasn't anything bad about my experience here."}
{"text":"Our family's go to take out place!!! There's a drive thru  everything is delicious and the people are so welcoming and friendly! Crab angels, egg drop soup, shrimp lo mein, shrimp friend rice, crispy honey chicken, beef and broccoli are a few of our favorites"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, just havent had time for a review. First off I L O V E that they have a drive thru, it makes it easy for me to call in an order and pick up during my busy lunch hour. Lunch specials are great and you get alot of food for your money. I usually get the chicken chow mein or the orange chicken. both are delicious. The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well,  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls, not this place :) Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well. I have no complaints thats why I have been going here since 2007 and will continue to go."}
{"text":"I was a little scared to try this place due to the recent Yelp reviews. However, I was very pleasantly surprised when I finally decided to give it a try. The place was REALLY clean and spotless, which is a BIG plus for me. They don't have the food ready, only cook it when I ordered, but it still came out quickly and piping hot. The people working there were all very nice and speak English well (which is not the case in some places). The food taste pretty good and very reasonable priced (I spend less than $10 for my meal).

Almost all of the recent negative reviews are about how there was a new owner recently and everything changes. I have never tried China Way under the old owner, but from my experience today, maybe the changes were for the better! Seriously, some people just can't handle changes! Don't be afraid to try this place, it is very clean, quick, tasty, and reasonably priced! What else can you ask for???"}
{"text":"After the gym, we head to China Way to grab steamed chicken and veggies from the healthy menu. Drive-Thru is amazing! Hands down the best Chinese food I've had in AZ."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how amazing this food is...I love the sesame general tso and sweet n sour chicken....Will be back for sure..my wife doesn't like Chinese food usually but will eat here.   Good hospitality and when you buy chicken it isn't mostly breading like most places we go."}
{"text":"love this place! they're fast, food is always consistently tasty. their general tsao chicken is the best!!"}
