{"text":"The staff/manager here is just fantastic. Went for dinner on a Sunday evening and ordered a couple of drinks and some food. A bit after our drinks arrived the manager stops by the table and says that the chit with our food order was missed by the kitchen, apologized for the delay, and stated that they would be taking care of the bill for our food. To be honest we didn't even realize that it was taking long and said as much to the manager. The manager was surprised and pleased that it was our server that caught the slightly longer wait time than usual rather than us. The food was very yummy and once the bill came they really did take care of the food for us and gave us two $5 off coupons for next time. I was floored as this was my first time here, and I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Browns for being so awesome!"}

{"text":"I ordered fries and gravy to go with my $10 off bottle of wine (Saturday special) and was so happy with them I did my first yelp review.   First of all the fries were good. But the gravy. The gravy was delicious. And the fry to gravy ratio was great. I almost ordered more fries to not waste the gravy that was left over.   #fatandhappy #check"}
