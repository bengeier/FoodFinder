{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight. The minimalistically-described \"house salad\" was a very pleasant surprise. Arugula, quinoa, crisped sweet potatoes, poached pears ... okay, that's more than enough of a description for a salad. Suffice to say it was quite good.  :)

My wife had whitefish and I had steak. So we lack imagination ... bah! Both were excellent. The restaurant wasn't packed but there was a good vibe nonetheless. Looking forward to returning and trying some of the other offerings!"}
{"text":"The concierge at the Westin reccomended this restaurant and he certainly did his homework. It's a small establishment on Wellington, but the food was amazing. I had a pappardelle with a venison ragout, excellent. The vension was incredibly succulent. The Red Bibb salad was superb. A perfect blend of sweet and salty with pear and hazelnuts to complement and nice, light vinagerette. My wife had the pan roasted chicken and enjoyed thoroughly. I was disappointed with the chocolate tart. The crust was tough, probably have been frozen, a small letdown to an excellent meal. 

My only disappointment was the limited draft selection. The wine list was excellent, but I prefer a beer sometimes and was disappointed with the three choices, all bottles. 

Service was excellent although the woman attending us went a little over the top with the sophisticated patter. It just didn't come off as sincere. The owner, however seemed genuinely interested and made the night memorable."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend on Saturday night. The restaurant was busy and we didn't think that there was a space for us. But they found us a spot at the back. It was nice because there was a big group at the front.

The server check with us many times and their suggested wines went well with our meal. My boyfriend and I shared several small dishes including scallopes, tempura shrimp and warm olieves.

For our mains, my boyfriend opted for a vegitarian pasta. And I had a pasta of the day. The service was very prompt. And food was really fantastic. 

We kind of ate a lot by this time, but I couldn't resist to have a dessert all to myself, so I had cream brulee. He had chocolate tart (which I also tried, yay!!).

In the future, I might like to try coming here for drinks at the bar since the interior has a really nice vibe."}
{"text":"We went there for a group dinner and it was a disaster. They charged me for water, they brought out oysters without being asked and then charged everyone $7 a person. When a friend who asked for a vegetarian choice was brought meat and let the waiter know, he received attitude. And finally, when checking our credit card bill against the receipt we signed,  they didn't match. Two of us had our bill split equally between two credit cards. They had issues claiming them, so instead they went back and put two charges (incorrect charges) onto my friends credit card.
The food was good, but the service was awful. This place is not prepared to deal with the public yet - stay closed and work out the kinks!"}
