{"text":"The marinated meats here are amazing. Along with the beans, rice, salsa, and guacamole. My family has been coming here for years and I only came on Yelp today to see when the store opens and I was shocked to see only three reviews?! This is clearly one of the best kept secrets on this side of town because this food is the real deal. I buy the meat, grill it, and serve it with all the fixing they make in house. They also sell really great small street taco sized tortillas. Definitely try this place out for your next Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get some good Carne Asada? Look no further because this place has great selection of meats. Went here to pick some up because my wife had a craving, the staff was friendly, not pushy and helpful. The store isn't large but that doesn't affect the quality of service you get here and the choices you will have. Highly suggest if you are looking to through a little fiesta!"}
{"text":"Yep yep yep. Great great great tortillas and rice and beans!!! Great marinade too! Come on down and enter Mexico here."}
{"text":"It's a very small store with a good selection of Mexican basics.  They have a wide variety of key items, and everything seems to be fresh.  Service is pretty efficient and there's never a line to check out."}
{"text":"So...I was craving some carne asada tacos like nobodies business, and decided to stop by here (close to work) to get some goods so I could make some at home.  I went with a 2/3lb piece of carne asada, some flour tortillas and a thing of pico de gallo.  Total was just over $11.00.    The carne asada was BOMB!  I had the guy marinate it for me, and let it sit in the fridge at work for a few hours.  By the time I got home, it was all nice and cozy sitting in the marinade!  I threw it on the grill for a few minutes, and it cooked up perfect.  I chopped it up into pieces and made my tacos.  Great carne asada!  Some of, if not, THE best carne asada I have ever purchased from a Mexican grocery.   $8.99 a lb and worth every cent!  The pico de gallo was as fresh as can be, and reasonably priced, too.  Lastly, the tortillas......  They had an 18 pack of street taco sized flour tortillas for just over $2.00.  You could tell by just looking at them they were going to be great.  I threw them on the grill for a minute and they charred up perfect and tasted absolutely delicious!  Chewy and hot and full of flavor!   The meat man and cashier were friendly.  I will definitely be back, much sooner than later!  This shit was bomb!"}
