{"text":"I was craving some tacos and decided to give this place a try.  I got a Mexican coke and ordered carne asada because I did not know what the other choices were.  I had the expectation for real Mexican tacos but it was just ehhhh.   It is a cute place but there was something missing.  Maybe I was expected something else.  My meat was chewy and the taste was nothing special.   Will keep looking for good tacos."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here in two weeks. Tacos are bomb!Carne Asada is tender and has lots of flavor! I would visit this place everyday! Love it! Love it! Love it!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh, these tacos were so good I wanted to go hug the cat that was making them after I was done, wow.  Pollo was an 8, carne was a 9 but the brisket tacos were a 15!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Michael Reyes = Excellent Food
When I'm visiting the Downtown Phoenix area, that's my spot for excellent tacos, drinks and hospitality! You must try!!!"}
{"text":"It's the wonderful return of Micheal Reyes, who was a community and food guru. The food as expected, great. Micheal puts his heart and soul into his food and his restaurant and it shows. In the crowded field of  taco shops its surprising this is the only true downtown experience to be had. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place so many times thinking that I really need to give it a try. I finally stopped in and El Centro Cocina did not disappoint! 

This is not your typical sit down restaurant, it is a taco stand set up under the front patio of Bar Smith. The menu is on a sandwich board just outside of the patio, where you place your order before entering the establishment. They'll call you by name when your order is ready and you can take it to go or take a seat inside Bar Smith to eat. 

This was my first go around and the woman who took my order was so friendly and helpful, explaining the process and offering up taco suggestions. She advised that we were welcome to wait inside the bar to get out of the sun while waiting for our order. The taco meat is visibly cooked fresh, which you can see as you walk thru the patio to the establishment. 

I ordered two brisket tacos ($2 each!!!), and waited about 5 min for my order. The service was excellent, the tacos were amazing, and they have a new repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Outstanding tacos. They are stationed in front of Bar Smith. You order your stuff outside and can sit in the bar area, but it's not exactly a full-on restaurant. 
Luckily, I happened to stop by on \"Taco Tuesday\" and they were 2 bucks apiece. But the price was irrelevant...these are seriously excellent. I got the pork/green chile, carne asada, and cactus. All were expertly crafted and had all the right flavors. I would have ordered a few more if time allowed. 
Just go here. Trust me."}
{"text":"Cheap tacos. Had every taco on the menu besides the carnitas, which was sold out, and was very pleased. Service was friendly and fast. Will become a staple of my weekly lunch spots."}
{"text":"Straight up A1 tacos! Have come here a couple times already and the chef of this awesome menu was super friendly and introduced himself and a bit of information about the place. The food was amazing and presented great! It seemed all fresh and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"The tacos are hellla good and $3 a piece so you won't break the bank. I'd recommend the carne asada and the pork belly. Try a Jamaica or horchata too, they are homemade. Yum!"}
{"text":"We went here after a long day at the convention center and we got exactly what we wanted: great drinks and really great Mexican food. We had the Mexican Street corn and it was DIVINE. The guac is also really a gift to the avocado lovers in the world. 10/10 recommend the apps. All of them."}
{"text":"Delicious food and such a friendly bunch! Had the smoked pork and smoked brisket. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went around the block twice looking for this restaurant but was unable to find it and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"My friend Diane suggested that we lunch here. I loved it! I ordered the Horchata as my drink and was so excited that it is made onsite. It exceeded my expectations - delicious!!! The Carne Asada tacos were amazing too! Very flavorful and just the right amount of each ingredient. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love these tacos!

The corizo is one of my favorite tacos, but you really can't go wrong with any of their selections. Thursdays are Sonoran hot dog day, and these a huge! Any place that serves pork belly will have a special place in my heart. So, I love this place."}
