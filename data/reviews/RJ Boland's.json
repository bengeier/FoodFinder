{"text":"The happy hour here is a good deal with all drafts for $2. The kitchen however is a nightmare. Waited over 45 mins for a vegetable pizza. After asking the server several times where our food was we were told it was coming out of the oven each time. When it arrived we were served a cold pizza with unmelted cheese and the only vegetables on the veggie pizza were mushrooms and onions. We made it known that we were not happy with the food and were just told there was a new cook and received no food comp. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of those high-end sports bar, with dark wood, dark lighting and TV's at every booth. The larger booths even have 2 TVs. I guess if your intention is to eat dinner while watching TV it's nice or if you have to go to dinner with people you don't have anything to say to you can avoid awkward silent pauses in your conversation (or lack thereof). The menu is standard but there are two stand-outs - Italian wedding soup and Sweet Potato french fries!"}
{"text":"I would recommend giving RJ Bolands a few weeks/months to work the kinks out.  They still don't know how to function effectively as a restaurant/bar.  Prior to an evening at the HOB, I suggested that we try RJ Bolands for drinks/dinner.  We had quite possibly the worst server that I've ever had.  Aside from being rude, slow and brash, he even told us, \"You guys suck\" when we asked about separate checks.  That wasn't exactly what I was looking for when I recommended we try out the new place.    What makes me not give this place a 1 star - like it deserves, is that when I told the manager about our issue with the server, he could not have had better customer service with us.  I will try this place again, and may update my rating.  For now - I'll stick with my current assessment of the establishment."}
{"text":"OK, I have to up my rating to maintain my good Yelp karma. I went back for lunch today, and the menu was expanded and contained more appealing options. My spinach-strawberry-goat cheese salad was not the first one of its kind in town, but it was solid. My colleagues had a meat loaf special and a Buffalo chicken sandwich, which they enjoyed.  Service was also improved. I had a better experience today. I would still be leery of happy hour, though, after such a thoroughly unpleasant experience last month."}
