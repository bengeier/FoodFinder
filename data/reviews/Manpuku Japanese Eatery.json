{"text":"Overrated place. Raman is average. 
Strongly don't recommend their yakionigiri.
I'd rather they give me 1 piece and put more pork floss inside instead of 2 pieces with almost no meat floss."}
{"text":"My home away from home!

Super friendly staff! 
Delicious food at a great price! 

Salami curry don is a must try!

It gets very busy during lunch hours on a weekday, make sure you get there as early as you can. 

Takoyaki is a must try but please remember it will take about 20 minutes for an order."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff (especially the owner) are all so friendly and accommodating.  They work hard and smile while they're at it. As a Japanese Canadian it is hard to find good Japanese food (especially cooked by Japanese people) in Toronto.  This place is one of a handful. Their menu is quite extensive, but cute and easy to read with a photo for every item.

I usually order their Salad Udon (amazing!) and Nikujyaga. Both are flavourful and good value at their prices.  The soborodon is also a safe bet as is their hayashi rice.

There is a combo option when you order udon or donburi (in very small print) on their menu that allows you to order two of either soup, salad, or takosen (takoyaki on a japanese rice cracker) for only 2$ extra! The takosen is good but it takes a while to make so be patient."}
{"text":"Tastes like a typical instant noodle
They should have more various kinds of ramen. 
Service is really good tho.
Very impressed with waitress serving people. Restaurant is like real Japanese."}
{"text":"Manupuku might be hard to find at first as it's located in a corner of the food court in Village by the Grange. When entering the eatery, you'll notice that the place itself is quite small but it definitely gives you that authentic Japanese feel. 
I came here to try the Curry Udon and I found it to be mediocre - it wasn't bad, or was it great. The soup base was refreshing but the udon noodles were from packages and not made fresh as I hoped.... The portions are also small for big eaters but the food is inexpensive so you can always order more and try different dishes. I recommend the tako-sen - a creamy octopus ball smushed between 2 thin crackers *drool. All food is cooked so no sushi here."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. A bit on the smaller side but priced well. Order a few things and share with friends."}
{"text":"A small Japanese cafe.  Service was good/friendly but they did forget a part of the order, so we had to wait extra.  Doesn't seem like that's a frequent problem though.  The food was very good and relatively inexpensive.  Recommended."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese noodle house in Toronto. Period.

My husband and I have been going here for over a year now, and it is hands down one of our favourite places. We go once a week. Our go-to dish is the Nikku Udon. I get the pork, my husband gets the beef. The udon noodles are always cooked perfectly. The soup is sooooo good. And I love the red seasoning that they give you; adds a great touch of heat to each bite. We have been tempted to try other dishes, but each time, we just can't do it! So I am a little biased when it comes to this particular dish.

Tip: 
- once you're done the noodles, you'll wish you had more. I always go for the noodle refill. Only $1.10 extra!
- if you are sensitive to gluten, you can substitute with sweet potato noodles instead. I did last week and they were a great alternative (a little gummy in texture). $1.99 extra. 

Check out my longer review on my blog: http://fabulouslyaverage.com/?s=manpuku&submit=Search"}
{"text":"There was a vast selection of dishes at this restaurant. The food was amazing and very flavourful. The price was average for the dishes. The quality of the food beats the quantity for sure. I highly recommend the japanese curry dish and takoyaki which had a lot of squid inside. 
However, the location closes too early on mon-wed and the service was average as there are not enough staffs and is very busy. As well, when we went at 9pm, they sold out of beef and chicken which was disappointing so be sure to go earlier if you want the whole menu. 
I would highly recommend this japanese restaurant as the food is quite authentic and the flavours are strong."}
{"text":"Cheap eats! Located in the food court right beside ocad, very affordable for students. Order the curry udon and takoyaki, it was good!"}
{"text":"Came to this store because of how great the reviews are on here. Ordered a beef rice bowl. Came really quickly together with the 5 spices powder. Tastes first spoon, beef were sorted like the shredded type. Short in length and thin, but good taste. Also has onion in them. The rice is quite watery at the bottom of the bowl. Im asian and i love Japanese food. I ordered this expecting a guydon type of beef bowl but is quite different. But I like it, is comfort, simple, like home cooked food. The price is really affordable too! Cheaper than my mini size pulled pork poutine @ poutini. This store is located near a food court of a small mall. So i guess you could expect the price to be similar of the food court pricing. The staff there are all Japanese and we all know they are the friendliest! They look pretty hot too! Hehe. 

Overall, this is a very good place to experience simple comfort food from the Japanese culture, unfortunately the ice cream mochi was out of stock but i ordered the pudding for dessert instead and it taste very sweet lol which is odd for japanese as they dont like food too sweet. Quite smooth and creamy which is good! Not something outstanding but since they dont have mochi is good alternative to finish off the meal. This is also a place very good for solo eater as they have bar tables and even tables for one person! This place is large enough to fit 30-40 people. 

If you are tired with western bars, come to this, they serve japanese beers!"}
{"text":"The place is a little bit hot, they just have fans for ventilation:(. 
The udon is fantastic, especially with the soup which is rich of beef favour but light. Howeve the tsubugaiyaki has too much flour, hardly taste the favour of calm.
Slow service but great prices ;)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for cheap udon. Tasty beef with onions with good portions and flavour balance. Pleasant and efficient service"}
{"text":"Not strictly J-food in the \"expected\" sense by perhaps the mainstream - there's no SUSHI, or CALIFORNIA ROLLS, or BENTO-BOX, or TERIYAKI TEISHOKU here.  Nope.  What they DO are a mish-mash of delicious comfort type and street food, done the way one might prepare it at home (some with a twist!) and that's just fine by me.  I grew up on home J-cooking and as I don't live anywhere close to home anymore, sampling fare from Manpuku amongst friendly people makes it easy to part with the pittance that they ask for.  

The staff are friendly and very approachable.  It is very rarely NOT busy during the usual prime times so you know that means this is a gem of a place to the initiated."}
{"text":"Honestly, I might be more in love with the concept of Manpuku than the food itself, though that's not to say that the food isn't pretty damn tasty.  The idea of a cozy restaurant serving home cooked comfort food devoid of the tempura, sushi pizzas, and teriyaki that comprise most of the Japanese eateries of Toronto is indescribably refreshing.

Most of the dishes are simply made with simple ingredients that nevertheless fill a deep void left by my mom's cooking.  For a nominal fee, you can order the bare-bones version of the udon or curry, though I always found that the upgrades are well worth the price.  The takoyaki is made from scratch (with an imported machine, no less!) and while the batter to octopus ratio is a bit high, it still gets the job done."}
{"text":"Definitely is a hidden gem in Toronto. Awesome food and efficient service. Highly recommend curry udon."}
{"text":"Love this place! A couple of friends and I stumbled upon this place after reading some reviews on yelp. Really good place for some authentic japanese street food. The prices are pretty reasonable. Came here a couple times in the summer and there was no a/c. It was really hot but was worth it for the food LOL. 
Will definitely come back again. Gotta have the mochi ice cream while you're there!"}
{"text":"Huge portion of eel, love that it's served with sea weed. The udon is simple but delicious (very on par with something you'd find in Tokyo) and sooo cheap. The green tea cheesecake is disappointing. Instead of dessert just get another meat or ramen dish tbh. Very casual simple dining space but with service and everything."}
{"text":"Niku udon + noodle refill

I don't need to say anything else"}
{"text":"Since I go to OCAD, I frequent this place pretty often. I usually get the kake udon (which is the cheapest udon dish and comes with just four pieces of fish cake) for just over $4 or the beef niku udon for a couple dollars more. The soup is addictive and the dish is simple and filling. You can make any dish into a combo for another $2 and have a choice of two out of three items: takosen, soup, or salad. (They say they also have chips available on the menu but every time I've asked they don't have it so I've given up.) Takosen are a good pick for combos as you get two takoyaki (a popular Japanese snack made of batter balls with a piece of octopus inside) sandwiched between two rice crackers. 
This place is such a great deal and the food is amazing for the price. I'm not Japanese so I can't say how authentic the food is but it certainly feels healthier to eat here than some of the other places in the Grange. Also, it's nice to have a proper sit-down restaurant with non-disposable chopsticks and clean tables. I have booked the place for large groups before (10+ ppl). The hours are sometimes a bit odd as some days they close later than others and they usually open at 11:30 am (and sometimes they are late to open) but booking solves the problem if there is one. Also, even though it's Japanese, don't expect sushi here. The main pull is udon."}
{"text":"Nothing like a warm bowl of noodles on a cold, wet day! Located in the Grange food court is Manpuku, a small sit-down restaurant serving up cheap and delicious bowls of udon.

I ordered the Curry Udon - basic plain udon topped with a Japanese blend of beef curry sauce ($5.99). I was expecting the broth to be a lot thicker from the curry but it was still a pretty light soup base with a mild curry flavour. Very enjoyable! The slices of beef were tender and the green onion garnish was the perfect addition to the dish.

There's an option to make any of the udons or donburi's a combo for $2 which comes with a choice of two sides including chips, salad, soup or Takosen. I went with the soup (miso) and Takosen. The Takosen was basically a takoyaki sandwiched between two Japanese rice crackers. I didn't like the rice crackers very much, which I found to be a bit stale (but I'm not sure if they're supposed to be this way). As for the takoyaki themselves were delicious! And hot, so you might want to let them cool a bit before popping them in your mouth.

My boyfriend ordered the Niku Udon - basic plain udon topped with pork and onions in a special blend of sauce ($5.99). The pork was nice and I really enjoyed the broth, which wasn't too salty. If you find yourself still hungry after a bowl of noodles, you can get a noodle refill for $1.10.

Since I was starving while ordering, we also ordered the Yakionigiri - traditional rice ball stuffed with tuna and grilled in soy sauce ($3.49). I've never had this before but it was surprisingly delicious. I loved the crispiness of the exterior from being grilled. There wasn't actually much tuna on the inside (which I believe was canned tuna), but I didn't mind. This would make for a nice little snack. 

Overall, I really enjoyed Manpuku. The food was cheap, quick and delicious and the service was friendly. A great spot for those craving a warm bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE Japanese noodles and rice place in town. A true hidden gem. 

For one, their food is amazing, authentically cooked with good ingredients. Takoyaki is really good. 

Plus, their service is great. The staff are friendly and genuine, you can see they don't just want to make money, they want to provide customers with a good experience. 

They really go above and beyond. I.e. When I go to pick up orders, they will ask if I want have some hot tea (cold outside) while I wait. While when I go to other restaurants to pick up food, you sometime get the sense that the staff feel you are taking up floor space... 

Overall, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food.  GREAT prices! Not certain I'll be back.
DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY!  Can't imagine what the kitchen looks like.   Air vent covered in a thick layer of dust, table and chairs were sticky.  Waitress put chopsticks and spoon directly on table, which looks like it was purchased at a garage sale.
Hot and stifling in the restaurant, and this isn't summer any more.  Little air circulation despite two portable fans.
So good food BUT..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The workers are adorable and the food is great! I highly recommend the Niku Udon (beef). I got almost all my friends to try it, and they're hooked.
I go often, after classes or even just on random days, because I live so close by."}
{"text":"I have been going to Manpuku for about 3 years now and one of many things that stand out is the consistency of the food as well as the service. They have also accommodated my many special requests. I can brag that I've learnt a little Japanese as a result of my commitment to their menu! Thank you Manpuku for great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for japanese curry udon and that's all i've ever order from there. (thought i did get a combo once for an additional $2, the salad was decent and the octopus balls were alright... very breading-y)

Service is great and I appreciate that it's authentically japanese.

It's worth the money u spend and it's very filling too!"}
{"text":"Love this place for it's unique Japanese food/ snacks and value, not too impressed with how many of the menu items are sold out. Everything on the menu is around $4-8 which is amazing. I always order couple dishes to share amongst friends. The location is kind of hidden, it is inside the Grange food court just right across from OCAD.

Some of my recommended dishes are  takoyaki, tofu nugget, Takosen, fish cake, ice mochi. If you are still hungry, opt to try one of their udons. 

Do come here before rush hour as there is ALWAYS a wait. As well, if you are ordering takoyaki, the wait for that is usually around 20 mins."}
{"text":"I go to OCADU so i constanly grab i bite to eat here. It is my absolute favourite place to eat. It is cheap and delicious. My favorite is their plain udon, the broth is the best i have ever had. Their takoyaki and onigiri are also great"}
{"text":"A very unassuming restaurant that provides excellent bang for your buck.  The curry don was pretty authentic and tasted almost as good as it does in Japan.  The udon had good flavor and was light.  Overall a great experience and I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Service was really friendly and fast. But I ordered the scallop and egg on rice (hotate don) and wish I ordered something else. The sauce and mayo made it good, but honestly I only tasted scrambled egg. I flipped the egg around and could not find any scallops? Maybe it was ground scallop mixed in with the egg I don't know. I suppose scallops don't have a distinct taste to begin with. So for $8.99, I felt kind of ripped off."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here once but decided to go for Kinton Ramen nearby instead, but I really wish I stuck with Manpuku now that I've had my first experience with them today.

The place was practically empty and we were greeted instantly. The menu is small and straightforward and being an avid fan of both curry and udon, I went for the Curry Udon with beef while my friend had the Niku Udon.

We basically got our food almost 5-10 minutes later. My first impression of my soup when I took a sip was not good. I tried my friend's and it was stupidly amazing. However, being the scrub that I am, I realized I had to mix the bowl up and then try the soup, which of course, gave me an extremely better result. Unfortunately, I have a horrifically small stomach so after munching only 25% of the bowl, I couldn't go any further, so let that be a warning for all you light-eaters.

We also tried tried their onigiri which was stuffed with rice and barely any tuna and I do love my tuna :|

The service was very quick, and our waitress was not like, 'friendly' but very attentive and kept refilling our waters. Yay for water.

Overall, for 2 of their more expensive udon bowls + onigiri was equal to about $17. Definately coming back again."}
{"text":"It has its own style but still young for a good Japanese restaurant. The food choices are not the typical that you would find in a regular Japanese restaurant which is a good thing. However, it is obvious that the ingredients and the different sauces are just plain and simples of these you can find them really common and cheap in grocery stores. It does not live to the standard that Japanese food should have in my mind: Fresh, Seasonal, and made to order. I ordered some beef rice with egg and the rice was just barely warm enough. Little or close to no sauce in the rice but green onions were abundant. I originally went for the famous squid balls but ended up they sold out near the end of the day which I find it unpleasant. The price was not set to the standard of food and service that I have received."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Village by the Grange. Don't expect anything fancy but if you're looking for something simple for a good price, you can't really beat this place. 

I ordered the niku udon and the nakionigiri. I loved the udon and the broth was very crisp and clear. I'm not a big fan of nakionigir in general but I thought the ones they served there were decent enough. Next time I go, I will definitely be trying the natto dishes (I think they are one of the few places that serves it)."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places whenever i'm nearby and want to grab a quick snack throughout the day .

I love the takosen here, its good for a snack since the portion is small. I have tried several udon dishes and they are good for the price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a little hard to find if you've never been (it's in the grange food court), but once I finally caught on, it's often my 1st choice for a quick and casual dinner in the area. Lots of diversity on the kind of confusing menu, and really excellent prices with good quality - we need more places like this in the city. The hotate (scallop and egg) on rice is my favourite, and the takoyaki and simple salad are also a nice treat. The servers are efficient but always super gracious, patient and nice. A good place for peanut/tree nut allergy sufferers as I'm pretty sure there are few or no items containing nuts. However they are always very careful when I ask and will get a staff member who speaks better English if necessary. Oh, and they have Sapporo!"}
{"text":"Love love love love.  First time here, so figured I'd try their staple dish.  Beef Udon.  This was superb.  The beef was tender and falls apart in the soup which makes every spoonful chockful of beefy goodness.  

It also drove me to write my first Yelp review - which shouldn't be taken lightly.

Try the Ramune drink.  It's a mix of cream soda and sprite.  The bottle is sealed using a lodged marble that you have to jam through to open.  Go ahead and order one.  Life's too short."}
{"text":"This is a good for a cheap meal.  Don't bring your date here.

Food is average.

Get the Kake Udon and add $2 to make it a combo (choice of 2 sides from salad, 3 pieces of takoyaki or takosen, chips or soup).  $6 total and will make you full."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Best udon and takoyaki in Toronto! ??????! Staff speak Japanese fluently. Highly recommend for a home style Japanese experience!"}
{"text":"I came back for their special calorie-free noodle. Was it worth the 2$? No. It didn't taste special. And I am not a dietitian, but I am pretty sure the only calorie-free item on this planet is water.

Also, the salami curry is odd as hell. I don't have a pic (camera was in the office) but just a heads up: it barely has curry taste. The ketchup and mayo completely overpowered the dish. The salami was too salty. Yuck."}
{"text":"I want to love Manpuku.  Japanese operated and affordable I am always hoping to get a taste of Tokyo fast food here, but it usually disappoints cause the food is just meh.

Not to be avoided but you can do better."}
{"text":"Went there for something sweet, but they don't have cake, so I ordered mochi instead. Chocolate mochi with green tea powder on top. Average."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favourite places to go and eat. It's delicious and affordable, and the staff are always friendly. I just wish it has a uptown location as well"}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese comfort food. Hayashi rice and takoyaki are my favourite. Super affordable for a student budget."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over a year now and I still love it just as much!
The menu is small but if you are a fan of Japanese food you'll want to order just about everything! 
My Favourite is the Niku Udon! UHMM a deep beef flavour broth with thin slices of beef! The udon have chewy bite to them. I get this with the Ramune and ask for a side of Takosen.
Takosen is like takoyaki taken to a crispy shrimp cracker level!
Takoyaki comes in 6 pieces and they are small dough balls that have a piece of octopus inside and drizzled with a mayo/takoyaki sauce. Takosen is when it is sandwiched between two pieces of shrimp crackers!

This place is quite small which is the only thing I don't like about it.

The takoyaki and takosen take a longer time to make (probably because it is homemade) but it is my FAVOURITE place to go for some good ol' dough fried octopus balls! 

The location is pretty convenient for students that go to OCAD and for people who commute because it is on Dundas street and near china town and eaton centre!"}
{"text":"Came here after finding out we had a 30-40 minute wait at our first choice for dinner, which was a Thai restaurant. This place reminds me of a small restaurant in Tokyo -where I went on vacation. 2 of us ordered $40 of dishes and we loved the chicken ramen, cold udon and green tea ice mochi the best. The Japanese beef curry with rice, octopus balls and vegetable soup were average to me. Overall, the prices per dish were reasonable, had some favourite dishes and loved the atmosphere - a place to eat for a lot of Japanese students! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was afraid I was going to miss this place, but it's easy to spot (the building it's located in is anyway). It's located inside the Grange Food Court. There's a McDonalds inside the building, so if you're in the area and you see one, it's probably the right place. 

The restaurant itself is a little further to the back (or the side, depending on which entrance you use). It's closest to the entrance across from OCAD that says \"Annex\". 

I ordered Takoyaki here. They said it'd take 20 minutes to prepare. They make it fresh, and even though I was kind of in a rush, I was fine with it. 

The takoyaki itself was good. Largely batter, about 20-25% octopus pieces, drizzled with mayo and tonkatsu sauce, and topped with bonito flakes. I'm not sure if mine was perfectly made (it wasn't completely round), but it tasted great nonetheless.

I can't comment on their noodle dishes, but I'll definitely be back again for some more takoyaki, so maybe I'll try some then. But if you're craving some takoyaki and you don't want to wait for Guu to open or to wait in their lines, this place is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This is feel good food right hurr. I can come here when I miss Japan and be comforted by udon, onigiri and nattou. And I can eat without worrying grease and sodium. That's comforting too.

This is a very tucked away joint but your life will feel more fulfilled when you find it. Atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but food wins no questions asked. So authentic, so affordable and so delicious. Try their Tsukimi udon (best!) and try their Hotate don (scallop don) - it's almost like an okonomi yaki on rice.

Atmosphere - 3/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 5/5
Price 5/5"}
{"text":"Food is nice, Best Takoyaki and udo noodles around, but beef with rice is a let down. Service is ok but can be improved. Hey Japanese people, you need to smile! It is a deli so I do not expect much. I would give 5 stars for a deli but 4 for a restaurant"}
{"text":"the niku udon is the best choice if you want authentic japanese. another very good dish is the unagi don. i dont know whats with these other reviews by these brain dead zombies. Complaining about the meat when the cooking time is short and the cut of the meat is thin so what do they expect. I have been to tokyo so I know what japanese food tastes like and compared to probably half the people on this website can cook. There are certain dishes that are better than the rest and their desserts are pretty outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice lie-key atmosphere, genuinely good service. Traveling in Toronto almost a week and this is on the list of best finds."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on Yelp, was in the and craving some comfort Asian soup noodles so we decided to give this restaurant a try.  It is a small restaurant but the waitresses / waiters are quick and  attentive so I imagine the turnaround for tables is short.  I think we were in and out within 45 minutes.  

The menu is simple and the dishes very well priced.  I ordered the basic seasoned seaweed udon while my boyfriend ordered the Niku udon (with beef and onions in special sauce).  Taste wise, the udon was clean and simple.  It was nothing amazing but that's the beauty of it.  It is a comfort food.  

We ordered the Takoyaki as well.  Make sure you order it early because it is made from scratch from point of order so it takes at least 20 minutes.  It's definitely different and worth trying. The different flavours and textures do fuse together quite well."}
{"text":"It's a place that portals you to contemporary Japan. Hearty, cheap food and very friendly people. Why no sushi? \"Toronto: no ocean.\" Sidney is genius and his team is remarkable. My favourite dish is the pork curry don. I've introduced many friends to this place. So raise your glass of green tea or Sapporo to mighty mustached samurai warriors everywhere, kampai and domo arigato!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is the price. Almost everything if not everything is less than $10. With that being said, the food (at least the udon) is tasteless, even with the addition of a lot of chili powder. 

I mean, it's filling, sure. And at least it's not fast food."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. Cheap eats! Great atmosphere and clean, too. Informed us beforehand our Takoyaki would take 20 minutes to see if we are okay with it. The udon is al dente, which I love. Takoyaki had a smidge too much dough for my liking but for the price, I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Business has been booming for our friends at Manpuku, but can it be that their popularity has given way to slightly lackluster-leaning food? Most notably, their takoyaki (which requires patrons to wait \"at least 20 minutes\" for, even on a weekday) has the \"balls\" to be served SANS octopus. Every single otherwise flavourful, but much more mushy morsel, was missing it's star ingredient: the ball of octopi (?) that should have been snuggled within.

And the response upon payment? \"Oh... sorry.\" And yes, they charged us. Lucky for you, Manpuku, you've won me over before, and I have faith you can redeem yourself."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time when I'm in the city! 

Great takoyaki & udon! As well as the curry rice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, most of the time for lunch and usually do take out as there is such a long wait during lunch time. Friday night, had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, not that bad. It was my friend's first time so I made sure she had to try my favs - Beef curry don and takoyaki. We also got the ochazuke.

Our eyes were bigger than our stomach. There was so much rice to eat between the 2 of us. We couldn't finish so we doggy bag the rest of the rice. The curry was as tasty as always. The takoyaki ... hmm, I think last time I had it, there was more pieces of octopus and the dough was not as soggy. The ochazuke - rice in tea broth, there was a lot of rice than I thought! The service was quick and good as always."}
{"text":"Food was okay. You get what you pay for. I wanted to try one of their udon dishes but when we entered the place it was so warm we were sweating (it was summer). We ended up ordering the Negitama Gyudon and the Shigure Don, very similar except for the egg on the Gyudon. Our total was $18 with a can of coke. Pretty cheap meal, but would not go out of my way to eat there again. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Oh Manpuku, where have you been throughout my university life?

Manpuku gets it down right as an eatery. Easy on the wallet, generous portions and an upbeat atmosphere with friendly service.

The menu moves away from the sushi, bento box and noodles that are common in Toronto's Japanese restaurant scene.

However, not so many veg-friendly choices, but then again Japanese cuisine was never super generous to vegetarians and the definition of vegetarian in Japan includes the consumption of fish. I'm pretty sure soup is made from fish stock. But a little compromise never hurts.

Manpuku definitely is one eatery that I'd return to for food that I love.


Vegetarians be warned: Ochazuke, although labeled as veg-friendly, does contain chunks of fish. It's still delicious though.

Large groups of 5+ be warned: it's a small place and like Tokyo, space is a premium and limited."}
{"text":"I love that you can get a decent meal here for about $10. It's tucked in a corner of the Village on the Grange, across from OCAD and a quick walk from St. Patrick subway station.

The udon is good - the noodles are a good texture and the soup broth is delicious! I wasn't impressed with the takoyaki balls - they were mushy and not nearly as good as the ones I've had in Vancouver and Japan. 

That said - the location is convenient for when I'm downtown so I'll be back! The \"balcony\" part of the restaurant seats about 16-20 people so if you call ahead that area can be reserved for a party but there is very little privacy."}
{"text":"Curry Udon!!!!! 
That's all. 

Tried their takoyaki too but not really worth the 20 min wait if you are there for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great, authentic food. Tremendous value, excellent service. Fast no frills dining centered around great food."}
{"text":"I really like the environment and the menu. I ordered Ochazuke and it was actually pretty BAD. It was two chunks of rice in broth. It was extremely salty and the rice tasted as if it was fried in burnt oil. I felt quite bad after eating so much grease and I didn't even finish half of it.

But I feel like the other stuff in their menu seemed better.. Will go back again to try some more stuff and update my review."}
{"text":"What a find this place is.  Very straight forward menu but enough variety to keep all satisfied. 
I had the Hotate Rice for $8.99. Delicious and filled me right up. 
Polite staff and great food. 
An all round great place to stop for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants in Toronto that I go back to again and again...and Manpuku is definitely one of them.  Their take on home-style Japanese food is delicious!  If it's your first time their you have to try their curry udon or rice.  My favourite dish is their salami curry - it's their signature curry sauce on a bed of rice, topped with pan-fried salami, ketchup, mayo and scallions - it sounds like a really weird combination, but trust me, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Proof that the best food does not have to be pricey.

THE FOOD
The yakionigiri is something I will never forget for the rest of my life. The niku udon and kake udon were also all very good.

THE ATMOSPHERE
In the food court of the Design school. Hip and hectic.

THE SERVICE
Very courteous, friendly and efficient...especially as busy as they were."}
{"text":"Noodles were pretty good and fairly priced. For a small eatery in a food court style shopping arcade, the food was surprisingly authentic. This isn't quite your run-of-the-mill Japanese noodles.

Also had the octopus balls, a first for me. They  were quite mushy (I'm not sure if they're supposed to be this mushy), but tasty nonetheless. 

The highlight, though, was truly the black sesame ice cream. Wow - I've never had it before, and it's extremely delicious. I would go back again and again for the black sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"Go for the takoyaki balls with the rice crackers (that works as a tidy takoyaki sandwich) and the one without rice crackers. 

Otherwise, they have decent cheap udon with seaweed. The udon was a bit too overdone but it's fine for the price. There's no air-conditioning and it's located in the back of Village by the Grange (which by the way has some of the best cheap-eats in town). I went there on a weekday for a 1pm lunch with about 6 coworkers and we were seated without a hitch because it was after the lunch rush. 

The takoyaki competes with those at Kenzo Ramen. The ones at Manpuku are smaller and it's the only place I've seen with the nifty rice crackers."}
{"text":"Prices quite decent, value for the money excellent, customer service alright, and quality of food quite decent.

For a bowl of Japanese noodle soup, paying around $4 seemed like quite the decent deal. The quality of the food was quite decent as well, being very tasty, and the right temperature. The only gripe I had with their food was where my friend shared some of the spinach he ordered on the side, which was way over-salted.

In terms of customer service, I found that it took them a while to acknowledge new customers. I think this is most likely due to the fact that they have a bar set up in a way that can have people block the staff's view of the front door when people are sitting in a certain part of the bar, as was the case when I arrived. When I was able to get the staff's attention, they were rather helpful and attentive, providing service with a smile.

All-in-all, I do see me returning to this venue when in the area. I only wish their mobile site was actually able to display their menu for me on their \"menu page\" on my phone :-/"}
{"text":"This place is hidden inside the village by the grange foodcourt, we almost couldn't find it!
We arrived late on Friday night, and the food court was closed. This little restaurant was in the corner, still bustling with business. 
The place was very cozy and homey. They are probably a family-run business, and the patrons were mostly students. 
We ordered the wasabi octopus and fried tofu for starters -- these were both very good! The wasabi octopus was a bit sweet  and had a kick! The fried tofu was nice and crispy, with peas inside. 
We also got the natto curry and tsukimi udon. I'd never had natto (fermented beans) before, but i've always been curious since japanese cartoons usually show them as these sticky beans that kids hate.. Well, it's definitely an acquired taste.. and i have yet to acquire them. It was very strong, but mixed with the curry rice, it was okay for me. The broth of the tsukimi udon was a bit bland for me, but i think it's meant to be that way. The udon were thick and chewy.. really good!

Overall, i'd definitely come back to try more stuff. I like that it's in a tiny little hidden spot and the service was good! Can't wait to come and try more things!"}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 6.5/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 8/10

Though I am somebody who puts a lot of weight onto the \"atmosphere\" portion of my ratings, I am giving Manpuku 4 stars simply because it is amazing bang for buck.

Hidden in a little food court near the AGO, my friend and I were promptly seated. We both had the kake udon, and I added a onigiri on the side as well. 

The udon came out quickly, and hot. Though there was no protein in the udon, we were stuffed by the end. I wasn't even able to finish my onigiri. 

The bill came in under $5 for my friend, and under $10 for myself. Almost unbelievable, especially after getting used to paying $10+ for lunch in the financial district/liberty village in my past couple jobs. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: amazing bang for buck, and good food."}
{"text":"I attended a part time study in OCAD , and it's really good to have a quick dinner at this place. 
I love the place as it's has a little essence of Japanese style. :)
and then, the servers are all very friendly, polite and nice. 

I ordered a bowl of beef of rice, very tasty,  with lots of juice there. :)
I could finish the whole bowl of it, very yummy!! 

If I ever go to downtown again, will definitely visit one more time."}
{"text":"Venue: It is a cute hidden restaurant in the Village by the Grange across the street from OCAD University. It has a warm home like décor.

Service: The staff is super friendly and accommodating! Once you walk through those doors every staff member welcomes you with warmth and make sure you are seated comfortably or taken care of. They check up on you to make sure you are doing okay. When you leave they all say bye. And did I mention they do this all with good intentions and a friendly smile?

Pricing: It is very affordable

Quality: The food is amazingly delicious! I have tried many items off the menu and have been beyond satisfied with each one of them. It is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Not bad experience,  small and tidy restaurant,  interrior looks veru authentic traditional japanese dinning room. Food sizes are a bit small but their prices are fair enough. Traditional menu provided some options are very japanese style like natto udon,  simple japanese curry udon, and fried egg with eel ronburi...also provide special drinks imported from jp too, both soft drinks & alcohol packed in their fridge. 
Food taste is just good,  but you can taste more atmosphere there. Is worth to come back for other dishes!"}
{"text":"Manpuku is a cute little place in a really ugly food court full of good food. (Does that make sense?) 

Anyway, I go to school across the street so I always come here for lunch. It's very delicious for the price you pay (which is very cheap, mind you). They have udon, rice, and other Japanese dishes. A lot of people like their takoyaki. It looks yummy but too bad I don't like seafood. 

Personally, I am not the biggest fan of udon. However, I really like their rice dishes. I think I got the shigure don (Thinly sliced beef on rice) and it was the best thing I ever had. Like an explosion in my mouth. 

Yeah."}
{"text":"Nice little spot tucked away in Village by the Grange. Relatively simple menu is done very well. The yakionigiri was a nice appetizer, similar to arancini, and it came out fresh and very hot. Also had the Niku Udon which was udon topped with beef, very simple dish but everything was very well made and the portion size was quite large. Great spot for a quick, cheap bite - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Unagi don 7/10, was big but dry and lack of unagi sauce or it was just not cooked that tasty as TokyoGrill but price affortable, overall was good. 
Egg Pudding 9/10! Not too sweet not too heavy, tastes just like ones in tokyo ^^ portion is big."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of takoyaki, this is the place to be. For other food items, it is not the best and there is better within walking distance. It's mostly a takeout place, and the staff is somewhat rude, but that's expected.

The takoyaki is brilliantly prepared and orders are usually ready in under 15 minutes. The batter is always soft, and the amount of octopus is generous. 

As for the other items, they are just okay. The noodles are often overcooked, but for a meal for under $10, it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"Always come here for a bowl of hearty udon! Their curry beef is quite flavourful and comes in a broth with onions and potatoes. Price is really great, and for only $1.10 you can get a refill of noodles!"}
{"text":"The price point is great for this small restaurant! I ordered the curry don combo and a set of takoyaki. It came to just under 15 dollars which is really good for downtown Toronto especially because the quantity filled me right up.

The curry don had a bit too much sauce but the flavours were good. The takoyaki breading reminded me of the traditional Japanese ones but the octopus was almost non existent. 

Overall I suggest you come here for a quick cheap bite, but make sure you account for the wait!"}
{"text":"Ill be quick.

The best ramen chicken soup I have tried in Toronto outside of Japan.

{"text":"Manpuku=cheap+comfort food
4/5 food    
5/5price  
4/5service

I would never think of manpuku when I want to treat myself a nice meal. However, I would come here if I am just looking for a quick and cheap meal(quick as in it wont take long to decide what to order). For the price point everything on the menu is great, always well executed. Their food reminds me of the comfort foods mom would cook at home, nothing fancy, but good and satisfying. There are so much elaborate(overpriced) food in Toronto sometimes I forget how to appreciate simple honest food like these. Manpuku is certainly providing some quality food for the students and the (starving)artists in this area.

Wait time here is terrible during meal times, especially lunch hours. But the wait staffs are always friendly and attentive. I love the snack size items on the menu, I can have more than one dish and not getting too full. 

I would recommend Manpuku, but don't come here expecting mind blowing food, take it as if you are coming home for dinner after a long trip."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I eat my takeout scallops & egg rice bowl...$8.99 for this bowl is reasonable, but I can't say it really stands out or anything. 

It's basically an omlette with small pieces of scallop, with sesame seeds, green onions, bonito flakes, and Kewpie mayo drizzled on top.  It tastes like an omlette on rice.  Eh, not sure else to say about it. 

I've heard that the \"it\" item is the takoyaki.  At $4.99 for 6, it's actually one of the higher priced items on the menu considering there are udons at $4-5 and rice bowls for $9.  The takoyaki is made-to-order, so unfortunately I wasn't able to stick around the 20 minute waiting time for it that day.  Ahh well, there's always next time?

That said, I'd come back again if it's to serve as a simple takeout or quick lunch type of function.   The minimalist, food-courty kind of atmosphere isn't one where I long to hang out for too long.  There's just nothing that stands out for me in particular about this place."}
{"text":"Coworker took me here for lunch. One word. Well two. F-IN DELICIOUS!!!! authentic japanese cuisine so none of that california rolls stuff. And bonus: super cheap!!!! Had the takoyaki (octopus balls) to share ($4.99) and the Yakitori Don (grilled chicken skewers, egg, seaweed, rice) ($10.99). They were both sooo good. The takoyaki is off the chain. Taking my bf here soon!"}
{"text":"I love Manpukuuuu! Although it isn't the fanciest restaurant, the prices and service can't be beat. I usually order the kake udon and takoyaki if I eat at the restaurant (the takoyaki may take a little longer). Or if i'm on the run I grab a quick onigiri to go. They have little snacks and cool ramune drinks as well."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight, and it was mehh.  Food was OK, but at a great price and decent size portions (guess they have to cater to the students).  We had the beef rice, the scallop and egg rice, takoyaki and the rice in tea - all decent but not memorable.  They didn't have any of the Japanese beers they had on display, except for Sapporo which is nothing special and offered everywhere anyway.  Our server was very nice about it though.

Our dinner experience overall was not the most comfortable because it's very small and cramped, kind of dirty inside, and most of all - it's extremely hot!!  There is zero ventilation, and it's the middle of August!!!! 

If I don't feel like spending much and it's winter, I would consider coming back for a quick fix.  Def would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"There are lots of options at the Village by the Grange food court, but Manpuku and Gallery Sushi are the only two sit-down restaurants of which I am aware.  From the outside it looks like the seating area in Manpuku is tiny, but when we entered we discovered an upper level with more tables.  

The menu is mostly in Japanese, or English renditions of Japanese, and not very descriptive.  Luckily, they provide pictures of the food, so you can take an educated guess at what you're ordering.  The waitress was also very happy to answer our 457 questions about the food options so that we could decide what to order.

My rice with beef was larger and more filling than expected, especially for the low low price (around $5).  For slightly more you can make your meal a combo and add a couple of appetizers.  A few people at my table ordered the Takosen - something I had never heard of before my experience at Manpuku - with their meals.  (As described in other reviews, Takosen is Takoyaki served between two shrimp rice crackers.)  The waitress warned us that it would take a while (this just means it wouldn't be served instantly) because it was made fresh once ordered.  It was well worth the wait!  I dare you to try it!

If you're adventurous and like good value for your dollar, Manpuku is a great place to dine."}
{"text":"I became their regular just because their price is very affordable and the quantity is more than enough. Manpuku is operated by Japanese and the servers and cooks are Japanese too, so I do not question about the authenticity of the food :) I LOVE THEIR TAKOYAKI!!"}
{"text":"For the price, hands down best Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto for comfort food....comparable to what you'd find in Japan. Five stars for this price point; am full to the brim and it was only $15 each. Their desserts are especially good. 

for two: 
takoyaki 9/10 - yum :)
tofu nuggets 8/10 - really interesting
wasabi octopus salad - too raw for my taste, but its probably just me 6/10
vegetable curry udon - 8/10 
black sesame ice cream - 10/10 sooo good
iced mochi - 10/10 the mango one was especially delicious!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
-AWESOME service
-Low prices
-great quality food

Cons:
-very limited menu (I wish they had more, I love it there so much)
-they close early during the early week (gotta have Manpuku more often)"}
{"text":"The other reviews are so right in saying that this location is quite difficult to find, but offers great food at a good value! It's hidden away in the food court corner, but the entire shop is authentically Japanese (the servers communicate with one another in Japanese). I ordered the curry udon with beef, and though I expected beef brisket, I should have known (based off the price) that it would be beef flank bits. The flavour was great though! My friends ordered una tama don (eel with egg) and hotate rice (scallop with egg), both of which I sampled. I found that the taste was similar, and relied heavily on the okonomiyaki sauce. My friend said that his kitsune udon did not taste as yummy as my curry udon. We also shared a takoyaki, which I found to be overly doughy. Overall, not a bad place to visit on a budget!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Manpuku years ago and I'm so glad she did. It's not the easiest place to find having to go inside Village in the Grange foodcourt near AGO and OCAD, very basic space and it usually spills out into the foodcourt. They get very busy at peak times (lunch & dinners). Today, I guess I got in off-peak times 5:30pm... Yey Me! Got to pick my table.

I ordered:
- beef curry udon
Udon was cooked perfectly, not overly salty, just added a few dash of togorashi for some spice
- takoyaki (made to order, 20 minute wait)
Great texture and the sauce is just right / not too sweet... YUMM!

Total came up to $15 including tax and tip.
The food is simple but good (best takoyaki in town) and price is unbeatable for the quality and flavour! Service is friendly and attentive. Never had to flag anyone down since my tea and water were always filled.

Comfort food at it's best! 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the food court next to OCAD/AGO. The menu is very simple and cheap. With this restaurant, simplicity rules all.The interior is basic and the food is authentic and non-BS. I ordered the generic udon noodle in soup. It's a great size for a snack (2 of them for dinner). The udon was just the right level of chewy and the soup was well-balanced between salty and sweet. Upon discovering this place less than 2 months ago, I have already been here a few times."}
{"text":"Okay here's a bit of history, I came here when it first opened. Loved it, at the time the noodle game wasn't as big as it is now. It had a great portion and a great price. So I know how much the quality have gone down over the time. 

I went here 4 months ago trying non-udon items such as the eel rice, the ramen and the chawamisu. 

Eel rice had like 3 grams of eel everything else was just egg and too much sauce.

Ramen was worst than instant noodles.

Chawamisu was sponged like (overcooked) and green. The bottom was all wet.

I vowed not to come back again. But my friend was like it's kinda your fault for not going to the udon dishes. Which was fair. 



I decided to give this place one more chance because of the nostalgia and strictly ordered udons. Tried the Niku udon and curry udon. I also tried the tofu nuggets.

Tofu nuggets 3/5
I tried the ones at Konjiki and it was amazing there. So I just wanted to see their rendition of this dish. The filling was amazing but there no crunch. It's pan fried and it doesn't offer that nugget shell like Konjiki.


Niku udon 3/5
The meat was dry.
Udon was good, soft and smooth.
Soup was very very light.

Curry udon 3/5
Meat was dry like  it was frozen
Udon was good
Soup was way too thin for curry based udon.

I'll probably won't return until I hear things improve."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...

So, the restaurant is located in a bit of a rundown bit of a depressing food court.  It is a restaurant so don't despair if you walk into the mall and find all the food kiosks to be closed.  

I ordered the salad udon.  I was expecting some sort of soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger type dressing ... what I got was a bowl of noodles topped with some waxy tasting lettuce - DROWNING in hyper sour, very from the bottle tasting ITALIAN dressing.  

My husband ordered some sort of rice and meat dish.  What he got was a sad looking bowl of rice topped with an even sadder lump of ground beef cooked in sweet brown sauce ... basically something I could have made at home but better.  

We were also a little disappointed in the portion size of our meals too.  Even though we managed to finish both our dishes, we left hungry.  

Not sure if it was an off day for the restaurant but we'll most likely not come back to see...

p.s. There are no highchairs"}
{"text":"Manpuku specializes in serving up hot bowls of japanese udon in contrast with the sea of new ramen places opening up.

The restaurant itself is tucked in the corner of the food court inside the grange plaza. The decor is nice and clean with wooden accents and a bar facing the kitchen. It is a little on the small side though, so I would avoid with big groups (more than 4).

The menu has an assortment of Japanese udon, rice and ramen. there is an additional menu on the wall which you can order off from.

I got the niku (beef) udon combo, which includes soup/salad/chips and takosen (octopus balls between 2 rice crackers). You should try the takosen at least once, definitely worth it! The udon itself and the broth were really good and the beef was nicely seasoned and flavorful.

Personally one of my favorite noodle places when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed the udon here! Simple yet flavorful. The noodles are cooked to perfection and the service was pretty quick.
You get to try many types of dishes as the serving is small.
Would love to try the onigiri next time."}
{"text":"Great place! Came here a few times and tried a variety of their rice dishes.

Hotate rice (scallop & egg):
-this was good,  the egg compliments the scallop very well, the teriyaki and mayo top it off well and the whole thing tastes a bit like okonomiyaki

Shigure don (beef & onions on rice):
-tasted great, the beef and onions was really moist and sweet

Chicken skewers with rice:
I wouldnt recommend, it is one of the priciest items on the menu but  their wasn't a lot of meat and the chicken skewers were not the best tasting

Natto curry:
The natto curry is good but would only recommend to people who actually likes natto

Their black sesame icecream is a must try. It is rich and noticeably better tasting than those that you would get at an all you can eat Japanese restaurant. Strongly recommend it if you don't mind spending 4 dollars on 2 scopes of icecream.  

Overall,  the dishes were great for the price, and I would definitely go back and try their udon dishes."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in terms of udon in Toronto.  Good clear broth, perfectly cooked noodles (springy and resists the teeth, but not soggy or chewy), and your choice of toppings.  More generous than Japan with the toppings, but almost the same price.  I eat here every day, as I go to school across the street.  Everything is pretty delicious, even if you don't compare it to the other food court stuff, and it leaves you feeling good and satisfied.  

One of the few places to get takoyaki that I know of, but not that great, to be fair.  It was heavy and doughy, and there wasn't that much octopus in it.  Can't compare to getting it fresh of the truck in Kyoto and eating it with a good friend by the river."}
{"text":"I came here again with the same friend nearly 1 year after my first visit. I was surprised to see so many people waiting for Manpuku to open, but I guess that's just a sign of how good it is.

I went for the kake udon again (I'm cheap ok?) and got the takosen + salad combo option with it for an extra $2. The kake udon once again, is delicious. They don't skimp on noodles but there's a lot of soup so when you look at it you wonder if you'll be full or not from it. By the end of the meal though I was totally full, like pregnant full. The takosen to my tastebuds and eyes is no different from takoyaki except there's 3 balls instead of 6 (but think of the price difference!!) and the salad was very good; dressing was light so I think it was pretty healthy but taste was fantastic as well.

It's a very relaxing place in the morning especially because I went when classes had already ended. I'll be coming back when school starts again, to use the glorious food of Manpuku to heal myself from the pain of student life."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place in Toronto. Cheap affordable menu that hasn't changed for the past six years. They have a hidden menu on the wall near their washroom incase you don't find anything you crave in their damaged laminated menu. Expect decently sized + OK tasting food and fast service. Their famous line is that takoyaki takes 20 minutes to prepare, but in reality its usually around 10 - 15 mins.

The venue can get really humid in the summer, and its small enough that it fills up quickly for lunch and dinner on some days. Also when the owner is away, the service tends to slow down.

Note: They have a combo option where you can get any dish + takosen (pretty much three takoyaki pieces) + salad / soup for $3 extra. This is much more worth than getting their takoyaki imo."}
{"text":"This small eatery is hidden inside the food court. There's not a lot of seating but people eat fairly quickly and don't linger too long. Came here on a Thursday night and it seemed like the audience was mostly university kids. The price is very cheap - you can get a bowl of udon for 5.99. They have a variety of small snacks. They make their takoyaki fresh so it takes approximately 20 mins from when you order. I wasn't a fan of their sticky rice- it was too salty! I'd come here again for a quick and cheap bite."}
{"text":"The hotate rice was fantastic. The curry was good. The takoyaki looked really good, but we haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"definitely the best Udon place I've tried. I ordered the Tsukiji Udon and it was not too salty at all, lots of flavour and I didnt have to douse it in the usual japanese spice that comes with udons like i usually do!

I highly recommend the takoyaki as Ive tried many from Guu to other places in North York, and theres is top notch. Super crispy shell, creamy inside and amazing flavour from what I think is dried squid on the outside?

*Side note* if it is your first time in the area (like me) it may be confusing to find, but it is literally on the opposite side of OCAD and located in the food court there. 

Definitely dying to go back. GREAT portions and prices!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend not having that much expectations except that I wouldn't have to pay much. Over-all wonderful experience. Love the food, vibe, and staff!! Great price for a good meal! Their takoyaki is really tasty and the udon was simple, tasty but not salty. Will def come back to try other things in their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing! Both food and service is great! 
Takoyaki takes some time to make (~20mins) but I order it almost every time! Definitely worth it! Their udon is very tasty too and filling! I tried a majority of the things there and love it! Surprisingly I like their tofu nuggets, cause I'm not a fan of fried tofu but it's really good

Cheap and tasty food + friendly service!"}
{"text":"Place is definitely bang for buck. Their portions are tiny. I had their ramen. Their broth is lacking flavour. Their noodles are OK. Toppings are lacking. They have a simple menu. Id rather goto santouka or sensotei. Probably won't go here again. Unless I want something super cheap."}
{"text":"Simple dishes, done well.  Donburis, udons, and small appetizer plates for the nearby starving students.  For the uncultured and undecided, the handy menus have big pictures of everything.

The $4.5 Wakame Udon was lighter fare with seaweed, egg, and crispy rice - no meat.  The broth wasn't overly salty, and the crispy rice was a unique contrast to the soft noodles.  Simply a cheap, warm treat for a cold, winter day in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food great price.. The place is hidden inside village by the grange. Tried the natto curry and it's delicious"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the place to go to for some cheap and delicious udon. They have several types of udon and rice options on the menu averaging approximately $5 to $6. For an extra $2 you can make it a combo and choose two from tako-san (basically takoyaki, highly recommended), miso soup, and salad. Honestly such a good deal. Service is great and food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I think that for the price being paid, Manpuku delivers very well in terms of quality, and variety of menu options. For my first visit, I ordered one of the udons (forgot the name), a takosen, and my bf got the unatama don. I agree with other reviewers who say that the udon soup base lacks flavour and that the takoyaki (which is in the takosen) could be better, but keep in mind that both items are around the $5 mark, and for restaurants that deliver better quality on these items, they also charge a few dollars more. The more expensive item, unatama don, was delicious though, and I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dons, as well as their other snack items that aren't too common around Toronto. Overall, no Manpuku does not deliver Guu quality food, but it does provide decent and interesting items at a very affordable price. So all things considered, I think this is an excellent Japanese fast food place, and I envy the OCAD students who can come here on a daily basis!

SIDENOTE: On my first attempt at visiting this place, I couldn't find it cause I didn't realize it was inside the Grange =( So now that you've read this, you can avoid looking like an idiot walking up and down the street like I was !"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????kake udon?????????upgrade?set??????????takosen???????????????????????????7????????????????? ????) ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!?????????????????????????????????????????????????!????????????:D"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite little places to get some authentic Japanese food in Toronto (and by authentic I mean not fancy or high in quality but genuine and close to culture.....if you know what I mean). It's a hidden gem! (literally, it's really hard to find). It's located inside a food court type of area and I've walked past this restaurant a thousand times without actually knowing it's there! 

This place offers great food for a low price and it's so definitely worth it! It's a pretty small restaurant so I would probably recommend going by yourself or with a small pack. The interior really does remind me of small Japanese shops back in Japan and the chefs/waitresses always whole heartedly welcomes you, so you get the 100% Japanese dining experience : )

Every time I return, I always wanna try at least one thing new from their menu but there are a couple items that even when I tell myself not to get, I always end up with an extra order of it, and they are: Takoyaki, Edamame, and Yaki Onigiri (trust me on the Yaki Onigiri...they are some bomb a** rice balls). The Takoyaki are made just like how street vendors in Japan would make them. The Edamame aren't just your basic soybean sprinkled with salt; Manpuku serves them sprinkled with just a touch of garlic powder, and the Yaki Onigiri are grilled to how homemade Japanese rice balls are meant to be made.

I really recommend coming here if you're not big on breaking your wallet and are looking for a nice and satisfying Japanese style lunch : ) As a student,  I have to say it's perfect for me as it's close to U of T and OCAD University as well so go ahead take my word for it. Try it out for yourselves : )"}
{"text":"very friendly service earns one extra star!
very reasonable price, beef rice was okay, tofu nugget was delicious!
may return for other items"}
{"text":"the food is cheap and good. there is no sushi but it has the other comfort food that you usually dont find in japanese restaurants.  owners are japanese and i love their curry dishes.  very reasonably priced and very tasty."}
{"text":"Right away walking. In here you get an aroma of amazing smells. The seating ranges from counter space to tables to booths. I love how they do complimentary tea I think that's a great touch! Pricing is more than fair And portions are well worth the price! They're best for casual quick bites. Location is super convenient being near dundas and McCaul. The pudding is amazing"}
{"text":"At this point, I have tasted most of the menu. For the price range, it is so hard to go wrong with Manpuku! Always modest and welcoming, this is a go-to for social eats, where folks new to Japanese cuisine can get acquainted with tasty food. There are also dishes like natto for those who have acquired the palate. On average, you could easily satisfy yourself with around $10, but I tend to get wide-eyed and spend up to $15 for myself.

Off the top of my head, my favourite menu items include the imo mochi, hotate rice (scallop and egg), and takowasa (wasabi pickled octopus - as long as I'm not finishing it myself). Their entrees are all pretty safe. Just note that this is not a ramen restaurant, and that their ramen (which is just 7.99) doesn't come in a rich broth or with premium toppings.

P.S. They do tend to run out of goodies towards the end of the day. :)"}
{"text":"I love that this place is tucked away in a little food court. I love the restaurant itself, it's comfy and homey and makes me feel like I'm going to get some decent food. I'm not crazy about the service - our server seemed really disinterested in taking our order or refilling our water. The food was okay, definitely worth it's price but nothing out of the ordinary. I was itching to try the natto but it only came with noodles and not on its own as a side, so I didn't want to use my one opportunity to dine here on a dish I wasn't sure I'd like.

The udon noodles are good, they've got a nice texture to them. The soup base is delicious as well but the meat is just okay. The curry udon is just the same thing with a spoon from a curry stock added in, and one carrot and one potato. 

The place was certainly popular with the crowds coming in from OCAD though. Even at 530pm this place was full-up. If I'm ever back, I'll try out the natto, I promise! But for it's price, it's a no-brainer choice if you're looking for something to warm you up on a cold day."}
{"text":"You get food worth far more than what you pay, I can guarantee you that. 

Manpuku Japanese Eatery has been known for their udon dishes and YES THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The Niku Udon (Beef w/ Udon) and the Tsukimi Udon (Wakame Seaweed, Tempura Bits, and Fried Egg w/ Udon) were ordered by me and a friend, the 3rd person ordered Gyuudon (Beef Rice Bowl). I'm going to have to say that all were worth their price if not more and I love handling my money wisely and this place's QUALITY & QUANTITY for under $10 makes me want to live here (almost).

The Niku Udon was a light broth with perfectly cooked thin slices of beef. You can't go wrong with its simplicity here.

The Gyuudon was a simple rice bowl dish with lightly stir fried slices of thinly cut beef and there was plenty of enough flavour and juices for my friend to enjoy it. However, they're an extremely big eater so it didn't fill them up as much as they'd like.

It would be cool if they had a regular size and a larger size with an extra dollar or two and I would definately pay for it too.

The Tsukimi Udon I ordered was BLISS. Heavenly bliss. 
The tempura bits added that familiar sweet flavour I would get in ebifry, the wakame had that refreshingly salty sea flavour, and the egg was the perfect amount of protein addition! The broth flavour was light enough to perfectly hold the entire bowl together. A homey, perfect symphony in my mouth.

The thing is with Udon VS Ramen is that even if you did order thicker ramen noodles, udon noodle's thickness still wins in the long run. Thinner noodles are meant for more flavour packed broth like Miso based broths. Udon noodles are already so thick that being in a light broth and subtler flavours makes you enjoy the dish as a whole lot better and Manpuku executes this elegantly. Did I forget to mention how cheap it is to fill me up???

I also ordered the Fish Cakes made with burdock root and it was SO GOOD. Felt so right at home with this side dish to my udon.

My friends finished off the HOMEMADE flans they make here and licked every last drop of the caramel, it was so good ugh!!!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't get one because my friend ordered the last one sobs...

They also sell japanese snacks up at the front and I love their cheesecake! INFINATELY BETTER THAN UNCLE TETSU's SUGAR JOKE OF A CAKE! And I bet if you bought enlugh the same cost as UT's cheesecake, it's the same size but with better quality lol. The dorayaki with red bean is always a recommend, never too sweet.

Can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on Yelp and devided to come here for a week day lunch as I was working in the area. Ordered the curry udon   and it was ready within 5 mins even though it was quite busy. Personally, I didn't think that it tasted as great as the reviews say, but it is definitely a good price. Would come to try something else on the menu if I'm in the area again, but not a place I would go out of my way for. 
Tip: Order take out and eat it in the food court outside or somewhere else, as the restaurant is very small and has little (no?) A/C."}
{"text":"Location
If you are having trouble finding this place it's because the restaurant is hidden. To be exact, Manpuku is actually situated inside a plaza/food court across from Art Gallery of Ontario. The restaurant itself isn't big to begin with but don't be afraid to ask the art students where this place is.

Service
They aren't heavily staffed so you gotta be patient with the service. The restaurant is divided into 2 floors and in the summer no matter where you go, it's super hot lols. I'm not sure if they actually have air conditioning. The staff nevertheless are pretty nice and will refill your water periodically.

Food
This is a place that offers GOOD udon; it is in fact one of the best udon places in downtown. Seriously I'm not kidding lols. To begin with the broth is amazing, it is full of flavor and the restaurant isn't stingy so you can drink as much as you want. The udon is legit so it's not thin and it's not soggy - perfectly made so that you can slurp it all the way. Second, you are looking at the cheapest udon prices in downtown Toronto. On average, the udon bowls are $5-6 and trust me it will fill you up. I really like ordering the curry udon because it's special, everywhere else will offer beef/chicken/seafood/tempura. I've had the takoyaki side dish before which wasn't bad but from my experience, it takes a bit of time to prepare. If you are coming here for the first time, don't go ordering the rice bowls because this place is known for udon. I have a feeling their rice bowls aren't up to par based on some of the online reviews."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this place has 4 stars :S

I've been wanting to try this place for some time now and finally tried it with the family.

Right away walking into the place, it has hot and hard to breath. It was mid August and the temperature outside was better.

We ordered the shigure don, a crab rice, ramen and shrimp balls. (Don't remember the actual names on the menu)

The first rice dish was beef which had no taste and comparable with canned food. I thought it was more like dog food, the rice was mush too.

The second rice dish with crab was slightly better with proper rice that wasn't mush. Points for using real crab but it was cold which it was supposed to be but it wasn't really enjoyable.

Ramen was probably best, decent taste but full of msg.

Last was the shrimp and clam balls made the same as the octopus balls but with different ingredients. Tasted alright, doughy and little ingredients but the taste was good.

Overall, food was mostly bad, I've been to japan and the food is a disgrace and is even bad to Toronto's standards, atmosphere was bad but service was great and fairly cheap approximately $10 per person.
I would say not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was first introduced to this restaurant by a good friend. I love how small and quaint the restaurant is. The service and prices are super good and so is the food. Authentically Japanese, I would always recommend this restaurant to anyone who craves small shareable plates at great prices. Also, a must eat is the takoyaki -- it's the best I've ever had in the city!"}
{"text":"This place is GOOD.  Ever since I went there once with Catherine L., I couldn't get this place out of my mind.  Since then, I've tried to go there 2 or 3 times, and each time I was thwarted by either getting there too late, or one time, by a roaring private party.  

Today, not only did we get there on time, there were no too hip too cool parties to hinder me from what I was craving - gimme my warming bowl of noodles on this chilly day!  I had a bowl of their regular noodle soups, replacing the udon with the 0 calorie yam noodles.  The broth was light and delicious.  The noodles were chewy and yet crisp, with a very pleasant feel on the tongue.  For an extra $2, I added a salad and the takosen .  So good!  For dessert, we got the ice cream mochi which is an ice cream ball surrounded by a glutinous rice cake layer.  There are four flavours - green tea, mango, red bean and chocolate.  Mmm... a great way to end the meal!  I left with my belly warm and full, extremely satisfied and my desire unquenched for another go at the yumminess that is Manpuku.

Credit cards accepted, friendly, attentive service, and they sell durian flavoured candy at the counter.  Eeps!"}
{"text":"Cozy little spot inside the village. Best Miso Chicken Udon ever."}
{"text":"my first time here was a couple years back and it was my first time trying takoyaki after being so curious. i was a little surprised how the inside was so soft but after having it i fell in love! the flavours are so unique and the crisp outside layer is so delicious. the udon was amazing too, broth was very nice and smooth. plus the prices are awesome, u get so much food at a good cost. im craving takoyaki right now, go check em out!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with my friend , as I was visiting the city. With yelp's help :) 

We came by 9:20 ish and it was hard to find it, as it was inside the building. We were seated quickly as the waitress gave us the menus.

My friend wanted the takoyaki, but sadly there was no more. So she just got the curry don.

As the prices are really cheap, I had a hard time deciding what to order, so i took a ochazuke (i think) and a udon (i forgot which one) which were both 3.99 wow so cheap.

I ordered 2 main dishes because I read the portions were small, but it was a perfectly sized meal. Maybe it's small compared to western restaurants, but for a Japanese place, it is totally normal. 

I also wanted a dessert, which I opted for their flan, but sadly, they also didn't have it. So I had the matcha cheesecake.

For the actual taste, everything tasted sooo good.
The onigiri in the ochazuke was maybe a bit too salty for my taste but the udon was perfect. The matcha cheesecake is also very good, it was a very good combination of both. It didn't taste too much like cream cheese, as it was just slightly sweet."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the food court. All their menu items are very reasonably priced and their speed of service is pretty quick.

I got the udon which I really liked and will likely order again when I visit next time. Their hotate rice (scallop and egg) for $8.99 was ok, but I don't think it's worth the price. I also got the takoyaki and tofu nugget, which tasted yummy. However, I wished the green tea cheese cake had a stronger green tea taste."}
{"text":"Tasty food at reasonable prices! And the portions are just perfect. I love getting their Soboro Don and Hotate Rice. It gets pretty busy there, but the turnover is pretty quick."}
{"text":"I love the takoyaki here. Yummy..they were soft and tasty and came out piping hot. This is cooked pefectly the batter is nice and soft and the squid is cooked well. I love the sauce on this too. You should definitely give these a try. 

Since this is close to OCAD the prices are great too! The portion sizes are decent. I ordered the raymen with pork. The broth was a bit sweet, but still good. Not the best raymen I've tried but it was still tasty. My only complaint would be that I wish my egg was less cooked.

Otherwise if you want something cheap, but good to eat go check them out."}
{"text":"Cheap decent Japanese food. I think I'm spoiled because I get amazing Japanese food at my in laws so my expectations are always quite high. This place was pretty disappointing. I came on a hot day and there is no a/c and the place itself was pretty dirty. The thing I love about Japanese food is that the flavours are always so perfectly balanced without leaving you with that heavy feeling after a good meal. The dishes here were pretty bland and the quality was pretty low. I get that it's cheap, but I still have a certain expectation for food and this place didn't hit the mark."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Came in at 9:45pm, everything except dons and udons are soldout. The beef don is plain and served with soggy rice."}
{"text":"everything on the menu is great! The price is right! only japanese comfort food. Do not forget to go for the combo (2 of soup, chip, takosen, salad I think) for another $2"}
{"text":"My go to for a quick takoyaki and udon fix! It's authentic, delicious and cheap! My dad who is a suuuuper picky eater loves it as well.

It is quite a gem in the village by the grange food court! I recommend going for the 'combo' option - $2 extra dollars for a salad and takosen - more than enough food for around $10 (with a niku udon)"}
{"text":"This place offers a number of japanese options. They've got several menus, so make sure you pay attention to the walls around you in addition to the menu.

You can sit up at the counter, or grab a seat inside.

Tea is offered. Comes with nice chopsticks and spoons.
Prices are low, portion sizes are alright for what you're paying. You can get several different snack items.

They also have outdoor seating. By \"outdoor\" I mean in the literal sense.
The restaurant is inside the food court, if you need a lot of seats but they're pretty busy, you can arrange to sit out in the food court right across the entrance. They'll deliver the food to you though you might not get the full service. But I think the AC's better outside. They'll come out to pick up the bowls after some time, if you don't bring it back."}
{"text":"I finally got to eat here! So I went here recently for an early dinner with my parents. This eatery is super cute and it's located in The Village by the Grange. It's an actual restaurant not one of the stalls in the food court.

We were greeted by a friendly yet soft-spoken server. She brought us tea right away. All the staff here are really nice. We wanted to start off with the Takosen (3 for $2.99) but we were told they ran out of senbei so we essentially got 3 Takoyaki instead (they discounted us $0.50 for the missing senbei so we paid $2.49 for 3 pieces). They told us it would take 20 minutes to prepare the Takoyaki, so we actually got our meals first but that was OK. 

I ordered the Wakame Udon ($4.49), my dad had the Niku Udon ($5.99) and mom had the Yakatori Don ($10.99).

My Wakame Udon was OK but a bit plain. It had lots of Wakame seaweed in it, along with green onions and what looked like rice krispies. I chose the fish broth instead of the vegetable broth and it was flavorful but not too salty which I liked. The Udon was nicely cooked, not too mushy just the right consistently with the right amount of chewiness. I should have ordered the Udon with the fish cake or the fried egg because mine was too plain, but that was my fault for ordering it.

I had some of the beef from my dad's Niku udon. It was tender and had a good flavour. His meal had plenty of beef in it. My mom said that my dad's beef broth was much tastier than my fish broth. I also had a skewer of my mom's yakatori. The chicken was good and had a slightly sweet taste to it. It was very tiny though. The amount of meat on each skewer was about the size of my thumb.  She got 4 tiny chicken skewers and a fried egg on top of a mound of seasoned rice with shredded nori seaweed sprinkled on top. Both my parents really enjoyed their meals. 

The Takoyaki was the best part of the meal. The piece of octopus inside was tiny, literally smaller than my pinky nail. However the dough surrounding it was heavenly. It was airy and tasted so good. I wished we had ordered more pieces. They were topped with this delicious sauce and with bonito flakes. If you go here you should order the Takoyaki or Takosen.

The place is charming, the staff are nice, the food is good and the prices reasonable. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I loved the Kitsune Udon - amazing! 4.50$ for a great meal

To be fair, I next had the negitama don, and was less than impressed with that, and the Curry Don I also did not enjoy as much, so not everything here is amazing.
Japanese speaking staff, and impeccable service. 
Would still strongly recommend"}
{"text":"After having such a great first experience, I decided to come back today for a quick dinner. Unfortunate to say, this second experience was a little disappointing.

The tofu nuggets were great - they reminded me of those fish-shaped tofus you get at hotpot/asian supermarkets, but the yakitori don was subpar. It was lukewarm when served to us so the rice was already getting a little hard and the sauce of the chicken skewers was starting to coagulate. It wasn't that tasty and I wouldn't order it again.

Solely from this experience, I would give a 2/5 rating but since my first experience was actually really good, my averaged rating for this restaurant would be a 3/5. It seems to be a real hit or miss."}
{"text":"It was my first time to go here but it will not be my last.  Ordered immediately the takoyaki and followed the other Yelper's advise and waited patiently for it.  A good lunch spot if there are not too many of you.  I went here with my mate so I had the Chicken Udon and he had the Beef Gyudon.  Both were satisfying and flavourful.  The portions were just right for a lunch meal.  My udon had a good broth to noodle ratio with good amount of chicken pieces.  Same with my friend's rice bowl, with even an egg at the top.  The servers were very friendly and they were prompt in refilling our tea cups.  I like that.  Even though they were a small establishment and quite busy, I like that they never forget about the service.  I finally got the takoyaki and I must say it is quite good.  Comparable to other great takoyakis I have had in the past.  As well, I did not feel rushed to pay or get out even though it was the lunch rush hour.  Will definitely come here again and try the other items, maybe on a lazy day try the sesame ice cream.  Hmmm....ice cream."}
{"text":"Manpuku is one of my favourite lunch spots in the area. Located right across OCAD, the restaurant is hidden inside a foodcourt. Offering a variety of Japanese options, I would describe their menu as simple homestyle cooking. 

The portions are decent for the price you pay, but if you are really hungry - I would probably order 2 items.  With most dishes averaging in the $5-$7 range, you really can't go wrong.  My favourite items on the menu are the beef niku udon, curry don and takoyaki.  A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The generally high reviews of this \"fast food\" Japanese restaurant confuse me.  I looked up \"best udon in toronto\" and this place popped up as number 1!

My high expectations were crushed when I was served instant noodle style udon in a broth with little to no flavour. But maybe I went on a bad day...

If you're thinking about trying this place out, keep in mind that the food is worth what you pay for. The items on the menu are generally cheap for a reason.  The general population of this area is lower income students so I understand why.

Definitely not the best udon in town.  Scroll down to the next few \"udon\" recommended places from yelp."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Love, love, love the Curry Beef & Takosen combo!  Salad is yummy too"}
{"text":"I ordered the curry beef udon and I thought the curry sauce was too much. My friend ordered the udon with just the beef and onion, and I preferred that dish because the broth was lighter and nicely flavoured.

We also got the rice triangles wrapped with seaweed, and (canned) tuna inside. I wouldn't order it again. It was just a big ball of rice with less than a teaspoon of tuna inside. On my way out, saw the cute japanese pancake looking things wrapped in plastic. I tried the sesame one, and it was not good. It's like sponge cake but tastes stale. 

Service was very friendly. We came late in the evening an hour before closing, and most menu items were not available anymore."}
{"text":"I have probably been to Manpuku a hundred times. The service is always wonderful, my cup of tea is refilled before I even notice it's empty, and my food consistently arrives super quickly! 

My favorite thing to order is the wakame udon with shirataki noodles and extra fish cake. Even with all of those substitutions, the entire thing, with tax, comes out to around $7. It's so filling and so reasonably priced!

I also heartily recommend the takoyaki (worth the 20 minute wait!), that come out of the kitchen piping hot and loaded with dancing bonito flakes. The yakionigiri are another stand-by favorite. 

Finally, the cash register area boasts a number of hard-to-find Morinaga Japanese candies and snacks, so you can grab a package of mango hi-chews on your way out! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and super cheap. It's hidden in a food court and was a bit hard to find initially. The noodles are really good and full-sized for as low as $5-6. Overall a hidden gem and definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful Japanese eatery! 

Really authentic in terms of taste. I ordered a ton don and it was a really big portion for the price I was paying. The food did not take long at all well especially if you go at 9pm on a Saturday! 

It is a bit of a trek out of downtown but it was worth the cheap eat! The service was good and they greet you when you come in, would've liked a exit greeting that I normally get from other Japanese eateries! 

Would recommend! Please go check it out"}
{"text":"Located in close proximity to Ryerson and OCAD in The Grange, Manpuku is a sit-in Japanese restaurant settled in within The Grange food court (usually busy with students and workers in the area around lunch hour) with takeout options. The service is quick, the broth and udon is delicious and the prices are quite agreeable for my student budget. I've eaten in at Manpuku once and today was my first time getting takeout from them. Both times the service was fast and I didn't have to wait long for my food ^_^"}
{"text":"I'm glad it's not another ramen shop. This place sells simple Japanese food like takoyaki, udon, beef bowl, and rice ball. It's just an eatery selling you delicious food. I'm a fan.

Prices appear low but portions are smaller too compared to other places. If you eat like me, you'll probably need 2-3 dishes to be satisfied. It's not expensive but I wouldn't go to this place for value. You should come here because they do simple things right. 

There's an aura of authenticity about this place. That is because the staff are Japanese. The small portion size is also a Japanese thing."}
{"text":":) it's true they can survive without sushi, I always go here because this place offers great food for cheap :) great for students"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! I always bring my friends here and they always seem to love it. Can't go wrong with the curry udon which is my personal favourite, but many of my friends love the niku udon as well. The noodle texture is perfect and prices are cheap at about $6. This place is so good that I usually get a noodle refill for an extra dollar or so. Overall, great lunch spot if you happen to be in the area!"}
{"text":"Take out is superfast, took them only 3 minutes from order to completion! 

Shigure don - Portion was a bit too big, no vegetables made for a very unbalanced meal. Meat was tender and flavourful. 

Niku udon - This was delicious, how do they make that broth? 

There is also a dark broth/soup, but it was too hot and too much liquid. 

Protip - They needed 20 min to make the Takoyaki, will have to try next time. 

Damage  - Only $14 after tax before tip. Choose Manpuku, not McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after work. We were able to get in before they got busy, which should be sometime after 6ish. The location is hidden off in a corner behind that bubble tea place within the Village By the Grange. 

Hands down the best udon I've ever tasted in Tdot. I ordered the kake udon. The noodles were cooked fresh so they had a very smooth yet quite chewy texture. Portion is definitely worth the price they charged. The service was also fairly fast seeing that all the waitresses were literally running inside the small little shop to make their food deliveries. 

We also tried their famous takoyaki. It was definitely worth the 20min. wait. You could tell that they were freshly off the grill since all the flakes on top of the takoyaki were literally moving when they were served! 

My only complaint was that they didn't have any AC inside the restaurant. It got so hot inside even when there weren't that many ppl around. We had to carry our food outside to eat in the food court, which obviously lacked the Japanese eatery atmosphere... :( However, the food and service definitely deserve 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Came here for a meal a couple of days ago. Very friendly and courteous staff. The prices are also quite cheap, however, the portions are not too filling. I ordered the Beef Udon and an order of Takoyaki. I wish the Takoyaki had more octopus inside. I came here on a hot day, and found it very hot inside the restaurant and was sweating - could use some more fans. 

Overall, I found the service great, but the food mediocre. May return if I'm in the area, but not worth travelling to."}
{"text":"really Affordable price for japanese restaurant,  I ordered the NikuUdon which was tasty, i was not a big fan of their onigiri though. I wont mind trying again."}
{"text":"Came here at around 7:30 on a Friday night which of course was not smart of me because it was pretty crowded. The doorway is sort of small so it gets kind of confusing in terms of who is looking to dine in vs who is just lining up for takeout. We were seated within 10mins. I decided to get the curry beef udon which is a pretty good price at 5.99. It came within probably 10mins. The first taste was a bit spicy but after a while it was just udon with beef, potatoes and a diluted curry broth. I liked the potatoes but the beef was kind of dry. It is a great comfort food dish.

Afterwards, I decided to try their matcha red bean dorayaki which is a nice sweet ending to the meal. Emphasis on the sweet. It was really sweet, especially for me who enjoys dessert and bubble tea, so I'd pay a bit of caution towards that. 

Overall, I would love to try it again but I will probably just grab takeout."}
{"text":"I frikkin LOVE this place. The Niku udon is so good and hot and fresh and filling!! Everything is SO cheap and for the price they taste amazing. The onigiris are a little salty, but nonetheless v v good snacks."}
{"text":"Great alternative to Guu instead of waiting 2 hours in line, this small little place under the Grange on McCaul is very good and serve the same izakaya type food. 

Be sure to get the Takoyaki (order it first, 20 mins wait, but worth it). Also liked the Curry Udon. They have a limited menu, but there's something there for everyone. Also be sure too check out the specials on the wall . 

I also was able to call ahead and ask them to save a table for me while I was heading there. They don't take reservations. 
They don't open Sundays and Mondays, and close early on some day."}
{"text":"I have been here and tried many dishes on their menu. My favorites are still their curry udon and curry don. Their takoyaki or takosen and shigure don are also pretty good.

Don: their rice dishes are all very tasty, but the only problem I have is that they don't cook their rice very consistently. It's either mushy or too hard and while my brother has had decently cooked rice mine has always been one of the above. Shame.

Udon: their udon is amazing and while you can tell that the noodles were frozen, it doesn't make much of a difference as, in terms of homemade udon noodles, these are the best in Toronto. Shipped flash frozen straight from their noodle manufacturer in Japan.

Curry: it's homemade and contains trace amounts of msg. I have a sensitive stomach for such so this is a very pleasant surprise.

Takoyaki/Takosen: it's pretty good. Could be better and I prefer mine with larger pieces of octopus. I've actually gotten some which contained either no or trace amounts of octopus such that I couldn't even tell if I had any while eating it. This could be a good thing for people who aren't very familiar with octopus, however.

Onigiri/Yakionigiri: i've had better but I don't care much for onigiri in the first place.

The other thing to note is the price for their dishes is amazing. Very competitive with the other food in the area yet this food isn't prepared in advance."}
{"text":"i come here mainly for the takoyaki. its really good considering they actually make them with the proper cookware,unlike other places that just fry them from frozen. friendly staff,i havent been there in more than a year and i was so surprised they remember my name. (i was so ashamed of myself for not remembering theirs)
this joint has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Super cheap and yummy! I got the curry udon, and a yaki onigiri. The udon was seriously good and filling for the small price. It was very flavourful, and the udon noodles were thick and chewy. The yaki onigiri, however, was disappointing. There was barely any filling inside the rice, and was pretty boring. 
The inside is clean and the service is friendly and fast. Just don't come here with a big group as the place gets busy quickly and seating is limited."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and every time has been great. You won't find a better place downtown in terms of value for money - pretty much all the items on the menu are less than $7. If you come during lunchtime though, be prepared to wait because the place isn't very big and it will be packed. However the staff do their best to accommodate. I'll usually get the curry udon or the niku udon - both of which are really flavorful and surprisingly filling. Also do not leave the place without ordering the takoyaki - it's amazing! I went there one time and they ran had run out of takoyaki so I was super disappointed, but I ended up getting the takosen as a replacement which was really good. Will definitely come back to this place again, but will maybe try the take-out option next time."}
{"text":"First time here... Prices are really good so I thought I would give it a try. small menu but that means they can really focus on getting things right. Had the Shigure Don (beef on rice).  Portion was about right for the low price. Flavour was good.  If I were in the neighborhood regularly I would try this place out more often to see how they do on the other items.  Servers were so polite and courteous... don't see enough of that in North America... especially from young people."}
{"text":"Great place for udon at great prices. Food is always consentent at very fair prices as well! Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Stop 6 of AlzCon 2k16. 
Keep in mind that there is no air conditioning or ice in this restaurant, so don't get pissy at the waiters, because you just got your warning. 
Ordered Natto, Niku (meat) Udon, and Takoyaki. 
All good. Niku Udon had beef, onions, and green onions. Very savory. First time having Natto and Takoyaki, which were both good. 
I recommend sitting next to a group of college kids who are discussing their plans for a single-player RPG with a battle system and story based on fighting viruses and city-wide epidemics, because that was the only thing which made this restaurant memorable. 
3/5."}
{"text":"We traveled about 5 blocks to get to the place... It's slightly hidden In an Asian food court. The place is very small quaint but homy. The food wasn't too great. The takoyaki was a bit too cakey for my liking. The pudding was a great disappointment."}
{"text":"Just love this place - it's cheap and delicious!

Some people say their udons are overcooked.  Mine was perfectly ok the time I went.  May be I prefer a softer texture.  Soup wasn't too salty either.  Just don't expect it to have a lot of toppings in the soup.

Takosen is an interesting appetizer.  It's definitely worth the wait (freshly made, around 15-20 mins?).  Basically it's a giant takoyaki sandwiched in two crispy Japanese rice crackers.

Location-wise it's a bit difficult to find.  My friend and I had to walk around the area a bit before finally locate the store.  It's at the end of the food court, and there's no A/C in the summer.  I remembered I was there sweating in the hot summer afternoon. :P

Final bill was still under $20 with two udons and two appetizers.  Good deal! :)

There are still few items on the menu I want to try next time: Curry Don (curry with rice), Ochazuke (rice in a tea broth).  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love Manpuku. 

Manpuku is a hidden gem.  Quite literally hidden and very much a gem. It's located in the far corner of the Village by the Grange food court and can be tricky to find the first time. But do persevere because, trust me, it is so worth it! 

What's great about Manpuku is the quality and quantity of food you get. The menu is varied, so everyone should be able to find a meal (or two or three!!) that they will enjoy. Also everything is super well priced! You can get an udon soup bowl for less than $5!!!!

Anyway, this place is super cheap and mega yummy. 10/10"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Price and food is very nice. For the udons, they don't really have many toppings but the udon itself is nice. But the overall dish is a but plain. We usually also get the octopus balls. I think they could use a bit more octopus bits. They could also use a bit more fry for the extra crisp outside but the flavour is very good in general. This is a cute place to hang out and grab a quick cheap lunch with some extra cash left over to be adventurous with appetisers."}
{"text":"If I had to eat at one restaurant for rest of my student life, Manpuku would be it.  The prices are incredible but the real jewel is the food.  Their udon has a great spring to the bite, everything else they add to it works together harmoniously to create a sense of comfort and warm deliciousness in each slurpy mouthful.  The takoyaki is a delight, the onigiri is well balanced between rice and filling, and the rice bowls are well seasoned and generous. 

In general, their portions for everything is darn good and their service is friendly.  I really hope they stay here for a long time.  

Manpuku, if you're reading this, I love you."}
{"text":"Ordered Negitama Gyudon, Hotate Rice, Yakitori Don and Takoyaki. I loved the Takoyaki! It is surprisingly chewy which I like!! For Negitama Gyudon, the beef was dry. The rest of the dishes were just okay. 
Affordable price though! I would go there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the curry rice and udon. Lots of vegetarian options. This is kind of a 'fast food place' you find in a lot of Japanese subway stations, which is exactly what I crave after a long day.

The owners are really nice and love to talk about cycling with me!"}
{"text":"* Service *

Friendly and attentive Japanese staff.  I practise my limited Japanese with staff and is encouraged by them.  Staff is very knowledgeable with the menu and will be happy to explain what the items are.  

* Food *

I mainly come here for the amazing udon soups they have particularly the curry (beef or pork).  I love their udon noodles and found it to taste like the ones I had in Japan.  Whenever I'm in the area and craving noodles or takoyaki*, this is the place to go! 

I also come here for the dessert $3.99.  So far I've only had the green tea cheese cake which is amazing!  I'm not too fond of New York cheese cake (I find it too bold and cheesy) but this cheese cake was very mild flavour in cheese but creamy in green tea texture.  It literally tastes like green tea ice cream except it's not as sweet and won't melt on you!  I wonder if they make it from scratch or if it's purchased at a place.  I have not found a green tea cheese cake in Asian grocery stores...

*Takoyaki takes approx. 20-mins to make (but it took about 10-mins for my batch) so if you plan to go there with limited time (e.g. lunch hour) call ahead. ^_~

Note 1: Tokyo Grill (Wellesley and Yonge) has amazing udon noodles too but cost more than Manpuku.  Portion seems a bit smaller and not satisfying enough for me at least for the lunch special.

Note 2: They do not serve sushi/sashimi as this place is a home-style comfort Japanese restaurant.  If you are interested in a good sushi restaurant and your budget is $30+ I would recommend Yuzu no Hana along Adelaide St. 

* Overall *

If you are in the area, I would recommend you trying this place out!  I love this place and recommend it to my friends.  The location is a bit of a \"secret\" but thankfully my OCAD friends told me about this place.  This unofficial cafeteria to OCAD is far better than Ryerson's area because of the variety of choice (e.g. Chinese, Korean and vegetarian) and price range is affordable (truly under $10)."}
{"text":"Great food for an amazing bargain especially in the downtown area. It has a real authentic Japanese home-style flavour to all of their dishes and I just keep coming back for more! Their curry udon noodles are amazing - cooked perfectly with the right mixture and texture of curry with the beef and the potatoes. It always comes out sizzling hot and I find myself ordering this dish every time I drop by here. Their green tea cheese cake is also not bad for the price but I do find it a bit bitter compared to the other green tea cheese cakes that I have had. 

The staff are friendly and polite and they do a great job making sure your experience is as best it can be. Overall, this is a very affordable and amazing place for authentic Japanese home-style food! However, it does get a bit hot during the summer times but you can get the take-out menu as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with 4 other coworkers. The restaurant was quite empty to my surprise, we were seated right away and given water and tea.

FOOD: The food was very good. I had the Tsukimi Udon ($5.49 udon with fish cakes and half fried egg), it was great and good amount of udon, not too salty. I also ordered tofu nuggets $3.99 which were delicious, and we shared two takoyaki ($4.99 per 6 balls). The takoyaki tasted great but personally found not enough octopus and too much dough. We have come to the conclusion certain dishes are cheaper due to its cheap ingredients but still tasted  very good. My coworkers all enjoyed their meal very much. My entire bill came to $12.

DRINKS: We didn't order any drinks but they do have sake and beer on the menu. They provided us with complimentary tea.

SERVICE: Food came super fast and the servers were very friendly and attentive. The bills also come around 15 minutes after the food arrives. I was able to add another item on my bill with no problem. We also split dishes among us and there was no issue. Debit and credit accepted.

I have to say I'm very impressed by this place. Good food, good service and good prices. I don't have anything to complain about therefore 5/5!"}
{"text":"Great cheap Japanese food! Try the amazing ramen with udon, delicious!"}
{"text":"Got the Unagi with egg bowl and it was pretty good! Definitely felt like the value of the food matched the price. My bf got the scallop bowl and that was pretty good as well. Realistically, I would give it a 3.5. There was a lot of egg with each of our bowls which kind of overpowered the unagi and scallop, but that's only one part of the menu and I wouldn't mind going back to try more dishes. The takoyaki had a bit too much batter, and not that much octopus imo, but still worth getting and sharing with friends."}
{"text":"My first encounter with Manpuku was based off a Yelp review when I was trying to find new and cheap eats in the area.  Firstly, the location didn't do it many favors but once you get past the location, the food totally won me over.

My go-to dishes are usually the udon (kitsune or the curry udon) or the soboro don with an order of takoyaki (Yes, I will wait 20 minutes for it, thanks for the warning!).  Overall, for the price and portion size, Manpuku is definitely worth a visit.  I was full without the need to add extra noodles for the udon.

Overall, recommended if you are looking for an inexpensive, cheap place to eat without being overwhelmed with menu options.  Avoid if you're looking for a quiet place where you have infinite amounts personal bubble space with fancy dishes."}
{"text":"Cheap and delightful. I always get their niku udon or shigure don rice dish. Both are excellent choices at a great price. This is one of my go-to restaurants when craving some good Japanese eats (not a sushi guy - sorry!). Staff are always very hospitable and polite. Never had a bad experience here and I've been going here for the last few years."}
{"text":"The price is very attractive but the taste was nothing impressive. I'd say the the price matches with the taste."}
{"text":"Really hard to find. It's in a food court so getting to the place was a little confusing. Overall, really cheap eats for a good price. Takoyaki was the best part, um the beef was a little dry in the rice bowl, everything else was good :)"}
{"text":"This place was highly reviewed and that is why we decided to try it while we were heading to an A.G.O event. I remember going to this place on a cold, chilly evening, and so warming up with a nice hot bowl of udon was satisfying. 

Location: Good thing there was google maps and yelp reviews. it would have been a little unexpected to find this INSIDE another plaza/ food court area. It is definitely a hidden place if we were just strolling down the street looking for food. 

Atmosphere: this is no \"first date/romantic place\" . this is your typical  Casual, Chill --- sorta like a fast food style restaurant place. The set up of this place is just really basic with small tables of 4's and seats along the bar area. 

Food: Bowl of udon was perfect for the chilly weather... but it was not OMG The BOMB!!!. 
I feel like the pRICE of the food was REALLY GOOD!!! Not costly and not that I would expect it to be for a chill place like this. 

I won't come back because it is not somewhere really closeby to where I live, hang out around, or work. I will also not think of this place if I want to enjoy a japanese bowl of noodles. But, I can see how this place may be a great choice for those that go to school, work, or live nearby. This could definitely be one of those casual restaurants you want to go to if you crave a bowl of noodles if you are nearby. 
But this is not for me."}
{"text":"*2.5 Stars*

The UDON is decent, as good as the frozen packs I get at Asian Markets which are about $1.00 per individual serving.  What I cannot replicate(YET) at home is the balance of the Soup Base, or at least I haven't been that dedicated to attempt.  I have BONITO Flakes in the cabinet waiting tho.

In terms of Takoyaki, my ranking at the moment is the following:

1. Street Stall @Tokyo Nakamise Dori (Japan)
2. Food Court Takoyaki @T&T Middlefield - TIED
2. Food Court Takoyaki @First Markham Place(Closed) - TIED
4. Manpuku
5. Guu (or similar)

I won't go in details but if you wish you can message me about this List-like List UTL(Unofficial Takoyaki List).  The ones I had this FIRST time, It was FRESH and HOT however it didn't hold the shape and the texture was too soft almost Gooey but better than Guu's Frozen Bagged Re-Fried.

The service was NICE as the ladies did refill our tea from time to time.  There is VALUE as well only if you do not like to PREP and CLEAN at home attempting to re-create a similar Udon item, especially the CURRY Flavour.

My friend pointed out that the Udon wasn't STEAMING hot, and he was right.  It was hot enough but NOT hot enough to make SLURPING the Udon necessary, which I always believe is part of the reason for the Noodle Slurping Culture(NSC) so to COOL the Noodle down.

The UDON here is a very Close Relative to the one I had at NARITA Airport in Tokyo.  I'm not even sure if that comment is good or bad, whatever..."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This was one of the only times in my whole life where Google Maps failed me.  
I walked up and down McCaul trying to find an entrance to this place.  It turns out that you have to enter the plaza that has a food court in it, and the entrance is inside.

Once I successfully located the restaurant, I met up with a friend, and a peculiar thing happened - there was a 30 minute wait, even though there was an empty table, and the entire upper section was dark and not being used :S.  The hostess then told us that we could sit outside of the restaurant at one of the food court tables, so we decided to do just that.  

I ordered the Hotate Rice - rice bowl topped w/ scallop and egg ($8.99).  Though it was pretty simple, I definitely enjoyed it.  The food in general seems to be pretty simple but good, and cheap (key word).

I definitely want to come back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"What took me so long to go here?  This place is a new favourite.  The curry udon with beef is the perfect rainy day meal, and satisfies each and every time, and is super comforting, like a hug, from your Nana.  Yes.  That nice.  Staff are always lovely.  Price is ridiculous cheap.  Looking forward to going back and trying the rat of the menu, because, really, what is not to love?"}
{"text":"pretty decent food. 
takoyaki was delicious. all are small portions and cheap prices. ambiance was nice. reasonable waiting time. did not try any ramen tho."}
{"text":"10/10 would come back to this place. The prices are very cheap and the quality is amazing. I wish I worked/lived closer - I can really see myself coming here everyday if I could.

For under $25, we were able to order two drinks, two mains, and two apps. That's including tax and tip!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I came here with high expectations from their high reviews and they did not disappoint!

I got a Yaki Onigri and a Ochazuke to go and the waitress kindly offered me a menu and cashed me out. I see that they have regulars that they know by name!

I waited maybe 10 mins for the food. She neatly packed the boxes and said \"thank you for waiting\" when she handed me the food -- how kind.

I didn't realize that the rice from the Ochazuke is the same rice from the Yaki Onigri. The soup is a mild roasted tea; I can go without it though :P

The rice, though quite oily, is packed with flavour and lots of soy sauce. There's flavour from the grill and the meat inside. I must admit, it's so flavourful at first I never had anything as tasty as this, but then I realized how salty it was because I was drinking so much water afterwards. Eat in moderation lol."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.The shop is small and they have a second level. Its also really hot with no AC. The workers are really nice and they also speak Japanese which unlocked my weabooness.  I ordered the pudding and chawan mushi. The pudding wasn't overly sweet but it had a hard layer at the bottom which made it seem like it was either not fresh or overcooked at the top (which is at the bottom when flipped to be served).  The chawan mushi was described to be a egg pudding with seafood under but its basiclly pouched egg and underneath is a seafood broth that includes a mushroom, scallop, fish cake and something else I forgot. On top it is drizzled with a bit of sesame oil. They were both really good in taste but the texture at the bottom o the pudding made me rate it less. The chawan mushi was really good though, you have to wait a while for them to make it and also wait more because it's really hot when it comes out. Overall the place was a nice and they also refilled your water without you asking which was nice service."}
{"text":"Overbangs for its buck. ($5.99 for a decent-portioned bowl of curry udon? Students rejoice!)

It wasn't anything memorable for the palate though, and I don't think I'd deliberately trek here if I ever have a craving for noodles."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this restaurant. I think there are some great dishes but none of them were the dishes I sampled.

Pros: good variety of food and a good price. 

Cons: service wasn't so good and the dishes I sampled were bland.  

Dishes I sampled:
-Takosen
-Yakionigiri
-Special menu: rice top with beef and an egg (very bland)

I will try this restaurant again and I will update my experience and rating based on both visits."}
{"text":"I love this place. The prices are fair and the food is delicious. Brings me back to Japan."}
{"text":"Aside from the takoyaki that takes 20 minutes to make (well-worth it though), I think this place is slightly overrated. The food is super cheap, so perhaps that makes up for it. You get what you pay for. The soup for the udon is also really good. I wouldn't consider it the best Japanese food I've ever tasted - perhaps I'm just not a Japanese food fan, esp that's not sushi - but it's pretty decent. The soup of each udon bowl is the best. The curry beef is not spicy at all, it's just \"curry\" for the sake of the curry texture. The takosen is sort of boring, but you absolutely cannot go without trying their takoyaki at least once."}
{"text":"I had ordered: 
niku udon (beef) $5.99
1/2 Takoyaki $4.99/6pcs

The udon has a beefy flavour but does not have strong seasoning. You taste a bit of it in the udon too. The meat was rough and dry. The dish came warm not hot.

The takoyaki pieces were pretty big but mostly dough. There was about 1.5 pieces of tako in it. The seasoning was all right. The waitress warned it would be a 20 minute wait however, we unexpectedly got it quickly.

Overall I was not full; like eating a snack.  disappointing.

The service was really quick."}
{"text":"Yummy food for a good price with having also good service but I feel they can do better"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite udon in the city. The noodles are AMAZING. The wakame udon is my fave. The service is quick and the taste is great. I really just can't say enough about the quality of the noodles. Plus it's really cheap."}
{"text":"Hidden in the Grange food court, Manpuku serves simple and cheap Japanese eats. Priced for the most part under $5, their udon are nice and chewy and based in a light dashi and topped with simple quintessential ingredients such as tofu or fishcakes. Other shareable tapas deriving a shoutout are the wasabi tako (wasabi octopus - very very strong wasabi taste), ochazuke (rice in a bowl of green tea dashi broth) and their takoyaki ($5 for 6!!)

Portions are generous and prices are very fair. Bring your friends and get ready to indulge in simple and homey Japanese food."}
{"text":"The food was cheap and yummy (boyfriend and I both got the beef curry udon, $5.99) and the servers were very nice, albeit a little frustrating. I told them about my onion allergy when ordering, but the food still came with onions and had to be redone twice."}
{"text":"This little restaurant located in a plaza near food court. The eel don and miso soup are salty. Other food  tastes average. Food is cheap compare to other Japanese place 15 per person."}
{"text":"Alert: this place is located inside the plaza near the food court!! 
You can get simple but delicious Japanese food at cheap price here at Manpuku.
When we arrived here, Friday night, it was packed. Tables are a bit too cramped together. Here, you eat fast and leave. I recommend ordering a main dish and an appetizer or two to share with others. Their takoyaki was the highlight of the meal. 

Overall, this is a good place if you want a quick bite and a cheap food (still authentic and tasty). There are plenty of other options you can choose in this area, however, I don't know if you would come back here....only if I crave for takoyaki."}
{"text":"I have bookmarked this place for a while now. Finally had the chance to check it out last week. Manpuku is located in a food court, I entered from McCaul street with the doors next to Grange Green Farms store. You have to walk a little into the food court to find it.

The store is not too big but it has a small bar table area, tables on main floor and then another small area on a higher floor (kind of their second floor). Service is generally prompt and polite, and you pay at the cashier. 

I ordered the niku udon noodles with beef and takoyaki. I wasn't really a fan of the niku udon, it was pretty bland and while takoyaki was very big in portion...the sauce they put on it was a bit too much, too salty. However, I guess it's a good option if you are just craving takoyaki and are on a budget. Portion is pretty big in comparison to other places. Oh and I was told by my friend and staff that takoyaki will take 20 minutes to make but I guess I was lucky because they gave it to me in 10 minutes. Just something to think about if you plan to get it. 

My friend ordered the ramen and chawan mushi and said it was fine. Again, not amazing but will do if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"Easy on the wallet without taking away the quality of the food.

Tucked away in Village by the Grange, conveniently near OCAD, it's a great location for a quick eat for students. 

I tried the kitsune udon (poached egg?) with the combo (salad and takosen). After reading upon the reviews from fellow Yelpers on the Takosen, I just had to try it. :)

The udon was cooked nicely. I liked the soup base, as I cleared it all away before the waitress took it away.

The service was friendly and attentive.

Once again, the takosen does take 20 mins to prepare. Honestly, I didn't think too much of it. the takoyaki didn't taste anymore different with the shrimp crackers.

I will definitely pop my head in from time to time for the udon."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ive been coming here for more than 3yrs now and their food still taste the same with friendly service!!"}
{"text":"After eyeing this restaurant on yelp for a couple of days, I had time to visit this place this weekend. First of all, the customer service is great, the servers are polite and apologetic when one of the dishes we ordered was late (and gave me a candy as a sorry, lol).

The seatings on the other hand can accommodate groups, pairs, and singles depending on how busy it is or you may have to wait. 

Now for the dishes we ordered, its 50/50.  Heres why: 

Unagi Don - the fish was soft and flavourful because of the sauce. It was served in a decent amount of rice but the garnishing of seaweed was a little too much for my liking as it overpowered the actual dish. Its a good dish regardless but I felt like ALSO that the sauce soaked the eel a little too much...if you like saucy then this might be for you, I wouldn't personally order it again. 

Shigure Don - this was an interesting dish as we never had it before. It reminded me of Gyu don because its made and looked the same, but this dish is slightly different in taste from one or two ingredients. There was a lot of meat and it was very tender. Very filling. My partner liked it. 

Curry udon - I surprisingly liked this one. It had a very soupy consistency, and not overwhelming while eating it. The udon was really soft and chewy and the beef was tender too. I recommend this dish. I would get it again.

Tofu cheesecake - tasted okay but it wasn't at all creamy and it was hard to cut through it (I mean, tofu and cheesecake are basically easy to slice but not this one ironically). I think its been sitting on their fridge for awhile. Its a shame though. It had potential. Wont order it again. 

Overall, it was an okay experience. This is something like a fast dining experience more than anything because the food was, afterall, made quick and easy. I would come back here to try their other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best place you'll ever find in downtown. Very reasonable price with very good quality of food, the portion is just right for a girl.

Their beef udon is the most popular, soup is perfect! 
Unagi don has a lot of unagi compared to other restaurants.
Takoyai doesn't have too much flour like most of the places that I've tried, but the octopus inside is still not as much as compared to the takoyai served in Asia.

Servers are always nice and patient!!!"}
{"text":"It is good place if you are looking for cheap homemade food but definitely not worth of travel. Everything here is lack of flavour. Takoyaki isn't too bad but it will serve on your table at the end of your meal. I tried most of their new menu as well and it was full of disappointment. Stay with their old menu.

Will only go back when I am looking for something light and cheap."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner of a food court, the restaurant itself is very small and cozy, so be sure to come at the beginning of the lunch/dinner period to get a good spot. Service was amazing, very attentive and super friendly the entire time.

My friend and I came here at around 11ish on a weekday and ordered a ramen and an udon. I wanted to have either the side dish of the takoyaki or the takosen, but unfortunately, the waitress informed us that those would take 20 minutes to be ready. It would have been nice to have that time requirement down on the menu too! I had 2 tuna onigiri for takeout, and it was $2.99 for 2 pieces, which is a nice deal!

The soup base for the udon wasn't too salty and there were lots of delicious toppings included with it too. The onigiri were very well done, but just a little too much rice in comparison with the tuna. Overall nice meal at a very reasonable price, and I'd definitely like to be back for their takoyaki, since it looked so good!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I was really hungry or if the price made it but the food here is so bomb. It's so nice to have a humble restaurant make really consistent and affordable food. The ongiri is sooooo good and I can't believe you get two well sized portions for $1.99. Truly a charming place with excellent food. The only shame is the location."}
{"text":"Cheap prices for what you are getting! I got the curry udon which was filling, but I think a little lacking in flavor. I recommend the tofu nuggets as an appetizer. Nice little restaurant for being in a food court."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with other OCAD students, it's busy around peak hours but fairly quiet sometimes during off-hours too. 

Food is great, servers are super friendly, they start to remember your regular order after a while (if you come as often as we do haha), seriously though, they're really (consistently) humble, kind, and hardworking people. Prices are fair, good for students especially!

The place is a bit small but its very warm and nice in the winter. A bit of a bummer cause there's no AC in the summer (from my experience) and it gets pretty hot but you can take your bowl and eat outside in the food court. 

Definitely recommend the curry udon or niku udon, and add on the combo and try the takosen!"}
{"text":"Had the Pork Udon, Takoyaki, Ice Mochi, and the cookie.

The Pork Udon wasn't really anything special but decent. The pork was a bit different then what I'm used to seeing in pork. 

The Takoyaki was pretty good. It seemed a bit heavy on the flour side but since I'm not a Takoyaki expert I can't say if that's good or bad.

The green tea ice mochi was really good. I particuarly enjoyed that dessert. The cookie was good as well, wasn't very soft (which I prefer) but it was different. It was white chocolate and some other ingredient.

The atmosphere was pretty good though it seemed a bit thin for a Thursday night. All in all, a good cheap meal that I will definitely be going back to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the back of the Grange food court and is small but has sit down spots and menu service. I've probably eaten here 15-20 times now over a few years and consider this my \"regular spot\" for many reasons. The service is always fast and efficient and friendly. The prices are amazing (so amazing that I often cover the entire bill for a group of friends because it's so reasonably priced). The food is extremely consistent in quality and flavour. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all delicious. My favourite is the niku udon with pork with extra green onion. This is basically a wonderful spot for homestyle Japanese food (not sushi) and I will continue to be a regular here :-) Also don't forget to check out the Japanese candies near the cash register."}
{"text":"I would never have gone or known about this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  I've seen this in the past when I've been in the building but I just thought is was another Japanese Sushi place.  I'd say the best thing about this place is the prices and the portions aren't bad as well.  It also feels like your in asia by they way they have set the place up.  I would definitely return when craving traditional cheap japanese food."}
{"text":"Fast service and great food at a great price. The takoyaki is the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We were greeted enthusiastically when we walked in, and got a table promptly since it wasn't very busy.  We ordered the tofu nuggets, takoyaki, kitsune udon, niku udon, and the manpuku ramen, which only came to a total of 28 bucks! The tofu nuggets were crispy and juicy on the inside, which had some peas and carrots in it. The kitsune undon had a sweet clear broth with springy noodles. The takoyaki was decent, but it wasn't crispy on the outside and i wished it had a little more sauce on it. The ramen had a heavy sesame taste to it, and the char sui was not as soft as it could have been.  The staff came to ask multiple times if we would like to refill our tea, and was very cheerful. Would strongly recommend this place, as well as the kitsune udon and tofu nuggets."}
{"text":"This is small eatery inside a food court. Great place to grab some quick eats for cheap. 

I bookmarked this eatery for some time now and finally got a chance to try it. I came with a friend during dinner hours. We stepped inside and we stood there for a few minutes. Several waiters walked by us but nobody approached us. We were confused because this place looked very casual, so I wasn't sure if we grabbed our own seats (there were several empty tables) or we wait to be seated.

We kept waiting but none of the servers approached us. We finally asked a server we are waiting for a table, and she asked how many, and we told her we needed a table for two. Finally we got a table. The initial impression wasn't great because of the lack of service. 

Food:
Manpuku ramen (2.5/5) : This was okay, I generally prefer going to a ramen restaurant to get ramen. But I was curious to try it here. It was very bland, and I would definitely not order this again. 

Yakionigiri (3.5/5): This was my favorite item. The rice was crisp on the outside. A nice side dish to add to any order.

Yakisoba (3/5) : This was alright. A bit too salty though.

Takoyaki (2/5): I was looking forward for this the most, but this was actually the most disappointing dish out of everything we ordered. It wayy too sticky and heavy.

Overall, the food was okay. But I didn't expect anything great given its a casual eatery with cheap prices. I think it is a decent place to get quick Japanese foods."}
{"text":"Oh yeah... definitely a fan... I can't wait to go back.  The food was delicious and great value.
Very affordable.  I had the scallop/egg/rice dish and it was delicious.  My girlfriend had the beef/egg/rice dish and she really liked it.   I liked mine better :)
The black sesame seed ice cream was good too... :)   the other appetizers looked good as well, unfortunately the portions are big so i didn't get to sample.. I'd suggest visiting with friends so you do family style and try more items..."}
{"text":"i havent done a review on manpuku ?! i love manpuku ! 

reasons why i love manpuku; 
1 . flavorful soup base . unlike other places .
2 . tender beef . not stringy or chewy or rubbery like other places .
3 . cheap !
4 . staffs are ... actually japanese ! :D
5 . niku udon . mmmmm

but there are also cons, that being; closing too early on weekdays & their takoyaki . its no biggie tho, my standard is sky high for takoyaki since my first time trying it was at osaka's most popular takoyaki joint, otako . takoyaki here is too bready . oh, and why do they not serve okonomiyaki ? :( in my opinion, get rid of takoyaki & replace it w okonomiyaki !!"}
{"text":"I felt so disappointed about Manpuku... Four-star rate was actually overrated!! It's true that the restaurant provides various kind of Japanese cuisine but the quality of food was not good. 
Some reviewers considered the prices were very cheap. But I don't think so because the portion was very very small! Can you imagine that there were only ten pieces of vegetable leafs in a salad? And the tayoyaki( actually I ordered Takosen, but the staff told me they have no senbei! So it became three pieces of flour balls) was almost full of dough with only a tiny octopus inside. And mayo sauce on the top was just a little. Yakionigiri was just two lighted fried rice balls with little tuna inside... 
Staff appeared to be too busy to listen to your requirements, atmosphere in the restaurant was in a messy..
I definitely would not go back... What a pity! I had expected for a long time!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese diner style restaurant. Their food is not fantastic but taste is exactly like Japan family-run restaurant.

The portions are pretty small but there's good variety, so it's better to go with friends so you can try lots of different things. My only complaint is that the grilled onigiri was way too salty. Everything else is good, +1 star for that comforting homemade taste."}
{"text":"Yet another tasty and very affordable joint located inside the Grange. Like most of the other great eats inside this hidden food court, this place is an institution for many OCAD students and alumni.

You won't be eating fancy sashimi or sushi here but they offer many Japanese comfort dishes like udon and curry rice dishes at unbelievable prices!

With amazing prices, fast service and delicious comfort food this place hits all the rights spots for a great lunch or a light dinner."}
{"text":"First time seekers will definitely have trouble finding this wonderful hidden gem but it's located deep inside The Grange past the food court area but you could also enter from the side entrance along McCaul St.!

The very first thing that I would like to mention about this place is that it is incredibly CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! It won't hurt your poor little wallet like all of the other noodle joints around the area. Everything is under $10, which is an A+ on my part!

It's a great place to get a quick fix of yummy yummy goodness. If you don't like udon or aren't in the mood for noodles, don't fret! They also have a variety of delicious rice bowls as well! 

Their menu is simple and tiny but don't expect them to have any sushi. This restaurant serves authentic little Japanese eats that aren't fishy. *bah boom tshhing*

Anyways, my favourites on the menu would be the curry udon or curry don. The curry is not your standard curry. It's not like Thai or Indian curry, it is a very subtle tasting curry that is not spicy at all. I'm not a fan of spicy things so Japanese curry definitely hits the spot but the flavour profile is definitely there. It's unique because one would think \"CURRY? UDON? SOUP? WHAT?\", trust me, it works so well together and you'll be dying to go back for more of this yummy yummy goodness.

The Hotate rice at Manpuku is also to die for! It's one of my favourite rice bowls ever. I mean who doesn't love eating a delicious bowl of steamed rice with scallops and eggs covered in delicious tonkatsu-like sauce and mayonnaise.

I am not going to lie, I am a huge takoyaki fanatic and I am on a mission in finding the best and perfect tasting takoyaki balls in Toronto but quite sadly, the takoyaki balls at Manpuku aren't the best. They're alright. The flavour isn't quite there but for $4.99, it ain't too bad. I just wish they would work on perfecting the taste of their takoyaki balls.

Overall, if you're around the area looking for something to eat, definitely give this litte hidden gem a try."}
{"text":"Went to Manpuku with a friend of mine, who happens to be a bit of an expert on Japanese eateries in TO. Like it quite a bit, would definitely go back.

Place itself is quite small and located right next to the food court. There is no AC, so in the summer it can get pretty warm.

The best thing about this place is affordable menu. Most of dishes under $10 so you can actually order several ones to share, much like Izakaya style pub. If you expecting Sushi this is not a place for you, they don't serve it there.  

Quality of the food is quite good. Takoyaki balls are one of my favourites. You have to order it right away as it takes them 15 min to prepare those. Udon noodles in broth is another can't miss selection, I happened to like curry flavour. 

I was expected Sapporo on draft but all they had was bottles."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and I love how no-fuss and practical the food is here. 
It is a bit difficult to find if you have never been inside the Village by the Grange building, and it's also at the furthermost corner of the foodcourt when you enter from the Dundas street entrance. However, it is situated in an area that allows you to see the conservatory-type feature of that part of the good court, lots of warm sun-light comes through in the summer months.
Yup, most of the dishes are also reasonably priced so I could pair an appetizer and a main dish and get a filling meal from it without having to splurge.
The first time I came here I had the YakiOnigiri which are the pan-fried versions of the Onigiri on the menu. The YakiOnigiri comes with two flavor accompaniments, either soy sauce or miso paste. I picked on of each and I liked the taste of the miso more and it went well with the crispiness of the seared rice. Because it was mostly rice, it was filling enough.
On the second trip I got a bigger meal so I won't get hungry while sitting inside the cinema so I had a Curry Udon (with the beef curry option) and the tofu nuggets appetizer (nugget shaped semi-thick tofu slices glazed with a sweet sauce). 
The broth for the udon was a bit thin but still flavorful but the more I stirred the noodles around, the more the beef and potato curry kind of disintegrated into the broth, but the whole bowl still filled me up. The flavor of the sauce on the nuggets also paired well with the noodles.
I took my time savoring both dishes and felt a some degree of comfort half-way through the meal.
There are other dishes on the menu that have got my taste-buds going, particularly the Ochazuke and the Takoyaki so I definitely be going back there some soon."}
{"text":"Manpuku is a tiny eatery right across from OCAD mostly catering to students around the area. The food is yummy and cheap! 

BEEF CURRY RICE 4/5
I love how their curry is a bit spicy - it's rare that Japanese curries are on the spicy end. This is both sweet and spicy. Yummy! :)

TAKOYAKI 4/5 
Takes 20 mins to make so order early if you're planning to get it. Very fresh and steamy hot when it's served. 

We were way too full so we didn't order any desserts :( 
Will visit again!"}
{"text":"A co-worker mentioned this place awhile ago and thank goodness, I finally got a chance to go.

I have to admit, discovering this place, tucked into a non-descript food court off McCaul and across OCAD was like finding buried treasure. Who knew this was here? Okay, maybe OCAD students.

In the past,  I have walked down this street so many times but never noticed this was here. If I hadn't been following instructions from my little blue dot on my iphone. (Yeah, that's right) I think I still would have missed it.

It's a modern eatery surrounded by a world of familiar cheap eat booths from every corner of the globe. Upon entering their space, you are immediately welcomed in Japanese. After reading the menu and reviews, I ordered the shigure don. A bowl of white rice topped with thin slices of beef and onion in a special sauce I like to call yum. 

The low down: a variety of noodle and rice dishes as well as desserts.  Priced between $2-$7 per item.  They are licensed so you can get your drink  on with Japanese alcohol and sake. Seating is available for individuals and groups. 

Service is extremely fast and friendly. Clean! Price is inexpensive. Washroom is on the ground floor (they get a star just for that!)"}
{"text":"I went to Manpuku on two occasions and their service is friendly and food comes very quickly! Their restaurant motto is cheap and great tasting Japanese food, and this is certainly the case. 

The shigure don (6.49$) has a generous portion of beef and onions on a bed of rice. The sauce is watered down and beef is slightly dry, but this has such a great value. 

Their oden (2.99$) has a sweet and acidic soup base which I was not a fan of. It is served with fish cake and a large radish.

The restaurant reminds me of an Izakaya and they also have counter seating around the kitchen. Definitely a great pick for a wallet-friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was so hungry when I finally found this place hidden in a food court.  The address is correct, it just doesn't look like the entrance to a food court.  This is a different style of ramen with clear broth.  The noodles were perfect al dente.  The takoyaki was excellent.  The curry don tastes like asian comfort food, helps me recall my roots."}
{"text":"Walked by at least three times before finally finding the restaurant. It is located inside the foodcourt across form OCAD. The price is really good for downtown Toronto and food is tasty as well. My personal favourites are the udon bowls and takoyaki.

The service is sometimes slow, depending on the availability of the dishes you order. One time I had to wait 15~20 minutes for takoyaki. The ventilation of the restaurant is not very good and thus it gets really stuffy at times. 

This is one of the few Japanese comfort food restaurants in Toronto. Would return next time I am crazing octopus balls."}
{"text":"This place is both cheap with good tasting food. $5.99 for a ton don, well worth the price. There was a good ratio of pork to rice and the portion itself is reasonable. The pork isn't too dry, but the rice does tend to be a little on the soggier side. Got the don in a combo with an extra $2 for a salad and soup. Both were good quality. The salad had fresh leaves and a nice tangy dressing. The miso soup was not bland in flavour either. 

The place itself is a little small so be prepared to be a little crowded. But overall I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"You get what you pay. 

Service: We were told to sit anywhere, only to be moved to a different table after settling in.

Food: We ordered takoyaki, ramen and udon. We had to dissect the takoyaki and dig through the dough to find a tiny piece of squid tentacle. The ramen and udon were salty. Probably msg soup. 

Overall: Very affordable but not very enjoyable. Again, you get what you pay."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive eatery with student pricing style. But food is what matters. Perhaps I should give another chance here but I've had way better udon. Just on a cold day I really appreciated the hot tea but c'mon... I really wanted to give this place a chance after hearing rave reviews but not to my standard."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here, it's because I've forgotten what it tasted like the previous time. Sort of like AYCE when you say you'll never do it again. 

The prices are decent here but the food just doesn't cut it. Especially with all the ramen shops close by (Sansotei, Tohoubken, Kinton), you'll only end up here if you want to save a few bucks. But will it give you that satisfying flavourful, richness broth you get at the other places, not really. So I say, spend a $1-2 more and get yourself some good ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon.  Service is friendly enough and the prices are great, but there's just nothing exceptional about the food."}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend and it was amazing just like the reviews made it out to be

Food: 4/5 - Good tasting food, nothing too special but it is a good meal overall.
Price: 5/5 - Price is by far the biggest selling point of Manpuku. I think over 90% of the menu is under $10, most of it being around the $4-6 range. Totally worth it for the food that you are getting
Service: 4.5/5 - Friendly staff and the order was served less than 5 minutes after ordering, so very quick!

Everything on the menu was super cheap and for what you were getting, it is a really good deal (especially downtown!). I ordered the Niku Udon (beef + udon in soup) and it was really good. There was a decent portion of udon and beef, and a bowl full of delicious but not too salty soup. The beef was also full of flavour and nice and soft, which is great because often it is overcooked."}
{"text":"It was a little bit difficult to find the first time we were here, as the restaurant is inside a mall's food court. They actually has their own sitting places with not a lot of capacity, but you can always eat out at the mall lol

We were amazed by the food's inexpensiveness, even though we already know this place is 1 $ sign. I ordered a tasty 7.5$ rice curry and we shared a Takoyaki dish (6$, I think).

Food is more about daily Japanese dishes, nothing fancy. They also have various types of Japanese snack, if that's your thing.

I will definitely be coming back to try more things. It's so easy to experiment stuff when the food is tasty yet the price is cheap."}
{"text":"Manpuku never disappoints. Good food with great prices. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced with reasonable portions (a bit on the smaller end of the spectrum) but definitely worth its price. 

Came here yesterday on one of the hottest days of the week. Unfortunately, there was little to no air conditioning but we were fine with it as the food was just phenomenal for its price. 

I decided to go with the yakionigiri which is some pan fried onigiri in miso. The onigiri had a bit of meat inside as well. It came in two and was not bad. We also ordered the takoyaki which came in 6. The waitress had let us know while we were ordering that it'd be a 20 minute wait for the takoyaki. We didn't mind and it was definitely worth it! Lots of takoyaki sauce with delicious kewpie mayonnaise. 

My companion also ordered the kitsune udon which was delicious and would be perfect on a more chill day as the soup is quite warming. 

Upon entering the restaurant, we were given a choice of water or tea. Wonderful staff. Have been here many times before and will definitely be returning many times to come. 

The place offers no wi-fi and the lighting is pretty yellow but they do serve beers as well. Great place."}
{"text":"Order a beef don and beef was dry, bland and tasteless. Was advised Takoyaki takes 20 minutes to make.?!

Overpriced and below par"}
{"text":"Manpuku is my ultimate go-to for quick, cheap and delicious food - and I am so thankful this restaurant is a one minute walk from my office! 

This place is definitely a hidden gem, literally hidden somewhere in the back of the Village by the Grange food court. Quality of food is great,  price is so amazing, and the service  is fantastic ( your food is out no more than 10 minutes after the order is in)

My ultimate fav are the Curry Don and Curry Udon. The curry is so good, it is almost addictive ( trust me many of my friends whom I've introduced the curry to, are now addicted to it!) 

I have also tried their takoyaki in the past,  and I thought they were alright,  especially at that price point! However, most of the times I usually just end up ordering the Curry Don/Udon! 

I'd definitely reco this place to anyone in the area -such a great place for when you're craving Japanese food and don't really want to pay the big bucks!"}
{"text":"it's good place but not so bad or not so good. 
I used be OCAD student for 6 years, and i missed their old strong flavours, big portions. bring back the old menu! i thought the restaurant would improve better but they didn't do much improvement in later years. every summer, staffs always says \"sorry there is no A/C\".
i was disappointed than i expected when i ordered a beef udon soup. i was expecting to eat strong flavour, varied small ingredients and big portion. :( 
only few plates are good. 
anyway it's good for the fast food for people who are rushing."}
{"text":"Not that impressed by the food here.  I love takoyaki, so I try it whenever I can. The takoyaki started out promising at first glance.  They are pretty large with the right sauce and toppings, but then you cut into it and find out it's 95% dough. You have to really search for that little tiny piece of octopus in each one to taste something different. Also, it wasn't really seasoned inside, relying mainly on the sauce to give it flavour. There has got to be better takoyaki in TO, this can't be the best there is. 

My friend got the shigure don. The portion was generous but it was literally a pile of shaved beef on rice. No slice of onion or drop of sauce in sight.  It just seemed a little dry to me. The winner of the night was the tofu nuggets. They were a step up, with a great crispiness outside with a good texture on the inside. But 1 out of 3 isn't a good score......"}
{"text":"Great little eatery. Came here for lunch with my boyfriend. Had their takoyaki, beef, and scallop Don. The servers were friendly, the price was modest, and the food was pretty good. Would definitely come back here to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Located and tucked in Village on The Grange, Manpuku may be a over-looked restaurant.  You're greeted with a smile right when you walk in.  

I ordered a curry udon with pork (which was absolutely cheap for about $5.99).  If you add two bucks on top of that, you get a \"combo\" where you get a choice of two out of chips, salad, soup, or takosen.  I decided to opt for the salad and takosen.  The salad had a bit of crunch to it - so it was pretty interesting.  The curry udon was delicious -- I was craving Japanese curry -- so it was nice and filling.  There was quite an amount of pork.  My friend ordered the curry udon with vegetables -- the vegetables were disappointing as they were just mixed frozen vegetables.

My favourite was actually the takosen (a takoyaki between two senbei).  The takoyaki was slightly softer than my usual takoyaki, but it was a nice touch to the end of my meal.

Keep in mind that if you come here, you would have to wait a bit for the takoyaki/takosen - takes about 20 minutes or so for it to come to your table.

All in all - it was very worth the meal that I had.  I was really full, and the food was delicious for a lunch time meal!  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I got the Kake Udon and Chawan Mushi. Im not the biggest fan of udon but this was pretty good for the price. The chawan was new to me. It's steamed egg and seafood (so basically seaweed and fish mixed up in scrambled-egg like pudding) and it's a pretty good little dish. The prices of everything on the menu are so cheap and the food is well worth. Would definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located inside of a food court, but we didn't expect the quality would be this good.  Not to mention price is very affordable.  We ordered around 10 dishes and they came out lightning fast.  I recommend this place for a casual dining with friends."}
{"text":"Little restaurant across from OCAD.  Love the cheap menu with tons of selection.  My favourites were kitsune udon for $4.49 & ochazuke for $3.99.  Alcohol list was cheaper than other jap restaurant & food was simple & good.  Reminds me of shops in the streets of Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Manpuku is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Toronto. It's not one of those fancy Japanese restaurants, but it feels that the food is made with love. This place reminds me of the small family owned restaurants in Japan, which I enjoyed so much when I traveled there. My personal favourite at Manpuku is their Curry Don with beef. It's really delicious! The curry is delicious and the meat is tasty. I'm always happy to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Affordable and tasty food that yields good value. It's a bit hidden in the plaza directly across from OCAD but a great find.

I love their udon noodles and I always get their takoyakis. You have to wait 20 mins for it but it's totally worth it because they're made fresh unlike other places that already have them premade.

Would've given it 5 stars if they had more selection"}
{"text":"A very nice and cheap place to go to (relatively)! This is right across from the OCAD building on McCaul Street - in the food court with all the other cheap places too. What I enjoy out of this is that most of the meals here are about 7-8 dollars before tax - pretty good and cheap place for students and on-budget patrons.

Two times I have been here I got the udon with seaweed and the pan fried ramen. Both for the price you pay for I would find is acceptable - though not too meaty, their noodles made are up to par.

The downside is that the restaurant does get hot really easily ... bad circulation overall and though they have fans - there is a tendency to be sweating as you are eating. I would definitely recommend to give it a try for whoever that is in the area."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has a 4/5 review, because the food that I got during my visit wasn't good at all. 

Environment:
This restaurant is pretty hard to find, it's a small store front located inside a food court near OCAD, so you won't bump into this place unless you're specifically looking for it or you frequent the nearby area. 
The inside of the restaurant is pretty cramped, most suitable for groups of 2-4, however, they do take reservation for high traffic times, such as weekend dinner. I would say the restaurant is moderately clean, but I can definitely smell the cleaning supply. Don't bother trying to sit outside, the dining environment is way worse. 

Food:
First of all, it's really confusing to keep track of the menu. They have a main menu, which is the one you can find off of their website, then there's a secondary menu with also main dishes, on top of that, there is also some featured items on the wall. All of these makes it pretty confusing to keep track of their offerings and make your decision. It's personally not a big deal for me, but my friends found it kinda confusing.
I ordered the takoyaki (takes 20 mins to prepare) and the beef rice bowl. The takoyaki was horrible, even worse than some sub-par AYCE sushi restaurants, definitely not worth the wait. The batter was too thick with no good texture nor flavour. The beef rice bowl wasn't good either, because the beef was too lean, which made it super dry and tough, thus making it difficult to chew. The flavour of the beef wasn't that good either and there was not enough sauce/juice from the meat for me to finish my rice with.  

Service:
There was barely any service because they are kinda understaffed so it was rather difficult to get hold of a server walking by. Also, you have to walk up to the cashier to pay."}
{"text":"It's good and affordable. Takoyaki was okay, the flavour satisfies my craving and it's cheaper than most places, so keeping that in mind quality is on par with cost. They have some other dishes that are pretty good, we had the minced meat in rice, and cold udon salad too. Everything was pretty good and prices are really good for a quick snack. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a solid choice when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I think I've walked through the food court in which Manpuku resides dozens of times and yet it's never occurred to me to stop inside the restaurant. What a tragic mistake I've been making.

We arrived just before noon on a weekday and the place was almost empty. I initially decided to order the Hayashi Rice, as the picture in the menu looked seriously appetizing, but a few minutes later I was told that this item wasn't available. Second choice it is!

I decided to get the Curry Don (\"the basic donburi rice bowl topped with a Japanese blend of beef curry sauce\"). I'm so glad I ordered this because it was seriously delicious. The curry sauce is addictively rich and flavorful, while the copious chunks of beef and potatoes confirm the dish's place as a comforting, filling meal. It's not really spicy, but the accompanying shaker of Japanese spices adds a perfect level of heat.

And all that for $6.99! When we got our final bill, it was basically the cost of a single, terrible burrito at Chipotle. Insane. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"For cheap eats, come here! Their food is pretty delicious too as it'll definitely hit the spot and save your wallet."}
{"text":"- I have tried:
     + yakionigiri: it is more like a fried rice ball, nothing special but it was a good appetizer 
     + curry udon: the flavour was strong, soup was a bit more dense than other udon, a bit salty but overall was good 
     + niku udon: this dish was really good, the soup was flavourful and not as salty as curry udon
     + Takoyaki: the sauce and everything was good, only complaint is they gave too much dough instead of octopus. But it was only $4.99 so I guess it makes sense that they cut off on the meat
     + Hotate rice: it was a rice bowl with scallops and eggs. They over-put much sauce, i think it's because they gave more rice than eggs so they wanna balanced out the flavour. But it was still delicious.
     + Unagi don: this dish was the most expensive, but i think it's the best one of all (I also really like niku udon as well). It's like eel cooked with teriyaki sauce and rice, really enjoyed it.
     + I wanted to try their Manpuku ramen as well but it was sold out :( will definitely try it next time
- Portion: was enough compared to the prices, I needed two dishes to be completely full.
- Price: reasonable. It would be so much cheaper (less than $10/person) if you go with group of friends. If you go with one or two people, you may have to pay more than $10 to be full.
- The place was so small, we have to wait for like 15 minutes for a table of five. They did not claim to take reservation on Yelp but apparently I saw they reserved tables for other people, so I guess you have to call in.
- Would highly recommend this place if you want cheap Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place is honestly amazing!! Might be one of my new favorite places.

The food is awesome and inexpensive. We got the hotate rice ($8.99),  shigure don ($6.49), unagi don ($11.99), and the the takoyaki ($4.99). All were delicious with good portion sizes - although the unagi don is fairly expensive, it was so good and came with the biggest piece of eel i have ever seen! We both felt full after the meal but headed to the waffle place next door for some dessert! 

The actual place had a very authentic Japanese feel and felt very welcoming. I would not recommend it for large groups, unless you are ok with eating outside at food court area. Seating area is a bit crowded but not a big deal. This place is the definition of 5 stars in my book and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant. Food, service, and prices were good! We ordered the beef udon and the beef curry udon and both were pretty good. Personally, I liked the beef curry udon more. 

Try their takosen! It's basically takoyaki sandwiched between 2 Japanese crackers. I really enjoyed it and would definitely come back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Inexpensive Udon and Donburi bowls served counter side.  Dishes are always piping hot and tasty with minimal waiting time.

Perfect lunch time treat.  And they also serve Beer!"}
{"text":"Manpuku is a student's godsend.

It's across the street if you come from OCAD, and a 15 min. walk from UofT. You're welcomed by a cozy, family restaurant environment and chill music in the background (it was Nujabes for a bit).

The food is filling and you can get neat little appetizers for as little as $2 apiece. This makes the menu very customizable. One of my favourites is the niku udon, which always has a good amount of beef, a rich soup base, and authentic-tasting noodles. I usually pair these noodles with a salad + takosen combo for a little extra $. 

Manpuku is a welcome change from the sushi/ramen variety common in Toronto, aiming instead for Japanese \"comfort food\"--the kind that's served in fast food joints across Japan. (Don't confuse Japanese fast food with the American kind, though--the former still feels relatively home-cooked, at least to a foreigner like me.) Like others have said, it's food \"made with love.\"

Service is friendly and speedy. Best of all, Manpuku comforts the wallet too--prices are a steal for relatively authentic food."}
{"text":"So I literally had Manpuku 2 hours ago and I am so glad that it meet expectations. I had the Niku Udon combo with soup and Takosen. The meal only cost me 10 dollars including a 20% tip for the incredibly friendly and helpful waitresses. 

The niku udon itself was quite pleasant, the broth was very savory and hot and I actually burned my tongue a little cause I was eating with so much enthusiasm. The meat I had was beef and it was a little strange, I am not sure whether it's because it's not top quality beef or whether it was stewed for a long time but it wasn't unpleasant, either way with the price I'm not complaining. The udon noodles themselves were perfectly cooked, and there was a good amount of them in the large bowl. 

The miso soup was quite average, maybe a little worst than your average miso soup but it was piping hot as well and very filling on a cold evening like the one I just had to endure. The Takosen though was another star of the show, basically it was just 3 takoyaki no senbei, not a problem. It took a while to cook but it felt good knowing that they were fresh. They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with a decent amount of small octopus pieces and perfectly flavored with okonomiyaki sauce and a bit of mayo.

Tl;dr Amazing food for the price, must try the takoyaki, friendly Japanese waitresses"}
{"text":"Most authentic Japanese restaurant. From the people who work there (they are all actual Japanese yay!) to the food, everything tastes soo authentic, delicous, and homemade.

The price for the quality of the food is amazing, and the service is always fantastic and the servers are soo considerate and nice. If you come here, the udon and takoyaki are a must have!"}
{"text":"Manpuku is in a food court by the way. I got lost first time coming to here. Anyways..

ENVIRONMENT:

Me and my friend came to this place at lunch time around 11am. When we came in it was empty but by noon the restaurant was packed with people!

FOOD:

Me and my friend ordered:
Beef curry Udon
Sho-yu (soy sauce) Ramen
Takoyaki (Octopus ball)

First of all, curry Udon was just brilliant, the soup was mixed with appropriate amount of curry so that even though the soup tasted like curry, it still was soup. If there were more curry the soup would become too thick. If there were less curry the soup would not taste well. Definitely a recommendation for those who likes to eat curry or Udon.

Second of all, Sho-yu Ramen really tasted like Sho-yu Ramen! It did not tasted like instant noodle soup. It was just original and authentic. Definitely would recommend this.

Last of all, I would recommend all of you who go Manpuku to order their Takoyaki. Their Takoyaki was simply the most authentic and tasty Takoyaki ever. Instead of just 1 tiny octopus in Takoyaki, their Takoyaki has many optopus. I lived in Japan for 5 years before and when I ate their Takoyaki, it felt like I was back there. I'd get this every time I go. 

PRICE:
Curry Udon was very cheap, it was $5.99 and it was full-filling.
Sho-yu Ramen was cheap, it was $7.99.
Takoyaki was cheap as well, it was $4.99 and it is truly authentic.
If you are just in hurry during lunch time or dinner time, then definitely just getting their Udon or Ramen will make you full."}
{"text":"Would recommend takoyaki, green tea mochi and onigiri there. Udon is a little bit plain. Fair price though."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm cold and hungry with only a fiver and two loonies in my pocket. 

Although it's in a depressingly lit and cramped food court, they managed to carve out a space that feels warm and cheery. Service is brisk and no-frills, but friendly. 

I usually choose from any of the udon selection because of their satisfying prices and tastiness (I'm especially partial to the kitsune), but if I'm feeling like I need something more hearty, I go for the salami rice curry. I always top if off with pudding for dessert if it's available. Simple but supremely comforting. 

I also recommend the jumbo inari, onigiri, imo-mochi, and ochazuke."}
{"text":"Great little (not that little) Japanese noodle/izakaya place.  

Friendly staff, tasty food, reasonable prices (as most of the positive reviews below mention).

My lunch today:

NIKU UDON (beef) ($6) which was quite filling and really good.  Decent amount of beef.

TAKOYAKI ($5).  They are literally amazeballs!  As others have stated, takes about 20 minutes to get them, so order right when you arrive if you want them for a lunch.  My friend pointed out it would be interesting to try them with the sauce on the side instead of spread over top, to see what they're like crispy.  I will be attempting this in the future.

ASAHI BLACK ($6).  Not many places carry this interesting beer, so I tend to order it anytime I'm here.  It's a bit expensive for a bottle, at $6, but it's a treat.

It's in a pretty convenient location too, very close to St Patrick station.

I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Man, it's tough these days finding a place that's not fast food, yet can fill you up for lunch for less than $7, AND it's delicious! Yup, this place fits the three criteria.

I'm normally more of a ramen person than an udon person, but I've been wanting to try this place for a while after reading some of the reviews here. I tried the niku udon, and I wholeheartedly agree that the udon is one of the best I've had, especially for a dish that's only $5.99. For that price I can't argue much with the beef, which I have to say wasn't the best and felt like something you find in the frozen department.

Service was brilliant, with me being fully attended to the whole time I was here. Maybe a small downfall was that I never got any tea refills, but I wasn't thirsty at all in the end, which would mean no MSG was added to my food. Yup, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend when I visited Toronto, and had a great time. The menu has a plethora of dishes to choose from. The staff was kind and helpful. I thought that the takoyaki and pork rice were great. However, their onigiri had too much rice, while lacking meat and flavor. For the low price, this place is superb!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get a quick fix of very casual Japanese food. Lower than average pricing may the most important point to eat here. (About $10 per main/bowl)."}
{"text":"I've heard of this very budget friendly eatery in the past but only made my way to try it a few weeks back and it didn't disappoint. There's nothing fancy here but it was good and made me feel like I was on vacation in Japan. 

The udon is on the softer side for me but still good. The shirataki noodle substitution was great because it's zero calories and not many restaurants offer it. All the dishes are pretty basic and come out pretty quickly except for the takoyaki. I'm not a big fan of takoyaki but this one tasted like the ones I've tried in Osaka, that's good enough for me. The tofu nuggets are surprisingly really good. 

The service was good. The servers are all very nice and seem to work very well together, I was at the till paying and when I looked up from the card machine, the server changed but everything still went smoothly."}
{"text":"I hope guu is way better than this. anyone who is willing to wait 2 hours to eat anything even close to this is in for a disappointment.

I ordered the niku udon (the standard beef one) and the octopus appetizer everyone raves about. The beef in the soup was rubbery. broth lackluster. nothing special. The octopus appetizer is kinda gross. deep fried with some japanese mayo thats a tad too zippy. not worth waiting the 20 minute prep time.

One of my friends had the curry udon and said it was really good, so maybe thats worth trying.

I will say, pretty cheap (most soups run around $5-6) and you get plenty."}
{"text":"Only saving grace is the price. It's a cheap snack joint. Don't expect much.
And whatever you do, do not order the takoyaki. They make it on the spot and it takes a good 10-15minutes. And it's horrible. I can make them better at home.
And none of these kids are professional cooks. All their menu are basically re-heated instant foods.
Bottom line: go there if  you want to snack on udon, which is about the only thing edible. But remember it's still a packaged udon noodle boiled in powder soup."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find but man was the food good. One of the most reasonable prices for what you pay they give a lot of food. I had the udon soup it was probably the best soup I have ever tasted in my life. They ran out of a lot of stock they need to work more on that so that more of their menu items are valuable to eat but the food I tasted was absolutely delicious. The broth had the right consistency not to salty which I like. The noodles tasted awesome I recommend people try this place it is inside a mall at McCaul st"}
{"text":"Cheap Japanese food that's small in portion and mediocre in quality, I got the hotate rice and I wasn't too impressed, the rice was dry including the scrambled eggs, there was suppose to be some scallops but I barely got any, should have asked for more teriyaki sauce

My mom got the beef udon, it was alright nothing special, at last we got the octopus balls, totally not worth it, there was barely any octopus and flavorless...quite disappointed, this place used to be good"}
{"text":"When I get nostalgic about my travels to Japan, I like to come to this small, casual, and very authentic spot. From the cute logo (a daruma doll -- you are supposed to colour in one eye and make a wish, and colour in the other eye when it comes true) to the thoughtful service, it's really like being in Japan. 

The menu is simple. I always get the udon noodles, although at some point I will try the yam noodles. $4.50 for a big bowl of kitsune udon? That's cheaper than most take-out/fast-food places, and so much more satisfying! The noodle dishes are pretty standard (light, not overpowering broth, fish cakes, green onion + whatever topping you want), but if it ain't broke... A standout for me was the yaki onigiri ($3.50). One order includes 2 triangle shaped onigiri stuffed with tuna. I've eaten lots of onigiri before, but this was the first time I've had it grilled and it's delicious! All nice and crispy outside with sesame seeds and soft and warm inside. 

Servers make sure your tea/water cup never goes empty. Just like in Japan, when they bring your entree, they also bring your bill. This is nice, so you can stay as long as you want, but when you're ready to pay you don't need to flag down your server. (If you order dessert, they'll just take the old bill away and make a new one). Other than the takoyaki, food is brought out pretty fast, which makes this a good place for a quick lunch as well."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the food court beside the OCAD and AGO. Great for a quite bite and a good variety to choose from. The portion size is quite generous considering it is reasonable priced. I have upgraded my dish to combo, and had takoyaki as side dish. The squid flavour did not come through at all which is disappointing, see other people had raving reviews of them so i had high expectation. My friend is very adventurous he took the nato as a side dish which he found the texture and the taste is not appealing. Nato is not for everyone, personally think they make a wonderful snack packed with good bacteria for the gut flora. Gyuudon I had is very flavourful, some pieces of beef are very lean, think the flavour of the dish is rendered from the fat, the fattier the better. Would be back to try the Udon"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem near OCAD, I love their takoyaki and their curry udon! The space is small but still seats quite a bit of people, only thing to note is that their takoyaki definitely takes some time, so if you're hungry order something else first! The price is definitely one of the best things about this place, so affordable!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when Manpuku opened up in Village of the Grange in my neighborhood. It's a nicely decorated place - clean and spacious, and the menu is CHEAP. For $4, I can get a steaming bowl of udon noodle soup. For $2 more, I could pick 2 things from the following options: salad, miso soup, takosen (which is Takoyaki sandwiched between 2 shrimp rice crackers), and chips. I always pick either salad or soup, and the takosen. I am addicted to the takosen! There's something perfect about the combination of a hot octopus ball and crispy light shrimp crackers. So much so that I had takoyaki at another restaurant, but when I realized they didn't have shrimp crackers, I bagged it to go and bought shrimp crackers from manpuku just to eat with them. And they were infinitely improved. :)

I went again recently and found that they have added to their menu where you can substitute the udon noodle with another noodle that is supposedly 0 calories. Not sure how that is possible, but it definitely made me feel better about straying off my grapefruit diet. The noodle is white and chewy, and actually quite tasty. My friend I was dining with said they offer that in Japan too (she used to travel there a lot on business), so it's still authentic japanese food.

So I left there having only spent $8 on a bowl of low calorie noodles ($4 + $2 noodle substitution), salad, and takosen ($2 combo option).

Another note - the takosen does take 20 minutes from the time you order, but I don't mind since I just start eating everything else and it comes well before you are done your meal, and I know it's fresh!

Manpuku is definitely a staple for japanese udon noodles that's light on your wallet. The curry is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, attracted by the cheap prices claimed by Yelpers. This place is hard to find, we later realized it was inside the OCAD food court.

We got a variety of snack food: 2 types of takoyaki, fish cakes, and onigiri. The takoyaki takes awhile to cook as it is made fresh, the other dishes came quickly though. 

The service was not bad, sometimes they took a long time to come around. They didn't give us utensils or plates until we asked. 

In total it ended up being about $10/person, not bad at all. The takoyaki ends up being quite filling between two people. 

Next time I'd like to try the noodle dishes seeing as the portion sizes are quite large."}
{"text":"I am in love. I was at first skeptical when I first found this restaurant on yelp...with those prices, WHAT can you get in Downtown Toronto?
First off, this is tucked away in a building that comprises of a food court near OCAD. It wasn't easy to find but definitely a hidden gem. Tables are mostly for 2. We came at 6:30 on a weeknight and got a seat immediately.
The prices are insanely cheap, for a limited topping udon, you can get away with under $5 including tax & tip. They have a variety of Japanese staples like curry, oden and gyu don. (Their physical menus are kinda gross so you might be better off looking at what you might want on yelp if you are a germaphobe)
My sister and I ordered the gyu don and a niku udon with beef. The soup of my udon is light but flavourful, everything you'd expect at a Japanese family restaurant. The beef seemed slightly over cooked but still very good quality. Both portions are decent, but I regret not trying their sides, since there was quite a bit to choose from. The food itself isn't the best thing I've ever had, but given the prices, I came with zero expectations.
Staff was courteous, refills water promptly, checks how the bill should be split...just the usual.
I would 100% recommend and return...probably not if it's out of the way since the food isn't all THAT special. I can however, easily see myself coming here 3 days a week for lunch if I work walking distance from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I headed to Manpuku in hopes of an inexpensive, delicious dinner and I was not disappointed! I would definitely recommend trying the pudding at the end of your meal. I went with three others so we got a few dishes - curry with rice, udon noodles, potato pancakes... We tried to order a salad but were told that they were out, which was the only big letdown. The potato pancakes were a bit plain but the other dishes were satisfying and filling. I would definitely go back if looking for a quick, simple eat. There's a good range of food to choose from and although the setting doesn't look very elaborate, the food is certainly good."}
{"text":"The best budget japanese food in Toronto. Great udons, Ramens, also very good customer service!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap eat around this area, this place definitely can fulfill your wish. You can order two dishes to fill up your extremely starving stomach and they all came to under 15 dollars. But I don't think it is a good idea for those who lives far away to visit this restaurant in case you putting a high expectation on their foods/service. (Unless you understand what a Japanese home style cooking, otherwise please believe in the old sayings, you pay for what you get.)

I have been to this place countless times and they alway served nice food with friendly service. 
I love every single dishes on their menu except a few like the Yaki Onigiri (Grilled Rice Ball). It tends to be too salty for me. 

Their Japanese home style cooking is great for those who live alone by themselves, so that you can feel the warmth before heading back home after a full day of work. A nice place to dine neither you are solo nor with your bestie. 

p.s. I usually avoid to come here during hot summer time as they do not own an A/C, (they have several fans on though during summer) it is a nightmare to wipe your own sweat and eating hot food at the same time. So seize our freezing winter time and check this place out if you happened to be around."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for lunch. Everything in their menu is affordable, and they are quick at serving you the food. I'm truly a fan, and I've been coming here for years now. I love the beef donburi and udon, curry udon, spicy minced pork with rice, and taokoyaki! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area, and it's a gem in the Village by the Grange food court."}
{"text":"Manpuku offers shirataki noodles as a substitute in any of their delicious noodle-full soups. That is all. And it's reason enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and like and appreciate it. With that said, based on my latest visit, this is a generous four-star rating.

First and foremost the food. 
I very much appreciate the items on the menu (rice, udon noodles, more recently ramen noodles and other staples of Japanese cuisine), which are not made fusion or Canadianized. No gimmicks here. What is more they offer varieties related to the owner's Kyoto hometown.
The taste however leaves something to be desired. The food needs much more flavour. Japanese food needs marination and dashi and Manpuku needs to step up.
The portions are small, but I have to say that I was completely full for $11 because I ordered two dishes. yes, the prices... knowing they are in a food court and next to a college the prices are economical.
I had the shigure rice bowl and missed the shoga (ginger) taste, It lacked favour, which is why they offer you Japanese seven spices automatically. The rice was fine. The bowl was $7, which is fair. 

They also offer alcohol and Japanese cheesecake, etc.

Think about it. Their ramen bowl is $8 (which is how much a ramen bowl is in Japan) and they are only one small non-corporate location. In contrast some of the other ramen chains in town charge double that (and I have to say while they offer a little more quantity the quality of some ramen in town leaves a lot to be desired so it is not like we are comparing very bad ramen to very good ramen either). Kinton needs to improve its broth, get better chashu. Sensotei's tonkotsu is not even tonkotsu. Touhenboku is rather bad. I don't even bother with places like Ajisen..

Service
This place is packed and they are rushed. With that said, they are all Japanese so they never comes across as impolite or dismissive. Unlike Kinka, Sake bar Kushi, Uncle Tetsu, etc. the black t-shirt clad staff are entirely Japanese here. The good looking owner has done the same thing for over ten years and is still attentive and caring. They could probably use an additional waitress, but fact is where would they stick the person?? lol
Upon entrance you are given a menu and asked whether you would like tea or water. Everything else moves at varying speed i.e. depending on how busy they are could be fast or slow.
The waitress/cashier are still polite.

They are in a food court, but occupy the favoured walled-off and dine-in space with waitstaff. Amazingly, for $11 or so one could have a meal and a side, which is what eating at the crappy junk food (McDonalds, Popeyes...) stands next door would cost you!

During lunch here I had the pleasure of sitting next to what sounded like a student and her teacher and could overhear the entire conversation with what sounded like a pretty straightforward attempt by her to pick him up. I am all for younger women/much older men relationships (and anything else that anyone's heart desires), but kept wondering if there are rules for student/teacher relationships. Whether he ended up saying yes to her or not I cannot be sure, but he did pick up the bill for both of them lol.


I recommend you order udon if you go to Manpuku."}
{"text":"Location:  Grange food court, but it is closed off like a separate, but small restaurant.

Good prices, but strange service.  Immediately after I ordered, I was asked if was going to be separate bills.  I actually didn't understand because 1) waitress had an accent and 2) it was an unexpected question.

Ordered Natto Udon.  All the 3 elements in the noodle soup were served at different temperatures, including the spinach that wasn't hot enough.  Just very simple.  My friend said that his ramen was not up to par with another neighbouring ramen joint.

What I'm trying to say is, contrary to the reviews, don't have high expectations.

At the end, after going up to the cash to pay, the cashier just took my change.  I didn't have a chance to decide on her tip, she just dumped it into the register which I didn't really appreciate.

Expect level of service + food to match low prices."}
{"text":"I appreciate that Manpuku serves different variations of Japanese cuisine. If you are looking for alternatives to the abundance of sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto, or on a budget and looking for a quick meal, I suggest you give this place a try.

-Takowasa - $3.99: If you don't know what Takowasa is, it's a bowl of chopped raw octopus smothered in a \"pickled\" wasabi sauce. The octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat. I doubt the restaurant used fresh wasabi for this dish, as the octopus was extremely spicy and left this \"burning\" aftertaste in my mouth. So really, I wish they would have served this with seaweed, as the salty seaweed would help to cut down the spiciness. 

-Chawan Mushi - $3.99: Chawan mushi is an egg-custard dish, and when made properly the egg should have a silky and barely set, or quivering texture. This Chawan Mushi was quite different, in terms of texture, from a chawan mushi that I had previously. This was really watery and too bland for my taste, I don't recommend it at all.

-Hotate rice (Rice bowl topped with scallop and egg) - $8.99: the hotate rice tasted just like an okonoyami on top of rice. Also, there weren't many pieces of scallop, anyhow it was $9, I don't think you can expect much

-Salami Curry - $6.49: Manpuku's signature curry sauce on a bed of rice, with toppings such as pan-fried salami, ketchup, mayo -  sounds like a weird combination but somehow it works! The curry had a thicker texture than other curries I have had before, and the ketchup sweetened up the curry. The salami provided some saltiness and spicy to the dish, which in turn added a great depth of flavor that's unique to the curry"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this japanese eatery.  This place may be difficult to find if you've never been before. It's actually in the grange food court just east across the street of OCAD.  The food I thought was actually mediocre although I have yet to try more of their menu.  The place was empty when we came just before closing and service was okie but not amazing.  Got the noodle soup which was kinda disappointing compared to Kinton just up the street.  Prices are really good for what you get.  Would return if in the area.

Food 3/5
atmosphere 2.5/5
pricing 4/5
service 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 out of 5 for now because of my overall experience. 

Let's talk about the food that i've ordered. First is the yakisoba. The tripes were really flavorful and were cooked very well. I was just hoping that they could add a bit of meat on it just to give it a different texture. Second is the takosen. The takoyaki itself is very yummy! And i love how perfect the squid tentacles were. I'm not that sure though if the senbei has to be crunchy or not, because when I ate it, it wasn't. So i just ate the takoyaki with one senbei. 

Talk about service. I got the best server ever! I love how welcoming his face was. He was all smiles and he made sure that I have everything I need and he even checks up on me. Very genuine service. I'll try something else next time, maybe by then, I have a new rating. =)"}
{"text":"yelped this place up while I was at st.mike. It was tough to find, after going up and down mccaul for a second time I decided to check out the food court on mccaul and discovered manpuku tucked away in this unexpected location.  The restaurant is small and fast moving.  Everything on the menu was very affordable.  Service was fast.  Would recommend this place if you want to grab a fast and affordable bite."}
{"text":"I've been coming here so long the owner has practically seen me grow up from a sheltered junior high school student who would make special trips downtown just to eat here to a university student who now lives quite close by. Not to sound too arrogant, but ever since my friend and I found out about this place, we've tried our best to spread it like a fabulous, delicious disease. I've introduced many a friend to this restaurant, who've in turn introduced their friends, etc. to the point where I'll often run into people I know when eating here.

Why is it so good? It's good because it doesn't try too hard. Manpuku doesn't sell itself on being a \"trendy\" restaurant capitalising on its Japaneseness. (Asian restaurants that play up their own Asianness as 'exotic' just ring warning bells!) Instead they try to be good at what they do, which is make delicious and cheap casual Japanese food not easily found at other Japanese restaurants in Toronto.

I'm too shy to make conversation with the employees but you do see many other regulars who will sit at the bar counter and chat with them.

Don't be surprised then, to come at a time when the place is very busy. The service is usually very good, with the owner and the more experienced waitresses usually being very reliable. Expect longer wait times and reminding them when it's really busy though. Only once recently did we get an obviously-new waitress (I'd never seen her before either), but it wasn't an inconvenience.

Almost all the food is good, I promise. This isn't fine dining, but it's great comfort food. They do a hearty udon soup that I haven't had anywhere else in Toronto. There are also other dishes that are fairly original or are just not common here, like hotate rice and shirauo rice. They also have natto, if that's your thing. I haven't had better takoyaki in Toronto for their price, either.

I could keep raving about it but I think the reviews and what I've written so far have said enough, so go try it yourself!"}
{"text":"Currently living in Toronto for the first time in a LONG time and having fun checking out the Now Magazine lunches for $5ish guide that just came out last week. \"Manpuku\" was on the top of my list to try and it shall stay there - VERY affordable, fresh and delicious. The atmosphere in this eatery is sweet - bustling with a mixed lunch crowd of students, businesspeeps and everyone in between. And a hop skip from the AGO it would be a fun place to have lunch before indulging in one of their well-curated shows. 

I went for the \"Kake Udon Soup\" ($3.99) and added the steamed spinach ($1.49) which was hearty, hot and healthy. My friend ordered the $7.50 noodle bowl with funky soy beans atop and although she said it was an odd flavour, it was interesting and she'd definitely return to sample some other dishes."}
{"text":"Hidden inside the Grange foodcourt, I would've never known about Manpuku had it not been for a friend showing me this gem! Came here once before but visited recently as I'm having Japan withdrawals and had to get my fix.

The menu is very simple - noodles, rice dishes, apps and drinks - but its reminiscent of some of the smaller joints I visited while in Japan. Had the Niku (beef) Udon on my most recent visit and it definitely brought back some of that taste of Japan that I've been craving. The serving bowl may seem small but trust me when it'll fill you right up. 

Pricing is right there with regards to the area as I'm sure many students frequent the joint. Decent amount of seating area too from what I saw, and the servers are all friendly and helpful! 

Would definitely return whenever I'm in the area looking for a cheap and incredibly filling meal!"}
{"text":"They had great service! Eventhough the takoyaki was a 20 minute wait it's totally worth it! The best medium sized takoyaki ever! The hottae rice taste good aswell!  very cheap for its price down here in Toronto near Eaton and Chinatown"}
{"text":"How lucky to have stumbled on this place!   Cannot wait to go back and explore the menu a little more.  I had the fried tofu appetizer and beef udon soup.   My friend had the curry udon.  I tried and like it more than mine.  Cute place!"}
{"text":"It's a bit busy at times, but it's a great place to grab a quick cheap bite.

I usually go with the negitama gyudon (beef bowl with egg and green onion). My friends usually get the hormone yakisoba (interesting name, huh?), which is basically tripe and noodles stir-fried in a thick, rich sauce. We order the same things consistently so you probably can't go wrong with those choices.

The onigiri had a lot of rice in it, and not enough meat IMO. To be fair though, it's onigiri and doesn't usually come with rice. Their fried onigiri is really good - if you like crunchy slighty-burnt rice (many people do) then that's your thing.

Service is pretty quick/attentive despite how busy the place gets.


I'm not sure why, but I always end up overhearing other people's drama when I come here. There was this one time a girl was complaining about how she didn't want to break up with her boyfriend because she considered everyone else around her age (late twenties, I'm guessing) to be the \"leftovers\" that no one else picked up. Lol."}
{"text":"I can't believe the people who are raving about this place.  OMG.  I went in there once and it was enough for me.  Ordered a beef dish which tasted as though it had been BOILED even though it was supposed to have been done on the teppan.  It had a boiled taste, looked boiled and was severely unappetizing ..."}
{"text":"Never been here before, but saw the great reviews for this place and have been meaning to try the food here for while. Had a look through the menu and everything was moderately priced but also looked ike snack size. 

So, I ordered a negitama gyudon and takoyaki for dinner today. The food arrived super fast. And looked nice at first glance. But upon eating... Boy, what a real disappointment. The food was awful. The rice in my don was mushy and wet/soggy and the gyudon was bland! It not like the rice was wet from the sauce, it was wet from too much water. Like as if a total noob made the rice. To give a better idea, I would say it tasted like I was eating plain congee with overboiled pieces of meat (super rough/dry) that also tasted like nothing. My egg on top had more seasoning than the meat... I could not even finish this meal as everything tasted like bland congee. I would not recommend having any rice dishes here. 

The takoyaki was not the best I've had. But at least there was taste. This place does not have the best takoyaki in toronto. There was too much wet dough in the centre as the takoyaki balls were quite large...as large as golfballs or maybe even larger? So, they were also mishaped and not round. 

Well, I'm glad I have finally tried this place though, now I can finally stop wondering."}
{"text":"Well priced. Cool area. Tastes great. Good quality udon, rice, and beef. 

5/5 because they play Nujabes on repeat. 

Get the takoyaki."}
{"text":"Tiny eatery right across OCAD that serves good authentic Japanese food. 
My friend and I ordered different dishes of snacks and two main dishes. 

I ordered Hotate Rice which is rice bowl topped with scallop and egg. I like the taste, very...yummy. The rice isn't dry (compare to other korean/japanese/chinese restaurants) The display was quite eye-catchy too.

My friend ordered Kake Udon. The broth was a bit bland but my friend adjusted the taste with soy sauce. 

We also order tofu nuggets (which I fell in love with right at the first bite), shrimp balls, fish cake, and green tea cheesecake. 

I love their tofu nuggets. They taste marvellous. Shrimp balls, in my opinion, was too floury. I could hardly feel the shrimp inside. Not bad, but not very good. The fish cake was tasty, but didn't leave me much impression.

The cheesecake was okay. I've tried many amazing cheesecake, it definitely wasn't among one of them. It was smooth and cheesy, but I could taste the \"fridge-taste\" on the cheesecake (like..you put your cake in the fridge with other food for too long, the cake started to lose its own taste...) It would be better if they give me fresh one, and I wish the green tea taste was stronger.

The service is quick. Staffs here are extremely friendly.

The price is pretty reasonable for the food portion and the quality. I will definitely come back here for the tofu nuggets and try some other desserts, another chance for their green tea cheesecake maybe?"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some onigiri this past weekend. We googled, \"best onigiri in toronto\", and Manpuku was the first result!

Needless to say, Manpuku did not disappoint! We each started with the onigiri; one stuffed with tofu and one stuffed with plum.  The rice was moist and succulent. Definitely, hit the spot.

We followed up the onigiri with the niku udon - I replaced mine with the shirataki noodles: De-licious!! 

The grande finale was dessert: black sesame ice cream and ice cold mochi balls filled with green tea, strawberry and chocolate!!

This was the best part of my weekend! I'll be back in no time!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Manpuku and have been meaning to check it out. I went around 9pm on a Friday for a late dinner. They had a huge menu selection which was awesome, but unfortunately they ran out of the seafood and beef dishes for the night. 
Here's what I ordered:
- Japanese potato salad: 1/5 don't order this... definitely not the sweet Japanese potato salad I'm used to. This one was seasoned with mustard seeds and no salt?
- Tea rice: 5/5. Amazing, really flavorful and light, texture was on point as well. Best part? It was only 3.99! Probably the most bang for your buck on this menu.
- Stew beef with potatoes: 3/5. Typical Japanese dish you cook at home, you usually can't go wrong with this one. The dish was a bit too sweet for my liking, but I wasn't expecting much for $3.99. 

All three dishes only cost me 12 bucks. I think it's pretty worth considering the wide menu selection they offer. I would definitely come back and check out their other dishes!"}
{"text":"by far, my favorite place for Japanese food. no they don't have sushi. it was always crowded when I was there. it's placed right in front of OCAD and their prices are awesome! from udon dishes to mochi ice cream, the overall taste is not something over the moon, but it makes me comfortable. takoyaki takes some time so if you are in a hurry, skip takoyaki. I always get Niku udon which is with beef topping. simple and filling. their rice dishes are also my fave when I don't feel like eating noodle. Soboru don ia good. however, the triangular rice ball,Onigiri, wasn't so my thing. but go for the tofu nugget. sooooo good. you would never be able to tell that it's tofu."}
{"text":"Manpuku Japanese eatery is kinda hidden inside Village by the Grange. It is Japanese owned and guarantees authenticity and true Japanese flavours. 

The restaurant itself could use a refresh, and on a hot summer day this place could be unbearable as there is no AC, just a small fan here and there

Pricing is perhaps the restaurants strongest quality, and dishes are typically under $10. My favourite thing to get there is the miso chicken udon - it is surprisingly tasty, and the udon noodles have a nice chew to it (it's not the cheap mushy ones)"}
{"text":"Good cheap traditional Japanese food.  Fast service for a quick lunch. My favorite is the curry beef on rice...super flavorful!"}
{"text":"I've quickly fallen in love with this place...It's cheap, delicious, authentic, and just plain good and satisfying. 

Hidden (or not so hidden) in the Village By the Grange food court across from OCAD, this small Japanese noodle shop has never disappointed. The service is pretty speedy considering the hordes of hungry and sleep-deprived students that patronize them every lunch hour and super friendly to boot. An average bowl of udon will cost you $8 with tip, and if you order some extras in your udon, and sides (like takoyaki or onigri to share with friends) your bill will still be under the $15 mark which I think is EXCELLENT.

I usually have the Niko Udon (beef broth with onions, sliced beef, and udon noodles) which is oh-so yummy...the broth is perfectly seasoned, noodles are fresh and sfot, and the beef is wonderfully flavourful and tender. I also tried the curry udon once which was really good and a different touch if you're a little tired of the regular. I have yet to try the famous takoyaki but I've had the onigiri which comes piping hot to your table and super yummy and fun to share with friends. Everything else described by other Yelpers sound really tasty and can't wait to try some more. 

The service, food, and price can't be beat...This place is the most wonderful low-key and satisfying udon place in the city. I dare you to dislike it here."}
{"text":"Not bad, only ordered a couple of apps. Service was pretty good, and fast! Except when you order the octopus. Cheesecake was frozen and then they thawed it, so not impressed with that."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I can see the appeal of Manpuku especially among OCAD students across the street. The food is very affordable and tasty. It's a good place for a quick casual lunch.

I tried the curry ramen which I didn't like as much as their  classic ramen which had a light broth. The curry ramen was basically diluted curry in water with some udon noodles.

Takowasa (wasabi and octopus) was good but doesn't come with seaweed to wrap.

Takoyaki was decent and good as a shareable app among friends.

Overall, I'd stop here again for a quick bite but probably pass on the noodles and try some other rice-based dishes."}
{"text":"I found this place when one of my friends on Instagram posted their dinner here one day. What caught my eye about Manpuku was that they offered ice cream mochi! 

Mochi for some of you that don't already know: is a Japanese dessert made of rice cake that is filled with either ice cream or other fillings like red bean or green tea. 

I've tried the packaged mochi with the regular fillings from T&T and other Asian grocery stores, but I've never tried out ice cream filled ones. Neither have I tried it at a restaurant. 

I decided to come to Manpuku to finally try this Japanese dessert and found that it was amazing! They offered taro, red bean, green tea and vanilla ice cream flavours. (I might be missing more)  They were fairly priced, but when I asked if it was fresh or made at the store - due to language barriers - I think they told me they received them from a shipper. 

However, I didn't just come to try the ice cream filled mochies, another thing that caught my eye here was the takoyaki! (A ball shaped snack made of wheat and filled with octopus.) This snack was delicious! I've tried takoyaki from other Japanese restaurant but this place nailed it. It was the perfect balance of sauce, chewy and flour that definitely had my mouth watering. 

Manpuku is a place recommend for those wanting to try something new and different in their life. It is also located in the core of DT.

- CL"}
{"text":"I'd heard nothing but amazing things (admittedly all from Tammy Y.) about Manpuku, so I was beyond stoked to finally wrap my frozen paws around a big steaming bowl of udon. Now, the only problem I had was that besides the bowl, nothing else served to me could actually be called sizeable. You know that freak flush of the toilet when only half the water returns and you think to yourself that something weird is going on? That's what I felt like when I was presented my half bowl of noodles.

My friend's beef don was reportedly awesome. It reminded her of this very specific and unbeatably delicious oyako don of her childhood. My other friend's beef udon was apparently also awesome. Both the udon and the toppings in his bowl were more than double that of the ones in mine too. Strange, but I'm not complaining - just telling it like it is.

The two measly slices of sweet tofu skin in my noodles were inari-like and indeed sweet. They could have really used some veggies or other space-filling sidekick. For two extra bucks, I got a tangy and colourful salad and a miniature bag of \"chips\" (crushed instant noodles). I would highly recommend allowing the extra 20 minutes (how long it takes for the custom order to be prepared) for your meal and getting the takoyaki in your combo instead.

A word of caution: It was sweaty like a sauna in the restaurant. Arrive prepared, dressed in layers. Sweat moustaches might be sexy, but they may also alter the taste of your soup."}
{"text":"Great place! The servers are inviting and the food is pretty original.
I have been here about 5-6 times to eat in and i've had a lot of food on the menu; it is reasonable and delicous.
The only problem is that the place is extremly small, so beware before bringing too many people. :)"}
{"text":"Hidden away at a food court near Art Gallery of Ontario, this place is good for trying Japanese food other than typical sushi, sashimi, ramen and udon fare. Service is friendly; portions are decent; and prices are inexpensive.   

I was hoping to try Takosen, because I usually like senbei (rice crackers) but alas, they were out of takoyaki, beef and chicken. Really, no takoyaki, beef or chicken on a Saturday evening? So, I got adventurous and ordered a ground pork rice bowl and infamous Natt? Gohan. The waitress kindly warned me by asking if I knew what natt? was. I just wanted to try it, because I heard that it was good for you. 
 
Natt? definitely required an acquired taste. It reminded me of Korean fermented soybeans stew called Chung Gook Jang. Maybe because I've had Chung Gook Jang a couple of times a long time ago, I found natt? at least edible. I was able to finish about one-third of it, but if I had an unlimited amount of time and an unlimited amount of side dishes to clear my mouth of that taste, I might have even finished the whole dish. My date could not stand the smell nor the taste of natt?. He spat it out after daring me to take a spoonful of natt? with him lol. This is what I expect your reaction to natt? will be as well. The minced pork rice bowl was of course tastier of the two. I didn't really enjoy these dishes but it was fun to try something new."}
{"text":"Very delicious and cheap udon noodles with good texture and Homy broths... Takosen with crackers are delicious but takes 15 min wait."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I actually came twice this week.  Now, this place may not appeal to everyone.  It's Japanese home style comfort food that are simple dishes that taste so good!  You would probably appreciate the food a lot more if you lived in Japan.  I could probably eat this food every day.  I had lunch with my coworkers here on Wednesday and again today (Sat) for lunch with my family.  And did I mention the food is so cheap here.   A small dish of spinach for $1.25, Oden for $2.99, and fishcake soup udon for $4.99.  My favorite dish was the Hotate rice, fried egg with scallops for $8.99 - a little pricier but really yummy.  The only thing that I didn't like was the takoyaki.  Another tasty dish we ordered was the yakisoba, pan-fried ramen with tripe.

The staff are very friendly and food is served super fast.  The food actually taste a bit better on my 2nd visit today.  It might be because they were extremely busy on Wednesday so they rushed in preparing the food.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars because there's no half star option. not a lot of seafood toppings for dishes containing them and onigiri was bland. otherwise, very affordable authentic japanese cuisine! definitely a hidden gem.

my friend and i shared 4 dishes and the total cost was 21$! how affordable is that? we got:

onigiri - both tofu and tuna. very bland. minimal tofu/tuna to none

chawan mushi (japanese egg pudding with seafood) - creamy and very different from tradition \"pudding\". think soup but with a layer of eggs. again, barely any seafood. 

sobaro don (spicy minced pork on rice) - probably the best dish! large portion, lots of meat. could use a bit more spiciness but according to my friend it was perfect. very flavourful! the scallions added a touch of freshness to the disg

takoyori - the best takoyori i had in years. it's made to order so you know it's fresh. again, very little octopus pieces. everything here goes well together

super fast service!"}
{"text":"Cute cute place! Quite hidden in my opinion if it wasn't for a friend's post.

The place inside was very warm, temperature wise. Came here in the summer so maybe their AC wasn't jacked up yet. But, their food made up for it. Came here specifically for their takoyaki (squid balls). It came in a small dish of 6, good for sharing or for yourself. The outside was nice and crisp, while inside was warm and soft. It was however a bit strong on the ginger side. If you're a fan of ginger this might be the place for you.

We also ordered the gyuu don; portion was pretty decent for what you pay for and the dish was served fresh and warm. The menu was also really cute - the little Manpuku man. Note: the employees there are Japanese so try to be patient if they don't understand what you say the first time. They are very polite though so points to service."}
{"text":"Love this place. . .    Anytime I'm sick or have a hangover ... I hit up Manpuku and get some soup.   It always makes me feel better. No touristy tempera or sushi.   . . It's rice dishes and soups squid balls and  fermented soybeans . I try to avoid processed carbs and they make a shirataki noodle for all there soups.  Natto is awesome ...kind of like the blue cheese of the soy world :) and the service is supper friendly.  .. ."}
{"text":"Great lunch joint for a quick Japanese fix. It's in a plaza/mall. Its majority home style Japanese food. The quality of food is mediocre, it does the job in terms of fixing a quick Japanese craving for a decent price. 
It is Japanese owned and run. The currys are the best."}
{"text":"Authentic awesome japanese food for dirt cheap?! It's a college student's dream. Hiding in then food court of the Grange is Manpuku in the corner. 

Seated immediately for lunch with friends. They serve Japanese comfort food. I had the Niku udon as recommended by other Yelpers. Comes with either chicken, beef, or pork - I choose beef. Broth is flavourful and delicious. 

Service was prompt. Don't forget to pay upfront when you are finished. They also sell other small Japanese snacks by the register. 

Really want to give 5 stars but they didnt have the takosen and any ramen when i came that day. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"my friend and i were looking for a quick bite on queen street but it seemed like everything was just overpriced and just not great value for their price. 
We yelped and found this little place by fluke. 

everyone who works there is Japanese so they are pretty knowledgeable on what they have to offer.  the service was great, place was clean, the food were all super tasty. This restaurant doesn't have the burden of sourcing fish so they focused all their energy on cooking yummy comfort food. The udon, tofu, appetizer and some beef rice dishes we tried were all great. with the only complaint being the rice were a little soggy than sticky. 

The best part, the price is right, every dish is under $10 , some are even under $5. This should be the new lunch under $5 restaurant!


i can't wait to come here again to try the takoyaki that everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"When we have a craving for Japanese food that's not all dynamite rolls and tempura, we head to Manpuku.

It's a small-ish Japanese restaurant in the OCAD area that serves a variety of Japanese fast food for a very reasonable price.

We ordered the beef niku udon ($5.95)  and the curry udon ($6.95) and both were bowl fulls of noodle and brothy goodness.  Extremely satisfying, not to mention at a thrify price.

When we asked about dessert, the waitress said \"We have black sesame ice cream\".  OH MY GOD, YES!!!

We ordered 2 portions but I think 1 order would have been enough to share between two people because each order comes with 2 scoops.  This is not your piddly one small scoop of ice cream (unlike Sushi on Bloor).  

Nevertheless, I had managed to polish mine off.  I woud go back just for the ice cream.  It's so unique and tasted exactly like the filling inside those sesame balls at dim sum, but more creamy and cold.  At $3.25/serving, it was a bargain."}
{"text":"Been here a gazillion times in the decade or so since I moved to Toronto and it's never let me down. I live for the kake udon and I swear the ochazuke is the cure for the common cold. Staff is friendly and despite the frenetic atmosphere, the place is always clean. Best dinner under $10 in the city."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, and has the best udon in the city!

Nestled as a standalone restaurant in the middle of a foodcourt across from OCAD, this place is complete no frills but has amazing service, food and prices. I'm a regular frequenter of this place since being introduced, and no other udon I've had before or after can even compare.

Although many people call the foodcourt where it is located as depressing, I'd have to say it's one of the most ecclectic and multicultural foodcourts I've ever seen, with great looking food and amazing aromas as you walk through. Sure, it's dark as it's dated -and look at where it's located - in the core of the OCAD district, catering to students and low rental housing. But Manpuku is where it's at! The service staff are all super friendly - you are greeted by all the moment you walk into the resto and are told to sit wherever you like. The menu isn't huge, but every item we have had to date has been super flavourful and really hits the spot. I have never left Manpuku hungry (and trust me, I can eat!).

One of our favourite dishes is the Niku Udon - tender thinly sliced beef in a bowl of savoury beef broth and udon noodles. Top this with Nanami Togarashi, which they bring on the side, and it is nothing shy of delicious. It is a perfect winter warm-up and I consider it to be a perfect comfort dish whenever feeling tired or under the weather. 

I am a huge fan of broth and always ask for extra, which they always bring without charging extra, whether for dine-in or takeout. The prices are super reasonable, and I honestly love all of the wait staff (one of the regular servers remembers us - we've been there maybe 10 times in total - and as soon as she sees us, knows exactly what we'd like without ordering. Surprising, considering how many people come in on a daily basis). We're always greeted by all when leaving as well, so I am completely impressed with this resto everytime from start to finish."}
{"text":"Tucked away from the street in an unassuming food court you'll find Manpuku.. You might think you discovered a hidden gem if not for all the newspaper clippings on the walls claiming \"the best takoyaki\" in the city. 

It's a small place that gets busy quickly (half their space seems to ALWAYS have a private party going on), and they're really popular with the OCAD crowd (given the closeness that's not shocking).  I've seen them serving people sitting at the food court tables, which i thought was an interesting idea.

Anyhow we decided to test their claims in the takoyaki department.  Our group of 4 ordered 2 orders of takoyaki to share and were told there would be a wait of 20 minutes and asked if we still wanted it.. Hell yes we did.  I also ordered the shigure don (rice with beef/onions/sauce) and devoured it, although the portion was a touch on the small side.  Then the takoyaki came and we were impressed! After nearly burning ourselves stuffing our faces, we came up for air and agreed that it lived up to the hype! We ordered 2 more and waited another 20 minutes happily.  Luckily they serve beer so we managed to entertain ourselves while waiting.

Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I now think I can truly say I enjoy Japanese cuisine. Before if I told you I was a Japanese food lover, I would be lying because my knowledge and experience of the fine foods of Nippon only included sushi. I was a sushi fan but I just wasn't qualified to say I was a fan of the whole spectrum that is Japan's cuisine. Once I realized that, I went out of my way to try all things Japanese that didn't consist of raw fish on rice. So I tried real ramen, teppenyaki, onigiri and even Japanese snacks like natto.  Manpuku was just one of the places that helped me on my eating quest. 

Manpuku is a little food joint right inside a tiny mall. The place is comfy and the people running the place are all very friendly. Good choice for lunch or a casual dinner. 

The food is what makes this place unique from all the other restaurants near by. They serve very casual Japanese comfort food. Hearty rice bowls and steaming hot noodle soups. I tried the shigure don. It was a simple dish of beef and onions on rice. Very solid dish that was filling. Also had some takoyaki with my meal. They're octopus filled dumplings/balls. They were pretty good tasting but I couldn't help but notice some of my takoyaki had no Octopus inside at all! A real letdown to an otherwise yummy treat. 

Best thing about this place is the price. Eat a filling meal for just about 10 bucks. A great bargain in my books."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy homestyle Japanese food. If ever in the area, definitely check it out! I had the takoyaki and the beef udon, and they were really good. The takoyaki is soft and chewy, a great savoury snack to have. The udon had a nice broth and the beef slices were tender and cooked well. 
I liked it here!"}
{"text":"I can get an appetizer, entree, and dessert here without breaking the bank. I wish I lived closer so I could have affordable meals everyday.

Manpuku is a favourite among students since all their dishes are under $10. In fact, you could spend $10 here and leave very full. 

I usually order their curry udon which leaves me quite full despite what the price may suggest. It comes with soup, udon noodles, and their curry on top. I like to drink the soup first and then mix the udon noodles with the remaining curry so it doesn't wash out the curry flavour. It's a comfort meal that costs under $8, so if you like udon and curry, this is a must order!

For appetizers, I normally get their tofu nuggets. They're brushed with a sweet and sour sauce and packed with edamame and carrots for an awesome change up in texture. 

If you're thinking of getting a dessert, I would definitely say go for it. I've had their tofu cheesecake and mango cheesecake - personally, I prefer the mango. There's no crust, unlike the tofu cheesecake, but the mango flavour comes through nicely. This comes in at $3.50 (I think).

In total, our bill came to under $50 when 3 of us each ordered an app, entree, and dessert. Amazing deal and place! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Japanese food are amazing and tasty! Prices are quite reasonable especially for the students. Had Takoyaki and Yakionigiri = thumbs up! Except you will have to wait 20 mins for Takoyaki. Will come back to try others!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and while the food wasn't amazing, it wasn't terrible either. Tea was complementary and servers were attentive with the refills. Only complaint is that the cheesecake was a bit dense and it took a good thirty or so minutes before getting dessert after finishing the main. Although in their defense, the place was quite busy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Manpuku since it first opened - the quality has gone down over the years, but it's still my go-to place for simple, cheap eats. I went most recently on a Saturday around 1pm with two friends and it was easy to get seated. My go-to's

- Curry Udon (beef): Everyone's fav. 
- Takoyaki (6pc to share): This used to be their best dish but the octopus bits were significantly smaller than before and the bonito flakes were more like crumbs. 

As usual, the staff were friendly, attentive, bill splitting champs. Overall, we paid less than $10 each for decent, filling food in a sit down restaurant - it's hard to find restaurants downtown like this these days. The menu prices have never changed and my wallet loves that, but I'd be more than happy to pay a bit more if the ingredient quality could reflect the old days"}
{"text":"The Udon's broth was the only good thing about this meal. The Udon noodles are very dough tasting and hard. But it's cheap, and you get what you pay for. 
I also got the takoyaki. It took 30 minutes (only a few customers were at the restaurant at that time), so I expected it to be at least okay. But in result, the takoyaki had no \"tako\" (squids). So...that's that."}
{"text":"original, excellent, Japanese udon restaurant, with great curry udon and rice! Wish they also do ramen... lots of different tasty appetizers (good takoyaki, though still not like in Osaka, and with very tiny octopus pieces...). A short advice, add systematically for a udon double dose or refill, because basic portion of udon remains relatively small (add 1.10 CAD). friendly waiters. and sooo cheap!!
they should be open later than 8PM on Monday-Tuesday and Wednesday also!!! (and open on Sunday...?)"}
{"text":"I love this little authentic Japanese spot.  It is almost out of place amongst the sad mass produced fast-food food court that surrounds it.  But like a desert oasis, Manpuku gives you hope.  Honestly love the authentic tastes offered here, and the simple no-nonsense selection.  There is nothing wrong with basic good food, and Manpuku delivers.  My favorites here include the takoyaki, curry udon and sesame ice cream.

The takoyaki takes 20 minutes, but it is worth the wait.  Think of it as a post-meal appetizer if it comes after you're done you're noodles.  For the un-initiated, consider takoyaki to be a pan-fried dumplings with squid.  It is difficult to describe, as i can't think of anything comparable.

All their noodle dishes are excellent, with flavourful but not oversalted stock.  The curry udon is my favorite.

For something crazily different, the natto curry don is interesting.  Natto is at best an acquired taste (that I have acquired) so be warned it is not for all.  On the up side it is vegetarian and you'll get your protein with the natto.  On the down side, not everyone is into fermented soy beans."}
{"text":"As a visitor,  i didnt think this place was inside a school and cafeteria like. The food is good like others have said.  The ramen here was very good! We didnt get to try the T something balls bc they ran out. I thought udon was decent. But ramen definitely worth coming for. And its also cheap!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I forget that this place is a udon eatery and not a ramen noodle shop, but every time i end up walking away satisfied anyway.

The last time i came here with some friends, we got here at around 7:30pm and they were close to closing already. All the curry and beef were gone and we were not left with many choices. Luckily, what is not on their regular old menu is still available - pork! Between the three of us, we had:
- takoyaki
- tofu
- yakisoba
- udon soup with pork and onions

Like someone already said, the udon itself is not dissimilar to the ones you can buy frozen, but their ingredients and soup base is what you can't buy in supermarkets. The service is decent, and the price is cheap. A timeless favourite for OCAD students and locals alike."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to this place. Before today, I have never heard of this place until a friend who went to the university across the street brought me there. 

The restaurant was small as it was tucked in a corner inside a food court. I noticed the menu only had donburi, udon, and some appetizers. We were seated quickly. The waitress were Japanese, so immediately I knew my udon would be more authentic compare to other Japanese udon place. We both ordered udon, with mine the Kitsune udon and hers the Kake udon. We also ordered some appetizers- takoyaki and yakionigiri (pan fried onigiri).

The Kitsune udon didn't have much toppings, only a big piece of inari (sweet tofu skin), and two slices of Japanese fish cake. The portion of the udon was small, but the soup was tasty. The udon was cooked perfectly. 

However, the takoyaki... Well... let's just say I have had better ones. The ones at this restaurant were big, but don't get fooled by the look. It was 90% dough, 10% octopus. The yakionigiri... I don't know... It's salty on the outside, like they pan fried it with soy sauce. I personally not a fan of it. 

Overall, the food was not bad, but the price was CHEAP!! It's only around $5 for a bowl of udon. I will definitely recommend it if you are around the area and looking for CHEAP and TASTY Japanese udon."}
{"text":"The salad was half full if old lettuce.  The Octopus Balls were soggy.  They didn't have half of their special items.  Never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good... for now. Wait till this spot blows the f up."}
{"text":"Niku udon: delicious & it came with such a good price! I would eat this again when I come back here

Curry udon: my friend got it and I got to try it, very flavorful. She also said that she enjoyed it just as much"}
{"text":"I had their beef rice, corn soup (i know, but it's good!) and other dishes when i came back a few times!

price is great and people here are kind.  It's literally hidden from plain sight but once you find it there's a sense of accomplishment.  Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday evening and it was not very busy. The host was quick to greet us and invited us to sit anywhere we wanted. We ordered our food and got it in a timely manner. I got the Yakitori Don (grilled chicken, rice and egg) which was really good. The prices on the dishes are very affordable, mine was 10.99 which is the 2nd highest value next to 14.99. Average dishes are 3-6$ mostly for their udon dishes. Really good place to dine at if you're looking for a nice wholesome meal for cheap!"}
{"text":"Came here once, I think if you're looking for a place that's friendly on the wallet with Japanese dishes, then this is the restaurant to check out. I mean, how can you go wrong with $5.99-$6.99 curry udon or curry don. The dishes wasn't exactly memorable but it was still tasty. I can see this to be a popular student place in downtown. :)"}
{"text":"Manpuku is what you call a hidden gem- tucked away inside Village by the Grange on St Patrick Street, the food here does not disappoint. I usually order the Niku or Curry udon and substitute the udon for shirataki for $1.99 more. One of the reasons I frequent Manpuku so much is because they're one of the only Japanese restaurants I know of that serves shirataki noodles (0 calorie/miracle noodles!!) I'm not a huge fan of ramen joints because I find the entire combination of rich soup, pork belly, egg and heavy noodles to be too much for me.The soup base for the udon at Manpuku is really light yet flavourful and generous in toppings (beef/pork/vegetables). I like that they don't try to be \"hip\" or a complete hole-in-the-wall restaurant; it's clean and simple. It's also not overwhelmingly loud or bustling, service is decent but nothing to complain about! Definitely good value for your money and an atmosphere where you can thoroughly enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"Recommend against the Shigure Don- rice is grossly soggy which makes for an unpleasant texture. Generous amount of meat though which is nice.

Kitsune Udon, would recommend for the price. Broth is nothing special and there's literally only 1 piece of the tofu pouch. I suggest adding an additional one for 75 cents.

Curry Natto Don is quite good. For one, the curry is decent and it doesn't overpower/mask the taste and smell of the natto. 

Natto Gohan is good, but beware that it's excessively stringy (as expected of natto)... there will be thin strings floating from your lips!

Price is reasonable, food is decent- would recommend for casual eats! Can't wait to return and other menu options."}
{"text":"Manpuku Japanese Eatery is great for some cheap eats!

I cannot fault my $3.99 udon.. Yes I have much better udon before. The udon at Manpuku is a little overcooked.. the soup is a little salty... and the fish cake that comes with it are supermarket quality. 

The extra $2 to upgrade to a combo is a really great option!

The salad I have to say that the dressing tasted like something  from Kraft Zesty Italian... If Manpuku would use some Japanese dressing that would be great!

Takosen is quite good even with the less than 20 minute wait.. :P I was there when the restaurant was quite empty.. good side selection if you are eating alone and want to try more items without ordering the whole order! 

The waitress is really attentive and friendly. I like Manpuku Japanese Eatery because it is just so unpretentious.. and great for student's budget!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and they have yet to disappoint. Truly one of Toronto's gems.

It's not your stereotypical Japanese restaurant but upon entering the small space, you are greeted right away. The takoyaki has always been consistent and they make it fresh so be prepared to wait a while. The portions aren't huge but with the low price it makes sense to try out several different dishes. I don't think they've changed prices, like ever. 

My favourite dish here has got to be the Unagi-don (Eel on a bed of rice). The rice is always soft but not mushy and the eel is always bursting with flavour. If you're craving umami, definitely get the unagi. I've also tried (nearly all) of the udon here and you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"It's cheery; it's cheap; it has genuine no-frills Japanese homestyle/comfort/fast food. Not a lot of places like it in Toronto. But it's nothing to write home about, although it's clearly something to Yelp about.

If I were an aspiring starving artist (OCAD is right there), Manpuku would be a go-to. But I'm not, so it's a rare urge."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and the value was incredible. 
I had the beef udon & it was great value at just over $6. I also tried the curry don which had spectacular flavour.  I'd recommend either depending on preference 
Located just off of a food court Manpuku offers both takeout and dine in away from the actual food court. 
I'll definitely be back for the quality & price!"}
{"text":"An absolute jewel located in the dark, depressing, but surprisingly eclectic Village by the Grange. 

I had the niku udon combo with salad and takosen. The salad was small but fresh and nothing particularly special, and I didn't like the takosen at all. I really wanted to, but the takoyaki was mushy and had very little tako in it - in short, absolutely no redeeming qualities.

The udon, however, was a completely different story. While I was a little disappointed that the noodles were the frozen kind, they were chewy and cooked to perfection. The portion of beef was huge. You know how ramen usually comes with a couple slices of meat? Well this came with spoonfuls upon spoonfuls of savoury, delicious beef. Soo good. The real crown jewel, however, was the broth. It was extremely savoury, not over-seasoned and -salted, allowing the natural richness of the broth to come through. It was so good that I drank the whole. Damn. Bowl.

In short, I am definitely going back again, although I think I'll skip the combo option next time. I mean, where else can you eat your fill of authentic Japanese goodness for under $10??!!"}
{"text":"Workers were very Traditional Japanese because they spoke Japanese and were very polite. The food tasted great! Also it was a great value."}
{"text":"Manupku is a small eatery serving quintessential Japanese food. My colleague and I ordered a four dishes to share including, yakionigri ($3.49), niku udon ($5.99), takosen ($2.99), and green tea cheesecake ($3.99). 

Our meal was average at best. My colleague felt the yakionigri was bland.The highlight of our meal was the smooth velvety green tea cheesecake. 

Wallet friendly prices, courteous staff, quint atmosphere - fully belly."}
{"text":"I don't know if I came on an OFF day or I just have different expectations of Japanese snack food, but... can I say - WOW. What a non 5-star experience I had!

Good things first - I came on a Saturday for lunch, and it wasn't crazy packed which is great. They have more space than you'd expect, the interior was cute and quaint and the service was friendly and helpful.

But... that's like talking about buying a shirt, and loving the colour, the workmanship and having the shirt not fit. 

So - The Food. Gosh. 

There were three of us and we ordered two curry pork udons, one of the regular beef udons (it's the one that's listed right above the curry pork udons on the regular menu). 

... To be continued!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, authentic bite of Japan. It's taken me some time to accept that Japanese food doesn't just mean sushi, but I'm a better person for it. I understand why Manpuku receives such great reviews and it frequently very busy, especially in such a student-centric zone.

Arrived with a group of five on a saturday night and they were able to accommodate us by putting a couple tables together. We each ordered our own main, plus a couple extra little dishes for sharing. As I was craving a big bowl of udon, their curry beef udon was a big hit with me - squishy and soupy, with a broth that wasn't over powering at all. It would have been nice to have a little more beef however. The noodles were perfect. I had also ordered the takoyaki and was told that it takes 20 minutes to prepare, but we had some extra time so went ahead with the order anyways. Either the order was misplaced, or sometime had gone wrong, after twenty minutes the waitress came back and apologized and said it would be at least another ten minutes - but we were going to see a movie and couldn't wait the extra time. I'll have to check them out next time I'm there. I love me some takoyaki. 

The rest of my party was happy with their meals, although I did hear some quiet grumblings about 'needing more flavour', or that 'the yaki onigiri wasn't what we were expecting'. A friend straight out said the Chanwanmushi wasn't great. But when it came down to it, we all had a hearty meal, left with full stomachs, and my entire bill was $7."}
{"text":"This was a pretty disappointing visit. We arrived around 7PM on a Saturday night and they were out of takoyaki, beef, and chicken - basically all of the best things in life. I ordered the tsukimi udon from their assorted menu and it was decent. I probably wouldn't order it again though. The fish cake was firmer than I'm used to. And because half of the appealing dishes on the menu were unavailable, I decided to try the sumiso nanoha, which is rapeseed with miso dressing. It was kind of gross unfortunately. Wel also ordered the natto gohan, which was expectedly inedible. The waitress was kind enough to warn us beforehand though. We ordered the soboro don as well, which is spicey minced pork on rice and it was by far the best dish of the night. I highly recommend it. I'd have rated this place higher if they had takoyaki, beef and chicken."}
{"text":"A very nice change from all the Japanese sushi restaurants popping up. Now I can have warm Japanese food.

Fair and low prices. You can eat very cheap as well. Very polite staff. The staff is Japanese so u can rest assured your food isn't too inauthentic.

If you want variety and don't eat too much, you can have a very cheap meal. From 3.99 for an udon to 12.99 unagi and skewer rice bowl. Side dishes start at 3.99 too. Menu is easy to read. 

The place was lined up past the door at dinner time. Mostly with OCAD students. So you know it's popular."}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese restaurant tucked into the Village by the Grange food court. Their thoroughly modern decor will make you forget where you are. They have rock solid noodles and fair prices. Order the Takosen (Takoyaki served on a Senbei cracker). They're like grilled octopus smores, served between shrimp crackers. Becuase they are made to order they take about 20 minutes. The portions here are generous and the service is just fine. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: MAN that's some good PUKU.

Menu Readability: White on black laminated broadsheet with easy-to-read descriptions and pictures of the fare. Veggie dishes are colour-coded.

Need to mention: The place is bigger than you think. There is lots of seating at the back.

What this place teaches me about myself: I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a foodcourt beside OCAD. The taste of the food isn't amaaazing but for the price, it is definitely worth it. It's still pretty good though! The cheapest udon is 3.99, and is actually a decent portion (at least for me). Lots of options and appies to choose from. Already been thrice and would def be back when im craving some soup noods for cheap."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. This place has a nice cozy atmosphere. We got the tradtional Manpuku Ramen, wasabi octopus and some tofu dish. All were really good. Loved the price, friendly staff. would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is honestly pretty awesome.  Super busy during the usual lunch rushes and prob during classes diners it's right beside ocad. 

I have tried:
Takoyaki - octopus balls.  Amazing. Takes a long time to make something like 20 minutes.  It it's so worth. 

Unagi don: huge piece of eel on race and it's amazing.   Might be an acquired taste but I love it.

Miss chicken udon: one for the better udons in the city.  Broth is super flavorful udon is perfect texture. 

Service is amazing the waitresses are so kind probably Japanese.  I would 100% recommend this place.  Price is about 7-12$ for a main"}
{"text":"Manpuku is located within the food court but has its own store / sitting area. It's pretty much a staple for OCAD students as it is inside Village by the Grange. However, it's a hidden gem for many others. 

I walked into this cute little store with wooden decor designed to produce a Japan-like atmosphere. It's menu has a good selection of rices, udon and snacks. One thing that I was most surprised with is the price - the udon is $4-6 and the snacks are reasonably priced too. I've been here before and I usually get the curry udon and takoyaki - and this time I did the same. The food came out promptly as expected for a student eatery. 

The curry udon had a Japanese curry taste - which means it's a very mild and light curry just enough to flavour the broth. There were also a decent amount of beef considering its $5.99. This time the takoyaki was a little lacklustre. Usually I proclaim that this place has the best takoyaki in Toronto - but today, I felt it was a lot of dough and not as light with a good amount of octopus as usually. Maybe it's a one off. In any case, it was $2.50 for 3 pieces so no harm done really. I was surprised that it wasn't consistent this time around. Usually they warn me about the wait for takoyaki but this time they didn't - make me wonder whether it's leftovers from another batch. 

In any case, generally this takoyaki aside, I feel like Manpuku is deserving of 4/5 for its food and price! Good for a quick bite and for a nice warm meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this place because I love cheap, quality asian eats (especially after blowing up my wallet at night it up). But I'm not a fan.

I ordered the Hotate Rice, otherwise known as the scallop and egg rice. It's basically a very thin omelette with a few pieces of scallops smothered in japanese BBQ sauce and furikake. The egg was a bit overcooked and VERY thin. There was way too much rice compared to the layer of egg that topped it. Not to mention, the dish was $10 tax included.

I think the saddest part wasn't the fact that my dish tasted mediocre, but the fact that my friend ordered an udon that was $4 after tax. Not only was it cheaper, but it was bigger and it tasted better.

Sad it didn't live up the hype I imagined I would have for it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!! This is probably my new favourite Japanese restaurant. We didn't have to line up for long and service was fast with the food. And they also give you the bill right away so it reduces the waiting time. 

Now onto the good stuff, we got a small salad (which was surprisingly tasty), kitsune udon (incredibly light and delicious), curry udon (surprisingly authentic and tasty), takoyaki, and hotate rice (again, blew me away). 

The portion were very generous considering the price and because we ordered a lot for two people the server suggested to get a smaller size of the udon so they ended up being $3.50 for still a generous size!!! 

All in all, very impressed and will definitely be bringing friends here!"}
{"text":"At first I could see how it could be alittle hard to find, being someone that wasn't from the area. I had to really do research on how to get to this place, but then I realized (relatively fast) that it was in a small food court. 

First of all, this place is by far the cutest little joint ever. The staff was super attentive and kind. The food was made to order and very very affordable! Not only affordable but also very delicious. 

Also, the Takoyaki was amazing! 
Would definitely recommend this little place."}
{"text":"Deliciously cheap noodle soup. We love getting the beef curry udon here. Staff are super friendly and nice.
Quick take out too"}
{"text":"Best cheap good eats in the OCAD area! Such a hidden gem. You can easily get full for under $10! It only sucks how they don't have AC so it can feel sticky and gross in their in the summer, but you always do have the option to eat out in the food court and they will bring your food out. It's a great little gem and I'm looking forward to coming back to try more things!"}
{"text":"My favorite cheap Japanese food in Toronto !!! 
What can I say more. Just that you really need to try it."}
{"text":"I came here in a group of six during lunch time. As expected, we had to wait for enough tables to free up to accommodate all of us. Luckily, the wait wasn't too long and we were seated. I ordered the \"shigure don\" while my friends ordered various other items. For the most part, all the main dishes came out relatively quickly; the only items that needed a long wait were the snack items (takoyaki). The food was good for the price, and all the employees were polite. My only issue is that the bill was delivered to us, so we expected that the server would return to collect our payment after. That was not the case; it turned out we were supposed to go up to the cash register to pay. Otherwise, everything was great. 

I would return again."}
{"text":"This place has the most authentic Japanese food that is not sushi. They have hot dishes ranging from rice and ramen. The best part is takoyaki though it takes 20 minutes to order. Also you have to order before 30 mins it closes! Takoyaki is only $4.99 for 6 balls are round and fluffy. They are not like the takoyaki you have at Guu or Kenzo because they are freshly made on the grill and not fried. I highly recommend the curry udon with beef or pork! Best place hands down for takoyaki!"}
{"text":"nice lil shop.. hidden in village by the grange... 
authentic Japanese owners and waitress... prices are great.
i would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Delicious! And cheap!

Would highly recommend takoyaki and black sesame ice cream (i warn you its sweet but good!). Udon is also good.

Update: Downgraded to 4 stars as it is fast food japanese and does not do amazing places like Ematei or Solo Sushi Bekkan justice."}
{"text":"This place was so hard to find. Not a Toronto native, but we heard good things so we went on a hunt.
It's located inside one of the OCAD buildings which was a mission and a half.
The food is definitely flavourful and worth it's price. My only distention would be with the texture of the noodles I ate, they were harder than I prefer but that might just be the dish I ordered (the special).
Service was decent; there were only two servers and even though we were sitting close to the counter and it was relatively empty, they weren't the most attentive - they seemed to have their hands full with a lot to do so that was probably why.
The atmosphere was nothing special, felt like your typical asian foodcourt restuarant (which is not a bad thing) but there wasn't a ton of effort into it. The menus were kind of falling apart, which made it slightly more difficult to read (and order).
Over all my experience was fine, if I ever find myself in the area craving noodles on a tighter budget I'd come again... although I want to try something else and give it a different review because everyone says such good things."}
{"text":"Manpuku is a good introduction to Japanese food for those who are new to it. 

It's good because the portion sizes are small, and the prices are very affordable. 

Also, it's one of the few places where you can get homemade takoyaki, fresh from the grill. (That being said, I'm not a fan of the wet, creamy type of takoyaki. I like mine fully cooked). 

So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because none of the items are exceptionally good. There are too many choices, and as a result, you can find higher quality versions of ramen, udon, tempura elsewhere in downtown Toronto. 

But if you want a place where you can find affordable trial sizes of Japanese food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Manpuku is the greatest Japanese eatery i have ever experienced....every single dish is full of flavour and I have never experienced a bland or ill flavour in any of their dishes. Made with authenticity and held in a relaxing and calm environment I will travel all the way from across the city just a dish of their Kake Udon or the Ochizuke. Not only is the food amazing but the prices are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! full size portion dishes average at $4.99! For everyone who loves Japanese food Manpuku is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little find in the Village by the Grange. Awesome food and the price will knock you down. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the extremely fast service during lunch time at Manpuku. Their menu mostly consists of very affordable (under $7) udon dishes and  ideal for students. I ordered a shigure don, and the beef was flavorful but a little dry. I have yet to try the udon and other side dishes but will certainly come back again.  

Manpuku is a budget friendly and tasty, dine and dash Japanese food shop that deserves 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and cheery - and the staff is friendly to a fault. Service is brisk, sometimes frenetically so; the waitresses literally RUN from place to place.

My experience here actually was a somewhat poor one; as I ordered the raw wasabi octopus, and was promptly rewarded with an excruciating stomachache. It was my fault for ordering so adventurously though, and I suspect that my gastrointestinal distress was due mostly to my Americanised digestion system rather than a true case of food poisoning. Still, I eat pretty much anything without my body complaining - so unless you are blessed with an extraordinarily robust stomach, I'd stay away from that option.

Otherwise, the bowl of udon that I had was delicious, and the prices are cheap enough that you can try a bunch of menu options without putting too much of a dent in your wallet.

Be warned that takoyaki is made to order, so it's a twenty minute wait. The rushed schedule of office lunch hour precluded me from trying it this time, but will do so upon my next visit for sure."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Manpuku!!!! a great find for a quick, delicious, cheap meal especially on a cold winter day. I have tried most things on the menu at this point and I really haven't been disappointed with anything they serve plus the price really can't be beat."}
{"text":"CHEAP AND DELICIOUS.

What more can you ask for?

I love my meat so I always order the Niku Udon ($5.99) and make it a combo (soup + takosen) for $2 extra. The udon is perfect: not too al dente, not too soft, and it's got the right amount of chewy-ness to it. The broth/soup is very tasty without being too oily (I'm pointing at you, pho restaurants!) The takosen is so much fun to eat (it's basically a takoyaki sandwich). With the combo, you get 2 pieces of takosen and really, that's all you need! Yes, you'll have to wait for 20 mins for takosen or takoyaki and the waitress will always tell you that. It doesn't matter to me because I like to finish my udon first anyway :) The service is friendly, fast, and attentive. I also like to end my big meal with an order of their ice mochi. One order consists of 3 ice mochis and you can mix the flavors (green tea, mango, and two others I can't remember because I always get the green tea and mango, hahahaha...) For $3.99, it's the perfect ending to my perfect meal at Manpuku.

I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS PLACE! :D"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????105???????????????????????????????B?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"just delicious. If i went to Ryerson, i would go there everyday.
the raw squid with wasabi was hands down one of the best things i've had. Also, the takoyaki was pretty delicious too."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. The prices are amazing and the food is just as good. I always getthe niku udon and it is delicious. Its in a sketchy random mall but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Most people don't know about this place but its definitely a diamond in the rough.  Their food is great for the price and the portions are acceptable by my standards.  Definitely try the Japanese curry."}
