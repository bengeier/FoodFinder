{"text":"A wine bar in an airport.  Disappointing in most important aspects. Seating is satisfactory. Wine list is wide ranging and interesting. Prices are on the high side, with the lowest priced wine about CAD$13/glass. Wine service is appallingly bad.  Deplorable. Wines served in poor condition. Service was slow. In a wine bar you'd expect some attention to be paid to the condition of the wines.  We ordered a glass of Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) made with X-arelo grape variety.  It was served flat, quite simply because the bottle had been opened the previous day.  The glass of Volpaia Sangiovese we ordered was oxidized (also from a bottle opened the previous day).  When we sent the Cava back, it was replaced with a glass from a freshly opened bottle.  However, I was left to struggle through the oxidized sangiovese.   We had to remind the staff to bring glasses of water, requested at the outset. We observed the wait-staff decanting from one bottle into another..... not sure what was going on there.  Service was slow, considering that there were at least four wait staff and we were the only clients. The pulled pork sandwich was quite good. Perhaps management of vino volo thinks that wine quality and service are not important in an airport location, as people are just passing through.  Wrong!  I pass through that part of the airport at least 8 times annually.  I'm a repeat customer, and I would hesitate to stop at Vino Volo again."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before I caught my flight. The Montreal Smoked meat sandwich sign drew me in (while in Montreal....).  I know it's a wine specialty spot but I was really feeling a beer at that time so I got the local Montreal brew Bierbrier Ale and of course the smoked meat.  Service was quick and the sandwich, while not what you'd expect from Schwartz or Lesters downtown was actually pretty decent and the beer went down smooth."}
{"text":"It's an airport lounge/resto, so the prices don't reflect the value like they would elsewhere in the city, but it's very decent compared to the other airport options.  We had a cheese plate that was a little sparse and unoriginal (Oka, Brie, and Gorgonzola), but still enjoyable. The glazed Marcona almonds were very yummy.  We also shared a taco, which we mentioned we were going to share and the kitchen cut in half for us without being asked. Very nice of them. It was a bit bland - could have used some fresh herbs and a bright salsa to go along with the meat and creamy slaw.  Service was very quick, a MAJOR bonus for travellers!  Overall, it was the best experience we've had at Trudeau airport. So I can recommend it with confidence knowing that everywhere else I've tried sucks."}
