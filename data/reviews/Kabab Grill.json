{"text":"I've tried several middle eastern restaurants / fast food joints in Toronto but this one was far and away the best one we've tried. I'm a big guy (over 6' and 225 lb) and I almost never leave food on my plate but I wasn't able to finish the Kabab Grill plate because of their very generous portion. Particularly tasty was the shish taouk (spelling?) ... very tender and very well seasoned. The pickled vegetables were fantastic and were a great contrast to the grilled meats. We went because of a voucher we won at a charity gala but we'll be back and now I see that they even have a location in Port Credit which is a 5 minute drive. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is TERRIBLE. I used to love visiting here, but recently a new owner has taken over and he has absolutely no idea how to run a business. I was a regular here and he changed everything - it's not the great place it once used to be. The falafel  and pizzas are much smaller than they used to be, the tabouli and hummus is runny, no more fresh juices, he has raised the prices, and there's no more Orderit so they don't deliver....... I'm sad to say I don't think I'll be coming back here anymore. Too bad, used to be an awesome joint but since this new owner took over everything has changed."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this place for a while, and now that I have, I'll be returning very soon.  We went around dinnertime and it was pretty quiet inside. I imagine its a great place for lunch, since its relatively inexpensive and there are a lot of good, filling options.  We tried the Shish Tawook plate, which was good and was enough for two people (though some of the potatoes were very dry, as though they'd been out since the lunch rush).  The best options are the pizzas, though.  For $3-4 (depending on toppings), you get a freshly-baked pizza that can provide a filling meal for one.  The cheese and za'atar pizza was the best option that we tried.   There are around a dozen options for toppings too. The spicy chicken was a bit bland for my taste, but the ingredients are fresh and good quality.    Over all, this place is an excellent value, especially the pizzas."}
{"text":"Dropped in via a friends recommendation and the place looks fantastic compared to any shawarma place I've been to. I think they just kept the old decor of the place. A platter of food is $10 and comes with a choice of meat, a choice of salad, potatoes, rice and something else but they will let you choose half and half for your sides. You also get some pickles and pickled turnips with a piece of bread.  The platter is large! I wish more places made their own pickles and pickled turnips and this place tastes no different.  The potatoes were interesting  as expected crispy roasted garlic potatoes but got roasted/baked potatoes that were tossed in hot sauce.  They were nice though but I definitely prefer really roasted potatoes in my meal. The chicken itself was solid and the rice and peas were my favourite part.  This is definitely my favourite place downtown for shawarma and at a very solid price for a platter!  I will be back to try the kababs though."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible customer service.  I have been to many other middle eastern restaurants and decided to try this one out after reading good reviews on yelp.   I dropped by on a Monday afternoon. The female cashier wasn't very friendly. When I was ordering, her face was like telling me, \"Just order your food and leave.\" I asked for two chicken shawarma combo and she asked me what options for the sides. This was the first time I came her so I asked her what sides were available. She answered impatiently and told me to ask the male server instead.   At this point I was already unhappy with the customer service. The male server made me the shawarma wraps and then that's it. I needed to ask for the rice that should have come with the combo. It was $9.99 for each combo and the amount of food was a disappointment. One of the skimpiest shawarma places I have yet been to. Also when I said shawarma combo I was expecting the plater version (ie. not in a wrap) as the price was high.  The food on the other hand is good and authentic. I wouldn't say it's amazing though since I definitely have tried better ones. Won't recommend this to anyone who wants polite service and reasonable amount of food for the price paid."}
{"text":"Was surprised by the quality and flavor of the beef shawarma. Very nice restaurant!"}
{"text":"I liked the staff, they were friendly and nice.  I've been here twice, and both times it took a really long time to get your food.  So this isn't a \"fast food\" joint - have a seat while you wait, even for take-out.  Food is good though. I really liked my platter, the portion was well worth the price.  They have a great pop selection, so getting a combo is a good deal as well."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting shawarma, with a very tasty garlic sauce spread on the inside of the pita. Dinning there was lovely, as they have a cute eating area upstairs, with unique shapped windows looking onto the street. Would definitley visit again."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**  I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch because \"Somethin' 2 talk about\" (The yellow house) next door was closed. The place is a good size and has a separate seating area upstairs. They sell cultural goodies (Halva, figs and jams), pizza, as well as desserts on top of the usual Middle Eastern fare. A sign indicates that their food is Halal.   Since I was in the mood for a wrap I ordered the chicken shawarma which costs $5.97 plus tax. You have the option of adding lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, turnips and hummus.   While we were waiting for our order we saw the waitress deliver several platters of food to the upstairs seating area upstairs. The plates were full of food, and were almost overflowing. The portions were huge and made me wish that we had ordered the combo platters instead.  When we received our wraps I was a little disappointed in the size. It didn't compare to the size of the wraps at \"Somethin' to talk about\" and i was convinced i would need a snack to get me through the afternoon but as I started to munch away Kabab Gril redeemed themselves. The wrap is packed full of flavourful chicken with some yummy crispy bits for texture. The pickles added a nice crunch and contrast of flavour.   My only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce and I couldn't detect any heat (I'm pretty sure I said 'yes' to hot sauce). Will definitely be back to try out the platters."}
{"text":"Kabab Grill is a solid 5 star selection.   The portions are massive. MASSIVE. If you are hungry, and your stomach is bigger than your eyes, head over here.   I tried the Chicken Shawarma plate that was piled high with food. I can't believe I ate it all, but I did. Pitas are fresh and cooked to order. Rice was delcious, and sow as the hummus. Beautiful Lebanese girl working the front counter, only makes things better.  Lemonade was delicious with my meal.    Would definitely return."}
{"text":"4.5 / 5  I'm not sure why, but in my experience most shawarma/pita/middle eastern fast food restaurants tend to be somewhat sketchy with questionable food quality, even if the food itself tastes pretty good.  This is certainly not the case with kabab grill, as everything is much higher end than your typical fast food shawarma place.  To begin, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty nice.  The interior was larger than I thought it would be judging from the outside, and it has two floors with some nice arching windows to look out onto bay street while you eat your meal.  The decor was nice, I went during Christmas season and the place was decorated with christmas trees, lights, and other things.  The whole place is clean and tidy, which i don't usually see from many fast food middle eastern restaurants. To top it off, the service is also quite good, with many friendly employees working hard to make sure service is quick and satisfying.   The actual food itself was very good.  Everything seemed to be really fresh and made with care.  Nothing tasted really out of this world but it was all very good and definitely better than most other places.  I got the chicken shawarma plate/dinner and it came with a good portion of food and a nice little variety of different items in your meal. The prices cost around the same as what other shawarma restaurants would charge, which is odd considering the food quality and overall ambiance is much better than usual, so this was a pleasant surprise.  I wasn't expecting too much from this place other than a quick in and out meal, but it ended up surprising me in a very satisfying way."}
{"text":"I've only has the beef shawarma here once, but it certainly left an impression!  It was simply delicious. One of the best I've had in Toronto. am tempted to go back to try other items.  Venue was very clean and quite spacious.  The food was really fresh and the service was very good.  Definitely give it a try!  A little pricey for a shawarma (even for the area), hence the reason for the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Finally some good middle eastern food!  Ive had the kafta and the chicken shawarma with rice and salads.  Portions are super generous and the food is fresh.  I have been back many times, and will continue to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Tasty and definitely hit the spot. Only down fall was the girl taking the order was easily frustrated at us taking a while to order. And the place was empty!!!"}
{"text":"A work luncheon was catered from Kabab Grill and I was thoroughly impressed !  Tabooli - fresh and no bad after taste. Hummus - very flavorful with garlic, but the said garlic wasn't too overpowering Garlic Potatoes - nicely baked with garlic paste  Falaffel - perfectly fried, great when mixed with tabooli Chicken skewer - delicious seasoning and grilled to perfection  Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Honestly, One of the best Mediterranean  Fast Food joints in the Toronto area! You wouldn't really know its a fast food joint when you look at the place. Looks more like a Bistro. I had the beef and chicken Shawarma, beef was really good but the chicken was great!"}
{"text":"not much to say...  my experience is much like everybody else's - fresh food, great flavor, excellent service.  it's nice and clean too.  i didn't see many desserts though.    my new favorite for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Really nice people, awesome food, reasonable prices. I am middle eastern so I know good food when I eat it. Had the chicken platter, came with hummus, rice, fetoosh salad, bread, and awesome sauces. Only $11. Fresh, delicious. Best meal I had in Toronto. Went to the hotel to tell my friends, they went just before closing and they stayed open to feed us! What nice people. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was walking around and randomly found this place. It was a little before dinner and it was very quiet for a Tuesday. The food is very cheap and they heap it on. And when I mean heap, I had to go back downstairs to ask for another plate so I could spread out the food that they gave.   The restaurant is a very clean 2 story building that has a few nice amenities like a TV and some high windows with art deco in front.   The food itself is quite good. I highly recommend the meat kabab, it is very very tasty with hummus."}
{"text":"Didn't have any food, but the tea and shisha were great.  I'm not a big tea drinker, but I enjoyed the mint tea.  The shisha was surprisingly good, and they had a lot of flavours (we got the mixed berry)! The hookah looked brand new (i wouldn't be shocked if i found out we were the first ones to use it), and tasted super smooth. It came with 2 coals and was cheap too."}
{"text":"Killer kabab joint at the corner of Bay and Gerrard. Recently opened in June 2010, this place outshines other hawkers of Halal. For starters, it looks like a million bucks with tumbled marble tiling, hardwood floors and lots of natural light. It's not often one can comment positively on the aesthetics of a shwarma place, but with two floors and plenty of seating, it's actually a respectable spot to relax and have lunch.    I ordered the chicken pita for $5. It was steaming hot and loaded with fresh ingredients, but nothing spectacular.  But I will give it points for being structurally sound; my hands were not sopping wet afterward, a fate I have befallen after many a failed pita.  I only found out after I went that their mini-pizzas are the way to go. I'll have to try these next time I'm there.  Obligatory Title Pun: KaBAB's your uncle.  Menu Readability: Wisely, they avoided the Obligatory Bad Pictures of Shwarma and went for the standard overhead fast food menu.  Need to mention: They have a small patio upstairs and a shisha for use. For real?  What this place teaches me about myself: Nothing makes me madder than when a pita falls apart on me.  NOTHING!"}
{"text":"Great soup of the day and a very fresh salad. It was a simple lunch and everything was great with super friendly service. They need to get their front door fixed -- but hey, at least that is not effecting the food inside -- just confusing the people outside that are trying to get in.  Bottom line, not much table space if you are going to eat in but still a great place to visit!"}
