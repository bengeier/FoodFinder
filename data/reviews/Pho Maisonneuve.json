{"text":"My family and I travelled to Montreal for a week, after reading a couple reviews we decided to grab some dinner at this location. We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland. HORRIBLE food and TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff. 
Generic, basement atmosphere with fluorescent lighting. 
Mediocre Pho Ga and spring rolls. 

Walked all over town to find the best OPEN Pho shop. Yelp reviews let me down."}
{"text":"Great food, homey warm vibes, the portions are big! So if you don't very much (like me) take the small sized soup! Great for eating alone or with friends."}
{"text":"I loved the pho here! Out of all the restaurants I visited in Montreal this past weekend, this one had the best food. I did not know it was cash only (I used my credit card all weekend) and all I had was a $100 bill american and the guy was nice enough to take it and give me a fair exchange rate. The pho was tasty (I got #26) and the service was great."}
{"text":"Tasty, simple food.  Quick service, good price, nice little place.

And Yelp is ridiculous in that it won't let me post a short review. If I don't want to write a long winded review I should not be forced to!"}
{"text":"Afyer reading the reviews, I was expecting food to be great but sadly no. It was Bland at best."}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Vietnamese food. The tastiest Phô ever! 
A friendly staff/family that has everything homemade. Absolutely LOVE their springrolls with the peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place but this is a tasty place ! 

The service was quick and friendly. The menu has the traditional Vietnamese favourites including Bun Bo Hue... Yes I must be back for the Bun Bo Hue! 

This time around I had the beef pho and it was absolutely delicious. The broth was fragrant and right up there with the bettor pho's in town. This could quickly become one of my faves for lunch since it is walking distance from my work."}
{"text":"This is the worst pho restaurant I've been to.   The broth was disgusting and the noodles were old. Will definitely not recommend.  Not sure how this place has a 4 1/2 star rating... I"}
{"text":"J'aime tout de ce petit boui-boui vietnamien, de la première a la dernière seconde.

1. Le service est discret et en français. rapide et courtois. 
2. La bouffe est excellente, fraîche et la soupe bien chaude, parfait pour les temps froids.
3. Les prix sont incroyables, surtout sur l'heure du lunch. Combo A-1 : Grande Tonki boeuf  (saignant ou cuit) ou poulet avec 2 rouleaux pour 8,25$ ( oui oui, tu as bien lu )
4. Le décor est a la vietnamienne avec le petit temple a buddha et les nappes blanches, mais c'est tellement mimi !
5. Ils prennent interac.

Ca y est je suis vendue. Je le recommande a tous !"}
{"text":"I was the only guest at 8pm on a Tue - but when the food came out 5 mins after ordering, it was excellent. 

Other points:


1. My entree was $12 but they wanted cash - bring cash

2. These people are great cooks first - if the reception seems cold at first when you walk in speaking English, ignore it. They're not really selling - they're just real.

3. This is the first time I opened a fortune cookie to find it empty. That freaked me out. My gf says it means I now get to write my own fortune. I don't know, sounds like something Jules would tell Vince in that breakfast scene in Pulp Fiction."}
{"text":"Si vous travaillez à la Place Dupuis ou au environ du métro Berri c'est un des meilleurs spot pour les jours où l'on a oublié le lunch à la maison. Les pho y sont très bons mais parfois légèrement trop salé. Les grillades accompagnées de vermicelles sont délicieuses. Je ne suis pas fan des rouleaux impériaux car ils ne goûtent pas grand chose. Idéalement appeler en avance pour le take out car ils prennent habituellement une quinzaine de minutes."}
{"text":"I've ordered a bowl of Pho for takeout. Not the best but enough for me to enjoy a warm soup during winter. Waited 15 min. for my order...might want to call them beforehand. Overall, it is a decent place. Staff are friendly. If you find yourself in this area and want a warm bowl of soup, give this place a try as this is the only pho place I believe."}
{"text":"Food was great! I hard the shrimp Tom Yum soup, which was delicious. Prices are great, most items are under 10$ and the plates will fill you up quickly!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai qu'essayé que la soupe tonkinoise. Mais quel délice! La toute garnie est différente des autres restaurants vietnamiens. J'ai particulièrement aimé le croquant de je ne sais quel morceau de viande présent dans la soupe. Le bouillon est bon. L'intérieur du restaurant n'est pas très charmeur, mais la soupe a un goût à vouloir y retourner.
Les heures d'ouvertures ne sont pas les mêmes que celles affichées. Me suis cognée le nez à une porte fermée et ça devait être ouvert un jeudi après-midi vers 2h"}
{"text":"Sur Maisonneuve, à travers les travaux qui jonchent la rue, caché se trouve ce petit mais oh combien sympathique restaurant. Les décos sont vraiment mignonnes avec le feu de foyer et l'immense aquarium avec les immenses poissons qui attirent l'oeil. Combinaisons poulet grillé à la citronnelle avec riz, servi avec soupe Tonkinoise, un rouleau impérial ainsi qu'un biscuit pour 10.95$ super prix! Et super goût. Je recommande"}
{"text":"came here after haru hana was not opened. this is probably the best pho ive had in montreal. im from toronto so the pho in toronto is top notch and this place is definitely comparable. its not sweet like other montreal pho places or bland, it had proper pho taste. we ordered a beef pho and the bun bo hue on their special menu. i believe the store was supposed to be close for a couple hours during the day then re opened for dinner after but the lady/owner of the restaurant let us in and yay cause it was yummy. they are also on just eat but sadly dont deliver to my area, hopefully they expand their delivery services because i would definitely order from them. would also come back!"}
{"text":"The music that's playing is amazing. I have no idea what's even happening. It sounds like sped up Karaoke. I think the CD they have is scratched. 

The pho was pretty damn decent, and I'm not even that hungry. Really just killing time. Solid broth. Good all around pho. 

And the prices were great for what you get. 

Fun fact: I actually wrote this before I even ate the food. I just had a hunch, then ate, then pressed \"continue.\" When you know, you know."}
{"text":"oh mine... We read Hoang-Khai review, but we were still a bit skeptical about this restaurant, but decided to give it a try.  It was a warm family restaurant, definitely not a chic restaurant for sure.  The food are DELICIOUS and AWESOME.  Ultra fresh ingredient.  Not much MSG, but good food.  Price is great, under $10 for most on the menu."}
{"text":"My Beau dragged me to this little restaurant that seemed to be tucked away in the middle of nowhere. Ok~ maybe it's not in the middle of nowhere and I'm just saying that because he dragged me there at night. We had just landed in from Toronto and needed a place to eat and it was getting late and thank goodness this place was still open!

It's really shady in the area at night as we passed a few zombies (if you know what I mean) to get to this restaurant. The streets aren't that brightly lit around the area either. Inside behind the double doors of this restaurant was a night get away from the chill of the winter. The place seemed clean and well kept.

There wasn't anyone else but us in the restaurant but it was around 9pm, an odd hour to eat dinner. They didn't serve the three bean drink at this restaurant -  I always get at Pho places. Maybe they do have it but I just didn't order it right. But the server did apologize and say that didn't have it.

The Pho here was so good! Better that some I tried in Chinatown. Boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken pho and feels this place had the best chicken pho broth he had ever had. The server was quiet, but was nice and pretty keen on making sure we had enough tea. I left very happy after dinner here ~ even if I didn't get my rainbow coconut drink."}
{"text":"After reading a couple reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try. It was about 12:45 so still lunchtime right? I asked myself why was i the only person there. Shouldn't it be more busy since they are right next to Place Dupuis and other offices. Plus their prices are quote reasonable. Anyways, i always try before I judge. 

Ok. So this is not the best pho in town but not the worst. Especially around this part of town. So i ordered two lunch specials to go. Sorry no pictures this time. I ordered the rare and well done beef pho that came with two imperial rolls. I also ordered the Hu tieu that came with a spring roll. All that for 20$. Not bad! Here it goes. The both broth were ok since you can taste the msg quite a bit. Not too overwhelming but just enough to know that they went a big overboard! The imperial roll could of been better if they hadn't been fried in old oil. The spring roll was nothing to die for. They were generous with the meat portions in the soups so that's good. Would i return to this restaurant? Maybe. I will need to try some other vietnamese/pho places around here..."}
{"text":"Oh no! Is this really the best pho in town? I do like this restaurant! However it's only a 3 star for me. The soup is nice but bland, the noodles are just acceptable. Many lunch combos available. Many rice and non-soup dishes too. I find the food to have a Western taste palette.

Wonderful staff!!!!! Great prices. Quick service."}
