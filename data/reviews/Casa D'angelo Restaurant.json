{"text":"Best lunch in this town. Period. The lobster bisque is the best you will ever taste.  Also the seafood alfredo is to die for."}
{"text":"An aweome restaurant with great food and a great value.  All items on the menu are very tasty, and daily / weekly specials help to keep the selections changing.  Good location, easy to find, friendly statff.   PS.  The house salad / dressing is AWESOME and alone worth going for!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food!! The servings are very generous while the price is very reasonable.  Much better than any of the big chain restaraunts.  The servers are very friendly and courtious. I recommend the in-house made ho-ho cake!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Casa D'Angelo's last night and it was great. Very good real Italian meal. a great mom and pop feel to restaurant was my first thought. Very friendly hostess who knew the menu well. my wife had chicken marsala and loved it. I had the Petto Di Pollo Alla Palermo and it was amazing. And the side dish of grandma's shells are my new favorite dish. And it was cheaper than the olive garden. I was too full for desert. We are going to come here much more often."}
{"text":"Food can be good, very big selection but staff ever since they opened in town are generally unfriendly. A little warmth there would make this a great place!"}
{"text":"Casa D'Angelo Restaurant is by far my favorite Italian stop. I have to give 5 stars alone for their house salad dressing. It is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. but I will get back to that in a second.  When you first walk in you're greeted by someone at the host stand, either a friendly employee or sometimes the owner himself! I'm always brought out fresh bread and constant drink refills. I usually stick with water but I have tried a caramel latte and caramel cappuccino. They're both great to enjoy after a meal if you're not to stuffed from the food! ;)  As far as appetizers go, I have tried the fried ravioli ($6) before becoming vegetarian and it is excellent! It does have meat inside, so I special ordered cheese ones for some of the many catered occasions my family has had. I love the eggplant parmigiana ($7) appetizer because it's a perfect size and a yummy flavor! They're cute little eggplant roll ups filled with ricotta cheese. The breaded mozzarella sticks ($5) are always a good call, too. All prices seem fair for the above mentioned.  The salad is delicious! Normally I prefer all romaine lettuce but I like the mix of romaine and iceberg together with this dressing! They have three different sizes for the D'Angelo salad; a mini ($4), small ($7) and large ($9). If you prefer your own, a mini is the perfect size before a dinner. A small can be shared between up to four people and I'm not sure about the large but it is probably huge! Again, good pricing!   One of my favorite dinner dishes is the manicotti and my favorite sauce is the tomato cream! They swirl marinara and Alfredo together.  On the specials right now they have a grande manicotti. Two jumbo shells stuffed with ricotta cheese topped with green peppers, onions, spinach, mushrooms and a tomato cream sauce. I ordered it without mushrooms my last visit and WOW...I will definitely get that again.   The Alfredo, vodka, verdure and oil and garlic sauces are all delicious in their own way. It really depends on what you prefer. Cavatappi noodles are always fun to eat and provide a good texture to your dish. The spinach and artichoke stuffed ravioli is another favorite of mine. It's served in a spinach and artichoke cream sauce too. Many of my family members have tried this dish and love it! And they have all tried other menu items and have enjoyed them! So there is something for everyone!   If you want something different the veggie flatbread is a must try! The side of lemon dill asparagus is melt in your mouth..delicious. I found out they also carry gluten free pasta. So any gluten free vegan, order some pasta, veggies of your liking, and the oil and garlic sauce..yum. And EVERYONE don't forget a piece of tiramisu to take home! Or a cannoli!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Delicious, authentic Italian food in a great atmosphere. Live music was performed while we ate in the bar on a Saturday night in the summer. I had the spinach artichoke ravioli and wow! Was it good! Others in my group got the stuffed eggplant appetizer, lasagne, pasta primavera, and ravioli-all of them loved their food! The service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"All I can tell you is we have visited many times. Last night I ordered egg plant parm.  The eggplant was so thinly sliced I couldn't taste it. If you want fried bread crumbs this is the dish for you. It was pretty nasty. The meat sauce had no flavor. Our food came cold and I wanted reheated but the waitress never came back. She also never took our drink order. So sad.  Come on people I know you can do better then this. It was really a waste of money."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place but I do have one complaint once you order something its very hard to go back and order something else.......  Its very good food. I always order the Veal Crab - Tender veal medallions with crab meat in a lemon wine sauce topped with mozzarella...  The lemon sauce is amazing. It is a bit pricy but you are going to get a great sized portion. Great Italian food!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. The food is always delicious, always too much and the wait staff is always great. It is a good place for first dates or big groups -- they are very accommodating, and the food is so good. Parking is very easy, and you will never be disappointed with their food."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get how people like this place, the food is blah.  There are way better Italian restaurants in the area.  I went here one time with my wife. We are from the New York/NJ area so we have some experience with decent Italian food and this place doesn't have it.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Sorry, every aspect of this operation is sad. From greeting till paying it was sad. The wait staff seat you so obviously they're going to steer you to their section. wait staff obviously don't  sample the days offerings ( no recommendations ). From appetizer to entree food came way too fast to be freshly prepared  (restaurant wasn't busy ). My veal was tough as shoe leather,too salty and warm,laying on a small portion of cold gravy (obviously reheated). You had to ask for pasta? in an Italian restaurant? This operation is resting on its laurels satisfied with the customers it gets who dont know good Italian food. We purposely went to the front to pay to have a word with the manager but he was to busy taking carry out orders. The waitress we had ran over and took the check from me and said she would take care of it, he's  too busy, and he obviously was because he totally ignored the whole conversation . Outdated decor,Stained ceiling tile,antiquated greet and checkout area. Food that is obviously prepared early and left till someone orders it and to finish this off...if you cant make a fabulous calamari dont call yourself an authentic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Great authentic italian food.  My favorite meal is the pork parmesan with alfredo shells.  If you're looking for good italian food this is the place!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I mean, excellent! Classic Italian dishes done well at a very decent price. It's been a while since I was there, but I remember it being delish, I will need to make a trip there again. Soon. Perfectly seasoned and well prepared. Not a fancy place, but it's okay. Atmosphere..not a lot, but it works."}
{"text":"Ugh. I don't know why I keep coming back. Tonight I got the Quattro Formaggio. It was very bland. My husband liked his manicotti which he also got last time we were here. He didn't feel the lettuce in his salad was fresh. I felt it was just drenched in dressing.  Service tonight was pretty slow. We had to request more bread and our glasses were empty more than once.  Portions were decent and the prices are okay...But for the quality, I've had far, far better at Olive Garden. We now sit here continuing to wait for our check... Again, ugh."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and that is the only reason I keep coming back. I would recommend ordering ahead and picking it up (but check to make sure it's all in there) because eating in has never been the most pleasant experience. They always seem extremely short staffed so you get ignored and everything is so slow.  If only the service could match the food, this could be a great place."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in the area. I am in love with the Spaghetti Parmigiana, total love. Add a meatball for the perfect meal (but just one). The setting is more like a living room than a hotspot, but that adds to the family setting. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to Casa D'Angelo for as long as I can remember.  I really like the salad, although it is a little on the pricey side to add to a meal ($4).  For those who like smaller amounts of dressing, be sure to ask for it on the side.  I used to not really love the restaurant as I seemed to order poorly (I frequently would order from the specials and would be disappointed).  I have since been converted.  If you stick to their main menu, it is pretty hard to go wrong.  My husband likes their Chicken Parm, but I love their Chicken Palermo with Grandma's shells on the side.  I've not eaten for the whole day so that I could eat it all in one sitting!  The interior is a bit outdated, but the service is always nice and attentive and it feels warm and cozy inside.  The waiting area could use to be a few feet larger though.  I've never been when people are essentially left waiting out the door for their table to open up"}
{"text":"The food here is good and we do go here often. This could be a 5 star restaurant, except for the fact that we nicknamed this place \"Farts de Poopalo\" because everytime we eat here we are all gassy and our bathrooms are very busy!"}
{"text":"I and my mate went here the other day. They had only one handicapped parking spot which had no handicap sigh on the wall or pole. We had to park in a spot which was not the easiest spot for a disable person with a walker.   As we walked in we were greeted by a host who was busy writing on a pad. She said, one moment please. We waited patiently and she looked up and said how many 3?, We said two please and before we got a chance to say booth, she says, is this table OK? We both said, A booth is better. She looked around and said, we have a booth in the back of the restaurant, then continued to saying moment it is being cleaned. So my  mate went to the car for a second as the gentlemen who was behind us walked up to the host. She repeated how many He said, 2. She looked at me and told me that our booth was ready.   As we were being seated because of the limited spacing of the seats and tables, it was not an easy task for me to push my walker through the areas as I had to ask people to excuse me and have them to push their chair in. As we finally got to the booth in the back of the restaurant, I asked, where can I put my walker? I expected her to say I'll put it here for you, instead she said,not caring,  that I could put it over, motioning lazily.  We were waiting for our server. After about 10 minutes the server finally came, and ask us if we were ready to order our drinks, as we were looking at the menus. We ordered our drinks. She left and went to other tables. We waited and waited for about another 10-15 minutes before she came back and gave us a cup of water. As she set the water down she mentioned that she made a mistake and we never ordered water, but she would get us correct order....oopppps...  She said I'll be right back with your drinks.   She came back with our drinks then left. We looked at the menus and were talking, realizing the loudness of the crowd in the back of the restaurant. We still had to wait before the server came back and we ordered our meals  and my mate asked her where is the restrooms were and she told him just make a u turn and you will see it. My mate came back and the food was already sitting at the table .   I asked my mate where were the restrooms, and he said around the corner. The girl at the prep station said, there was someone already in the men's room. My mate informed me that the particular men's room was not handicapped accessible. She told us that there was another restroom on the other side of the restaurant which we did not noticed or see before as we were greeted. She was reluctant to show us then decided to try to take us half way there. Again because of the layout it was a bit difficult for me to maneuver to get to the other side of the restaurant. Which had a semi-handicapped accessible men's room.  As we were walking back to our booth, We noticed that the host could have put us in a booth on the side which was called the coffee bar,  but for some reason did not sit us there. However, we noticed the gentleman who was behind us was sat on that side of the restaurant.  We got back to the booth and started  to eat the meals we had ordered. My mate ordered meat ravioli with meat sauce (which did not look like meat sauce) and a mini salad with Italian dressing. The salad was wilted and the ravioli was over cooked and it looked like it was sitting in a warmer for a few days. He said it tasted a bit spongy and the salad was pretty much dead.   I ordered the seafood pasta with shrimp and crab meat in white sauce. Then I ordered the Italian wedding soup. The carrots outnumbered the actual soup by at least 3 to 1. My mate and I took a few bites and then said, we were done. The meals were not very good and made us feel sick to our stomach.   The server came over to check on us, asking if everything were okay. We both nodded yes and she left. The next few minutes she came back and asked us if everything was okay and as we did before, we told her yes. While we were waiting for her to come back again to give us our check. She asked, if we needed boxes for our meals, we said no. She wondered why? We told her we were not going straight home and the food would not last in the warm car. She suggested why not put it in the trunk. My mate responded with I have a hatchback with no cover. She said o..... okay......   On a side note: The best part of the meal was the hot tea and bread. The bread seemed as though it was made fresh in store. If you don't have a bread maker or can't go to giant eagle to buy tea this is a good place.   originally I suggested my mate look at the dessert menu. He read it to me and it was long with many options. We had originally decided on getting some. After the lack of good food we were a little scared to order dessert and changed our minds."}
{"text":"Jimmy D runs an excellent restaurant.  Good food and good prices.  This is not a snobby, serve whatever the current food fad is and double the price kind of place.  It is just good old Italian American Sunday dinner food.  It is a place where everyone can feel comfortable to enjoy a good meal.  You can also sit at the bar before dinner and enjoy a cocktail, or after dinner for an espresso or digestivo.    On Saturday nights, a man plays a Mandolino and strolls throughout the restaurant playing old Italian melodies.  It added a nice touch to our dinner.   I highly recommend them for catering your next event.  They have a very nice menu that is very reasonable for small and large occasions."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:45PM last Friday night and were seated immediately, that is where the positive experience ended.    Upon being seated and presented with the main menu and blue specials menu, our server did not return with our soda and water for over 10 minutes. We asked to place our order, and the server stated she would return with bread.    Twenty minutes later the bread arrived along with the artichoke appetizer.  The appetizer presented as canned artichokes with melted cheese on them.  We ordered 2 seafood pasta dishes, fettuccine alfredo with shrimp & scallops, which was bland and had the tiniest scallops and shrimp in it, and the over abundance of tomatoes had no flavor. The picatta primavera with shrimp seemed to have been made with frozen vegetables (cauliflower, asparagus, broccoli), once again tiny seafood bits and the picatta, was a brown liquid.    The server was not attentive to our table, I waited over 15 minutes when I requested the check. This place used to have quality food and service but has seemed to take a dive. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Casa is a homegrown treat. Every dish is delicious and made from scratch. If you want to add or remove an ingredient, it's all doable. Our server, Jen, was on top of everything and served our giant party of 30 without a problem."}
{"text":"Every time we eat here I ask \"why don't we eat here more often?\" We love a small family owned place like this instead of a chain.   Tonight we had the toasted ravioli app which never disappoints, then we follow with the Vitello Gamberetti Luigi--veal with shrimp in a spicy garlic sauce with a side of Grandma's Shells--fantastic sauces on both. Salad is great as well. Prices have gone up a bit, but online coupons are usually easy to find which takes the edge off the price bump."}
{"text":"Got take out from here. The food was just ok. But the service was terrible. While I waited for the food the owner was chatting up a family waiting for a table. When I asked when asked him if it was ready yet, he told it would be ready when it was ready. I told him I thought he was very rude. My food showed up and he gave it to me and told me to get the eff out of his restaurant. I told him to eff off right back. He said this in front of other customers and his employees. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place...been going there for years.  The food is fantastic.  I ordered the chicken parm (as usual), my wife had the eggplant, my daughter had the ravioli, and all were very good. The side salad was a bit pricey, but very good.  I highly recommend this establishment.  We have had our office parties catered by them also and all went well.  if you are thinking of going to Olive Garden, look this place up.  It is several \"levels\" above Olive Garden.  I would much rather support a family business versus a franchise.  If going on a weekend, plan to wait.  The waiting area is not cozy."}
{"text":"Had a pretty great lunch here today.  New to working in this area and rarely go to a sit down lunch, but this was pretty solid.  I'm giving it an extra half star for having that higher bar, suburban, and local quality.  I sometimes go to 3-4 star yelped places in rural areas that, on occasion, more likely fall into the 2 star spot.  This is a firm 3 and possible 4, depending on returning consistency.  Great salad and well prepared fresh quality in both shrimp and pork pasta entrees I tried.  I will return when looking to impress."}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times recently for lunch and had an ok time. The employees are fast to seat you and get your order started fast. Food is pretty good. I've always gotten penne and salad. Prices weren't too bad either. I like the location but the parking area is a tad small. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch one afternoon and were totally blown away! We got Vitello Picata (veal in a butter lemon sauce) and one of the specials (an eggplant ravioli) and both were absolutely delicious. We live in Cleveland, but plan to stop through again when down in the area!"}
{"text":"very disappointed  friends who live in the area...recommended this restaurant a year ago, for a date i was going to go on -- the date didn't happen, but, last night, i was going to see the opera 'aida,' at the nearby movie theater, and decided to start off a great evening, with a suitably fine meal  very little...was good -- the bread was warm -- soft -- fine tasting -- the cannoli was very good -- delicate,...sweet cream -- soft, flaky pastry  the music was very good -- sinatra, great american songbook, that sort of thing -- beautiful old wedding pictures...on the walls -- large, nicely framed -- well preserved -- i saw at least one...from 1925  now the bad news  i ordered the eggplant parmigiana -- came with a side of pasta -- penne -- the pasta was flooded with sauce, which wasn't...very tasty -- the eggplant...was just okay -- sizable portion, though  i asked the waitress about the appetizers -- i didn't get an enthusiastic response for the interesting-sounding spinach appetizer, but i did get some enthusiasm...for the fried zucchini -- over the past year, i've had fried zucchini in two restaurants in pittsburgh (which, granted, is the capital of friend zucchini) -- so i was keen to try...this -- but, what i got...was no better...than what you get...at a fast-food restaurant, with fried mozzarella -- actually, worse (the breading...dominated the zucchini) -- and the dips...came in plastic cups  even the lambrusco...wasn't...so good -- how can you miss with that  i thought i might end the meal...on a high note...with a good cup of coffee -- cappuccino, latte, whatever -- i asked the waitress how the coffee was -- she didn't encourage me (thank goodness...for honesty -- then, again, who knows -- i struck out with the zucchini and the eggplant) -- so i settled on the cannoli, which was good  the bill -- 28-something -- before the tip  well, the meal...made me wonder  when a person has a bad experience at a restaurant, he's not coming back -- don't they  have people in the kitchen,...somewhere in the restaurant,...who test the food -- taste the food -- the sauce -- before they serve it -- somebody...who'll give...'the thumbs-up,' 'thumbs-down'...for a particular dish -- that this...is of...good-enough quality...to serve -- or not serve  makes me wonder...how such a restaurant could survive  well, the opera...was great -- and i enjoyed a couple rows of a cadbury candy bar"}
{"text":"On our most recent visit (yesterday) we had a very poor experience.  We came with a friend and we expected a wait for Saturday at 7 p.m.  We sat at the bar and had a drink; the wait for the table was about 20 minutes, which was fine.  We got seated at a table in the middle of the dining room (which got treated to a blast of cold air when people came in), brought our drinks over from the bar, got some menus, and sat.  And waited.  And waited.  After 20 minutes of not even having a waiter stop by and say \"I'll be with you in a moment\", our friend went to talk to the bartender.  We got reseated in the room where the bar is.  That waitress was better, at first.  She took our orders, and even put them in before the orders from a party of 12 she was working.  We got our food pretty quickly.  But frankly, the food was not up to par.  My wife and I both got the Fruit de Mar (pasta in seafood).  The pasta was way overcooked, the seafood looked like it had been ground up, so you could not really tell what it was, and the dish was pretty tasteless (I had to put salt on a seafood dish - I suspect the pasta was cooked without salt in the water).  Our friend did like her chicken dish and the appetizers we got were good.  But then the service went downhill again.  We had to wait another 20 minutes after we were done eating before we saw our waitress again, and then it took a while before we got our checks and got out of there.  I was very, very disappointed.  It will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"This place has become my wife's favorite since we moved to Macedonia earlier this year.  They have a wide variety of delicious dinners, pasta, seafood and chicken.  We have been there half a dozen times and haven't had a bad meal yet.  Very good service.  Most meals $10 to $16.  Nice wine selection."}
{"text":"We stop here regularly but I have not updated my review lately. We love this place. Our service is always excellent and the meals are wonderful."}
{"text":"From reading past reviews it looks like other people have had problems with their food/experiences, but I am luckily not one of these people. If you want actualy Italian food, unlike the stuff microwaved and made in bulk at places like the Olive Garden, then try this place. Since I don't live on the east side anymore, I don't go here very often. Because of that, I always get the same thing (since I don't get to get it that often!) I always start with the fried ravoli, which is always cooked long enough to have a nice crisp taste. For my main course, I do the Ianaggi Pollo, which is chicken with red sauce, onion, green pepper, and mushroom (I skip the mushroom). The first time I had it, I craved it for about a month. It's awesome. The past time my sister got a cheeseburger (at Italian restaurant, I know, right!?) which was also actually pretty good (she let me try it!). We also got the tiramasu, which was a big enough piece for the two of us to split, and a perfect ending to our Italian meal.  Never had a problem with the service. It's a small, family owned business. How can you not support it!?"}
{"text":"Loved it! Large portions and good for kids. Pasta was delicious. Tried the appetizer sampler which was really good. The bruschetta was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices are reasonable - I ordered the Cajun cream fettuccini (spicy) very good and I had leftovers for the next day.  The veal park was excellent as well.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"I really wonder if the restaurant owner has padded these reviews. I have now experienced both Casa D'Angelo and D'Angelo's its sister restaurant in Twinsburg. My review of D'Angelo's was none to good. I finally got a chance to eat here yesterday. This place is owned by the brother of the one in Twinsburg as is supposed to have its own flare and look. I will admit the two places look very different. The one in Twinsburg is more upscale while this one is more of a family establishment.  Unfortunately, this one did not fair any better then the one in Twinsburg, in many cases fairing much much worse.  Lets start with the entrance and seating. I went to this place with a friend who happened to be disabled and needs a walker to move.   When we walked in the host/possible manager who was standing at the host stand. Said how many three? Assuming that we were with the other people who were walking in and out of the establishment. Never assume. Just ask how many so you never assume.   Two the host was writing something on an order booklet. It looked like maybe a take out order. Even though there were empty tables the hosts response that will be a few minutes as she finished writing out the take out order by hand.  Side note: This  place does not have a POS system ?!?!?!?!?!?!?. Is this place from the dark ages? The orders are written down by hand and passed through to the kitchen. The register looks to be from the 80's with a separate credit machine next to it.   SO back to the review when the host was done with her take out order she said I have a table right there. My friend asked for a both as it is easier for him to get in and out of. She said well I will have one all the way in the back that they are cleaning off.   We waited a minute or two. And the table was cleaned and back we went....  and then we sat....   and sat......   and sat....   no waiter no drink order... reminiscent of its sister restaurant in Twinsburg.  Finally a young somewhat stressed server came to take our order.  She took our drink order which was a coke and hot tea.  She came back with water?????? \" O, I'm sorry you wanted coke didn't you? I don't know why i brought you water. I'll get your  coke and your tea is on the way.  So she finally got our drink orders and then took our main course order.   My friend ordered a shrimp pasta and a bowl of wedding soup   I ordered a salad and ravioli..   My salad's lettuce looked like it had one foot in the grave. Pieces of it were brown and it tasted as such. It was gag worthy.  My friend's soup was over populated by giant carrots which sucked up the soup and the taste.   Our main dishes came.  I could not eat my ravioli. It tasted like, 1 it i had been sitting in a warming or pot and thusly become tough as nails, 2, like they borrowed their sauce from chef-boy-ardee..., Now this is just my opinion if it is truly cooked fresh fine.  It came very fast for it to be cooked fresh or even from frozen ravioli's.    My friends pasta dish was okay. It was amazingly heavy to the point of not being edible. He said he was forcing it down.   All throughout this the server was barely available. In her section she had a table of five, another table of five, and three tables of two.  the tables of five alone are a big order and as a result she was obviously overloaded. Add to that, that she had to had total the check and was almost forcing us to take our meals home. which we did not want to, it made it not so enjoyable.  Also this place has a coffee bar. Which is a full service section of the restaurant. However, they don't seat there. My friend in a walker had to have half the patrons in the restaurant move their chairs just to get his walker past them. Only  to find a giant handicapped restroom and big open space and seating in the coffee bar. ????   I do not get how this place has perfect reviews.  As I stated many many times I want to get into the restaurant business.  It is imperative that a few things happen to make a restaurant run smoothly.  1. you must have a POS system. It allows the server to not have to leave the floor to enter orders and also keeps track of what table ordered what and how many tables each server has. It will also total the checks for the server and greatly help the owners with the books.   2. You cannot overload your servers. Fine your servers are attractive but if they have too many tables even a super model is gonna be a bad server.   3. Your hosts are the representation of your restaurant. They are the first thing someone sees when they walk in that door. If in the first first sentences that person gives the wrong impression to the customers you can bet their experience from that point on is only going down hill."}
{"text":"Casa never disappoints. Whenever we crave Italian and want to stay close to home Casa is the place. Great food and service. Salad rocks with chicken palermo along with the shells and garlic cream sauce. Try it out!"}
{"text":"We couldn't have asked for a better place to have our rehearsal dinner. Great food, great service, great spot!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group, the service was timely and helpful.  The location is pretty small, but I didn't mind one bit.  The bread they brought out was nothing special, and all they had to serve it with was butter (some olive oil and herbs would have been nice).  Prices were decent and the food was I would say a solid B on quality, it was, however, A++ on quantity. They piled the stuff on the plates, I mean a TON of food.  I had the Pasta Formagia and it was very cheesy as you would imagine. It was satisfying, not delicious, but very filling and comforting.  Pros: Huge portions, cozy location Cons: Nothing spectacular about the food, not a lot of side-dish options, nothing special about the bread."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Italian food and value for your money, well this is not the place Keep driving!!    ( EEEK! MeThinks not).  The interior of the restaurant has seen better days.   The portions were unusually small and of very poor quality, the Chicken Parm contained one dried piece of chicken with no taste a spoon of tomato sauce.   I was charged more for my meal that was printed on the menu (per the manager they have increased their prices a few weeks ago however they have not updated the menus to reflect the increased prices so beware when ordering.....)   The manager was extremely rude with no customer service skills."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always get the linguine tutte mare and it never disappoints! Very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! Looking forward to a nice dinner was too high of an expectation. Not only were we served the wrong food but our waiter abruptly picked up our wrong order without any apologies and slammed down our correct order with no apologies... We especially enjoyed hearing the vacuum cleaner over the music playing NOT! People it's not closing time yet! But it's definitely time to leave!"}
{"text":"Would never think to stop by just driving past, but this place is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small, but has a cute interior. The staff is exceptionally slow- we waited ten minutes to be seated, and twenty to pay our bill! I will admit the food was very good. They have a great selection of pastas, and the cheese bread is delectable. The experience was ruined by the slow service and high pricing though."}
