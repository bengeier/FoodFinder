{"text":"Very solid local pizza place. I ordered the staple cheese and pepperoni. Delivery was punctual. Sauce was delicious--clearly fresh herbs, robust flavor. Generous amount of cheese. Medium thick dough. I'm no pizza gourmet, but I'd definitely get it again."}
{"text":"If you love Pizza you'll love this place. They make their own fresh sauce and only use fresh ingredients. Wings are great and reasonably priced ,too. I wont get pizza anywhere else. . Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Simple localt Pizzaria close to my friend's brand new house in South Park. We ordered in the store and they delivered. The delivery took a little bit, however we did order 5 pies and breadsticks so we shouldn't be complaining. The owner was super nice and easy to deal with. The pies were quite large [we blatantly ordered too much of them]. The breadsticks and the marinara sauce were heavily garlic'd which gave the sauce and interesting offset between sweet and spicy. Will deliver, good local chain. Great people. However, be careful when you drive yourself as the entrance is down a hill and getting back on the street may present a blindspot so watch for traffic."}
{"text":"Tiny pizza parlor tucked way off the road - be alert, you'll pass it right up. There is some seating on the inside but it is clearly a takeout place. The pizza we had had a thicker(almost sicilian thickness) and was a dark brown color on top from being in the oven - something I personally don't mind. The pizza was tasty, and not overly greasy.

They also serve a variety of fried items, which all taste of old fryer oil. The french fries tasted like chicken, which can be good or bad depending on what you're really in the mood for. We also got fried ravioli, which were tasty and full of ricotta. They might have been store-bought, they seemed a little too perfectly presented by comparison. The marinara they give along with them is FULL of grated parmesan to the point of being lumpy."}
