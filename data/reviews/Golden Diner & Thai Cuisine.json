{"text":"This restaurant is very close to home and we always like to support our locals, so we pop in on a regular basis for sit down and take out.   We tend to stick w/ what we know after trying a few things that sounded appealing in the beginning or things that we'd had before. The mixed menu suits a variety of interests which is helpful for families w/ different tastes. The adults favor the flavorful/spicy options on the menu and they are very good at offering extra chili peppers/sauces to suit our tastes  We usually do:  Vegetarian Platter Vegetarian Satay Meal Spicy Basil Tofu Chicken Satay Meal Spicy Cashew Chicken Meal Coconut Mushroom/Chicken Soup Kids cheese omelette Kids pancake  Have Tried (but our preference is listed above): Vegetarian Green/Red Curry Meal Chicken Green/Red Curry Meal Kids Cheese Sticks Deep Fried Pickles Chocolate Chip Pancake Meal  The owners are friendly. We were told by one of the wait staff that the chef used to work at a very large/popular local chain restaurant for many years and so, when we think about how expansive the menu is for such a small restaurant, it makes a bit more sense.   Food is always served up fresh, hot and in next to no time. I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"New owners/operators! Had take out tonight. The Pad Thai and the Red Curry were both excellent. Oh- veg spring rolls too. I'm so happy to find great Thai in my neighbourhood. Yum."}
{"text":"Okay I probably should have known better than to expect authentic Thai food especially if there selling western diner food too! I decided to try this place since its close to the hotel I was staying at. I called for take out and food was ready in 10 minutes. The owner was polite and friendly. The restaurant was empty.   I ordered green chicken curry with white rice. It cost $12 which is reasonably priced. The portion size was huge for 1 person.   Now I don't even know how to explain it but they must have added green food colouring to the curry because it had a weird colour. The colour made it unappetizing and the curry had no flavour. It was filled with lots of veggie and something that looks like chicken."}
{"text":"Well a few of my co workers told me about this place . They said they have an extensive menu , and good breakfast prices .  Being that it's really close to my work , myself and 2 co workers came here Today to try it out for late breakfast or early lunch ...let's call it brunch right .....well I ordered the Salmon Benedict , i was surprised it wasn't Smoked Salmon as I thought it would be which I LOVE ...nope it was one whole  peice of salmon ...yep 3 poached eggs on a whole salmon ...weird eh . Not my fave I can tell you that .  One of my buddies  ordered the burger with poutine  instead of fries ..when it came it was just fries they forgot the poutine part ...the waitress corrected it and brought the poutine ...but the Gravy was cold and cheese unmelted ..well you'd think so considering the cold gravy ....my other buddy ordered  a simple breakfast and was ok . In the end she corrected the price for the cold gravy on poutine ..the server seemed nice and pleasant ..but i don't think I'd go back unless my other co workers  really really wanted to and I was kinda dragged along . Also I have to mention they have WAY to much stuff on the menu .it's a little too m uch and confusing !"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after driving-by for a year and a half, it's a bit hidden behind the gas station. We were the only customers.  My husband ordered Shrimp Pad Thai $8.95, younger kid ordered a kid's plate of Pancakes $5.25, which also included baked cubed potatoes and two scoops of ice cream (enough for 2 kids), older kid ate a bit from everyone's plates (she's a scavenger) and ordered Mango ice cream (two scoops) $1.99. I ordered Veggie Green Curry, which included a side order of steamed rice $7.95.  Portions were very generous, the flavour was alright. I hope that this place picks-up soon. The owner is a sweet lady.. My kids were arguing over who accidentally kicked whom under the table so the owner promptly turned on the cartoon channel haha"}
{"text":"Not authentic Thai food, I've had much better. The steam rice has a weird smell and too smoochy. They use too much sauce and really don't get to taste the food."}
