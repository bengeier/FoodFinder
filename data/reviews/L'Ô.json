{"text":"I picked this place for my best friend's bachelorette party dinner... it was a mistake, and I felt bad about it.  All we could do was move on.  We were all really looking forward to something new and interesting... and good.  I made reservations about two months in advance, so they knew we were coming.    We get there, and it turns out they have private rooms for bigger parties.  But those were all taken.  So they had to clear off their high-top table... and we had to wait.  Isn't that why we make reservations?  So they know we're coming?    Anyway, onto the service.  Our waiter took his time getting to us, although we had no menus to study so we just stared around the restaurant blankly.  Finally we got some drink menus - but they offer nothing we're interested in.  I opt for some raspberry champagne drink, some girls go for a simple bloody mary, others order something exotic off the drink menu.  But they have no flavored vodkas, no whiskey of any sort.  Just lots of wine.    Drinks came out about fifteen minutes later - and I am NOT exaggerating.  We watched them be made, and it was a little painful to watch.  I wanted to hop behind the bar and give the lady a hand.  She was sloooow.  So then we get our drinks - but we still don't have dinner menus.  So we have to ask for those.  And then?  Half of it is in French.  I guess I should expect that coming to a French-speaking country, and I didn't really have a problem with it but the ladies I was with sure did.  I ordered a venison and hazelnut appetizer - what came out was cold venison spam with whole hazelnuts gelled into it.  NOT what I was expecting at all.  The description said nothing about it being cold or spam-like.    Sadly, most of us chose either the chicken club sandwich or the burger.  Which is unfortunate because I really had wanted to take my friends out for a great exquisite meal.  Nope.  And don't even get me started on the checks... when I made the reservation I requested that we be able to pay separately.  Apparently no one told our waiter that, and dealing with it took about thirty minutes extra.  No joke."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate dinner at the Novotel hotel restaurant L'O, which was very decent. We were seated at a nice private table away from the bar during a very light service. The complimentary bread sticks were room-temp-to-cold, but came with a small pot of green olive tapenade and a small pot of butter. I ordered the spice-crusted salmon for $20, which came perfectly cooked (crisp outside, moist but firm inside) over a bed of perfectly roasted vegetables and two generous swipes of orange and yellow pepper coulis. Yum! My fiancé ordered the King Burger for $15 which was well cooked and came with a lightly dressed salad and the most perfect French fries. The drinks were a little pricey (a bottle of Heineken for $7) but we got a lovely cup of coffee (with a surprise wedge of chocolate!) for $3.50. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient. I wouldn't mind eating that dinner again soon!"}
