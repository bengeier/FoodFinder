{"text":"Great little spot for lunch! This place is a hidden gem. I used to come here quite frequently when it was known as Sammiches. Same location and similar concept but new ownership and menu. To start, the service was exceptional hence the 5 star rating. Ernst, the chef, and his wife were very accommodating and welcoming. For example, they overheard my gf and I talking about sharing our 2 sandwiches so Ernst went ahead and split it for us and gave us a half of each others' sandwich. How awesome is that? On top of that, his wife offered us free samples of the chili which was an excellent pairing to our sandwiches! They are true professionals. Everything is made fresh to order, the prices and portions are fairly reasonable, and they even let us customize our order to our liking. I'll definitely be coming back to try this place again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich, cute little place. Chairs a little uncomfortable. There not much more you can say about a mom and pop place. Small place but you get the best sandwich in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fresh salad, soup and sandwiches and HOMEMADE desserts - cant beat it! Super friendly - must try it out!"}
{"text":"Their name is no joke. I could not find this place. Ha! It is inside a salon building. Counter space and two small tables only. It is not really a restaurant but a lobby area counter/bar. I really liked it because they had small portions option for breakfast. It is very cheap too. The food was very good. I am not usually a breakfast person and other places give too much food. This is a perfect place for me. The person who worked today was a great, helpful, friendly person. A no frill place they serve on paper plates and styrofoam cups. I will go back to try lunch. I have to say though the cup of water I had was dirty and had some hairs in it. They need to watch that."}
