{"text":"This is the cafeteria in the DNR headquarters. It has pretty standard food, a large menu, and rotating daily specials. Cash or check only.

Please note that this cafe is staffed in part by blind people, so you may need to get their attention sometimes, or tell them what denomination bill you are paying with. Don't let this discourage you from visiting, they're wonderful people doing a good job every day."}
{"text":"A state employee, I had the chopped steak today (9-17-15), because I'd had it before in my own building next door, and it was great.  Unfortunately, I had to stop eating today's version, because it was pink throughout the center.  It is very unsafe to eat chopped meat that is not well done (grey).  This is and has been universally accepted for a very long time.

I called and spoke to the manager.  Although he said I may have a refund (which I'll go in to get), instead of acknowledging the seriousness of the matter, and telling me he'd ensure that all items are properly and safely cooked from now on, he said, \"Well, that's a matter of opinion.\"  No, it isn't.  Grey is grey and pink is pink.  I've worked in restaurants, and I also know the difference between well done and medium-well.  I know the difference between pink and grey.

I wish this gentleman had shown the proper level of professionalism and taken my call more seriously from the outset.  (He assured me, after I objected to his comment, that he \"is\" taking it seriously.)"}
{"text":"This morning, I had an excellent breakfast at a place where the food was hot, tasty, expertly cooked and reasonably priced.  I had the one egg skillet and including coffee.  Nice ambience, too.  I had a pretty view of a courtyard and there was plenty of room to read my paper.

The place is called the Good Day Coffee Shop and it's the best kept secret in Madison.  No, it's not trendy but everyone is welcome and the owners Jo and Tom are there to make you feel at home and wish you a good day!"}
