{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, staff, food and kid friendly. A++ in my book!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The wait time was a little long, but only two servers on staff we were understanding and decided to wait. 
Well worth it! We all ordered burgers. One had the Ultimate Burger his quote: \"Best Burger Ever. Like a French Dip but with a burger on it.\" Another had the Burke Lake BBQ burger his quote: \"It was very good. Reminded me of a local sandwich back home.\" I myself had the All-Day Breakfast Burger and I HIGHLY recommend it. The fried egg, the hash brown, the maple syrup aoili, and even the hot French fries were all delicious. Being a Tuesday evening before a concert I can't attest to their weekly operations, but if we come back to The Flats we will be coming here!"}
{"text":"Horrible !  We took our out of town family there for lunch.  Service was slow and the restaurant was half empty.  When the food finally arrived, my husbands lunch was over cooked and was unedible....my sons food had hair in it  and the manager never approached our table .  We will never go back !"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! 

I went there for lunch today because I had a guest from out of town I wanted to impress with good food and a beautiful view of Cleveland and the waterfront. I got neither. We asked for outside seating on this beautiful sunny day and were told it was closed. Also, our simple food order took over 40 minutes. I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and my guest ordered the Walleye dinner entree, which was listed on the lunch menu given to us.. We told the waiter that we were on a time-line as my friend had to be back to a conference event in one hour. He assured us it would not be a problem. As time moved on, I had to ask the wait staff 3 separate times to please check on our food. Eventually it arrived and we only had 10 minutes left to eat. Further more, we received the Walleye sandwich, not the dinner. What we had ordered included a vegetable side and choice of potato. The sandwich came with cold fries and no vegetable side. There was no time to complain, so I paid the bill and we left. I could not also help to notice that an automatic 18% gratuity had already been added to the bill. There were only 2 of us! How rude to add the tip automatically with a party of 2, especially when the service was terrible and the food took too long and the order was wrong. I did not make a fuss as we did not have time and I did not want to do it in front of my guest, BUT I WILL NEVER RETURN and I will never recommend this place again!

P.S. After all that, I went home and made myself something to eat, cause I was still hungry!"}
{"text":"Only people that have duschbag syndrome go to this nasty place . It should be leveled after this summer! Terrible food, terrible service and nasty low life people hang out there!!"}
{"text":"Food was AWFUL and the Service was even worse.  Refuses to accept a groupon that didn't expire for over a year.  They claimed \"it just looks a little different.\"    The on duty manager was on a serious power trip and was so rude.  This place deserves negative infinity stars.  I'm not kidding, worst food I've ever had.  Wayyyyyyyyy overpriced.  An appitizer and 2 drinks cost me $32.  The manager told me (no joke here) he doesn't give a f**k, so get out because there will be 4000 people here tonight.  You can't make this stuff up people.  

I am currently feeling so sick from the food right now I may puke.  Terrible."}
{"text":"A definite improvement over the last few years. As the city of Cleveland is on the rise with people and money, shooters is riding along. The last few years shooters went downhill, ( so did most of Cleveland) when it comes to services and execution of food. Their atmosphere is fun, and you can still dock boats there ( not as much as before, but still fun).    

The food improved over the years, their burgers, pizza's, calamari, and most appetizers are great and have a fair price. The drink selection is decent and they  have anything a regular club/bar has. 

Their service can be very slow, even with a huge staff. The outside patio is a lot of fun especially with live music. The scenery can be gorgeous with a nice sunset and good music.  

Overall I do not enjoy the people at shooters or the music. I like to go there for live music and or to dock the boat. I would not go out of my way to head to shooters any night of the week. If there is less people the better. Biggest upside of the whole area is, that you don't have to worry about getting robbed while walking back to your car."}
{"text":"Service was very slow though it didn't seem particularly crowded on the Saturday night that we visited. We had burger/fries and panini/fries and the food met expectations. Still, we had a nice time because of the entertaining band and the location on the water."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. Thugs, terrible service, terrible drinks, over priced, and they even charged a $5  cover charge to get into this dump. The best part of the experience was when a fight/riot broke out between 20-30 of the thugs. I agree with many of the other reviews that this place should be leveled."}
{"text":"Terrible food,  drinks,  and service,  but I'll go back anyway because they have a patio by the water and good events. Park on the street for free."}
{"text":"I used to come here every Sunday when I lived in Ohio. I loved the reggae and the good people that gather to see it. I came from 6 hours away on August 23rd to check out Carlos Jones and the P.L.U.S. Band. I had a great time and the service was as good as it could be with that big of a crowd. I really miss you guys having The Ark Band playing there. They were awesome! Hopefully you guys can fine tune that relationship and have them back next year. Until then, positive vibrations and one love from Baltimore!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!  We went on a Sunday evening on Memorial Weekend and had a great time.  They open up all the windows so you feel like you are on a dock.  This overlooks the water and many boats pulled up to dock and grab a bite to eat.  I had the Canadian walleye and shared the crab with my boyfriend.  We also got the cheesecake and apple pie desserts which were both great!!  Really fun atmosphere with the live band as well."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!  Was in town for the weekend checking out the Flats for the first time. Spent all of Saturday on the east bank and had a great time with great food and service. Sunday we decided to hop on the water taxi and check out shooters because the atmosphere looked so fun

The  Customer Service was HORRENDOUS!  We ordered a ribeye steak medium, when brought to our table it was WELL DONE. Instead of just cooking us a new steak like we asked our waitress and another waiter came over and said it was the lighting and put his flash light on his iPhone and shined it on the steak... ummmmmmm what??  So we asked for the manager and next thing we know someone from the kitchen came out and showed us a picture on the menu of what medium looked like. Yea Sir I have ate steaks before and pretty sure I know what Medium looks like, wish I would have taken a picture of it. The cook was VERY angry as he grabbed the plate from our table and stomped away.  So now 3 people have argued with us about the steak basically telling us they did nothing wrong and just eat it!  FINALLY a manger comes over with an attitude immediately (mind you the whole time this was happening she was over in the corner watching everything) She does nothing but argue with us so we asked that the steak be removed from our bill and we needed the bill so we could leave. 

I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER go there again. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS KEY TO SUCCESS and I'm surprised they are still in business as I have heard they have been there for years... Who ever the owner is please clean house and hire some staff who actually care about returning customers."}
{"text":"I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised!   A few Cleveland natives who said, \"Let's go someplace on the water to eat.... haven't been down to Shooter's in about 15 years and it was kind of crappy back then, but what the heck, it's got a nice deck on the water.\"
So off we went to Shooter's expecting so so food and a nice view.  Well we arrived to a great band that had just set up, easy seating and my husband, who got BBQ ribs, said they were the best ribs he'd had in ages, anywhere!  I had Ahi tuna which was overcooked, when I had ordered it rare, but again, this is Shooters, so my expectation was that it wouldn't be that great.  Everyone else's meals were very good and drinks were great.  Service was very accommodating, even though we were told to seat ourselves on the patio and when we couldn't find a seat on the patio and seated ourselves inside, we were told that we couldn't seat ourselves.....well yes on the patio, but not inside.  The accommodating part is the waitress who brought this to our attention, but said we could stay seated and they would wait on us instead of ignore us (which is standard practice for others who \"seat themselves\").
Also be warned.. it was Saturday night and at 7pm they stop serving food on the patio and whisk all the tables and chairs away to make room for standing crowd only.  Kind of disappointing if you were hoping for a later dinner and watching the sunset.  Or just sitting at a table having a drink overlooking the east bank of the flats.
I think my 4 rating is based on my amazement that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be,  but I guess maybe a 3.5 is more in order.
*Keep the tables on the patio out!!"}
{"text":"3 stars only because they still have a good Friday/Saturday summer crowd. The food is very overpriced and pretty average. It is actually really sad going here as you can tell this used to be the place to be. I remember in the 90's when they had the hot tub out on the deck!  Remember when the Hoop it Up tournament was down there?  

The decor is old, and as someone said it probably hasn't changed since they opened in 1987.  They still have the huge back deck overlooking the water with the stage.  There isn't anything to look at anymore!  Just piles of gravel and half torn down buildings across the river.  On a positive note, on a  warm summer weekend night you can still count on a good crowd!"}
{"text":"Went there before a concert at Jacobs Pavillion. It was busy, but nothing out of the ordinary for a restaurant. Our waiter showed up and told us to expect a 20-30 minute wait for food. We placed our drink and food order together. After almost an hour I got up and asked for a manager. The hostess disappeared for a minute and came back to tell me that the manager was too busy to help me and to please call her and leave a voicemail...We ended up leaving before our food ever came. Extremely disappointed as this was a place I went to often growing up in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend on Memorial Day and we decided to go there ,view is good I guess that's how they are doing business there ,cocktails are not fresh and they use cheap flavor said and mix ,we ordered salmon burger ,Greek salad,nachos ,regular burger and I was going to order a $35 a steak I am so lucky I didn't ,just I can say food is Garbage ,nachos how hard to make it good ? Chips are not fresh topping was ok,salmon burger was so dry ,Greek salad was terrible I just enjoy my bottle Heineken ,and I paid large amount of bill for that quality ,and I talked with my friends who live in Cleveland they said the same thing ,this business survive becouse of the people from out of town !"}
{"text":"We go here any time we are in Cleveland for something but only in the afternoon and gone by 6:00. We've never had dinner. We do get an appetizer usually the nachos which are tasty and colorful, reasonably priced and plenty for the 2 of us.

The ambiance in the summer is just the best in Cleveland so far. Watching the boaters and the bridge, the cruise ships and the freighters is so relaxing and interesting. Somewhere around 4 a band starts, they have always been blues or summer type, never too loud. The drinks are good, the beer selection is plentiful. 
Yep one of my fave places in Cleveland but maybe not for the usual reasons..."}
{"text":"The view of the water was the only good thing about this establishment. Service was terrible. Food was mediocre. I will not be back. Poorly managed. I do not recommend.  There are so many other great places to eat in Cleveland besides Shooters!"}
{"text":"This place could only possibly warrant two stars if you managed to go here and hook up.  And the only reason that is possible is that there aren't enough worthwhile nightclubs in Cleveland, leaving this as a last resort.

Yes, it is on the water.  You could go down to the Lake and drink at wholesale prices out of a brown paper bag.  The ambiance will be nicer and the company more intelligent (seagulls).

I have been here twice.  It looks like it was probably pretty nice in 1990.  Unfortunately I was not old enough to drink then.

My drinks here were totally normal, but I'm not foolish enough to drink here on my own tab, so who knows what the value level was.  Bartenders seemed fine, but I feel sorry for them.  No one here is coherent enough to tip well."}
{"text":"Douchetastic!  I do like being by the water and people watching here.  Brings back memories of youthful idiocy.  Good in small doses.  Nice place for lunch actually during the laid back daytime hours.  Food is nothing to write home about but I can always sit by a river and feel good."}
{"text":"As far as I am concerned this is the best place in the flats !!  I go there fairly often. The food is very very good, the scenery, including of course the view of the lake/river, is excellent (best in the flats) and I have never had a problem with the wait staff.  I am genuinely surprised at some of the reviews that seemed less than excellent.
  I will need to leave the reviews of the entertainment to others as I rarely go down for entertainment . However, when I have I have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were enjoying a drink out on the deck outside, on a Friday night and was told to take my hat off for security purposes. They want to be able to see your eyes with the security cameras. So with that being said, I avoid going here, because my impression is, that they probably have a crime problem and the food is horrible!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the warehouse district/Cleveland for almost a year (getting ready to move out of state) and I finally made it to Shooters on the Water. I actually came here twice in one week. My first time was Tuesday following a little kayaking. (We didn't have to pay to park as we didn't know any better and parked in Christie's lot.) It was a warm night, but my friend and I found two seats at the bar. We both ordered the broiled walleye- it was delicious! The sauce it was in was so tasty and it came with veggies and another side. The view was breathtaking of the sunset and downtown!! The second time I came to Shooters was Saturday for lunch; another nice hot day. The place was packed and we paid $5 to park. Both patios were opened and we easily found a table with an umbrella. The calamari (no bodies with tentacles) was tasty and it came with three different dipping sauces (marinara, sweet and sour, and a tarter of sorts). I had the lunch portion of the goat salad. It was a perfect size and so tasty! Lots of goats cheese and candied walnuts! Others in my party had the pulled pork and a cheeseburger, and they both enjoyed these. It was a great lunch watching the boats, trains, and the bridge go up and down. Reasonable price compared to other restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to be proud of Shooters, being the lone survivor of when The Flats collapsed more than ten years ago. But not now. It costs $10 to park, and if you arrive after 9, there is a cover charge. So, for a party of four, it could easily cost you $30 just to get in the door. It is at a very nice location, the architecture is very nice, and the scenery is great, but the clientele are now middle-age frat-boy boat owners. You know the type. I've given up on the place."}
{"text":"This place was prime back in the day... When I didn't know any better . The food here is awful, service is slow at best, and the people watching is tacky as hell. I cringe when my friends say let's go there on a boat... It's just not worth it!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 stars, I would. I'm not sure that the price is worth the service you'll receive. I had a waitress, not sure of what her name is...but she had reddish purple hair with glasses and star tattoos on her neck. She seemed like she could've cared less if she was at her job, and was doing an awful job at hiding that. The way she spoke to not only my table, but to her co workers was unacceptable! Maybe this is why the place was dead on a Saturday afternoon (3/31/2018). Tip for owner/manager: hire people that enjoy coming to work and not making others miserable being there!"}
{"text":"Food was great and timely. Our server on the other hand wasn't that great. He preferred to service another table over his other tables. Also, drink prices are crazy expensive 9.75 for a piña colada that barely has any rum??? Seriously? Smh."}
{"text":"Went to Shooter's on Friday evening with some friends.  We arrived around 8:00pm, and the place was completely dead.  Sat at a table near the patio for a couple hours to chat and have drinks.  Waitress wasn't very friendly.  We decided to leave around 10:30pm when she kicked us out of the table, but it looked like the crowd was just starting to pick up at that time.

I wish this place were better.  The location and patio are fantastic, but the menu is blah and boring, and the whole facility is in serious need of a makeover.  As much as I lament the wasted potential of this space, I'll probably continue to go back once or twice a summer because its patio just doesn't have any competition in Cleveland.  

Beware the beers are expensive though.  $8.25 for a 22oz Landshark!  And $10 to park yikes."}
{"text":"Had a great time at shooters. The food was great, the people were respectful and  the bartender CHRIS was amazing"}
{"text":"I wasn't entirely impressed with Shooters. I really had no idea what to expect when coming here, so don't make fun of me for being a tad bit offended by the hostess and servers' booty shorts and sneakers. And don't make fun of me for hating the layout of the place and feeling like we were in a deserted corner. 

We came here with a party of something like 10 people. I only remember what my end of the table got, thus I only remember three dishes...and I only ate one of them, so there's that. We ordered beers and the three of us at this particular end of the table all got Great Lakes Dortmunders. The first two that came out for the boys were covered in a massive blanket of foam. We ended up with a designated \"foam plate\" onto which the ice-creamy foam was scooped and abandoned. My beer came out alright, not an immense amount of foam, so maybe the extra foamies were a fluke. Who knows. We'll probably never know. 

Unfortunately, we were here well past dusk, so we didn't get a very good view of anything and the temperature had dropped significantly, so we couldn't get a quick visit on the deck either, which I would have liked. As we waited for our food, everyone kept commenting that it would turn into a \"club\" at 9 or 10. That never happened and I think I'm thankful for that...

The food was impressive from what I heard. My summer salad was tasty and I ate every bit of it. The strawberries and cherries were perfect and the spinach was crunchy, so I couldn't complain. Even the garlicky-baguette-bread that came with it was pretty good. The rest of the food looked pretty delicious, though the prices seemed out there for what was served. I hear that's because of the view that we missed out on...? I did have a couple of fries which were delicious enough for me to consider coming back for more, but it's just not convenient or worth it to me.  

I wish the flats were still thriving, but that's just not the case. And with a place like Shooters being one of the \"bigger\" attractions, the future for the flats doesn't seem so bright either."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Denver, we loved the food and the staff. The calamari was amazing and the staff was kind and gracious. Such a fun place and the other people we met were amazing as well. Thanks for a great finish to our great trip!"}
{"text":"Awful, doesn't even begin to capture the experience of going to Shooters.  The service is abysmal and the food is all frozen, cheap fast food.  The decor has not been changed since the day it opened.  As bad as the restaurant it's even more egregious when you look across the river and see the East Bank restaurants that are awesome.  There is nothing redeeming about this restaurant; avoid it at all cost."}
{"text":"Don't come for the food but the atmosphere! Though we all had delicious choices(even if  they 86'd two of our orders) I will return if ever I get back to Cleveland on vacation just to see the freighters turn the corner right over the railing outside."}
{"text":"I can really only review the MASSIVE outdoor deck because...well....why else would you go to Shooters? 

Shooters is sort of the local legend that gets responses when you bring it up. These responses could be as simple as \"great view\" to one more complex and anchored in Cleveland's economic hardships.  I recently mentioned to a friend in his late twenties that I was headed there on a sunny Friday afternoon and he said \"that place from the nineties?\" Sure, the flats were HUGE in the 1990s, but the reality is that Shooters is still vital and great place to meet friends or bring out of towners. 

Highlights: 
On the river and overlooking the lake
2 level deck
you can dock your boat OR watch boats come in!!!
live music from an elevated, outdoor stage 
live dj on weekend nights
HUGE portions"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Shooters it was circa 1994 in the summer.  The deck was packed and I was d-runk.  Fast forward 16 years to last night... I went there with a date to sit outside and have a few drinks.  Keep in mind it was a Wednesday night...but there were 5 other people on the deck and at 8:30pm they said, \"Last call.\"  Huh?  It's a shame this place cannot get its act together and run some specials to at least attract people during a weeknight.  Lest I forget to mention that there were 6 servers working but you still had to go inside to order your drinks.  Come again?  Nah, don't think so."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, right on the water.  Food and drinks are amazing    Food comes out hot and quick..   Sat at the outside bar and the bartender Chris was amazing, great customer service, very personable, friendly and funny.   Had a great time here, will definitely return and ask for Chris!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that this review is based solely on the night scene, Saturday night to be exact. I haven't yet had any food here, and there are a lot of bad reviews for the food, so I'll probably keep it that way.

The drinks weren't overpriced, I don't know why there are so many reviews that say this. I found that the prices were similar to any other bar. The drinks weren't watered down either. But hey, maybe I lucked out and the four different bartenders that served me drinks just happened to be the four that were cool? And if you get a drink with too much ice, which I didn't, ask them to go light on the ice next time around. Bartenders are pretty chill if you're just a normal, nice person to them.

I think one of the important things about any place, Shooters included, is the people in your entourage. Yes, there are definitely some people at Shooters that you'd like to push in the water and forget about, but you find those people at every place. Focus on the people with whom you showed up, and have some fun. 

The DJ this past Saturday was fantastic, playing a great mix of genres from the past 10 or so years. It was a constant, upbeat dance vibe, and everybody was having fun. The place was absolutely packed.

I'll definitely go to Shooters again. We'll see if my experience is the same!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times during the summer hoping for a better experience but been let down. Went there on a Saturday for lunch, first it wasnt that busy, service took a long time, staff didnt know what they had, when the food finally did come out it was cold and not that good. For the same amount of money you could of went to a better place near West 25 for at least local and craft food and beer. It seemed everyone there had little experience. Second time i went it was a little busier this time just for a drink, sat at the bar never acknowledged or greeted, then when i asked for a drink he told me it be a minutee, 20 min later no drink, I left.
Overall apparently this place has seen better days and with the new east bank on the flatts i dont think will survive long.,"}
{"text":"I took my son and his friend here,  before a concert at 5 pm on a Tuesday.  We waited 5 minutes at the door before someone noticed we were there.   We sat at our table for another 10 minutes before our server came over and aknowleged us. . I paid $9.75 for a horrible mudslide that was served in a plastic cup and was a runny mess.  My son ordered the chicken Alfredo he said it tasted ok,  but the presentation was horrible.  His friend ordered the shrimp Alfredo same thing tasted decent looked like a child thru it together.  I ordered the French dip it was good.  My waitress finally brought me the ice water i requested several times and seemed annoyed i kept asking.  We will not be back, it's to pricey to have such bad service and so-so food. ..can't imagine if they were actually busy."}
{"text":"Although I absolutely love the location and set up of this bar and how nice the servers are,I am disappointed by some of the service. 

I went for the second time yesterday, asked to be sat outside on the patio & was told the patio was closed because at 9 it turns into a dance floor...I asked to be sat there around 630, so they close their patio 2.5 hours before they change it into a dance floor. After deciding to sit at the bar, I watched them seat AT LEAST 6 more tables outside on the patio, so I was very upset over this. 

Then it took 10 minutes to even get a bartender to come over to us, the 5 of them behind the bar just kept chatting and looking at us before they decided to come talk to us. While my boyfriend and I did enjoy our sandwiches/wraps and calamari, the bartender first gave our calamari to the ladies next to us and then gave us their calamari (there are two different types of calamari on their menu). Just observing the bartenders, they messed up a few other groups orders, forgot to put in orders and just rarely checked in on us. 

We continue to come back just for the location, customer service needs to be worked on a little more to really thrive."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places to go for local summer fun. We decided to go last week for the airshow. I was sadly disappointed. The host never greeted us, we walked in to see if there was any outdoor seating since she was not able to acknowledge us for indoor seating. As expected it was packed for the airshow-no biggie-there was plenty of space inside but due to being under staffed they could not seat us right away.  No worries, I get it so we went to grab some drinks. The bar was out of most of their liqueurs and draft beers. In fact when we asked for a drink menu we were told , \"do not go off that because we don't have 80% of it\". The service was slow for 4 bartenders being behind one bar. I get it is a holiday weekend but it was a little muc. I will go back again because I like the atmosphere but did not have a good experience this time around."}
{"text":"Ahhh Shooters, the last of dying breed.  I remember when the flats was kicking and we used to take the Holy Moses Water taxi from one side of the flats to the other.  And no matter what, Shooters was always packed.

We came here with some friends from out of town, to enjoy some drinks, food and the view.  It is always fun to watch the jet skiers down the river, or the bridge going up and down to accomodate the larger boats.. and if you stay long enough you will see a train go by.  If you can look past the rubble of what use to be clubs and bars, the Cleveland skyline doesn't look so bad either.

Now, the food left a bit to be desired, but we stayed there longer than any other resturant that week.  Just the atmospher and good drinks, we felt at home and had quite a good time.  

You can sit indoors or out doors, just don't be too surprise to see all the junk floating in the water if you over look the rail.  Somewhat sad, but not Shooters fault.   There are bars both inside and ouside on the deck.  We sat indoors due to how hot it was, but the big windows still provided the views described above."}
{"text":"I went for a nightclub event and it was soo soo much fun.  Plenty of people to talk to and good music.  I'm pretty sure it all depends on the event hosts/ entertainment group.  

The decor of the place seems to be a little outdated and not as up to date as the other clubs around.  Although I do really like their large glass windows and deck.  The dancefloor is also a little small for my liking.  THE DECK IS AMAZING AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR SUMMER DOWN THERE.

The drinks were around the same price as the other clubs down there- roughly 7.00 per shot and 6-8.00 per a normal drink.  The drinks were nothing special or phenomenal. 

Go for the scenic views of from the deck and the large panoramic views from the dance floors.  If you get bored you can always go next door to Christie's ;) hahaha"}
{"text":"What do you expect from a restaurant named \"Shooters?\"  Not much.  But I was surprised on two accounts: one good, one very bad.
The good: the food was pretty darn good.  It exceeded my expectations for a place called Shooters.  The service of taking our orders and delivering our food was fine, acceptable.
The bad: we sat on their deck looking at the rejuvenated \"Flats\" of Cleveland; a great view.  It was a nice place to sit until a neighboring table finished their meal and left.  Within two or three minutes the seagulls flew in and engulfed the table gorging on leftover fries and sandwiches and generally making a huge mess of the place.  At first the waiters just stood there watching, then, as the seagull melee worsened, the wait staff disappeared!  Fearing we'd be crapped-upon, it was up to me and my table-mates to shoo the birds away and get the table cleared so the seagulls won't come back.  Not a wait person was to be seen until all the food was removed from the table.  What the hell is up with that?!
This is definitely a place that does most of its business at its four or five bars, and though the food was good, the overall experience was one to avoid.
Go there for a drink, but don't expect good service...if nothing else, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Positive:

1. Plenty of spaces to sit ranging from inside to numerous outside spots. 
2. If you get here a bit earlier and are going to Nautica you can avoid the parking fee and also get out a lot quicker than the cars in the lot directly next to Nautica. 

As far as positive, that is all.

Negative

1. VERY slow bar service. They were completely understaffed and we actually had to go to every bar to find the bottle of wine we were looking for because the bartender wouldn't do so and neither would the manager. Unacceptable. 

2. I ordered a coke and she also gave one to my friend who did not order one. She said, \"here, I got one for you too\". She then charged us for 2. Again, unnaceptable and dishonest practices right there. 

3. Our friends shared a buffalo chicken pizza and got charged the price of the pizza + $4 for chicken.....it's a chicken pizza, figure that out. It took forever to get it fixed and then they couldn't even show them the first transaction was voided. The bartender than just walked off mid conversation. Such a mess. 

Food and drinks: NOT WORTH IT. The moscato is disgusting, the beer list is lame- not even Guinness?? And the pizza we ordered was far from good. 

OVERALL: Maybe a place to stop pre-concert because of convenience but overall, I'd avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Have you ever watched an 80s movie set in Miami and thought \"wow that looks just like Cleveland!\" Me neither. Although the vibe of the place is certainly a bit outdated, there are a lot of things I liked about it. I have been here three times and each time got a worse. 

The first time I went in, it was a beautiful summer afternoon with a band playing. There were about 7 of us and we were standing at a table by the water and getting our own drinks from the bar. The Margaritas were good as well as the bloody Mary's. Everyone was friendly and bar staff seemed very happy. On top of that the band was great.

The second time I was there was for some late-night fun. There were 2 bars open on the deck, but both were moving really slow. The male bartenders were a little preoccupied talking to the pretty girls at the bar, which I expected, but I still would like a drink every once in a while.

The third time I went was the worst. It was again another late night, but there was a private party. The place was packed, but I didn't feel I was waiting too long to get a drink. My problem this night was the crowd and lack of security. Although apparently drug use isn't a big deal for many, I don't want an entire bar to smell like Cheech and Chongs van from Up in Smoke.

Overall, Shooters is a great spot for summer afternoons. Apparently when the night crowd starts rolling in, you can't expect much. The drinks are a bit pricey for the area, but I think it goes along with the fact that you can pull your boat up to the dock and drink by the water. So, if you want to feel like Tony Montana at the Babylon Club in 2016 Cleveland, head to Shooters!"}
{"text":"I would rate it no stars if possible. Once a crown jewel on the West Bank of the flats had become a sad disappointment. We stopped in after a show at the improv next door. There were less that 6 tables sat and no bar business. We did not get greeted for 15 minutes and then waited an additional 30 minutes for my drink. We decided not to eat because if the poor service. 
I brought my concerns up to the manager as we were leaving and he blew me off making excuses. I will not go back. Thanks for ruining our date night."}
{"text":"Fun Sunday afternoon. We stopped for a few drinks and an appetizer. The weather was beautiful so we sat outside at the back bar. Nachos were good. Ingredients were all very fresh and we were served very quickly. Matthew the bartender and the bar-back(didn't catch his name) were friendly and fun. We had a nice time for a busy 4th of July weekend."}
{"text":"Holy slowness third time here. waiting for a server now 20 mins then our salads come before our drinks which is now beyond 20 mins after ordering. For these prices!  This place really needs to improve service quick.."}
{"text":"The only reason I have it one star was because the food was great tasting, but was horribly overpriced ($14 for a burger!?), horrible service, very very bad service. Seemed like I was doing more of her job for by reminding her that a refill to my water would be great, or that I'd like to order food."}
{"text":"Shooter's is not the kind of place I can hang out regularly, frequently, or even often.  As a \"once in a while\" place it can be a lot of fun.

I think the key is planning ahead.  From time to time Shooter's has some really good bands playing there, and the fact that their HUGE patio is along the banks of the Cuyahoga River make this location fairly unique to CLE.

I know a lot of people complain about the \"type\" of people who can usually be found here, but if you're with a group of friends and ready to have a good time this should NOT be a reason to avoid Shooter's.  That's akin to saying you're not going outside because there's bugs.

The decor is a little outdated and looks like something that Tony Montana from Scarface would have decorated (read:  lots of mirrors).

The food is average to good, and the menu has many seafood offerings in addition to chicken and beef.  The shrimp cocktail was surprisingly good, and the grilled scampi was something that I'll definitely order again.  Oh, and they make a damn fine milkshake."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Shooters in years!  Gone are the days when there were dozens of boats docked along the restaurant and it was standing room only.  The East Bank may be the more \"happening\" side these days but I hope that some of the people give the businesses on the West Bank a try. 
We sat at the bar on a Friday night during happy hour and were taken care of by CJ, a friendly bartender. We both had drinks and burgers. Everything was tasty but a little on the expensive side. The place needs to be updated a bit and the menu could use some contemporary items too. We'll probably be back if for nothing else other than the spectacular views."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to stop between Chicago (home) and NYC (Daughter's). 

The resturant is right on the Cayuga river where it flows into Lake Erie in the \"Flats area\" I love to watch the railroad vertical lift bridge raise for boats and lower for trains. 

My last visit was super exceptional I had the Ahi tuna which was FANTASTIC, watched the bridge go up and down, and Excellent service by Alicia.

{"text":"Like suicide; only not as fun...

THE UP-SIDE:
The only up-side to this horrid establishment is the fact that they allow you to leave.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
The biggest down-side to this hole is that of truly lost potential.  At one point in its ancient history, \"Shooters\" was a great place to dine and hang out.  However, over the past decade or so, \"Shooters\" has become a ghost of its former self.  Expect sub-par food at high-end prices.  Often, the food is served late and cold.  The staff - while friendly - are overworked and appear to be treated pretty poorly by management.  The outside deck has the best view in the Flats; that's not saying much as most of the Flats is a dirty ghost town.  I love Cleveland, but I see nothing wonderful about cramming onto a dirty deck to look out over dirty-brown water toward an array of closed-down nightclubs.  It's damn depressing.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
This place is AWFUL."}
{"text":"I went here with some family and friends... And this was probably the worst steak that I've had in my life this far for the amount that you pay for it.

The steak itself... Overcooked and as bland as can be. I ordered medium and the steak came out completely cooked. There was virtually no seasoning at all on this steak. Maybe a sprinkle of pepper and salt? Totally unremarkable and yet cost $36.

I won't be going back here. I would rather have a steak from Applebee's."}
{"text":"When I was growing up, in Lakewood, Ohio, the Flats was nothing more than a dumping ground...Over the years it blossomed into what it is today...a hip place to go...Mostly bars and such.  
Shooters is one of the nicer places to go for drinks...stay away from the food!!!  Boats pull up and anchor...20 somethings to 60 somethings are all drinking and having a great time, especially on a warm, sunny, Saturday or Sunday afternoon...it is a party atmosphere most of the time and at night...watch out...pick up bar for ladies and men...very, very straight...so, if you are gay...butch it up ALOT...no weak wrists, and swinging your leg, or hands on hips!!!  (Cleveland is still in the dark ages, for the most part...and is one of the many reasons that I don't go back there anymore.)
Anyway, I have always had a nice time here at Shooter On the Water...I just lower my voice and grab my crotch alot."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with a handful of different settings between outdoor waterfront, standard restaurant, two different saloons. The theme is really nice and the portions are large. I had the Ultimate burger and as the name suggests, I was thoroughly stuffed. Beef patty with pulled pork on top."}
{"text":"Although its one of the only places to eat downtown right on the water I can say overall our experience at Shooters was seriously lacking.  The place was clean enough and our server was really nice but the reason I go out to eat is to have food that is different or better then what we make at home.

We were with a large group and had the Edamame and Spinach-artichoke dip.  The Edamame was ok, some of the pods were over steamed and the dip was seriously bland.  It needed pepper, hot sauce, garlic...anything!  My husband and I shared the Shrimp Scampi Kabobs which were around $24.  It included vegetables and a baked potato.  It only came with 6 medium sized shrimps, but worse was how they were cooked.  They were seriously overcooked and seasoned with Rosemary and served with a Mango sauce.  The combination of rosemary and mango was gross and they were super tough.  The \"Seasonal\" vegetables were definitely the frozen variety type and included carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, hardly what I would call summer vegetables.

And to top it off my beer came in a plastic disposable cup.  Now I get that later in the night this place becomes a bar/dance spot...but if I'm going to sit at your table and order dinner I'd like my drink to be in a glass please.

So maybe you love this place for the booze and late night entertainment, but don't waste your time eating the grub."}
{"text":"Awesome venue to hang in the flats...a little run down but if you can overlook the faded  awnings .and worn deck  the view is spectacular and the free music weekly is comparable.  I ordered a goT cheese salad with candied walnuts and fettuccini with grilled chicken .and it was very good despite the surroundings. We paid our bill  a d went outside to listen to a great find..Skinny Moo on the deck... great tap beer ..terrapin a d service to match... can't beT a Cleveland icon despite the conditions"}
{"text":"I have not been to Shooters for about 10 years. The days of 50 boats docked next to the restaurant are gone; so sad. The food however was pretty good.  The service was timely and polite. I got the Phili-cheese-steak and while the meat was slightly dry it could have been much worse; it was 'good'. If it were not for the lake, few boats; and the company I was with I would perhaps remove a start; hard to say.

 I will go back on a Friday night and check out the night-life and update my review."}
{"text":"I highly doubt there is much to say that hasn't already been said about Shooters. It's basic. If it weren't on the water-- I am sure no one would give it the time of day. It's a decent place to sit on the water and have a drink, but that's about as far as it goes. The inside is weird and not a good weird, seems like it may need an update and a new interior decorator. I do like the unique ceiling fans though.I have only drank there, not eaten so I can't contribute towards that aspect. IF I do, I will edit this review but that is a major IF."}
{"text":"Love this place , the food is good with great scenery but the service is terrible anymore . I'm Concerned about this bartender folding dirty laundry on the cutting board ..? Not to mention never washing her hands or wearing gloves."}
{"text":"Very well located for boaters staff was nice and helped us dock the boat.  But the food was very expensive and was just your average bar food. Took a very long time to get food or drinks.  Staff seated us but then none of the waiters knew about us setting there so we waited."}
{"text":"Great location, mediocre to poor food. I can't believe it's so highly rated on this site...I guess because there haven't been many Cleveland reviews yet. Shooters is still alive and popular solely because of its location. That said, it is absolutely a great spot in the summer. Just don't order anything except beer. I would give this place two stars (or perhaps even one star) if it weren't for the location."}
{"text":"It is the outdoor patio/deck that always drew us here - along with the live music, it made for a fantastic recipe on a nice summers evening. 
OK food, but i don't think that's why one goes to Shooters..."}
{"text":"GREAT LOCATION!  GREAT AMBIANCE!  Fun place to get your drink on.

Mediocre food.

When you charge $11-12 for a cheeseburger, it's best not to screw up the temperature.  I ordered a cheeseburger medium (which to me means a warm pink center), and it came out well done (Completely gray center, hot throughout).  Seeing the blue pick labeled \"medium\" sticking up out of my almost burnt burger made me laugh out loud.  

It was infuriating, but I was with a large group and did not want to be the a-hole who complains when all are just trying to have a good time.  Total buzzkill.  In addition, the meat was bland and tasteless, and the bun added more bland and tasteless to the already dull flavor.  A $12 disappointment.

This leads me to another gripe I have with joints using words in the menu to add price to their sub-standard food.

I am sick and freaking tired of reading \"Free range\" or \"organic\" or \"grass fed\" next to a whopping price tag.  If I pay twelve freaking dollars for a gosh-darn cheeseburger, it better be one of the most awesome things I ever put in my mouth!  The patty on my bun was a $2 piece of meat (maybe less, it was too well-done to know for sure), but the BS phrases in the menu upped the price by $10--unacceptable."}
{"text":"Please, someone tear this place down and do something with the land. Or don't.

It's so sad to see aging booze-hounds giving this place four and five stars because of their clouded memories of it being great 20+ years ago. I've only been to Shooters once, and that was plenty for me. 

Service, horrible. Food, disgusting. Prices? Reprehensible. Decor? 1988 called and wants all of its furniture back. 

And wow, it has a patio and it's on the river so I'll give it an extra star! NO.

If you're not going to review this place for the food, then don't review it!"}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday.  Told we had to wait for 20 minutes for a seat with about 30 empty tables.  45 minutes later we left.  Did not have hear one positive remark from anyone that walked by."}
{"text":"What a joke of a place.  Went on a Saturday night and sat at the outside bar.  The staff were more concerned about looking good and chatting with each other and did not give a crap about their customers.   What a sad staff...never saw so many employees turn their back on so many customers.  Hopefully this place will be replaced soon by a place that cares more about their customers experience instead of the quality of their latest tattoo.  
Really is a cheesy place with even cheesier staff...real cheesy staff!  If it was not for their location nobody would go here.  
Pathetic!"}
{"text":"1.5 stars for our experience at Shooters. Went there for dinner over the weekend while at the Brite Festival. We ordered Chicken Tenders and Quesadillas, 4 beers... $92. They were charging $12.50 for a Dortmunder, the festival had $5 312 beers. We waited nearly an hour for our food. This is absolutely not a dive bar and probably will not be back. There are other options to be on the river that will have much better food and will not have outragous prices."}
{"text":"Oh Cleveland

$8 for a tall BUD LIGHT?  Are you kidding me
$15 for a Buffalo Chicken WRAP??

Just because some of the people who go there have money, does not mean you have to charge stupid amounts of money for basic food and basic drinks.  

Atmosphere is cool. 

First time, last time eating/drinking there, will pregame at Eastbank"}
{"text":"There is a positive side to everything and here is Shooters, the Walleye sandwich was awesome. The shooter burger, was delivered as a cheeseburger ( no bacon etc ) and the waiter argued about it. In the end the burger was so bad it went back. The Ahi Tuna was RAW, prefer it warm med rare side, had to send it back. I wanted to drink more from the bar but the waiter really didnt want to come back to our table. He just wanted to quit. He had ALL the waiters yacking in the corner watching him say \"Im quiting, Ive had it!\". As a customer, Im there to show my older kids some fun. I will smile thru and earthquake to make sure our time together isnt spoiled. The water view was horrible, it looked like a condemned construction site. Good Luck to you Blake, I hope you get a job were you are happy. I on the other hand, will never spend 85.00 at Shooters again in my life time OR visit, let alone recommend it to anyone. Just Shoot me and put me out of misery! AND fire Blake, maybe he can find happiness elsewhere."}
{"text":"Drinks we're awful, lots of money too. 
Cranberry tasted moldy, whiskey tasted weird and asked for a redbull and vodka and got monster. Never again! $50 down the drain."}
{"text":"This place can be a little trashy, but is also a lot of fun! They play very danceable tracks and had a really impressive drummer to do all the beats with the DJ when I went. Go for the view on the patio and the opportunity to uninhibitedly get down on the dance floor."}
{"text":"Stopped into shooters for the first time before an event at Jacobs Pavilion and I will admit that it is nice to sit on the water and listen to bands play especially when there is great weather. It was very crowded but our server did a fine job and the wait wasn't bad when you have a group of friends to chat with. 

But, $19.75 for a french dip with coleslaw is a bit overpriced especially when it was just okay. I probably would not come back, maybe for a drink if in the area and want to waste time, but there's just better and/or cheaper places to dine at."}
{"text":"Eleven meals all very nice for the money. Not gourmet but within expectations for this type of restaurant that is really a nightclub. Fresh salads, decent steak, burger just fine. Chicken was from frozen, but what we expected. Service was very good. Moe the waiter was just attentive enough, bus staff was great. Free parking on Sunday appreciated."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see this place on the list of seafood joints because I had hoped it had burned down years ago."}
{"text":"This place needs to fire their entire staff and start from scratch. Gave it about 4 or so tries and each has been a fail. Car was vandalized in the parking lot and they didn't care. Takes forever to sit for borderline ok food. Takes about 15 mins for someone to even say hi once you get your table after waiting 45 mins. Hostess text on their phone before even saying hello. If it wasn't for the location this place wouldn't survive"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. My friend made reservations a week in advance, then called a few days before our dinner to change the hours, only to find that they hadn't even made the reservation at all. The employee then told her that it was possible she wouldn't be able to have a table at all. 

When we were seated, there were plenty of open tables (so the lady on the phone was either confused or just being rude). But all of them were moved about and disheveled. It was a section of the restaurant where it seemed they placed customers of little importance. 

After being seated, we waited around 40 minutes with no interaction by any employee. Finally, someone went and informed an employee that we were waiting. After another 20 minutes, someone finally showed up and took our drink orders. These took so long to come out that half the table went to the bar and got drinks before ours actually came out. Similarly, the food took a long time. We actually watched a table who'd been seated after us (with more patrons) get their food before us. 

The food itself was variable. The Voodoo stuffed peppers were delicious. A nice bit of spice and amazing stuffing. For my meal, I ordered the walleye dinner. The fish was incredibly bland. I actually ended up eating each bite with a bit of pepper simply b/c I hated wasting the fish! 

The waitress herself was incredibly friendly, nice, and apologetic for the slow service. And that was greatly appreciated. The dance floor was well layer out and lively. 

Overall, if you want to get drunk, dance, and hook up, this is a good place. But if you actually want a nice dinner, please look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dance outside and drink yo' face off in the summer.  Catch a ride on the Linda Mae and cruise around the river and lake."}
{"text":"This place was probably jumpin' back in the day.  It really is a shell of it 's former self.  And with street construction taking place around the neighborhood, you will probably spend more time driving around trying to get to this ghetto part of town than actually eating in this restaurant.  And when the 'parking lot attendant' attempts to charge you to park in the run down parking lot, immediately do a U turn and park next door.

I ordered a pint of the Great Lakes Brewing Company and a basket of rings.  After 25 minutes, I inquired as to the status of my order as folks all around me were sitting down, ordering food and getting their grub immediately.  I guess she forgot my order and within ten minutes, my chow showed up.

Great onion rings, loved the local brew.  This place is a dump. just the kind I like.  When I don't get charged for parking and don't have excessive waits for service.

Perhaps the most entertaining aspect of my visit was keeping track of the yellow-jacket stings the servers endured while I sat at the bar.  Seriously.  These chicks had bites all over their legs and arms.  Yellow-jackets EVERYWHERE.  I counted no less than a dozen stings among the ladies.

As I left, I saw McCartys, a local Irish pub and immediately wished I went there instead."}
{"text":"The service at Shooters is atrocious! So many people either bitching or leaving. They have the absolute worst wait staff I've ever seen! I feel sorry for the manager, but didn't she hire &/or train these people? Nice location but NEVER coming back to dine."}
{"text":"This is the only place in the flats that still regularly gets attention from me among others.  Always packed on a Weekend night, especially in the summertime.  You can dock your boat here, and half the bar, about 7000sqft, is outside.  On a nice night, the DJ is outside with dancing, but you can also sit at the tables and hang out.  

Beers are 3 dollars or so, and I also wouldn't recommend the food.
 
At night this place even gets a little rowdy, but that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Shooters on the water...

The food at this place is mehhhhhhhhh...I'd go across the bridge to the other side of the river to find some good food to eat.  This place is humongus and is definitely a nice restaurant, but they seriously need to do something about their fail food.  They got the business, the hype, and good reputation as a hotspot, so why not live up to the hype?

After 9 pm though, this place becomes a whole different atmosphere.  It's an outdoor club basically sitting over the lake with a magnificent view of Cleveland.  The music is usually pretty good with some amazing Dj's.  For a Saturday Summer Night out, it's definitely the spot to be."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The only thing I don't like about this place is the cover, but i'm not going to lie sometimes its worth it.  Some nights when the weather isn't great the crowd isn't amazing but other nights under a bright starry night with great music, the night is young and fun.  They have a really cool patio and patio bar that make this place a prime hangout spot on gorgeous cleveland nights.  The drinks are a bit more expensive then I realized but bar drinks are bar drinks.  The inside seating looked extensive and went all the way back to porch seating as well.  I'll have to try the food one night hopefully I can come up with a 5 star :)"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a week on business and must say this was the best dinner I had! We sat outside and watched the passing boats pass through the draw bridge (it lifts up, not sure if this is technically a draw bridge). A great experience. Service was great and friendly.

I had the salmon and vegetables, it was delicious,  If business brings me back to Cleveland, I would look forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with friends and I must say it wasn't a bad first time experience. Apart from the hostess at the door was really nonchalant. When we first walked in the place was empty which was to be expected since the rib cook off was that same weekend however the hostess didn't even bother to show us where to sit. I'm not to sure if she was suppose to walk us to our table but we informed her that we wanted to sit outside for the view. And her dry response was, \"well you can pick from upstairs or downstairs. Choice is yours. But we are packed.\" Imagine my facial expressions.


Our waiter was amazing!!!!! It was her 1st weekend to work and you couldn't tell! She was beyond polite, really friendly and gave her honest opinion about the food which was an added bonus. by the way I would recommend the berry/peach drink. Virgin or non virgin. Which ever tickles your fancy :)"}
{"text":"Family of 5 dined here this evening. We all had the same thoughts- food was great- maybe unexpectedly so- but definitely very good! We were all pleased with our appetizer and entrees. Service was pretty horrendous however. Server couldn't have cared less. But, pretty scenery, beautiful evening, good food and great company! I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Nancy NGO and Kelsey are the best bartenders in Cleveland. Provided great drinks and entertainment at the outdoor bar even though it was like sitting under a misting fan."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere at this place! I just had calamari appetizer and it was great! Had a few drinks and enjoyed watching the ships go by."}
{"text":"Always a blast at Shooters! Great location, and great music.
Food is not that good though, and they need cameras in their parking lot."}
{"text":"The view is the only nice part of this place. Their service wasn't bad, but that is probably because it was dead at 6pm on a Friday night. RED ALERT! We came because it was advertised as seafood. Very wrong. The salad was poor iceberg lettuce with hidden valley ranch.- yuk. The French onion soup was pretty good. Alfredo both chicken and shrimp were awful. My bud light was my favorite part of dinner here."}
{"text":"Shooters reminds me of an old rock band who's past their prime. A tired old band who refuses to stop touring. The attention they attract is a shell of it's former rock star self, yet Shooters remains, even despite all of the younger, hipper, more attractive watering holes opening up in the cooler sections of town. It's glory days are long over, yet Shooters continues to deny it's inevitable fate. To me, I find that both respectable & pathetic at the same time.

Shooters is one of the last living, but barely breathing bars left in the flats. At one point, it was even considered the anchor to a very vibrant West Bank filled with buzzing nightclubs. Reminiscing of those days are kind of like reminiscing of a band in their glory days even though present day reality would reveal to be more weathered than Keith Richard's skin. 

I was told Shooters was one of the places I visited on my 21st B-day. (The day is still a haze). And from what I remember, it was a good time! It was exciting being in the big city, all grown up, being able to swill booze (legally) like all the big kids. I loved the way the deck area overlooked the Cuyahoga and the East Bank of the flats. Later in the night, the place transformed into a raucous dance party of drunken debauchery.

I remember a Rod Stewart look-alike dancing the night away in a periwinkle blue leisure suit, frat boys pissing off the dock into nearby boats and overindulged bachelorettes on a mission to end the night projectile vomiting into the river. All to the rhythmic steady beats of corny club music. Now, THIS was great entertainment!

But I'd soon come to learn that Shooter's wasn't the end all be all among cool places to hang by the lake. For one, it's cool factor died off around the same time the whole grunge thing of the 90's went by the wayside. And like any cool band, Shooters would soon wear out it's welcome and novelty among the early supporters too. Luckily for Shooters though, they are still supported by a few groupies looking to relive the great memories of the past. For most, memories are all this place has going for it anymore."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the chicken BLT wrap. It was OK. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. Great setting on the water. Pretty indifferent about the place altogether."}
{"text":"Had great food & good service. Ricky was our server & did a great job!! We just finished the Brewboat cruise."}
{"text":"You can't beat the view and convenience of the location. I haven't eaten here in years but my friend wanted to go, so well, I went. I agree it's a great place for drinking and dancing, but the food tonight was a pleasant surprise!! I ordered the salmon entree with seasonal vegetables and baked sweet potato. It was well prepared and quite frankly damn delicious!! My friend had the chopped salad and he had nothing but compliments and was more than pleased with the large portion of it. He also had the seasonal blueberry beer and was happy. The service was fantastic despite nearly being closing time. They were attentive and friendly! So yeah, delicious food, great service AND on the river?! I changed my mind about only drinking too much and dancing the night away on the river. I'll be back for dinner that's for sure! (Sucks that east bank is taking their business with overpriced crappy food yet the same great location! Stick to shooters)"}
{"text":"We were there on a Sunday at 3:30 with a party of 22 for my parents 50th wedding anniversary after a lolly the trolley tour of Cleveland which was awesome. Even though they do not take reservations at Shooters, we let them know ahead of time that we would be there and they had the tables ready for us. The servers were nice, took a while for food which is understandable for a party of 22; the food kind of came out with long periods of time between everyone's meal but it is what it is. It was a great day, the Tribe game was on, everyone was talking and enjoying themselves so it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone enjoyed their food. The calamari was good. I had the pulled pork sandwich, thought it was pretty good. Other orders that got positive feedback were the burgers, lobster roll, strawberry salad. We brought in a cake so we had that for dessert. All in all it was a very good time. And the Tribe won in extra innings."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I got the grilled chicken sandwich. It was super overpriced though. 50 dollars for two meals and a drink is ridiculous. Each of mine and my boyfriends meals were 15 dollars and the drink was 13. This was all for lunch too, not even dinner. The views made up for the large bill, but I definitely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went in with very high expectations for Shooters.

While the restaurant was very clean, had a good atmosphere, and nice live music, the service was poor. Our entrees came at the same time as our appetizers, and by the time our drinks came we didn't want them. For the prices being a little steeper, I was surprised when I had to send my martini back, because I didn't think it had alcohol in it.

Shooters is a place to visit for the ambiance and scenery, but sadly, not for any type of special night out."}
{"text":"How is this place still open?!  If crap service and creepy middle aged white guys wearing effeminate footwear is your thing, then by all means swing your paddleboat up to the dock!!  The 90s are over guys...let it go..."}
{"text":"Came there on a Saturday night and that will be the last time I go there. We asked the bartender if we could order food at the bar and the guy yelled at us. Then we sat down and it was easy 20 minutes before a server came over to us. The server, she was at least nice to us. The food was good. I strongly would suggest going somewhere else. There were other little things that happened that made us shake our heads in disbelief too. I honestly felt like I was undercover for bar rescue in one of those places they tend to go. This place used to be great, I'm not sure what happened, but it needs some serious changes."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awful. I thought they had recently renovated it but that doesn't seem to be the case. The service was so terrible we literally waited 20 minutes to order our drinks. They are severely under staffed. There were only 2 bartenders working behind a huge bar. And they take their sweet time.

After I ordered from the bartender she started making other people's drinks and completely forgot about us. I was like, I think you forgot about us and she said oh I totally did. Yikes! $16 for two drinks was also crazy. I understand they have a nice view on the water but the overall experience is lacking. There was food sitting on tables that had not been bussed and seagulls were fighting over the food ha! I will not be coming back to say the least. We only came here because we were going to a concert at Jacob's Pavilion. You're better off going to any other bar in the Flats."}
{"text":"We stopped in shooters before heading to a concert across the parking lot. The atmosphere is fun laid back and beachy for a nice summer day or night and I'd imagine if you had a boat this would be a great stop. 

I'd like to echo the awful service comment. We had seats at the bar and it still probably took us 20 minutes to flag someone down per drink. The beers were $8 (whether you got a summer shandy or a GLB feature) a piece which, considering is the same price as those within the concert venue, is rather high. The food is more moderately priced than the alcohol, in my opinion, but it took 3 times speaking at a bartender for them to actually acknowledge we asked for a menu. 

This would be a fun place if you are looking for something different to do on a nice day and not on a time or budget restraint. I would come here again if I was in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip out for it."}
{"text":"I guess you have to come here for the friends and experience.  The food is definitely Meh.  This is definitely a bar/dance club first and a restaurant 2nd.

The food is a bit pricey for what you get.  This is pretty typical food, burgers, salads, etc.  The one high point, the calamari.  The calamari is cooked to perfection and the sauces on the side are a great addition.  

This is a great location with a great patio though.  So if you are looking for a place to hang out for dinner than not have to go far for drinks and dancing than this is the place for you.  Plenty of bars make it really easy to get a drink and the views on the river are spectacular.  

4-stars as a hang out spot, but only 2 stars as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fun place to go as a C-town tourist on a sunny day. They had a surprising number of tasty no-meat options. While I was there for lunch, it looked like they have the potential to be a fun waterside bar at night. Loved watching the water, the boats and the freight trains go by. Fun for all the transportation-lovers in your life!!"}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place.  Parking for $6 was so cheap and affordable.  Good food, great service and excellent drink choices.  The atmosphere is lively and on the water with a beautiful view no matter where one sits or stands.  The outdoor bar was a great add-on as there were bands outside and its nice to have the option to sit in or out.  Please get rid of the plastic cups though...mixed drinks taste way better out of real glasses."}
{"text":"Word of caution to any ladies that would be enticed by the dancing and crowds of the shithole known as Shooters on the Water:

My Fiance went there this last weekend for her bachelorette party with a few friends. She is a big fan of dancing and has even been taking ball room lessons for the past few years. It is something that she loves to do and Shooters large outdoor deck has been a place for her and her friends to go for a long time. The night was going great from what I have been told and everyone was enjoying themselves from what I gather. That's when all hell broke loose. My soon to be wife was heading towards the door around 1:30 in the morning and was attacked by some animal for accidentally bumping into some crazy bitch that was obviously high on something. I make that assumption because it took three of my Fiances friends to pull her off before security was able to get there. Security escorted the psycho out of the club while the friends of my battered significant other pleaded with them to hold onto her so that the could get ahold of the police. Needless to say they didn't. The bitch was let go nether to be seen from again. My Fiance and I contacted Shooters later on in the day of the incident to ask if a copy of their security footage could be made so that we could try to identify the lady who went of on my Fiance and we were told to call back the following day when management was available. The next day we were told that the footage had been erased and there was nothing they could do. Geez, thanks a whole fucking lot!! My Fiance is a sweet woman from the suburbs. She has never been in a fight in her entire life and was out having fun to celebrate our upcoming marriage. This was supposed to be a great night for her and everyone she was with. Well that is definitely not the memory  she will have. She literally looks like she has been in a boxing match and had lost horribly. This is not an exaggeration. The thought of her laying there defenseless on the ground getting pummeled only to have security escort the lady out with no information taken has kept me up the last two nights. 

I have been there before in my youth and have had fun but will never step foot in that establishment again. I beg any woman who would think of going there to at least keep this story in the back of your mind and to watch you back. You can get the shit kicked out of you for no apparent reason and with no retribution at good all Shooters On the Water. It's happened once and no doubt will happen again!!"}
{"text":"One would think a restaurant/bar on the water would be a really cool place to hang out on a sunny, warm and breezy day.  The open air bar on the river had all the ingredients of a fun afternoon spent gazing at the boats with a drink in hand, shooting the breeze.  It could have been....but the bartenders apparently weren't interested in actually tending bar.  Both young chicks stood with their backs to the long, long bar and never looked to see if customers needed anything.  We had to flag them down to get our first drink.   She was busy talking to the other bartender so it took a while for her to mosey over.  We ordered drinks.  Eh....nothing to write home about.  The first drink was the last one....wasn't worth the effort or our time.

Awful view.  The occasional boats that went by were the only respite from the wasteland on the shore across the water.   Hopefully some day the view AND the service will improve!"}
{"text":"Hours 11:30-2:00 I got there at 12:30 this large bar was not busy yet, but there are several bars. I walked around looking for a bar to order and went where I saw a person and I sat and waited about 2 minutes while she finished stocking items. I said politely \" excuse me may I order a ...\". Her rude response was \"you can start by going to a bar that is open\". As if I was to know which of their several bars was open or closed, there were no signs. Instead of looking for an open bar I left and pledged to never return. RUDE SERVICE."}
{"text":"The location and view at this place totally saves it. 

We were nearby for a Cleveland Trolley tour and really wanted to eat somewhere close/in the Flats for a late lunch. This place is right on the water, and we could leave our car at the Aquarium parking lot and walk over. There is a huge wooden dock, and since it was a beautiful day there were plenty of boats parked nearby and people enjoying drinks on the patio. We had a larger group, so we opted to sit indoors in the area that is indoors but has a big open area that faces the water - so, best of both worlds. The decor is straight out of the 80's, but it does almost give you the feeling of being at some kind of older beach resort. 

The food here is overpriced and uninspired. Also, how can you be out of walleye when you are LITERALLY on lake Erie? Like, give me a net and I'll go scoop some up right now. $16 is way too much for a breaded perch sandwich and fries. I think this place could get away with charging this price if the food was a little better, but it seems they are just capitalizing on their location/being in a touristy area. The beer was expensive and the draft list was kind of boring considering how many great breweries are within a 30 mile radius. They only had 2 Great Lakes drafts, and everything else was a macro brew. 

We got the chance to see a HUGE freighter boat navigate past the restaurant, so that was the only highlight. I would maybe come back for a drink, but mostly just to hang out on the dock."}
{"text":"No vegan options available. The impossible burger's bun has dairy in it. Would love to see them make an improvement to their menu to cater to different (and in demand) diets."}
{"text":"So it's October 19th potentially the final game of the AL championship. It's the 4th inning I walk in to shooters, a great place to party for the last 7-8 years..... not a single person, game not on TV. I ask them which bar to sit at and nobody is at any bar... they have to open a bar just for me. (Wednesday night at 5:30) bartender barely says a word as she hands me my $5 bud light bottle.... the manager walks over reaches in the cooler pours himself a shot of vodka,
Slams it and then turns the TVs on.... took a freakin shot before turning TVs on..... took pictures and videos of the whole experience that I am happy to post :)"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of shooters for my entire life. Whether it's Mother's Day brunch or graduation or regular dinner time it's been a go to place when I was in Cleveland with my family. I was SO excited to show this place off to my boyfriend and friends that hadn't been being we were meeting for a birthday. 

Our party (who was a total of 9 people before 3 of us arrived) received their food before the drinks. I personally had to walk down to the bar and double fist multiple waters to bring to the table that we had asked for as soon as we walked in. 

Our shrimp scampi appetizer that was 15$ had 4 shrimp and a shit ton of onion straws. However, our Cuban was pretty good. 

I had talked to the manager letting her know a lot of us were in the service industry and we didn't want to be a hassle but definitely had to entertain the issue at hand. We saw our server TWICE! I try to be as understanding as possible when it comes to these situations but I had to say something. The manager ended up buying us a round of drinks for our entire party which was very nice but overall I was very disappointed. Especially because it was for a birthday at our party."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for the food which was average.  Received the check and they automatically added 18% gratuity for a table of 4.  Only good for drinks and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disgusting food.  Disgusting decor. Disgusting service.  Disgusting prices. Beautiful view of the water!"}
{"text":"Bonus points for the awesome location, but that's about the only good thing about this place. Service is slow and inattentive. Three people in our party were told the drinks they wanted weren't available; the mixed drinks we did get were awful. One person's beer never came (thankfully we weren't charged). Not enough napkins or silverware on the table so we just grabbed some extras off a bussing station. (If you're wondering why we didn't ask the waitress, she disappeared after our food arrived and didn't come back until we were ready to pay.)

The food is mediocre at best -- about as good as the frozen food you can buy at the grocery store. The bathrooms were a mess as well (a dirty mop had been left out so at least they clean sometimes I guess?)

Might be a decent place to have a beer and enjoy the view, but not recommended for anything more than that!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best view. You're sitting right on the lake watching the boats pass. We didn't have any problem with service, and the server was nice. The food was lovely and had good choices."}
{"text":"The service is terrible, I just watch this blonde bartender at the outside patio with star tattoos on her shoulder blades do her laundry on the barware!!! Ewwww The health board needs to come in here and shut these people down I can only imagine what's going on in the back"}
{"text":"Shooters is the last bar standing in the flats.  Well, almost.  I'm glad to see that Shooters has survived the turmoil that is the Cleveland Flats.  Hopefully, the Flats will live again.

I used to visit Shooters when I was in college.  It actually had a decent bar scene including live DJ's, great music and some very hot women strutting around.  Every time I visit shooters, I see at least three 10's walking around.  No lie.  Maybe it's because the strippers from the club next door drink there.

In the summer, boats dock at Shooters, which creates a very cool scene.  Boats, strippers, beer, what more could a guy want?

Shooters has really good food.  I've eaten here several times over the years and it never disappoints.  On my most recent trip, my wife and I were joined by our financial advisor and his fiancee.  It was a Thursday evening, 7:00 PM and the place was really busy.  All of the outside tables were taken as well as most of the inside tables.

I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was delish.  We ordered  calamari and spinach dip as appetizers.  Bother were really tasty.  We opted for the calamari with peppers and man was it good.  The calamari was fried to perfection and had a very nice chew to it.  The spinach dip was also very good and the portions of both appetizers was very pleasing.

On to dinner.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with mashed potatoes.  The chicken didn't have as much kick as I was expecting, but it was still good.  It wasn't out of this world, but I would eat it again.  The mashed potatoes had a nice texture, but they were bland.  I make better mashed potatoes at home, I'm sorry to report.

All of the meals were good or even great and the view at this restaurant/bar is just terrific.  Given a sunny day, this is one of the best spots to sit and dine in Cleveland.  For the price, you can't beat it.  For four people with drinks plus tip, our bill came to $165 and my advisor expensed it ;-)

Our server was very fast and polite.

{"text":"I've been here on only one occasion and, believe me, that was enough.  You know you're at a janky bar/restaurant/club/(whatever this is trying to be) when you go to the bathroom and someone almost jumps you because you don't have a lighter.  Seriously, that's very indicative of the low-class urchins...er..ahem..patrons that appear to frequent this bar.  Seriously, as soon as the sun went down and the moon rose this place turned into a horror show of people.  
       Oh, the food was really yummy buuuut it took a little over two hours, yes, TWO HOURS for our group of twelve to be served our dinners. One of our friends also wasn't told that what she ordered was unavailable until 45 minutes after she ordered. Absolutely unacceptable.  The drink my girlfriend got, a frozen margarita, tasted of pure sugar and no alcohol.  I'm not one to skimp out on anything, but frozen kool-aid pretending to be alcohol is not worth the $9 that drink cost.  The waitress also only refilled my water once over this three hour span as she seemingly went MIA.
       After sundown this place also turned into the weirdest (and not in a good way) mix of probably the worst CLE has to offer...30K millionaire d-bags, creepy old dudes, sloppy drunk 30something women, thug wannabes, the list goes on.  
       In summation, if you don't want to feel like you're about to get stabbed whilst in a restroom, vomited on, or creeped on, avoid Shooters and head to a classy joint like TownHall in Ohio City or Treehouse in Tremont."}
{"text":"The bar is a classic Cleveland staple but a five dollar cover charge is sad when there is no one in the whole place. It really doesn't make any sense when you want people."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents for lunch as it was right next door to a place called Art on Wheels (http://www.aowinc.com/), and came highly recommended. Uh yeah, NOT good, even in the least.  The best thing was sitting out on the patio and having Blue Moon on tap. We went over at 11. They were open, although not ready to serve anyone. When they did, it was phenomenally subpar. We had macadamia-nut encrusted brie, which, on top of being $12, was small and hadn't even the slightest hint of macadamia nut. I ordered the rasta pasta (what a cheesy name) without chicken. The sauce was far too runny, and the mushrooms were canned. My mom ordered the chopped salad, and in no way resembled a chopped salad of any sort, and on top of that, they didn't even remember to ask her what kind of dressing she wanted, so she sat there with a dry salad for a good five minutes. It is the summer, and along with that comes training a bunch of kids out of school for the summer. For the 3 of us, all of whom got a drink, I think it came out to be $66. Not bad, but it's pretty clear that they are not so strong in the \"gourmet food\" section as they'd like you to think.

Many people in here have talked about how the flatlands are dead, or that this is the only happening place now in the flatlands. Well, the flatlands are now undergoing major renovations, which can either be the death or the good fortune of this place. It's not often I say this, but I personally am rooting for their death (not personally as in I want the waiters dead, I just want someplace to open up in its stead)."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, drinks are always yummy. The view is spectacular and there's usually good music or a dj playing outside in the summer time. Personally I think the drinks and food is a bit pricey, however this is prime real estate so I suppose it comes with the territory. Oh and this is \"the\" place to be so there is a diverse crowd of boaters and patrons; some older and others right off the Jersey shore."}
{"text":"Tried Shooters on the Water because we were attending a concert across the parking lot. There was a band playing so very loud, so it might have been fun if you were just having drinks.  Typical bar food, but overpriced for what it is.  Limited healthy options on the menu, so I ordered a Cobb salad, and for $14 I think any fast food restaurant's salad would taste better than their Cobb salad, sadly I didn't eat it and went to the concert hungry.  I will NOT dine here again!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there last Saturday, and had one of the worst restaurant meals ever.  I ordered the gluten-free rice noodles with veggies.  It was too spicy, too salty, and too sweet--in fact, after I was done (and I didn't finish that slop), I was trying to wipe the sticky residue off of my mouth in the restroom!  I've never had that happen to me!  Did I mention that the rice noodles were undercooked?  I didn't send the pathetic plate back because I was on a date and didn't want to seem disagreeable.

And they don't have hard cider!  I will not go back there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I went there last night. Sitting at home and drinking Crystal Head vodka is way better. This place is a major buzz kill and I will never revisit that experience. I think I am going to boycott this place like I did to the South Side."}
{"text":"There are only a few moments in a person's life that are so incredibly horrifying that they stick with them forever. Examples of these are things like parents divorcing, the premature death of one's child, the discovery of a spouse's infidelity, and yes indeed, a weekend afternoon spent on the Shooters patio. 

I wish I was exaggerating. Seriously. Go anywhere else. Even Canada. Just don't go here."}
{"text":"Just went there on Friday night and all I have to say is that the Flats are not dead, as a lot of people told us they were when we were out in the seemingly more hip Warehouse district. My friend and I thought it was a grand time, lots of fun and single folks carousing around, and it's right on the water so it's pretty fun just to enjoy a hot night in Cleveland! I'd recommend Shooter's if you're looking for some good times and to meet some cool folks that are ready to party!"}
{"text":"Shooters is the place to be in Cleveland ESPECIALLY in the summer! This place gets packed and you'll like it best if you are on the outside deck so you can watch the boats go by in the river. The place is huge and they have a good menu. I love their salads and the different special drinks they have! At night this place even gets a little rowdy!"}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland for a work conference, we wanted a restaurant with reasonable prices on the riverfront. Their menu looked varied and in our price range. We arrived and requested to sit on the patio; it was a beautiful evening, although it had rained earlier in the day. The hostesses told us the patio was closed. When our server arrived, I again requested to move to the patio and he explained that the manager did not want anyone sitting outside because it might rain. In a last attempt, I showed him the weather forecast and that it predicted 0% rain for the rest of the night. We were still denied a patio table. The manager kept eyeballing our table and glaring at us, instead of coming over to explain why he decided the patio should be closed. The food was nothing special. I would not recommend visiting this place."}
{"text":"I am not reviewing this place for their food. This review is only for their nightlife. In the summer, this is one of my favorite club scenes to go to!  They have the biggest outdoor dance floor and stage in Cleveland!  Definitely a great time if you are looking for excellent outdoor nightlife!  They are located right at the lake so you also get to enjoy the great view (and unfortunately dead Lake Erie fishy smell). There is a dock, so there are always people that pull up on their boats.

I have gone here on Sundays for day drinking and the crowd is interesting. It's mostly meat heads and cocky people who wear their best clubbing outfit. It's Sunday afternoon people, and you're at a bar...to each their own I guess."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here today and the day was beautiful, as was the scenery. Our table was comfortable and we had plenty of space to move around.

However, the food was a bit disappointing, with portions being rather small and a bit over-priced for what was offered. I had a walleye sandwich, which came broiled instead of deep-fried as I requested (I kept it anyway). The fish itself was great, well seasoned and baked nicely, but the 'mixed green salad' that came with it was nothing more than bagged iceberg lettuce.  Had I not ordered a baked potato as an extra side, I would have left hungry.  The potato was solid, but then again baked potatoes are hard to mess up :)"}
{"text":"Thought this might be a worn out hang out for young people on the West Bank, so I was very very pleased to see it large, airy and clean with a great view of the river.  The menu had a variety of offerings.  Portions were large.  A nice bar area.  Plan $16-18 for lunch.  Service was good.  A deck allows patrons to view the river and boats up close.   Check  it out with a drink.  Three stars for high lunch prices."}
{"text":"What was I thinking that I have not been back to the reinvigorated Flats area in so very long?  A delightful and fun flashback of a place that I used to enjoy.

Now on to the food, or shall I say what was left. We had a table of nine and four of us were told \"we are out of that.\"  Our waiter who normally may be a Rain Man type person was off his game. Drinks never came to the table, he brought an extra drink from somebody else's table that they apparently didn't order, and the food for one in our party was never even placed. Someone give this guy a pen and a pad.  Our overall experience was not good. That being said I, the three of us that ordered burgers were very happy.  I had the one topped with prime rib. The others were not as pleased.

Simply because of nostalgia, I was hoping to give a better rating. In good conscience I can't. I will try some of the newer places the next time I'm in The Flats which won't be long."}
{"text":"I've been going to Shooters once or twice a year since it opened. I don't go more often because they charge a lot for food which is, frankly, sub par. 

Today I ordered the Ultimate Burger. I ordered the burger cooked medium and when it arrived, it did have a little blue plastic sign that read \"medium\". That was the only hint that my waiter heard my request.  The burger lacked even the slightest hint of pink. 

I did bring this to the attention of my waiter, and that was the last I heard of the matter. No adjustment, no offer to take the food back, no attempt at all to make it right. 

Shooters is a great spot to spend time by the river. Eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"Made my first trip ever to Shooters, & I was not disappointed. Very cool, fun place. Andy was my bartender, & he was outstanding. He was super sweet, very knowledgeable about the menu, & made me some kick ass drinks! Having Andy take care of me made my experience that much more memorable. I will be back for more fun & awesome drinks made by Andy!!"}
{"text":"This place probably has the best view of downtown Cleveland and riverfront setting of any restaurant in Cleveland. If you visit Cleveland--which all of you should!--coming here for a beer and an appetizer is definitely something that you should do. Sitting outside on the river on a nice summer evening makes for a great way to enjoy a Cleveland night. 

I have been here three times, and following the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) is the key to finding good cuisine at this restaurant. When myself or my guests ordered complicated, exotic food, it didn't turn out well. When we've ordered simple food, it was great. If you want seafood or something else fancy, go to Pier W or Sans Souci. Order a burger or something pretty standard here and you'll be great!

Also, the service leaves much to be desired. Don't expect a quick meal! But hey, with the nice view and ambiance, why would you want one?

All in all, Shooter's is a Cleveland landmark that is a must-visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to Shooters several times since its opening, however, this is first time back in a couple of years. It had gone down hill over the years, but since it was a nice day thought we would give it a try again. 

We went in the middle of the day on Saturday and was able to score a table outside immediately. They still have the policy of finding your own seating outside. 

There were seven in our party and while our server, Heather, was attentive, service was slow as in the past. There always seems to be plenty of servers so not sure if it is the kitchen or servers, but never has service been quick. 

I ordered the fish tacos and had to hunt through the slaw to find the small piece of fish, perhaps the worst fish tacos ever. If they are going to give you such a small portion of fish they should at least serve in a small taco shell, but it was served in a large soft tortilla which just made it worse. 

The food here is definitely below average. I know the appeal is the water and view, but I don't think that should give the management permission to serve mediocre food and slow service. 

The next time I feel the urge for a waterside view I will make my way to Merwin's Wharf."}
{"text":"The music was good. Drinks were perfect, the scenery was nice. Good vibes and good people. This is the only city I have been to in the Midwest that has an east coast feel to it."}
{"text":"Ambiance and location is off the charts for a beach, waterfront vibe.  Not much in CLEVELAND offers this.  Food is very good, with lots of options.  Service is notoriously awful and indifferent which can ruin an experience quickly unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have to give Shooters 5 stars...I had way to many fun times here not to.  Their food is only so-so but I love their outdoor deck and have listened to a lot of live bands and danced my butt off to DJ's many a night.

During the day it is sort of a family-friendly restaurant then slowly starts to morph into a dance club in the afternoon usually starting with a live band before the DJ starts up.  Great place to watch the sunset!"}
